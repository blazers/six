<span class="headword">Bain,  James Thompson</span>  (1860&#150;1919), <span class="occ">trade unionist in South Africa</span>, was born at Dudhope Crescent, Dundee, on 6 March 1860, the third child of Andrew Bain and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson. His parents were both mill workers. At the age of seven he started work in a factory. At sixteen he joined the 13th (Prince Albert's) light infantry. After training he was sent, in 1878, to join the first battalion of the regiment, which was then the main unit enforcing the British occupation of the Transvaal. He saw combat in the campaign against Sekukuni in 1878 and the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. On returning to England he was reallocated to the second battalion of the 13th, then in India, and spent two years on garrison duty at Kamptee, near Nagpur.<br>
<br>In 1883 Bain, now back in Scotland, was placed on the reserve, and at a relatively advanced age commenced his apprenticeship as a fitter. He was a voracious autodidact reader, and in this period developed a lifelong fascination with the writings of Thomas Carlyle. The young man was drawn into radical politics, becoming a member of the Scottish Land and Labour League, a group affiliated with William Morris's Socialist League. Bain heard Morris speak, and became a devotee of Morris's thought.<br>
<br>In 1888&#150;9 Bain worked as a fitter in South America, probably in Buenos Aires. By early 1890 he had moved to Cape Town, where he became active in local British immigrant trade unionism. There he met Charity Martha Hermina van der Riet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bell), from Bredasdorp in the Cape. Following her divorce from her previous husband, they married and had three children&#151;Archibald (<i>b</i>. 1890/92), Olive (<i>b</i>. 1896), and James (<i>b</i>. 1906).<br>
<br>After a brief stay in Kimberley the couple settled in Johannesburg, where Bain found work in his trade. In 1892 he was the central leader in the founding of the first significant trade union movement in the Transvaal, the Witwatersrand Mine Employees and Mechanics Union, also known as the Labour Union, which focused on organizing British, Australian, and North American immigrants. He developed a political position that combined fierce anti-capitalist hostility to the mine owners with a racist protectionism of the position of white workers against the competition of the cheap labour of people of colour. This was to be his characteristic viewpoint in his subsequent political career.<br>
<br>The Transvaal was by now back under Boer rule. Bain developed a strong sympathy for the Afrikaners, whom he saw as defending a bucolic way of life against the rapacious capitalism of the mine owners. After internal disputes in the Labour Union and allegations of corruption against Bain, he pulled out of the movement. In 1896 his allegiance to the Boer cause led him to accept a position as a secret agent for the police of the Transvaal republic. He undertook some assignments gathering information on prostitution and drink rackets, but his main task was to spy on the pro-British organizations in the Johannesburg area. The year 1899 saw Bain emerge as editor of the <span class="italic">Johannesburg Witness</span>, a publication that managed to combine radical socialism with support for Paul Kruger's republic. The <span class="italic">Witness</span> was clandestinely financed by the Transvaal government. Bain made an unsuccessful attempt to establish an International Independent Labour Party in Johannesburg, collaborating in this venture with Robert Noonan, later to become known as Robert Tressell, author of the socialist novel <span class="italic">The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</span>, who was then resident in the Transvaal.<br>
<br>When the South African War broke out in 1899 Bain decided to fight for the Boers. He joined the Irish brigade commanded by the American soldier J. Y. F. Blake and the Fenian John MacBride. Bain participated in the fighting in Natal. After the British captured Johannesburg in mid-1900 Bain was imprisoned in the city's fort and threatened with execution for treason. In the end he was sent to Ceylon, where he was held in the prisoner-of-war camp at Diyatalawa for two years.<br>
<br>On returning to the Transvaal Bain worked at his trade, first in Johannesburg (1903&#150;6), then in Pretoria (1906&#150;9), and subsequently on the Cullinan diamond mine (1909&#150;12). During this period he became something of an elder statesman to the growing immigrant labour movement in the Transvaal. He was active in the local branches of the British Amalgamated Society of Engineers, in the Transvaal Independent Labour Party (1906&#150;9), and in the South African Labour Party (from 1909 onward). In 1907 he organized a march of the unemployed from Johannesburg to Pretoria. He played a part in hosting the visits of important British socialist leaders to South Africa, including those of James Keir Hardie, Tom Mann, and Dora Montefiore. He was influenced by the doctrines of syndicalism and contributed to the Johannesburg syndicalist paper the <span class="italic">Voice of Labour</span>. At the first election for the Union of South Africa parliament Bain stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the South African Labour Party in the Pretoria North constituency.<br>
<br>Charity Bain died in 1906 following the birth of James junior. In 1911 Bain married Nora Borrowman, a British immigrant. They had no children.<br>
<br>Bain was chosen in April 1913 as full-time organizer for the Transvaal Industrial Federation. The next month a strike by white workers broke out in the mining town of Benoni. Bain not only took the leadership of the movement, but used it to generate a full-scale confrontation over wages and conditions between white labour and the mine owners' organization. Two months of fierce clashes between the police and strikers followed, and the strike spread along the East Rand. By the beginning of July Bain was able to force the calling of a general strike. On 4 July 1913, at a mass rally in central Johannesburg, after a speech by Bain, the strikers were charged by police and British troops. A night of arson and looting followed. On the next day the Royal Dragoons killed over twenty demonstrators in the city. Bain and his colleagues met the prime minister, Louis Botha, and the defence minister, Jan Smuts, in tense negotiations. The result was a triumph for the unions, with the government and the mine owners conceding virtually all the trade unionists' demands.<br>
<br>In January 1914 a second strike broke out. But this one was ill prepared, and Smuts directed an operation aimed at extracting revenge for the humiliation inflicted on the government the year before. Martial law was declared and the newly formed Union Defence Force was deployed to enforce it. Bain and hundreds of others were arrested. Smuts then had Bain and eight other strike leaders deported to Britain. In doing so he acted without legal authority and had to claim retrospective indemnity from parliament. The South African government's action generated an enormous outcry in British trade-union and socialist circles. On arriving in London, Bain and his comrades found themselves heroes to the left. A major campaign on behalf of the deportees culminated on 1 March 1914 in Hyde Park in the largest single demonstration of the British left before the First World War.<br>
<br>During the next few months Bain lived as a pensioner of British labour organizations. This limbo-like existence came to an end with the outbreak of the First World War. Botha had to allow the deportees to return to South Africa in order to gain the South African Labour Party's support for his war effort.<br>
<br>Back in Johannesburg Bain found work at the power station. He joined the International Socialist League, a breakaway anti-war faction of the South African Labour Party. But Bain quickly fell out with S. P. Bunting, the proto-communist leader of the league. Ostracized by both the party and the league, Bain became isolated politically. He confined himself to working in the South African branches of the Workers' Educational Association and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.<br>
<br>In March&#150;April 1919 a strike by the power-station workers in Johannesburg developed into a general confrontation between the city employees and the authorities. Bain led the labour movement in the seizure of the Johannesburg municipal offices. They established a board of control for the city, chaired by Bain and ostensibly modelled on the Russian soviets. But after the city conceded most of the strikers' practical demands the movement fizzled out. Later that year, on 29 October 1919, Bain died in Johannesburg General Hospital following an operation. He was accorded a mass funeral by the local labour organizations, and was buried in Johannesburg on 1 November.<br>
<br>Bain was loathed by his many enemies, foremost among them Jan Smuts, who told the South African parliament that signing an agreement with Bain was the hardest thing he had ever had to do in his public life, a humiliation and a disgrace. Allegations of financial corruption in the Labour Union hung over Bain for many years and in the 1890s he was notorious for his temper and violent inclinations. Yet after his return from the South African War Bain became revered and indeed loved by many of his comrades in the labour movement. He, more than any other single individual, can be regarded as the founder of trade unionism in southern Africa. The form in which he pursued it involved defence of the privileged position of white workers, but there is some slight evidence that towards the end of his life he started to become more sympathetic to the plight of black labour. And in 1914, for a brief and now forgotten moment, he was a national hero to the British left.<br>
