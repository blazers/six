<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobell,  Sydney Thompson</span>  (1824&#150;1874), <span class="occ">poet and literary scholar</span>, was born on 5 April 1824 at Cranbrook in Kent, the eldest son in the family of ten children of John Dobell, wine merchant and author, and Julietta Thompson, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27276/', "Samuel Thompson (1766&#150;1837)")</script>, a religious reformer, who founded the Freethinking Christians, a church based on primitive Christianity. He was also a descendant of Daniel Dobell (<i>b</i>. 1700), a Quaker of Cranbrook. Dobell's father, who had published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Man Unfit to Govern Man</span>, moved from Kent to Cheltenham in 1836. Sydney inherited from both parents strong religious convictions, such as Judaic exclusiveness, with its insistence on separation from the world, which accounted for Sydney's extreme individualism. He was educated entirely at home, where he was given a sense of his uniqueness and brilliance. Schooling might have weakened his precocity, but lack of it might also have deprived him of effective external criticism.<br>
<br>By the time Sydney Dobell reached adolescence he was already caught up in a sensitive analysis of individual experience and feeling. An ardent admirer of <span class="italic">Manfred</span>, Byron's exploration of the tyranny of reason, Dobell memorized whole sections of the poem which, his biographer claimed, he knew &#145;by heart&#146;  (Jolly, 1.37). Dobell is perhaps one of the most representative figures of the transition between Romantic and Victorian sensibilities. He seems to have had a deeper psychological grasp of the conflicting demands of Romantic self-consciousness and Victorian social earnestness than his contemporaries.<br>
<br>As a dissenter, Dobell was well aware that religion was beginning to lose its hold. He felt that God designed each soul to find its own creed out of an individual experience of scripture  (<span class="italic">Thoughts</span>, 153). Dobell's was a deliberate attempt to concretize religious abstractions like love, purity, and freedom, and to enable poetry to embody states of mind like guilt, fear, national pride, and ambition. By means of the confessional mode he tried to dramatize in his poetry how divisions between people and nations, and especially divisions between the sexes (he was a believer in rights for women), could be assimilated into a new creation.<br>
<br>Dobell became engaged to Emily Fordham in 1839 and married her on 18 July 1844. They had no children. Emily seems to have rescued Sydney from the burden of perfectionism, a harsh asceticism, and a rigorous work ethic that had been imposed on him by loving but stern parents. At some time after 1847 John Dobell gave his son the management of the Gloucester branch of his wine business, and the young Dobells lived at Lark Hay in the village of Hucclecote, where Sydney began work on his first major poem, <span class="italic">The Roman</span>. In 1848 Dobell and his wife moved to Coxhorne House, near Cheltenham, where he met two avid enthusiasts for the Italian nationalist movement, Sir James Stansfeld and George Davis, who introduced Dobell to the Society of the Friends of Italy  (Jolly, 1.195&#150;8). In April 1850, under the pseudonym Sydney Yendys, <span class="italic">The Roman</span> was published by Bentley. It revealed the interpretative power of the poet, the superiority of the intuition of the imagination over reason, and especially the use of associative metaphors to achieve epical unity. Particularly because the cause of Italian nationalism was such a stirring event of the time, the poem was enormously successful.<br>
<br>In 1853 Dobell published <span class="italic">Balder</span>. The poem was intended to be his master work in which he would demythologize a male-dominated culture, dramatize a divided consciousness, and invigorate epical poetry by metaphoric language which followed the untrammelled path of free association  (Westwater, 65). Instead, he infuriated critics. William Edmondstoune Aytoun lampooned the hero in his uproarious drama <span class="italic">Firmilian</span> (1854). Dobell was branded a &#145;Spasmodic&#146; poet, a title Aytoun coined to satirize poetry which he considered to be extravagant and formless. He objected to the lack of plot, the exploration of profane subjects, the sensationalism, and the unintelligibility of Dobell's <span class="italic">Balder, Part the First</span>. Aytoun effectively buried both the poem and Sydney Dobell's poetic reputation, and the poem has lain neglected. But despite all its problems, particularly that of its length, <span class="italic">Balder</span> has unusual modern merit in its treatment of nature (perhaps Dobell's greatest gift), in its mythopoeic emphasis, and in its psychological realism. For instance, where Balder, the extreme individualist, the arrogant, chauvinistic intellectual, has to confront his own darkness, his neglected, deranged wife cries:<blockquote>
<div>Oh yes, thy glory! Yes&#151;he must have glory,<br>
</div>
<div>Yes, he must have his glory; he can stand<br>
</div>
<div>All day in the sun, but he must have his glory!<br>
</div>
<div>He has walked up in the sunshine world,<br>
</div>
<div>He has been in the wind and the sweet rain,<br>
</div>
<div>And none cried &#145;Upset the cup o' the honey-time,<br>
</div>
<div>Upset the cup o' the honey-time&#146;. And I am empty and dry.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Dobell intended to redeem Balder in subsequent parts of the poem, but nothing was ever published. In 1854, seeking medical treatment for his wife, Dobell moved to Edinburgh. Here he befriended Alexander Smith, and in 1855 he collaborated with Smith, another victim of Aytoun's &#145;Spasmodic&#146; label, in a collection of poems on the Crimean War entitled <span class="italic">Sonnets on the War</span>. The book was not a success. Dobell recognized that he could never confine himself to the sonnet form which &#145;forbids anything like adequacy&#146;  (Jolly, 1.385). He wrote about seventeen of the thirty-five sonnets and showed how he could still master the startling image. In &#145;The Army Surgeon&#146;, for instance, the doctor goes about his duties on the battlefield where there &#145;bubbles a cauldron vast of many-coloured pain&#146;. In &#145;Austrian Alliance&#146; the speaker warns England of the Habsburg &#145;Vampyre&#146; who was wrenched<blockquote>
<div class="indent">from the breathing throat<br>
</div>
<div>Of living Man, and he leaps up and flings<br>
</div>
<div>Thy rotten carcase at the heads of Kings.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In the summer of 1856 Dobell published <span class="italic">England in Time of War</span>, a collection of his short lyrics on the Crimean War. Because critics had condemned him for obscurity, in this new book Dobell laboured for simplicity. He did not write on the extraordinary hero, but on people in every segment of society. He maintained that the book was &#145;a collection of about forty ballads, exponent of the Home feelings of England on the subject of the War&#146;  (Jolly, 2.15). The favourable reviews far outweighed the unfavourable ones, and &#145;Grass from the Battlefield&#146; was singled out as a poem &#145;which will be enshrined in memory along with the acknowledged masterpieces&#146; of modern poets  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 227). Certainly in this poem Dobell revealed an acute perception of the mind's ability to concentrate on something quite trivial when under unbearable pressure. The ballad &#145;Keith of Ravelston&#146; was another much praised poem.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1857 Dobell lectured before the Edinburgh Philosophical Society on &#145;The nature of poetry&#146;. Although his theory of poetry revealed an extraordinary knowledge of scripture, nevertheless the poet relied not so much on God and the future life in heaven, but on life itself and a spiritual presence in that life. In Dobell's view truth belonged to the individual and could be wrested only from the shadowy depths of one's own psyche. (The intensity of his struggle to face up to the demands of the distinctive self can be seen in his depiction both of the disillusioned Monk in <span class="italic">The Roman</span> and in the solipsistic hero of <span class="italic">Balder</span>.) Scriptural events, Dobell argued, should be reinterpreted on an individual basis; they were metaphors for survival tactics in an increasingly complex world. For Dobell metaphors were the symbolic &#145;equivalents&#146; of feelings; they reconcile the mind with the external world, the seen with the unseen; the metaphor was &#145;something more than a phenomenal similarity&#146;. His ideas anticipate those of I. A. Richards, who called on critics to discover what a poem &#145;expresses&#146; as well as what it states, and also T. S. Eliot's &#145;objective correlative&#146;. However, these ideas were entirely neglected at the time. Even John Nichol, Dobell's contemporary critic and friend, when preparing the lecture for publication, did little to elucidate the &#145;clearly conceived theory&#146;, or to give an &#145;honest study&#146; to the &#145;extraordinary view of poetry&#146; taken by &#145;this singularly thoughtful man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thoughts</span>, viin.). Modern critics however have found the lecture to be &#145;an impressive and significant document for the literary historian and theorist&#146;  (Preyer, 163), and &#145;one of the most sophisticated accounts of metaphor&#146;  (Armstrong, 11).<br>
<br>Dobell delivered his three-hour lecture on poetry while suffering from bronchitis. His already fragile constitution had been weakened by the strain placed on an overtaxed nervous system and the harsh climate of an Edinburgh winter. The Dobells returned to England and by 1858 settled at Detmore, where Sydney resumed the management of his father's wine business in Gloucestershire. Despite chronic illness Dobell did manage to publish some poetry in 1860, &#145;The Youth of England to Garibaldi's Legion&#146; and &#145;The Magyars' New Year's Eve&#146;, but neither created any sensation. In 1862 he began a series of nomadic wanderings, in search of better health, to France until 1863, Spain until 1864, and Italy until 1866. In April 1865, while stopping at Puteoli, Italy, where St Paul had landed, he fell into an old open drain and injured his spine and brain  (Jolly, 2.203); he was later treated for epilepsy. Although there was another trip to Italy in the following year, Sydney Dobell's health was broken. The next ten years were passed mostly in the pain and boredom of the sick-room in his homes in Gloucestershire. He died peacefully on 22 August 1874 at his last home, Barton End House, Horsley, near Nailsworth, and was buried in Painswick cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
