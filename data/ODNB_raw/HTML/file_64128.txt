<span class="headword">Parker,  George</span>, fourth earl of Macclesfield  (1755&#150;1842), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 24 February 1755, second child and eldest son of Thomas Parker, third earl of Macclesfield (1723&#150;1795), politician, of Shirburn Castle, Oxfordshire, and his wife and cousin, Mary (1726&#150;1812), daughter of Sir Thomas Heathcote, first baronet, of Hursley, Hampshire. Styled Viscount Parker from 1764, he was educated at Eton College (1765&#150;9), and at Exeter College, Oxford (1773&#150;6), to which he presented his portrait on leaving. He was returned to parliament for Woodstock, on 1 December 1777, on the Blenheim interest. He seconded the address on 25 November 1779. He married on 25 May 1780 Mary Frances (1761&#150;1823), daughter of the Revd Dr Thomas Drake of Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Whittington; in December he became a gentleman of the bedchamber to George, prince of Wales. He attended Westminster in February 1783, speaking on the 14th and voting for peace on the 18th. He found no seat at the general election in 1784, as he was haplessly associated with the prince's opposition to Pitt. The prince dismissed his household in 1786&#150;7, and Parker was dismissed again in 1789 after his father's support of Pitt over the regency. This martyrdom prompted him to write to Pitt, on 18 May 1790, requesting a Treasury board vacancy, preferably before he contested Sandwich at the general election in 1790. Defeated at Sandwich, he procured Minehead on the Luttrell interest, armed for the contest with a secret service subsidy.<br>
<br>Adhering to Pitt's ministry, Parker became comptroller of George III's household, and privy councillor, in April 1791. At Westminster he delivered royal messages. Succeeding his father as earl, and as high steward of Henley, on 9 February 1795, he took his seat in the Lords on 11 March, having informed Pitt of his wish to remain comptroller unless offered a better position. He was created DCL at Oxford, but demoted to lord of the bedchamber in April 1797, despite a plea to Pitt. He was appointed captain of Watlington yeoman cavalry in 1798, and on Pitt's return to power he became, from 1804 to 1830, captain of the yeomen of the guard. His general support for successive governments was silent. In June 1827 he offered the king his resignation when unable to support the <span class="roman">Corn Bill</span>, but was dissuaded. He also served as president of the board of agriculture (1816&#150;18), and his wife was lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte (1811&#150;18). He later eschewed publicity, and died at 9 Conduit Street, Hanover Square, London, on 20 March 1842, &#145;a good Conservative&#146;, lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire since 1817, FRS, and the second oldest privy councillor  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 548). He was buried at Shirburn on 29 March 1842. A son having died in infancy, he left one daughter, and his brother, Thomas, succeeded as earl.<br>
