<span class="headword">Woodward,  David Alfred</span>  (1942&#150;2004), <span class="occ">historian of cartography</span>, was born on 29 August 1942 at 51 Lillington Road, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the third child of Max Wakerley Woodward, Royal Navy chaplain, and his wife, Kathleen May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beaty. After returning from war service as a chaplain his father ministered in various London parishes, and David attended Harrow county grammar school and Sir John Cass College, London, before taking a degree in geography at University College, Swansea, in 1964. He continued his study of geography at the University of Wisconsin at Madison under the supervision of America's foremost academic cartographer, Arthur H. Robinson. He graduated MA in 1967 and received the degree of PhD from the university in 1970. He was appointed a cartographic consultant to the Newberry Library in Chicago in 1969 and became curator of its map collection, and then in 1974 director of the recently established Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography, a position he held for six years. In 1976 he became an American citizen, when Alfred was mistakenly dropped from his legal name. In 1980 he accepted Robinson's former cartography position in the geography department of the University of Wisconsin and was named Arthur H. Robinson professor of geography in 1995, a title he held until his retirement from the university in August 2002. On 27 July 1966 he was married by his father to Rosalind Lenice (Roz) Bailey (<i>b</i>. 1941), a nurse and daughter of Ronald Edwin Bailey, at Wesley Methodist Church, Queen's Road, Reading. They had three children, twin daughters, Jennifer and Rachel (who was killed in a railway accident in Italy in 1978), and a son, Justin.<br>
<br>Woodward's principal contributions to scholarship lay in the historical study of maps and map making. In close collaboration with his colleague and friend J. Brian Harley he transformed the study from a dominantly antiquarian and connoisseur pursuit focused on individual (overwhelmingly European) maps, and driven by a historiography of scientific progress, to a global history of cartography as the integrated academic study of the content, context, and impact of maps and mapping across all eras. Seeking to broaden the scope of map studies and bring them into conversation with the humanities more generally, Woodward remained deeply conscious of the map itself as a material object, in part through his fascination with the processes of map making. He was an elegant calligrapher, an accomplished printer with a press in his Madison house, a world expert on sixteenth-century Italian paper, inks, and watermarks, and a skilled curator of historical maps.<br>
<br>Woodward's unique combination of technical and scholarly concern with maps had been nurtured in Britain with part-time work as a cartographer at the Directorate of Overseas Survey and for <span class="italic">Reader's Digest</span>. As a graduate he produced an innovative shaded-relief map of Wisconsin (his Wisconsin cartography generated a groundbreaking cartographic portrait of the state's cultural geography in 1996 and a painting of its outline on the flank of a dairy cow in 1984). His interest in Italian Renaissance printed maps was initiated during a Guggenheim fellowship year in 1977&#150;8 and resulted in a catalogue of watermarks on sixteenth-century Italian printed maps (1996), detailed studies of the engraver Paolo Forlani, and other studies of Renaissance maps and map makers. Woodward's Panizzi lectures at the British Library in 1995 reinterpreted Italian Renaissance map making, distribution, and consumption. Interest in the map as both a technical and scientific artefact and a cultural expression generated Woodward's influential collection of invited essays <span class="italic">Art and Cartography</span> (1987). Here maps were taken as complex cultural products, best understood in the broadest historical context, as Woodward's own contribution&#151;on the typographic traditions of map lettering&#151;demonstrated.<br>
<br>It was this insight that underpinned Woodward's principal scholarly achievement, his editorial work on the multi-volume <span class="italic">History of Cartography</span>, publication of which began in 1987. Woodward had close links with the University of Chicago Press from his time at the Newberry Library, and he encouraged the publication of a series of important monographs on the cultural history of mapping. The first volume of the <span class="italic">History of Cartography</span>, jointly edited with Harley and devoted to &#145;Cartography in prehistoric, ancient and medieval Europe and the Mediterranean&#146;, was groundbreaking both conceptually and empirically. The editors' radical redefinition and extension of maps as &#145;graphic representations that facilitate a spatial understanding of things, concepts, conditions, processes, or events in the human world&#146;  (p. xvi) demolished conventional cartographic historiography. Woodward himself contributed a significant revisionist essay on the medieval <i>mappa mundi</i>, whose preparation initiated an important study of Roger Bacon's optics and mathematical projection in medieval Europe.<br>
<br>After Harley's death in 1991, Woodward took on the tasks of funding, managing, and editing the <span class="italic">History of Cartography</span> project himself, personally editing the 62-chapter volume on the European Renaissance (published posthumously in 2007). The task was undertaken with characteristic understatement of his own knowledge and ability, and with gentle good humour and intellectual generosity. Shy by nature, Woodward none the less left a lasting impression on those he met, taught, and worked with as a thoughtful listener and a generous host, who loved Italian wine and whose passions ranged from the Palatino font to flying small aircraft. His death from cancer, at home in Madison, Wisconsin, on 25 August 2004, prompted a global correspondence of appreciation, celebrating friendship and scholarship. Appropriately the distribution of his ashes mapped four loved places in Wisconsin and Wales. He was survived by his wife, Roz, and two of their three children.<br>
