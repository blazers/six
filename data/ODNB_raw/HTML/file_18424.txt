<div class="para">
<span class="headword">May,  Thomas Erskine</span>, Baron Farnborough  (1815&#150;1886), <span class="occ">clerk of the House of Commons</span>, was born in Kentish Town, London, on 8 February 1815, the son (according to the baptismal record) of Thomas May, attorney, and his wife, Sarah. A connection with the former lord chancellor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8873/', "Thomas Erskine")</script>, however, was accepted by part of Erskine's family, claimed by one of May's relatives, and hinted at by May himself, and rumours long persisted in the clerk's department. Its precise nature has not been established. May had three sisters (or half-sisters). After a private education as a pupil of Dr Brereton, headmaster of Bedford School, May was offered an Oxford exhibition, which his diary, without explanation, records his inability to accept. He was called to the bar, from the Middle Temple, in 1838.<br>
<br>Instead, in 1831, May became assistant to Thomas Vardon, librarian of the House of Commons. In that post May laid the foundations of his wide procedural knowledge by re-indexing the Commons <span class="italic">Journals</span>. He married (on 27 August 1839) Louisa Johanna, daughter of George Laughton of Fareham: there were no children. For most of his life May lived in an official residence in the Palace of Westminster or in Chester Square, Belgravia. In 1847, at the height of parliamentary activity on railway bills, he was appointed one of the first examiners of petitions for private bills in an effort to devolve to officials the troublesome proof of compliance with standing orders, previously the concern of committees of members. Speaker Shaw Lefevre described the office as &#145;by far the most laborious duty about the House&#146;. The speaker pressed May's claim to the clerkship in 1850, but pressure from the prime minister (Russell) secured the appointment for Sir Denis Le Marchant. May had to wait until 1856 before becoming clerk assistant, and it was not until May 1871, having supported the ill-suited Le Marchant for fifteen years, that May became clerk.<br>
<br>May received contemporary, including prime ministerial, acclaim for his published works on constitutional history, notably <span class="italic">The Constitutional History of England since the Accession of George III</span> (2 vols., 1861&#150;3) and <span class="italic">Democracy in Europe: a History</span> (2 vols., 1877). But it is his contribution to the modernizing of the Victorian House of Commons which has better stood the test of time. Even before 1832 successive governments had laid increasing claim to the time of the house for their legislative and financial business. The procedural forms devised to accommodate this had to avoid damaging the ability of private members to criticize and control the executive. The most prolific source of solutions was May. His approach was one of whiggish caution. Obsolete forms were rarely without mischief, but what replaced leisurely and elaborate procedures had to respect the dignity and merit of old custom. In advice to successive speakers, in evidence to select committees (not all of which were anxious to take up the challenge), and in published articles May's fertile procedural imagination shaped the house's new practice: rules for questions to ministers were elaborated; relevance in debate was insisted on; the number of potential divisions, particularly on legislation, was drastically pruned. In order to make best use of limited time available on the floor of the house, it was essential to devise procedures for handling business which could sensibly be remitted to smaller bodies. During his career May put forward a number of solutions to this particular problem, though the preferred option, standing committees, was not originally his idea. His later years were devoted to devising schemes to enhance the powers of the chair in the face of growing unruliness, and to permit the majority to bring the house to a decision, despite the objections of the minority. Early in 1882 May twice attended the cabinet, to advise it on procedure.<br>
<br>These developments were recorded in May's <span class="italic">Parliamentary Practice</span>, first published in 1844 when May was aged twenty-nine and not yet a clerk. He admitted to intending a straightforward account of parliament, though he was aware of the commercial possibilities of meeting the more detailed needs of those interested in railways bills. The work was an instant success, hailed by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;a popular work &hellip; compact and compendious&#146;. May edited a further eight editions, as the work deepened into an authoritative guide to procedure which, in succeeding generations, has helped to shape the development of Westminster practice, perpetuating its editor's name. At a very early stage in its career, <span class="italic">Parliamentary Practice</span> was used overseas. In 1851 the speaker of the New South Wales legislative council told May that it was &#145;quite impossible &hellip; to overrate the advantages which have resulted from the employment of your work in the colonial legislatures&#146;. The text was translated for the perhaps more problematical benefit of two German diets and the Hungarian parliament. There were also French, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese versions.<br>
<br>With the increasing complexity of Commons procedures went the need for professional development in May's department. For all his personal ability May was ambivalent about such a change. The principle that men were promoted to the table of the house, in effect as May's successors, on merit and experience alone was enunciated by Speaker Denison and not by May. Entrance to the department depended on the clerk's nomination, and May used his powers in the interests of the sons of men already in the service of the house, of predominantly Liberal politicians, and of court officials. He resisted even limited competition for nominations. As a result, while socially, and to some extent educationally, the background of clerks changed, May's attitude delayed the development of the service of the house. Even the clerkship itself, on May's retirement, was first offered to men without departmental experience. None of these limited perspectives, however, impairs May's position as the man whose tireless professionalism at a time of political and procedural change shaped the modern clerk's department.<br>
<br>May's diaries bear witness to the relatively humourless ambition and hard work of their author. The impression is relieved only by a story told by Speaker Gully that as a good-looking flirtatious young man May compromised himself with a married lady and had to fight a duel with her husband at Boulogne. His preferment owed much to energy and ability, but these were assisted by the ease with which May moved in Liberal political society. Usually when promotion offered, the Liberals were conveniently in power. When in 1875 and 1885 May considered the possibility of becoming clerk of the parliaments in the Lords, they were not in power, and his ambition went unrealized. At the same time, neither May nor his department was drawn into any spoils system. In 1883 the retiring speaker, Brand, wrote to May of his legacy to the man who was to succeed him in the chair: &#145;the sum and substance of my advice to Peel will be to trust you and the house&#146;.<br>
<br>May was created CB in 1860 and KCB in 1866 (after some discreet agitation), and became a privy councillor in August 1885. The last was an unusual, though not unique, honour for a serving official. He retired in April 1886 and on 11 May 1886 was created Baron Farnborough. He died at Speaker's Court in the Palace of Westminster on 17 May 1886 and was buried at Chippenham, Cambridgeshire.<br>
