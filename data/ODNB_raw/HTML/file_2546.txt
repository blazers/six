<span class="headword">Blackwood,  George Frederick</span>  (1838&#150;1880), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Major William Blackwood of the Bengal army, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2550/', "William Blackwood")</script>, founder of the publishing firm. He was born at Moradabad, Bengal, was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and at Addiscombe College, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Bengal artillery on 11 December 1857. He arrived in India during the Indian mutiny, and was at once appointed to command two guns in Colonel Wilkinson's Rohilkhand column. He was promoted first lieutenant on 27 August 1858, and was adjutant first to the Bareilly and Gwalior divisions and then to the 22nd and 19th brigades of Royal Artillery from 1859 to 1864.<br>
<br>Blackwood was promoted captain on 20 February 1867, and in 1872 was appointed to command the artillery attached to General Bourchier's column in the Lushai expedition. He was present at the attacks on Tipai-Mukh, Kungnung, and Taikum. His services were specially mentioned in the general's dispatch of 19 March 1872, and he was promoted brevet major on 11 September. He gave further evidence of his ability as an artillery officer by his able report on the use of guns in such country as that in which he had recently served, with views on the best calibre for mountain guns, which was printed by the Indian government and circulated among its officers. Blackwood was promoted major on 10 February 1875, and after temporarily commanding a battery of Royal Horse Artillery came to England on sick leave. He thus missed the first Afghan campaign of 1878&#150;9, but was in India when, on the news of Cavagnari's death, it was determined to once more occupy both Kabul and Kandahar.<br>
<br>Blackwood was posted to the command of E battery B brigade of Royal Horse Artillery, and ordered to join the force destined for Kandahar. While stationed there the news arrived of the advance of Ayub Khan, and a column was ordered out under the command of Brigadier-General Burrows to assist the wali placed in command by Abdur Rahman Khan and to investigate the strength of the enemy. To that column Blackwood's battery was attached; the column was cut to pieces at the battle of Maiwand on 27 July 1880, where Blackwood was killed and buried in the field, and two of his guns lost. They were subsequently recovered after Ayub's defeat on 1 September 1880, and were presented to Roberts by the government.<br>
