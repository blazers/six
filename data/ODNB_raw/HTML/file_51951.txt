<span class="headword">Monteith,  Robert</span>  (1811&#150;1884), <span class="occ">politician and philanthropist</span>, was born in Glasgow on 23 December 1811, one of fourteen children, but the only surviving son, of the marriage between <a name="cosubject_57540"></a><span class="headword">Henry Monteith</span>  (1765&#150;1848) and Christina Cameron (1768&#150;1818). Henry Monteith was a <span class="occ">merchant landowner</span>, twice lord provost of Glasgow (1814&#150;16 and 1818&#150;20), and an MP; he owned huge textile mills at Barrowfield, Glasgow, and at Blantyre, and made his fortune with the Turkey-red dye process. His home, Carstairs House (built in 1818), was one of the first neo-Gothic buildings in Scotland. In 1820 he defeated Robert Owen for the Lanark burghs parliamentary seat. Briefly MP for Saltash in 1826, he was returned again for Lanark burghs in 1830, holding the seat until 1832.<br>
<br>Robert Monteith, after studying at Glasgow University, proceeded, with his cousin Francis G. Garden, to Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1829. A member of the Apostles, he became a close friend of Richard Monckton Milnes (later Lord Houghton), Alfred Tennyson, John Sterling, Henry Hallam, Richard Chenevix Trench, A. J. C. Hare, William Palgrave, and many others. He was acquainted with W. E. Gladstone, W. M. Thackeray, Coventry Patmore, and Fran&ccedil;ois Rio, the French art critic, and shared in many literary and artistic endeavours, such as the 1839 Eglinton tournament, the restoration of Glasgow Cathedral, and the Burns and Scott memorials in Edinburgh. His hospitality was always lavish. He was prevented from going to support the Spanish liberal cause in 1830, but he travelled the continent and visited Rome in the 1830s: he passed many winters there in Catholic aristocratic circles in the 1850s. After unsuccessful attempts to win a seat in Glasgow in the tory interest twice in 1837, he refused to stand later on at least two occasions. He unsuccessfully contested Bewdley in 1841. In 1844, at Morden parish church, Monteith married Wilhelmina Catherine Anne (<i>d</i>. 1884), the third daughter of Joseph Charles Mellish, a former consul-general at Hamburg and translator of Schiller's <span class="italic">Mary Queen of Scots</span> (1801). They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Various influences encouraged the development of Monteith's social Romanticism: Kenelm Digby; his association with French liberal Catholicism; Bishop Gillis's mutual improvement and benefit society; the Holy Guild of St Joseph, Edinburgh; Catholic notions of international law; and the patient suffering of the Irish workers in his textile mills. In the debates over the established churches of Scotland and England, he fell under Romantic rather than rational German influences. He consulted John Henry Newman at Littlemore, who received him into the Roman Catholic church in 1846. His wife followed shortly afterwards. His godfather was Ignatius Spencer, an earlier convert and Passionist priest. Monteith came deeply under the influence of David Urquhart, the renowned Russophobe, whose Glasgow visit in 1838 made Monteith a close supporter. Urquhart and Monteith believed that Russia had infiltrated the British government, fomented unrest among workers, and destroyed their sense of community: they argued that a just international order would bring domestic peace. Monteith championed the poor. He attended the great Birmingham Chartist gathering of 1840, and worked with Chartists such as Robert Lowery and William Cardo to prevent an Anglo-French war in 1841. If poverty horrified him, pauperism, or state-induced dependence, he believed to be worse. He and Urquhart pressed their views on Catholic clergy and Oxford scholars: they hoped to establish a chair of international law at Oxford. From the 1850s Monteith supported Urquhart's working men's foreign affairs committees and newspaper, the <span class="italic">Free Press</span>, to which Karl Marx was a contributor. With Thomas Chisholm Anstey MP, and Urquhart, he campaigned against Russian expansion, British imperialism, and the despoiling of the highlands. He promoted savings banks for workers. With Urquhart he supported the introduction of Turkish baths into Britain for social harmony and health: he addressed the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science on the subject in 1874. He also patented several early forms of refrigeration for foodstuffs. A peace advocate, if not a pacifist, to his death, he bitterly opposed the military conscription common in continental states in the nineteenth century. His campaign for the reassertion of the law of nations at the Vatican Council of 1870&#150;71 was a logical development of his view that conscription encouraged war as a regular arm of policy. Using a variety of influences&#151;the <span class="italic">Diplomatic Review</span>, Bishop Mermillod of Geneva, the French sociologist Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Le Play, a visit to Turkey to win over the Armenian bishops, and, not least, lavish Roman hospitality&#151;he won the attention of the pope, and the issue reached the council. In a similar vein, Monteith led a delegation of working men to the French national assembly in 1873 to promote social peace and international harmony. He also showed great interest in the Italian Don Bosco and his work with poor boys.<br>
<br>Prominent in the Scottish Catholic revival, Monteith was a member of the Catholic Poor Schools Committee and the Catholic Defence Association, which worked against the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Act</span> of 1850. He had earlier established the Association of St Margaret (1848) to bind together the aristocratic, convert, and Irish elements in Scottish Catholicism in order to support Catholic legal defences, education, vocations, and the poorer parishes of Scotland. He saw congregational singing as part of his schemes for social unity and composed hymns to promote this aim. He brought some 10 tons of religious statues to Scotland, and encouraged and financially supported the return of religious orders: Franciscan and Good Shepherd nuns, Jesuits, Passionists, and, unsuccessfully, Christian Brothers. His financial backing was important in many endeavours: he was largely responsible for St Mary's, Lanark, and the Smyllum orphanage and hospital. His influence was significant in a poverty-stricken church: Rome found it useful in the bitter public clash between Scottish and Irish Catholics in the 1860s.<br>
<br>The ill health of his wife and his own decline meant that Monteith was less active in his last years, wintering in France. He died at his home, Carstairs House, Lanarkshire, on 31 March 1884, having played an important, if idiosyncratic, role in the revival of Roman Catholicism in Scotland. His wife died within days of him.<br>
