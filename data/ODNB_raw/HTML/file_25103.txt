<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Serres,  Dominic</span>  (1722&#150;1793), <span class="occ">marine painter</span>, was born at Auch in Gascony, France, and was educated at the famous Benedictine school at Douai. He is said to have been nephew of the archbishop of Rheims. His parents intended him for the church, but he ran away from his native town, and made his way on foot into Spain. He there shipped on board a vessel for South America as a common sailor, and eventually became master of a trading vessel to Havana, Cuba, where he was taken prisoner by a British frigate and brought to England in the 1750s. After his release he married and lived for a time in Northamptonshire before moving to London. There he met the gifted marine artist Charles Brooking and was much influenced by his work. He shows the same concern for light and shadow on the surface of the water and his drawing of waves is never stereotyped.<br>
<br>In 1765 Serres became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, with which he exhibited for two years. On the establishment of the Royal Academy in 1768 he was chosen one of the foundation members, and was a constant contributor up to the time of his death [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. Between 1761 and 1793 he exhibited eight works at the Society of Artists, twenty-one at the Free Society, and 105 at the Royal Academy. Redgrave noted that Serres spoke English with fluency, was a good Latin and Italian scholar, and also spoke Spanish and Portuguese. These accomplishments, together with his competence as a painter and his undoubted charm, secured him royal favour and numerous commissions. In 1784 his friend and neighbour Paul Sandby wrote: &#145;But Dom is grown a very great man, has been to Paris, dined with the King's architect and is going to paint the Grand Monarque&#146;  (Sandby, 167). In 1792 he succeeded Joseph Wilton as librarian to the academy. He was also appointed marine painter to George III, but he did not long hold these offices.<br>
<br>Serres died on 6 November 1793, and was buried at St Marylebone Old Church. He had two sons, who followed his profession, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25104/', "John Thomas Serres")</script> and Dominic, and four daughters, two of whom were honorary exhibitors at the Royal Academy. A miniature portrait of the artist by Philip Jean (National Portrait Gallery, London) shows the artist in his sixties, seated at his easel and putting the finishing touches to a painting of ships.<br>
<br>Forty-five paintings by Serres in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, include a fine ship portrait <span class="italic">HMS Royal George in the English Channel</span>, numerous sea battles, and a series of eleven paintings illustrating the capture of Havana in 1762 based on information and sketches supplied by Lieutenant Durnsford, who served in the campaign. Engravings of the series were published by Durnsford during 1764&#150;5. Other paintings and drawings are in the Royal Collection and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
