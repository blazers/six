<span class="headword">Hawkins,  Benjamin Waterhouse</span>  (1807&#150;1894), <span class="occ">natural history artist and sculptor</span>, was born on 8 February 1807 in Devonshire Street, London, the son of Thomas Hawkins (1777/8&#150;1811), artist, and his wife, Louisa Anna (<i>b</i>. 1781/2), daughter of William Waterhouse, plantation owner in Jamaica. Educated at St Aloysius College, he studied sculpture under William Behnes. On 4 July 1826 he married, at St John's, Hampstead, Mary Selina (1804&#150;1880), daughter of Thomas William Green; they had four daughters and a son. On 23 April 1836, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, he bigamously married Frances Louisa (1811&#150;1884), daughter of John Keenan, artist; they had two daughters. He remarried her, in a civil ceremony, on 17 May 1883. His second wife was a portrait painter who exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1839 and 1868.<br>
<br>Hawkins (who styled himself Waterhouse Hawkins or B. Waterhouse Hawkins) specialized in natural history subjects and displayed a number of paintings of animals at the Royal Academy, the British Institution, and elsewhere from 1832 to 1849. He had access to the collections of the Zoological Society of London, the Hunterian Museum of Comparative Anatomy, and the Natural History department of the British Museum. His earliest known scientific commission was to prepare the plates for <span class="italic">Illustrations of Indian Zoology</span> (1830&#150;35), edited by John Edward Gray. He contributed forty-nine plates, illustrating fish and reptiles, to Charles Darwin's <span class="italic">The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle</span> (pts 4 and 5, 1838&#150;43). In 1842&#150;7 he produced a series of studies of living animals from the menagerie of the earl of Derby at Knowsley. He was also responsible for the plates of birds and animals for <span class="italic">The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Sulphur</span> (1843&#150;4), edited by Richard Brinsley Hinds, and for <span class="italic">Graphic Illustrations of Animals Showing their Utility to Man</span>, published by Thomas Varty about 1845. Elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1847, a member of the Society of Arts in 1848, and a fellow of the Geological Society in 1854, he was an assistant superintendent and exhibitor at the 1851 Great Exhibition.<br>
<br>In September 1852 Hawkins was appointed director of the fossil department of the Crystal Palace, under reconstruction at Sydenham, south London, and in collaboration with Richard Owen began to construct the first major public display of the progression of life on earth, comprising life-sized iron and stone models of fourteen genera of extinct animals, together with reconstructions of fossil plants and geological strata. He held a dinner party on 31 December 1853 in the mould of the largest model, of the dinosaur <i>Iguanodon</i>. The Crystal Palace work was terminated in the summer of 1855, with the display incomplete, but it made a significant contribution to popular understanding of the nature of the development of life on earth and now provides an important insight into palaeontological knowledge in the mid-1850s.<br>
<br>Hawkins next undertook a variety of freelance commissions including animal sculptures for the gardens of James Bateman at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire (1859&#150;62), educational wall charts for the Department of Science and Art, drawings of ape and human skeletons for the frontispiece to T. H. Huxley's <span class="italic">Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</span> (1863), works on the artistic anatomy of the horse (1865), cattle and sheep (1867), and the dog and deer (1868), as well as contributions to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Society of Arts</span> on techniques of art reproduction. He also gave popular lectures on natural history.<br>
<br>Hawkins travelled to the United States in 1868 and was commissioned to create a similar display of models of extinct animals in Central Park, New York. He travelled to Philadelphia to work on the latest fossil discoveries at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, where he moulded fossil bones of the dinosaur <i>Hadrosaurus foulkii</i> to create a mounted facsimile for display. This was &#145;the first fully articulated dinosaur skeleton display in the world&#146;  (Bramwell and Peck, 79), and on being put on display in Philadelphia in November 1868 it attracted nearly 100,000 visitors. By early 1871 he had completed numerous moulds and some finished models. The New York project was abandoned, however, following the destruction of the work in May 1871 on the orders of a new, corrupt, city administration. He then undertook lecture tours in the USA, promoting anti-Darwinian views. In 1873 the geologist Arnold Guyot arranged for him to lecture at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), which awarded him an honorary degree in June 1874. After visiting Britain he returned to the USA early in 1875 and began a series of seventeen oil paintings of prehistoric scenes, based on fossil evidence, for display at Princeton. A further mould of the hadrosaurus was created for the American Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1875, and in 1879 was transferred to the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Hawkins returned to Britain permanently in April 1879, and lived in relative obscurity, his membership of learned societies having lapsed. For the last five years of his life he suffered from the effects of a stroke. He died from a combination of that and gangrene of the feet, at 60 Erpingham Road, Putney, London, on 27 January 1894 and was buried at Putney Lower Common cemetery. His dinosaur models at Crystal Palace were restored in 2002.<br>
