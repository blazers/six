<span class="headword">Percy,  William  de</span>  (1191<span class="mult">x</span>3&#150;1245), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the eldest son of Henry de Percy (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1198) and Isabel de Brus, daughter of Adam de Brus and Juetta d'Arches. He had a younger brother, Henry. From at least 1200 his guardian was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3369/', "William Brewer")</script>, a royal favourite. He came of age between 1212 and 1214, whereupon he gained control of the honour of Petworth, which his father, Henry, had inherited from his own father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47211/', "Joscelin de Louvain")</script>, the younger son of Godefroi, duke of Lower Lorraine, and brother of Henry I's second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/165/', "Queen Adeliza")</script>. He should also have inherited the Percy estates, which had been divided between his paternal grandmother, Agnes, and her sister Matilda, who died without heirs, but because of a legal technicality he had to share these lands with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21952/', "Richard de Percy")</script> until the latter's death in 1244; this division of lands created a large amount of litigation in the meantime.<br>
<br>In 1214 William de Percy participated in King John's expedition to Poitou. He was later listed by Matthew Paris as one of the followers of the twenty-five barons of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, but there is no other evidence that he supported the rebel cause. He was certainly a supporter of the king in the civil war that broke out following the king's repudiation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, for in May 1216 King John granted him the lands of his uncle Richard, a prominent rebel and one of the twenty-five barons, and of other rebels, although these grants were revoked when peace was made early in Henry III's reign. Percy served Henry III in the campaign against William, count of Aumale, in 1221 and participated in later campaigns as well, although he paid &pound;100 to avoid the Poitevin campaign of 1242. He was a generous benefactor to the church, for he gave the manor and forest of Gisburn to Sallay Abbey and made gifts to the hospital of Sandon, the nunnery at Stainfield, Coverham Abbey, Shulbrede Priory, and Healaugh Park Priory.<br>
<br>Percy married first Joan, one of the five daughters of his guardian, William Brewer. They had five daughters of their own who in 1233 (their mother having died) inherited one fifth of the Brewer estates after the death of William Brewer the younger. Percy's second wife, who survived him, was Elena, the daughter of Ingram de Balliol. They had at least six sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21927/', "Henry de Percy")</script>, William, Walter, Ingram, Alan, and Joscelin; a seventh son, Geoffrey, is mentioned in later genealogies. Percy died not long before 28 July 1245. His body was buried at Sallay Abbey in Yorkshire but his heart was buried with his first wife, Joan, at the hospital of Sandon in Sussex.<br>
