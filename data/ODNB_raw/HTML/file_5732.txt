<span class="headword">Cobb,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1675, <em>d.</em> 1713), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, was baptized on 17 October 1675. His father, Samuel Cobb, a cooper and citizen of London, died before April 1683, when the former lord mayor John Moore sponsored the boy, then of St Andrew's, Holborn, for admission to Christ's Hospital, London. Among the &#145;blue-coat boys&#146; Cobb advanced to Grecian. Upon his discharge on 27 February 1694 Christ's Hospital sent him and one classmate for advanced education, providing &pound;12 toward his BA (1698) and &pound;15 toward his MA (1702) at Trinity College, Cambridge. Cobb gave his tripos speech on 19 February 1702; on 11 March he became &#145;under grammar master&#146; of Christ's Hospital. He was granted residence in 1704, and although school records report him &#145;often disguised with strong liquors&#146;, he kept his place until his death.<br>
<br>Cobb's earliest experience with the London literary establishment was unpropitious. While still a pupil at Christ's Hospital he wrote <span class="italic">A Pindarique Ode &hellip; [in] Memory of &hellip; Queen Mary</span> (1694), only to see it printed as if &#145;written by J. D. Gent&#146;. In his thoroughly entitled <span class="italic">Bersaba, or, The love of David &hellip; written by Samuel Cobb, student of Trinity College, Cambridge</span> (1695), he protested that &#145;the Ode was snatch'd from me &hellip; abruptly and unfortunately&#146;. Readers acquiesced: &#145;J. D. Gent proves only Blue-Coat C[obb]&#146;  (H. MacDonald, <span class="italic">John Dryden: a Bibliography</span>, 1939, 183). Continuing to aim appropriate sentiments in the proper direction, without approaching Dryden's success, Cobb churned out <span class="italic">Pax redux &hellip; on the Return of His Majesty and the Happy Conclusion of the Peace</span> (1697), <span class="italic">The Portugal Expedition</span> (1704), <span class="italic">Honour Retriev'd &hellip; [re] Victories Obtain'd over the French and Bavarians</span> (1705), and the like. The same year that Dryden died, however, Cobb published a work with implications beyond the occasions of his truncated lifetime. <span class="italic">Poetae Britannici: a Poem, Satyrical and Panegyrical</span> (1700) surveys English literary history, emphasizing &#145;simplicity of style and beauty of content&#146; in ways that anticipate mid-century developments of visual and sublime effects in poetry  (E. Rothstein, <span class="italic">Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Poetry</span>, 1981, 183).<br>
<br>Cobb's work gained further respect with the publication in 1780&#150;82 of John Nichols's <span class="italic">Select Collection of Poems</span>, which included seven poems by Cobb  (7.238&#150;66). Nichols further acclaimed <span class="italic">The female reign: an ode, alluding to Horace, B. 4. od. 14 &hellip; attempted in the style of Pindar, occasion'd by the wonderful successes of the arms of her majesty and her allies</span> (1709), recommending that Robert Dodsley republish it as adapted by Isaac Watts  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 23, 1753, 282&#150;5) rather than as admired by Joseph Warton (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1812&#150;16, 6.170; R. Dodsley, ed., <span class="italic">A Collection of Poems</span>, 4 vols., 1748&#150;9, 1.69&#150;81).<br>
<br>Despite scholars' appreciation for that ode's Greek-derived verse form and Roman theme applied to current events, the book-buying public preferred two less scholarly items. In 1712 Cobb published both his modernization of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Miller's Tale</span> and his translation of Edward Holdsworth's <span class="italic">Muscipula</span> (1708), a Latin mock-heroic that inspired frequent reprints and ten other translations. Cobb's <span class="italic">Mouse-Trap</span> was separately published five times, and included in John Torbuck's <span class="italic">Collection of Welsh Travels</span> (1738). The only rival to Cobb's <span class="italic">Miller's Tale</span> was never reprinted, whereas Cobb's version reappeared at least eleven times in miscellanies and collections including <span class="italic">The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, Modernis'd by Several Hands</span>  (ed. G. Ogle, 3 vols., 1741). Only the equally bawdy <span class="italic">Reeve's Tale</span> modernized by Thomas Betterton (pseudonym for Alexander Pope) rivalled Cobb's <span class="italic">Miller's Tale</span> in frequency of republication. Thus, because few readers before 1775 overcame the barriers of Middle English editions, Cobb shares responsibility for the prevalent eighteenth-century impression of Chaucer as &#145;a comic poet chiefly remarkable for the scurrility of his verses&#146;  (C. Spurgeon, <span class="italic">Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism</span>, 3 vols., 1925, 1.liii).<br>
<br>An anecdote and two published letters allow glimpses of Cobb's personality. His Cambridge professor Richard Bentley &#145;found his criticisms upon a Greek exercise, which Cobb had presented, refuted one after another by Pindar's authority, [whereupon Bentley] cried out at last, &#147;Pindar was a bold fellow, but thou art an impudent one&#148;&#146;  (S. Johnson, <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span>, ed. G. B. Hill, 3 vols., 1905, 3.227). Audacity would seem to echo in Cobb's <span class="italic">Discourse on Criticism and the Liberty of Writing</span>, prefacing <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1707) and addressed to his former classmate Richard Carter at his home in Barbados. With enthusiasm Cobb writes of &#145;secret Springs of the Soul, and those sudden Emotions, which excite illustrious Men, to act and speak out of the Common Road&#146;, and with cynicism of a war that has produced only &#145;What battles generally do; bad Poets, and worse Criticks&#146;. Rushing for the mail ship, Cobb closes by promising Carter &#145;the rest on the Pindaric Style&#146;. He published the rest with <span class="italic">The Female Reign</span>, addressing &#145;a gentleman in the University&#146; and shrugging, &#145;Whether you will call the following lines a Pindaric ode, or irregular stanzas, gives me no disturbance&#146;. Such comments accord with contemporary appreciation for Cobb's &#145;sound Learning, ready Wit, and good Humour&#146;, so described by Giles Jacob, who singles out <span class="italic">Clavis Virgiliana, or, New Observations upon the Works of Virgil</span> (1714).<br>
<br>Cobb's other posthumous publication likewise documents esteem both for his learning and wit. <span class="italic">News from both Universities</span> (1714) preserves his 1702 tripos speech, plus a Latin mock-heroic with English translation dated four months after his death. Perhaps its author was his friend from Barbados, for a Richard Carter was writing life insurance pamphlets in London between 1711 and 1715. Cobb, though, had many literary contacts. With John Ozell, Nicholas Rowe, and others he collaborated to translate from Greek <span class="italic">The Works of Lucian</span> (4 vols., 1710&#150;11); from French <span class="italic">Boileau's Lutrin</span> (1708), and <span class="italic">The Works of Monsieur Boileau</span> (3 vols., 1711&#150;13); and from seventeenth-century Latin the <span class="italic">Callipaedia</span> (1710) of Claude Quillet, whose writings on &#145;Eudoxus&#146; and &#145;Gassendus&#146; Cobb alone translated (both 1712).<br>
<br>School responsibilities motivated other works. For Christ's Hospital Cobb translated <span class="italic">A Synopsis of Algebra</span> (1709) from the Latin of Joannes Alexander of Bern. He composed lyrics to John Barrett's music for every extant Easter anthem during his years in residence. He also wrote &#145;The Oak and the Briar&#146; published in <span class="italic">English Gratitude, or, The Whig Miscellany</span> (1713), and translated Robert Freind's Latin epitaph for the Westminster Abbey monument to Philip Carteret  (J. Crull, <span class="italic">Antiquities of St Peter's</span>, 3rd edn, 2 vols., 1722, 2.101&#150;2).<br>
<br>Cobb died, unmarried, at Christ's Hospital on 18 September 1713, and was buried in the cloisters.<br>
