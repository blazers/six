<span class="headword">Mason,  Martin</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1655&#150;1676), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was probably the son of John Mason (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1675), &#145;gentleman&#146;, of St Swithin's, Lincoln. Mason's knowledge of Latin suggests a grammar school education. By 1655 he had become a Quaker, possibly &#145;convinced&#146; during the visits of George Fox and William Dewsbury to Lincoln the previous year. Mason's first books were published in 1655. <span class="italic">A Check to the Loftie Linguist</span> refuted the assertions made by George Scortreth, a preacher at Lincoln Cathedral, in a debate with the town's sheriff, Robert Craven, whom Fox had convinced in 1654. Mason's other 1655 publication, <span class="italic">The Proud Pharisee Reproved</span>, attacked the Independent Edward Reyner's <span class="italic">Precepts for Christian Practice</span> (8th edn, 1655); Reyner, too, was a preacher at Lincoln Cathedral. Mason challenged the Baptist Jonathan Johnson in a letter (apparently lost), and then replied to his response in <span class="italic">The Boasting Baptist Dismounted</span> (1656). When Johnson renewed the debate in <span class="italic">The Quaker Quasht</span> (1659), Mason answered in <span class="italic">Sion's Enemy Discovered</span> (n.d. [1659]), arguing in part for the Friends' conception of the Christ who suffers within believers, enabling them to experience an unquenchable fire.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Mason contributed to the chorus of Quaker advice to King Charles and parliament in two broadsides, <span class="italic">Charles, the King of England, the Infinite Being</span> (1660) and <span class="italic">To both Houses of Parliament</span> (2 November 1660), calling for religious toleration. In <span class="italic">A Faithful Warning, with Good Advice</span> (7 January [1661]), he protested against incarcerating the innocent, the conspiracy of priests and people against God's annointed, and charges that Quakers were plotters. England's rulers, he argued, should be nursing fathers to Zion, and should bury revenge in &#145;the grave of Eternal forgetfulness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Faithful Warning</span>, 6). By 2 February he was in the Lincoln town prison, where he composed <span class="italic">A Loving Invitation, and a Faithful Warning to All People</span>, complaining that innocency was now a crime and warning of imminent divine vengeance. Reflecting the Quakers' belief in the pre-eminence of spirit over word, he averred that recourse to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> could not save England; 10,000 bibles were nothing without Christ's presence. Dutch and German translations of the tract appeared the same year. From his prison cell he issued another work on 18 February, <span class="italic">Innocence Cleared</span>, defending the Friends' right to meet for worship, denouncing oaths, and espousing a view of government limited to preserving peace and curtailing wickedness. When the validity of a Quaker marriage was challenged in Nottinghamshire (<i>Ashwell v. Theaker</i>) Mason wrote to two judges of assize on 2 August 1661, arguing that refusal to recognize Quaker matrimony would undermine religion, make Quakers fornicators, and bastardize their children; the verdict upheld Quaker marriage. Mason joined John Whitehead in September 1662 in an appeal to bishops to reform themselves, their clergy and ecclesiastical courts, their parishioners, and their worship; restrained in tone, <span class="italic">An Expostulation with the Bishops</span> politely explained why Friends could not in good conscience belong to the Church of England. Two months later, writing against the background of Charles's proposed indulgence, Mason addressed <span class="italic">A Friendly Admonition</span> to Catholics, urging them to repudiate compulsion as an instrument of religion.<br>
<br>Imprisoned again by 20 March 1665, Mason published meditations entitled <span class="italic">One Mite More Cast into God's Treasury</span> (1665), condemning professional clergy and persecutors, and depicting Quakers as a handful of harmless people. Increasingly attracted to poetry, Mason completed a broadside in verse on 1 May 1665, <span class="italic">Love and Good-Will to All</span>, cautioning his adversaries that they strove against God, not the Friends. Physically ill, he consulted with the German physician Albertus Otto Faber in 1666&#150;8, obtaining relief. By April 1669 he was again in the Lincoln prison; he was released by the royal pardon of September 1672. Among his fellow Quaker correspondents were Rebecca Travers (February 1671) and John Pennyman (April 1669). Mason's last published work was a tribute in verse to John Perrot, written on 17 October 1676 and printed on the back of the title-page of <span class="italic">The Vision of John Perrot</span> (1682). Perrot had challenged Fox's authority by claiming to have had a divine revelation against men removing their hats during prayer; for this, Fox accused him of destroying Quaker unity. Mason admired Perrot, and, like George Whitehead, espoused a moderate position on wearing hats during prayer, deeming the issue inconsequential. Mason saluted the spiritual power in Perrot's works:<blockquote>
<div>In Shilohs Holy Ink thy Learned Pen<br>
</div>
<div>Was dipt, which Ravished the Sons of Men.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Vision of John Perrot</span>)</blockquote>The date of Mason's death is unknown. He was apparently survived by his son, Martin, who was married in Lincoln on 29 July 1679. His daughter, Abigail, was interred in the Quakers' burial-ground in Lincoln on 4 April 1658.<br>
