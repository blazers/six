<span class="headword">Mais,  Alan Raymond</span>, Baron Mais  (1911&#150;1993), <span class="occ">engineer and businessman</span>, was born on 7 July 1911 at Rathmore, Winn Road, Southampton, the only child of Captain Ernest Mais, a master mariner, and his wife, Violet Geraldine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas. He was educated at Banister Court School, Hampshire, and later at the College of Estate Management, a part of London University, where he trained as a surveyor. Upon leaving he entered the construction industry, first with Richard Costain in 1931 and later, in 1936, with Parker Construction. After two years with Parker he established his own consulting practice, A. R. Mais &amp; Partners. On 12 September 1936 Mais married Lorna Aline, the daughter of Stanley Aspinall Boardman, a wool merchant of Addiscombe in Surrey, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>As a young man Mais became interested in military affairs, and in 1929 he joined the Territorial Army, being commissioned in the Royal West Kent regiment. Two years later he transferred to the Royal Engineers (RE), and he remained a member of the RE throughout the Second World War and afterwards, again as a Territorial, until his retirement in 1958. The occasion of his transfer from the Royal West Kents merits comment. While leading a detachment of that regiment on a march, Mais was overtaken by a mounted column of sappers. The RE commanding officer suggested, perhaps not entirely seriously, that Mais would be better off in a mounted unit. This advice, Mais later admitted, tempted him, and the transfer duly followed.<br>
<br>When war started Mais, by then a major, went first to France and then to Iraq and Iran with special forces. He was twice mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Russian order of Patriotic War for his efforts in keeping supply routes to Russia open. After returning to Britain late in 1943, he became involved in the Mulberry harbour project leading to what was perhaps the most daunting period in his military career. Two artificial harbours were to be constructed on the Normandy coast: a British one at Arromanches and an American one a few miles to the west. When construction began immediately after D-day (6 June 1944) Mais, by now a lieutenant-colonel, was in charge of constructing the pierheads and floating roadways at the British harbour under Colonel S. K. Gilbert of the Royal Engineers, who commanded the port construction force.<br>
<br>Progress, though hectic, went well at first, but disaster struck in the form of a gale which raged from 19 to 23 June and was reckoned to be the worst storm in the channel for eighty years. Because of the determination and courage of those on site, with Mais playing a leading role, the British harbour, though badly damaged, was saved. Unfortunately the nearby American harbour had to be abandoned. For his services in Normandy, Mais was again mentioned in dispatches and appointed OBE (military division).<br>
<br>Mais's beach task force had been part of the First Canadian Army, and he remained with the Canadians in the advance to the Rhine. Promoted full colonel, Mais became deputy chief engineer in Antwerp, and as hostilities came to an end he took charge of ports, waterways, and engineering in the twenty-first army group.<br>
<br>Once the war was over Mais returned to his consultancy firm. In 1948 he joined the board of the contractors Trollope and Colls, becoming joint managing director and chairman in 1963 and retiring in 1968 when the firm was taken over by Trafalgar House. During this period he held numerous other directorships, mainly, but not entirely, in construction concerns.<br>
<br>In the mid-1970s the affairs of the Peachey Property Corporation, then under the control of Sir Eric Miller, were found to be in some disorder and Mais, who had become a non-executive board member four years earlier, played a significant part in exposing Miller's mismanagement. The Department of Trade inquired into the company's activities but placed no blame on Mais, who, its inspectors reported, &#145;was largely instrumental in reforming the company&#146;. After Miller's suicide in 1977, Mais became company chairman and, for a short time, its chief executive. He relinquished the latter role when a new managing director was appointed but remained chairman.<br>
<br>As well as being an astute businessman, Mais was strongly inclined towards public service, and this marked the last thirty or so years of his life. From the 1960s onwards he served on numerous committees, mainly connected with the construction industry; these included the National Contractors' Group, the industry's &#145;Little Neddy&#146;, and governmental committees on the placing and management of contracts and works and on buildings emergency organization. He was also on the British National Export Council's committee for Canada and for two years was a member of the land commission.<br>
<br>Although on the surface Mais did not appear to be a party-political enthusiast, he had a considerable political pedigree, especially in local government. At the general election in 1945 he contested the Orpington constituency for Labour but was unsuccessful. After that somewhat quixotic venture, it was perhaps less surprising than many thought that a Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, should appoint him to a life peerage in 1967, in recognition of his services to the construction industry. He played an active, but not unduly prominent, part in the Lords until his death, sitting successively on the Labour, Liberal, and finally Liberal Democrat benches.<br>
<br>In local affairs, especially in the City of London, Mais was more conspicuous, becoming master of the Cutlers' Company and a freeman of the City and of the Paviors' Company. He was an alderman in the Walbrook ward from 1963, a sheriff in 1969&#150;70, and lord mayor in 1972, the first peer to be elected to that office since records began in 1192. He was a lieutenant of the City, a justice of the peace and, further afield, from 1976 deputy lieutenant of the county of Kent.<br>
<br>Beside his contribution to politics and public service, Mais was committed to education, and during his term as lord mayor he served, as is customary, as chancellor of City University, which had been founded as the Northampton Institute, a pre-eminent engineering school. He had been a member of the university's governing council since 1965. The chancellor's duties were largely ceremonial, and at the end of his year in office Mais was appointed pro-chancellor, in effect chairman of the governors, a post he held until 1984.<br>
<br>Apart from firm guidance as chairman, Mais's major contribution to the university was the setting up of a fund in his name which raised a substantial sum to establish a new banking and finance unit in the university's business school. The fund was generously supported by the Bank of England and by many leading British and foreign banks and other City institutions. This contribution is recognized by the annual Mais lectures, which are held at the university. Almost as an aside, Mais encouraged the foundation of the university symphony orchestra.<br>
<br>In the course of a long and active life Mais earned many honours and distinctions. In addition to those already mentioned, he held the territorial decoration the ERD, the order of the Aztec Eagle and the order of merit of Mexico, as well as honorary degrees from several universities. In addition, he was a member of several learned societies, including the institutions of civil and structural engineers, and he was a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He died on 28 November 1993 at the Sloane Hospital, 125 Albermarle Road, Beckenham, Kent, survived by his wife and children.<br>
