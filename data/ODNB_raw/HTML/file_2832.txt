<span class="headword">Bond,  Oliver</span>  (1760/61&#150;1798), <span class="occ">woollen merchant and Irish nationalist</span>, was born at St Johnstown, co. Donegal, the son of a dissenting minister. His full name may have been Oliver Cromwell Bond, as this was used in contemporary reports of his radical activities. After serving an apprenticeship in Londonderry he moved about 1783 to Dublin, where he worked as a woollen draper, initially at Pill Lane and, from 1786, in larger premises at 13 Lower Bridge Street. In June 1791 he married Eleanor Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1849), daughter of Henry Jackson, iron founder and later a senior United Irish figure; they had four children.<br>
<br>Bond joined the Dublin Society of United Irishmen at its inception in 1791. William James MacNeven later commented that &#145;He was one of the earliest in planning and promoting the union of Irishmen &hellip; His feelings were truly Irish, his principles those of an enlightened republican&#146;  (Madden, 4.166). Bond was closely involved in attempts during late 1792 to establish a new radical volunteer force in Dublin, styled the National Guard. On 1 March 1793 he and Simon Butler, as secretary and president of the Dublin Society of United Irishmen, were arrested on account of an allegedly libellous paper that had criticized the secret committee of the Irish House of Lords. Bond denied signing the paper but admitted that it had been printed on his authority. Both men were sentenced to six months' imprisonment in Dublin's Newgate gaol and fined &pound;500.<br>
<br>During the later 1790s Bond became a central member of the militant United Irishmen, who frequently used his home at Bridge Street as a meeting place. In 1797 Lady Lucy Fitzgerald described him as &#145;a great merchant, one of the handsomest and most delightful men to all appearances there ever was&#146;  (Maher, 102). R. R. Madden suggested that by 1797 Bond was a member of both the northern executive and the Leinster directory. On 12 March 1798 the Leinster delegates met at Bond's house but the organization had been betrayed to the government by one of its members, Thomas Reynolds, and all those present were arrested. Bond was again imprisoned at Newgate until his trial for high treason on 23 July. On this occasion the attorney-general characterized him as &#145;a man of strong mind and body, and of talents which, if perverted to the purposes of mischief, are formidable indeed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Trial of Oliver Bond</span>, 3). The key prosecution witness was Thomas Reynolds. Despite the searching cross-examination of Reynolds carried out by John Philpot Curran, Bond was quickly found guilty and sentenced to death. The execution was initially scheduled for 27 July but was postponed for two days. In the interim the United Irish state prisoners and the Cornwallis administration reached an agreement that saved the lives of Bond and the remaining prisoners. The latter agreed to provide a detailed statement concerning the United Irish conspiracy in return for their lives and voluntary exile.<br>
<br>Bond died suddenly in prison a few months later, on 6 September 1798. Despite allegations of suspicious circumstances the official report suggested an apoplectic seizure as the cause. He was buried in the churchyard of St Michan's, Dublin. His wife, also a sworn United Irish activist, continued the family business until 1809, when she moved with her family to Baltimore, USA, where she died on 15 September 1849.<br>
