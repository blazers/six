<span class="headword">Yelverton, Sir  Henry</span>  (1566&#150;1630), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 29 June 1566, St Peter's day, as he noted in his will, the eldest of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30213/', "Sir Christopher Yelverton (1536/7&#150;1612)")</script> of Gray's Inn and Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Margaret Catesby (<i>c</i>.1544&#150;1611). Perhaps already having received some education at Oxford, in July 1581 he matriculated with his brother Thomas from a distinctly puritan college, Christ's, Cambridge; he graduated BA from Peterhouse in 1584. It is probably at this point that he began his legal studies at Gray's Inn, although there is no record of this. Thomas and another brother, Christopher, had apparently gained a special admittance on 23 January 1580. Since their father was reader at the inn in 1574 and 1584, and treasurer in 1579 and 1585, it is likely that Henry was granted similar privileges. Henry seems to have been called to the bar on 25 April 1593 and to have become an ancient on 25 May. In Michaelmas 1595 he was a reader at Staple Inn. By about 1600 he had married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1625), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1804/', "Robert Beale (1541&#150;1601)")</script>, clerk of the council; when in London they lived in Aldersgate Street.<br>
<br>In 1597, following in his father's footsteps, Yelverton was elected MP for Northampton. As his father was speaker of the Commons in this parliament, he sat on committees for monopolies, the poor, draining the fens, husbandry and tillage, defence, tellers and receivers, and the better execution of judgments. Although in 1599 he succeeded his father as recorder of Northampton, Yelverton did not represent the borough in 1601, but he was returned to the first parliament of James I in 1604. An active speaker and one of the most active committee members, he gained a reputation as an independent man who spoke his mind. While his political principles supported the exercise of the royal prerogative, they also supported the ability of each house of parliament to conduct its affairs without interference. If a house did not confirm its rights, it would lose them and defraud the people. Thus when Sir Francis Goodwin's case came before the Commons on 30 March 1604, Yelverton argued for Goodwin to take his seat in the face of his rejection by the court of chancery and against the wishes of the king. He was applauded for holding that the case belonged to the Commons as a high court of parliament. On 5 April, when James had issued his decision, Yelverton said that the prince's command was like &#145;the roar of a lion&#146;  (Notestein, 75) but, as a working MP, he continued his independent actions. He supported granting the king a subsidy, but gradually, as grievances were handled. He supported the trial of the plotters of the Gunpowder Plot, but with &#145;due deliberation&#146;. He joined the attack on the abuses of purveyors, and declared that corruption should be &#145;crushed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Robert Bowyer</span>, 123). When the proposed Scottish union was debated in 1606&#150;7 Yelverton criticized the bill, assessing it as good for Scotland but not for England, and attacking George Hume, the earl of Dunbar, the king's Scottish favourite. As he said in a speech of 7 May 1607, Yelverton saw his allegiance to the law and the English crown, but not to the person of the king; there would be either a perfect union, or no union.<br>
<br>By this time Yelverton's legal career was well established and his puritan inclinations were visible. A keen patron of preachers, in the early years of the century he attended and took notes on the sermons of Edward Philips at St Olave's, Southwark, and subsequently published thirty-one of them, at his own expense and with a dedication to his father, as <span class="italic">Certaine Godly and Learned Sermons</span> (1605). Later he was suspected by Sir Francis Bacon of involvement in the publication of <span class="italic">The Argument of N. F.</span> (1607), an attempted vindication of fellow Gray's Inn puritan MP Nicholas Fuller, who had been charged with heresy and schism. Having been reader at the inn that Lent term, Yelverton was said by &#145;a professed friend and well-wisher&#146;  (Prest, 143) to have set his sights on the attorneyship of the court of wards and to be prepared to pay its patron, Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury, &pound;1000 for it. On either count, he tried in the three-year hiatus between parliamentary sessions (1607&#150;10) to repair his relations with the king. In January 1610 Lady Arabella Stuart and the earl of Dunfermline helped him gain an audience with James, in which he gave a fully detailed account of each of his positions and his best interpretation of why he advanced them. According to Bacon, Yelverton had now been &#145;won&#146; to the king's cause  (<span class="italic">Works of Francis Bacon</span>, 4.313), a conversion noted also by John Chamberlain on 13 January. Although unsuccessful in gaining the wards office, at some point Yelverton convinced Salisbury that he was not only learned in the law, but also blessed with elocution and sound reason.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1610 Yelverton brought an important defence to the claim of the crown to levy impositions without a parliamentary grant when he asserted that, since the law of England only extended to the high-water mark, on the seas the king could extract customs duties before allowing goods to land. However, he was generally in favour of commercial enterprise, supporting the enclosure of common lands for increased agrarian production. He also outlined in discussions on the royal prerogative the rights of citizens in royal leases, forfeitures, licences of alienation, fines, and wardship. Active in mediation, he began to serve the crown in legal capacities, acting as a junior member of assize commissions on the home counties circuit in 1610, and the western circuit in 1613.<br>
<br>Following his father's death on 31 October 1612, Yelverton succeeded to the family estates. One of the richest barristers of the Jacobean era, he came to own considerable property in London, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, and Warwickshire. He was made solicitor-general on 28 October 1613, and knighted on 8 November, according to John Chamberlain for parliamentary services to the king and his ability to survive disgrace. It was said that he attained the office through the patronage of the king's favourite, Sir Robert Carr, shortly after he became earl of Somerset. For three years from 1614 Yelverton was also counsel for the University of Cambridge. He was returned as Northampton's MP in March 1614 after drafting a new charter reincorporating the borough that was enrolled in August; the borough extended his recordership for life in 1618. In the parliament of 1614 he was not active, and abstained from speaking on the crucial question of impositions. He took an official part in the examination of Peacham under torture on 19 January 1615, as well as on 10 March, showing a toughness he was suspected of repeating during the examinations of Sir Thomas Lake in 1619 and Samuel Peacock in 1620. At the same time he joined in signing a certification in favour of the court of chancery in the conflict with Sir Edward Coke on the question of <i>praemunire</i>, and supported the king's resolution. When Somerset was indicted for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury in 1615, Yelverton declined to appear against him and took no part in the trial.<br>
<br>With Bacon's appointment as lord keeper in 1617, James announced that Yelverton would succeed him as attorney-general. The warrant, however, stayed unsigned as the new favourite, the earl of Buckingham, was doubtful of his commitment to the prerogative. Yelverton refused to apply to the earl because he believed that the office concerned the king alone. When Buckingham told Yelverton that his standing would suffer if the attorney-generalship were seen to be conferred without the earl's influence, Yelverton answered that it was not the custom for favourites to meddle with legal appointments. Apparently unoffended, Buckingham took the warrant to the king and returned with it signed on 12 March. Afterwards Yelverton presented James with &pound;4000. The favourite apparently received nothing, but on the other hand Yelverton acted as a mediator in the dispute which arose between Buckingham and members of the Coke family over the marriage of Frances Coke and John Villiers. When dissension over the fate of their daughter finally led Lady Elizabeth Coke to leave her husband, Yelverton alienated Coke by not listening to his arguments to bar his wife from her dower. Yelverton continued to use his position to support godly ministers. The same year he was responsible for the appointment of Richard Sibbes as preacher at Gray's Inn; acknowledgement of his role was made in the dedications of works by Paul Baynes, William Crashawe (preacher at the Temple), Samuel Hieron, and Thomas Gataker.<br>
<br>Yelverton became a commissioner of patents on 22 April 1618 and was placed on another commission, for the punishment of offenders, on 20 October. In high favour at court, he entertained it &#145;very bountifully&#146; on 11 September 1619  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 2.263). Having previously shown some sympathy to those who infringed the patent for gold and silver thread, since they refused to give an undertaking not to repeat the offences he now sent some of them to the Fleet prison. Apparently still uncertain of the legality of such a move, he signalled that he would release them unless Bacon endorsed his ruling. Using Yelverton's initial opposition to patents, Buckingham then took the opportunity to remove him. The device was Yelverton's penning of the new charter for the City of London. Charged with introducing certain clauses not in the king's warrant, he was summoned to the privy council, which recommended on 16 June 1620 that he be suspended from office and prosecuted in the Star Chamber. Duly suspended on 27 June, a month later he acknowledged his offence in Star Chamber and, although found not guilty of corruption, was sentenced to imprisonment in the Tower during the king's pleasure on 10 November, and fined &pound;1000. Thomas Coventry replaced him as attorney-general early in the new year.<br>
<br>In spite of his imprisonment Yelverton was returned for Northampton in the parliament that opened on 30 January 1621. Caught up in Bacon's bribery scandal that occupied parliament in February&#150;March, he gained the opprobrium of Buckingham, who saw Yelverton as an agent of his destruction. This worked against Yelverton in the following debates on monopolies, where he was targeted for having imprisoned the gold and silver thread agents, whose wives and children petitioned the king for their release. On the one hand vilified in the Commons by Coke for making false arrests, on the other he was blamed for bad advice by the king, who had jurisdiction of the case transferred to the Lords on 18 April 1621. Yelverton's defence, that he had served the king by passing his patents and defusing opposition in the Commons, caused James to accuse him on 24 April of slander. Yelverton, relying on support from those who wished to use monopolies to attack Buckingham, made a powerful speech in the Lords on 30 April. In the past decade he had avoided conflict with the crown. Now he stood his ground, and blamed the arrests on the duke and his quest for profits, charging that Buckingham &#145;stood still att the Kinges elbowe ready to hew me downe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 34). This raised pandemonium in the house, and James had Yelverton seized and recommitted to the Tower. The Lords claimed that this seizure was a breach of their privileges. Petitioning the king, he was returned to the Lords, where his tumultuous trial for &#145;misdemeanours&#146; ended on 14 May. The following day he was found guilty of impugning the king and slandering Buckingham, and on 16 June he was sentenced to prison with orders to submit to the king and Buckingham, and to pay them 10,000 marks and 5000 marks respectively. Once he had submitted the fines were remitted, and on 18 July Yelverton was released as part of a general pardon.<br>
<br>In Michaelmas term 1621 Yelverton resumed practice in the king's bench, chancery, and Star Chamber that had occupied him prior to his appointment as attorney-general in 1617. He also returned to sitting on assize circuits. Soon after Charles's accession, on 30 April 1625 he was made serjeant-at-law, and on 10 May he was promoted to judge of the court of common pleas. His wife had died four days earlier. It may have been in these later years as a judge that he prepared his and his father's law reports on the court of king's bench, 1602&#150;12, which were later published in 1661 and 1674. He remained on the bench until his death at Aldersgate Street on 24 January 1630. Buried at Easton Maudit next to his parents, the lawyer described by Roger Wilbraham as &#145;the old Tribune of the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Robert Bowyer</span>, 134), had given generously to the poor of London and Easton. In his will dated 19 July 1628, after a vividly personal expression of his faith, Yelverton left his land at Weston, Warwickshire, to his younger son, Robert, who had studied under John Preston at Queens' College, Cambridge, and who was knighted in 1631. The bulk of his estates went to the elder son, Sir Christopher (<i>d</i>. 1655), also a former student of Preston, who was knighted in 1623 and made a baronet in 1641, with generous provision for his three sisters, Elizabeth (the wife of Sir Lodowick Dyer), Edith, and Mary. Other beneficiaries included Yelverton's brother, now also Sir Christopher, his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37954/', "Christopher Sherland")</script>, and Richard Sibbes.<br>
