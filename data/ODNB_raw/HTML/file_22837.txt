<span class="headword">Proctor,  John</span>  (1521&#150;1558), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, was born in Somerset and matriculated as of that county at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in January 1537, being described as sixteen years and nine months old. He graduated BA on 20 October 1540 and was immediately elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, suggesting a successful undergraduate career. He proceeded MA on 9 February 1545 and resigned his fellowship in 1546. This may have been on account of a reluctance to take orders, connected with a desire to marry. It is not known what Proctor did after leaving Oxford. He would have found the regime of Edward VI distasteful, and may well have served as tutor in some conservative household. In 1549 he published an attack on certain aspects of the protestant programme, entitled <span class="italic">The Fall of the Late Arrian</span>.<br>
<br>In 1553 Proctor was appointed as the first master of the newly founded Tonbridge School, and he continued to hold that post until his death in October or early November 1558. His will, which is dated 23 October, is a most interesting document. In it he requested burial in the chancel &#145;dyrectly where I use to sytt&#146;, and bequeathed vestments, a crucifix, and a corporas case to the church. At the same time the preamble bequeathed his soul &#145;unto almightie god thorough the passyon of whose deare sonne Jesus Chryst I do assuredly beleve that I shall enioye the merittes of heaven&#146;&#151;which would normally be described as a protestant formula  (CKS, MS DR6/pwr 12, fols. 328&#150;9). His wife, Elizabeth, was named as sole executrix and residual legatee, and he made modest bequests to his sister, his brother William, and his godchildren. Twenty shillings were also set aside for a dole at his funeral, in the traditional manner. He was buried in the parish church at Tonbridge, probably on 3 November. According to the parish register, Elizabeth married Henry Stubberfield on 12 July 1559, two days before John's will was proved. There is no mention of children, but perhaps Elizabeth was pregnant at the time of his death, thereby accounting for the delay of probate. The poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22839/', "Thomas Proctor")</script> is usually identified as his son. The John Proctor who was presented to the rectory of St Andrew's, Holborn, in 1578, and who died in the autumn of 1584, was clearly a different man.<br>
<br>Proctor's chief claim to notice is his authorship of <span class="italic">The Historie of Wyates Rebellion</span> (1554; 2nd edn, 1555). He was hostile to the rebels, representing them as covert heretics masquerading under a concern about the Spanish marriage. He was also very close to the events which he described, and his work has always been accepted as an informed source about the events of late January and early February 1554, particularly in Kent. If he wrote with any expectation of reward from the government, however, he seems to have been disappointed. In 1554 he also published a work of Catholic piety, entitled <span class="italic">The Way Home to Christ and Truth</span>, but this was not an original composition, being a translation of the fifth-century <span class="italic">Liber de catholicae fidei antiquitate</span> by Vincent of L&eacute;rins. Although this is described as &#145;by the Queenes highnes authorised to be sette forthe&#146;, he seems to have received no reward for this work either.<br>
