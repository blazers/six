<span class="headword">Ashton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, is of unknown origins. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, being elected to a fellowship about 1520, shortly after graduating BA. He proceeded MA in 1521 and BTh in 1531. Little is known of his subsequent career until his appointment as headmaster of Shrewsbury School in 1561, except that he was still a fellow of St John's in 1542, and held a benefice in Lincoln diocese. In April 1561 Bishop Bentham of Lichfield requested Archbishop Parker to license Ashton's non-residence on the grounds that the progress of the school at Shrewsbury would be damaged by his departure, and that Ashton was the only licensed preacher in the district. He was known to be a strong protestant.<br>
<br>Ashton successfully raised the prestige of the school, which Camden described as the largest in England. Between 1562 and 1569, 875 boys were admitted, with a total of 266 on the roll at the end of 1562, half of whom boarded at houses in the town. Pupils were drawn from the sons of the gentry from surrounding counties, and from as far away as Buckinghamshire. Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Fulke Greville were among those who studied there during Ashton's headmastership. Ashton made notable contributions to the school in the field of drama, and in securing important endowments from the crown. St John's, the headmaster's old college, had a notable dramatic tradition, and this may have influenced the bailiffs of Shrewsbury, who had their own interest in theatrical productions, in his appointment. Under Ashton the highest form of the school was required to perform one act of a play each Thursday, and much effort was put into the annual Whitsuntide production in the open space known as the Quarry. These productions were written by Ashton and took religious themes, and included <span class="italic">Julian the Apostate</span> (1566) and <span class="italic">The Passion of Christ</span> (1569), the latter of which lasted all the holidays and attracted a large audience of nobles and gentry.<br>
<br>Between 1568 and 1571 Ashton spent much time away from Shrewsbury, in the course of which he obtained from the crown valuable tithes from the rectory of Chirbury and the dissolved college of St Mary in Shrewsbury. He retired from the school in 1571, and entered into the service of Walter Devereux, subsequently earl of Essex. He did not completely sever his links with the school, and was responsible for drawing up a set of ordinances for its government, which were adopted in 1578 and remained in force until 1798. While the appointment of the headmaster remained with the bailiffs and preference was to be given to former pupils, St John's College, Cambridge, exercised an academic veto over candidates. Ashton's duties in the service of Devereux initially consisted of superintending his employer's affairs in his absence, and acting as tutor to his son Robert. He was also employed by the crown, possibly as one of the network of agents and spies maintained by Burghley; to him he wrote in 1571 warning of the extent of Catholic influence in Shropshire, and recommending Sir Andrew Corbet, a fellow puritan, for the magistracy. He also corresponded with Burghley concerning Thomas Browne, a Shrewsbury draper, who had played a minor role in uncovering the duke of Norfolk's treasonable dealings with Ridolfi and Mary, queen of Scots. In 1573 he was admitted to the Buckinghamshire living of Haversham.<br>
<br>In 1574 Ashton was sent to Ireland to persuade Essex to make peace with Turlough Luineach O'Neill. He was successful, and was subsequently chosen as mediator in a serious quarrel between Essex and Leicester. In 1575 Ashton was again sent to Ireland by the queen, desiring Essex to give up his Ulster enterprise. When Essex died in 1576 he bequeathed Ashton an annuity of &pound;40 for life and made him a trustee for his son. Following the settlement of the affairs of Essex, Ashton devoted his energies to securing the ordinances for governing Shrewsbury School. In August 1578 he paid a final visit to Shrewsbury for their sealing, following which he returned to Cambridge, where he died on 28 August.<br>
