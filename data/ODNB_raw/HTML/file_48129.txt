<span class="headword">Quilter,  William</span>  (1808&#150;1888), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 7 August 1808, the youngest of four sons of Samuel Sacker Quilter, a farmer, and his wife, Sarah May Chapman. Little is known of his early life other than that he went to London at the age of seventeen and joined the office of one of the leading public accountants of the day, Peter Harriss Abbott. Abbott was one of the first accountants whose value was recognized by the government, being appointed a commissioner inquiring into the method of keeping public accounts in 1829. Four years later he was appointed an official assignee in bankruptcy, leaving Quilter to enter into partnership with another of his former clerks, John Ball. The new firm benefited from a continued connection with Abbott who, in his new position, was able to commission the partnership to prepare financial statements for debtors prior to their appearance in court. Quilter married Elizabeth Harriot, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cuthbert (<i>d</i>. 1874), in 1834 and they had three sons, including the art collector and politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35643/', "Sir William Cuthbert Quilter")</script> and the art critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35641/', "Harry Quilter")</script>, and two daughters.<br>
<br>A major stimulus for an already well-established practice was the collapse of the railway mania in 1847, resulting in shareholder committees engaging public accountants to help them to investigate the machinations of failed companies. The most famous revelations were contained in the report Quilter, Ball &amp; Co. was called in to prepare on the affairs of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, whose chairman was George Hudson, the Railway King. The report showed that profit had been overstated by well over &pound;400,000: &pound;318,144 was wrongly omitted from the debit of the revenue account, &pound;35,315 was wrongly credited to the revenue account, and interest amounting to &pound;84,591 was charged to capital instead of revenue. Indications of the prominent role played by the firm in the handling of insolvency work are estimates that they were responsible for 8 of the 43 cases chronicled by D. M. Evans as arising out of the commercial crisis of 1847&#150;8 and 31 of the 147 cases arising during a corresponding crisis ten years later  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 792). As organizations increasingly took advantage of the option for companies to register with limited liability under the <span class="roman">Companies Act</span> of 1862, Quilter began to develop in addition a substantial audit practice. This may have compensated for a diminishing involvement in liquidations, with his firm placed sixth in an analysis made of the number and value of liquidations in the hands of leading London practices in 1866  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). Quilter was invited to give evidence to the government select committee on the audit of railway accounts appointed in 1849 where he expressed the belief that his practice was the most extensive in England. A particular feature of Quilter's evidence was his opposition to any requirement that the auditors of railway companies should be shareholders, based on the belief that this compromised their independence. The gradual replacement of the shareholders as auditor by the professional is a notable feature of the history of auditing during the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Further evidence of government recognition was the appointment of Quilter's firm to undertake a large-scale investigation of the army clothing store in Weedon in 1859 while, together with William Turquand, he was appointed by the Board of Trade as an investigating inspector under the <span class="roman">Joint Stock Companies Act</span> 1856.<br>
<br>It may well be that Quilter's heavy personal investment in railway shares&#151;he owned shares valued at more than &pound;276,000 at the time of his death&#151;explains the fact that his firm were never permanent auditors of any of the major British railways. It is known, however, that he did hold shares in railways where his partners were auditors. Quilter also benefited from family links with some of the companies of which he was auditor. His son Sir William Cuthbert Quilter was a director of several of these companies including the National Telephone Company and Swan United Electric Light. There was also Eley Brothers, the cartridge makers, of which the young Quilter was also a shareholder and director. Important audits undertaken by the firm included that of the Hudson Bay Company from 1863, the Birmingham Joint Stock Bank from 1866, the Alliance Bank (jointly with John Sutherland Harmood-Banner) from 1869, the London Joint Stock and the Eastern Telegraph (each jointly with Deloittes) and the Bank of Australia. At the time of his death Quilter's firm audited more than seventy quoted companies.<br>
<br>In addition to being a successful practitioner, Quilter may be seen as a leading architect of the British accounting profession. It was he who called a meeting at his office of nine leading practitioners in 1870 to propose the formation of an institute of accountants in London. This action was part of an endeavour to achieve chartered status and so distinguish &#145;chartered accountants&#146; from others who were seen to be bringing the practice of accountancy into disrepute. The new institute was formed in December 1870 with Quilter elected its first president. It was an &eacute;litist organization, insisting on high entrance fees and demanding entrance requirements. The resulting slow rate of growth and continued failure to obtain a royal charter, together with the more rapid expansion of rival professional associations, led to growing criticism of the institute's performance and, accordingly, Quilter's leadership. He resigned his position as president in January 1877 and both his seat on the council and membership of the institute the following May. Thus, when the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was established in 1880 and a royal charter obtained, Quilter was no longer a member.<br>
<br>Many leaders of the profession passed through the office of Quilter, Ball &amp; Co.: they included the founders of Cooper Brothers, William and Arthur; and three of Quilter's clerks became president of the institute&#151;Thomas Abercrombie Welton, Arthur Cooper, and J. B. Ball. However, perhaps his best-known employee in the world of business was John Reeve Ellerman who, after refusing an offer of partnership, left in 1886 to found his shipping empire.<br>
<br>Some fascinating insights into the man were provided by Ernest Cooper in an obituary. Quilter is described as:<blockquote>accountant, art collector, and something of a financier. I remember attending a meeting of creditors, when Mr. Quilter walked about the room, distributing copies of the statement of affairs. He had more the appearance of a farmer than a professional man. He sold his great collection to Christie's some years before his death for a very large sum, and left one of the largest professional fortunes, if not the largest, I have ever noticed, but not, it was said, mainly earned directly from our profession. (Cooper, 555)</blockquote>His notable collection of watercolours fetched &pound;58,000 at Christies in 1875; and the value of the remaining pictures at the time of his death was &pound;31,486. Quilter died on 12 November 1888 at his home, 28 Norfolk Street, Park Lane, London, leaving well over half a million pounds, one of the largest known estates of any Victorian accountant.<br>
