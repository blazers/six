<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trapp,  John</span>  (1601&#150;1669), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer on theology</span>, was born at Croome d'Abitot, Worcestershire, on 5 June 1601, the son of Nicholas Trapp, yeoman of Kemsey. He was educated at the free school in Worcester and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 15 October 1619 and graduated BA in 1622. John Ley, later a colleague in Warwickshire, was one of his tutors. On graduation Trapp became usher of the free school in Stratford upon Avon (where an older kinsman, Simon Trapp, was already curate), succeeding as headmaster in April 1624. Having proceeded MA on 17 June, twelve days later he married Mary Gibbard at Holy Trinity, Stratford; the couple had a large family of at least ten children.<br>
<br>Trapp was preacher at the Stratford chapelry of Luddington in the early 1630s with a salary provided by Edward Conway, second Lord Conway, and in 1636 was presented to the vicarage of Weston-on-Avon, Gloucestershire (2 miles from Stratford), by Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex. His first publication, <span class="italic">God's Love Tokens and the Afflicted Man's Lessons</span> (1637), was a funeral sermon for Cranfield's daughter. Trapp was active in south Warwickshire puritan circles in the 1630s, discussing sermons and exchanging manuscripts with Samuel Clarke, Thomas Dugard, and others. He joined in the petitioning against the Laudian innovations in 1640, and acted as a chaplain to the parliamentary garrison in Warwick Castle under Colonel John Bridges from 1644 to 1646. In May 1646 he claimed in a letter to friends in New England that he had been held to ransom by royalists in the summer of 1643 and threatened again in the following year. He was contemptuous of his beleaguered royalist patron, denouncing Middlesex from the pulpit of another Cranfield living, Welford-on-Avon, where Trapp had replaced the royalist incumbent. But Trapp was no radical: rather he was committed to a reformed national church and signed the Warwickshire ministers' &#145;Testimony&#146; against sectarianism and religious liberty in 1648. In 1654&#150;5 he was among the Warwickshire ministers who operated a semi-formal classis centred on Kenilworth.<br>
<br>Trapp's supreme achievement as a writer was his commentaries on all the books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, issued in parts and then combined editions from the mid-1640s to the 1660s. <span class="italic">A Brief Commentary upon the Gospel According to St John</span> inaugurated the series in 1646, while <span class="italic">Annotations upon the Old and New Testament</span> (five volumes in one) completed it in 1662. The many surviving copies suggest that this voluminous and mostly uncontroversial work was a useful reference tool for contemporary clergy in particular. Its topical references to writings against sectarianism and other mid-century polemic did not prevent several reprints being issued in the later seventeenth century and a further edition in the mid-nineteenth.<br>
<br>Trapp was one of the alternative candidates suggested by Richard Baxter when he turned down a bishopric in 1660. Although he lost the Welford living when the previous incumbent returned at the Restoration, Trapp conformed in 1662 and continued to serve at Weston and Stratford. He seems to have accommodated himself to the religious changes of his life with little difficulty, changing the dedicatees in the various editions of his published works to chime with the vagaries of power: he honoured Cranfield before the civil war, Bridges in the 1640s and 1650s, and royalist gentry in the 1660s. Trapp died on 17 October 1669 and was buried at Weston. He was described by his neighbour John Hall, who treated him for melancholy in 1635, as being &#145;for his piety and learning second to none&#146;  (Lane, 344). To his friend Thomas Dugard, in a commendatory verse to Trapp's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses</span>, he was &#145;One of this Age's Greatest Little Men&#146;: small in stature, yet an imposing religious writer.<br>
