<span class="headword">Prain, Sir  Ronald Lindsay</span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 3 September 1907 in Iquiqui, Chile, the elder child of Arthur Lindsay Prain (1879&#150;1965), nitrates manager, and his wife, Amy Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson (1878&#150;1958). His maternal grandfather was Charles Watson, business partner of &#145;honest&#146; Henry Meiggs, who made and lost a fabulous fortune building railways in Peru, and his paternal grandfather was John Prain, of Valpara&iacute;so, Chile. At the age of seven Prain moved to London with his parents. Educated in Bournemouth and at Cheltenham College, to which he remained strongly attached, eventually serving as president of its council, his first job in the City was as a cashier with the metal trading firm of Marshall Brothers, subsequently Anglo Metal and then Ametalco, a subsidiary of the American Metal Company in New York. His progress was rapid. Having caught the eye first of Robert Mayer and then of Chester Beatty, Prain was appointed to the board of Anglo Metal in 1936, and in 1937 to the boards of the Rhodesian Selection Trust (RST) and Roan Antelope, in both of which American Metal had recently acquired substantial shareholdings. Together with the Anglo-American Corporation of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer these two companies were largely instrumental in the development of the Northern Rhodesian copper mining industry. On 23 April the following year, he married, at St Peter's Church, Cranley Gardens, London, Esther Pansy Brownrigg (<i>d</i>. 1987), the 28-year-old daughter of Norman Graham Brownrigg, schoolmaster. They had two sons, Graham (<i>b</i>. 1940) and Angus (<i>b</i>. 1952).<br>
<br>Turned down by the army on medical grounds for active service during the Second World War, Prain (while continuing as a director of Anglo Metal, RST, and Roan Antelope) was invited by Oliver Lyttelton to join the Ministry of Supply as controller of diamond dies and quartz crystals, used respectively in fine-wire drawing tools and for radio telegraphy and submarine detection (asdic) purposes. The excellent job he did in meeting these vital wartime needs of British industry was recognized in 1946 by his appointment as OBE. In 1943 Prain had become managing director of Mufulira and Roan Antelope, RST's two large central African copper mines, and in 1950 he succeeded Chester Beatty as chairman of the Rhodesian companies, a position he occupied until his retirement in 1972. From this point, his career was intimately associated with central Africa's copper mining industry, and the wider economic and political vicissitudes of the region. With the shift of RST's headquarters first to Northern Rhodesia in 1953, and then to Salisbury, capital of the recently established Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, in 1955, Prain moved with his family to Africa. A friend of Sir Roy Welensky, the leader of Northern Rhodesia's white settlers who became prime minister of the federation in 1956, Prain believed federation would be good for business. He pushed hard and successfully for African advancement in the copper mines under RST control, breaking the colour bar enforced by white workers. His motives were as much practical as they were moral. The problem, as Prain saw it, was not that Africans were underpaid, but that Europeans were overpaid, an opinion not precisely calculated to secure the support of either black or white miners.<br>
<br>Increasingly disillusioned by the failure of successive federal governments to practise multiracial &#145;partnership&#146;, Prain and Harold Hochschild, the chairman of American Metal, RST's parent company, by 1959 had distanced themselves from Welensky's United Federal Party. Sensitive to African nationalist aspirations, RST put out feelers to leading black politicians, notably Kenneth Kaunda, &#145;a remarkable man&#146; in Prain's estimation  (<span class="italic">Reflections on an Era</span>, 143). Such unofficial contacts were a useful source of information for the government of Harold Macmillan, as it grappled with the problem of constitutional advance in central Africa. Later described as &#145;the acceptable face of British capitalism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 May 1991), Prain, who was knighted in 1956, was credited with placing business in a stronger position than it might otherwise have been to weather the storms of decolonization. Such political foresight, it was thought, contrasted favourably with the apparently conservative attitude displayed by the other major mining house on the copperbelt, the Johannesburg-based Anglo-American Corporation. On Northern Rhodesia's independence as the republic of Zambia in 1964, RST changed its name from the Rhodesian Selection Trust to the Roan Selection Trust. In 1969, however, both RST and Anglo-American's Zambian interests were part-nationalized by Kaunda's self-consciously African socialist government. No distinction was drawn between the two groups, and one year later RST, whose corporate eggs had all been in one Zambian copper basket, was folded into American Metal's successor company, Amax, and ceased to exist.<br>
<br>Often referred to in the popular press as Mr Copper, Ronnie Prain retired secure in the esteem of by far the larger part of the mining community. A frequent speaker on the problems and prospects of the industry, he had published <span class="italic">Selected Papers</span> in four volumes between 1958 and 1968; in retirement he wrote <span class="italic">Copper: the Anatomy of an Industry</span> (1975), and an autobiography, <span class="italic">Reflections on an Era</span> (1981). In 1954 he had been instrumental in persuading RST to endow the Rhodes chair of race relations at St Antony's College, Oxford, and he later lent his name to a research fellowship in race relations at the same college. While there existed some doubt about the depth of his scientific knowledge, he was none the less a past president of the Institute of Metals, chairman of the Council of Commonwealth Mining and Metallurgical Institutions, and the recipient of numerous medals and awards, including from the New York Copper Club. In the British metal world his attempt to address fluctuations in the cost of copper by offering an &#145;RST producer price&#146; at lower levels than those prevailing on the London metal exchange was criticized in market circles even as it won support from his shareholders and others concerned for the industry's long-term prospects. An indefatigable traveller, he claimed that over his career he had clocked up almost two million air miles. At one time a keen cricketer, his sporting prowess made him some unusual contacts. A pre-war match against a Hollywood eleven, among whose members was Boris Karloff, resulted in an acquaintanceship that later benefited Prain when Karloff sold him a coveted London flat ahead of other would-be purchasers. Prain died of heart failure at his home, Waverley, Granville Road, St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey, on 10 May 1991. He was survived by his two sons, his wife having predeceased him.<br>
