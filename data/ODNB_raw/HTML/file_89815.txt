<span class="headword">Kirk,  Geoffrey Stephen</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">Greek scholar</span>, was born at 11 Park Terrace, The Park, Nottingham, on 3 December 1921, the younger child and only son of Frederic Tilzey (Ferdie) Kirk, an educational administrator, and his wife, Enid Hilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pentecost (1893&#150;2002). His father, &#145;a dashing and affectionate figure&#146;  (Kirk, 2), had been awarded the MC in the First World War, and in mid-career became a factory manager. His mother had read natural sciences at Cambridge and worked for a time after her marriage as a technical research chemist in Nottingham. The family lived for some years at Radlett in Hertfordshire, where Kirk had his early schooling. At Rossall School (1935&#150;40) he developed a serious interest in classics, and in 1939 he won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>After taking part one of the classical tripos in one year (1940&#150;41) Kirk left for service in the Royal Navy, which lasted until 1945 and which he later described as &#145;one of the most dramatic as well as the most fulfilling epochs of my life&#146;  (Kirk, 195). After serving with coastal forces in Britain, he decided to try for a posting to the eastern Mediterranean:<blockquote>my contact with the Classics so far, at school and at Cambridge, had made a curiously deep impression &hellip; I loved the idea of ancient Greece and had a romantic desire to have a hand in liberating its modern successor: all very Byronic, in a modified middle-class sort of way. (Kirk, 77&#150;8)</blockquote>He served in the Levant schooner flotilla, eventually captaining one of the caiques that carried out dangerous missions in occupied waters, including several landings in Greece. He much later published a memoir which gave a detailed account of these experiences, but made no mention of the award of the DSC in 1945.<br>
<br>After demobilization Kirk returned to Cambridge to take part two of the classical tripos; the teachers who meant most to him were Nicholas Hammond and F. H. (Harry) Sandbach, and his distinguished first in 1946 earned him the offer of a research fellowship at Trinity Hall. As a research fellow he spent two years working abroad. He had already identified his main field of study as pre-Socratic philosophy, but he grasped the opportunity to extend his range. At the British School at Athens in 1947&#150;8 he wrote a long article on ships in early Greek vase painting, his first publication. He spent 1949&#150;50 as a Commonwealth Fund fellow at Harvard, and the links he formed then with American classical scholarship remained strong for the rest of his career: he returned to Harvard as a guest lecturer in 1958, held a chair at Yale in 1965&#150;70, and was Sather professor at Berkeley in 1968&#150;9 and Mellon professor at Tulane in 1979. In 1950 he married Barbara Helen Traill, an artist who shared his interest in buildings, furniture, and fine art. They had one daughter, Lydia, who became a cathedral mason. His first spell at Cambridge in a permanent post (as a teaching fellow of Trinity Hall) lasted from 1950 to 1965; from 1951 he concurrently held a series of university appointments (as assistant lecturer, then lecturer from 1952 and reader from 1961). This was rapid promotion at a period when a lectureship was the career grade. Election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1959 and the award of a LittD in 1965 reflected the impact made by his publications, notably <span class="italic">Heraclitus: the Cosmic Fragments</span> (1954), <span class="italic">The Presocratic Philosophers</span> (with J. E. Raven, 1958), and <span class="italic">The Songs of Homer</span> (1962), which together established his international reputation.<br>
<br>In 1971 Kirk took up a chair of Greek at Bristol, where for two years he overlapped with his old mentor Nicholas Hammond. This appointment was soon followed by election to the regius chair of Greek at Cambridge, Kirk's final post, which he held from 1974 to 1982, with a fellowship at Trinity. In 1979, as president of the Hellenic Society, he led a delegation to Greece to celebrate the society's centenary. He was the driving force in ensuring that the scattered activities of the classics faculty were brought together in a new building on a single site, creating an academic community for the growing numbers of graduate students. The move to Cambridge also coincided with upheavals in Kirk's personal life: in 1975 his first marriage was dissolved, and on 4 September that year he married Kirsten Oda Ricks, the daughter of Harald Jensen, corn merchant, and former wife of Christopher Ricks, later professor of English at Cambridge; he thus became stepfather to her four children. They lived for some years, both during Kirk's tenure of the chair and after he retired, at Woodbridge in Suffolk, where he kept up his interest in sailing; later they moved to Bath. The last major achievement of his academic career was the large-scale <span class="italic">Iliad</span> commentary in six volumes (1985&#150;93), of which he was general editor, as well as the author of the first two volumes. The project brought out Kirk's capacity for strategic thinking: Nicholas Richardson, one of his collaborators, later praised his &#145;combination of firm editorial policy with generous flexibility&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 5 May 2003).<br>
<br>Kirk was a highly creative person who could stimulate the intellectual energy and imagination of others as well as doing pioneering work himself, particularly in his younger days, when he was remembered as coming as a &#145;breath of fresh air&#146; to post-war Cambridge  (private information). He was adventurous and wide-ranging in his intellectual interests: his work on myth, for example (particularly <span class="italic">Myth: its Meaning and Function in Ancient and Other Cultures</span>, 1970), showed how much he owed to anthropology, and he had a strong interest in diverse oral traditions. He had a remarkable gift for sensing what were the most significant areas of research and for joining up scholarly expertise across the disciplines&#151;philosophical, archaeological, literary, linguistic&#151;in such a way as to make his ideas accessible to less informed readers. He wrote with great clarity, making a point of avoiding a heavily erudite style, but showing acute critical judgement.<br>
<br>A handsome man with a memorable speaking voice, great vitality, and a wonderful wit, Kirk could be a charmingly irreverent colleague, and he made many friends. His dislike for pomposity and self-importance was often invigorating, but his sardonic humour and impatience with those he found boring or pretentious could also make him combative in personal relations. In print he managed his aggression admirably and had no taste for pedantic polemic, but he did not always show the same patience face to face, and this may have been one of the reasons why he never felt a deep vocation for teaching. Despite his many achievements there was a curious ambivalence in his view of himself, partly arising from self-doubt about his role as an academic, and reinforced perhaps by his wartime experience of a different way of living. In retirement he suffered increasingly from depressive illness, and his later years were often stressful and unsettled. He died on 10 March 2003 at Copper Beeches nursing home, Heath Mount, Rake, West Sussex, of heart failure. He was survived by his second wife, Kirsten, his daughter from his first marriage, and his four stepchildren.<br>
