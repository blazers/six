<span class="headword">Dowden,  John</span>  (1840&#150;1910), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of Edinburgh and scholar</span>, was born on 29 June 1840 at Cork, the fifth of the five surviving children of John Wheeler Dowden (1799&#150;1891), linen draper, and his wife, Alicia Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1869), daughter of John Barter Bennett, surgeon and chemist. His father, a leading merchant in the town, had interests in literature and contemporary thought which were not restricted by his devout Presbyterianism. His mother was an equally devout member of the Church of Ireland. Throughout his life Dowden was close to his father, and to his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32882/', "Edward Dowden")</script>, later professor of English literature at Dublin University.<br>
<br>In Cork Dowden attended both the Scots Church and the local parish church. Educated at the diocesan school, by private tutors, and at Dr Douglas's school, at the age of sixteen he matriculated at Queen's College, Cork, gaining scholarships in his first and second years. But throughout his education uncertain health prevented him from realizing his full intellectual potential. Previously set on a medical career, he began to consider becoming a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, and accordingly his father sent him in October 1858 to Trinity College, Dublin, while he made up his mind.<br>
<br>Dowden attended Trinity College from 1858 to 1864, exhibiting a lifelong love of literature and music. He graduated BA in 1861 with first-class honours in logic and ethics, and then joined the divinity class, becoming known for his attachment to the theology of the Oxford Movement. Although reverencing John Henry Newman, he was never attracted to ritualist extremes. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Verschoyle of Kilmore on 17 July 1864 to the curacy of St John's, Sligo. On 15 September 1864 he married Louisa Jones, daughter of Francis Jones, a civil engineer, and they had six children. Ordained priest in 1865, with his delicate health and scholarly bent he found the ministry in a small county town difficult, being generally regarded by the parishioners as high-church. In 1867 he was appointed perpetual curate of Calry, a suburb of Cork. Not a natural, but a conscientious pastor, Dowden also began to develop his liturgical scholarship in articles in the new <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. In 1870 he was appointed one of the chaplains to Lord Spenser, the lord lieutenant. A more congenial appointment came in 1872 when the rector of the fashionable Dublin church, St Stephen's, invited him to be one of the curates.<br>
<br>In September 1874 Dowden accepted the appointment as Pantonian professor of theology at the Scottish Episcopal church's Trinity College, Glenalmond, the warden being an acquaintance from his parish days in Cork. Before leaving for Scotland he graduated BD at Trinity College, Dublin. Glenalmond was founded in 1846 to be both a public school and a divinity institution, but the latter was struggling when he arrived in 1874, owing to the school's remoteness and the age differences between divinity students and schoolboys. A fire in the school the next year saw the theological institution move to Edinburgh, which gave Dowden the combination he wanted of a liberal theological environment with a devotional grounding, and student numbers began to increase. An exacting though sympathetic teacher, Dowden was devoted to the advancement of Scots in the higher offices of the church as against the contemporary Episcopalian preference for educated Englishmen. In 1876 he was awarded a DD from Trinity College. His scholarship bore lasting fruit in 1884 in his still authoritative annotated edition of the Scottish communion office, the eucharistic liturgy of the eighteenth-century nonjuring Episcopalians which continued to be used by various congregations of the Scottish Episcopal church. The work contributed to a renewed sympathy for the Scottish office among Scottish Episcopalians. Widening recognition of his scholarship saw the University of Dublin appoint him Donnellan lecturer in 1885&#150;6, and in 1886&#150;7 he was select preacher there and in 1888 at the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1886 Dowden was elected bishop of Edinburgh (after the refusal of the position by Canon Henry Liddon); he was consecrated on 21 September, the most scholarly Scottish Episcopal bishop of his day. This scholarship could have unfortunate consequences: he adopted the archaic Latin title of John Edenburgen which, by its apparent territorial implications, offended Presbyterian sensibilities, as did his hard line against Episcopalians preaching in Presbyterian churches in his diocese. But Dowden continued to be best known as a theologian. In 1896 he was invited to the United States as the Paddock lecturer at the General Seminary, New York. Back in Scotland he became involved in possible prayer book and canonical revision from 1894, and his work was to make an important posthumous contribution to eventual revision in 1912. In the latter part of his episcopate his scholarship brought recognition in Scotland, where he had been one of the founders of the Scottish History Society in 1886. The University of Edinburgh awarded him in 1904 an honorary LLD. An acknowledged authority in liturgical history, his <span class="italic">Scottish Communion Office, 1764</span> (1922) is still authoritative. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Scottish Historical Review</span> and wrote works on the medieval church history of Scotland, including <span class="italic">The Medieval Church in Scotland</span> (1910). Developing a later interest in Christian reunion, he was a regular attender at the meetings of the Christian Unity Association. Dowden died at his home, 13 Learmonth Terrace, Edinburgh, on 30 January 1910. His funeral was held in St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, from where he was buried in the Dean cemetery.<br>
