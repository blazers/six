<span class="headword">Casella,  Louis Pascal <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Luigi Pasquale]</span></span>  (1812&#150;1897), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born Luigi Pasquale Casella on 29 February 1812 in Edinburgh, the son of Pasquale Casella, teacher of painting, and his wife, who was a daughter of General Ramsay of Edinburgh. He was brought up and educated in Edinburgh, although nothing further seems to be known about his early life. About 1835 he moved to London, where he was employed by the instrument maker Caesar Tagliabue who, like Casella's father, had emigrated to Britain from near Como. On 5 November 1838 Casella married Caesar's daughter, Maria Louisa Tagliabue, who worked for the family firm in the office. In the same year Tagliabue took his son-in-law into partnership, changing the company's name to Tagliabue and Casella. In 1844, following Tagliabue's death, Casella took over the running of the firm, buying out the interests of his sister-in-law, Antonia Marina Tagliabue, in 1845.<br>
<br>At the time of Tagliabue's death, the firm was at Hatton Garden in the heart of London's scientific instrument making community. It was making and selling a variety of philosophical or scientific instruments, including thermometers, which became one of the main concerns of the firm under Casella's guidance. Its activities expanded considerably, and in 1848 Tagliabue was dropped from the company name. By the 1860s Casella &amp; Co. sold thermometers, hydrometers, and drawing and surveying instruments, as well as meteorological instruments and accessories for photography. Many of the devices were made in the Casella workshop, but some were made&#151;and engraved with Casella's name&#151;under contract by others, including the light engineers R. W. Munro of London and Thomas Cooke of York. Among the company's customers were the British and overseas governments, universities, and other scientific institutions. In 1872 Casella moved the firm, which had been in Hatton Garden for forty-four years, to Holborn Bars, where it stayed until after his death. By the time of the move, his two sons, Louis Marino and Charles Frederick, were working for the company.<br>
<br>As well as, or possibly as part of, pursuing his business interests, Casella maintained his contact with the scientific community through membership of learned societies. He was elected a member of the Meteorological Society of London in 1841 and became a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1862, by which time he had also joined the Royal Astronomical Society. One of his principal scientific interests was in meteorology and he received wide acclaim for his development and production of first-class meteorological instruments. He was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. The instruments for which Casella was most renowned were thermometers, and his name is associated with several designs, including a clinical thermometer based on the principle of the maximum thermometer, and the adaptation of a pressure gauge for the verification of thermometers to be used for determining deep-sea temperatures.<br>
<br>For most of his life Casella's company was profitable, and his family lived comfortably. In the mid-1870s a new family home, The Lawns, was built in Highgate, Middlesex, and in 1879 Casella bought a house for his daughter in neighbouring Finchley. However, during the 1890s the company went through some lean years, perhaps partly because of Casella's reluctance to loosen the reigns of control, despite his advancing years. On 29 February 1896 he celebrated his official twenty-first birthday, and a year later, on 23 April, he died from bronchitis at his home in Highgate. The firm, with its continuing problems, was left in the hands of his son, Charles Frederick.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_48371"></a><span class="headword">Charles Frederick Casella</span>  (1852&#150;1916), <span class="occ">manufacturer of scientific instruments</span>, was the younger son of Louis Pascal Casella and Maria Louisa Tagliabue. He was born in London on 25 February 1852. He was educated at Ushaw College, Durham, after which he spent time in Paris and at the university in Bonn. He was a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society and a member of the Society of Engineers and of the Physical Society.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1897 Charles Frederick was left in charge of the family business. Unfortunately, despite an interest in the instruments themselves, he lacked business acumen; he had inherited a company which was struggling and he was, for some years, unable to improve its situation. For a time there was confusion over the company name: formally it was changed to C. F. Casella, but leaflets, catalogues, and finished instruments continued to be issued under the name of L. P. Casella. By 1905, when the lease on the company's Holborn premises expired, affairs were in a poor state. The firm moved to cheaper but less convenient rooms in Westminster.<br>
<br>Having presided over the company's decline, Casella also oversaw its recovery, through two important appointments: Rowland Miall, an accomplished business manager, and Robert Abraham, who brought skills in engineering and some much needed capital. The three brought about a transformation; they formed a limited liability company in 1910, moved to new premises in south London in 1912, and launched a successful range of instruments. By the time of Charles's death from tuberculosis at his home, Kirkdale, 15 Spencer Road, Bournemouth, on 24 February 1916, Casellas was once more an instrument making company of renown.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_48370"></a><span class="headword">Louis Marino Casella</span>  (1842&#150;1923), <span class="occ">manufacturer of scientific instruments</span>, was born in London in 1842, the first son of Louis Pascal Casella and Maria Louisa Tagliabue. As a young man, Louis Marino joined his father's firm where he worked on the design of instruments, registering his first patent, for a mercurial minimum thermometer, in 1861. Louis maintained an interest in the firm throughout his father's lifetime and beyond but, following his father's death, his involvement was at arm's length. He kept his position as company director, but his own business interests took him in a different direction in manufacturing.<br>
<br>By the middle of the First World War, Louis Marino was chairman of D. Gilson &amp; Co., a firm making screws and turned parts. During the war the firms of Gilson and C. F. Casella crossed paths as the latter set up a new factory alongside Gilson in Walthamstow. In 1918, the Casella company fared better than its neighbour in reverting to peacetime production, and absorbed some of the production capacity abandoned by Louis Marino's organization. This led to a partial amalgamation of the two companies, a situation which prevailed when Louis Marino died, at his home, 47 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, on 28 July 1923, the last Casella to have direct involvement in the company.<br>
