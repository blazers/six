<span class="headword">Lumley,  John</span>, fifth Baron Lumley  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1492, <em>d.</em> 1545), <span class="occ">landowner and rebel</span>, of Lumley, co. Durham, was born in or before 1492, being at least eighteen in 1510. He was the son and heir of Richard Lumley, fourth Baron Lumley (<i>b</i>. in or before 1477, <i>d</i>. 1510), landowner, of Lumley, co. Durham, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1530), daughter of Sir John Conyers, of Hornby, North Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife, Alice. He succeeded his father, as fifth Baron Lumley, in May 1510 and received his first summons to parliament on 23 November 1514. Surprisingly, he did not take livery of his lands until 18 July 1515.<br>
<br>From his youth, Lumley followed the traditional chivalric ideals of the nobility. Indeed, members of his family aspired to the crusading values associated with the cult of St George. As such, Lumley participated in several military campaigns during the early years of Henry VIII's reign. He distinguished himself at the battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513 and was knighted on the field by Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey. In 1519 he participated in a raid to destroy fortresses in Scotland and was later involved in the Scottish campaign of 1522&#150;3, where he was mentioned in reports from the commander. More spectacularly, in June 1520 he accompanied Henry to France and was present at the Field of Cloth of Gold. In addition to his military exploits, Lumley participated in the administration of co. Durham, serving as JP. However, his relations with the early Tudor bishops of Durham were strained. In 1508 his father and he had been appointed, jointly, to the office of chief forester of Weardale, a position which had been held, in hereditary succession, by members of the Lumley family since 1436. Lumley's period of tenure was, however, punctuated by disputes with the episcopal administration, and his involvement in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536&#150;7 signalled the end of the family's long-standing connection with the office. The office of coroner of Chester Ward, which had likewise been in the family for several generations, was also granted to others. Dissatisfaction at the erosion of his traditional position within Durham society may well have been a factor in his later decision to rebel against the crown.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1530 Lumley signed the petition from the House of Lords calling on Clement VII to consent to the king's request for a divorce. He felt sufficiently at odds with royal policy in the north by the autumn of 1536 to take a rebel stance in the Pilgrimage of Grace. His Catholicism was probably a strong motivating factor too. As with many of the aristocratic pilgrims, Lumley claimed that he had been coerced into joining the revolt. He had been ordered by the king to raise 100 men to suppress the revolt. Instead, he played a leading role in it, adopting, in the process, an uncompromisingly hard-line approach in terms of rebel demands. Despite this, he came, subsequently, to accept the terms of the peace agreement, as one of their chief negotiators, drawn up at Doncaster in early December. While Lord Lumley avoided further involvement in the revolt, his eldest son and heir, <a href="#cosubject_17176">George Lumley [<i>see below</i>]</a> of Thwing in the East Riding of Yorkshire, was not so fortunate.<br>
<br>During the closing years of his life Lord Lumley suffered poor health, although he continued to play some part in public life, being appointed JP for the North Riding in 1539 and 1540. He was also summoned to sit in the parliament which met in January 1541. He concerned himself with local affairs and his estates during the last years. He died between 23 November and 16 December 1545 and was buried at Guisborough Priory, not far from his North Riding manor of Kilton. He had married Joan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1545), daughter of Henry Le Scrope, seventh Baron Scrope of Bolton, and his second wife, Mabel or Margaret. They had two sons, George and Percival Lumley. The few details about Percival are contained in the family papers; he married Elizabeth Hussey in 1543. Upon Lord Lumley's death his peerage was forfeited as a result of his heir's attainder. The Lumley estates, however, were settled upon his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17179/', "John Lumley, first Baron Lumley (c.1533&#150;1609)")</script>, the son and heir of George Lumley. In 1547 John Lumley successfully petitioned for the restoration of the barony.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17176"></a><span class="headword">George Lumley</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, had his marriage settled with Jane (<i>d</i>. in or after 1537), second daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Knightley of Upton and Fawsley, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Joan, on 20 May 1524. The couple were married before 1533 and had one son, John Lumley, and two daughters, Jane and Barbara. George Lumley became involved in the second phase of the Pilgrimage of Grace, led by Sir Francis Bigod in January 1537. He participated, with 400 men, in the capture of Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, which the rebels held for several days. He gave himself up on 20 January. As a result of this activity he was attainted and found guilty of high treason on 27 May. He wrote to his wife before his execution, &#145;good mother and natural to my three children, to whom I give God's blessing and mine&#146;, asking her to teach his heir to be a faithful servant to the king and a good Christian  (Milner, 30). He was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 2 June and buried in the Crutched Friars, London.<br>
