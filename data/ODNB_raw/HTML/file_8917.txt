<span class="headword">&AElig;thelstan</span> <span class="st"> [Ethelstan, &AElig;thelstan Half-King]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>932&#150;956), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second of four sons of Ealdorman &AElig;thelfrith, who ruled the southern and eastern territories of Mercia. &AElig;thelfrith was descended from the West Saxon royal family and held extensive estates in Somerset and Devon. His wife, &AElig;thelgyth, &AElig;thelstan's mother, came from a wealthy family with estates in Buckinghamshire. &AElig;thelfrith survived until about 915. Three years later the West Saxon royal house took over direct control of Mercia and under the new regime all of &AElig;thelfrith's four sons became ealdormen in the second quarter of the tenth century. &AElig;lfstan, the eldest, received his father's ealdordom but died in 934. &AElig;thelstan, created ealdorman in 932, took over the ancient kingdom of the East Angles, which had been ruled directly for forty years by the Danish king Guthrum and his successors until it came under the control of King Edward the Elder in 917&#150;18. Besides Norfolk and Suffolk, &AElig;thelstan's area of jurisdiction extended to practically the whole of the eastern Danelaw, from the Thames to the River Welland. It included Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire, plus the fenland territory that was later known as the Holland division of Lincolnshire. Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire may also have been under his control. In addition to all this&#151;a territory as large as Normandy&#151;&AElig;thelstan held extensive family estates outside his ealdordom, in Wessex and Mercia. His younger brother &AElig;thelwold was made ealdorman in 940 and held jurisdiction in Kent and the adjacent shires; he died in 946. &AElig;thelstan's youngest brother, Eadric, held the neighbouring ealdordom of central Wessex from 942 until his death in 949. By the mid-940s the three surviving brothers wielded immense power; between them they controlled well over half the extensive territories of the West Saxon kingdom. From 943 onwards &AElig;thelstan habitually witnessed first, and his brother &AElig;thelwold second among the <i>duces</i> (&#145;ealdormen&#146;) subscribing to royal charters; Eadric signed in third to sixth place until &AElig;thelwold's death, after which he was second only to &AElig;thelstan.<br>
<br>For the whole of his brief reign (939&#150;46), the young king Edmund remained strongly under the influence of his mother, Eadgifu, and of &AElig;thelstan, who between them must have decided much of royal policy. Nor was the position much changed when Edmund's brother Eadred succeeded, for Eadred's adult years were clouded by chronic illness and the responsibilities of &AElig;thelstan continued unabated. Moreover, from 944 onwards &AElig;thelstan and his wife, &AElig;lfwyn (<i>d</i>. 986), had fostered in their own household the infant atheling Edgar, a future king of England. In 949 &AElig;thelstan added to his responsibilities that of the governance of south-east Mercia, and from the end of 951 onwards that of central Mercia too. These territories, like all the other areas under his control, must have been governed by suffragans. He was also prominent in military affairs, helping King &AElig;thelstan and his successors gradually to secure control of territories under Danish occupation as far north as Strathclyde. Such deeds were remembered for a long time and in his eulogy on &AElig;thelstan over two centuries later a chronicler at Ramsey Abbey praised him because &#145;apud hostes patriae non nullam virtus bellica invidiam generavit&#146; (&#145;his warlike virtue aroused great dread among the enemies of the country&#146;; <span class="italic">Chronicon abbatiae Rameseiensis</span>, 11). The power exercised by &AElig;thelstan and his family can be compared only with that of Godwine's family a century later; it is no wonder that he was remembered in later years as the &#145;Half-King&#146;.<br>
<br>It is a measure of the Half-King's achievement that the eastern Danelaw remained in subjection to the West Saxon royal line, its inhabitants loyal and quiescent, throughout the period of his government. There is no mention of revolts, of collaboration with the Danes of northern England in subversive movements, or of encouragement of viking raiders along the eastern coastline. He brought the administration of the eastern Danelaw into line with the system operating in Wessex, English Mercia, and the south-east. In conformity with the rest of the kingdom, East Anglia was hidated and divided into hundreds, units of local government that persist to the present day. In matters of local interest, law, and custom the Danes were allowed a considerable measure of autonomy; but in national affairs, such as the control of the mints, the raising of the geld, and the provision of military service, the area was no less effectively governed than the rest of the territories subject to the English crown. In this &AElig;thelstan was helped by a group of subordinate Danish earls and English ealdormen scattered throughout his province. The beginning of East Anglian prosperity, so evident a century and a half later in <span class="roman">Little Domesday Book</span>, may fairly be credited to &AElig;thelstan's rule. Development of continental trade led to significant steps in the growth of Ipswich, Thetford, and Norwich.<br>
<br>&AElig;thelstan Half-King was a constant and powerful friend of the English church, both nationally and within his own ealdordom, where the conversion of the Danes was zealously consolidated, church building and endowment by landowners encouraged, and a diocesan framework reconstituted. His wife, &AElig;lfwyn, whom he must have married soon after receiving his ealdordom, was of undistinguished birth; she appears to have come from a Huntingdonshire family whose estates were destined to form the nucleus of the large endowment of Ramsey Abbey. It is probable that &AElig;thelstan's household, where Edgar was fostered, was centred somewhere in the neighbourhood. Perhaps it was at Upwood, on the edge of the fens, which is known to have been the home of his son and eventual successor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8919/', "&#198;thelwine")</script>.<br>
<br>The death of King Eadred on 23 November 955 led to a profound change in the circumstances, if not the fortunes, of the Half-King and his family. The new monarch, Eadwig, a youth of fifteen who appears to have been brought up in Wessex, commenced his reign inauspiciously by a major confrontation with Dunstan, then bishop of London and Worcester and a close friend of &AElig;thelstan. Eadwig disappeared from his coronation banquet and Dunstan found him, crown cast to one side, in a compromising situation with a lady named &AElig;lfgifu and her mother, &AElig;thelgifu, who were Eadwig's close relatives. Moreover, &AElig;thelgifu (whose husband has not been identified) was almost certainly &AElig;thelstan's sister. Dunstan remonstrated with the young Eadwig and brought him back forcibly to the banqueting hall. Shocked and humiliated by these developments, &AElig;thelstan supported Dunstan's action. Eadwig never forgave them. Dunstan was banished and the estates of Queen Eadgifu, Eadwig's grandmother and close associate of &AElig;thelstan, were confiscated. &AElig;thelstan himself, his power base shattered, resigned his ealdordom to his eldest son, &AElig;thelwold, in 956 or 957 and became a monk at Glastonbury, a house he had already endowed heavily with his family's west country estates while Dunstan had been abbot there. It is not known when &AElig;thelstan died. The fortunes of the family of the Half-King received only a temporary setback; the ealdordom passed from &AElig;thelwold to his brother &AElig;thelwine.<br>
