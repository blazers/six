<span class="headword">Thompson,  Charles Thurston</span>  (1816&#150;1868), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 28 July 1816, the second son of the wood-engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27271/', "John Thompson (1785&#150;1866)")</script> and his wife, Harriott Eaton. The outstanding feature of Thompson's career is that it was almost exclusively as an official photographer of works of art within the South Kensington Museum in London, the showcase of the Department of Science and Art. As such his career was inextricably linked with that of his friend Henry Cole, one of the key figures in the Victorian art world: Thompson was, in many respects, an acolyte to Cole's achievements.<br>
<br>Evidence suggests that Thompson initially followed his father's profession, and he is known to have produced engravings, some based on the designs of the artist John Thurston, after whom he may well have been given his second name. By early 1844 Thompson and Cole were working together on the sale of casts of the wooden blocks of the woodcut entitled the <span class="italic">Small Passion</span>, then attributed to Albrecht D&uuml;rer, which was housed in the print room of the British Museum. These casts may subsequently have been marketed by Cole's friend the art historian and publisher Joseph Cundall, who was a prominent figure in the promotion of photography in mid-Victorian England.<br>
<br>Comparatively little is known about Thompson's photographic career, and when it began, though the Great Exhibition of 1851 was the defining moment. In addition to his role as superintendent of class XXVI, furniture, and class XVIII, animal manufactures, he was placed in charge of all the photographic arrangements. Through this position he met the Paris-domiciled English photographer Robert Bingham (1825&#150;1870), who printed many of the photographs which appeared in the photographically illustrated special presentation copies of the <span class="italic">Reports by the Juries</span>. Bingham subsequently taught Thompson and in 1855 the two worked together to document the Paris Universal Exhibition on behalf of the Department of Science and Art.<br>
<br>Thompson was also intimately involved in the international exhibitions in London in 1862 and Paris in 1867. Commissioned to carry out both official and private photography and to record the construction of the 1862 building, he found himself criticized for having a conflict of interests in that he was not only a juror of class XIV photographs but also an exhibitor. For the Paris 1867 exhibition he helped select photographs for exhibition; his own exhibits, <span class="italic">Reproductions and Views in Spain and Portugal</span>, won him a silver medal. From 1853, and his first commission to photograph a loan exhibition of furniture at Gore House, London, until his death in 1868, he was the <i>de facto</i> official photographer of the Department of Science and Art and the South Kensington Museum. In July 1856 he was appointed superintendent of photography, though his first annual retainer seems to have been agreed only in 1859.<br>
<br>Thompson's photographic career within the Department of Science and Art was closely linked with the military through the Royal Engineers, with whom he had worked at the Great Exhibition of 1851. By 1853 sappers were being used at South Kensington as part of the unofficial yet permanent photographic facilities. This heavily subsidized photographic studio annoyed contemporary commercial photographers. Thompson gave photographic training to a stream of sappers and was paid 10 guineas when each soldier was granted a &#145;certificate of competency&#146;. As a direct result of this connection with the Royal Engineers, he travelled in 1854 and 1856 to northern France to photograph the military encampments of the French army. He married on 13 January 1857 Charlotte Jane Bond, daughter of William Bond; the couple had one daughter.<br>
<br>On his death it was estimated that Thompson had taken some 10,000 negatives of works of art. His photographs were widely disseminated and appeared in over twenty photographically illustrated publications, including catalogues of the South Kensington Museum. He documented the collections of the museum and temporary exhibitions held there; venturing further afield, he recorded works by Raphael for the project initiated by Prince Albert to document the artist's entire work. In 1858 he documented the Raphael cartoons at Hampton Court and copies of these photographs, available in five sizes, sold in significant numbers. In 1866 he undertook one of his most ambitious photographic projects when he travelled abroad for the Department of Science and Art and photographed in France, Spain, and Portugal. Selections of his Iberian images were published in 1868, on behalf of the Department of Science and Art, by the Arundel Society in volumes of the photographically illustrated series <span class="italic">Examples of Art Workmanship of Various Ages and Countries</span>.<br>
<br>Thompson carried out a limited amount of freelance commercial photography, selling photographs directly from a succession of private addresses in the Kensington area. In 1863 he was employed on several occasions by the Belgian art dealer Ernest Gambart to photograph paintings which Gambart was selling. In the following year he briefly collaborated with the amateur photographer Clementina, Viscountess Hawarden, in taking portraits.<br>
<br>Described by contemporaries as having &#145;a varied art culture [and] possessing a most discriminating taste and judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, 24 Jan 1868, 38), Thompson was &#145;modest and unassuming&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, 7 Feb 1868, 236) and did not actively court fame. He wrote neither books nor manuals on photography, and, although he exhibited photographs regularly in both national and international exhibitions, he was not a founder member of the Photographic Society of London; however, towards the end of his life he was elected a council member. Charles Thurston Thompson died on 20 January 1868 in the Hotel Meyerbeer, Paris, and was buried on 25 January at Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
