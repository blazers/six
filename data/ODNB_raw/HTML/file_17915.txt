<span class="headword">Man,  John</span>  (1514/15&#150;1569), <span class="occ">diplomat and dean of Gloucester</span>, was a fellow of New College, Oxford, but the presence of two men there of the same name (one from Essex, one from Wiltshire) has caused confusion. It would seem that Anthony Wood, who gives the dean's birth as 1512 at Lacock (alternatively Winterbourne Stoke), was wrong to identify him as the Wiltshire fellow. The latter entered Winchester College in 1523, took his BA in 1530 and his BCL in 1540, was principal of St Alban Hall (later absorbed by Jesus College) from 1548 to 1552, and died in 1565. The future dean, born at Letcombe in Berkshire but later resident at Writtle in Essex, entered Winchester in 1527 aged twelve, became a scholar of New College in 1531, BA and fellow in 1533, and MA in 1538. His knowledge of Italian might suggest that he travelled, but the question is obscure. <br>
<br>Senior proctor of the university in 1540, Man became prebendary of Biggleswade in Lincoln Cathedral in 1542, but was not ordained subdeacon until five years later, when he leased out the prebend for &pound;50 p.a. In 1549 he was made master of St Bartholomew's Hospital, Gloucester, &#145;although he be not of clerical orders and perhaps married&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1548&#150;9</i>, 244), later resigning the office to the city for a pension of &pound;38. Though he lived quietly during Mary's reign, suspicions concerning his religion caused him to lose his fellowship in 1553 and his prebend the following year. His retaining his fellowship that long suggests that it was then, rather than 1549, that he married Frances, daughter of Edmund Herenden (<i>d</i>. 1563), a London mercer whose will he witnessed in 1560. One of his children was old enough to accompany him to Spain in 1566.<br>
<br>Man had been restored to his Lincoln prebend by September 1560. A chaplain to Archbishop Matthew Parker, Man was nominated by the latter to the wardenship of Merton College, Oxford, on 27 May 1562, after disagreement among the fellows. His entry was opposed by the conservative sub-warden, William Hall, who (according to Wood) boxed Man's ears when the new warden gained entry. This was probably an over-dramatization: in Parker's account it was a servant who received the blow. Hall was expelled; other fellows, such as Roger Giffard, resigned. Man expressed gratitude to Parker by dedicating to him his popular translation of Wolfgang Musculus, <span class="italic">Commonplaces of Christian religion</span> (1563; repr. 1578). On 12 January 1566 Elizabeth named Man ambassador to Spain; to raise his status he was made dean of Gloucester three weeks later, apparently without any expectation of residence. Elizabeth allegedly punned that as Philip II &#145;had sent her a goose-man [Guzm&aacute;n de Silva], so she could not return the compliment better than by sending to him a man-goose&#146;  (Wood, 2.151). <br>
<br>Man thus followed the slightly old-fashioned pattern of the decanal diplomat. How he was thought to be qualified is obscure. The Catholic Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel, advertised him to Silva as &#145;a man of low position and small merits&#146;; Elizabeth, apparently calling him &#145;Curtene&#146;, as &#145;a worthy person who speaks Italian&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 525, 517). His verbatim quotations of Spanish utterances suggest that he could understand, if not necessarily speak, that language&#151;an ability perhaps uncommon among men Elizabeth could trust. Elizabeth later claimed, ludicrously, to have thought that Man was &#145;rather an adherent of the old religion than a protestant&#146; or, more reasonably (since he had not been a Marian exile), that he was &#145;a moderate in religion and had no love for the French&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 30, 33). However, he was associated not only with Archbishop Parker but (as Herenden's son-in-law) with the influential protestant coterie surrounding John Day and John Foxe in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate, London. <br>
<br>Greater administrative experience has been attributed to Man through identification with the John Man heavily involved in military finance, supply, and fortification from 1545. Some of this might seem rather out of the Oxonian's ambit, and the signature of John Man on the treasurer of the ordnance's accounts in 1547 does not resemble the ambassador's. More probably this John Man was the Lincolnshire gentleman to whom Mary confirmed leases of ex-monastic land on the grounds of service to the crown. Perhaps Robert Hogan, an English retainer of the count of Feria, confused two different men when he gibed that the ambassador had been &#145;overseer of labourers at Dover&#146; and was &#145;no gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 81). <br>
<br>Man arrived in Bilbao in March 1566; proceeding to Madrid he found the papal nuncio (and future Pope Urban VII) Gianbattista Castagna and others watching for indiscretions, which he was not slow to commit. The hostile Hogan complained Man did &#145;but dishonour the queen and shame the country&#146; and seemed &#145;to be meeter to sow sedition than to maintain amity, he is of so simple a judgement and small understanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1566&#150;8</i>, 417). Philip II came to describe him as not so much &#145;<i>embajador</i>&#146; as &#145;<i>perturbador</i>&#146;  (Gonzales, 84), accusing him of circulating protestant literature. Man himself traced his problems to &#145;the exceeding hatred of the Conte di Feria&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Galba Cii, fol. 146<i>r</i>), resulting from his intervention in the count's quarrel with Arundel over the financial affairs of his English in-laws. Elizabeth agreed that Man had been the victim of malice. <br>
<br>It seems to have been Man's own idea early in his embassy to request religious freedom like that granted to Spanish ambassadors in England, for his household as well as himself. His petition was refused, albeit without arousing particular outrage among the Spanish, but things were different by January 1568, when Elizabeth officially supported his request for free protestant worship, against a background of religious tension provoked by the situation in the Netherlands. In any case Man finally disabled himself from diplomatic function in Spain by calling the pope &#145;a canting little monk&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 29). In June Elizabeth yielded to pressure for his recall but only after Philip II, not content with subjecting Man to loud prayers for England's conversion under his window, expelled him from Madrid to the village of Barajas. <br>
<br>Philip explained that he had no choice in questions of &#145;offence to God Almighty&#146;. &#145;Nobody had been in fault except the ambassador himself&#146;, who &#145;richly deserved to be burnt at the stake&#146;; Philip hoped for a replacement who would &#145;avoid similar occurrences&#146; and indeed in 1575 was still suggesting reversion to &#145;the same order of things as had always existed before the time of John Man&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 30&#150;31, 59, 510). His reaction to Man's indiscretions may have been over-demonstrative, but (as he was still disinclined to offend Elizabeth) it was probably not just &#145;a ploy&#146;  (Bell, &#145;Man&#146;, 88). It was an English decision, not a Spanish requirement, that no replacement for Man as resident was sent. Meanwhile Man was cited as a precedent justifying successive expulsions of Spanish ambassadors from England. <br>
<br>The Spanish and English governments may have used the Man d&eacute;b&acirc;cle to test each other, but it had not occurred without personal ineptitude on his part. It is hard to see him as &#145;conscientious and competent&#146;  (Bell, &#145;Man&#146;, 93). Castagna even claimed that he was &#145;rather touched in the head&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Rome</span>, <i>1558&#150;71</i>, 272). Man apparently returned broken in health (which encouraged later reports of Spanish mistreatment): his journey absorbed the large sum of &pound;276 2<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., which included provision of a litter from London to Windsor. He seems not to have returned to Merton, where Parker had repeatedly had to enforce order in his absence. He died apparently intestate in the London house of his mother-in-law, Millicent Herenden, on 18 March 1569, and was buried in the chancel of St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate. His widow remarried: in 1581, as Frances Stauntonne, she received &pound;20 in her mother's will. Mrs Herenden also left &pound;20 to William Man, presumably Frances's son from her first marriage.<br>
