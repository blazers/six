<span class="headword">Varley,  Henry</span>  (1835&#150;1912), <span class="occ">evangelist</span>, was born on 25 October 1835 in Tattershall, Lincolnshire, the youngest of four sons and seven children of John Varley, brewer and maltster, of Tattershall, and his wife, Mary. He was educated at Lincoln until his mother's death in 1845 and then attended a boarding-school in Kibworth, Leicestershire (1845&#150;6). At the age of eleven he went to London to work, eventually becoming a butcher employed by Thomas Pickworth, a staunch Calvinist. In 1851 Varley, whose mother had been a devout Anglican evangelical, experienced an evangelical conversion through the preaching of Baptist W. Noel, a well-known Baptist minister. He was baptized as a believer and joined Noel's church. In 1854 he emigrated to Australia where his early hopes as a gold-digger were disappointed, but where he prospered as a butcher near Melbourne, buying his own business in Geelong in 1855. On returning to England in 1857 he married, on 20 October, Sarah Pickworth, the third daughter of his former employer, and established himself as a successful butcher in Notting Hill, London.<br>
<br>Varley's business success was soon eclipsed by his evangelistic preaching; his rapport with the working poor led him to establish a church for his converts. In 1860 Varley and Thomas Pickworth each gave &pound;1100 to build a tabernacle in Notting Hill, which accommodated 1000 people. Varley was its unpaid minister until 1882 and experimented with various means of evangelizing and meeting the social needs of the poor. Particularly original among these was the annual Butcher's Festival. His ideas had a significant influence on the American evangelist D. L. Moody in 1867 and later in 1872. Varley often preached for C. H. Spurgeon and, like Spurgeon, declined ordination; unlike Spurgeon he refused to be identified as a Baptist. Many of his associates thought him close to the Open Brethren. In 1869 he sold his business and began preaching throughout Britain. In 1874 he toured Canada and the United States. This was the first of a series of overseas crusades: Australia and New Zealand (1876&#150;8), America (1884), Cape Colony (1886), and Australia (1886&#150;8). In 1888 he settled in Melbourne for health reasons but continued to travel widely, preaching repeatedly in Britain as well as in Singapore (1891), India (1892&#150;3), America (1893&#150;4, 1895, 1897&#150;9, 1901&#150;2), Canada (1897, 1898), Norway (1903), and Germany (1903).<br>
<br>Varley was one of a number of itinerant lay evangelists who emerged after the 1858&#150;9 religious revival. Gradually his sermons moved away from emotional appeals to more reasoned ones; in this he had much in common with such British &#145;gentleman evangelists&#146; of his day as Brownlow North. His preaching reflected emphases then popular with British evangelicals: the controversial Holiness teaching promoted by the Keswick Convention, anti-Catholicism, temperance, opposition to Anglo-Catholic ritualism, and vehement campaigns against international prostitution rings. Varley embraced premillennialism, which reinforced his pessimistic view of the direction of Victorian society. He was fearless in his attacks on public figures whose actions he considered unconscionable. Varley was also known for his purity lectures, aimed at making men serious, sober, and sexually abstemious. He wrote many religious tracts and books, of which <span class="italic">The Evangel of the Risen Christ</span> and <span class="italic">Christ's Coming Kingdom</span> (3rd edn, 1893) had a notable success. Varley died at the Belvedere Mansion Hotel, 61 King's Road, Brighton, on 30 March 1912, and was buried in Brighton extra-mural cemetery on 4 April. He was survived by six sons and two daughters.<br>
