<span class="headword">Beloe,  Robert</span>  (1905&#150;1984), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born in Winchester on 12 May 1905, the eldest of the four sons (there were no daughters) of the Revd Robert Douglas Beloe (1868&#150;1931), headmaster of Bradfield College, Berkshire, and his wife, (Margaret) Clarissa, the daughter of the Revd Prebendary John Trant Bramston, of Winchester College. Throughout his life his career was marked by the twin interests of education and the Church of England. He was educated at Winchester College and at Hertford College, Oxford, where he obtained a second-class honours degree in modern history in 1927.<br>
<br>There followed a brief apprenticeship in teaching&#151;at his father's old school, then at Eton, and finally (as some preparation for the very different realities of popular education) at an elementary school in Reading. Beloe married in 1933 Amy, daughter of Captain Sir Frank Stanley Di Rose, second baronet, with whom he had a son and two daughters. In 1931 he had joined the ranks of educational administration as a trainee in Kent, and three years later he was promoted to Surrey, to which the central twenty-five years of his career were devoted. In 1939 he became deputy education officer, and one year later chief education officer.<br>
<br>Beloe was therefore well placed to become a central member of that significant group of chief education officers who were responsible for putting into effect, in the years after the Second World War, the provisions of the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944 designed by R. A. Butler. The two decades during which Beloe presided over the provision of public education in Surrey represented the high-water mark of the influence of enlightened administrators working amicably with elected councillors. Such influence by local government officers was to be much eroded in the closing decades of the twentieth century. He was among the first to make detailed plans for the expansion of secondary education, which required both the abolition of all fees for secondary school pupils and the provision of secondary education for all pupils over the age of eleven.<br>
<br>The urgent requirements of expansion and building, the traditional respect in which the county grammar school had been held since the act of 1902, and the prevailing orthodoxies inherited from the 1930s made it inevitable that the majority of secondary school pupils would be directed into secondary modern schools while the more academic minority would enjoy the undoubtedly superior provision of the grammar schools. Surrey was rich in such schools. Beloe's own preference was for a form of common or comprehensive schooling for pupils between the ages of eleven and thirteen, at which point more definitive choices could more appropriately be made. Although this preference did not prevail, he did ensure&#151;as educational expectations and performance rose&#151;that good opportunities for some of the pupils excluded from the grammar schools were provided within the secondary modern schools. Socially and economically Surrey was a well-favoured area, and the development of the bilateral school (essentially a secondary modern school with a grammar school stream within it) was a distinctive mark of Beloe's years in that county.<br>
<br>Such a development, in a county warily suspicious of innovation, furnished a natural bridge to the more dramatic growth of comprehensive schooling which was to be so pronounced a feature of the educational history of the 1960s. Beloe himself had little interest in some of the more ambitious claims made for comprehensive education, and little sympathy with their ideological roots. His concern was for the individual (pupil or teacher or colleague) and with the extension to him or her of the advantages enjoyed by those who came, like himself, from a privileged background.<br>
<br>One measure of these advantages in post-war Britain was access to an appropriate public examination attesting educational success for those pupils choosing to stay on at school for at least one extra year beyond what was at that time the legally imposed school-leaving age. Beloe's introduction of the GCE (general certificate of education, as it had been constituted in 1951) into the secondary modern schools of Surrey was an index of the determination of parents, teachers, and pupils to enlarge the scope of that examination. It was nevertheless acknowledged that the GCE had weaknesses, which became more obvious as it was opened to less academic pupils.<br>
<br>Beloe had been a member since 1947 of the Secondary Schools Examination Council, the national body then responsible for policy on such matters, and it was therefore particularly appropriate that in 1958 he should be appointed chairman of a committee of that council charged with reviewing the provision of school examinations. The Beloe report of 1960 enjoys a place in educational history and led to the introduction five years later of the certificate of secondary education (CSE) which was intended to meet the needs of pupils across a wide range of ability. That examination was designed to be determined by the curriculum provided in each school, to be controlled very largely by teachers, and to provide an acceptable alternative to the GCE. Its success and popularity created problems&#151;inherent in the provision of two separate examinations for sixteen-year-old pupils&#151;and in 1988 (fifteen years after the minimum school-leaving age had been raised to sixteen) the two examinations were merged in the general certificate of secondary education (GCSE). The CSE, the principal national monument to Beloe's career, represented an important transition and epitomized many of the liberal values of the decade in which it was born.<br>
<br>In 1959 Beloe, to the surprise of many, was appointed as the (first) lay secretary to the archbishop of Canterbury. In that discreet capacity he served for ten years two archbishops, G. F. Fisher and A. M. Ramsey. He was appointed CBE in 1960 and was made in 1979 an honorary DCL of the University of Kent. He was a member of many committees and other bodies, including the royal commission on marriage and divorce (1951&#150;5). His recreations included travel and gardening. Beloe died at his home, the Hill House, Queens Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 26 April 1984. He was survived by his wife.<br>
