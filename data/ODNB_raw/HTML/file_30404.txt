<span class="headword">Anderson, Sir  Alan Garrett</span>  (1877&#150;1952), <span class="occ">public servant and shipowner</span>, was born in London on 9 March 1877, the only son of James George Skelton Anderson and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30406/', "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1836&#150;1917)")</script>, the first woman to qualify as a doctor in Great Britain. He had two sisters, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62050/', "Louisa Garrett Anderson")</script>, was a noted suffragette and surgeon. A scholar at Eton College from 1890 to 1895 (and later a governor), Anderson went to Trinity College, Oxford (where he was later an honorary fellow), in 1896. He left in his second year to fulfil a promise to enter Anderson, Anderson &amp; Co., the family shipping business, when his father needed him. The call came in 1897 on the death of his great-uncle, James Anderson, the founder of this London shipbroking business. J. G. Skelton Anderson and his associate Frederick Green jointly formed the Orient Steam Navigation Company in 1877, and managed its passenger and cargo service between Britain and Australia.<br>
<br>As a boy Anderson visited Australia with his parents; in 1900 he went again as a partner in Anderson, Anderson &amp; Co., and spent two years there. With unremitting competition worldwide, and severe droughts in Australia between 1895 and 1904, Orient Line had twice to combine with others to avoid bankruptcy. But in 1910, the line shared in the unprecedented prosperity in the shipping industry, and, with good seasons and substantial support from the commonwealth, was able to stand alone.<br>
<br>Government service and heavy losses during the 1914&#150;18 war made it difficult for small shipping companies to survive. In 1919, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P. &amp; O.), which had always worked closely with the Orient Line, bought a controlling interest in it, and its two original companies were merged into Anderson, Green &amp; Co. This reorganization took place under the aegis of James Lyle Mackay, the first earl of Inchcape. He had a high regard for Anderson and brought him on to the boards of P. &amp; O. and British India Steam Navigation Company (BI), another large company in the P. &amp; O. group. Anderson had already spread his business interests: he became a director of the Midland Railway Company (1911&#150;23), and of the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway from 1923, when this company was formed.<br>
<br>During the First World War Anderson's services to the government were manifold. Under Walter Runciman (1870&#150;1949), president of the Board of Trade, he was involved with blockades and claims (while the USA was neutral) that arose from treating as contraband cargoes in American vessels consigned to the enemy. His next task, as vice-chairman of the royal commission for wheat supplies, was to set up a wheat executive to control the distribution of grain among the western allies; and as soon as the USA entered the war, he accompanied Arthur Balfour on a mission to Washington, DC, to help establish the marketing of wheat in the United States and Canada. His appointment as Admiralty controller, dealing with both the Royal Navy and the merchant navy, was the last of these important national and international engagements for which, in 1917, he was made a KBE and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and received an honour from the Italian king.<br>
<br>Although Anderson had looked forward to returning to his shipping business after the war, demands for his business acumen and efficiency came from many quarters. He chaired two government inquiries, one on the training of naval officers, the other on the pay of civil servants, and was a member of the royal commission on national debt.<br>
<br>Anderson was elected to the board of the Bank of England in 1918, and although he professed that he knew nothing about banking, the governor, Montagu Norman (1871&#150;1950), thought otherwise, and chose him as the next deputy governor. At the end of 1924, before Anderson had entered this office, Norman took him to New York to discuss the imminent return of the UK to the gold standard. The decision was announced a few weeks after he became deputy governor.<br>
<br>Anderson retired in 1926, before the end of the normal two year period of service. There was no sign that Norman was about to retire; and he did not allow his deputy to show his talents, for fear that his own authority might be discredited. However, Anderson remained an ordinary director of the bank until 1946. His colleagues appreciated his freshness of outlook and shrewd judgement. His stature in the wider shipping world was recognized when he was selected to sit on the board of the Suez Canal Company (1927&#150;52) as one of its British directors. He was made a GBE in 1934.<br>
<br>In 1935 Anderson reluctantly agreed to stand for parliament to represent the City of London; he was returned unopposed twice more, but did not like the atmosphere in the House of Commons and resigned in 1940 to concentrate on war work. He chaired the cereals control board as soon as the war began, and in 1941 became head of the railway executive and controller of railways, holding these posts until 1945.<br>
<br>Anderson had a special interest in bringing shipowners together to resolve their problems amicably. Using his presidency of the chamber of shipping in Britain as a stepping stone, he was instrumental in the formation of the international chamber of commerce and played an outstanding part in its development, serving successively as vice-president, president, and honorary life president. His experience led him to become one of the earliest post-war &#145;Europeans&#146;, seeking a future in which some form of political unity could be constructed among all European countries. At a conference in Lisbon in the summer of 1951, where he made his last major speech, he spoke of his vision: a Europe without closed borders or national jealousies.<br>
<br>Anderson's greatest interest outside the shipping industry was the Royal Free Hospital and the London School of Medicine for Women, both of which were his mother's creations. He was their treasurer, and in the inter-war years, he organized various fund-raising schemes for London's hospitals. He was also a trustee of the Seamen's Pension Fund. He was a deputy lieutenant for the City of London and high sheriff of the county of London in 1922.<br>
<br>Anderson married Muriel Ivy, daughter of G. W. Duncan of Richmond, Surrey, in 1903. They had two sons, the younger of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45480/', "Sir Donald Forsyth Anderson (1906&#150;1973)")</script>, became prominent in the shipping world, and two daughters. In his spare time he was a keen oarsman and sportsman: his love of sailing began in the waters around Aldeburgh, Suffolk (his mother's family home). His favourite relaxation in later life was to sail his own yacht, often going in it to shipping conferences in European ports. Tall and vigorous, he was said to have had a magnetic personality and a fine sense of humour, and his capacity to absorb details without forgetting their wider context was formidable. He was impatient with colleagues if their minds did not work as quickly as his, but he was always ready to admit a mistake.<br>
<br>Anderson died at 20 Devonshire Place, London, on 4 May 1952, and was survived by his wife.<br>
