<span class="headword">Morris,  William O'Connor</span>  (1824&#150;1904), <span class="occ">judge and historian</span>, was born in Kilkenny city, Ireland, on 26 November 1824, the son of Benjamin Morris (<i>d</i>. 1846), sometime rector of Rincurran in the diocese of Cork and Cloyne, and Elizabeth, youngest daughter and coheir of Maurice Nugent O'Connor of Gartnamona, near Tullamore, King's county. Morris was educated at a private school at Epsom (1837&#150;41) and under the rector of Laugharne in south Wales (1841&#150;3). On 15 June 1843 he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, and in 1844 he was elected a scholar. He left university for a year and a half because of financial difficulties at home during the height of the great famine (1846&#150;7), but resumed his studies in 1847 and graduated BA in 1848. His father had died in 1846.<br>
<br>Despite early thoughts of a military career, Morris entered the King's Inns, Dublin, as a law student in 1851. On 30 April 1852 he was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn, London, and was called to the Irish bar in early spring 1854. He chose the home circuit and by 1862 had been elected a professor of common and criminal law at King's Inns. The following year he was appointed a commissioner to investigate the rights of owners of fixed nets for salmon in Ireland. However, owing to a difference of opinion with Robert Peel, then chief secretary, he was compelled to resign. Meanwhile, on 16 March 1858, Morris married Georgina Lindsay (<i>d</i>. 1910), and he established himself at Blackrock, co. Dublin, having also inherited, through his advantageous marriage, the property of Gartnamona. They had five daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Morris began to contribute articles on historical, legal, social, and political subjects to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, whose editor, Henry Reeve, had become a friend. He also reviewed books, mainly on his favourite subject, military history, for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. As a landlord Morris paid close attention to the conditions of land tenure in Ireland, and he was asked by John Thadeus Delane, the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, to contribute a special series of articles on the land question, which had been made topical by Gladstone's determination to engage with Irish problems. Morris's letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which advocated the legal recognition of tenant right in Ulster, attracted attention, and the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1870, though not entirely to his satisfaction, drew upon many of his ideas.<br>
<br>In 1869&#150;70 Morris served on a commission to inquire into the corrupt practices surrounding the election of freemen of the city of Dublin, and in 1872 he was appointed county court judge for the county of Louth. Six years later he was transferred to co. Kerry. Morris found co. Kerry much less agreeable than Louth, since he was utterly opposed to the home rule movement there, which was accompanied by rural violence. He disapproved of the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1881, which he administered, and never lost an opportunity of denouncing it. He reduced rents by 15 to 20 per cent on well-managed estates and by 30 to 40 per cent on badly managed ones, but he refused to submit to local opinion. In 1880 he moved with his family from Dublin to Gartnamona, and was, at his own request, transferred in 1886 to the county judgeship of the united counties of Sligo and Roscommon. His position there was easier, but his attitude towards recent Irish legislation and his unsympathetic treatment of the de Freyne tenants in 1901 led to his being bitterly criticized.<br>
<br>Morris then buried himself in his writing, publishing historical works which served as a welcome distraction, such as <span class="italic">Hannibal &hellip; and the Crisis of the Struggle between Carthage and Rome</span> (1890), <span class="italic">Napoleon &hellip; and the Military Supremacy of Revolutionary France</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">Moltke: a Biographical and Critical Study</span> (1893). He examined the Irish past in works such as <span class="italic">Ireland from 1494 to 1868</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Ireland from '98 to '98</span> (1898), and <span class="italic">Present Irish questions</span> (1901); and he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Memories and Thoughts of a Life</span>, in 1895. Morris died at Gartnamona on 3 August 1904, and was survived by his wife.<br>
