<span class="headword">Caddy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tompson]</span>,  Florence</span>  (1836/7&#150;1923), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London, the only child of John Charles Tompson, officer in the commissariat, and his French wife. J. M. Gullick suggests that, after his early death, the young Florence lived in France with her mother, but that when her mother died shortly afterwards she was returned to England to the care of various guardians, including a severe low-church family who made her childhood rather bleak. She was educated in England and abroad, notably at Paris, D&uuml;sseldorf, and Athens. On 29 January 1857 at the Catholic Apostolic Church, Gordon Square, London, she married John Turner Caddy (1821/2&#150;1902), naval surgeon, who came from a Devon family and trained at Guy's Hospital and Aberdeen University, serving thirty-one years at sea and later at Falmouth and Bristol. The marriage seems to have been happy: she commended in print the marriage of young girl and older, experienced man, and she and her husband had five children: John (<i>b</i>. 1858), Florence (<i>b</i>. 1862), Arnold (<i>b</i>. 1866), Hermione (<i>b</i>. 1869), and Adrian (<i>b</i>. 1879). Dr Caddy retired in 1876 as deputy inspector-general of hospitals and fleets and, though he had a pension and sought to establish a medical practice in west London, the family income was depleted at a time when the children's calls on it were growing.<br>
<br>Mrs Caddy turned to writing: her first published work, <span class="italic">Household Organisation</span> (1877), pointed to straitened circumstances with its stress on economy and insistence that there was no work unfit for a lady. She tried her hand at novel-writing with <span class="italic">Artist and Amateur</span> (3 vols., 1878) and <span class="italic">Adrian Bright</span> (3 vols., 1883) and revisited her earlier genre in <span class="italic">Lares and Penates</span> (1881), with its homilies and reflections. <span class="italic">Footsteps of Jeanne d'Arc</span> (1886) was an interesting experiment to assess &#145;the value of the geographical treatment of history&#146;  (p. 372), since she felt &#145;much might be gained by treating history geographically&#146;  (ibid., x). Her idea was to prepare by reading histories and biographies of Jeanne d'Arc, but to write as a traveller, visiting the places Jeanne had visited and writing with an immediacy that their common surroundings would bring. This commendable aim sadly resulted in a book that, although it avoided dullness, did not avoid superficiality.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Through the Fields with Linnaeus</span> (2 vols., 1887) followed a similar method, although Mrs Caddy seems to have followed her subject only to Sm&aring;land in 1886. A reviewer's remark that &#145;Mrs Caddy has thoughts upon many things entirely unconnected with botany &hellip; and she expresses them as they arise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Spectator</span>, 60, 1218, cited in Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>) is unkind, as the book is not intended as pure biography, still less pure botany. However, the extracts from Linnaeus's diary that she commendably reproduced stand out from her prose for their conciseness, pertinence, and clarity. Mrs Caddy described Linnaeus's classification as a &#145;natural method&#146; of classification, though his sexual system stands in contradistinction to Jussieu's natural system. She was sympathetic to the Scandinavians, but her observations lack penetration: visiting Sm&aring;land, a region of Sweden from which poverty was to drive thousands to the United States, she remarked &#145;there appear to be no poor people&#146;  (F. Caddy, <span class="italic">Through the Fields with Linnaeus</span>, 1887, 1.5). Though Gullick considers it her best book, <span class="italic">To Siam and Malaya</span> (1889) shows the same lack of curiosity and insight on Caddy's part about the rather little-known places she visited aboard the duke of Sutherland's yacht <i>Sans peur</i> (she had previously sailed in the yacht to the Baltic).<br>
<br>This was Caddy's last book, the calls on family finances by this time being greatly reduced. When her husband died in 1902 the family was living at The Charterhouse, Richmond, Surrey. Mrs Caddy subsequently set up home with her unmarried daughter Hermione in London and the west country until her death at her home, 7 Albemarle Villas, Stoke, Devonport, Devon, on 9 July 1923.<br>
<br>Mrs Caddy thought herself something of a scholar: there is no trace of irony in her statement of her appointment as botanist and naturalist to the trip to the Far East (though it seems much more likely that she was brought along to give respectability to the party, whose &#145;Lady Clare&#146; was Mary Caroline Blair (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mitchell), later the duke's controversial second wife). Her prefaces stress the thoroughness of her preparatory research and the fresh insights she will give into her subjects' lives: yet if this learning was genuine, it is well masked in her books. The blend of biographical, topographical, and historical writing that characterizes her two most important works, <span class="italic">Jeanne d'Arc</span> and <span class="italic">Linnaeus</span>, was a well-established formula which had found a ready audience with a reading public that included an increasing number of actual or future tourists. Though she aimed higher than many such authors and travelled further than most, she never consistently rose above the trivial, though her last book was considered worthy of reprint in 1992.<br>
