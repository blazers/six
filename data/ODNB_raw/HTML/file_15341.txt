<span class="headword">Keymis <span class="st"> [Kemys]</span>,  Lawrence</span>  (1564/5&#150;1618), <span class="occ">mariner and explorer</span>, was born in Wiltshire and entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1581 at the age of sixteen. He graduated BA in 1584 and held a junior bursarship in 1585&#150;6, when his admission of liability for unpaid bills and uncollected battels amounting to over &pound;34 was noted. Part of this was still unpaid when the authorities initiated legal proceedings against him in 1591&#150;2, by which time he had evaded them by taking service with Walter Ralegh and Thomas Harriot, his Oxford contemporaries. Keymis became one of Ralegh's most loyal supporters. He accompanied Ralegh on his first visit to Guiana in 1595, which from local information seemed to offer the prospect of reaching the fabled lake Parima and its source of much gold. Ralegh did discover a source of gold among quartz rocks, but realized that this was too difficult to work, and that he needed to find alluvial gold or some softer deposit.<br>
<br>Ralegh's second expedition to the New World consisted of two ships that sailed under Keymis in January 1596 with orders to explore the rivers north of the Amazon delta. Keymis sailed along the coast of Guiana, noted the sizes of the river mouths and the tribes and languages he encountered, and was attracted by reports of a vast lake at the head of the Essequibo. He then entered the Orinoco and proceeded upstream to the Caroni River, where he found a small Spanish settlement, San Tom&eacute;, and an ambush defending the passage upriver where on his previous expedition Ralegh had located gold-bearing quartz. Having no armed force, Keymis was obliged to retreat. The only prospect of success, which he conveyed optimistically to Ralegh on his return, was the story of alluvial gold to be found at the foot of Iconuri, a mountain some 15 miles distant.<br>
<br>A long period then elapsed, during which Ralegh was imprisoned in the Tower. In the search for evidence against him Keymis was also detained for some eighteen weeks, first in the Tower, then in the Fleet. Ralegh urged his own release so that he and Keymis might return to Guiana to locate the sources of gold, but he obtained his liberty only in 1616, and was instructed to behave peaceably to the Spanish settlers. His fleet sailed in 1617, and, while Ralegh remained at the mouth of the Orinoco with most of his ships, Keymis set off upriver in December with 250 soldiers and 150 sailors in five vessels. Three reached San Tom&eacute;, which consisted of some thirty houses surrounded by a rampart and moat. On the night of 2&#150;3 January 1618 a party under Ralegh's son Walter marched towards the rampart. Firing broke out, Walter led a charge into the settlement, and was killed in the ensuing conflict. This assault was a violation of Ralegh's instructions, but it is unclear whether Keymis had decided that San Tom&eacute; must be destroyed before he could search for the mines, or, perhaps more likely, whether the defending Spaniards suspected treachery and fired first.<br>
<br>Keymis then lost his resolve: he alone knew where the mines were said to be, but more than twenty years had passed since his earlier visit. Afraid to let his men witness his failure, while George Ralegh led a party several hundred miles up the Orinoco, Keymis searched for the supposed mines with a few friends, and one night brought back some ore. This, when tested by a refiner, proved worthless. His excursions upriver were resisted by the Spaniards, and he made no effort to reach the alluvial gold at the foot of Iconuri. Eventually he gave up; the plunder from San Tom&eacute; was loaded onto the ship and the settlement fired. The ships hastily made their way downriver, fearful lest a larger Spanish force should pursue them, and reached Ralegh's base on 2 March. Keymis had already sent word to Ralegh informing him of the attack on San Tom&eacute; and the death of his son; he now had to admit his failure to locate the sources of gold. Ralegh, fully aware of the implications of these events, confronted him with the bitter statement that Keymis had ruined him by his actions, and refused to support the latter in his report to the English backers. Keymis left Ralegh's cabin, saying that he knew what action to take, and went back to his ship. Ralegh then heard a pistol shot, and sent his servant to enquire what was happening, to which Keymis, lying on his bed, replied that he was just discharging a previously loaded pistol. Half an hour later Keymis's boy entered the cabin and found him dead. The ball had only grazed a rib, and after Ralegh's servant had left he stabbed himself to the heart with a long knife. Keymis was unmarried and left his estate to his younger brother Nathaniel.<br>
