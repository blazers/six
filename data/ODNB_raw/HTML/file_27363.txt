<span class="headword">Thornton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1767?, <em>d.</em> 1814), <span class="occ">writer on Turkey</span>, was the son of William Thornton, a Yorkshireman settled in London and working as an innkeeper. He was probably the Thomas Thornton who was baptized on 29 December 1767 at St Peter Cornhill, London, the son of William and Dorothy Thornton. That couple also had a son Edward baptized on 16 November 1766; the latter may be identified as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27353/', "Sir Edward Thornton (1766&#150;1852)")</script>, who is known to have been Thomas's brother. Thomas was the uncle of Sir Edward Thornton (1817&#150;1906).<br>
<br>Thornton was left orphaned when young and engaged in commerce from an early age. About 1793 he was sent to the British factory at Constantinople, where he lived for fourteen years; he also stayed for fifteen months in Odessa and paid occasional visits to Asia Minor and the islands of the archipelago. While at Constantinople and before 14 July 1799 he married Sophie Zohrab, the daughter of a Greek merchant and a member of a powerful family well connected in the Middle East, with whom he had a large family. His youngest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27367/', "William Thomas Thornton (1813&#150;1880)")</script>.<br>
<br>After his return to England Thornton published in <span class="italic">The Present State of Turkey</span> (1807) a brief summary of Ottoman history and a detailed and comprehensive account of the political and social institutions of the Turkish empire; a second edition, revised and improved, was published in two volumes in 1809. Thornton had gleaned his information from living so long at Constantinople, from his friendship with the European ambassadors, from his extensive reading of previous works, and from his facility in languages. His account was hailed as &#145;by far the best book ever published on that country&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 84/1, 1814, 418). Thornton was sympathetic towards Turks, who he felt had been unjustly disparaged by previous authors. He severely criticized William Eton's <span class="italic">Survey of the Turkish Empire</span> (1798), and drew from Eton in reply <span class="italic">A letter to the earl of D&hellip; on the political relations of Russia in regard to Turkey, Greece, and France</span> (1807).<br>
<br>About the end of 1813 Thornton was appointed consul to the Levant Company, but on 28 March 1814, on the eve of setting out for Alexandria, he died, &#145;of a pulmonary complaint&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 84/1, 1814, 418), at Burnham, Buckinghamshire.<br>
