<span class="headword">Emes,  William</span>  (1729/30&#150;1803), <span class="occ">landscape designer and gardener</span>, whose early life is obscure, took up the post of head gardener to Sir Nathaniel Curzon at Kedleston, Derbyshire, on 8 September 1756. He remained there until 1760, perhaps leaving his post because the appointment of Robert Adam with &#145;the intire manadgement of his Grounds&#146; left Emes with little scope. While at Kedleston he had already started altering the earlier, formal landscape and had made the upper lake. On 17 December 1758 Emes, then twenty-eight, married his servant Mary (<i>d</i>. 1789), the daughter of John Innocent, a tailor. They had five sons and three daughters. One son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8788/', "John Emes (1762&#150;1808)")</script>, was an artist and engraver, but later became better known, with his wife, Rebecca, as a goldsmith.<br>
<br>Emes moved to Bowbridge Fields, Mackworth, a farmhouse about 2 miles from Kedleston. He developed an extensive practice as a landscape designer (ninety commissions are known), largely in the north midlands and Wales. His style is similar to that of Lancelot &#145;Capability&#146; Brown, although there is no evidence that he ever worked with Brown, and at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, in 1763, Lord Grosvenor called Emes in to replace Brown. The elegant plans, in Indian ink on vellum, which he presented to his clients showed his proposed alterations to the landscape&#151;often with serpentine lakes whose ends were concealed in woodland, with single trees and clumps set in parkland and with tree belts around the boundary, often with a &#145;ride round the Improvements&#146; winding through them. It was said that &#145;Mr Eame excells in the laying out Water&#146; and he was called in to introduce it into landscapes where it was lacking, as at Hawkstone Park, Shropshire, where in 1786 he made the River Hawk into a lake 1&frac12; miles long. He anticipated the work of Humphry Repton by creating flower gardens adjacent to the house, as at Sandon Hall, Staffordshire, in 1781, where he laid out a garden under the windows of the drawing-room, planted with flowers and flowering shrubs and with a central basin of water with goldfish. Some of his commissions continued for many years; at both Chirk Castle and Erddig, Denbighshire, he supervised the landscaping for twenty-four years.<br>
<br>Although Emes designed a few minor buildings, such as a lodge at Attingham Hall, Shropshire, and a greenhouse at Penrice Castle, Glamorgan, his role as an architect is not significant. At a number of places his landscaping was contemporaneous with work on the house by Samuel or James Wyatt, a professional association that may have started at Kedleston. After his wife died in 1789, Emes moved to Hampshire and took a lease of Elvetham Park from Sir Henry Gough-Calthorpe. A number of commissions in the south of England date from this period, some of which were carried out in partnership with John Webb (1754&#150;1828), who had earlier been his foreman and continued the practice after Emes's death. Emes moved to London and died on 13 March 1803 at Vicarage House, St Giles Cripplegate, the home of his daughter Sarah, wife of the Revd William Holmes. He was buried at the church of St Giles Cripplegate.<br>
