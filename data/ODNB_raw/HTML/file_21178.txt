<span class="headword">Palmer,  Charlotte</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1762, <em>d.</em> in or after 1834), <span class="occ">writer and schoolmistress</span>, lived most of her life in Hendon, Middlesex. Little is known of her life, although much of her writing was instructive, springing from her teaching experience, as she stated she had &#145;taught Writing to young Ladies above nine years&#146;  (Lantz, 239). Her first published work, however, was an epistolary novel in five volumes, <span class="italic">Female Stability, or, The History of Miss Belville</span> (1780). In the preface she claimed it had been written by a sister who had died, and was published unrevised. On the title-page the author is called the late Miss Palmer, perhaps referring to this sister. Certainly there is evidence that Charlotte Palmer was still living after this date. In 1791, for instance, appeared <span class="italic">Letters on several subjects from a preceptress to her pupils who have left school addressed chiefly to real characters</span>. More characteristically didactic, it treats such subjects as dress, choice of books, and clandestine marriage. This book, and <span class="italic">A Newly-Invented Copybook</span> (1797), were intended for use by male tutors, and the latter work was prefaced by a carefully worded and politic apology: &#145;I hope I shall not be considered as having encroached on an Employment belonging to the opposite sex, nor as endeavouring to diminish their superiority&#146;  (Lantz, 240).<br>
<br>Charlotte Palmer's other works are <span class="italic">Integrity and Content: an Allegory</span> (1792) and <span class="italic">It is and it is not: a Novel</span> (1792). Another work attributed to Charlotte Palmer, which appeared in Newberry's 1800 catalogue list, was <span class="italic">Three instructive tales for little folk: simple and careful, industry and sloth, and the cousins</span>.<br>
<br>With another sister, Charlotte Palmer ran schools near London, teaching writing and grammar. In 1805, however, one school was in debt for over &pound;200, and she was imprisoned. Her application for assistance to the Royal Literary Fund was successful, and it made her small payments for some years. When released she ran a day school and also had a private stall in a bonnet shop. Her last communication with the Royal Literary Fund is dated 12 March 1834.<br>
