<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Figg,  James</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1700, <em>d.</em> 1734), <span class="occ">prize-fighter</span>, was born in Thame, Oxfordshire, of unknown parents. Little is known of his early life but by 1714 he was living in London and a scholar of the renowned master of the noble science of defence, Timothy Buck of Clare Market. It appears that during that year Figg himself attained the position of master, which necessitated expertise in such weapons as the backsword and quarterstaff. In due course he opened an amphitheatre adjoining his house, at the sign of the City of Oxford, in Oxford Road. This was later the subject of a dispute between Figg and his landlord, who appeared before the master of the rolls in a hearing which went in favour of the prize-fighter. Figg's amphitheatre became London's premier venue for sporting entertainment and it was considered fashionable for a gentleman to attend frequently the many advertised performances:<blockquote>
<div>From Figg's theatre, he will not miss a night,<br>
</div>
<div>Though cocks and bulls, and Irish women, fight.<br>
</div> (Caulfield, 2.69)</blockquote>Figg is generally regarded as England's first pugilistic champion, although he primarily specialized in &#145;trials of skill&#146; (weapons) rather than &#145;trials of manhood&#146; (fists). However, his amphitheatre was undoubtedly a showcase for some of the best early exponents of regular boxing, including the Lincolnshire drover John Whitacre (Whitaker), John Gretton (Gretting), a Westminster cabinet-maker, and the St Giles pipe-maker, Thomas Allen (Pipes). Figg's own pugilistic exploits seem to have been confined to Southwark fair, where within its duration he exhibited &#145;his knowledge in various Combats&#151;with the Foil, Back-sword, Cudgel, and Fist&#146; at his booth on the bowling green  (Egan, 1.44). He did, however, play an important role in what was almost certainly the first international boxing match. Figg was requested to select a man capable of beating an Italian famous for his fistic ability and personally train him for the contest  (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 16 Jan 1725). The chosen opponent was Whitacre, who defeated the &#145;Venetian Gondolier&#146; on 20 January 1725 at Figg's amphitheatre. Figg also acted on occasions in the capacity of stakeholder, as when Allen and William Smallwood signed articles of agreement to box at his establishment in the summer of 1729.<br>
<br>In line with the prevailing trend of the time, in his numerous trials of skill Figg faced several opponents on a regular basis. He met the noted Dubliner Rowland Bennet (Bennett) on no fewer than twenty-three occasions before April 1731  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 21 April 1731) and often fought another renowned Dublin master, Christopher Perkins. He also participated in three bloody battles with the Irishman William Holmes in less than two months in 1730. The third of these, on 14 October, was Figg's 271st trial, and was terminated in his favour when he cut his opponent's wrist to the bone. However, Figg's greatest rival was Edward Sutton, a Gravesend pipe-maker. One of their encounters, on 14 April 1725, was witnessed by the poet and stenographer John Byrom. He penned a poem describing the event and recorded in his journal: &#145;Figg and Sutton fought; Figg had a wound, and bled pretty much; Sutton had a blow with a quarterstaff just upon his knee, which made him lame, so then they gave over&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Journal</span>, 1.117). Another of Figg's famous battles occurred against John Sparks at the Little (sometimes referred to as the French or New) Theatre in the Haymarket on 3 December 1731. It was contested in front of the duke of Lorraine, Count Kinski, and other persons of distinction, with Figg triumphing to great applause. More unusual was a much earlier trial &#145;at Marybone, between the famous Figg and one Mr. Donald in plain Buff, as they call it&#146; on 11 September 1723, when Figg disabled his opponent by cutting his arm  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 12 Sept 1723).<br>
<br>Several advertisements in contemporary newspapers show that occasionally Figg was scheduled to participate in trials of skill with a fellow master against an opposing duo. His intended partner in one of the earliest of these was Timothy Buck, and in one of the last, Edward Sutton. Although Figg arranged mixed paired encounters at his amphitheatre, he does not appear to have taken part in any of these himself. However, James Stokes, who later set up in opposition to him, was advertised with his wife, Elizabeth, the celebrated &#145;City Championess&#146;, to meet Sutton and a Kentish female at Figg's in August 1725.<br>
<br>Owing to Figg's position as the most respected stage gladiator of his day he was much in demand as a teacher. His success in this field can be measured by the quality of his scholars, among the most renowned of whom were William Flanders of Northamptonshire, Gloucester's William Gill, and Thomas Sibblis from Worcestershire. Figg also had many students among the gentry and nobility. He is said to have boasted that he had not bought a shirt for years, as every time he fought he borrowed one from each of several wealthy pupils. Seeing his master's cut shirt after the battle, each man, supposing this to be what he had lent, did not think it worthwhile to ask for its return, and hence Figg was regularly supplied with fine shirts, always at the expense of others. In June 1731 Figg began teaching at new premises in Poland Street, and his Oxford Road establishment, by then known as Mr Figg's Great Room, was later taken over by Sibblis.<br>
<br>In combat Figg's style was characterized by his coolness, resolution, and peerless judgement. A former pupil, Captain John Godfrey, later wrote &#145;He was just as much a greater MASTER than any other I ever saw, as he was a greater Judge of <i>Time</i> and <i>Measure</i>&#146;  (Godfrey, 41). The marquis de Bretagne, who witnessed an encounter in which Figg sliced off a large piece of an Irish sergeant's calf, considered his dexterity with a sword to be unsurpassed. Figg's expertise stood him in good stead when, on 16 February 1732, two sheriff's officers unlawfully entered his house to arrest an acquaintance of his wife. He fended them off with a hanger (short sword), and proceedings were subsequently instigated against him. On 23 May, at the court of the king's bench, Westminster, the plaintiffs were awarded &pound;100 for the assault. This was nullified when a countercharge by Figg, accusing the officers of trespass, resulted in the same amount of damages being allowed.<br>
<br>Such was Figg's fame that he is traditionally considered to be featured in two notable works by William Hogarth, <span class="italic">Southwark Fair</span> and <span class="italic">A Rake's Progress</span>. In addition, it is probable that he also appears in the artist's <span class="italic">A Midnight Modern Conversation</span>, although a ticket, or business card, depicting Figg, originally regarded as an early engraving by the celebrated painter, is now believed to be of dubious origin. Figg was also known to the thief and renowned gaolbreaker Jack Sheppard, who stopped at the City of Oxford for a pint of sack on his way to be hanged at Tyburn.<br>
<br>In autumn 1729 the earl of Essex appointed Figg gatekeeper of the upper St James's Park. He died on 8 December 1734 at his house in the Oxford Road and was interred in the burial-ground of the parish church of St Marylebone three days later. Although there is little doubt that Figg was married, nothing is known of his wife except that she was reported by the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> to have given birth to a son the day after Figg's burial.<br>
