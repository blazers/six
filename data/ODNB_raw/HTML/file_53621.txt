<span class="headword">Dalling, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1731&#150;1798), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born at Earsham Street, Bungay, Suffolk, the son of John Dalling (<i>d</i>. 1744), who owned the staithe and navigation of Bungay and the nearby manor of Bardolph, and Anne, daughter of Colonel William Windham of Earsham Hall, near Bungay. His mother's elder brother, William Windham, who inherited Earsham Hall, was comptroller of the household to William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, when Cumberland was commander-in-chief in Flanders, and it is likely that Windham used his influence to secure for Dalling an ensign's commission in the army (dated 24 February 1747). He was promoted captain in the 4th King's Own regiment of foot on 21 January 1753, and then major in the 28th foot on 2 February 1757. In March 1757 he sailed with the 28th foot for North America to join the campaign against the French. Again, his path had been eased by his uncle's connections, in this case his friendship with Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander of the British forces in North America. Dalling's regiment was part of the failed expedition against Louisbourg, led by John Campbell, fourth earl of Loudoun, and in October 1757 joined the garrison at Fort Cumberland.<br>
<br>Early in 1758 Dalling took part in the successful expedition against Louisbourg under Amherst. After the capitulation of the town, on 27 July 1758, he was sent by Amherst with 300 troops to reduce French fishing settlements along the coast of Prince Edward Island, returning to camp on 20 August with a large quantity of materials to build winter quarters. Still a major, though now second in command of his regiment, Dalling took part in James Wolfe's expedition to capture Quebec in 1759 and was given command of a body of light infantry. During the stalemate of July fighting patrols were sent out to scour and ravage the countryside. Dalling's raiding party of 25 July was one of the more successful, returning with 250 prisoners and some 500 horses, sheep, and cows.<br>
<br>Following the capture of Quebec in September, Dalling joined the garrison, where his light infantry were employed in the petty warfare of the winter months, skirmishing with forces sent by the French commander, de Levis, to capture British outposts. In February, during a sharp exchange in the snow near the settlement of Church at Point Levi, Dalling was injured in the foot, a troublesome wound which required several operations. However, on 27 February 1760, before returning to England to convalesce with his uncle at the house of the duke of Cumberland, he was made lieutenant colonel of the 43rd foot, and on 28 April 1760, at the battle of St Foy, he commanded the light infantry stationed on Lieutenant-Colonel James Murray's right flank. The arrival of British naval forces in May forced the French to retreat.<br>
<br>Dalling took command of the 43rd foot in 1761, while it was encamped on Staten Island in readiness for the descent on the French West Indies. He led his regiment in the capture of Martinique, Grenada, St Lucia, and St Vincent and its dependencies in late 1761 and early 1762. From garrison duty on Martinique, in May 1762, his regiment was ordered to join the expedition against Havana, Cuba; the siege lasted until mid-August. Afterwards Dalling was ordered with his regiment to Jamaica, where, apart from visits to England, he remained for the next twenty years. About 1767 he married Grace (1746/1747&#150;1768), the eldest daughter of Philip Pinnock (1720&#150;1778), speaker in the Jamaican assembly in 1768&#150;9 and from 1775 to 1778. The Pinnocks, a wealthy and influential family, assisted Dalling's social and professional rise in the colony. On 4 December 1767 Dalling transferred his lieutenant-colonelcy to the 36th regiment, which had replaced the 43rd foot on garrison duty, and about 1768 he was made governor of Fort Charles and lieutenant-governor of the island. However, his wife died on 6 July 1768, aged twenty-one, leaving an infant daughter, Elizabeth Windham Dalling&#151;who in turn died at sea on 1 November 1768. In or possibly before 1770 Dalling married, secondly, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1824), the daughter of Excelles Lawford, of Burwood, Surrey.<br>
<br>Dalling was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel on 25 May 1772 and on 14 August 1772 transferred his lieutenant-colonel's commission to the 50th foot, that regiment having succeeded the 36th foot on garrison duty. Upon the death of Sir William Trelawny in December 1772, Dalling acted as governor until the arrival of Sir Basil Keith in January 1774. During this brief interlude Dalling took an interest in the small British settlement on the Mosquito Coast. He imposed a new constitution on the settlers which strengthened the position of the superintendent, Thomas Hodgson. When in November 1773 Dalling, at the superintendent's request, dissolved the local council, alarm was raised in London, where the government, mindful of the weakness of British claims to the Mosquito Coast, recalled Hodgson. When Keith arrived in Jamaica, he annulled Dalling's policy and entered into new negotiations with the settlers. Dalling later renewed his interest in Central America with disastrous consequences.<br>
<br>Upon the arrival of the 3rd battalion of the 60th (Royal American) regiment Dalling was made its colonel commandant (16 January 1776). Following the death of Keith in 1777, on 29 August 1777 Dalling was promoted to the rank of major-general and on 1 September 1777 was confirmed as governor of Jamaica. He was expected by the British government to prepare the island's defences for the possibility of French attack, should France intervene in the War of American Independence.<br>
<br>Dalling often seemed a reluctant governor. He reported somewhat prophetically to Lord George Germain, secretary of state for the colonies, in 1779 that:<blockquote>through his wound, gout and the effect of the climate on his nerves, he will soon find himself not equal to the charge &hellip; and would therefore wish to be considered an old woman at home than to prove himself so in office abroad. (<span class="italic">Stopford-Sackville MSS</span>, 95a)</blockquote>The threat of French invasion in 1778 was averted temporarily by the arrival of reinforcements. When Spain entered the war in June 1779, Dalling was instructed to consider offensive action against the coast of Central America. However, the Spanish moved more quickly, destroying the British settlement of St Georges Key in the Bay of Honduras in mid-September. A small force sent by Dalling under the command of Major William Dalrymple was unable to recapture the key, but took instead the Spanish port of Omoa in the Bay of Honduras and with it 3 million dollars of Guatemalan gold.<br>
<br>Although lacking experience of independent command, Dalling was now emboldened to carry out a grandiose scheme to capture Fort St Juan, which guarded the entrance to Lake Nicaragua, and then to establish a series of forts across the isthmus of Central America. He sent a force of 400 soldiers, which sailed on 3 February 1780 on the <i>Hinchingbrook</i>, under the naval command of Captain Horatio Nelson. However, owing to constant delays and a lack of knowledge of the terrain, the fort was not captured until 29 April and the onset of the rainy season. Sickness and disease began to deplete the force, which was forced to return to the coast, leaving behind a small garrison.<br>
<br>Dalling refused to believe that the expedition was effectively ruined and continued to send reinforcements to the coast during the summer. In total, some 1400 men were sent, of whom just 320 survived. In November Dalling finally gave the order to blow up the fort and evacuate the remaining troops. His position was now precarious in the extreme. Military failure and the renewed threat of invasion were compounded by a series of natural disasters in the colony. On 2 October 1780 a tidal wave destroyed the town of Savanna La Mar, and this was followed by a hurricane and an earthquake. In 1781 there was another hurricane and a catastrophic fire in Kingston. A financial crisis caused by a lack of specie in the colony only worsened the economic distress of wartime. Moreover the death of his father-in-law, Philip Pinnock, in 1778 had removed an important source of support in the assembly, with whom relations had rapidly deteriorated following Dalling's imposition of martial law in 1779.<br>
<br>With an all too evident want of judgement, Dalling became embroiled in a quarrel with Admiral Sir Peter Parker over the division of the spoils from the raid on Omoa. This escalated to the point where he ignored a direct order from the government and was removed from office. When Dalling dismissed the attorney-general, Thomas Harrison, for refusing his request to prosecute Parker for trespassing on the crown's possessions, Harrison took the matter to the lords of the Admiralty. Their report of 5 April 1780 ordering Harrison's reinstatement (as advocate-general) was ignored by Dalling, who then suspended members of the local judiciary after they also supported Harrison. A Board of Trade inquiry later criticized Dalling's abuse of power and ordered the reinstatement of the judges.<br>
<br>Growing doubts over Dalling's conduct as governor were heightened by the fall of Mobile in March 1780 and Pensacola in May 1781, though delays in sending reinforcements were due partly to a lack of transports. Thus in March 1781 Germain was ready to yield to Dalling's earlier request to return home. Perversely, however, Dalling had changed his mind, having conceived a desperate plan to conquer the Dutch possession of Cura&ccedil;ao. Germain sent two further orders in June and December recalling him to Britain. Dalling left before receiving the second, handing over his commission as governor to Lieutenant-Governor Archibald Campbell and boarding ship on 24 November 1781. Notwithstanding evident failings, Dalling was promoted (under the rule of strict seniority) to the rank of lieutenant-general on 20 November 1782. He was made a baronet on 11 March 1783. On 1 November 1783 he transferred to the colonelcy of the 37th regiment, a commission he held until his death. He was never given an active military command after his Central American adventure, though between 1784 and 1786 he was commander-in-chief at Madras and a member of the council. Upon his recall he was granted an annuity of &pound;1000 for life. On 3 May 1796 he was promoted to the rank of general.<br>
<br>Dalling died on 16 January 1798 at Clifton, near Bristol. His fifth but eldest surviving son and heir from his second marriage, William Windham Dalling (1774&#150;1864), who inherited the Windham estate at Earsham, succeeded him as second and last baronet. His other children included John Windham Dalling, his youngest son, who served as a midshipman on the <i>Defence</i> at Trafalgar in 1805, and Anne Louise (<i>d</i>. 1853), who married General Robert Meade; their son John eventually inherited Earsham.<br>
