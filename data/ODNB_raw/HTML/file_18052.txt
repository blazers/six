<span class="headword">Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [Margaret Tudor]</span>  (1489&#150;1541), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of James IV</span>, was born at Westminster Palace on 28 November 1489, the eldest daughter and second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12954/', "Henry VII (1457&#150;1509)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8635/', "Elizabeth of York (1466&#150;1503)")</script>, and baptized in St Margaret's, Westminster, later that year. Attended by Alice Bywmble as her special nurse and Anne Maylande and Margaret Troughton as rockers of her cradle, she spent her earliest years at Sheen on the banks of the Thames with her brothers and sisters, until a fire caused the royal nursery to be moved to Eltham Palace. Less studious than her brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/705/', "Arthur")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12955/', "Henry (the future Henry VIII)")</script>, Margaret learned to play the lute and clavichord and to dance, became skilled at archery, studied Latin, and learned to speak French. Her tutors included such notable scholars as Thomas Linacre, John Colet, and William Grocyn.<h2>
<a name="Scottishmarriage"></a>Scottish marriage</h2>It was inevitable that thought would soon be given to Margaret's marriage. At first her father considered betrothing her to Prince Christian of Denmark, but his thoughts soon turned to nearer home, and on 5 May 1496 he opened negotiations for marrying his daughter to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14590/', "James IV, king of Scots (1473&#150;1513)")</script>. Later that year diplomatic progress was halted by the outbreak of Anglo-Scottish hostilities resulting from James's support for Perkin Warbeck, but resumed after he had deserted the pretender. The need to obtain a papal dispensation also caused delay. But by late 1501 Scottish negotiators were pressing for the marriage. King Henry calmed critics who feared that such a union would lead to a Scottish king succeeding to the English throne by pointing out that the greater unit (England) would none the less draw the lesser one (Scotland) into its orbit. The marriage treaty was concluded on 24 January 1502. Henry pledged a &pound;10,000 dowry, while James promised his bride &pound;1000 Scots per annum together with lands and castles yielding a further yearly income of &pound;6000. Margaret would be accompanied by twenty-four English servants, and would also have an appropriate number of Scottish domestics. Should she be widowed, she was promised &pound;2000 per annum and the continued income of her lands.<br>
<br>The earl of Bothwell represented James IV at his king's proxy marriage to Margaret on 15 January 1503, against a background of church bells, bonfires, jousts and tournaments, dancing, and feasting. Although her mother died just before she travelled north to Scotland, on 8 July 1503, now aged thirteen, Margaret left Richmond Palace for her 33-day journey to Edinburgh, accompanied by a large retinue headed by Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey. Henry went with them on the first stage of the journey north. About 1000 Scots met the English company at Berwick and accompanied their new queen into Scotland early in August, after several days of festivities in which James IV played a prominent part. The formal wedding took place in an elaborate service in the chapel of Holyroodhouse on 8 August. Although James provided Margaret with jewels and rich gowns, he continued to visit Janet Kennedy, his mistress since 1498; moreover, Margaret's dower castle of Stirling contained the nursery for her husband's seven illegitimate children. How the queen responded to this evidence for James's physical exuberance is not recorded.<br>
<br>Early in 1507 Margaret gave birth to a son, James, but the baby prince died at Stirling on 27 February 1508. A daughter, born at Holyrood on 15 July 1508, died the same day. Her brother Arthur had left a significant fortune to Margaret, now in the keeping of Henry VIII, and in spring 1513 Margaret asked the English ambassador, Nicholas West, both for Arthur's bequest and also for the plate and jewels left her by her grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. West replied that these would only be handed over if James IV remained at peace with England, instead of joining France. Margaret begged her husband not to go to war against her brother, but in vain, and on 9 September 1513 James was killed at Flodden, along with some 10,000 Scots. Their infant son, born at Linlithgow on 11 April 1512, succeeded his father as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Remarriageandexile"></a>Remarriage and exile</h2>James IV's will provided that Margaret should serve as regent as long as she did not remarry. A council of four nobles was established to help her govern. Henry VIII was now determined to influence Scottish affairs through his sister, a development resented by patriotic Scots, and on 6 August 1514 Margaret played into their hands by taking a second husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7866/', "Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus (c.1489&#150;1557)")</script>, the greatest Scottish magnate, so forfeiting her right to the regency. Partly because she was distrusted by many Scottish nobles, who also regarded the Douglas family as over-powerful, the council invited a cousin of James IV, John Stewart or Stuart, second duke of Albany, to act as regent until the infant James V came of age. Albany, the son of James III's younger brother Alexander, had grown up in France and was highly regarded as a soldier. The Scots, believing that a man of his eminence was needed to keep order and defend the country against England, persuaded the French to allow the duke to cross to Scotland; he landed at Dumbarton on 18 May 1515 with eight ships bearing supplies and French soldiers.<br>
<br>Many Scots regarded Margaret primarily as the sister of the hated English king, and suspected she favoured England over Scotland. For her part, Margaret bitterly resented Albany's replacing her as regent and urged Henry to restore her authority by force. She also complained frequently to her brother about her inadequate revenues and welcomed his intervention with the pope to secure the see of Dunkeld for Gavin Douglas, her husband's uncle. But although Henry was angry with Fran&ccedil;ois I for allowing Albany's passage to Scotland, thereby reducing English influence there, he did little to help his sister. Margaret's circumstances were indeed unhappy, and became more so when her brother's efforts to gain possession of her two sons, James V and Alexander, duke of Ross (born on 30 April 1514), led to the children's being taken from her as a safeguard against English designs. Having lost the regency, her revenues, and control of her own children, the queen fled to England on 30 September 1515, even though she was heavily pregnant. Henry arranged for her to be welcomed at Harbottle Castle in Northumberland with gifts of fine clothes and money, and by the end of the year she had twenty-two gowns of cloth of gold.<br>
<br>At Henry's behest, Angus and Alexander, third Lord Home, attempted to seize Margaret's sons at Stirling and bring them to England, but the coup failed and they lost sixteen men. Shortly after her arrival at Harbottle, on 7 October 1515, Margaret gave birth to a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7911/', "Margaret Douglas")</script>, an ordeal which nearly killed her and left her so weak that in late November she had to be conveyed to Morpeth in a litter. Angus, Home, and a few others visited her there, and also promised to promote Henry's interests in Scotland. Margaret was herself determined to visit her brother in London, but Angus returned to Scotland to defend his interests there against Albany. On 18 December, while she lay seriously ill at Morpeth, Margaret's second son, Alexander, died. His mother was not informed immediately for fear the shock might prove fatal. On 3 May 1516 she and her entourage finally arrived in London, to be welcomed with jousts, feasting, and celebrations lasting for a month; there Margaret had her first meeting with Henry for thirteen years. She remained in England for over a year, separated from Angus, while Albany and the Scottish council, hoping to prevent English raids, promised to send the queen's jewels after her and to pay her her rents. But although Margaret received her jewels, her revenues were not restored, and she had to borrow money from Cardinal Wolsey.<h2>
<a name="BreachwithAngus"></a>Breach with Angus</h2>After Henry had launched further raids into Scotland to put pressure on the Scots, and after much diplomacy and many threats, in 1517 Fran&ccedil;ois I called Albany back to France. Before he left the duke gave assurances that Margaret could return to Scotland and take possession of her revenues and property. Moreover, she and her company would be &#145;free from arrest, injury, or impediment&#146;, provided they did nothing &#145;prejudicial to the king, governor, or realm&#146;  (Hannay and Hay, 41). The Scottish estates insisted that Albany had treated Margaret &#145;with fairness and indulgence&#146;, despite her plot to place her children in English hands  (ibid., 42). Furnished with a safe conduct, the queen began her journey back to Scotland on 18 May 1517, equipped with fine clothes, jewels, money, and horses. Angus met her at Berwick, and on 15 June accompanied her into Scotland, where her return was greeted with relief by a government hoping now to allay tensions with England.<br>
<br>Unfortunately Margaret's marriage to Angus was coming increasingly under strain. While she had been in England her husband had been living with a mistress (and former fianc&eacute;e), Lady Jane Stewart of Traquair, cohabiting with her on Margaret's money. He had also taken the queen's rents from Methven and Ettrick Forest. Discovering his infidelity (which had also led to the birth of a daughter, Janet), Margaret begged her brother to allow her to return to England. Henry, however, sent neither money nor troops, and instead urged her to return to Angus. Deprived of her revenues, and refused permission to live with her son for fear she would remove him to England, she wrote that she would rather be dead than live among the Scottish lords. Thomas, Lord Dacre, the English march warden, echoed her complaint when he asked that aid be sent to Margaret, who &#145;lies in Edinburgh like a poor suitor&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1509&#150;89</i>, 7).<br>
<br>Following his return to France, Albany played a central role in negotiating the Franco-Scottish treaty of Rouen, concluded on 26 August 1517, which provided for mutual assistance should Henry VIII make war on either signatory. On 2 October 1518, however, Fran&ccedil;ois I made an alliance with Henry, whose terms included an undertaking that Albany would be kept in France as long as this second treaty remained in force. The Scots felt slighted by this, and they desperately wanted Albany to return, regarding his links with France as a safeguard against English aggression. Against this background of international diplomacy, Queen Margaret, lacking funds, power, and authority over her son, had become a figure of little account, and in 1519 she again asked to be allowed to return to England. To add to her misery, her estrangement from Angus was now so severe that she contemplated divorce. Seeing no chance of an improvement in the prevailing situation, Margaret reversed her position and began petitioning Albany to return, thinking that the French duke might treat her better than did the Scottish estates. Her brother was furious, however, and at his urging she reluctantly returned to Angus, through whom Henry hoped to exercise leverage in Scotland. But although the estates promised to safeguard her revenues, her position did not improve, and in October 1520 she was again lamenting her desperate need of money and the fact that she was only rarely allowed to see her son. She threatened to give support to anti-English factions if Henry did not relieve her plight.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithAlbany"></a>Relations with Albany</h2>Margaret was miserable over her status, the Scots were unhappy that Albany was detained in France, and Henry was angry that Margaret had again separated from Angus and now supported Albany's return. Margaret even persuaded Albany to promote her bid for a divorce, believing he had influence at Rome. Then in 1521 Henry VIII's alliance with Emperor Charles V led to Fran&ccedil;ois I's sending Albany back to Scotland. He entered Edinburgh on 3 December and was welcomed by the queen, who continued to hope that he would restore her revenues and help her obtain a divorce. Henry, however, refused to make peace, or even a border truce, while Albany remained in Scotland. The duke did in fact arrange better treatment for Margaret, but this merely fuelled the malicious tales spread by Angus and his followers that Albany supported the queen's divorce so that he could marry her himself, kill James V, and become king. In England there were additional rumours that Margaret had become Albany's mistress, rumours which Henry did not hesitate to convey to his sister in a letter brought to Margaret by Clarenceux herald in February 1522. They reduced her to tears, and prompted an indignant response to Henry's &#145;sharp and unkind letter&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 3/2, no. 2038). Supported by the estates, the duke banished Angus and his brother George to France, and in September gathered an army with the intention of invading England. But fear of a repetition of Flodden held the Scots back from attacking Carlisle, and Margaret was able to persuade Albany and Dacre to conclude a truce. Disgusted by the reluctance of the Scots to fight, Albany appointed a regency council, from which the queen was excluded, and on 27 October sailed for France.<br>
<br>Albany's departure did not end Anglo-Scottish hostilities. Following devastating English raids in spring 1523, Margaret (who had been ill with smallpox in the previous December, but soon recovered) decided in July to co-operate with Henry, in the hope that the English king would help elevate James V to active rule. Implicit in this volte-face was a willingness to see Albany ousted as regent. The Scottish nobility still trusted the duke, however, and again asked Fran&ccedil;ois I to allow him to return to Scotland. Fran&ccedil;ois complied, and on 23 September Albany landed at Kirkcudbright with several thousand French troops, planning once more to invade England. Fearing retribution for having urged that his regency be terminated, Margaret yet again petitioned for leave to retire to England, but Henry sent her money and ordered her to stay in Scotland.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1523 a large Scottish army again refused to cross the border, and Albany, his prestige greatly reduced by this failure, decided to return to France. He established a rotating governorship for the young king, whereby groups of four nobles took turns to have custody of James for three months at a time, and with Margaret's support tried to negotiate an Anglo-Scottish truce to which the French would also be party. But when he departed on 20 May 1524 he had failed to secure the terms he sought, while Henry decided to bring Angus back from France. Albany left Scotland intending to return, though in fact he never did so, and before his departure he obtained promises from Margaret that she would do nothing to undermine his authority, would reject any Anglo-Scottish peace which excluded France, and would uphold the treaty of Rouen. He also secured an undertaking from the estates to treat the queen well. But no sooner had Albany gone than Margaret, who had threatened to leave with him should her hated husband return and again withhold her revenues, won the support of the powerful Hamilton family, led by the second earl of Arran, for a coup which formally ended Albany's regency and on 26 July invested James V with full royal authority.<h2>
<a name="ThelastyearsofJamessminority"></a>The last years of James's minority</h2>James promptly indicated that he would follow Henry's advice, raising the latter's hopes of a rupture in the Franco-Scottish alliance. Meanwhile the English king welcomed Angus in London, causing Margaret, who above all else feared her husband's return, to denounce Henry's plans to exercise influence in Scotland through him. In the hope of keeping Angus away, she and Arran, who with her effectively headed the government, worked for an Anglo-Scottish alliance pleasing to King Henry, who sent large sums to strengthen the position of his sister and her son. There was now a significant additional personal dimension to Margaret's aversion to her husband's return. As the third duke of Norfolk reported to Wolsey on 19 September 1524, &#145;The Queen is very unpopular for taking so much upon herself, and being ruled only by Arran and Henry Steward; also for her ungodly living, in keeping Angus out of the realm when he is so beloved&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/1, no. 672). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26472/', "Henry Stewart (c.1495&#150;1553/4)")</script> was Margaret's treasurer and eventually became her third husband. In November she was reported to be infatuated with him.<br>
<br>Although the Scottish parliament declared Albany's regency to be over on 26 November 1524, it also resolved to maintain the French alliance; attempts to negotiate peace with England, and even the marriage of King James to Princess Mary, came to grief on this point. Henry provided Angus with &#145;power, substance and counsaill&#146; in his efforts to prise Scotland and France apart  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 4.207), and also tried to bully his sister into compliance, threatening to stop paying for her 200-strong bodyguard and affecting outrage over her rejection of Angus and liaison with Stewart. Fearing that her regime would be overthrown by its enemies, Margaret asked Henry to pay for 300 guards instead of 200, and when he refused put on a display of Francophilia, further irritating her brother by suggesting that the English ambassadors should go home.<br>
<br>There was a widespread perception that Margaret lacked good counsel, and that her government was too narrowly based. When parliament met in November 1524 it attempted to remedy this by establishing a council of four to help her rule. But her failure to secure anything more than a two-month truce with England undermined the queen's position, and with the support of Henry VIII, who was tired of his sister's unreliability, her rejection of her husband, and her pleas for money, in February 1525 Angus was able to take a leading position in government. Henry also agreed that Angus should take control of his wife's lands. Presumably it was to strengthen the queen's hand at this difficult moment, and also to prevent James V's marriage to Mary Tudor, that Fran&ccedil;ois I offered Margaret the French <i>comt&eacute;</i> of Longy and a pension of 20,000 &eacute;cus, on condition that her son should in due course marry his own daughter Madeleine. Such personal satisfaction as the French king's intervention may have brought her was followed later in 1525 by political disaster. It became Angus's turn to have custody of James V, but he refused to surrender the king at the end of his three-month turn, instead keeping control of him and of Scottish government until 1528. No longer supported by Henry VIII, and with control of her son lost to the hated Angus, Margaret was reduced to near despair. Moreover, despite the provision made for her in the Anglo-Scottish peace which was ratified on 12 February 1526, Angus still refused to return her lands.<br>
<br>An attempt by the third earl of Lennox to free King James from Angus's custody had been defeated at Linlithgow on 4 September 1526. Lennox was killed, and Angus and the Douglases were left without a rival. Margaret had continued to urge Albany to use his influence at Rome to help her obtain a divorce from Angus, since she was determined never to be reconciled with him but to marry Henry Stewart instead. She had originally attempted to justify the separation on the specious grounds that James IV had not been killed at Flodden, but was still alive when she married Angus; however, when Clement VII finally annulled the marriage, on 11 March 1527, it was by reference to Angus's pre-contract to Lady Jane Stewart. Soon afterwards Margaret secretly married Henry Stewart, openly acknowledging him as her husband about the beginning of April 1528. Angus then had Henry Stewart arrested and confined, claiming that Margaret's remarriage had taken place without royal approval. For the queen, this development meant that she could keep company with her present husband only if her former one was removed from power. In May 1528, however, James V escaped from Angus's clutches, proclaimed himself king in his majority, and mustered enough support to expel the Douglases from government. On 19 June his mother caused James, who had come to loathe his erstwhile stepfather, to order that neither Angus nor any other Douglas should come within 7 miles of him. Henry Stewart was created Lord Methven, and in September parliament sentenced Angus and his associates to death <i>in absentia</i>, for treason. No doubt Margaret was delighted. She was less pleased, however, when Angus took refuge in England. She angrily accused her brother of having more regard for the earl than for his own nephew. Angus remained in exile at Henry's expense until 1543.<h2>
<a name="Disengagementanddeath"></a>Disengagement and death</h2>After 1528 relations between the young king and his mother were generally good, but they differed over foreign policy, Margaret favouring closer links with England, in contrast to James, who renewed the French alliance soon after assuming personal rule. He sought her advice on the rebuilding or renovation of royal castles, but in matters of government took counsel elsewhere, and it is noticeable that Margaret's name is entirely missing from her son's letters dating from after 1534. When Henry proposed a meeting with James at York late in 1534, Margaret's enthusiasm for the event&#151;partly arising from hopes of arranging the marriage of James to Mary Tudor&#151;seems to have turned the Scottish king against the conference, which never happened. Two years later plans were again made for the two kings to meet. Margaret prepared to visit England and bought expensive clothes in anticipation of the journey, which likewise never took place. Afterwards she asked Henry for money to repay debts incurred at this time, but her brother refused, advising her to stay in Scotland and either return her purchases or put them to other uses. Shortly afterwards her hopes of an Anglo-Scottish marriage alliance were dashed when James married Madeleine of France in Paris on 1 January 1537, but she still had the gall to beg Henry for funds yet again, so that she could appear suitably dressed at the reception of her new daughter-in-law; this time Henry complied.<br>
<br>By the mid-1530s Margaret's personal life had turned sour once more, and she sent a stream of letters to Henry VIII and his ministers complaining of her husband, Lord Methven: not only had he taken a mistress, with whom he had a son, but he had so wasted her revenues that she was 8000 merks in debt. She had resolved to divorce him, but her efforts were thwarted by her son, after Methven told James that she proposed to go to England and there remarry Angus. Early in October 1537 she tried to escape to Berwick but was intercepted. Later that month, in an outburst of self-pity, she told her brother, &#145;wyth owt I get remedy, I wol pas to some relygeous place, and byde wyth them, or I be intretyd as I am&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 5.120). Queen Madeleine died on 7 July 1537, and in 1538 James married another Frenchwoman, Mary of Guise. Once more Margaret begged Henry to send her money so that she could appear in attire befitting her rank when her son and his new bride reached Scotland. After their arrival Margaret informed Henry that Mary had &#145;behaved very honorably toward her&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1509&#150;89</i>, 39). But she now had little influence with either her son or her brother, though she was at the Scottish court in 1541, and gave comfort to James and Mary when their infant sons died in May. The husband she now hated controlled her revenues, and she was lonely and unhappy. She wanted to return to England, but Henry would not invite her, and in her last years practically ignored her.<br>
<br>On 18 October 1541, in her fifty-second year, Queen Margaret died after suffering a stroke at Methven Castle. She asked for her son, who was at Falkland Palace, but he did not arrive in time. In her last words she asked her confessors to beseech James &#145;that He wold be good and gracous unto the Erell of Anguyshe, and dyd extremely lament, and aske God mercy, that She had afendet unto the sayd Erell as She hade&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 5.194). She left just 2500 merks in ready money. Dying intestate, she asked that her valuables should go to Margaret Douglas, but James ignored this request and his mother's goods reverted to the crown. She was buried among the Scottish kings in St John's Abbey, the Carthusian house in Perth.<br>
<br>It is difficult to gain a clear impression of Queen Margaret, in terms either of her personality or of her impact on events. Scottish sources often reflect native suspicions of an English queen, English ones the hopes&#151;usually unfulfilled&#151;of diplomatic advantage. It seems clear that her years in Scotland were generally unhappy. She was only twenty-three when her first husband was killed, her two subsequent marriages both failed utterly, and she had limited contact with both her son in Scotland and her daughter in England. The nature of the sources means that it is usually hard to detach the evidence for her parental feelings from her hopes of material advantage, but she clearly wanted the company of her son during the latter's childhood, and in 1536 she pleaded for Lady Margaret Douglas when she disgraced herself by marrying Lord Thomas Howard. Her choice of husbands was disastrous, however, and her involvement in government usually unsuccessful. Nor was she a skilful manager of her income, and her importunities for money finally exhausted the patience of her brother Henry VIII, who had been remarkably tolerant of her demands. Whether these shortcomings arose from difficult circumstances or from her own lack of judgement, compounded by a greater concern with the trappings than the exercise of power, is again unclear, but her recurrent preoccupation with appearances certainly suggests the latter. But in one respect she was undeniably a successful queen, for it was from her first marriage that there sprang the line that eventually united England and Scotland.<br>
