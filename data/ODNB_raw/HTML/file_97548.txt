<span class="headword">Black,  Dorothy <span class="st"> [Kitty]</span></span>  (1914&#150;2006), <span class="occ">theatrical agent and translator</span>, was born on 30 April 1914 in Johannesburg, South Africa, the younger daughter and youngest of six children of Francis Black (<i>d</i>. 1918), quantity surveyor, and his wife, Elizabeth Johanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Albertyn. A brother, Brian Black, a rugby international, was killed in a flying accident in 1940.<br>
<br>Black was educated first at Roedean School, Johannesburg, then in England, at St Albans, and finally, having passed her university entrance examination, at a finishing school in Paris. There she was persuaded by her music teacher to train as a concert pianist. She gave her first public recital in the Maison Pleyel when she was seventeen, then spent four years travelling in Europe, North and South America, and the West Indies with her mother. &#145;Sober reflection&#146; during her travels  (Black, 15) persuaded her that a career as a concert pianist was unlikely and so she learned to use a stenography machine and registered with a secretarial agency in London.<br>
<br>Black's first job was as a junior shorthand typist at H. M. Tennent Ltd, a theatrical management company. She arrived in 1937, impressing both Hugh (Binkie) Beaumont, one of the firm's directors, and Harry Tennent, the managing director, with the ease and speed with which her stenography machine could manage dictation. By the end of her first month she was able to reflect: &#145;Not only was the theatre my abiding passion, but I was actually going to be allowed to earn my living working in it. The square peg had found the square hole and I was supremely happy&#146;  (Black, 7). Tennents was already a major player when Black arrived, and as the firm's status rose, so she assumed a greater part in the organization, liaising with clients and acting as the company's unofficial casting director for minor roles, as well as off-stage pianist and audition accompanist. In 1939 she became Beaumont's secretary, then, having assisted John Gielgud with the transcription of <span class="italic">Early Stages</span>, became his secretary as well in 1940. Following Beaumont's creation of a non-profit making arm of the company Black became increasingly involved in organizing and overseeing tours of airforce bases and regional theatres. A confident and sometimes overbearing woman, she was supremely loyal to Tennents, and was much annoyed when they appointed a casting director: &#145;half my job and much of the fun disappeared&#146;  (Black, 96). After the war Beaumont invited John Perry, formerly Gielgud's lover and now his, to join the firm&#151;in what Black described as a &#145;fairly unspecified capacity&#146;&#151;which only increased her sense of grievance  (ibid., 110). As a result she moved, at Beaumont's suggestion, to become assistant to Murray Macdonald, administrator of the Company of Four (Tennents' non-profit making subsidiary), at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith.<br>
<br>The Company of Four's brief was to produce new plays with new directors and designers and to provide jobs for actors returning from the forces. Black and Macdonald worked happily together for many years, and presided over some major theatrical and box office triumphs, including <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>, <span class="italic">The Holly and the Ivy</span>, <span class="italic">Let's Make an Opera!</span>, and John Gielgud's season of classical revivals (<span class="italic">Richard II</span>, <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, and <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>). Despite their success Perry made it clear that she would never be the administrator of the company. Black therefore left in 1953 to become head of drama at the leading literary agency Curtis Brown. Already enormously well connected, she transformed the fortunes of the department through her tireless networking (much of it on the golf course) and powers of persuasion. Among her clients were Angus Wilson, Somerset Maugham, and Samuel Beckett.<br>
<br>Black's years in Paris had resulted in a profound Francophilia that earned her the nickname Noir. The war had kick-started her career as a translator and adaptor: years of reading plays and watching productions take shape had instilled in her a respect for dramaturgical principles, which, married with her facility for languages, earned her a considerable reputation. In 1940 she provided Noel Coward with a literal translation of a Parisian hit, <span class="italic">Histoire de rire</span> by Armand Salacrou. Although Coward declared himself delighted with the result, her efforts came to nothing when the fall of France ended any chances of negotiating rights for an English production. Immediately after the war her fluent French and can-do attitude got her the job of technical adviser and interpreter to the Old Vic's victory in Europe tour, organized by the British Council. She subsequently found success with her translations of Sartre's <span class="italic">Crime passionel</span> and Kean and Anouilh's <span class="italic">Point of Departure</span>. She also provided the literal translation for Anouilh's <span class="italic">L'invitation au ch&acirc;teau</span>, adapted by Christopher Fry into <span class="italic">Ring Around the Moon</span>, directed by Peter Brook, and she produced and edited translations for Peter Daubney's World Theatre seasons.<br>
<br>In 1957 Black left Curtis Brown and England when she became engaged. This period of her life is tantalizingly blank, but she returned to England unmarried within a year and went on to work in television. She was also, thanks to her friendship with Allan Crawford, an unlikely supporter and financial backer of the first &#145;pirate&#146; radio station, Radio Atlanta. For many years she lived in a large terrace house in Brunswick Gardens, Kensington, where she entertained prodigiously until her last years, which were clouded by the onset of Parkinson's disease. She died on 26 December 2006 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, of ischaemic heart disease. She never married, and had no children.<br>
