<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  William</span>, lord of Nithsdale  (<em>c.</em>1360&#150;1391), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7861/', "Archibald Douglas, third earl of Douglas")</script> (called Archibald the Grim; <i>c</i>.1320&#150;1400), and an unknown mother. He was presumably prominent as a warrior by September 1384, when, already a knight, he was awarded a royal annuity of a type used to maintain participants in border conflict with England. Scottish chronicle accounts relate some of his early military exploits. They are not possible to date accurately, but probably refer to the Anglo-Scottish warfare of 1384 and 1385, and suggest that Douglas was particularly active in the fighting on the western marches. The details of his triumphs as recorded in the chronicles cannot, however, be relied upon: he is depicted as a conventional chivalric hero with all the requisite attendant qualities. Among these is a comely and statuesque physical appearance, a detail which gives no accurate guidance as to how Sir William looked. The accumulation of enthusiastic chronicle tales regarding his military activities do, none the less, point to his being an effective border warrior. At a time when attacking England was an important plank of royal policy, such prowess had its rewards. His chivalric reputation helped him to secure marriage to Egidia, a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II")</script> and allegedly an internationally renowned beauty, by 26 December 1387. On that date Douglas and his new wife were granted the substantial annuity of &pound;300 from the royal customs. By then, too, he had been granted the royal lordship of Nithsdale, which probably brought him little in the way of land, but conferred substantial jurisdictional authority&#151;rights as warden, sheriff, justiciar, and chamberlain&#151;within the area between Galloway and Annandale. This area was also, of course, a handy base from which to launch attacks on Cumbria or oppose English incursions into south-west Scotland.<br>
<br>When Anglo-Scottish war recommenced in 1388, Douglas was again heavily embroiled in the fighting. In June of that year he led a seaborne expedition to Ulster which defeated the local defensive forces, sacked the town of Carlingford, and then raided the Isle of Man before returning to Galloway. The exercise was hugely successful for Douglas and his colleagues. On one level the plundering provided the opportunity for personal profit: the chronicler Walter Bower claims the raiders were greatly enriched by their journey across the Irish Sea. On another level the naval venture was part of a carefully organized and fruitful national offensive in 1388 which involved simultaneous invasions of the western and eastern marches of England, culminating in victory for the Scottish eastern force at the battle of Otterburn. One repercussion of this battle was to propel Douglas into an even more prominent position among the aristocracy of Scotland. The second earl of Douglas died at Otterburn, and Archibald the Grim inherited the title and lands of the earldom. Douglas of Nithsdale was now the son of indisputably the most powerful magnate in southern Scotland.<br>
<br>Scotland's war effort, as fighting with England continued into 1389, was led by the third earl of Douglas and his political ally Robert Stewart, earl of Fife and Menteith and guardian of Scotland in the name of Robert II. In these circumstances it seems likely that Douglas of Nithsdale continued to fight on the marches, yet no details of his participation are known. We know, however, that a personal animosity rose at about this time between Douglas and Thomas, Lord Clifford. This may well have been connected to grants made by Edward I in 1298 and Edward Balliol in 1333, giving lands belonging to the Douglases to members of the Clifford family. Whether fundamentally territorial or not, the dispute was serious enough for Douglas to seek and receive English safe conducts in June 1390 for a judicial combat to be fought with Clifford. It is thought that the proposed duel was never fought, but Douglas went to France to buy armour for it and while he was there exchanged insults with Clifford, who accused him of cowardice.<br>
<br>The hostility between the two men was ultimately to have fatal consequences for Douglas when he was on crusade in the Baltic in 1391. He was in Bruges in December 1390, accompanied by other Scottish knights who had been his companions in the recent Anglo-Scottish conflict, and they were intending to be in Danzig by Easter 1391. Douglas probably took part in the summer <i>Reise</i> of the Teutonic knights, although Scottish chronicle accounts of his prominence in the fighting and of his status among the assembled chivalry cannot be relied upon. In any case it is entirely fitting that a figure whose career was founded on martial activity should have taken the well-worn path to the northern crusades when opportunities for fighting had dried up at home. Indeed, a fifteenth-century chronicler suggests that Douglas was a frequent crusader in the Baltic. The crusade of 1391 was to be his last. Some time between June and August of that year, according to the most reliable account, the Westminster chronicle, he and his party attempted to attend mass in K&ouml;nigsberg, but were turned away on the grounds of their adherence to Clement VII, the Avignon pope. Douglas blamed a group of English crusading knights for this rebuff. While the group was certainly associated with Clifford, he himself may not have been present. The Scots allegedly ambushed their English adversaries outside the church, and in the ensuing struggle Douglas was killed. The communal aristocratic ethos of the crusade had clearly been unable on this occasion to overcome personal and national animosities. Nor were the Scots and English alone in this, for other crusaders are recorded as involving themselves in the dispute. All were apparently supportive of the English cause, save only the French contingent.<br>
