<span class="headword">Winchester,  Elhanan</span>  (1751&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Universalist preacher</span>, was born on 30 September 1751 at Brookline, Massachusetts, the first child of Elhanan Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1810), farmer, and Sarah, the first of his three wives. His grandfather, John Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1694), had settled at Hingham in 1635. After beginning preaching in his home town, he joined in 1771 a local &#145;new light&#146; congregation in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Then he was baptized by immersion and ordained a Baptist preacher. When serving a racially mixed Calvinist Baptist church at Welch Neck, South Carolina, from 1775 to 1779 he condemned slavery in a sermon <span class="italic">The Reigning Abominations Especially the Slave Trade</span> (1788). From 1780 he was minister of a Philadelphia Baptist church. About this time he read Paul Siegvolk's <span class="italic">The Everlasting Gospel</span> (1753), published under the pseudonym of George Klein-Nicolai, which claimed God as all-powerful and all-benevolent, and as assuring universal restoration. His reading of Sir George Stonehouse's <span class="italic">The Restitution of All Things</span> (1761), combined with his personal acquaintance with the Universalist George de Benneville (1703&#150;1793), completed Winchester's conversion to Universalism. His church dismissed him, and he gathered a Universal Baptist congregation of which Benjamin Rush was a member.<br>
<br>By the mid-1780s Winchester had been married and bereaved four times. His first wife, Alice Rogers, died in April 1776, and in the same year he married Sarah Peck of Rehoboth, who lived only a few months after their marriage. In 1778 he married Sarah Luke of South Carolina, who died in 1779, and in 1781 he married a widow from Philadelphia, Mary Morgan, who died about 1783.<br>
<br>In 1787 Winchester unexpectedly left Philadelphia for England. Rush gave him letters of introduction to Richard Price (1723&#150;1791) and others. He also knew of a London Universalist group meeting in Southwark, one of whom had reprinted his sermon <span class="italic">The Outcast Comforted</span> (1783). In 1788 he published his best-known work, <span class="italic">The universal restoration: exhibited in a series of dialogues between a minister and his friend</span>. According to Winchester even &#145;The misery of the wicked shall end because the kingdom of evil shall end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Universal Restoration</span>, 4th edn, 1799, 37). The <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> were read widely and he received many letters of appreciation. Dan Taylor of the New Connexion General Baptists replied with <span class="italic">The Eternity of Future Punishment, Re-Asserted</span> (1800). Besides his <span class="italic">Dialogues</span>, Winchester published twenty-one items during his time in England, including ten sermons, a Universalist hymn book, and a periodical, <span class="italic">The Philadelphian</span> (1780).<br>
<br>In London, Winchester preached in meeting-houses in Blacksfields and Chapel Court, Southwark, in Moorfields, in Store Street, and in Boar's Head Yard, Petticoat Lane (1788&#150;9); for the Glass-House Yard General Baptist meeting at Worship Street (1790&#150;92); and at another meeting-house in Glass-House Yard itself. Late in 1792 he gathered a Universal Baptist congregation in a meeting-house in Parliament Court, Artillery Lane, Bishopgate. This congregation joined the General Baptist assembly in 1803, then became South Place Unitarian Chapel, Finsbury, and is now the South Place Ethical Society. Between 1788 and 1790 he preached in thirty-eight meeting-houses in England, eighteen of them in Kent, including Chatham, Canterbury, and Dover. He was twice in Cambridge, where he preached in Robert Robinson's Baptist meeting-house, and at Fleet and Wisbech in Lincolnshire. He also travelled to France.<br>
<br>In 1792 Winchester first met the Particular Baptist William Vidler of Battle, Kent, who was converted to Universalism by reading the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span>. Vidler had become his associate and successor at Parliament Court, when in May 1794 Winchester, troubled by the violence of his fifth wife, Maria Knowles, suddenly returned to America. English Universalist societies which originated under Winchester's influence first joined the General Baptist assembly, which had a compatible theology; by 1825, along with the General Baptists, they had all become Unitarian. By contrast most Universalist societies in America maintained a separate existence until their merger with the Unitarians in 1961.<br>
<br>Back in America, Winchester itinerated in New England and briefly returned to Philadelphia, where he allowed the Universalist Unitarian Joseph Priestley, whom he had met in London in 1793, to use his pulpit. He also published <span class="italic">Two Letters Addressed to Mr. Paine</span> (1795).<br>
<br>Winchester, a handsome man, was asthmatic all his life and died of tuberculosis, aged forty-six, on 18 April 1797 at Hartford, Connecticut, and was buried on 21 April, less than three years after his return to America. He had no survivors&#151;seven of his children were stillborn and an eighth, Reconcile, lived for only eighteen months&#151;except his disturbed fifth wife.<br>
