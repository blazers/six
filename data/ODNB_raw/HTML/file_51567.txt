<span class="headword">Plomer,  Henry Robert</span>  (1856&#150;1928), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was born on 13 December 1856 at Upper Rohais, Guernsey, the third son of George Daniel Plomer (1816&#150;1875) of Canterbury and his wife, Charlotte Amy Burrows of Dublin. His parents lived on a private income and spent the early years of their marriage in Dublin. Plomer began work at the age of nineteen as a bank clerk, but abandoned this to invest his small private income in a livery stable. The enterprise failed, and after writing short stories for small newspapers Plomer supported himself by copying work at the British Museum, the Public Record Office, and Somerset House. He spent most of his life in London, living mainly in Willesden. On 6 October 1884 he married Ellen Esther, the daughter of Thomas Young of Essex; they had two daughters and a son. Plomer's first substantial publication was <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Records of Canterbury</span> (1892); he published further material relating to Kent and Canterbury, where he worked in the recruiting office during the First World War, preparing four volumes relating to wills and to churchwardens' accounts for <span class="italic">Kent Records</span> between 1915 and 1927.<br>
<br>Plomer's contribution to scholarship in the emerging field of bibliography and the history of the printing trade in Great Britain was substantial and original. In 1892 he offered his services as secretary to the newly formed Bibliographical Society: although he was not appointed to the post, he began a long association with the society and especially with A. W. Pollard (1859&#150;1944). His earliest bibliographical publications were articles in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> in 1885 on English almanacs. These were followed in 1891 by an account in <span class="italic">The Library</span> of &#145;Literature of the plague&#146;: Plomer had wanted to compile a bibliography of early English books on the subject, but was persuaded instead to pursue his interest in the sixteenth-century printer Robert Wyer. A preliminary article in <span class="italic">The Library</span> in 1891 was expanded in 1895 into one of the first of the Bibliographical Society's small quarto publications, containing bibliographical descriptions of Wyer's books and an account of his types. Plomer contributed to six more of the society's volumes and wrote more than sixty articles for <span class="italic">The Library</span>, the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Bibliographical Society</span>, and <span class="italic">Bibliographica</span>, as well as pieces for <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. His most substantial contributions were to the series of dictionaries of printers and booksellers at work in England between 1501 and 1775: he was largely responsible for the volumes covering 1641 to 1667 (1907), 1668 to 1725 (1922), and 1726 to 1775 (1932), which was published posthumously. This biographical work suited Plomer's talents as a researcher among records, which also yielded the society's <span class="italic">Abstracts from the Wills of English Printers and Stationers from 1492 to 1630</span> (1903). His many articles, mostly about the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, showed how much could be uncovered about the history of the book trade through a systematic study of archives and records. Plomer's great knowledge of the relevant documents and his understanding of their importance can be illustrated by his being probably the first writer to draw on printers' ledgers, referring to those of Henry Woodfall in <span class="italic">A Short History of English Printing, 1476&#150;1898</span> (1900) and in 1901 publishing an article in <span class="italic">The Library</span> on the Whittingham ledgers.<br>
<br>When mechanical reproduction replaced copying by hand Plomer's finances suffered. At the inception of the <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue of English Books, 1475&#150;1640</span>, he was commissioned to report on the Bodleian's books and attempted to supplement his income by rapidly publishing three books: on <span class="italic">English Printers' Ornaments</span> (1924) and on Wynkyn de Worde (1925), which contain valuable material but were not well received, and on William Caxton (1925). An attempt to recognize the importance of his work and help him out financially by a civil-list pension was frustrated and rendered unnecessary by the death of his elder brother, who left him an inheritance. His long-standing interest in Edmund Spenser bore fruit in contributions relating to the latter's handwriting (1923) and in an edition with Tom Pete Crosse of the life and correspondence of Spenser's friend Lodowick Bryskett (1927). Just before he died, at London on 20 August 1928, Plomer was awarded a grant by the committee of the Royal Literary Fund.<br>
