<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tait,  Catharine</span>  (1819&#150;1878), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 9 December 1819 at Elmdon, near Rugby, Warwickshire, the youngest daughter of Anna Maria and William Spooner (1778?&#150;1857), rector of Elmdon and archdeacon of Coventry. Catharine Spooner was baptized by her father on 12 December 1819. Described as enthusiastic and earnest in her youth, she was brought up in the quiet surroundings of a country environment with few friends beyond her family circle. She was always to have a special love of the countryside. She read widely in English literature, history, and religion, and began to care for the sick and aged of the area. Evangelical by upbringing and religious habit, she was greatly influenced by her brother-in-law's Tractarianism, and retained a love of ceremonial and a sympathy for high-church devotion. In the first flush of her Tractarian commitment she heard that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26917/', "Archibald Campbell Tait (1811&#150;1882)")</script>, one of the Oxford tutors who had protested against Newman's <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>, had applied for the headmastership of Rugby School, and expressed the hope that he would not succeed.<br>
<br>Despite this apparent theological incompatibility, on 22 June 1843 Catharine Spooner married Tait, who had been appointed headmaster in 1842. Their relationship was extremely close and their religious life together mutually supportive. At Rugby Catharine Tait got to know the boys, helped her husband with his history lessons, learned German, ministered to the poor in the town, and established a school for girls. She also supervised the school accounts, demonstrating considerable business acumen in a role which she was to continue to fulfil in all her husband's subsequent posts, as well as in her own philanthropic work. Her life was very busy, but, according to her husband, &#145;She used to say that the Rugby time was the happiest of her life&#146;  (Benham, 30).<br>
<br>In 1849 Tait was appointed dean of Carlisle. In Carlisle Catharine Tait visited the local workhouse, taught in the school, and invited the poor to the deanery. The stay at Carlisle was marked by personal tragedy. In the spring of 1856 five daughters died from scarlet fever within six weeks; a son and daughter survived. (Two daughters were born later.) This was a devastating series of blows, but she found the strength to accept it as God's will even as she was going through the experience. She wrote a 139-page memorial account of the deaths of her daughters, intended originally for her family and friends. This was published at her request after her death. It was one of the most widely read Victorian books of consolation literature, and many bereaved parents wrote in gratitude to her widowed husband, one commenting on the way in which &#145;your sainted wife is fulfilling so precious a &#147;ministry of consolation&#148; still on earth&#146;  (W. H. Jellie to A. C. Tait, 27 Sept 1881; Jalland, 141&#150;2).<br>
<br>On moving to London in late 1856, when Tait was appointed bishop, Catharine Tait adapted her philanthropic and church work to the metropolitan context. She was particularly involved in the parishes of St James's and Fulham, although she tried to meet as many as possible of the London clergy. A wide range of clergy, statesmen, literary figures, and charity workers, together with their children, attended her summer garden parties at Fulham Palace. She read to people at workhouses and visited almshouses and hospitals. She was instrumental in the erection of a penitentiary, St James's House, on part of the episcopal estate at Fulham. Recognizing the need to systematize the organization of women's charitable work, she established the Ladies' Diocesan Association to bring together women involved in Christian social work. The organization gave women, including those of status and influence, an opportunity to work among the sick, outcast, and lonely in hospitals, penitentiaries, and workhouses. During the 1866 cholera epidemic she visited hospitals and provided temporary shelter for the victims, and also worked with Catherine Gladstone (1812&#150;1900) and Catherine Marsh (1818&#150;1912) to set up homes for the orphans of the epidemic. She established St Peter's Orphanage for the girls, based for five years at Fulham and then in a larger house built by her on of the Isle of Thanet, raising all the necessary funds herself. To the latter she added a convalescent home for women and children. In order to secure the future of the orphanage, she set up a scheme of Children's Associates, an organization of upper-class women who each contributed towards the maintenance of an individual orphan while at the orphanage, thereafter continuing to be a personal mentor to the child in later life. She herself visited the orphanage as often as possible, and the sisters of St Peter's, Kilburn, helped to run it. The girls were taught by a qualified schoolteacher and were also trained in domestic service; some later went into nursing or schoolteaching. After 1869, when her husband became archbishop of Canterbury, Catharine Tait continued to work on these projects, as well as ministering to the poor in Lambeth: she sent them gifts of food, contributed funds to charities, and held a yearly garden party for them.<br>
<br>Another family tragedy struck in 1878, when the Taits' only son, the Revd Craufurd Tait, died on 29 May after a protracted illness. Catharine Tait never really recovered from the shock of losing her beloved son and companion, to whom she was especially devoted. She visited Scotland with her husband and three daughters to regain her health, but she suffered a bilious attack and died a week later, on 1 December 1878, in Great Stuart Street, Edinburgh, with her husband at her bedside. She was buried at Addington parish church, Surrey, on 7 December. Her husband pronounced the benediction. In his memoirs Archbishop Tait wrote, &#145;Thus ended her earthly life of fifty-nine years&#151;refreshed from her childhood onwards, through the grace of God, by a wellspring of joy within, which poured forth in acts of kindliness to all whom she could reach&#146;  (Benham, 196).<br>
<br>Catharine Tait believed that wealth and influence carried responsibilities, and as the wife of a prominent churchman she used her position to support and to organize more effectively a traditional style of philanthropic work among the less fortunate and orphans. An attractive woman of great charm, she clearly inspired devotion, and was memorialized in reverential tones. Immediately following her death a resolution from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge praised her valuable contributions to the church, and she was later included in J. Johnson's <span class="italic">Noble Women of our Time</span> (1882).<br>
