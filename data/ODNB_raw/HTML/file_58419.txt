<span class="headword">Robertson,  Isabella <span class="st"> [Bell]</span></span>  (1841&#150;1922), <span class="occ">ballad collector</span>, was born on 1 February 1841 at her father's croft, Denhead of Boyndlie, Buchan, Aberdeenshire. She was the eldest of five children and only daughter of James Robertson and his wife, Jean Gall, of Strichen, Aberdeenshire. Bell's mother, her sister, and their mother (Bell's grandmother) each had a wide repertory of songs, with many of which Bell became familiar. Although Bell herself was no singer, she had a great love of the songs, and was thus responsible for preserving many of their number, displaying her extraordinary power and precision of memory. She attended a dame-school, run by Janet Taylor, who earned her living chiefly by spinning, and who was herself a tradition-bearer. Bell extended her range from Janet Taylor and from some of the other pupils, girls who were singers or the daughters of singers. Bell also added to her collection at &#145;meal-and-ales&#146; (harvest home celebrations); she puts on record, for instance, one song heard on such an occasion when she was &#145;about 14&#146;, another when she was &#145;about 18&#146;  (Keith, 249, 273). Travelling people, tinkers, were also a source. &#145;They used to camp beside my mother's house and the children came to beg, and my brothers, who were boys at the time, used to ask them to sing&#146;  (ibid., 251). She found it difficult to make out the words in their singing, perhaps because it was in a style more ornamented than that of the local farming community.<br>
<br>Bell afterwards spent five and a half years in Glasgow as housekeeper to her four brothers, one of whom was to become a minister of the Free Church in Argyll. Afterwards she returned home to help her mother, after whose death she went into service. For fourteen and a half years she was housekeeper to Alexander Mackie, an invalid with one arm, first at Mill Aden, then in a two-roomed cottage at one of the lodges of Aden House, Aberdeenshire. Her yearly wage was &pound;2, with keep. When her health broke down she retired to New Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire. Encouraged by Mrs Frank Russell of Aden, in 1906 she published a volume of verse, <span class="italic">Lays of Buchan</span>.<br>
<br>At New Pitsligo, Gavin Greig and the Revd J. B. Duncan made Bell's acquaintance. In 1904 they had been commissioned to prepare a volume of local traditional music, predominantly song tunes, but had found it impossible to dissociate the music from the words. Bell remembered words by way of the tunes, giving as excuse for her imperfect recollection of a broadside text, &#145;It was the tunes that fixd the old songs in my memory&#146;  (Lyle, 324). Greig found in her his most important single source: she contributed 383 items to the collection. She was also a shrewd commentator; in the Greig&#150;Duncan MSS she has two volumes of ballad notes, two of song notes, and one of letters to Duncan. She has been rightly called &#145;the most voluminous transmitter of ballads in the history of ballad-collecting&#146;  (Keith, 289). Bell Robertson died at 7 High Street, New Pitsligo, at the age of eighty-one on 19 August 1922.<br>
