<span class="headword">Marianus Scotus</span> <span class="st"> [Moelbrigte]</span>  (1028&#150;1082), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and chronicler</span>, was a native of Ireland. His true name was Moelbrigte, and he became a monk in 1052 at Moville, Down, during the abbacy of Tigernach Bairrech (<i>d</i>. 1061). Having left Ireland, he entered the Irish monastery of St Martin at Cologne on Thursday 1 August 1056. On 12 April 1058 he left Cologne for Fulda, was ordained priest by Abbot Siegfried of Fulda on 13 March 1059 at W&uuml;rzburg, and on 14 May following became a recluse at Fulda. There he remained for ten years until on 3 April 1069 he left Fulda by command of Siegfried, now archbishop of Mainz, and on 10 July 1069 settled at Mainz, still as a recluse, where he remained in the monastery of St Alban the Martyr until his death, which is said to have occurred on 22 December 1082.<br>
<br>Marianus composed a universal chronicle, in the tradition of Jerome and Bede, extending from the beginning of mankind to his own lifetime. He thought that the Dionysian date of Christ's nativity was twenty-two years too late, and so dated his annals in two ways, according to his own chronology (&#145;in conformity with the gospel&#146;), and according to that of Dionysius, and appended tables and arguments in support of his theory; but even in his own time, says William of Malmesbury, he had but few supporters.<br>
<br>The chronicle contains some fifty or sixty references to Britain and Ireland. Down to 725 these are largely extracted from Bede; the later ones refer mostly to Marianus himself, to Irish monks, and to the ecclesiastical history of East Francia. In its earlier portion the chronicle is a compilation from various sources, and the part that relates to the writer's own time is very brief. John of Worcester adopted Marianus as the basis of his own chronicle, and through this source the work became familiar to English writers, who, indeed, often cite John under the name of Marianus. In Germany the chronicle of Marianus was not so widely known, though Sigebert of Gembloux made extensive use of it. The chief manuscript of Marianus is Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Pal. lat. 830, a fair copy that was almost certainly written for him by Irish hands, and which he very probably revised himself. There were at least three stages in its compilation, one in 1072&#150;3, a second in 1076, and a third in 1082. The second main witness, BL, Cotton MS Nero C.v, a German twelfth-century manuscript, represents a redaction made in Germany shortly after Marianus's death, and was the version used by John of Worcester. The Vatican manuscript was taken by Waitz for his text of book 3 only in the <span class="roman">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</span>, 5.495&#150;562. Books 1 and 3 were printed at Basel in 1559 from a mutilated manuscript; this is followed in the editions of Pistorius (1601) and of Struvius (1726).<br>
