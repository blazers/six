<span class="headword">Holt,  William</span>  (1545&#150;1599), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born on 28 September 1545 at Ashworth, Lancashire. He was privately educated before attending Oxford between 1562 and 1572. He took his BA and MA degrees at Oxford, and then converted to Catholicism. He was at Douai in 1574 to study theology. After his ordination he continued his studies in Rome until 8 November 1578, when he entered the Society of Jesus.<br>
<br>Robert Persons sent Holt in the summer of 1581 to minister to the Catholics of northern England, and subsequently asked him to meet a secular priest, William Watts, for discussions with Catholic lords at Edinburgh in December. Over the next six months Holt learned of the ambitious plans of Lennox and a group of Catholic peers, which required his return to London to brief the Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, in February 1582. He then travelled north to Dalkeith in March to meet Lennox and a Scottish Jesuit, William Crichton. In April the two Jesuits went to France to see William Allen, the duke of Guise, Persons, and other Catholic exiles. At this stage the leaders, hoping for the conversion of the young James VI, were presuming strong financial backing from the pope and Philip II for foreign troops, and an active role for the Catholics of Scotland and England in a vague &#145;enterprise&#146; in the north to secure their own freedom. Since many problems remained to be resolved, Holt went back to Scotland in June 1582 to visit recusants in safe areas. He was initially assisted by Alexander Gordon, twelfth earl of Sutherland; later he turned to George, fifth Lord Seton, to minister to families in the south-east. William Allen was impressed by this early success.<br>
<br>Aware of Holt's priesthood, the English ambassador, Robert Bowes, arrested him at Leith in March 1583 and brought him to King James, who was at Edinburgh Castle in the hands of the &#145;Ruthven raiders&#146;. For months a tug-of-war went on between the king and the ambassador, who insisted that Holt be handed over to be tried in England. Since James refused Bowes asked to interrogate him &#145;intensely&#146;&#151;a euphemism for torture if needed&#151;at which the French ambassador, the sieur de Mainville, protested. Asserting his independence, on 27 April James assured Henri III: &#145;William Holt will not receive any harm &hellip; nor be transported into England, nor placed under any other authority &hellip; but mine&#146;  (Hicks, 202 n. 5). After James's liberation from the raiders, he adroitly connived at Holt's escape from the castle, to the chagrin of Bowes. Equally valuable for Holt was the personal safe conduct from King James, which enabled him to prolong his stay in Scotland. In June 1584 Persons wrote: &#145;Holt is very well in Scotland, secured against the ministers by the public protection of the king&#146;, and still hopeful for a conversion &#145;of this young man&#146;  (Hicks, 213).<br>
<br>From then on Holt looked for a friendly Scottish peer as a patron, although upon his release Seton advised him to return to France. Instead, Holt went north with George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, visiting other Catholic enclaves, and later toured Dumfriesshire with help from John Maxwell, earl of Morton. This itinerary sheds light on the survival of recusancy in Scotland despite the kirk's hostility. As there was no clear leader of the Catholic minority Holt sought a peer with local influence who could protect him. He was convinced of the staunch belief of the peers he met, although some, such as Huntly, practised occasional conformity. Similarly, his personal encounters with James led him to expect a tolerance of Catholics, but the king found it expedient to change this policy. In March 1586 Holt left Scotland for good since Persons required his diplomatic skill in Rome.<br>
<br>For the next year and a half, as rector of the English College, Holt tried to appease a student faction critical of Allen and Persons for their Hispanophile preference and neglect of the imprisoned queen of Scots. Since Holt was well aware of the Scottish scene no quarrels erupted. Then in early 1588 Holt and Joseph Creswell were called to Flanders to serve as chaplains in Parma's army. After the failure of the Armada, Creswell went back to Rome but Holt stayed in Flanders as a military chaplain for ten years. Assisted by Henry Walpole in 1590&#150;91 he paid visits to companies of English, Irish, and Italian soldiers deployed in the siege warfare against the Dutch forces. During these years in service Holt saw the morale of the entire army plummet, due to the failure to provide back pay and vital supplies, so that scattered mutinies occurred as well as desertions. Holt also regularly visited the court of the governor-general in Brussels to seek the arrears of pensions due to English exiles, who were paid from a near empty treasury of the army. At length, in 1596, Holt with two others prepared a list of the names of known pensioners, citing their years of service and the arrears due to them, and commenting on their loyalty to the crown; this was sent to Madrid. However, the crown's bankruptcy, the illness of Philip II, and greater problems elsewhere prevented relief at that time.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Holt wrote, probably at the request of his friend Richard Barret, president of Douai College, a lengthy advisory essay in Latin, entitled &#145;How the Catholic religion was maintained in England&#146;; it chronicled the survival of the Catholic clergy since 1559 and suggested how their lot might be improved. He stressed that new leadership was needed by appointing an English prelate in Rome, with a second in England to provide confirmation for the faithful, guidance for the clergy, and chrism for the sacraments. However, Clement VIII did not consider it then prudent to nominate prelates from the English clergy, subsequently preferring an archpriest. For those preparing for ordination in the colleges Holt urged closer scrutiny both before admission and during studies, which seemed to aim at reducing the disruptive factions. Lastly, because of the higher numbers of priests and students travelling in Flanders, he advised that a priest should be designated to assist them in their needs, but none could be spared to do it.<br>
<br>Since Holt had become prominent as a leader among the exiles and at the court of Archduke Albert by this time, Charles Paget, widely known as an indefatigable opponent of the Jesuits, sent an accusation with thirty-six charges of abuses of power by Holt to the archduke and the pope. When visiting Rome, Barret was astounded when Clement VIII asked about &#145;a certain Jesuit father who dominates there and tyrannizes&#146;, so that he returned at once to Douai to gather a large number of signatures in support of Holt. The career of Paget, as an informant of the court of Elizabeth and a troublesome divisive presence in Flanders, was familiar to many Catholics, but not to the unsuspecting archduke, who conferred with Oliver Mannaerts, the Jesuit superior, and Juan Baptista de Tassis, a veteran diplomat. After close questioning they exonerated Holt of all charges, but he later commented: &#145;I never lost even one hour's sleep in the midst of all that tumult&#146;. He continued to serve as a military chaplain with the additional post of vice-prefect of the English Jesuits in Flanders after April 1598. In November he set out for Spain but first visited Milan in January 1599 to meet Archduke Albert. This proved to be his final discussion of the problems of the English in Flanders, for he died about 25 May 1599, probably during an epidemic, at Barcelona, where he was buried, probably that month.<br>
