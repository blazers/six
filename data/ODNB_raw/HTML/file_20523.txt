<span class="headword">O'Connor <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Conner, Connor]</span>,  Roger</span>  (1762&#150;1834), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, born at Connorville, co. Cork, was the son of Roger Conner (<i>d</i>. 1798) of Connorville, MP for Bandonbridge, co. Cork, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1782), daughter of Robert Longfield MP, and sister of Richard Longfield, first Viscount Longueville. The Connor or, more correctly, Conner family was descended from a rich London merchant, and its claims to ancient Irish descent were totally spurious. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20509/', "Arthur O'Connor")</script>, the leading United Irishman, was Roger's younger brother and they were the only two of the nine children in the family to change their name to O'Connor. Roger entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1777, and was called to the English bar in 1784.<br>
<br>O'Connor's early bias was in favour of the old tory regime; as a young man he entered the Muskerry yeomanry, and helped to hunt down &#145;Whiteboys&#146;. He soon, however, changed his views and, with his brother Arthur, joined the United Irishmen, in which he displayed some gifts for organization; he was involved in setting up the short-lived radical newspaper <span class="italic">The Harp of Eirinn</span>. In 1797 a warrant left Dublin Castle for his arrest, at the instance of his own brother Robert, who was an inveterate enemy of his two errant brothers. He was imprisoned at Cork, was tried and acquitted. On his liberation in April 1798 he went to London, with the intention, as he said, of &#145;residing there and avoiding any interference in politics&#146;; but his brother Arthur had just been arrested at Margate, and the Home Office again decided on imprisoning Roger. He was sent from place to place in the custody of king's messengers, and on 2 June 1798 was finally committed to Newgate in Dublin.<br>
<br>In April 1799, with his fellow prisoners T. A. Emmet, Chambers, his brother Arthur, and others, O'Connor was moved to Fort George in Scotland. In the same year he managed to publish <span class="italic">Letters to the People of Great Britain</span>. After some years' imprisonment, during which his health suffered, he obtained an early release. While the brothers were in prison, the family home at Connorville had been looted by government forces who had lived there at free quarters during the rebellion, but Roger's claim for damages (&pound;681 8<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., including &pound;10 15<i>s</i>. for grapes and other fruit) was disallowed. He renewed the claim in 1811, though this time the sum in question had grown to &pound;2190: once again he failed to get compensation. In the meantime, he had rented Dangan Castle, Trim, co. Meath: this house burnt down shortly after he had taken out insurance for &pound;5000 on it. As a result of Arthur's exile in France, Roger had been given by him full power of attorney to deal with his Irish property, but after an early remittance of &pound;500 nothing further was sent. By the time that Arthur realized that he was being swindled, some, if not most, of the property had gone. At the end of the Napoleonic wars, and still unable to travel to Ireland himself, Arthur sent his wife, Eliza, daughter of the marquis de Condorcet, to confront Roger, but he proved adept at suppressing documentary evidence and she was forced to return empty-handed to France. Eventually a decree against Roger was obtained in the courts, but this had little value. In a sensational development, he was arrested at Trim in 1817 for having headed a band of his retainers in robbing the Galway coach. The son of O'Connor's agent later asserted that this raid was made by O'Connor not for money, but in quest of a packet of love letters written by his friend Sir Francis Burdett, which were likely to be used in evidence against Burdett at the suit of a peer who suspected him of criminal intimacy with his wife. Sir Francis Burdett hurried to Ireland as a witness on O'Connor's behalf at his trial at Trim, and Roger was acquitted.<br>
<br>In 1822 O'Connor published <span class="italic">The chronicles of Eri, being the history of the Gael, Sciot Iber, or Irish people: translated from the original manuscripts in the Phoenician dialect of the Scythian language</span>. The book is mainly, if not entirely, the fruit of O'Connor's imagination. Roger's portrait is prefixed with the description, &#145;O'Connor Cier-rige, head of his race, and O'Connor, chief of the prostrated people of this Nation. <i>Soumis, pas vaincus</i>.&#146; O'Connor is described as a man of fascinating manners and conversation, and he certainly made an impression on Sir Francis Burdett, but R. R. Madden, the biographer of the United Irishmen, considered that his wits were always more or less disordered. Throughout his life he professed himself to be a sceptic in religion, and declared that Voltaire was his god. He married, first, in 1784, Louisa Ann, daughter of Colonel Strachan; and second, in 1788, Wilhelmina, daughter of Nicholas Bowen of Bowenscourt. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98241/', "Francisco O'Connor")</script>, the supporter of South American independence movements, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20515/', "Feargus O'Connor")</script>, the Chartist, were sons of the second marriage. O'Connor died at his home, Knockenmore Cottage, Kilcrea, co. Cork, on 27 January 1834, and was buried in Kilcrea Abbey.<br>
