<span class="headword">Delattre <span class="st"> [Delatre]</span>,  Jean Marie</span>  (1745&#150;1840), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born at Abbeville, France. He was a pupil of J. P. Le Bas and had already composed some small portrait engravings in Paris before coming to England in 1770 to work for William Wynne Ryland. He showed with the Society of Arts in that year when he was living opposite the Mother Red Cap in Kentish Town, London&#151;Fran&ccedil;ois Ravenet's address&#151;and a year later was publishing in partnership with Ravenet's son-in-law Victor Marie Picot. He apparently returned to Paris shortly before 1773, where he produced two portraits and worked for the printsellers Esnauts and Rapilly, but after this date he settled in London, and on 18 February 1773 married Ann Davis (<i>d</i>. 1834) at St Anne, Soho. Two daughters survived him: Charlotte May (1780&#150;1851) and Juliet Ann (<i>b</i>. 1783).<br>
<br>From 1779 Delattre engraved for a variety of printsellers including Anne Bryer, and also for Francis Bartolozzi. Early prints after Kaufmann for Bartolozzi are signed &#145;Delattre sculps. Bartolozzi direxit&#146;. Later he became Bartolozzi's principal assistant and was responsible for much of the work bearing Bartolozzi's signature. He also worked for booksellers, making portraits and vignettes for <span class="italic">London Theatre</span> (1776) and portraits for Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Works of the English Poets</span> (1779). Occasionally he engraved in line rather than in stipple, as in his work for Bell's <span class="italic">British Theatre</span>.<br>
<br>About 1800 the American painter John Singleton Copley commissioned Delattre to produce a line-engraving at a reduced scale of Bartolozzi's large plate <span class="italic">Death of the Earl of Chatham</span>, which depicted fifty-six members of the House of Lords, and for which Bartolozzi had received &pound;2000. Copley agreed to pay &pound;800, with an advance of &pound;220, but he was dissatisfied with the resulting print and refused further payment. Delattre brought an action in king's bench to recover the balance. The trial on 2 July 1801 occupied the entire day; Delattre called fourteen witnesses, who declared that the sixty portraits depicted were all good likenesses, and that the print was worth at least &pound;800. Copley's twelve witnesses considered the likenesses to be poor. The jury found for Delattre, who received the outstanding &pound;580. <span class="italic">The Times</span> later commented that the real defect of the print was that it depicted equally strong likenesses in all lights and at all distances.<br>
<br>Delattre and his family resided in one of the small houses known as St John's Villas, on North End Road, Fulham, London. A watercolour, now in the British Museum, was made of Delattre one year before his death on 30 June 1840. The inscription on his tomb in Fulham churchyard declares that he was in his ninety-eighth year, which would have brought his birth forward to 1742 or 1743. His wife, who died in 1834 aged eighty-four, and his eldest daughter, who died in 1851 aged seventy-one, are also commemorated on this tomb.<br>
