<span class="headword">Cookson family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1700&#150;1863), <span class="occ">industrialists and bankers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_49068"></a><span class="headword">Isaac Cookson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1679, <em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">glass and iron manufacturer</span>, who was baptized in Penrith on 3 March 1679, the third of seven children of William Cookson (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;1712), a brazier, and his wife, Alice. William was occasionally cautioned for religious dissent and non-attendance at church. By 1704 Isaac had moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where he became a merchant adventurer; however, nothing is known of the details of his early business interests. He married Hannah Buston (1681/2&#150;1760) on 6 April 1709, but no details of her family, or of when their five children were born, are extant. The Cookson family worshipped at the Hanover Square congregation of dissenters, founded by Richard Gilpin before 1700.<br>
<br>By 1721 Isaac Cookson was established in the iron trade. In that year he entered into partnerships, first with his eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_49067"></a><span class="headword">William Cookson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1668, <em>d.</em> 1744)<span class="occ"></span>, and second with Joseph Button, a Gateshead stationer in whose house Daniel Defoe stayed during his <span class="italic">Tour through the Whole Island</span>. The brothers' partnership was for the building of an iron furnace at Little Clifton, near Workington, on land leased from Lord Lonsdale. The furnace was supplied with water power from the River Marrow, ironstone from Branthwaite, and coal from Cookson's mines at Clifton and Greysouthen. The ironworks appears to have been a success. The lease was renegotiated in 1735 for &pound;240 for a further twenty-one years and, in 1750, the lessors considered the works to be &#145;carrying on to very great proffit for the casting and making of Pots and other Uttensals of cast iron&#146;  (Hedley and Hudleston, 13&#150;14).<br>
<br>Isaac Cookson's original partnership with Joseph Button concerned the leasing, in March 1721, of a founding house for casting iron and brass wares at the east end of old Trunk Staith, Gateshead, from William Cotesworth. The partnership was later extended for thirty-one years from 1 September 1729, the partners agreeing to share the &#145;art, trade and mystery of carrying on iron foundries at Clifton [Cumberland], Gateshead and Newcastle&#146;  (Hedley and Hudleston, 25). The capital employed was &pound;4800, of which Cookson's share was &pound;3900.<br>
<br>The first evidence of Isaac Cookson's interests in glass manufacturing is in 1728, when he entered into partnership with Joseph Airey, a Newcastle mercer and fellow member of the Hanover Square congregation. Airey, Cookson &amp; Co. took over the Dagnia flint glasshouse in the Closegate, Newcastle, after the death of Onesiphorus Dagnia. This glasshouse was still operating as Airey, Cookson &amp; Co. in 1801. In the late 1730s Isaac Cookson was part of a separate partnership to develop a crown glasshouse at Bill Quay, South Shields, on land he had originally leased in 1722, and appears to have acted as a sleeping partner in this enterprise by leasing the land for building. The main partners were his eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_49070">John Cookson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Thomas Jeffreys and James Dixon, merchants of Snow Hill, London, and Francis Hawkes the elder, a glassmaker of Vane Hall, Surrey. This partnership appears to have been reinforced by marriage: James Dixon married Isaac Cookson's daughter Hannah in 1738. By 1740 the partnership was advertising the best crown glass to be sold at its London warehouse, the Old Swan, London Bridge.<br>
<br>Isaac Cookson died in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1743 and his brother William a year later, in 1744. It is not known how the Little Clifton ironworks partnership was continued after their deaths. In his will, drawn up on 13 November 1740, Isaac Cookson left &#145;all and every my goods and chattels, rights and credits&#146; to his son John Cookson, who was his sole executor, with the &#145;special condition, trust and confidence&#146;  (Hedley and Hudleston, 20) that annual payments of &pound;80 be made to his widow during her lifetime. Hannah was also to have the family's silver plate, linen, beds, and other furniture, although she was required to release her dower money to her son within three months of her husband's death. Isaac Cookson's other sons, Isaac and Joseph, were to receive &pound;2000 and a one-eighth part of the crown glasshouse at South Shields plus its stock, money, debts, glass bottles, pots, clay work, and tools. His daughters, Sarah Cookson and Hannah Dixon, were to receive &pound;1200 and &pound;300 respectively.<br>
<br>William Cookson, who was baptized in Penrith on 25 November 1668, had two sons and four daughters with his first wife, Esther Wren, whom he married on 30 December 1691 and who died soon after the birth of their youngest child in 1705. No children were born of his second marriage, on 5 August 1708, to Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1736), widow of John Stenhouse. William Cookson was buried in Penrith on 25 December 1744. Of the five elder children nothing is known. However, the youngest child, <a name="cosubject_49069"></a><span class="headword">Isaac Cookson</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1705, <em>d.</em> 1754)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized in Penrith on 11 November 1705, became a notable Newcastle goldsmith, being apprenticed, in 1720, to Francis Batty, and taking over Batty's shop, the Gold Ring, in The Side, following his master's death in 1728. In the 1740s Cookson became a partner in an ultimately unsuccessful lead smelting and refining partnership. This involved mining and smelting lead at Acton Burn, Blanchland, and refining lead and silver at Elswick, Newcastle. Cookson negotiated the lease for the Elswick refining house for fourteen years from May 1743, but it was apparently not renewed after his death. On 23 May 1734 Isaac Cookson married Susanna Gilpin (<i>d</i>. 1746) of Whitehaven. They had one daughter, Esther (<i>b</i>. 1737). Isaac Cookson died intestate in 1754 and was buried at Newcastle upon Tyne on 22 August 1754.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49070"></a><span class="headword">John Cookson</span>  (1712/13?&#150;1783), <span class="occ">merchant, glass and iron manufacturer, mine owner, and banker</span>, was the eldest son of Isaac Cookson (<i>d</i>. 1743) and Hannah Buston. His date and place of birth are unknown, although it seems likely that he was born in Newcastle in 1712 or 1713. On 9 February 1728 he was apprenticed to Joseph Airey, a mercer and his father's partner in the Closegate flint glasshouse. John Cookson was enrolled by the Merchant Adventurers on 13 March 1728 and given his freedom on 27 April 1738. Prior to this, on 20 January 1736, he was granted leave to travel to improve his skills.<br>
<br>John Cookson's first known business venture was in 1738 as a partner in the South Shields crown glasshouse. Prior to 1740 he sold, for &pound;375 paid by their father, a sixteenth share in the business to his brother Joseph. Joseph Cookson was living in South Shields in 1740 and may have managed the family's business interests there, which included salt pans and a ballast quay as well as the glasshouse. In 1746 John and Joseph Cookson were listed among the six owners of the plate and crown glasshouse and salt pans at South Shields.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1743, immediately after he had inherited his father's estate and thus become a wealthy man, John Cookson married Elizabeth, daughter of Walter Lutwidge of Whitehaven. Reputedly, as part of the marriage settlement, Cookson bought an estate at Whitehill, near Chester-le-Street. Here, in partnership with John Button, the son of his father's iron trade partner, he built a blast furnace with the intention of coking local coal and making steel. In the long term, as a steel works, Whitehill was unsuccessful, although, as a foundry, it successfully made high quality cannon in the 1780s. Despite this, in the 1750s Whitehill was part of Cookson's diverse industrial interests which made him one of the most important businessmen in the region. His letters of this period demonstrate a mature grasp of these businesses, which included salt and alum refining and coal and lead mining as well as iron and glass making. These interests extended from Newcastle and South Shields to Chester-le-Street, Hexham, Cumberland, and north Yorkshire, and included Newcastle's trade with London and Glasgow.<br>
<br>By the mid-1750s John Cookson's status as a wealthy businessman of varied interests led him to become one of four partners in Newcastle's first bank. This was established in Pilgrim Street in 1755, the prime mover being a fellow Newcastle merchant, Ralph Carr. Joseph Airey, Cookson's apprentice master and partner in the Closegate glasshouse, was also a partner. By a deed of co-partnership, drawn up for ten years from 1 January 1756, each partner was to provide paid-up capital of &pound;500. This investment was substantially repaid in profits&#151;Cookson is estimated to have made &pound;880 in 1758, &pound;823 in 1771, and &pound;1250 in 1776.<br>
<br>It is not, therefore, surprising that, in drawing up his will in 1774, having left his banking interests to his eldest son, Isaac (1745&#150;1831), and his estates and mines to his wife in her lifetime, then to Isaac, Cookson was able to make very generous financial provisions for five of his six younger children. John Cookson (1754&#150;1802), who subsequently became a London barrister, Thomas Cookson (1757&#150;1775), of the Indian Civil Service, who died before his father, and Joseph Cookson (1763&#150;1800), who subsequently became a captain in the Life Guards, were to receive &pound;10,000 each. The two unmarried daughters, Hannah, who subsequently married Richard Ellison, MP for Lincoln, and Sarah, were to receive &pound;5000 each. There was no legacy to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, whose portion probably went to her on marriage to a London banker, Samuel Castell, in 1769.<br>
<br>John Cookson died on 17 December 1783; his will was proved in London on 19 April 1784. His eldest son retired from what had become known as the &#145;Old Bank&#146; in 1796. However, the family's interests in the coal, glass, and iron industries prospered in the early nineteenth century. Isaac Cookson's estate was valued at &pound;300,000 in 1846. Three of his sons&#151;John Cookson (1773&#150;1857), of Whitehill, Isaac Cookson (1776&#150;1851), of Meldon Park, Northumberland, and Thomas Cookson (1779&#150;1863), of The Hermitage, Chester-le-Street&#151;became landed industrialists, creating the basis for further diversification of the Cookson family's industrial interests in the latter part of the century. However, the key figure in the Cookson family's business affairs, and indeed one of the key figures in the business history of north-east England, was John Cookson. His achievements were to diversify his father's broadening industrial interests, ensure a landed base, create new business opportunities with existing partners, develop financial stability via banking, and provide for his younger children's futures by marriage and/or careers in the established professions. No great eighteenth-century magnate could have done more.<br>
