<span class="headword">Gass,  Ian Graham</span>  (1926&#150;1992), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 20 March 1926 at 273 Whitehall Road, Gateshead, co. Durham, the son of John George Gass, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Lilian Robinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peacock. Because his father worked abroad Gass was brought up by an aunt in Gateshead until the family returned to England at the beginning of the Second World War and settled in Huddersfield. He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, transferring to the Free Grammar School of King James, Almondbury, Huddersfield, before joining the Royal Navy in 1944. The war ended before he finished his training as a Fleet Air Arm pilot, and he spent the next two years in Malaya in the Royal Army Service Corps, leaving with the rank of captain. He entered the University of Leeds, where William Quarrier Kennedy was professor of geology, and after graduating with a BSc in geology in 1953 he joined the staff of the Sudan geological survey. On 2 July 1955 he married (Florence) Mary Pearce (<i>b</i>. 1930/31), secretary, and daughter of Arthur Pearce, farmer, of Bamford, near Rochdale, Lancashire; they had a daughter, Katherine, and a son, Graham. He spent the next five years working for the Cyprus geological survey until the growth of the EOKA movement made field mapping dangerous: his work in the Troodos Mountains formed the basis of his Leeds PhD, awarded in 1960.<br>
<br>In 1960 Gass was appointed assistant lecturer at the University of Leicester, returning to Leeds in 1961 as a lecturer. He led the Royal Society expedition in 1962 to investigate the eruption of the volcanic island of Tristan da Cunha, and another Royal Society expedition to investigate volcanoes in southern Arabia in 1964: he published his findings in a chapter in <span class="italic">African Magmatism and Tectonics</span> (1970), which he co-edited, dedicated to Kennedy, who had set up the Research Institute of African Geology at Leeds in 1955. In 1963 he became a member of the Royal Society volcanology subcommittee, which he chaired from 1971 to 1979. His discovery that the Troodos complex in Cyprus was oceanic made a significant contribution to the theory of plate tectonics, which in the 1960s revolutionized ideas of the formation of the earth's crust, and he went on to investigate areas of similar rocks in Oman, bringing together the results in <span class="italic">Ophiolites and the Ocean Lithosphere</span> (1984).<br>
<br>In 1969 Gass was appointed foundation professor of earth sciences at the Open University, set up by the Labour government to provide distance learning. He prepared the earth sciences section of the science foundation course, first offered in 1971, and with his team wrote the introductory text, <span class="italic">Understanding the Earth</span> (1971), the first textbook on earth sciences to be published after the plate tectonics revolution: this was widely used in British universities, and the third edition was published in 1992, with a new preface written by Gass. He developed three Open University courses in the 1970s: the introductory course, &#145;Geology&#146;, first offered in 1972, for which all students were sent thousands of specimens of rocks, and plaster casts of fossils, together with a collapsible microscope; &#145;The earth's physical resources&#146; (1974); and &#145;Oceanography&#146; (1977). He chose the University of Leeds as the venue for the very popular Open University summer schools in earth sciences, and when the Open University Geological Society, one of the largest student societies, was set up he was invited to become president. Very successful at attracting funding for advanced analytical equipment he was able to build up a research centre with an international reputation, especially for vulcanological studies, and the department of earth sciences became one of the leading departments of the Open University. In 1982 he gave up his position as head of department, accepting a personal chair, in order to devote more time to research. He retired in 1991.<br>
<br>Gass was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1983, and was president of the International Association for Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior from 1983 to 1987. He was awarded the Prestwich medal of the Geological Society of London in 1979, and the Murchison medal in 1988. He underwent a coronary by-pass operation in 1981 and suffered a stroke in 1987, from which he gradually recovered; he died on 8 October 1992 in Bedford General Hospital, following another stroke and was buried eight days later. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
