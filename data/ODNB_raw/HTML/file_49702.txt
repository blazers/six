<span class="headword">Chute,  James Henry</span>  (1808<span class="mult">x</span>10&#150;1878), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was almost certainly the son of Stephen and Jane Chew (or Chute) baptized at Alverstoke, Hampshire, on 21 August 1808, although his birth is sometimes reported as having taken place at nearby Gosport on 4 July 1810. His first recorded appearance on the stage was at the Bristol Theatre Royal in 1829, during the management of Richard Brunton, and he later played in stock companies on the Lincoln and York circuits before going to the Theatre Royal, Dublin, in the late 1830s. In September 1839 Chute returned to the Bristol Theatre Royal, by then managed by Sarah Macready (or McCready, or M'Cready), the stepmother of the tragedian William Charles Macready, and he divided his time between Bristol and Dublin until 1844, when he advantageously married Mrs Macready's daughter Mazzarina Emily (1824/5&#150;1878). In the following year Mrs Macready took on the additional lease of the Bath Theatre Royal, and in 1848 Chute leased the Bath assembly rooms, where the provision of entertainment consisted principally of balls, card assemblies, concerts, oratorios, exhibitions of panoramas, and the visits of individual entertainers. Chute also assisted his mother-in-law in the management of the Bath and Bristol theatres.<br>
<br>On Sarah Macready's death in 1853, Chute, whose own two-part adaptation of <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> was particularly successful at this time, took over the leases of both the Bath and Bristol theatres royal. Both were substantially overhauled during the summer recess: at Bath new decoration and lighting eliminated the &#145;dingy and pass&eacute; appearance&#146; it had borne for many seasons, while an &#145;offensive odour&#146; was dissipated by the renewal of gas pipes  (<span class="italic">Bath and Cheltenham Gazette</span>, 21 Sept 1853); at Bristol the theatre was redecorated, water was laid on, and the stage was considerably enlarged. Chute assembled a forty-strong stock company, and opened both theatres with Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Wife</span> and his own extravaganza, <span class="italic">Mr Chute's Ascent of Parnassus</span>. The company normally played in Bath on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, and at Bristol for the remainder of the week.<br>
<br>Something of Chute's success can be attributed to the quality of his stock company, which Ellen Terry described as &#145;something more than strong&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ellen Terry's Memoirs</span>, 36)&#151;although this could vary&#151;and to his ability to attract and promote the youthful talents of members of his company such as John Coleman, Emily Thorne, Henrietta Hodson, George and William Rignold, Madge Robertson, Ellen and Kate Terry, Marie Wilton, and John Vollaire. His own brother, John Coleman Chute (1819&#150;1913), later lessee of the theatre at Bury St Edmunds, was for a time a member of the company. Chute was a versatile actor and a good singer, and his own most successful roles were as Falstaff, Hawthorn in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>, and the eponymous Fra Diavolo. He was an expert swordsman who enjoyed friendly bouts, especially with Barry Sullivan. A freemason, he was the master of Jerusalem lodge, Bristol, in 1866. He was also a member of the 1st Gloucestershire rifle volunteers, and held the rank of colour-sergeant. William Rignold described Chute as a &#145;fine looking man, deep in chest and broad in the shoulders, well set up, with a twinkling eye that can be severe, broad massive forehead and large moustache. His hands are Frenchy in their action and he is never seen without a pair of gloves.&#146; Those gloves, other members of the company told Rignold, Chute had never been known to put on  (Powell, 113).<br>
<br>Writing of Bath, Belville Penley noted that Chute mounted productions with &#145;considerable attention to detail&#146; and that &#145;the scenery possessed by the theatre was abundant and excellent both in design and execution, while its wardrobe and library ranked among the best in the kingdom&#146;  (Penley, 153). Marie Bancroft regarded him as a &#145;good, kind-hearted severe old manager&#146;  (Bancroft and Bancroft, 14). Increasingly, however, the theatres were visited by touring companies: as early as 1854, these included twenty-seven members of Charles Kean's company from the Princess Theatre, London, and others bringing English and Italian opera and continental ballet.<br>
<br>Chute suffered financially when, on 18 April 1862, fire destroyed the Bath theatre, but he obtained the lease of the new theatre, designed by C. J. Phipps, and opened it on 14 March 1863 with <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> and a farce, <span class="italic">Marriage at Any Price</span>. Prompted no doubt by the superiority of the new Bath theatre, the limited size of its Bristol counterpart, the social changes which had adversely affected the theatre's immediate neighbourhood, and competition from entertainment offered elsewhere in Bristol, Chute decided to build a new Bristol Theatre Royal, at Clifton, employing Phipps as his architect. Costing &pound;18,000 and seating 2154&#151;500 more than the old theatre&#151;it was opened on 14 October 1867 with <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> and J. B. Buckstone's farce <span class="italic">A Rough Diamond</span>. For a time Chute ran both the Bristol theatres and that at Bath, but he relinquished the Bath lease in May 1868 in order to concentrate on his Bristol ventures. The deaths of eighteen people at the new theatre in a crush at the pit and gallery gate on 26 December 1869 clouded his final years, but he continued to run his theatres until his death at 2 Park Row, Bristol, on 23 July 1878, four months after that of his wife. He was survived by nine of his ten children; two of his sons followed him as partners in the management of the Bristol theatres.<br>
