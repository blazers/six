<span class="headword">Barclay,  James</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1763&#150;1774), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and lexicographer</span>, was for many years a curate at All Saints' Church, Edmonton, Middlesex, and a teacher at schools in Goodman's Fields and Tottenham. In 1763 he published <span class="italic">What is Meant by Coming to Christ</span>, the text of a sermon he had delivered in one of the London churches. His fame, however, rests on his <span class="italic">Complete and Universal English Dictionary</span>, first published in 1774; it was to pass through at least twenty-four reprints and editions by 1851. (The editions of 1813, 1841, and 1848 were revised by William Shorton, Henry W. Dewhurst, and Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward, respectively.)<br>
<br>Despite its title the work took account of only a selection of English vocabulary, including &#145;Difficult Words and Technical Terms in all Faculties and Professions&#146;. The stress-point in words was marked, and words were noted which were apparently synonyms: Barclay was the first English lexicographer to attempt the latter. In addition, the reader was provided with information more usually to be found in an encyclopaedia than in a dictionary. Thus, there were articles on politics and society, both past and present (for example, a listing of important historical events, descriptions of major towns and cities in the world, and details of Britain's trading relationships with the rest of the world), and on religion (the denominations of the church) and literature (a listing of Greek, Roman, and English classics). Illustrations accompanied some of the entries. Barclay's interest in linguistic matters <i>per se</i> is evidenced by the inclusion of an article on the origin of language by the Frenchman Abb&eacute; Antoine Anselme (1652&#150;1737), and by a series of articles on the history, grammar, pronunciation, and orthography of English, very probably by Barclay himself. The dictionary won immediate acceptance from the public, especially the lower classes, for whom it acted, until well into the Victorian age, as an important means of self-education.<br>
<br>Barclay's son James, who died on 13 June 1771 at the age of twenty-four, was the youthful author of <span class="italic">An Examination of Mr Kenrick's Review of Mr Johnson's Edition of Shakespeare</span> (1766).<br>
