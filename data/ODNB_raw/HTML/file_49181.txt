<span class="headword">Checkland,  Sydney George</span>  (1916&#150;1986), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 9 October 1916 in Ottawa, Canada, the second of three sons of Sydney Tom Checkland (1878&#150;1958), journalist, and his wife, Fanny Selina Savory Mason (1880&#150;1941), recent immigrants from England. He grew up in a strict nonconformist Baptist home and, after schooling in Ottawa, began work in 1934 as a ledger clerk in the Bank of Nova Scotia. Ambition and night school earned him the associateship of the Canadian Bankers' Association in 1937, by which time he had taken a higher-paid job as accountant with the Ottawa Sanitary Laundry Company. Keeping the laundry afloat was a major challenge, but allowed him to save &pound;250, enough to take him to England in 1938 to study for the BComm at Birmingham University under Philip Sargent Florence. He graduated in 1941 with first-class honours and was active in student affairs, having been president of the Guild of Undergraduates of the University of Birmingham (1940&#150;41). He was also elected president of the National Union of Students in 1941 and president of the International Union of Students the following year. On 11 September 1942 he married (Edith) Olive Anthony [<i>see below</i>], a young geographer he had met at the University of Birmingham.<br>
<br>In 1942 Checkland enlisted and was quickly selected for officer training, attending a six-month crash course at Sandhurst, passing out as the best cadet with the belt of honour. As such he could have chosen any British regiment for a posting, but asked to join a Canadian unit. In the interim he was assigned to the 5th battalion of the Manchester regiment before transferring, as a young lieutenant, to the governor-general's footguards with the Canadian army, now a tank regiment. As a tank commander during the Normandy landings in August 1944 he was severely wounded at Falaise, sustaining nerve damage to his legs which gave him a slight limp.<br>
<br>At the end of the war brief political ambition saw Checkland stand unsuccessfully as a Common Wealth Party candidate for Sheffield Ecclesall in the general election of 1945. Then it was a return to Birmingham to study for an MComm (awarded 1946), followed immediately by his first academic post as assistant lecturer in economic science at Liverpool University. His career progressed swiftly to lecturer (1948) and senior lecturer (1949) before he was attracted to Cambridge in 1953 by Michael Postan to take up a lectureship in economic history. His early publications produced a doctoral thesis at Liverpool and focused on economic thought and science. They attracted much interest and were the foundation for the long perspective on economic change which characterized his writings, and for his transition to economic historian. Four years later, from January 1957, he was in Glasgow, recruited by Hector Hetherington, then principal and vice-chancellor, to take up the new chair and establish a new department of economic history.<br>
<br>It was in Glasgow that Sydney Checkland flourished and built an international reputation of distinction in the broad areas of business, banking, and urban history. As a newcomer to Glasgow he enjoyed the quick friendship and support of Alec Macfie, Alec Cairncross, Donald Robertson, and other newcomers, Alec Nove and Tom Wilson. This distinguished group of economists enjoyed and cultivated an exciting intellectual environment in which they promoted the growth of social sciences in the 1960s. Checkland quickly established links with the local business community to found the Colquhoun lectureship in business history in 1959, the first such post in Britain. From this initiative there grew the Business Archives Council (Scotland) and the beginnings of the unrivalled regional business archive in the University of Glasgow, thus saving for future generations the record of business and commerce of industrial Scotland. This also developed links with HM Register House (the Scottish Records Office) and with the National Register of Archives (Scotland), of which he became chairman in 1971.<br>
<br>Under Checkland's leadership his young department grew rapidly, mirroring his research interests in its development. His first decade in Glasgow also produced his first two books, his highly individualistic text <span class="italic">The Rise of Industrial Society in England, 1815&#150;1885</span> (1964) and a fine business history, <span class="italic">The Mines of Tharsis: Roman, French and British Enterprise in Spain</span> (1967). The next ten years produced a further three books, his biography <span class="italic">The Gladstones: a Family Biography, 1764&#150;1851</span> (1971) receiving the Scottish Arts Council book award. In 1975 his monumental study <span class="italic">Scottish Banking: a History, 1695&#150;1973</span> (1975) won the Saltire Society prize; this was quickly followed by an influential study of Glasgow, <span class="italic">The Upas Tree, Glasgow, 1875&#150;1975, a Study in Growth and Contraction</span> (1976). His scholarly contributions were deservedly recognized in his election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1977, and to the fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1979.<br>
<br>Such active scholarship did not prevent Checkland from taking an active and leading role in his university and in the local community. He served on the university court and other major committees and was influential in establishing, in 1976, the new faculty of social sciences. In the difficult years of urban change in central Scotland, he also served as a board member (1964&#150;8) of the East Kilbride Development Corporation. In the wider academic community he was active in the Social Science Research Council and was chairman of its industry and employment committee from 1982 to 1984. He was also president of the Economic History Society from 1977 to 1980.<br>
<br>While the major part of his career was spent in Glasgow, Checkland travelled widely, twice being a member of the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, and spent periods at Monash University and the Australian National University, and at Queen's University, Kingston, and the University of Alberta. Between 1977 and 1984 he made four extended visits to Japan where he and Olive Checkland developed a strong research interest in the Japanese&#150;Scottish connection. Throughout these years he also maintained a base in Cambridge, returning there on his retirement from Glasgow in 1982. In his final years he produced his major study of British economic and social policy, <span class="italic">British Public Policy, 1776&#150;1939</span> (1983), and jointly with Olive Checkland <span class="italic">Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1882&#150;1914</span> (1984). His final work, <span class="italic">The Elgins: a Tale of Aristocrats and Proconsuls</span> (1988), was brought to publication by Olive Checkland after his death.<br>
<br>Sydney Checkland was one of the most distinguished economic and social historians of his generation, his work pioneering and promoting the disciplines of business, banking, and urban history in Britain. He was the most civilized, generous, and urbane of men, wearing his intellect lightly and with reserve. While he made his career in Scotland and spent his adult life in Britain, he remained Canadian at heart until the end. He captured this in a sensitive autobiography, <span class="italic">Voices across the Water: an Anglo-Canadian Boyhood</span> (1989) also brought to publication by Olive Checkland. He died at Cambridge on 22 March 1986.<br>
<br>Checkland's wife, <a name="cosubject_93872"></a><span class="headword">(Edith) Olive Checkland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Anthony]</span></span>  (1920&#150;2004), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 6 June 1920 at 20 Lyndhurst Avenue, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, the daughter of Robert Fraser Anthony, a process engraver's traveller and former Royal Navy cook, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Philipson, whose father <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71094/', "John Philipson")</script> had been high chief ruler of the temperance society the Independent Order of Rechabites. In search of work her father moved the family to Birmingham, where she was educated in a local school before studying geography at Birmingham University from 1938. By the time of her marriage to Sydney Checkland she was employed as a secondary school teacher. In the last stages of the war she made a significant contribution to her husband's recuperation following the injuries he had suffered during the Normandy landings; the couple also had five children in the period before Sydney was appointed to a chair at Glasgow University in 1957. Olive Checkland played a very active part in the formation of her husband's new department, managing his working day, assisting with his research, and shaping the nature of staff&#150;student relations through such innovations as a Christmas party at which staff were expected to participate in charades and dancing. During the family's twenty-five year residence in Glasgow she also played an important part in helping to salvage and collect the records of Glasgow companies. In 1980 she published her first book, <span class="italic">Philanthropy in Victorian Scotland</span>, which won the Scottish Arts Council book award; this was followed in 1982 by <span class="italic">Health Care and Social History, the Glasgow Case</span> (co-written with Margaret Lamb), and two years later by <span class="italic">Industry and Ethos</span>. In these years the Checklands also undertook research on the exchange of knowledge between Scotland and Japan, and it was on this subject that Olive Checkland specialized after her husband's death. Technical transfer, and the acquisition of manufacturing knowledge, was the subject of her most distinguished work, <span class="italic">Britain's Encounter with Meiji Japan, 1868&#150;1912</span> (1989), and of a later work, <span class="italic">Japanese Whisky, Scotch Blend</span> (1998). Anglo-Japanese relations were also the subject of two further books, <span class="italic">Humanitarianism and the Emperor's Japan, 1877&#150;1977</span> (1993), a study of the Japanese treatment of British prisoners of war, and <span class="italic">Building Cultural Bridges</span> (2003). On four occasions she was a visiting professor at Keio University, Tokyo, and her work on Anglo-Japanese relations was recognized by the Japan Society in 2001. She also acted as an associate editor for nineteenth-century east Asian subjects for the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>, to which she contributed five biographies, including that of her maternal grandfather, John Philipson. After leaving Glasgow she lived in Cambridge. She died of heart failure on 8 September 2004 at Swansea, while staying with one of her daughters. She was survived by her five children.<br>
