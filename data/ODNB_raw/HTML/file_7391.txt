<span class="headword">Deane, Sir  Thomas Newenham</span>  (1828&#150;1899), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Dundanion, near Cork, on 15 June 1828. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7390/', "Sir Thomas Deane (1792&#150;1871)")</script>, architect, and his second wife, Elizabeth O'Callaghan (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of Robert O'Callaghan Newenham and granddaughter of Sir Edward Newenham, politician. Deane was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating BA in 1849. He received his early professional training from his father, whose firm he joined in 1850, and was thus concerned in the important buildings carried out at Oxford and elsewhere between 1850 and 1860, largely designed by his father's other partner, Benjamin Woodward. On 29 January 1850 he married Henrietta, daughter of Joseph H. Manly of Ferney, co. Cork; they had several children. On the death of his father in 1871 Deane became the sole member of the firm, Woodward having died in 1861. His work in the 1860s and 1870s included St Mary's Church of Ireland Cathedral at Tuam, co. Galway (1861&#150;78), the restoration of St Canice's Church of Ireland Cathedral, Kilkenny (1864&#150;70), and a number of important additions to Dublin architecture, of which St Ann's Church in Dawson Street (1867) and the Munster and Leinster Bank in Dame Street (1872&#150;4) are perhaps the chief. He also designed the Clarendon Laboratory (1869) and the Meadow Buildings at Christ Church, Oxford (1862&#150;4). In a number of these works he continued the earlier firm's allegiance to the Venetian style. In 1878 he was joined in his practice by his eldest son, Thomas Manly Deane (1850&#150;1933), with whom he remained in partnership until his death. Together with his son he was responsible for such notable buildings as the town hall at Bray, co. Wicklow (1882), and the McArthur Hall at Methodist College, Belfast (1887&#150;91), but unquestionably the work for which Deane will be best remembered is the Science and Art Museum (known as the National Museum) and National Library of Ireland in Dublin. The result of a public competition, it was begun in 1885, the foundation stone being laid by the prince of Wales (afterwards Edward VII), and it was completed in 1890. At the opening Deane was knighted by the lord lieutenant of Ireland, the earl of Zetland. This work was followed by important additions to the Natural History Museum and the National Gallery of Ireland, and by the building of the Royal Dublin Society's lecture theatre, all of these forming part of the group of buildings of which the eighteenth-century Leinster House (now the seat of the Irish parliament) is the centre. The sustained repute of the firm was shown by its winning second place in the competition for the Imperial Institute at South Kensington, London, and by the submission of its name by the Royal Institute of British Architects to the commissioners of works for selection for the new government buildings in Whitehall and Parliament Street, London.<br>
<br>Deane was keenly interested in the movement for the preservation of the ancient monuments of Ireland, and was appointed to the post of inspector of national and ancient monuments following the <span class="roman">Ancient Monuments Protection Acts</span> of 1882 and 1892. He was also a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. Deane was described by a contemporary as a man of a light and elastic temperament and social disposition, and enjoyed a wide popularity in Dublin. He died suddenly at 37 Stephen's Green, Dublin, on 8 November 1899. After his death his practice was continued by his eldest son, Thomas Manly Deane.<br>
<br>Thomas Manly Deane was born in 1850 at Ferney, co. Cork. He was a pupil of William Burges ARA (1827&#150;1881), of London, and also studied at the Slade School, London, and later in France and Italy. He gained the Royal Academy travelling scholarship in 1876. After his father's death he was joint architect, with Sir Aston Webb RA (1849&#150;1930) of London, for the College of Science and government offices in Dublin (1903&#150;11), and on their opening in 1911 he was knighted by George V. He was a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy but did not join any architectural institutes or societies. Affected by failing eyesight he retired to Wales where he died in 1933.<br>
