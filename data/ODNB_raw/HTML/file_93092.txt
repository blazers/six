<span class="headword">Smith,  Alan Verner <span class="st"> [Sam]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1983), <span class="occ">toymaker and sculptor</span>, was born on 27 July 1908 at 118 Hill Lane, Shirley, Southampton, the son of Edwin Thomas Smith, a steamship captain, and Alice Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward; he had two siblings, Ivor and Rita. Between 1918 and 1925 Smith was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, and subsequently at Bournemouth School of Art (1926&#150;8) and Westminster School of Art, London (1928&#150;30). On 6 July 1931 he married Edith Ailsa MacGregor (<i>b</i>. 1901/2), artist, and daughter of Donald MacGregor; the couple had a son, Nicolas. Smith's first ambition was to become a painter and in 1925 one of his pictures was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. However, his career did not take off and in 1933 he found employment with Muriel Rose as an assistant at her Little Gallery in Ellis Street, London.<br>
<br>Impressed by an exhibition of European toys, Smith began making small wooden objects and later wooden toys to sell in the gallery. This early work comprised extremely simple human figures, boats, and animals including lions with manes of wood shavings and tails of rough string. In this period he also designed greetings cards, cartoons, postcards, advertisements, illustrated books, and a catalogue for the Piccadilly retailers, Fortnum and Mason. From 1935 Smith's work was exhibited at the Little Gallery and he began to gain critical recognition. Looking back, he saw this as the time in which he shed any lingering desire to be an artist and &#145;became an ordinary person, making things about ordinary people&#146; (quoted in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 February 1983).<br>
<br>During the Second World War Smith worked for the Redbridge Bailey Bridge Company at Christchurch, Hampshire, where he drew bridges for the company's engineers, and edited the works' magazine. The technical skills learned here would be used in his working drawings throughout the rest of his career. After the war Smith recognized that there was a shortage of toys and set up a small factory in the garage of his home at Lilliput, near Poole. His simple toys proved very successful and were bought by Fortnum and Mason. In 1948 he moved to Kingswear, Devon, with Gladys Muriel Jewett (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), an artist and stage designer. A meeting with an American businessman, Henry Rothschild, led to &#145;Sea Breezes&#146;, the first of several exhibitions of Smith's work at Rothschild's craft shop, Primavera, in Sloane Street, London. Smith's closeness to the sea during childhood deeply influenced his work, and he retained a fascination with boats throughout his working life. He was also enthralled by the bustle and noise of a lively seaside port. Other formative influences included his memories of ornate theatrical props and the gaudy spectacle of the fairground, as well as an appreciation of the vibrant colours and often na&iuml;ve quality of popular or &#145;folk art&#146;.<br>
<br>By the late 1940s Smith's work was becoming more abstract and often larger and more sculptural. He continued to make toy boats, but rather than produce replicas he imbued them with human characteristics such as pride, vanity, and patriotism by which they became vehicles to comment on the complexities of adult life. Many of Smith's sculptures&#151;often involving working parts&#151;were also more suggestive than his pre-war models. Figurines of pouchy army officers balancing young women on knees or shoulders offer further examples of Smith's use of sculpture as social and political commentary. In his own words: &#145;children's toys are mainly about pretending to be grown up. The things I make are about what it's like when you get there&#146; (quoted in information leaflet, &#145;Toys Grow Up&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1955 Smith gave his support at the foundation of the British Toymakers' Guild, formed to foster good quality handmade toys in the face of the mass production that dominated the post-war market. By this time Smith was gaining a dedicated following in the United States where, in the mid-1960s, he exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York, Design Research (New York and Cambridge, Massachusetts), and the Chair House in San Francisco. British shows included a series of exhibitions at London's Portal Gallery (from 1961) and the Arnolfini in Bristol. However, it was not until a major retrospective in 1972 at the Bristol City Art Gallery (and later at the Camden Arts Centre, London, and the Beaford Arts Centre, Devon) that Smith gained the recognition in Britain that had been accorded to him in the United States. Four years later his work featured in a highly regarded <span class="italic">Arena</span> documentary for the BBC and the Arts Council. The programme's title, <span class="italic">Sam Smith: Genuine England</span>, used the signature adopted by the artist after his toys went on sale in the 1930s. Both words are seen by reviewers as highly appropriate descriptions of a body of work which, in its attachment to the &#145;ordinary&#146;, sought to expose pomposity and artifice while playing to an English tradition of nonsense humour, caricature, Victorian carnival, and the seaside. Indeed, in an interview from the 1970s, Smith described himself less as an artist or craftsman and more &#145;as a kind of entertainer&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 August 1974), and work in this period also included two illustrated story books, <span class="italic">The Crew Cats</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Rover's Regatta Day</span> (1977). Exhibitions throughout the 1970s in Britain, Europe, and North America culminated in a second retrospective at London's Serpentine Gallery between December 1980 and February 1981. From 1975 Smith and Gladys Jewett had lived at Newton Abbot, Devon, and the couple married on 18 September 1978; there were no children from the relationship. After a long illness, the onset of which coincided with the Serpentine exhibition, Sam Smith died on 9 February 1983 at College Road, Newton Abbot; his body was cremated and his ashes scattered on the bank of the River Dart. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Following his death, Smith's work has been shown at the Plymouth Arts Centre (1986), Southampton City Art Gallery (2001), the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath (2003), and Pollock's Toy Museum, London, in an exhibition entitled &#145;Toys Grow Up&#146; (2003). Examples of his work may be found in the collections of, among others, the Bristol, Manchester, and Southampton city art galleries, the Crafts Council, Arts Council of Great Britain, the Welsh Arts Council, and the Museum of Childhood which owns one of the artist's largest pieces, <span class="italic">Tmith</span> (1973), a wooden sculpture, part lion, part woman with six detachable figures.<br>
