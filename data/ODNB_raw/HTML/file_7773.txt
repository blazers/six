<span class="headword">Dolben,  David</span>  (1581&#150;1633), <span class="occ">bishop of Bangor</span>, was born at Segrwyd, Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch, Denbighshire, a younger son of Robert Wyn Dolben of Segrwyd, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Owen ap Reinallt of Glyn Llugwy, in Llanrwst. His family, settled at Segrwyd since 1497, when it had been given to his great-great-grandfather Robert Dolben for his support for Henry VII against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath, had supplied a recorder and several common councillors to the nearby town of Denbigh during the sixteenth century. Dolben was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1602, and proceeded MA in 1609. He was ordained deacon on 23 September 1610 and priest on 23 December 1610, both at Fulham, and became curate of Baythorpe, Hertfordshire. He was appointed vicar of Hackney in Middlesex in January 1619. He held the living of Hackney until May 1633, but in 1621 acquired in addition the living of Llangernyw, Denbighshire, in the gift of the bishop of St Asaph. In 1626 he was promoted to the prebendary of St Asaph. This in turn led to recognition in the town of Denbigh, which made him capital burgess in 1627, in which year he was also made doctor of divinity. However, other than some undergraduate verses, Dolben published nothing, and played no significant part in the controversies in church affairs which marked the 1620s and 1630s.<br>
<br>The death of Lewis Bayly in 1631 provided Dolben, as a leading north Wales cleric, with an opening, and he succeeded Bayly as bishop of Bangor. He was elected on 18 November 1631, and was consecrated at Lambeth by Archbishop George Abbot on 4 March 1632. He may have owed some of his preferment to Sir Julius Caesar, master of the rolls, whose family held property in Hackney and in Beaumaris, and to whom Dolben acknowledged his gratitude for past favours. By June 1632 Dolben declared himself to be ill and a year later he was noted as &#145;crazy and very sickly&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1633&#150;4</i>, 110), the object of manoeuvrings for his bishopric.<br>
<br>Dolben died, unmarried, on 27 November 1633 at Bangor House, Shoe Lane, in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn. Despite a wish expressed in his will to be buried in Bangor, he was buried in Hackney parish church, where he had been vicar for fourteen years. A half-length effigy of him, in ruff and lawn sleeves, complemented by an inscription and commendatory verses, was erected, and re-erected when the church was rebuilt. In his will he left &pound;30 for lands to be bought to relieve poor families in Hackney, and for improvements to the local roads. He bestowed money also on the poor of Bangor, Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch, and Denbigh. St John's College, Cambridge, was left &pound;20 for its library, and Jesus College, Oxford, received 20 marks for the same purpose. As he wished, his successor as bishop of Bangor was Edward Griffith, the dean.<br>
