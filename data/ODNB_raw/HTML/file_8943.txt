<span class="headword">Evans,  Brooke</span>  (1797&#150;1862), <span class="occ">nickel refiner</span>, was born in Bull Street, Birmingham, the son of a woollen draper and tailor. He went to school in Singer's Hill, Birmingham, and Aldridge, Staffordshire. On leaving school at the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to a gun maker, and made his first acquaintance with metallurgy.<br>
<br>Having served his apprenticeship, Evans travelled to the United States, and entered into partnership with a gun maker in New York. He was only partially successful in this trade, and he returned to England in 1826. He then went off prospecting in Central America, where he became an indigo planter and merchant in Guatemala. In the course of a voyage home, the captain of his ship and several of the crew were seized with yellow fever in the Gulf of Mexico. Evans apparently took command of the ship, and navigated her successfully to the British Isles. He afterwards purchased a small business in the glass and lead trade at Stratford upon Avon, where he lived six years with his sister. This business prospered, and enabled him to save up to &pound;6000.<br>
<br>Charles Askin, a veterinary surgeon who was greatly interested in chemistry and metals, was a friend of Evans. While staying in Warsaw, Askin had discovered that a white metal called argentan contained nickel and he and Evans experimented with methods of refining nickel from speiss (an impure mixture of cobalt, nickel, and other metals), left after the preparation of cobalt blue for painting pottery. They were successful, and Askin went into partnership with Messrs H. and T. Merry to manufacture German silver, an alloy of nickel, copper, and zinc. Askin gained &pound;1500 from the venture, and subsequently went into partnership with Evans. In 1835 they built works in Birmingham, where they successfully produced refined nickel from nickel-speiss. The demand for Evans and Askin's refined nickel and German silver increased rapidly, because it was durable, attractive, and able to be stamped, spun, cast, and wrought.<br>
<br>The speiss produced by the cobalt blue manufacturers was quite insufficient for their requirements, however, and Evans explored Europe for new sources of ores containing nickel. He heard of its existence at the mines of Dobschan in Hungary, visited the place, and bought all the ore for which he could afford to pay, although this new ore contained half as much cobalt as nickel. As cobalt was detrimental to the German silver, and as Askin could not by his mode of refining separate these metals, new techniques had to be developed. The demand for nickel was meanwhile steadily increasing, especially from the Birmingham electroplating business of Elkingtons; and by steady perseverance Evans and Askin discovered a process by which they obtained refined nickel in large quantities. To meet the demand Askin visited some nickel mines near Geisdal in Norway in 1847, where he died suddenly on 25 August. He was taken home and buried at Edgbaston. The nickel business was continued by Evans, who died at Edgbaston on 15 September 1862 and was buried near his partner. The firm of Evans and Askin was taken over by Henry Wiggin, who had joined the business in 1842 and had become a partner six years later.<br>
