<span class="headword">Rumbold,  Richard William John Nugent</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Richard Lumford]</span>  (1913&#150;1961), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 24 June 1913, probably at Dowth Hall, co. Meath, Ireland, second of the three children of Charles Edmund Arden Law Rumbold (1872&#150;1943), sometime captain 2nd dragoon guards, and Anne Christian (1881&#150;1928), daughter of the Hon. Richard Anthony Nugent and his wife, Henrietta Gradwell. An elder brother died at birth and he had a sister, Rosemary, three years younger. His mother was from an ancient Norman-Irish family, the earls of Westmeath. His father was English, wealthy, descended from the famous nabob Sir Thomas Rumbold, governor of Madras; also from the Ardens, relatives of Shakespeare. Rumbold's autobiographical book <span class="italic">My Father's Son</span> (1947), with fictional names and under the pseudonym Richard Lumford, was a brave and cathartic account of his wretched childhood, and revealed him as a gifted writer dominated by a bullying father. This work also included an account of the suicide of his mother. It was reissued in 1958 under his own name, with an introduction by Harold Nicolson, his long-suffering mentor and constant support. His second cousin William Plomer was to confirm that the description of the father was no exaggeration: &#145;only a Balzac or a Dickens could dream up such a character&#146;. Rumbold was handsome and physically well built, with blue eyes. His father attacked him constantly for &#145;effeminancy&#146;, and regarded intellectuals as &#145;half-baked&#146;. Just as the father was constantly on the move from house to house, so Rumbold was sent to a number of schools, in England, France, and Germany. For a while, to &#145;knock out the softness&#146;, he was a cadet on a naval training ship, an unhappy experience. However, he passed into Christ Church, Oxford, where he revived and ran a literary club, arranging talks by such personalities as Lord Alfred Douglas, Frieda Lawrence, W. B. Yeats, and Charles Morgan; many of these speakers became loyal friends. Rumbold had been brought up a Roman Catholic, but by this time he was becoming disillusioned with Catholic dogma. In 1933 he published a novel, <span class="italic">Little Victims</span>, which he dedicated to Richard Aldington. This bitter, ill-judged, obviously autobiographical book was a <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i>, lashing out at the church, his parents, public-school homosexuality, and Oxford aesthetes. He was refused the sacrament by the university chaplain, Ronald Knox. Furious, he decided to abjure Roman Catholicism. Very soon afterwards he spat blood and tuberculosis was diagnosed. He left Oxford without taking a degree in 1934.<br>
<br>Rumbold travelled a great deal and on a cruise met a well-off American, Hilda Byrne Young, who for much of his life acted as a doting substitute mother, amazingly tolerant of his homosexuality and sometimes treated as a servant. On Harold Nicolson's suggestion that he should interest himself in other people's problems, he visited the London docklands and Welsh coalmines, and became genuinely obsessed with a desire to help the underdog. When war came he joined up as a private in the Royal Army Service Corps, but soon transferred to the Royal Air Force. He was exhilarated by the experience of his training as a pilot, not only the flying but the sense of comradeship. His lyrical descriptions are outstanding in <span class="italic">My Father's Son</span>. Later, bombing raids upset his conscience, and he applied to become a fighter pilot. Some foolhardy escapades ended with flying under the Menai Bridge, for which he was court-martialled. Once more he spat blood.<br>
<br>Desperate for literary recognition, brooding over imagined slights, deeply serious, longing for the true love he could never achieve, Rumbold first began treatment for schizophrenia in Switzerland and then began visits to a psychiatrist, Denis Carroll, who encouraged him to write his autobiography. He wrote articles, and edited a somewhat skimpy collection of Flaubert's letters in 1950. He took up riding a motorcycle, at tremendous speeds. His ecstatic discovery of flying led to a biography of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, <span class="italic">The Winged Life</span> (1953), written in collaboration with Lady Margaret Stewart. Hilda Young accompanied him to Ceylon, where he hoped to find &#145;sensual liberation and spiritual reconciliation&#146;. His interest in Buddhism took him to Japan, where he was a part-time postulant in a Zen monastery. Back in England, after an operation, his obvious inner turmoil increased, to the concern of many devoted friends, partly as a result of a further disaster in his family, the death of his sister. Rumbold went to Sicily, accompanied by Hilda Young, and by Archibald Colquhoun, the translator of <span class="italic">The Leopard</span>, who himself had recently returned to the Roman Catholic faith. Rumbold still regarded the church as the enemy of freedom and pleasure, especially for its stance on homosexuality, but reluctantly agreed to attend mass daily; Harold Nicolson maintained that he was refused confession and communion, the priests presumably having been told by Colquhoun of the original interdict. All the time he was desperately working on two books.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1961, at a hotel in Palermo, while Hilda Young was typing in another room, Rumbold fell from a window, possibly accidentally, and was killed. He was permitted a Roman Catholic funeral in the graveyard of the Anglican church of Watton-on-Stone in Hertfordshire, the village where his ancestor Sir Thomas Rumbold had built his splendid house. One recalls Rumbold's own description of Saint-Exup&eacute;ry: &#145;He remained to the end an idealist, an anguished idealist, ceaselessly searching for a faith for his idealism, and for inner peace&#146;. Extracts from his diaries, with some meditations on Zen, were movingly&#151;and to some extent discreetly&#151;edited by William Plomer in <span class="italic">A Message in Code</span> (1964).<br>
