<span class="headword">Hesketh <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cowper]</span>,  Harriet</span>, Lady Hesketh  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1807), <span class="occ">cousin and intimate friend of the poet William Cowper</span>, was baptized in St Mary's, Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire, on 12 July 1733, the eldest of three daughters of Ashley Cowper (1701&#150;1788), clerk of the parliaments, and Dorothy, daughter of the Revd John Oakes of Bluntisham, Huntingdonshire. Her paternal uncle, the Revd John Cowper, had married Anne Donne, a descendant of the poet John Donne. <br>
<br>As a child Harriet lived at Southampton Row, between Bloomsbury and Holborn, where the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6513/', "William Cowper")</script>, her cousin and two years her senior, was a frequent visitor. Her sister, Theodora Jane, entered into an unhappy love affair with Cowper. Explicit evidence in letters passing between Harriet and Cowper refutes any possibility that a romantic attachment existed between them also. Accounted a beauty in her youth, she became engaged to Thomas Hesketh (1726/7&#150;1778) of Rufford Hall, near Ormskirk, Lancashire, about 1754; they were later married in Oxford Chapel, Cavendish Square, London. Early in their relationship the couple accompanied Cowper on a visit to Southampton, where the poet spent several months recuperating from an early bout of the chronic mental illness which dogged his adult life. On 5 May 1761 Thomas Hesketh was created baronet. <br>
<br>An estrangement between Harriet Hesketh and her cousin, lasting nineteen years, commenced in March 1766. Cowper's letters indicate that the breach was initiated by Hesketh. During this interval the poet sought retirement in Olney, Buckinghamshire, and Hesketh accompanied her husband for periods abroad from 1769. Sir Thomas died on 4 March 1778, aged fifty-one, after an illness lasting three years, leaving his wife in comfortable circumstances with &pound;800 a year. Hesketh resumed contact with Cowper early in October 1785, when she wrote to congratulate him on publication of the second volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span>, and in June 1786 she visited the poet at his home in Olney. Her cheerful, generous nature helped alleviate Cowper's depression and she provided the financial means to enable him to quit his gloomy dwelling for Weston Park, a vacant house on the edge of the village, in October. She took up residence at Weston Park herself during Cowper's final mental collapse in 1793, but was unable to prevail upon Mrs Mary Unwin, who cohabited with Cowper, that he should be placed at Gretford, near Stamford, in the care of the celebrated Dr Francis Willis, the physician credited with curing the madness of George III. After Hesketh's offer to pay for Cowper's treatment was refused she nursed Cowper, to the detriment of her own health, for a period of two years. Following the poet's death in 1800 she supplied his friend William Hayley (1745&#150;1820) with most of the materials for his biography, <span class="italic">The Life, and Posthumous Writings of William Cowper, Esq.</span>, published in 1803. <br>
<br>Between April 1780 and July 1796 Hesketh was living in New Norfolk Street, Grosvenor Square. She suffered ill health in her last years and divided her time between Bath, Clifton, and Weymouth. A period of convalescence at Weymouth between August and October 1804 coincided with a visit by the royal family, amid widespread fears of a French invasion. These events form the subject of several candid letters to a female friend, Mrs Ricketts, composed at the end of August, which reveal Hesketh's redoubtable personality in advancing years, and her strongly held opinions. She was an ardent tory whose idolatrous loyalty to her sovereign, whom she called &#145;the king of kings&#146;, was matched only by her unbridled revulsion for the prince of Wales, whom she censured as &#145;a Drunken brat&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 30007, fols. 55<i>v</i>&#150;60<i>v</i>). <br>
<br>Fanny Burney, an acquaintance of Hesketh, described her as &#145;well-informed, well-bred, sensible &hellip; somewhat too precise and stiff, but otherwise agreeable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay</span>, 1.445). In a letter to Hayley dated 28 January 1802, Hesketh admitted that she knew herself to be troublesome and impertinent but having &#145;acquir'd a <i>decided</i> Character&#146; she felt she had no alternative but to live up to it. Her conduct throughout her life and her surviving correspondence would seem to bear out her own estimate of her qualities as a friend. In a letter to Mrs Ricketts she confided: &#145;I have often thought that I posses[s]'d one sentiment in common with Deane Swift&#151;who says somewhere that &#147;he hates the world in general, but loves Tom-Dick-&amp;Harry&#148;. This is very much my case&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 30007, fol. 57<i>r</i>). She died, childless in Clifton, on 15 January 1807, and was buried in Bristol Cathedral.<br>
