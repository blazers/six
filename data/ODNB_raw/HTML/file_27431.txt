<span class="headword">Tickell,  Richard</span>  (1751&#150;1793), <span class="occ">playwright and satirist</span>, was a grandson of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27432/', "Thomas Tickell (1685&#150;1740)")</script>, Addison's friend, and the second son of the three sons and two daughters of John Tickell (1729&#150;1782) and his wife, Esther, daughter of Thomas Pierson. John Tickell was born at Dublin Castle, and was given the lease of house and demesne lands of Glasnevin by his mother on 24 October 1754. He held these until 1765, and during this time he was six clerk in chancery and a magistrate in Dublin, until he moved his family to New Windsor, Berkshire, as a result of the disturbances in Dublin. Richard is said to have been born at Bath, where he later built Beaulieu House, Newbridge Hill. In Samuel Parr's <span class="italic">Works</span> (8.129) the editor, John Johnstone, states that Tickell was &#145;acquainted with Parr at Harrow&#146;, but there is no other record of this. Also unsubstantiated is Horace Walpole's assertion that Tickell had been an assistant at Eton College: his name has not been found in the archives of that school. A twentieth-century genealogical researcher, however, maintains that Tickell entered Winchester College on 19 June 1764 and Eton College on 29 May 1765  (Tickell, 62). Whatever the conflicting reports of his early education, it is certain that he was entered at the Middle Temple on 8 November 1768. He has been confused with William Tickell, a surgeon and chemist of Bath, who invented the Aethereal Anodyne Spirit elixir.<br>
<br>After being called to the bar, Tickell was appointed one of the sixty commissioners of bankruptcy who were divided into twelve &#145;lists&#146; of five, Tickell being in the third. Owing, as he contended, to an unjust complaint of the other gentlemen of his list, he was deprived of his place in 1778; but David Garrick, whose acquaintance he had made, successfully interceded for him with Lord Chancellor Bathurst. He told Garrick at the time that he was &#145;wholly dependent on his grandmother's assistance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.305). His friend William Brummell, private secretary to Lord North, thereupon obtained for him a pension of &pound;200 for writing in support of the ministry, and the further reward of a commissionership in the stamp office, his appointment being dated 24 August 1781, and his salary &pound;500 a year.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1778 a musical entertainment by Tickell, called <span class="italic">The Camp</span>, was represented at Drury Lane &#145;with great success&#146; according to Genest  (4.75). Three weeks later Tickell declined to write a prologue for Garrick on the ground that he was employed in a work that would make or mar his fortune  (<span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 2.317). This may have been the satirical <span class="italic">Anticipation: containing the substance of his Majesty's most gracious speech to both h-s of p-t on the opening of the approaching session</span> of which the preface is dated 23 November 1778. It attracted general attention. Tickell was worried about its reception until he learned that the house had roared with laughter when Isaac Barr&eacute;, who had not seen the pamphlet, used words and phrases which were attributed to him in it. Nothing, however, in the imaginary speech closely resembles the one which, according to <span class="italic">The Parliamentary History of England</span> (1814), was spoken by Barr&eacute;. Gibbon, writing to Holroyd on Tuesday night (24 November 1778), expressed the view that: &#145;In town we think it an excellent piece of humour &hellip; but serious patriots groan that such things should be turned to farce.&#146; The prince of Wales, as reported by Croker, praised Tickell's talents very highly. A second pamphlet (also anonymous), with the same title, of far inferior interest, probably by another hand, appeared five days before the meeting of parliament in 1779. <span class="italic">Anticipation</span> was reprinted in New York in 1942, edited by L. H. Butterfield, with a biographical introduction, notes, and a bibliography.<br>
<br>On 25 July 1780 Tickell married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16734/', "Mary Linley (1758&#150;1787)")</script>, a vocalist [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16737/', "Linley, Thomas (1733&#150;1795)")</script>]. Her elder sister, Elizabeth Ann, was married to Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Tickell is said, however, already to have had a family with a mistress, Miss B., with whom he had lived  (Baker, 1.714). After his marriage he had a grant of rooms in Hampton Court Palace. His opera in three acts, called <span class="italic">The Carnival of Venice</span>, was successfully produced at Drury Lane on 13 December 1781, Linley's music and some of the songs by his wife's sister contributing to the favourable impression. An adaptation of <span class="italic">The Gentle Shepherd</span>, performed on 27 May 1789, was the last of Tickell's theatrical works.<br>
<br>Intimacy with his brother-in-law, Sheridan, led to Tickell's transferring his party pen to the support of Charles James Fox. After several rejections he was elected a member of Brooks's Club in 1785. Tickell was zealously engaged at the time in influencing public opinion, and wrote to Parr for &#145;a list of the inns in Warwickshire where farmers resort to, and of such coffee-houses or hotels as are in your county&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Samuel Parr</span>, 8.130). He was active with his pen in denouncing the commercial treaty made with France in 1787, and he told Parr that he had written the <span class="italic">Woollen-Draper's Letter on the French Treaty</span> and answered the <span class="italic">Political Review</span>, &#145;I mean the pamphlet which traduced the Prince of Wales and every one else except Hastings&#146;  (ibid., 131). He was also a contributor to the <span class="italic">Rolliad</span>. Sheridan's sister Elizabeth, writing on 20 December 1788 from her brother's house in Bruton Street, says, &#145;Yesterday &hellip; Tickell and Joseph Richardson were here all day preparing an address to come from different parts of the country to counteract Mr. Pitt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Betsy Sheridan's Journal</span>, ed. W. Lefanu, 1986, 136).<br>
<br>Thomas James Mathias in the <span class="italic">Pursuits of Literature</span> paid Tickell the compliment of styling him &#145;the happiest of any occasional writer in his day&#146;. According to Adair, he had in private conversation a good deal of wit and was an admirable mimic. Some of his other plays and his pamphlets include: <span class="italic">The Wreath of Fashion</span> (1778); <span class="italic">The Green Box of Monsieur de Sartine</span>, an adaptation from the French (1779); and <span class="italic">Epistle from Charles Fox to John Townshend</span> (1779).<br>
<br>Tickell was experiencing some financial difficulties in 1793; he had borrowed &pound;1000 from Thomas Hammersley of Pall Mall by a bond dated 8 January 1793, with a promise to pay &pound;500 within two years. The bond was called in suddenly, however, and he is recorded as having asked for a loan of &pound;500 from Warren Hastings. On 19 May he wrote again, professing respect and gratitude for Hastings's &#145;spirited and noble manner in acceding to my request&#146;  (<span class="italic">Warren Hastings MSS</span>, BM). On 4 November 1793, however, Tickell committed suicide. In a fit of depression, he jumped from the parapet outside the window of his rooms at Hampton Court, but owing to the efforts of Sheridan, the inquest's verdict was that of accidental death. Sheridan also took the children of Tickell's first marriage into his care, obtaining admission into the navy for Richard (1782&#150;1805), and a writership in India for Samuel (1785&#150;1817). R. E. Tickell maintains that the third child of this marriage was a daughter, Elizabeth Anne (1781&#150;1860), who was unmarried when she died at her Bedford Square London home. It is certain, however, that Tickell had another daughter, Zipporah, who later married Ebenezer Roebuck, an employee of the East India Company, and became the mother of John Arthur Roebuck (1802&#150;1879).<br>
<br>Tickell's second wife, whom he had married in 1789, was Sarah, daughter of Captain Ley of the East Indiaman <i>Berrington</i>. A beautiful girl of eighteen at the time of her marriage, she survived her husband, but her behaviour after his death gained her the censure of Tickell's contemporaries, as she was said to have had a small dowry and expensive tastes, and to have kept a coach and four while her husband's debts remained unpaid. In 1796 she remarried; her new husband was John Cotton Worthington, a major in the Sussex fencible cavalry.<br>
