<span class="headword">Townsend,  Isaac</span>  (1684/5&#150;1765), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the nephew of Sir Isaac Townsend (<i>d</i>. 1731), captain in the navy, and for many years resident commissioner at Portsmouth. He may have entered the navy in 1696, as servant to his uncle, captain of the <i>Ipswich</i>. He was warranted as a volunteer on that ship in December of this year. Afterwards he was in the <i>Severn</i>, <i>Lincoln</i>, <i>Royal William</i>, <i>Russell</i>, and again the <i>Ipswich</i> as a seaman or midshipman. Townsend passed his lieutenant's examination on 15 January 1706. It is possible that he was both at Vigo in 1702 and in the action off Malaga in August 1704. He received his first commission, as third lieutenant of the <i>Resolution</i>, on 29 July 1707. On 24 September 1707 he was appointed lieutenant of the <i>Hastings</i> with Captain John Paul, employed on the Irish station, apparently until the peace. Townsend became second lieutenant of the <i>Dorsetshire</i> on 3 March 1718. On 30 June 1719 he was appointed commander of the fireship <i>Poole</i>, and on 9 February 1720 he achieved post rank as captain of the <i>Success</i> (20 guns), which he commanded on the Irish station for the next ten years. In February 1734 he was given command of the newly commissioned <i>Plymouth</i> on the home station. In mid-1738 Townsend was ordered to join Nicholas Haddock's squadron in the Mediterranean. In June 1739 Haddock appointed Townsend to the <i>Berwick</i>. In March 1740 Townsend was sent home with a convoy. Along with his ship's company, he was then turned over to the <i>Shrewsbury</i> in April 1740, one of the fleet in the channel, with Sir John Norris, and for some time the flagship of Sir Chaloner Ogle, with whom, at the end of the year, she went out to the West Indies. In the operations against Cartagena in March&#150;April 1741 the <i>Shrewsbury</i>, with the <i>Norfolk</i> and <i>Russell</i>, all 80-gun ships, captured the small forts of St Iago and St Philip, at the entrance to the outer harbour. The <i>Shrewsbury</i> suffered heavy damage with over 60 dead and wounded. After the failure of the operation against Cartagena the <i>Shrewsbury</i> returned to England with a number of other ships under Commodore Richard Lestock.<br>
<br>On 19 June 1744 Townsend was promoted rear-admiral of the red and in December he was elected MP for Portsmouth in the Admiralty interest. On 23 April 1745 he advanced to vice-admiral of the blue. Early that year he went out to the Mediterranean as third in command, with his flag in the <i>Dorsetshire</i>. Shortly afterwards news arrived of the departure of a French squadron for the Americas and Townsend was detached with eight ships of the line to protect the British West Indian islands. He had further instructions to try to capture St Lucia or Puerto Rico. In the event the French were not threatening the British islands and the capture of enemy islands proved impracticable. However, Townsend intercepted a convoy of French merchant ships off Martinique on 31 October 1745, capturing or destroying over thirty of the vessels.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1745 rumours reached London of French preparations to retake Louisbourg, which had been captured by a force of New Englanders, supported by Commodore Peter Warren, in August 1745. Townsend was ordered to take over command of Louisbourg from Warren, who was anxious to return to England. Townsend sailed from Antigua on 31 January 1746 and arrived on 9 May. He remained at Louisbourg with the squadron while the French squadron approached, but failed to attack, the town.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1747 Townsend was promoted admiral of the blue and in 1754 he became governor of Greenwich Hospital. In this position he had to undertake the custody of Admiral John Byng after his arrest in July 1756. He is said by Byng's friends to have performed this duty with needless, even brutal, severity. It is impossible to be certain of Townsend's attitude to Byng, but he had no reservations about succeeding to Byng's parliamentary seat at Rochester after the latter's execution in March 1757.<br>
<br>In February 1757 Townsend was promoted admiral of the white, and following the death of Lord Anson in 1762 he became the senior admiral on the list. He married Elizabeth (1699/1700&#150;1754), daughter of William Larcum, a surgeon of Richmond, and half-sister (on the mother's side) of Elizabeth, daughter of Anthony Storey, apothecary of London, and wife of Sir Isaac Townsend, Townsend's uncle. The fact that uncle and nephew shared the same name has caused frequent confusion, which this curious marriage with sisters of the same Christian name easily intensifies. Townsend has also been confused with George Townsend (1715&#150;1769), a contemporary in rank, though a younger man. Townsend's wife died on 1 April 1754. His only son, Charles, died on 13 January 1764. Townsend himself died on 21 November 1765, aged eighty, and he was buried the next day with his wife and son in the chancel of St Mary, Thorpe, Surrey. A daughter, Elizabeth, survived him.<br>
