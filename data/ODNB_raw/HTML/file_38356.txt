<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Terry,  Edward O'Connor</span>  (1844&#150;1912), <span class="occ">actor and theatre proprietor</span>, was born on 10 March 1844 at 42 Gibson Street, Lambeth, London, the son of John Terry, a painter and actor, and his wife, Emblen Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Middleton. Terry was already an experienced amateur actor when he swiftly quit a commercial career to appear professionally, on a &#145;stage&#146; made from 9 inch planks laid upon trestles, at the Mechanics' Institute, Christchurch, Hampshire, on 15 August 1863 with the dishonest manager of an impoverished &#145;fit-up&#146; company. Minor roles at a series of provincial theatres followed. In 1866&#150;7 he appeared in Charles Calvert's company at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester, where his parts included one of the three sisters in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, the Clown in <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, and the Second Citizen in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, and received some acclaim from the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>.<br>
<br>This led to Terry's London d&eacute;but, at the Surrey Theatre on 14 September 1867, as Finnikin Fusselton in <span class="italic">A Cure for the Fidgets</span>. Thereafter he played at the Lyceum and, from 1868, the Strand, taking leading parts in burlesques and comedies, before joining John Hollingshead's company at the Gaiety Theatre in 1876. Here, one of the celebrated Gaiety Quartet, with Nellie Farren, Edward W. Royce, and Kate Vaughan, he was to &#145;take burlesque to its highest peak&#146;  (Pope, 164). After leaving the Gaiety in 1885, and a period touring in the provinces as Montague Joliffe in A. W. Pinero's <span class="italic">In Chancery</span> and Chevalier Walkinshaw in the same author's <span class="italic">The Rocket</span>, Terry returned to London and leased the Olympic Theatre. He opened there on 16 December 1886 as Mr Chuffey in <span class="italic">The Churchwarden</span>, which he had adapted from a German farce.<br>
<br>Terry opened his own 800-seat theatre, Terry's, in the Strand, London, on 17 October 1887. Theatre and fittings were designed by Walter Emden to reassure the public after the recent destruction by fire of the Paris Op&eacute;ra Comique and the theatre in Exeter. There, &#145;the most amusing theatre in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1912), Terry was to earn his fortune, primarily by productions of plays by Pinero. <span class="italic">Sweet Lavender</span>, which opened on 21 March 1888, with Terry as Dick Phenyl, ran originally for 670 performances and is said to have earned him more than &pound;50,000. Among other successes, Terry's saw the first legitimate production of Frances Hodgson Burnett's own adaptation of <span class="italic">Little Lord Fauntleroy</span>, on 15 May 1888. The theatre closed on 8 October 1910, shortly after Terry had sold it. It was subsequently converted to a picture house, and was pulled down in 1923.<br>
<br>Terry took productions abroad, notably to Australia, Canada, and South Africa, as well as making many provincial tours. His last runs in London were in 1909&#150;10 at His Majesty's Theatre, as Crabtree in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> and as Uncle Gregory in W. G. Robertson's <span class="italic">Pinkie and the Fairies</span>. He played the Club Servant in the royal command performance of Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span> on 17 May 1911 at Drury Lane, and Brown in T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">David Garrick</span> at the gala performance at His Majesty's Theatre on 27 June 1911.<br>
<br>Terry was regarded as an &#145;incomparable eccentric character&#146;  (Archer, 151) and as a &#145;past master of the art of comic despair&#146;  (<span class="italic">South African News</span>, 24 Jan 1903). His voice was particularly memorable, &#145;with the shrill staccato notes of a piccolo which would suddenly run down through a whole gamut of strange sounds into the deep grunt of a bassoon&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1912). He was kind, genial, and a keen churchman. In 1889 he lectured to the church congress at Cardiff on the tensions between stage and church. He was treasurer of the Royal General Theatrical Fund between 1896 and 1911, when he became chairman. In the 1880s and 1890s he was a member of the Richmond board of guardians and, for a period, a member of the Barnes school board. From 1897 until his death he was the ruling councillor of the Barnes Habitation of the Primrose League. He was a churchwarden at Barnes parish church and held office in various other local organizations. He was a council member or trustee of a range of national as well as local charities, and became a magistrate for Surrey in 1906. Prominent in freemasonry, he was in 1889 the grand treasurer of all England. He was one of the founders, in 1898 at Barnes, of the Edward Terry Lodge.<br>
<br>Terry's first wife, Ellen Dietz (<i>c</i>.1849&#150;1897), whom he had married in 1870 and with whom he had a son and (probably) two daughters, died in 1897. On 24 October 1904 he married Florence Edgecombe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rendle, the widow of Sir Augustus Harris, the one-time lessee of Drury Lane Theatre. Terry died from cancer on 2 April 1912 at his home, Priory Lodge, Church Road, Barnes, and was buried on 6 April in Brompton cemetery.<br>
