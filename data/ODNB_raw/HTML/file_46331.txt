<span class="headword">Mowll,  Howard West Kilvinton</span>  (1890&#150;1958), <span class="occ">archbishop of Sydney</span>, was born in Dover on 2 February 1890, the eldest son of Henry Martin Mowll (<i>b</i>. 1860), solicitor, and his wife and first cousin, Gertrude Emily Worsfold (<i>d</i>. 1935). He was educated at the King's School, Canterbury, King's College, Cambridge (BA, 1912; MA, 1915; honorary DD, 1922), and Ridley Hall, Cambridge (1912&#150;13). He served a record five terms, in 1911&#150;12, as president of the evangelical Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, following its split with the Student Christian Movement. His leadership here led to his appointment as tutor (1913) and professor (1916&#150;22) at Wycliffe College, Toronto. Before emigrating he was made deacon on 21 September 1913, by Bishop E. A. Knox of Manchester for the bishop of London for the colonies, with a notional title at St James, Dover; he was priested while on leave on 7 June 1914 by Archbishop Randall Davidson of Canterbury.<br>
<br>On the nomination of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) to superintend its missions in western Szechwan (Sichuan), Mowll was consecrated assistant bishop in west China in Westminster Abbey on 24 June 1922. On 23 October 1924 in Mienchu (Mianzhu) he married a vivacious and experienced missionary, Dorothy Anne Martin (1890&#150;1957); to their grief, there were no children. In August 1925 near Mienchu, the Mowlls and other missionaries were kidnapped by red-lamp brigands, mistreated, and eventually ransomed; the incident aroused worldwide attention. Appointed diocesan of west China in 1926, he adopted the CMS policy of devolving authority upon local bishops, including native-born suffragans, as opposed to that of the China Inland Mission, which favoured European missionaries with Chinese subordinates. During a deputational tour to Australia in August 1931 Mowll so impressed leaders of the Anglican Church League, the conservative evangelical strategists of the diocese of Sydney, that in April 1933 the league secured his almost unanimous election as archbishop. He was enthroned on 13 March 1934. Liberal evangelicalism in the diocese was thereafter subjugated.<br>
<br>As archbishop, Mowll worked prodigiously and kept ungodly hours, sometimes summoning his archdeacons at two in the morning. Chaplains rarely stayed the course, but the diocese responded enthusiastically. In November 1935 he appointed the Revd T. C. Hammond, head of the Irish Church Mission, as principal of his theological college, and in May 1936 Canon Charles Venn Pilcher, of Wycliffe College, Toronto, was consecrated as his coadjutor. Pilcher never supplied the archbishop's scholarly shortcomings, but Hammond proved a tenacious defender of conservative evangelicalism. In February 1938 a group of fifty clergy active in the diocese presented him with a memorial claiming that men of one school of thought alone were preferred. Mowll declined to interview the signatories; he replied instead with a questionnaire of Hammond's devising, then sailed for Vancouver. To the public he was known for his sustained protests over the opening of the Sydney Royal Easter (Agricultural) Show on Good Friday, and for organizing an annual procession of witness on that day. During the war both he and Mrs Mowll actively promoted the Church of England National Emergency Fund; for this work, Mrs Mowll was made OBE in 1956. In December 1942 he appointed a special chaplain to youth and valued the employment agency and summer beach camps and youth conferences thus initiated.<br>
<br>In March 1935 Mowll had been narrowly defeated as primate of the Anglican church in Australia. His election to that office, in November 1947, proved the watershed of his episcopate. His perspective widened. Despite opposition from within his diocese he supported both the World Council of Churches, nationally (as president) and internationally, and also the proposed constitution for an autonomous Anglican church in Australia. He visited CMS missions and those of the evangelical Bush Church Aid Society all over the continent. After the expulsion of the CMS from China in 1949 he urged it to establish missions in New Guinea (where he toured in 1951) and south-east Asia, especially Borneo, Sarawak, and Malaya. He encouraged the formation of autonomous provinces in missionary fields worldwide, including east Africa, south Asia, and the Pacific. He and his wife loved to travel. In 1948 they attended the Lambeth conference, the first assembly of the World Council of Churches, in Amsterdam, and the International Missionary Council at Oestgeest. Almost every year thereafter they travelled abroad, for meetings of missionary councils or the World Council of Churches. After 1953 Mowll personally promoted an appeal for missions in south-east Asia. From October 1956 to January 1957 he and his wife, with other Australian bishops, made a visit to China.<br>
<br>Mowll's latter years were marked by a far-reaching post-war expansion of his diocese, though he found himself increasingly isolated because of the death or retirement of faithful retainers. Australian clergy, diocesan-trained, were consecrated as his coadjutors; the death of his wife on 23 December 1957 deprived him of his last confidante. He died unexpectedly in Sydney on 24 October 1958, and his ashes were buried beside the throne of his cathedral on 11 November.<br>
<br>A man of great height and commanding presence, and an unhesitating evangelical who proclaimed a simple gospel, Mowll became one of the most significant figures of the evangelical wing of the Anglican communion. To his many disciples within his diocese (including his biographer), he shone with a &#145;lustrous&#146; light; to his detractors he was known as Holy Mowlly. His ecumenism and his interest in missions worldwide never diminished his loyalty to the Church of England.<br>
