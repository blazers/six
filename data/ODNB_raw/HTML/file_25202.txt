<span class="headword">Shank,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">actor</span>, is of unknown origins. Fortunately his personal and professional life are better documented, thanks largely to testimony he gave to the lord chamberlain in 1635 and to the will he signed on 31 December in the same year. He had a long career as a professional actor, in 1635 describing himself as &#145;an old man in this quality&#146;  (&#145;Dramatic records&#146;, 367). His will records him as &#145;one of his Maiesties servants the players and Citizen and Weauer of london&#146;  (Honigmann and Brock, 186). He almost certainly lived in London all his life. Shank married Winifred Porter on 12 February 1610 in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West. They seem to have spent their married life in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, where they may have run a boarding house. Of their several children only Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1612), John (possibly baptized on 16 March 1616), and James (<i>bap</i>. 1619) seem to have survived into adult life. Elizabeth married someone called Bowen and had a daughter, another Winifred. John Shank's elder son was, possibly, a player at the Red Bull and the Fortune, a circumstance that has led to a certain amount of confusion between him and his father, although the younger man survived him by twenty years or so.<br>
<br>The older Shank began his acting career with Pembroke's Men some time after 1592. Later he joined the Queen Elizabeth's Men. By 1610 he was a member of the company whose patron was Prince Henry. He is named as a groom of Prince Henry's chamber on a livery list of 8 November 1612 and his name appears on a patent of 11 January 1613. This was issued when the company came under the patronage of the elector palatine or Palsgrave, a move necessitated by the death of Prince Henry in November 1612. Perhaps Shank supplied the company with the wherewithal for costumes, since on 24 December 1614 a John Shank of St Giles was involved with receiving goods stolen from a linen draper. By the end of 1618 he had left Palatine's Men and had joined the company with which he was to be associated for the rest of his life, the King's Men. Between March 1619 and May 1629 his name appears on six of their patents and livery lists. In 1624, when the King's Men got into trouble for playing <span class="italic">The Spanish Viceroy</span> without permission, he was a signatory on their letter of apology to Sir Henry Herbert, the master of the revels. He appeared in several plays known to have been in the repertoire of the King's Men. He is included on the list of principal actors in the great 1623 folio of Shakespeare's plays. No specific Shakespearian roles have been assigned to him. He seems to have specialized in comic roles and he was probably extremely thin. In Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">The Picture</span> (licensed on 8 June 1629), for example, he played the clown Hilario, one of a number of parts that may have capitalized on his physical characteristics. He appeared as Hodge A Countrey Fellowe in John Clavell's <span class="italic">The Soddered Citizen</span> (<i>c</i>.1630), a play in which one of his apprentices also took part. In or about 1632 the King's Men revived <span class="italic">The Wild Goose Chase</span>, in which he was cast as an impudent but unnamed servant. Diagoras in <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span> (revived <i>c</i>.1630) is another servant role he may have played. There are several early allusions to Shank which associate him with other comic performers, pointing out how he used to sing his own rhymes, and commenting on his dancing. He also wrote and performed jigs. His own entertainment, &#145;Shank's Ordinarie&#146;, no longer extant, was licensed for the King's Men on 16 March 1624.<br>
<br>As well as acting, writing, and providing costumes Shank performed other services for the King's Men. He was on occasions their financial agent and he also &#145;supplyed the company &hellip; with boyes&#146;  (&#145;Dramatic records&#146;, 369). These included Thomas Pollard, John Thompson, John Honeyman, Thomas Holcome, and Nicholas Burt. Some were his apprentices; it was customary for senior members of the company to teach the boy players their art. He may also have run some kind of training and/or boarding establishment for boys.<br>
<br>Shank invested in the King's Men, holding shares that had originally belonged to John Heminges. On his death in 1630 the heir, Heminges's son William sold them to Shank. It was these shares and those of the surviving members of the Burbage family that were the subject of the dispute recorded in the <span class="roman">Sharers' Papers</span> of 1635. Robert Benfield, Eyllaerdt Swanston, and Thomas Pollard, fellow King's Men, petitioned the lord chamberlain to allow them to purchase shares in the Blackfriars and the Globe theatres. Richard Burbage's widow, Winifred, by then remarried, and her brother-in-law Cuthbert objected, as did John Shank. An order was made to allow the petitioners to buy some of Shank's shares, but no agreement was reached about the price. So on 1 August 1635 the case was passed to Sir Henry Herbert for arbitration. The matter had still not been finally resolved by Shank's death in January 1636. He was buried at St Giles Cripplegate on the 27th of that month. Winifred Shank remarried some time before 26 August 1639, when she was a legatee in the will of Richard Benfield, a kinsman of the King's player.<br>
