<span class="headword">Hinsley, Sir  (Francis) Harry</span>  (1918&#150;1998), <span class="occ">cryptanalyst and historian</span>, was born on 26 November 1918 at 28 Rowland Street, Walsall, the son of Thomas Henry Hinsley, ironworks waggoner, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adey. He went to the local elementary school and then to Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, and in 1937 won a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, to read history. Although he obtained a first in part one of the historical tripos in 1939, he never completed a first or any subsequent degree. When the Second World War broke out he was recruited to the naval section at the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park. Congregated there was a group of young, highly accomplished men and women, living a completely secret life in conditions somewhat resembling a physically uncomfortable university senior common room. Young as he was, Hinsley became the leading expert on the decryption and analysis of German wireless traffic, and, particularly after the capture of German Enigma code machines and materials, which allowed their settings to be broken, played a vital role in supplying the Admiralty with crucial intelligence analysis derived from Admiral Doenitz's signals. This information helped to win the battle against U-boats in the Atlantic. His powers as an interpreter of decrypts were unrivalled and were based on an ability to sense that something unusual was afoot from the tiniest clues. He was not always believed, particularly in early days. His warning, for example, that something was happening in the Baltic just before the German invasion of Norway went unheeded.<br>
<br>Only after 1979, with the publication of the first of his five monumental volumes of <span class="italic">British Intelligence in the Second World War</span>, was it possible for Hinsley to discuss the significance of what he and others had achieved at Bletchley Park during the war. He said that the long period of enforced silence was made easier because he could at least discuss it with his wife, Hilary Brett Brett-Smith (1914&#150;1998), the daughter of Herbert Francis Brett Brett-Smith, Goldsmiths' reader in English at Oxford from 1939 to 1947, whom he married on 6 April 1946, and who had been there too. The official history dealt with both successes and failures and set out to be dispassionate in every way. It was thought to be heavy-going and dry, but Hinsley, who had wrestled with every kind of sensitivity during its writing&#151;internal and those of foreign governments, occasionally to the point of threatening to give up the whole project&#151;simply responded that &#145;it was meant to be bloodless&#146;  (personal knowledge). When all was over, however, he supplied a highly entertaining edited version of Bletchley Park memoirs under the title <span class="italic">Codebreakers: the Inside Story of Bletchley Park</span> (1993), which served to add the flesh and blood excluded from the official account. Perhaps most interesting of all was his personal assessment of the ultimate result of the intelligence effort. It had not been a &#145;war winner&#146; but was a &#145;war-shortener&#146;. He thought that the war might have been as much as two years longer without it, certainly one year. &#145;Without it&#146;, he often said, &#145;Rommel would have got to Alexandria. The U-boats would not have done us in. But they would have got us into serious shortages and put another year on the war&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Following his wartime service Hinsley returned to St John's College, Cambridge, where he had been elected a research fellow in 1944. He became a university lecturer in history in 1949, reader in the history of international relations in 1965, and professor of the history of international relations in 1969. He also served as president (1975&#150;9), then master (1979&#150;89), of St John's College, and as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University (1981&#150;3). He was a great teacher, an important writer, and a notably competent administrator. Countless generations of undergraduate historians at Cambridge remembered the extraordinarily vivid way in which he taught them, but the research school in the history of international relations that he established in the 1960s and 1970s was one of his greatest achievements. The combination of the books he himself was writing, particularly <span class="italic">Power and the Pursuit of Peace</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">Sovereignty</span> (1966), and the work that his PhD students did and subsequently published, showed interconnections between the evolution of the philosophy of international relations and the realities as they unfolded. This changed the way in which both international relations and their history were studied, and the result was an alteration in the intellectual basis of discussion. Few scholars achieve such turning points but Hinsley was one. It was particularly remarkable because, partly as a result of the war, he did not have any research training, nor did his own books proceed from empirical work: in his case, information was supplied to support an argument, not the other way round.<br>
<br>Hinsley's work demonstrated two preoccupations: the first was the evolution and function of the state, the relationships that develop between states, and the effect of this on the actions of politicians and rulers. The second was the wish to show how, taking the long view, an essentially rational interpretation of history revealed a record of progress in the conduct of affairs. His near-passion for evaluating the significance of the existence of the state did not, however, leave him able only to conceive of a state-centric world either in the past or the future. The tools he used to describe how his own world worked were equally useful in analysing the pre-state world and in predicting a very different world system in the future. Late in life he would explain with some glee that the evident transfer of power from weak states to international humanitarian institutions in some parts of the world was wholly explicable in the terms he had developed to discuss the idea of sovereignty. It is a tribute to the depth of his approach to international relations that idealists could claim him for his optimism while entirely rejecting the basis for it, and realists could feel comfortable with his techniques while being entirely unable to accept his conclusions. This was not a case of being all things to all men&#151;he was completely his own man; what he created was a quarry sufficient to supply stone for many different structures.<br>
<br>For many of his students, it was Hinsley's analytical skill so honed at Bletchley Park that affected them most. Whether in private&#151;and always unstinting&#151;discussion or at the famous weekly seminar he ran for all interested parties at every level, from behind a thick pall of pipe smoke, he reacted to the wider implications of what had been discovered or reassessed; and he would comment rapidly, almost electrically, on the true significance of what he had just heard or read. He never forgot any student he had taught or been tutor to, and his students never forgot their exposure to how he thought about things and the often striking language he used to describe what he thought. They also never forgot the risk of personal annihilation which visiting him entailed. The threat came from showers of books which could and did fall from hopelessly overstressed and ancient shelves. He had the gift of total concentration on the person he was dealing with, whatever the circumstances, and was perfectly capable of forgetting that there were often other people waiting in his room during tutorial consultations. Both the skills and the gratitude of his students were laid out in two books: <span class="italic">British Foreign Policy under Sir Edward Grey</span> (1977), which he edited, and <span class="italic">Diplomacy and Intelligence during the Second World War</span> (1985), edited by Richard Langhorne.<br>
<br>Hinsley was a strikingly rich character, almost a phenomenon of nature, in contrast to his bespectacled and physically slight appearance. He took his turn at the tasks of university administration, perhaps more as a duty than as a pleasure. He reached the peak both at college and university level, and, apart from a mild tendency to be testy with people who failed to take a common-sense view of hard realities, he was gently conservative and even sometimes parsimonious as an administrator but always as patient and persistent in this role as he was in academic life. He was made OBE for his work at Bletchley in 1946 and knighted in 1985. He died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 16 February 1998, of lung cancer, and was survived by his wife, Hilary (who died shortly after him), and by their three children, Clarissa, Hugh, and Charles.<br>
