</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Ellen Cicely</span>  (1891&#150;1947), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 8 October 1891 at 41 Coral Street, Ardwick, Chorlton upon Medlock, Manchester, the second daughter and the third among the four children of Richard Wilkinson, a cotton worker and later insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen Wood (<i>d</i>. 1916). The family lived in a terrace house with an outside privy, but they were moving up socially: three of the children went to college, two obtaining university degrees. Richard Wilkinson, from an Irish family, had a keen sense of justice and a quick temper, but he was a serious-minded pillar of his Methodist church: he gave up drink, and his wife kept the front doorstep white with regular stoning. Ellen Wilkinson inherited her father's concern for justice, whose socialist outcome reflected her Methodist background, reinforced by knowing that poor medical treatment at her own birth had produced &#145;a life of agonizing suffering&#146; for her mother: &#145;all my childhood was dominated by the fact of mother's illness&#146;, she later recalled  (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">Myself when Young</span>, 399&#150;400).<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandentrytopolitics18911924"></a>Early life and entry to politics: 1891&#150;1924</h2>The urge to speak in public came early: as a small child, Ellen and her grandmother, who was caring for her, held Sunday services together during which Ellen would stand on a chair and preach. There was much talk within the home about sermons, as well as many opportunities at religious functions for recitations, debates, and speech-making. Yet Wilkinson was not a tractable child. She resented being ousted as the youngest child by the late advent of her younger brother, just as she resented the special educational privileges boys then enjoyed. Educated at Ardwick higher elementary school and Stretford Road secondary school, she was a self-confident and rebellious pupil whose formal education was supplemented by accompanying her father to lectures on theological subjects, and in later life she continued to attend Methodist chapel whenever possible. &#145;By the time I was fourteen&#146;, she recalled, &#145;I was reading Haeckel, and Huxley and Darwin with my father&#146;  (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">Myself when Young</span>, 405). She won a pupil teacher bursary which enabled her to attend as a pupil teacher for two and a half days a week at the pupil teachers' centre in Manchester, while spending the other half of the week teaching in elementary schools.<br>
<br>By winning the Jones history entrance scholarship to Manchester University in 1910, Wilkinson opened herself up to gaining an upper second-class honours degree in history (in 1913), but much more importantly to a host of new and powerful political influences. Not the least among these was that of the one man to whom she ever became engaged, J. T. W. Newbold, the ungainly Quaker who probably first introduced her to Marxism and who strengthened her pacifism. The engagement was broken off in 1913, but there were other socialist influences, most notably the speeches of Mrs Bruce Glasier and the writings of Robert Blatchford. Wilkinson became a Fabian, joined the Independent Labour Party in 1912, and gained experience in the university's debating society which made her a confident, effective speaker and a vivid, fluent writer.<br>
<br>Thereafter Wilkinson gravitated towards public life through becoming active in a host of pressure groups and reforming organizations. Soapbox oratory, journalistic experience, assiduity in research, broadened contacts within the labour movement&#151;all this and more now came her way. In 1913 she became an organizer with the (non-violent) National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in Manchester. In 1915 she became the first national women's organizer for the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees (later the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers), retaining the post for the rest of her life; from 1919 to 1925 she represented the union on four trade boards. Active in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, she opposed the First World War and was a member of the league's mission sent in 1920 to investigate the Black and Tans' activities in Ireland; its report urged an immediate truce, with the release of Irish political prisoners. She joined the Communist Party on its formation in Britain in 1920 and visited Russia in 1921, but in 1923&#151;though still a member of the Communist Party&#151;she stood as an official Labour candidate for Ashton under Lyne, winning more than a quarter of the votes cast in a three-cornered contest but coming bottom of the poll. In the same year, however, she was elected to the Manchester city council, where she remained until 1926.<h2>
<a name="Backbencherontheleft19241940"></a>Back-bencher on the left: 1924&#150;1940</h2>In 1924 Wilkinson resigned from the Communist Party, and in three-cornered contests at the general elections of 1924 and 1929 she won Middlesbrough East for Labour. As the only woman Labour MP in the parliament of 1924, elected while still lacking the household qualification that would have qualified her to vote, she was inevitably drawn into speaking up for women. &#145;I feel sometimes that I am the Member for widows rather than the Member for Middlesbrough&#146;, she told MPs on 22 February 1928, when championing the cause of women over seventy who had been excluded from the government's pension scheme  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 22 Feb 1928, col. 1646). Like most Labour MPs at this time she championed women's interests without seeing these as distinct from those of the men in their social class, and in the split between the old and new feminism in the mid-1920s she naturally took the interventionist rather than the individualist side: equal opportunity for women to pursue careers seemed less important to her than the need to defend both sexes against economic exploitation. If she had been forced to choose between feminism and socialism, she would have chosen socialism, but so great was the democratic overlap between the two that the choice never presented itself, and she spoke up vigorously for equal franchise in 1928 and for equal pay in 1936. But when in March 1944 she had to choose between backing equal pay and supporting the wartime coalition government, it was the government that she backed in the three confidence votes held on the issue.<br>
<br>Overriding everything for &#145;our Ellen&#146;, as they called Wilkinson, was a deep and passionate loyalty to her working-class constituents. &#145;God make us worthy of the men we lead!&#146;, Dalton reported her as saying in 1926, a year in which she worked hard for the miners in the general strike  (<span class="italic">Political Diary of Hugh Dalton</span>, 40). Striking a firm note of class loyalty, she drew heavily in her parliamentary speeches on local information laced with an amusingly sarcastic wit, and was never slow to &#145;take up the cudgels&#146;, as she put it. Dorothy Elliott recalled that &#145;she was stirred by individual events and by her love of people. If she heard of oppression, wherever it might be, she had to go and see for herself, and take action&#146;. Within the labour movement &#145;her intense loyalty to people, her integrity, directness, courage, and the strength of her emotions gave her a great influence&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In her speeches Wilkinson repeatedly tried to bring home to MPs the realities of working-class life&#151;for example, by enhancing a speech on 29 June 1926 with a display of the rope and chain that Somerset miners used to drag their tubs. Like Winifred Holtby's headmistress Sarah Burton in <span class="italic">South Riding</span>, partly modelled on her, Wilkinson &#145;believed in fighting. She had unlimited confidence in the power of the human intelligence and will to achieve order, happiness, health and wisdom&#146;  (Holtby, 66). This stance prompted sharp parliamentary exchanges with Conservative women MPs, including Lady Astor, who none the less behind the scenes gave her practical help when she badly needed rest in 1929. It was in that year, in the minority Labour government, that Wilkinson became parliamentary private secretary at the Ministry of Health to Susan Lawrence, whom she admired.<br>
<br>By the late 1920s Wilkinson had complemented her rapport with the extra-parliamentary labour movement by building up a reputation within the House of Commons. With her red hair and her distinctive appearance&#151;she was the first woman MP to wear a brightly coloured dress and shingled hair&#151;she could hardly be ignored. Her slight figure&#151;she was only 4 feet 10 inches tall&#151;made her perkiness seem all the more courageous, for she was afraid of nobody. She could immediately warm up a debate with her jauntily irreverent manner, yet at the same time retain parliament's respect because it knew that the respect was mutual. So immersed was she in the life of the house that she published a light-hearted book of parliamentary sketches, <span class="italic">Peeps at Politicians</span> (1930), and a detective story, <span class="italic">Division Bell Mystery</span> (1932). With her vitality and her disarmingly wry sense of humour, unaccompanied by self-consciousness or vanity, she was a good debater who could spark humour in others. Her lightly sarcastic, sometimes even skittish speeches were ever incredulous that the Conservatives could really think as they did.<br>
<br>Yet Wilkinson was more than a good constituency MP and lively back-bencher, as Beatrice Webb in February 1927 had already perceived. Predicting &#145;a big political career&#146; for Wilkinson, Webb saw that she was &#145;becoming, unknown to herself, moulded for the Front Bench and eventually for office&#146;: she would make a good departmental minister, more efficient and popular than those Labour stateswomen Susan Lawrence and Margaret Bondfield  (Webb, <span class="italic">Diaries, 1924&#150;1932</span>, 133). Political commentators were impressed with how carefully Wilkinson prepared her case when speaking in parliament on women's pensions in 1925, and she displayed the same grasp of detail when with all-party support in 1938 she piloted through her <span class="roman">Hire Purchase Bill</span>, which ensured a fairer deal for the customer. Her commitment and knowledge were nourished by her close identification with her constituencies, Middlesbrough and Jarrow, deeply involved as they were in heavy industry. Local loyalties lay behind her eagerness in the mid-1920s, for instance, to resume trade with Soviet Russia. &#145;I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world&#146;, she told MPs in 1928: &#145;I know I do not look like it, but I do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 1 Mar 1928, col. 734).<br>
<br>At the general election of 1931 Wilkinson's percentage of the votes cast at Middlesbrough fell only slightly, but this time she faced only a single, Liberal, opponent and so was soundly defeated. &#145;Just like you middle-class people&#146;, was her retort when her Labour colleague Edith Picton-Turbervill said she would abstain in the National Government's confidence debate on 8 September 1931  (Picton-Turbervill, 258). For political and personal reasons, Wilkinson's morale in the early 1930s was low, and for a time she seems to have found consolation in Christian Science, with further help from Lady Astor. Impulsive, emotional, and an erratic judge of character, Wilkinson experienced some difficulties that were of her own making. Her domestic life was disorganized and hurried, complicated greatly by her tendency to over-commit herself to good causes and by difficulty in meeting journalistic deadlines. Things were rendered manageable only by the devoted help of her sister Annie. In 1936 the two sisters bought a cottage in Penn, a bolt-hole which brought much-needed peace and privacy. Wilkinson's personal life was also in difficulties: she asked Beatrice Webb in July 1931 whether a woman in public life should remain celibate if she had found a congenial friend with an uncongenial wife; Webb interpreted this as referring to the Labour MP and journalist, J. F. Horrabin, with whom Wilkinson had a short-lived affair.<br>
<br>Yet Wilkinson was nothing if not resilient, and in 1935 she became Labour MP for Jarrow in a straight fight. The stage was now set for one of the twentieth century's most famous identifications between MP and constituency. &#145;Nowadays&#146;, she told MPs in November 1938, &#145;any Member of Parliament for one of the distressed areas has become a kind of glorified commercial traveller for his area&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 28 Nov 1938, col. 157). Two years earlier she had led the famous march from Jarrow to London, herself walking for most of the way, and learning much from her fellow marchers about the realities of poverty. She informed parliament that a Jarrow vicar had told her how the young men there were &#145;just like eggshells. They looked all right outside, but when they were faced with the infection and cold of the winter they just cracked like eggshells&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 8 July 1936, col. 1269). On 11 November 1936 she begged MPs themselves to learn from the marchers by allowing them to appear at the bar of the house, but in vain. Three years later she educated the nation in the most important of her books, <span class="italic">The Town that was Murdered</span>, published by the Left Book Club complete with a substantial bibliography. There she used the decline of local shipbuilding to illustrate how monopoly capitalism precluded efficiency in the local iron and steel industry, and rendered irrelevant the type of &#145;remedy&#146; for Jarrow's poverty and sickness that blamed the conduct of the individual rather than a defective economic system. The remedy lay only through socialism&#151;that is, through nationalization, tax reform, and planning. &#145;Jarrow's plight is not a local problem&#146;, she wrote, &#145;it is the symptom of a national evil&#146;  (Wilkinson, <span class="italic">The Town that was Murdered</span>, 283). For a busy back-bencher to write such a well-documented and eloquent book was a formidable achievement.<br>
<br>Wilkinson had never been narrowly preoccupied with domestic policy, and in 1932 she visited India as part of a delegation from the India League; when contributing to the parliamentary debate on India on 18 April 1940 she felt able to refer to the many Indians who were her friends, including Nehru. She pleaded eloquently against using authoritarian methods against nationalists there, if only because of the bad image of Britain that this would project in the United States. Her main inter-war concern with overseas policy, however, lay closer to home: as early as April 1933 she was urging British feminists to resist Nazi discrimination against women's employment. She opposed fascism in every way open to her: helping refugees, passionately opposing non-intervention in Spain, which she visited, and seeing appeasement in 1938&#150;9 as an outcrop of upper-class self-interest. Her House of Commons attack on Chamberlain's policy on 24 August 1939 was scathing, striking a divisive note which even some of her sympathizers in parliament found distasteful, yet it was one of the most impressive parliamentary speeches on foreign policy made by any woman MP up to that date.<h2>
<a name="Ingovernment19401947"></a>In government: 1940&#150;1947</h2>In May 1940 Wilkinson became parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Pensions. The office narrowed her debating front within the House of Commons, but her contributions were crisp and well informed. In October 1940 she became joint parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Home Security, which involved her more deeply in civil defence issues. She was not the sort of minister whose effectiveness with paperwork pleases civil servants, nor was she always even-tempered. But she was good at publicity, and set an example to others with her energy and courage. She spent days and nights in bomb shelters when conditions were at their worst, and was prominent in organizing civil defence and the fire service. Wilkinson, like her party, was being edged away from opposition-mindedness by the war. Her patriotism made her intensely proud of having served in the wartime coalition, and she alone among Labour MPs gave Churchill a sympathetic cheer when he entered the House after his defeat at the general election of 1945.<br>
<br>Wilkinson never married, but her close relations with Herbert Morrison had probably become more than platonic in the late 1930s. In identifying closely with his political ambitions she made enemies on the left of the Labour Party, and she made more by backing him strongly late in 1943 when he allowed Mosley's release from prison. &#145;Little Ellen &hellip; is apt to be much too publicly emotional abt her Chief&#146;, wrote Dalton in his diary on 24 November of a discussion in the national executive committee; she &#145;makes an impassioned defence, with sobs in her throat, but it really isn't very convincing, except to the purists for civil liberty&#146;  (<span class="italic">War Diary</span>, 674). She was still backing Morrison's designs on the leadership in 1945, but she was too passionately committed to make a successful conspirator, and in this she ultimately failed. Once more she was returned for Jarrow in a straight fight, her percentage of the votes cast rising to two-thirds, and she found that her conspiracies against Attlee did not preclude her admission to his cabinet as minister of education.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's seventeen months in cabinet constituted something of an anticlimax. She was accused later of failing to advance comprehensive schools, but this is doubly anachronistic: the movement for comprehensives could not then compete with the traditional Labour Party policy of providing equal opportunity within the existing educational system; besides, the first priority at a time of post-war reconstruction and scarce resources was inevitably to implement the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> (1944). Choosing a few key areas for special effort, she won the resources and provided the necessary drive and organization to ensure free school milk and school meals, smaller classes, extensive school building, a school-leaving age raised to fifteen, and an expansion in the county colleges which would help win acceptance for education up to the age of eighteen. But she had too little time: she was severely handicapped as a minister by poor health. She had neglected her health during the war, and had inherited her father's bronchial asthma. The situation was not helped by her being prone to accidents, especially while driving, which she did in hair-raising fashion. She died at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, on 6 February 1947, of heart failure following an overdose of medication which was almost certainly accidental, while suffering from emphysema with pneumonia and acute bronchitis. Until her death she was living in a flat at Hood House, Dolphin Square, Westminster.<br>
<br>For Dorothy Elliott the effect of Wilkinson's work &#145;was rather the sum of a long series of isolated efforts than the working out of any sustained policy&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Beatrice Webb would not have been surprised. Her shrewd analysis of 1927 did not find in Wilkinson a capacity for hard thinking or spiritual insight: she would therefore be only &#145;an interpreter of other people's thoughts and intentions&#146;  (Webb, <span class="italic">Diaries, 1924&#150;1932</span>, 133). Rare is the politician who is more than this, but at least as rare is the politician who combines a capacity for hard-working and generous-minded protest against injustice with skill at channelling it towards parliamentary institutions, and who then goes on in a ministerial capacity to defend democracy energetically and courageously at its time of greatest danger.<br>
