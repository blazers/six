<span class="headword">Stoughton,  Thomas Wilberforce</span>  (1840&#150;1917), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born at Windsor, Berkshire, one of the eleven children of the nonconformist theologian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26606/', "John Stoughton DD (1807&#150;1897)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Vyse, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of George Cooper of Windsor. Only Thomas and three of his sisters survived to adulthood. Stoughton's education and experience included a year's study in Berlin, where he found friends among the Moravians. He worked in a London shipping office before being apprenticed to the evangelical publishing house of James Nisbet &amp; Co. On 16 June 1868 he went into partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39010/', "Matthew Henry Hodder")</script> to establish the publishing house of Hodder and Stoughton at 27 Paternoster Row, London. Dr John Stoughton's acquaintance with E. V. Walford, of his publishers Jackson, Walford, and Hodder, may have forwarded the link between Thomas and M. H. Hodder. Various occasions have been suggested for Stoughton's acquaintance with Hodder: both were in the orbit of the Congregationalist Dr Thomas Binney, and both fathers had lived in Windsor. <br>
<br>On 5 November 1868 Stoughton married Maxwell Gordon Lindsay Graeme (<i>bap</i>. 1842, <i>d</i>. 1927), only daughter of Alexander Rae Thomson, then deceased. The marriage was performed by John Stoughton in Kensington Chapel. They had two sons, John and Cecil, and a daughter, May. <br>
<br>From the firm's inception Stoughton paid attention to its finances and travelled the west of England and Scotland; in 1885 he recruited the Revd William Robertson Nicoll, Free Church minister at Kelso, as editor of <span class="italic">The Expositor</span> in place of Dr Samuel Cox, whose doctrine of eternal punishment was unacceptable to the partners. Stoughton's affinity for things Scottish brought to the firm's lists kailyard fiction and Scottish theology and, with trepidation, George Adam Smith's <span class="italic">The Book of Isaiah</span> (2 vols., 1880&#150;90), which first established that there were two Isaiahs. The firm acquired influence in affairs through its periodicals, especially the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span> (1886&#150;1946). Stoughton's politics were Liberal-nonconformist but imperialism was his chief conviction; he argued that Britain should prepare for attack by Germany. He built a mission room at Norwood, and from this congregation came many employees of Hodder and Stoughton. <br>
<br>Thomas Stoughton was rotund with a falsetto voice, fastidious in dress, universally courteous, wary but persistent. He enjoyed cricket at Lord's, and drove a horse carriage to town, refusing to own a motor car. After the death of Matthew Hodder, and already suffering from severe arthritis, he withdrew from active business. He died at his home, 34 Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, London, on 20 February 1917. After a memorial service in Auckland Hall, his mission room, he was buried in Norwood cemetery on 24 February.<br>
