<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carnegie,  Andrew</span>  (1835&#150;1919), <span class="occ">steelmaker and philanthropist</span>, was born in Moodie Street, Dunfermline, Fife, on 25 November 1835, the eldest of three children of William Carnegie (<i>d</i>. 1855), a damask linen weaver, and his wife, Margaret. After the age of eight he was educated at a Lancastrian school. Other influences on him&#151;aside from his parents' poverty&#151;were his family's nonconformity (his father was a Swedenborgian) and its Chartist sympathies.<h2>
<a name="Fromragstoriches"></a>From rags to riches</h2>In 1848 the depression in the linen trade prompted the Carnegies to emigrate to the United States, where they joined relatives in Pittsburgh in the picturesquely named district of Slabtown, Allegheny. Andrew Carnegie began work at the age of thirteen as a bobbin-boy in a cotton factory at a weekly wage of $1.20, thus beginning a classic rise from &#145;rags to riches&#146;. The early phase of his career, up to about 1863&#151;by which time he had already acquired the income of a dollar millionaire&#151;was characterized by his energy, his ability to attract the attention and help of those in authority, and his unerring knack of being in the right industry at the right time. By 1850 he had become a messenger-boy at the O'Reilly Telegraph Company in Pittsburgh. Three years later he was appointed clerk and telegraph operator to Thomas A. Scott, assistant superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. According to Carnegie, &#145;the great aim of every boy should be to do something beyond the sphere of his abilities&#151;something which attracts the attention of those over him&#146;  (Wall, 126). Carnegie did just that, and Scott rewarded him with ever greater authority and also loaned his assistant the capital to invest in the Adams Express stock, the dividends from which gave Carnegie his first taste of capitalism. Another investment soon after, in the Woodruff Sleeping Car Company, proved the basis of his great fortune. In 1859 Scott became vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and appointed Andy (as Carnegie was known) to take his former post as superintendent of the western division of the line. A short man&#151;only 5 feet 3 inches tall&#151;Carnegie grew a beard to disguise his youth, as he was at the time only twenty-four. A hard taskmaster, he quickly proved himself a most effective manager on one of the busiest divisions of what was then the nation's best-managed railroad.<br>
<br>By the time of the American Civil War, Carnegie's interests had diversified: besides the Woodruff Sleeping Car Company (ultimately absorbed by the Pullman Car Company, a deal which he helped negotiate), he had interests in the Columbia Oil Company, a scheme for building telegraph lines, a project for establishing a sutler's business for the army, a horse-trading concern, a bridge-building company, a locomotive works, and several other ventures. Nearly all of these made money and by 1868, when he had moved to New York, he had assets of $400,000 and an annual income of over $56,000. He seriously considered retiring at the age of thirty-five, declaring in a private note to himself that: &#145;No idol was more debasing than the worship of money&#146;  (Wall, 225). However, by then wider horizons beckoned.<br>
<br>Carnegie's railroad experience convinced him that an even greater fortune could be made in the iron and steel industry. It was one of the reasons why after the civil war he had organized the Keystone Bridge Company in Pittsburgh. Having become even more convinced of the potential of the new Bessemer process on a visit to England in 1872, he decided to commit himself more fully to the iron and steel business during the depression of 1873. His key decision was to invest $250,000 in the Edgar Thomson Steel Company, formed in 1874 with a capital of $1 million. The Bessemer plant at the company's site at Braddock's Field, near Pittsburgh&#151;laid out by the engineer Alexander Holley&#151;was designed to manufacture rails. Carnegie's huge success with this venture was due first to his commitment to technological change and second to his previous experience with the railroads. He wanted to have the most modern equipment available and was willing, if necessary, to scrap expensive machinery after only a short time if better technology could be had. The administrative structure he put together at the Edgar Thomson works was similar to the one he had worked in at the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. He appointed the country's most talented steel engineer, Captain William Jones, as general superintendent to oversee the daily work of the managers in charge of the blast furnaces, Bessemer converters, and other departments of the works.<h2>
<a name="Businessattitudesandtactics"></a>Business attitudes and tactics</h2>As general manager, Carnegie selected William P. Shinn, a highly competent railroad executive who had been appointed the general agent of the Pennsylvania company when it was formed in 1871. Shinn introduced methods (copied from the railroads) of generating statistical data, which allowed Carnegie to become an early exponent of cost accounting. He insisted on knowing the exact expense of every operation and did his best to reduce costs. His maxim was: watch the costs and the profits will take care of themselves. He also appreciated the need to control raw materials in order to assure continuous operations and minimize costs. He purchased ore lands in the Lake Superior region, acquired boats and ore-handling facilities, and joined forces in 1884 with Henry Clay Frick (1849&#150;1919), who controlled the great Connesville coal beds. Carnegie Bros. &amp; Co.&#151;the head of this large vertical combine&#151;was formed in 1881 with a capital of $5 million; its chairman was Tom Carnegie (1843&#150;1886), Andrew's brother, though after 1889 Frick held the post. Andrew Carnegie himself had no title, though he controlled 55 per cent of the capital in the partnership, which made a profit of $2 million in its first year. In 1887, a year after the death of his mother, he married, on 22 April, Louise Whitfield (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of John W. Whitfield, a prosperous merchant; they had one daughter, Margaret.<br>
<br>Carnegie had a remarkable talent for picking men from the ranks and he gave a good deal of freedom to his youthful executives (his &#145;young geniuses&#146;, as he liked to refer to them). Besides Jones and Frick, Charles Schwab, who later became president of the United States Steel Corporation, was another notable recruit. But there was a cost: job security was poor and managers were expended as ruthlessly as old machinery if they did not perform. Tom, Carnegie's brother, was driven to drink by the pressure of running the company and died prematurely. Carnegie's attitude to labour was equally unsentimental: like most American steelmasters, he regarded labour as primarily an item of cost. Although the introduction of machinery had reduced much of the employees' toil in the furnaces, compared to European workers, American labourers in Carnegie's mills (and in other steelworks) soon found their wages reduced and their unions undermined. Carnegie's (and Frick's) policies led in 1892 to a bloody showdown with the unions at the company's works in Homestead, Pennsylvania, when both sides suffered injury. (Even Frick was shot and stabbed, though he soon recovered.) Carnegie's reputation with the public was also harmed by the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, especially so since his book <span class="italic">Triumphant Democracy</span> (1886) expounded his theories of philanthropy and democracy. Nevertheless, he and Frick had removed steel unionism from their steelworks.<br>
<br>Carnegie's ruthless business tactics paid dividends during the bitter depression years of the 1890s, when the recurrent price wars and the economies of scale possessed by large-scale production resulted in many of his rivals failing to survive. Meanwhile, Carnegie thrived. By the end of the 1890s his business had profits of $20 million. For the year 1900 they stood at $40 million. After the mergers of the 1890s, however, the Carnegie company itself began to face stiff competition in selling ingots to specialized producers. When Carnegie threatened to enter the market for finished products&#151;thus raising the spectre of another vicious price war&#151;a number of his rivals persuaded the New York banker J. P. Morgan to arrange a massive consolidation that would absorb Carnegie's interests and those of other competitors. After much negotiation (during which Carnegie succeeded in forcing out Frick), the United States Steel Corporation was formed&#151;the world's first billion-dollar company&#151;and Carnegie sold out his interest. As John D. Rockefeller had done in oil, Carnegie had accumulated one of the greatest fortunes the world had ever seen: his share from the transaction was a staggering $447 million.<h2>
<a name="ThephilanthropistofSkibo"></a>The philanthropist of Skibo</h2>At the age of sixty-five Carnegie went into &#145;retirement&#146;, with his wife and daughter, to his 30,000 acre estate at Skibo in Sutherland, Scotland. Now a white-bearded and kind-faced patriarch, he could play the Scottish laird at his estate, and guests were led into dinner by a piper. However, his main interests after 1900 lay in other directions. No longer a businessman, he still retained his energy, wealth, and desire to make things happen in the world. This was to be achieved by his second career as America's first great philanthropist and a new role as an international pacifist.<br>
<br>Like many men of influence and wealth, Carnegie was unable to resist trying to put the world to rights. He was largely self-taught and an avid reader, especially of Herbert Spencer, whose social Darwinism appealed to him. However, his actions were not always consistent with Spencer's ideas (a writer he never entirely understood). A friend of Spencer and also of Matthew Arnold, he was closely associated with such Liberal statesmen as W. E. Gladstone and John Morley. Like Cecil Rhodes, he helped to finance the Gladstonian Liberal Party after the split over home rule in 1886 and he offered Gladstone an interest-free loan of any size to set him up privately; the offer was declined. Through Gladstone as an intermediary, Carnegie bought Lord Acton's library and allowed the historian to keep it during his lifetime; after Acton's death Carnegie gave the library to John Morley, who gave it to Cambridge University.<br>
<br>A ruthless conservative in America, Carnegie posed as a Chartist and radical in Britain, where by 1884 he owned or controlled seven daily newspapers and weeklies. In his writing, too, he tried to reconcile his radical Dunfermline past with his more plutocratic present. The same man who cut workers' wages and unsentimentally refused to loan money to help Thomas Scott when he had business problems later in his career, began after the 1880s to expound the virtues of the &#145;wise distribution&#146; of his wealth. &#145;The man who dies thus rich, dies disgraced&#146;, declared Carnegie, a doctrine that received its fullest expression in his book <span class="italic">The Gospel of Wealth</span> (1900). In his view, plutocracy such as his could exist alongside democracy, but men who acquired great wealth must return it to the community to preserve individual initiative. Thus the wealthy were but a trustee and an agent for their poorer brethren, albeit of the better and aspiring sort. His &#145;scientific philanthropy&#146; was to be carefully targeted according to a list of seven priorities. These were headed by his over-riding concerns&#151;universities and free libraries&#151;with churches in seventh place (an indication perhaps of his lukewarm interest in organized religion). His interest in libraries dated back to his early days as a messenger-boy in Pennsylvania, when each Saturday he borrowed a new book from a free library. He later declared that it was his own personal experience which led him to value a library beyond all other forms of beneficence.<br>
<br>Carnegie's giving had begun as early as 1873 when he had donated $25,000 to the Dunfermline swimming baths, but it gathered pace after the publication of his &#145;gospel&#146;. Within five years he gave libraries to Allegheny and to Fairfield in Iowa, while several Scottish cities, such as Edinburgh and Aberdeen, were similarly endowed. In &#145;old smoky&#146; Pittsburgh he founded a great civic educational centre&#151;the Carnegie Institute. By 1900 his programme for founding libraries had become, from his house on East 91st Street in New York, as organized a business as that of churning out steel ingots. His acceptance of freedoms of cities and other civic honours also became routine. (At one stage he accepted six freedoms in six days, eventually reaching a record total of fifty-seven such awards by the end of his life.) Not surprisingly, his critics dismissed his philanthropy as mere publicity-seeking. However, not all his giving was well-publicized.<br>
<br>As well as free libraries, Carnegie's philanthropic vehicles included the Carnegie Teachers' Pension Fund, which targeted underpaid college personnel and pensionless professors with an endowment of $10 million. Yet despite his enthusiasm in the 1890s and early 1900s for philanthropy, he had made little impression on his great fortune (which was hardly surprising, in view of the fact that the interest on his capital was $15 million a year). He needed to disperse his fortune faster. After 1900 he began using trusts to administer his charitable gifts. After trying out the idea in Washington and Dunfermline, in 1911 he created the Carnegie Corporation of New York as his major vehicle for the &#145;advancement and diffusion of knowledge&#146;. He transferred to it the bulk of his remaining fortune of $125 million. In 1913 he established, under a separate endowment, a British version of the New York trust. Bored with philanthropy, he had now given away 90 per cent of his fortune and was content to leave the direction of it to others. Eventually the trusts founded 2811 free public libraries, of which 1946 were in the USA and 660 in Britain.<h2>
<a name="Thepeacemaker"></a>The peacemaker</h2>Carnegie's other great enthusiasm after leaving steel making was his quest for world peace. Despite his early jingoism, he became a convinced pacifist after 1900. Between 1903 and 1914 he endowed four foundations and three imposing buildings (&#145;temples of peace&#146;), the largest of which was in The Hague. Also linked with his pacifism was the idea of a Simplified Spelling Board, which aimed to facilitate communication (it proved a total failure); and his Hero Fund, which rewarded peaceful (as opposed to warlike) individual acts of heroism. In 1910 he created the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to hasten the abolition of war. An optimistic man, who had commanded whole industries and labour forces to do his bidding, Carnegie believed that peace could be organized on similarly rational lines. The businessman who had been a ruthless and machiavellian negotiator, and who had broken cartels and agreements to achieve his ends, now proved to have a na&iuml;ve faith in international treaties and peace organizations. He proposed a league of peace, with the major superpowers&#151;Great Britain, the USA, Germany, Russia, and France&#151;acting as a kind of international peace force through a world court at The Hague. He also liked meddling in foreign affairs by writing to and meeting presidents, emperors, chancellors, and prime ministers. Much of his faith for the future was placed on Kaiser Wilhelm II and President Theodore Roosevelt. He counted the latter as a friend, even though their views rarely coincided, especially where naval rearmament was concerned. The First World War was therefore a considerable disillusionment to him and he did not long outlive it. He died at Lenox, Massachusetts, on 11 August 1919. By then his benefactions totalled over $350 million, leaving a fortune of a mere $30 million (two-thirds of which was left to the Carnegie Corporation). He was survived by his wife. Carnegie's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> was published posthumously in 1920. His name is perpetuated in Britain by a number of trusts, notably the Carnegie United Kingdom, Dunfermline, and Hero trusts.<br>
