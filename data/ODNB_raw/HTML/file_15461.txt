<span class="headword">Ker <span class="st"> [Kerr]</span>,  Mark</span>  (1517&#150;1584), <span class="occ">landowner and administrator</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15445/', "Sir Andrew Ker (d. 1526)")</script> of Cessford, Roxburghshire, and Agnes, daughter of Sir Patrick Crichton of Cranstoun Riddel, Edinburghshire, was born in Edinburgh Castle, of which Sir Patrick was then keeper. After graduating MA from St Andrews University he held several church livings, which he was dispensed to hold although under the canonical age. In 1547 the pope provided him to the abbacy of Newbattle, to be held <i>in commendam</i> during the lifetime of the existing abbot James Haswell, and two years later he was dispensed from taking monastic vows. Technically a cleric, he remained the recognized heir to the properties of his powerful border family after the direct heirs of his brother, Sir Walter Ker. In 1555 he was accused of killing a French soldier in a fracas at Newbattle. He gained personal possession of the abbey estates in 1557 on Abbot Haswell's death.<br>
<br>Ker sat in parliament in 1558 and probably in the provincial council of the Scottish church in 1559 (no list of those attending survives). At the same time he associated with the party that favoured religious reform and <i>rapprochement</i> with England. He subscribed to the protestant Band of Leith in April 1560, and sat in the so-called Reformation Parliament the following August, voting for the adoption of the protestant confession of faith. He became an extraordinary lord of session and privy councillor in 1569 and sat on several government commissions and inquiries. In 1572 he was a negotiator with Queen Mary's remaining supporters, and he was one of three judges appointed to settle disputes (from the country south of the River Tay) arising from the terms of the pacification of Perth (23 February 1573). In 1575 and 1580 he was appointed to border commissions. Initially a supporter of the regent Morton, he was on the council which carried on the government on the latter's resignation in 1578 and took part in attempts at reconciliation with Morton's representatives. He became a close ally of Esm&eacute; Stewart, made duke of Lennox, who arrived from France in 1579, and who some feared might become a focus for a revival of the queen's cause or even of the Roman Catholic faith. Ker, himself a protestant, was sent by Lennox to attempt an accommodation with the ultra-protestant party after the Ruthven raid (1582), in which that party tried to remove the king from Lennox's influence.<br>
<br>Having shed his clerical character for a lay career, and having survived the political storms of the new reign, Ker also exploited the resources of the Newbattle lands which he had acquired on the eve of the Reformation settlement. Through an extensive programme of feuing, which sometimes involved the eviction of long-settled leasehold tenants, the development of coal workings and salt pans, and the sales of wool from huge flocks of sheep, Ker became a wealthy man, possessed at death of an estate valued at just over &pound;16,000 Scots. He treated the surviving monks of Newbattle harshly, turning them out and only reluctantly paying their maintenance even after they took him to law. He converted the monastic site into a family home which, extended by his descendants, is one of the few Scottish country houses to take its name from the monastery it replaced.<br>
<br>Some time after 1560 Ker married Lady Helen Leslie (<i>d</i>. 1594), daughter of George, fourth earl of Rothes, and widow of Gilbert Seton the younger of Parbroath, with whom he had formed a relationship in the late 1550s. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15462/', "Mark Ker, later first earl of Lothian")</script>, was born before 20 February 1559, when he and his mother had a charter of abbey lands from the commendator. Their other children were Andrew of Fenton, George, who became a Roman Catholic and was involved in the affair of the so-called Spanish blanks in 1592, William, and Katherine, who married William Maxwell, fourth Lord Herries, from a Roman Catholic recusant family. Ker also had an illegitimate daughter, Margaret, who married John Crawford of Roughsallow, Lanarkshire, while Helen Leslie had a son, David, and a daughter, Janet, from her first marriage. Mark Ker died, at Newbattle, on 19 August 1584, and his wife died on 26 October 1594. They were buried at Newbattle, and both left wills.<br>
