<span class="headword">Conway,  William Augustus</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>William Augustus Rugg]</span>  (1789&#150;1828), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, London, and was educated under a clergyman named Payne in Barbados, where he had been sent to live with friends of his mother. He returned to England in weak health at the age of eighteen. In Bath he saw a play for the first time and developed a longing for the stage strong enough to triumph over his family's objections. Accordingly he appeared at Chester as Zanga in Edward Young's tragedy <span class="italic">The Revenge</span>, with such success that the manager, Macready, offered him an engagement. After playing varied roles in many northern and midland towns, from Macbeth to Glen Alvon in John Home's <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, he appeared in 1812 at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, in the parts vacated by J. G. Holman, who had gone to America. There, it is said, he formed a violent but unavailing passion for Eliza O'Neill, with whom he acted. He also met Charles Mathews, who recommended him to Covent Garden, where he made his London d&eacute;but on 4 October 1813, as Alexander the Great in a piece of that name altered from Lee's <span class="italic">Rival Queens</span>. During the season he played various Shakespearian characters, including Petruchio, Orlando, Othello, Romeo, Coriolanus, Henry V, and Antony in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>. Jaffier in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, Alonzo in <span class="italic">The Revenge</span>, Rolla in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, and other parts of importance were assigned him, though, as the company at Covent Garden included Charles Young and Charles Kemble, he had occasionally to take secondary roles. The season of 1815&#150;16 added to his list of characters Macbeth, Theseus in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, Beverley in Edward Moore's <span class="italic">The Gamester</span>, Posthumus in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, and Henry V in Garrick's <span class="italic">Jubilee</span>, acted on 23 April 1816 for the Shakespeare bicentenary. Conway then disappeared from Covent Garden, and was next heard of in Bath, where he performed in March 1817 Joseph Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. He stayed in Bath until 1820, playing a range of characters in tragedy and comedy, and in July 1821 appeared at the Haymarket as Lord Townly in John Vanbrugh's &#145;The Provoked Husband&#146;. Here he remained during the season, at the end of which he withdrew from the English stage. A malignant attack upon him, said to be by the dramatist Theodore Hook, was the cause of his retirement.<br>
<br>A curious circumstance in Conway's life was the infatuation for him shown, on his appearance in London, by the friend of Dr Johnson Hester Lynch Piozzi, then almost eighty years of age. It was rumoured that Conway showed Charles Mathews a letter from her offering him marriage. In the sale of Conway's effects in New York after his death, there figured a copy of Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>, on which was written, &#145;Presented to me by my dearly attached friend, the celebrated Mrs Piozzi&#146;. More sensible conduct is, however, generally assigned her, and the authenticity of <span class="italic">The Love Letters of Mrs Piozzi, Written when she was Eighty, to Aug. W. Conway</span> (London 1843) is disputed. Conway's conduct, at least, appears to have been honourable. There are records of his having been sent a cheque by Mrs Piozzi for &pound;500, a few days before her death in May 1821, which he returned to the executors of her will, declining to take advantage of what he considered a posthumous grant, even though at the time he was in need of money.<br>
<br>At the close of 1823 Conway started for America, and appeared on 12 January 1824 at the Park Theatre in New York, where he played Coriolanus, Lord Townly, Beverley, Petruchio, and other parts with great success. Later he delivered in New York some religious discourses. Early in 1828 he took a passage to Charleston. When the vessel arrived off Charleston bar, Conway threw himself overboard, and was drowned. He was a good actor and might well have been on the threshold of a brilliant career. He was, however, self-conscious, ill at ease, and morbidly sensitive to criticism, which could have been a reason for his suicide.<br>
<br>In 1863, Conway's son Frederick Bartlett Conway (1819&#150;1874), with his wife, Sarah Crocker (1834&#150;1875), opened the first theatre in Brooklyn, the Park Theatre. They also opened the Brooklyn Theatre in 1871.<br>
