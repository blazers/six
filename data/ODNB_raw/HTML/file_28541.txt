<span class="headword">Wallace,  Robert</span>  (1773&#150;1855), <span class="occ">politician and postal reformer</span>, was born in Glasgow, the second son of John Wallace (1712&#150;1805) of Cessnock and Kelly in Ayrshire, and his third wife, Janet, third daughter of Robert Colquhoun of the island of St Kitts. His father was a merchant in Glasgow, who amassed a large fortune trading in the West Indies and became proprietor of several important estates. Wallace's older brother was Sir James Maxwell Wallace [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28532/', "Wallace, Grace")</script>]. He married, on 3 January 1804, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1782), daughter of Sir William Forbes of Craigievar, fifth baronet; they had no children.<br>
<br>By his father's will Robert Wallace received the estate of Kelly and part of the West Indian property, and was known by the designation of Wallace of Kelly. He became a partner in the firm of Wallace Hunter, and after slave emancipation he was a claimant for a share of compensation amounting to nearly &pound;10,000 for over 500 enslaved people in Jamaica. The treatment of apprentices on his estates at Westmoreland, Jamaica, of which he was the absentee owner, was criticized by Joseph Sturge and Thomas Harvey in their account of their visit to the West Indies in 1836&#150;7.<br>
<br>Wallace was a devoted whig, and, as a vigorous orator, his services were in demand during the reform agitation before 1832. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> he was the first member of parliament for Greenock under the act, and held that seat continuously until 1846. In parliament his chief efforts were directed towards law reform, especially cheaper and simpler methods for the transfer of heritable property; though he did not carry through any measure specially for this purpose, he gave an impetus to reforms, and suggested plans that were subsequently adopted. In 1833 Wallace attacked the Post Office as expensive and inefficient: the pressure he exerted on the government led in 1835 to the appointment of a royal commission to which he gave evidence. After inaction from the tories in 1834&#150;5, the whigs in 1837 made Wallace chairman of a select committee to examine Rowland Hill's plan for a penny post; Wallace's committee offered unqualified support when it reported in 1838, the penny post being enacted in 1839.<br>
<br>In 1846 Wallace became embarrassed financially by the depreciation in value of some of his West Indian estates, and deemed it prudent to resign his seat in parliament. The estate of Kelly was sold, and Wallace lived in retirement at Seafield Cottage, Greenock. After his resignation a liberal public subscription was made for him, which provided an annuity of &pound;500 p.a. Wallace died at Seafield on 1 April 1855. His sister, Anne Wallace, died unmarried in 1873 in her 102nd year.<br>
