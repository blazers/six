<span class="headword">Willis,  Henry</span>  (1821&#150;1901), <span class="occ">organ builder</span>, was born on 27 April 1821 in north-west London, the eldest of four sons of Henry Willis, a carpenter. His father was also an amateur musician who sang in the choir of the Surrey Chapel, Blackfriars, and played the timpani in the orchestra of the Cecilian Society.<br>
<br>At an early age Willis learned to play the organ and acquired a knowledge of its design and mechanisms. His interest in the development of pedal boards stemmed from playing the pedal harpsichord of George Cooper, Attwood's assistant at St Paul's Cathedral. At the age of fourteen he was articled to the London organ builder John Gray (<i>d</i>. 1849), founder of Gray and Davison. During his apprenticeship he became organist at Christ Church, Hoxton, but his claim to have designed a new system of manual-to-pedal couplers during this period should be viewed with caution. Between 1842 and 1845 he was employed by the Cheltenham violinist and instrument maker Wardle Eastland Evans, with whom he collaborated in the development of his organ harmonica. This two-octave free-reed instrument (similar to the Serafina), was expanded into the &#145;model organ&#146; of two manuals and pedals which was exhibited at the London showrooms of the music publisher Alfred Novello and at the Hanover Square Rooms.<br>
<br>After rebuilding the organs of Tewkesbury Abbey (1846) and Gloucester Cathedral (1847), the latter of which he described as his &#145;stepping stone to fame&#146;, Willis was &#145;presumptuous enough to marry&#146;, on 7 April 1847, his organ pupil Esther Maria Chatterton, daughter of Randall Chatterton, a London silversmith. There were five children: two sons&#151;Vincent (<i>b</i>. 1848) and Henry (II) (<i>b</i>. 1852), who became partners in 1878&#151;and three daughters. After his wife's death in 1893 Willis married her sister Rosetta on 7 August 1894 at St Luke's Church, Osney Crescent, Kentish Town.<br>
<br>By 1848 Willis had returned to London and established his workshop in Foundling Terrace, Gray's Inn Road. His meteoric rise to fame with his organ for the Great Exhibition of 1851 was due to the patronage of Sir James Tyler. In order to construct this revolutionary instrument he took larger premises in Manchester Street, Argyle Square. Erected on the west gallery of the exhibition palace in Hyde Park, it comprised three manuals and pedals with seventy stops, pneumatic action, and thumb pistons located between the manuals for rapid changes of registration. It was visited by Queen Victoria and the prince consort, and as a result of a demonstration by W. T. Best, Willis was awarded the contract to build an organ in St George's Hall, Liverpool (1854&#150;5). After the exhibition the instrument was rebuilt in Winchester Cathedral at the instigation of Samuel Sebastian Wesley. In 1859 he moved his works to 119 Albany Street, Regent's Park. At the Industrial Exhibition of 1862 Willis exhibited an organ which was afterwards installed in the Alexandra Palace, where it was destroyed in a fire in 1873. Finally, in 1863 Willis moved to The Rotunda in Rochester Place, Camden Town.<br>
<br>With the organ of the Royal Albert Hall (1871) Willis attained maturity as a builder of concert instruments. A year later his instrument for St Paul's Cathedral solved the mechanical and aesthetic problems of siting a large divided organ to the satisfaction of musicians and ecclesiologists. Other cathedral organs by Willis included: Canterbury (1866 and 1886), Carlisle (1856), Durham (1876), St Mary's, Edinburgh (1879), Glasgow (1879), Hereford (1879 and 1892&#150;3), Lincoln (1898), Oxford (1884), St David's (1883), Salisbury (1876&#150;7), Truro (1887), and Wells (1857 and 1891). After rebuilding and restyling, few of Willis's organs have survived without significant alterations. Among the few exceptions, albeit still with minor changes, are the organs of Lambourne parish church (1858), Reading town hall (1864 and 1882), and Truro Cathedral.<br>
<br>As the creator of many facets of the English Romantic organ, Willis was a successful assimilator and developer of European influences. During visits to France in 1848 and 1849 he met Cavaill&eacute;-Coll and Barker. French influence was most obvious in the organs of the Royal Albert Hall and the Alexandra Palace. Some German qualities were also evident in his organs, drawn from the <i>lieblich</i> flutes and string timbres in the organs by the Schulze family shown at the Great Exhibition and elsewhere. Nevertheless, Willis's use of French stop nomenclatures and metal harmonic flutes reflect the extent of his Gallic taste.<br>
<br>The foundations of Willis's success lay in his excellence as an inventor and engineer and in the personal attention that he paid to every aspect of production. He registered nineteen patents between 1851 and 1893. These included developments of actions; improvements to the key repetition qualities of the Barker lever action, by applying balanced exhaust and throttle valves (the &#145;floating lever&#146;, as used at Truro Cathedral); and the electro-pneumatic action at Canterbury Cathedral (1886), which functioned efficiently for sixty years. His combination pistons (applied at Hereford Cathedral in 1893) were an advance on Cavaill&eacute;-Coll's ventil system. Other innovations concerned blowing machinery (gas, water, and steam engines), crescendo pedals, and the radiating and concave pedalboard.<br>
<br>The rich and clearly focused tone colours at every dynamic level of Willis's organs reflect the insight he gained into nineteenth-century trends in orchestral instruments and orchestration through his practical experience as a double bass player. This wider musical perspective led him to advance the adoption of equal-temperament tuning in Britain. Through his own systems of pipe scaling and voicing he created, in both individual flue ranks and choruses, a distinctive accord of diverse tone colours with a balance of harmonics and clarity of texture. Solo and character stops were finished to a meticulous standard. Although Willis's development of high-pressure reeds with harmonic trebles reflected the work of Cavaill&eacute;-Coll, he continued to use closed and weighted shallots and full-length resonators. Moreover, the influence in this field of his brother George (<i>b</i>. 1826), who trained with J. J. Bishop and John Courcelle, should not be underestimated.<br>
<br>Although much less deferential to native traditions than his rival William Hill, Willis continued to reflect some aspects of the work of Gray, notably the tierce in his mixtures. Up to the 1860s he was more conservative in his church instruments, but later examples contained more foundation ranks, reed, and orchestral stops. The influence of W. T. Best, the consultant at Wallasey parish church (1861), led Willis towards the characteristically English &#145;full swell&#146; ensemble, dominated by high-pressure reeds. Willis also responded to the work of the Revd John Baron in the provision of small chancel instruments for village churches, and constructed some two hundred &#145;Scudamore&#146; organs to designs inspired by medieval illustrations.<br>
<br>A profile of Willis by F. G. Edwards in <span class="italic">The Musical Times</span> of May 1898 described him as small in build, but highly charged with nervous energy. Edwards also noted his strong personality, &#145;obstinate perseverance&#146;, and extraordinarily thorough and very painstaking concern over every detail of his work. He concluded by conferring on him the title Father Willis. Willis's passionate recreation was yachting, and although his first vessel, the <i>Vigilant</i>, was run down in the Solent by a German tramp steamer in 1878, he later circumnavigated the British Isles in his third yacht, the <i>Opal</i>.<br>
<br>Willis died on 11 February 1901, at his home, Argyle Villa, 2 Bartholomew Road, Kentish Town, from acute pneumonia and cardiac failure, and was buried on 18 February in Highgate cemetery. His death was precipitated by a letter from George Riseley, organist of the Colston Hall, Bristol, complaining of the poor tone qualities of the new instrument, which had been supervised by Willis's son Henry.<br>
