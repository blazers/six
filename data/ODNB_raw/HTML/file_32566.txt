<span class="headword">Corbett,  John</span>  (1817&#150;1901), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, born at The Delph, Brierley Hill, Staffordshire, on 12 June 1817, was the eldest son in a family of five sons and one daughter of Joseph Corbett and his wife, Hannah. The father, originally a Shropshire farmer, moved to Staffordshire to become a carrier of merchandise by canal boats. John, after attending as a child Mr Geary's school at Brierley Hill, helped on his father's boats from the age of ten to twenty-three. He devoted his leisure to an unaided study of mechanical problems, and in 1840, at the mature age of twenty-three, was apprenticed for five years to W. Lester, chief engineer of Messrs Hunt and Brown of the Leys ironworks, Stourbridge. In 1846 he reluctantly abandoned the career of an engineer to become his father's partner, and under the name of Corbett &amp; Son a prosperous business was carried on, a large fleet of boats being maintained between the Staffordshire district and London, Liverpool, Manchester, and other commercial centres. In 1852 the business was sold, the advent of railways threatening to decrease canal traffic, and Corbett then bought the Stoke Prior salt works near Droitwich. In April 1856 he married Anna Eliza, daughter of John O'Meara of co. Tipperary. They had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Salt had been discovered at Stoke Prior in 1828 but efforts to extract it had been frustrated by the local geology. Corbett was aware that he was taking a risk in purchasing the premises of two defunct companies, which faced each other across the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. With a firm grasp of the mechanical, commercial, and economic problems, however, Corbett completely transformed the enterprise. He installed new brine pits lined with cast-iron cylinders to prevent the inflow of fresh water, and introduced a novel process whereby a system of pipes doubled the intensity of both the fire-heat and steam, yielding a whiter, more finely grained salt than was obtainable elsewhere, the size of the grain or crystal depending on the temperature at which the brine was evaporated. Fifty canal boats were acquired, and tributaries were excavated from the canal to the warehouses in which the salt was stored in lofts. A railway was laid down within the works, to carry coal to and salt from such places as could not be reached by water, and a wagon factory, a foundry, fitting shops, sawmills, and a brickyard were established. As many as seven depots were established in London. Corbett himself supervised all details. Within twenty-five years he raised the annual output of salt from 26,000 tons to 200,000 tons, and built up the most perfect system of salt manufacture in the world. Corbett enjoyed excellent relations with his workpeople. He built model houses, gardens, schools, a club house, lecture room, and dispensary. In 1859 he abolished female labour at the works, and in order that the family incomes should not suffer, increased the men's rates of pay, an act of generosity commemorated by a window placed by public subscription in Stoke Prior church. He sold the works in 1889 to the Salt Union.<br>
<br>Corbett was interested in politics on the Liberal side. In 1868 he contested Droitwich unsuccessfully against the Conservative candidate, Sir John Pakington, but the voters reversed their decision in 1874, when Corbett defeated Pakington and was elected. He kept the seat in 1880; in 1885, when the old borough was merged in the mid-Worcestershire division, he was returned unopposed for that constituency. In the Commons, though never prominent in debate, he showed interest in questions of local taxation, advocated alterations in the laws of land tenure, and was an early advocate of women's suffrage. Opposed to Irish home rule, he joined the ranks of the Liberal Unionists in 1886 and was returned by a large majority in that interest in July 1886. He retired at the dissolution of 1892.<br>
<br>Corbett acquired from Lord Somers a large estate at Impney near Droitwich and from Athelston Corbet (not a relative) a second estate at Ynysmaengwyn near Tywyn in Merioneth. On the Impney property he erected a residence in the style of a French ch&acirc;teau of the time of Fran&ccedil;ois I. Having an interest in transport systems, he was a director of various canal companies and of the River Severn Navigation. He was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1876. A generous supporter of philanthropic institutions in the midlands, Corbett presented land and buildings for Corbett Hospital to Stourbridge in 1892 and Salters' Hall, a building capable of holding 1500 people, to Droitwich. He also contributed generously to the funds of Birmingham University, of which he was a governor, to the University College of Wales, and to the Bromsgrove Cottage Hospital; he helped in the development of Droitwich as a health resort by the erection of St Andrew's Brine Baths (1889), and by the restoration of the old Raven Hotel and the building of the Worcester Hotel; he presented a church clock to Brierley Hill and placed memorial windows in the church there to his father and mother. To the development of Tywyn he contributed by the erection of a fine esplanade, a massive sea wall, and the provision of water and sewage systems. Corbett died at Impney on 22 April 1901.<br>
