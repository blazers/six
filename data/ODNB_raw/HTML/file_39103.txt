<span class="headword">Wulfric of Haselbury</span> <span class="st"> [St Wulfric of Haselbury]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1090&#150;1154/5), <span class="occ">priest and hermit</span>, spent much of his life enclosed in a cell at Haselbury Plucknett (Somerset), where he lived a life of great austerity and received many visitors, including kings and queens.<br>
<br>Perhaps <i>c</i>.1090, Wulfric was born to English parents of middling social rank at Compton Martin (Somerset), a village some 9 miles from Bristol, the lord of which was William FitzWalter. Having been ordained priest, Wulfric first ministered at Deverill, near Warminster (Wiltshire), where he led a worldly life and spent much time in hunting and hawking, until a chance encounter with a beggar converted him to a stricter life. William FitzWalter thereafter recalled him to be parish priest at Compton Martin. After a few years there, about 1125 William enabled him to settle as an anchorite at the parish church of Haselbury Plucknett, a village of which he was also lord, some 28 miles to the south. For the rest of his life, Wulfric occupied a cell on the north side of the chancel; he had a servant to attend to his needs. He was not the parish priest, but for the most part he co-operated amicably with the married clerk, Brictric, who had cure of souls.<br>
<br>Wulfric was not inducted into his cell, as would have been customary, by the bishop of Bath, then Godfrey; but he obeyed the directions of Godfrey's successor, Robert. He maintained close touch with the nearby Cluniac priory at Montacute which daily supplied him with food. Spiritually, he held the Cistercians in high regard and he especially revered the community at Ford in the east of Devon (now in Dorset); but he was not well disposed towards the Augustinian canons. His own way of life was rigorously austere. He wore a hair shirt which he soon covered with a hauberk of chain mail supplied by William FitzWalter. He undertook prolonged vigils and fasts, and he frequently immersed himself in cold water. He engaged in bookbinding and oversaw the making of church vestments.<br>
<br>Wulfric became famous for his miracles and gift of prophecy. Unlike Brictric, he was almost certainly bilingual in English and French. His most interesting contacts were with Anglo-Norman royalty. A courtier of Henry I, Drogo de Munci, was stricken with fits for suggesting the seizure of money from Wulfric's cell; a visit by Henry and his queen, Adeliza, led to Wulfric's healing of Drogo. Wulfric later prophesied that Henry's crossing of the English Channel in 1133 would be the last that he would make alive; upon learning in 1135 that this had come true, Wulfric declared that Henry would find mercy with the Lord, &#145;because in his life he had striven for peace and justice, and had built the Lord's house at Reading [Reading Abbey] with regal magnificence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wulfric of Haselbury</span>, ed. M. Bell, 116&#150;17). Before Stephen succeeded, he and his brother Henry, bishop of Winchester, visited Wulfric, who prophetically hailed Stephen as king. Wulfric also foretold the disturbances that would follow a divided succession, including Stephen's captivity at Lincoln in 1141. Later in his reign, Stephen visited Wulfric, who reproved him but promised that he would reign for as long as he lived. He also censured the haughtiness of Stephen's queen, Matilda, who had snubbed at court William FitzWalter's wife. Wulfric charged the future Henry II 12<i>s</i>. for his followers' depredations at his cell and foretold that Henry would not reign during Stephen's natural life. Another prophecy was of the failure of the second crusade.<br>
<br>Wulfric died on 20 February, probably in 1154 but possibly in 1155; the monks of Montacute and Ford contended for his body, but Robert, bishop of Bath, insisted upon his wish to be buried in his cell. His body was soon twice translated to places in the chancel of the church. His cult developed somewhat slowly, but throughout the latter middle ages Haselbury became a place of pilgrimage. Henry of Huntingdon was the first chronicler to refer to Wulfric, but practically all that is known about him comes from a life written <i>c</i>.1184 by John, prior and later abbot of Ford. Wulfric's career illustrates how, when Englishmen were largely debarred from normal ecclesiastical promotion, the eremitical life could offer a way to spiritual authority with both the French and the English.<br>
