<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thynne,  Henry Frederick</span>, sixth marquess of Bath  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">landowner and businessman</span>, was born in the great Elizabethan house of Longleat, Wiltshire, on 26 January 1905, the second son and youngest of five children of Thomas Henry Thynne, fifth marquess of Bath (1862&#150;1946), and his wife, Violet Caroline (1869&#150;1928), putative daughter of Sir Charles Mordaunt, tenth baronet, and his first wife, Harriet Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moncreiffe. His childhood was spent principally at Longleat, where the fifth marquess lived in high pomp even after the First World War, keeping twenty indoor servants, the footmen kitted out in silk stockings and cocked hats. On the death of his elder brother on the western front on 13 February 1916, Henry Thynne became Viscount Weymouth and heir to the massive Longleat estate. &#145;How can I look after you?&#146;, he asked the great south front of the house upon hearing the news of his inheritance, &#145;I'll never be able to do it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 1 July 1992).<br>
<br>As Viscount Weymouth, Thynne was given a traditional upper-class education at Harrow School and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied agriculture. At Oxford he formed part of an odd intersection between the horsey and the arty sets, joining the &#145;bright young people&#146; and befriending extreme aesthetes such as Brian Howard, the model for Anthony Blanche in Evelyn Waugh's <span class="italic">Brideshead Revisited</span>. As a result of their friendship Howard uncharacteristically took up riding and designed colours for Weymouth: four yellow hearts on a black background. Through Howard, Weymouth met Daphne Winifred Louise Vivian [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68822/', "Fielding, Daphne (1904&#150;1997)")</script>], only daughter of George Crespigny Brabazon Vivian, fourth Baron Vivian, and his first wife, Barbara, daughter of William Atonar Fanning. Facing parental opposition, they married privately at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, under the names of Frederick Thynne and Winifred Vivian, on 8 October 1926. Weymouth then left for America with his friend and future brother-in-law Lord Nunburnholme. After an eventful period working on a Texas ranch and exploring Latin America, Weymouth returned to announce his engagement to Daphne Vivian in May 1927; the couple were married publicly at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 27 October 1927.<br>
<br>Weymouth buckled down to the responsibilities of Longleat, the management of which he took over in 1928. After some further training with the agent of Lockinge Park (owned by relatives of Daphne's), he set about vigorously modernizing and professionalizing the estate. Unnecessary staff were laid off and commercial forestry was undertaken. Weymouth also had the foresighted idea of developing the tourist potential of the caves at Cheddar Gorge, for which he had an unusually modernistic restaurant and museum designed by the landscape architects Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page. He left alone for the time being the big house, where his father continued to reside. Instead he and Daphne lived in more modest houses on the estate, where they could keep up a bohemian lifestyle and friendships with the likes of Cecil Beaton and Robert Byron. They had five children: (Thomas) Timothy (1929&#150;1930), Alexander George (<i>b</i>. 1932), Christopher John (<i>b</i>. 1934), Valentine Charles (1937&#150;1979), and Caroline Jane (1928&#150;1995). At his father's insistence Weymouth also took on the Conservative candidacy for Frome in 1931 and he served reluctantly as its MP until 1935, but his heart was in land management and the good life, not in politics.<br>
<br>The Second World War disrupted this idyllic existence. Weymouth joined the Royal Wiltshire yeomanry. He was wounded at the battle of El Alamein, taking a piece of shrapnel in the throat, &#145;when I was walking about the battlefield on my own &hellip; I was bored&#151;I had lost my tank and I had nothing to do&#146;  (Longleat MSS). It was not, as one obituary had it, while leading the Moonrakers tank charge at Tel-el-Aquaquoir, which he missed entirely. Weymouth was invalided home and an old shooting friend, General Pete Corlett, invented a position for him as British liaison officer to the American 19th corps, posted near Longleat. Weymouth's exploits with the 19th corps after D-day earned him bronze and silver stars from the Americans.<br>
<br>Shortly after the war's end, on 9 June 1946, the fifth marquess of Bath died. Although he had long before handed over to Weymouth the Longleat estate, hoping to escape death duties, he had retained too much capital for too long and the sixth marquess was faced with a bill of &pound;700,000. To pay this he sold 5400 of his 16,000 acres. Almost as daunting as death duties was the great house, then occupied by an evacuated girls' school. To cover its running costs, estimated at &pound;30,000 per annum, Bath thought first of converting it into a luxury hotel, but then decided to open it to the public on a commercial basis, inspired by his success at Cheddar. Apart from Warwick Castle, there was no precedent for mounting a commercial tourist operation at a stately home and in conditions of post-war austerity the venture was a considerable risk. The Baths approached the project with their customary flair, paving estate roads for what they hoped would be a flood of traffic, opening a caf&eacute; in the basement, and courting all the publicity they could get. They opened for business on 1 April 1949. To the world's amazement Longleat drew 135,000 visitors in that first year and a new tourist industry took off on its example. Bath soon had the whole estate on a sound economic footing; he also continued in commercial forestry and again called in Russell Page, this time to develop the gardens around the house.<br>
<br>The Baths' marriage had suffered badly from their wartime separation and their joint venture with the house did not serve to repair the damage. The marriage was dissolved in May 1953 and both parties remarried almost immediately. Daphne married the writer Xan Fielding, Henry (on 15 July 1953) married Virginia Penelope Tennant (<i>b</i>. 1917), daughter of Alan Leonard Romaine Parsons and his wife, Viola, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tree, and formerly the wife of the Hon. David Tennant. Soon after their remarriages the publication of Daphne's memoir <span class="italic">Mercury Presides</span> (1954) revealed the secret of the private wedding, which had not been annulled; it took an appeal to the High Court to get the annulment extended, in 1955. &#145;Darling&#146;, remarked Osbert Lancaster's cartoon character Maudie Littlehampton, &#145;do you remember betting me a fiver that it was going to prove a lot easier to unite the Germans than to separate the Baths?&#146; Safely unbigamized, the marquess and his new marchioness then had a daughter, Silvy Cerne (<i>b</i>. 1958).<br>
<br>As the stately home business expanded, Bath remained constantly alive to the need to keep his own pioneering operation competitive. He had put pedalos on the lake as early as 1953, opened a garden centre in 1960, and employed a public relations officer, simply to keep numbers at their initial high levels. He was determined to maintain Longleat as a commercial business independent of government subsidy, scorning grants to historic buildings as &#145;iniquitous&#146; (though he took them eventually to staunch an infestation of death-watch beetle). In 1964 he leapt at a proposal, advanced by the circus impresario Jimmy Chipperfield, for an open-air safari park on the estate. When it was announced that the park would feature a drive-through lion enclosure, the local and national press attacked the &#145;mad Marquess&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span> growling that &#145;cattle, sheep and deer ought to be good enough for a Wiltshireman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Sept 1965). But the opening of the joint venture in April 1966 was a popular triumph, and, boosted further by a new exhibition of Churchilliana in the house, tourist numbers jumped to 300,000 for the house and 100,000 for the safari park. Other gimmicks followed: kitchens with waxwork servants, television tie-ins, and teddy bear rallies.<br>
<br>Somewhat grudgingly, Bath had already handed over management of the bulk of the estate to his heir, Alexander, Viscount Weymouth, having taken care to convey legal ownership as early as 1958, with death duties keenly in mind. As he aged, edging out of the limelight that he had so much enjoyed, Bath devoted himself more to building up his personal collections, which included children's books and items associated with Churchill, Edward VIII, Margaret Thatcher, and, controversially, Hitler. Much criticism had attached to him for his purchase of two Hitler watercolours at auction in 1960. More came when he confessed to admiring the man. Ultimately he built up the world's largest collection of Hitler paintings, garnished with other ghoulish Nazi memorabilia. A huge sale of books netting over &pound;300,000 in 1979 cleared remaining debts, and under his son's management, and with land values soaring, the estate was riding high. He died at Crockerton, Wiltshire, on 30 June 1992, and his ashes were buried in the family vault at Longbridge Deverill church. By the time of his death the sixth marquess had answered triumphantly his youthful question to the great house, &#145;How can I look after you?&#146;<br>
