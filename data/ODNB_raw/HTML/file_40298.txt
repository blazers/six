<span class="headword">Cormack,  John</span>  (1894&#150;1978), <span class="occ">protestant agitator and local politician</span>, was born on 7 July 1894 in Edinburgh, the eldest child of the four sons and three daughters of Donald Cormack (1865&#150;1937), a clerk and former soldier, and his wife, Mary McPhail (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;1951). The family moved to Liverpool for a time but returned to Edinburgh, where Cormack had an elementary school education. He enlisted in 1909 as a boy soldier, serving in his father's regiment, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.<br>
<br>Cormack remained for thirteen years in the army, survived First World War service in France, and was in the Rhineland army of occupation, and then in Ireland during the Anglo-Irish war (the &#145;troubles&#146;). In October 1918 he married Mary Ross&#151;they had three daughters and a son, but the marriage broke up in the early 1930s&#151;and took his discharge as corporal in 1922. He probably held higher acting rank earlier and was also a drum major. He returned to Edinburgh, where he worked as a Post Office sorter and driver for ten years until suspended after allegations (which he said were malicious) of stealing postal orders. No charges followed and wrangling ensued, but he lost his job.<br>
<br>Cormack's leisure activities made him a controversial figure. His father was a Baptist whose lay preaching included meetings on the Mound, then Edinburgh's speakers' corner. Although the emphasis was evangelical there were occasional confrontations with Roman Catholics, whose controversialists also pitched their pulpits there. John Cormack developed his own militancy, joining the fringe of a widespread Scottish protestant movement in which new anxieties were grafted on to the traditional doctrinally based hostility to the Roman church. One of these was demographic alarm at Irish immigration, another dislike of the 1918 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> by which the state assumed responsibility for Catholic education but allowed the hierarchy considerable influence. But closest to Cormack's experience was resentment at the perceived alliance of the Roman church and Sinn F&eacute;in which he had witnessed in the Irish troubles. The Argylls, whose turbulent beat included the Knock pilgrimage, resented the hostility they faced from priests and seminary students.<br>
<br>Cormack developed a taste for historical and theological polemic, enlivened with denunciations of priestly delinquencies. He joined the Scottish Protestant League, a vehicle for protest driven by the unstable Alexander Ratcliffe, but seceded in 1930. In 1933 he was co-founder of the Protestant Action Society, and joined an Orange lodge, though he was intermittently at odds with that movement. Cormack combined leadership and &#145;loner&#146; qualities. He deployed effective techniques of oratory and demagoguery, adaptable to indoor or outdoor use and displayed on the Mound for thirty years. During the 1930s his meetings provoked confrontation, especially among those who came to be provoked. In 1935 he led protests in Edinburgh against a Roman Catholic young men's conference and a eucharistic congress. These brought tens of thousands to the streets, as protesters and spectators, and involved turbulence, intimidation, and violent clashes. He also used his position on the city council, after his election for North Leith in 1934, to oppose the granting of the freedom of Edinburgh to the Australian prime minister, Joseph Lyons, and the American ambassador Joseph Kennedy, carrying protests from the council chamber to the ceremonies themselves. He campaigned on education and the replacement of Catholic municipal workers by unemployed protestants, though his causes also included slum clearance, nurses' pay, and a civic airport.<br>
<br>It was remarkable that such protests should flourish not only on Clydeside, with its sectarian traditions, but in Edinburgh, where the Roman Catholic minority represented only 9 per cent of the population and the dominant middle-class protestantism was hostile to all demonstrative militancy. Cormack's success, most evident when Protestant Action took 31 per cent of votes in the Edinburgh local elections in 1936, perhaps reflected an Edinburgh working-class search for a cause of its own, at a time when it was less affected by socialism than most of urban Scotland. It also reflected the economic frustrations and political styles of the 1930s.<br>
<br>But the tide of protestant militancy, also evident in Glasgow, soon ebbed. Ratcliffe's personal cult, which also moved towards antisemitism, decayed rapidly. Cormack lost his council seat in 1937, though he was returned for South Leith in 1938. He remained a councillor (and a phenomenon) until his retirement in 1962. The ill will he provoked in his prime surrounded him into the war years. The Roman Catholic archbishop unsuccessfully urged the Scottish Office to act against him for the alleged incitement by him of attacks on Italian businesses in 1940, a charge of which he was innocent, though he denounced Italian as well as Irish Catholicism and was hostile to Poles, even when they were allies. However, Cormack was insulated from Nazism and fascism, as well as communism and Scottish nationalism. He was not antisemitic, but he sympathized with Jews as victims of the Inquisition. His suspicion that &#145;once a Catholic, always a Catholic&#146; (irritating protestant campaigners working with former monks and disillusioned priests) extended to Hitler and Mussolini.<br>
<br>Cormack failed to become Leith's MP when he stood as an independent candidate at the general election of 1945, coming last with under 2500 votes out of a total poll of over 32,000. Thereafter he mellowed and concentrated on developing the substance and image of robust independence. On Edinburgh corporation he was a one-man party, co-operating with the ruling progressives (Conservatives, Liberals, and right-wing independents, Roman Catholics among them). He became health convener and a bailie, and was also a magistrate, achieving a kind of aldermanic status, though later than his seniority suggested. Militancy, isolation, and perhaps his plebeian origins excluded him in 1950s Edinburgh from the possibility of becoming lord provost. His personal credit was raised by his advocacy of Leith interests and his exemplary fairness on the magistrates' bench, together with a reputation (which his simple lifestyle, in a modest flat, bore out) for eschewing personal advantage. Now a dormant volcano, he became a local worthy. The Catholic historian of protestant protest described his transition &#145;from ogre to institution&#146;  (Gallagher, 159). Heart trouble in 1964 silenced his oratory. He died in Edinburgh on 17 June 1978 and was cremated at Warriston, Edinburgh, on 20 June.<br>
