<span class="headword">Nash,  (William) Heddle</span>  (1894&#150;1961), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 14 June 1894 at 62 Amersham Vale, Greenwich, London, the son of William Nash, master builder, and his wife, Harriet Emma Carr. His father was also a talented singer. After studying at Blackheath Conservatory he served with the 20th London regiment during the First World War in France, Salonika, and Palestine. After the war he got a job singing in the pit for a marionette company giving puppet performances of opera. On 7 April 1923 he married Florence Emily Violet, daughter of Henry James Pearce, a sign manufacturer. Nash subsequently went to Milan to study with Giuseppe Borgatti. He made his d&eacute;but in Milan in 1924, singing Almaviva in Rossini's <span class="italic">The Barber of Seville</span>, and sang in the opera houses of Genoa, Bologna, and Turin, developing an Italianate style of singing that remained with him: it was said of him that he sang everything as though it were by Verdi. He returned to London in 1925, and was engaged by Lilian Baylis to perform with the Old Vic Company, appearing as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's <span class="italic">Rigoletto</span>, Tonio in Donizetti's <span class="italic">The Daughter of the Regiment</span>, and Tamino in Mozart's <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span>. He toured with the British National Opera Company in a number of roles until its collapse in 1929, when he made his d&eacute;but at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, as Don Ottavio in Mozart's <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span>.<br>
<br>As well as singing the leading tenor roles in Italian and French operas at Covent Garden until the Second World War, Nash was also noted for his David in Wagner's <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span>. He sang in the first Glyndebourne season, in 1934, taking the role of Don Basilio in Mozart's <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> at the inaugural performance of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, and Pedrillo in Mozart's <span class="italic">Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail</span>. He also sang Ferrando in Mozart's <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span>, although, as was usual at the time, the company performed a cut version, leaving Nash with only one aria. He sang these three roles every year until 1938, and Don Ottavio in 1937.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Nash toured with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, often singing opposite the Australian soprano Joan Hammond, in roles including Faust in Gounod's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, Pinkerton in Puccini's <span class="italic">Madama Butterfly</span>, and Rodolfo in Puccini's <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span>. After the war he sang Des Grieux in Massenet's <span class="italic">Manon</span> in the first post-war season at Covent Garden (1947&#150;8), and continued to appear on stage until 1957, when he created the minor character Dr Manette in Arthur Benjamin's <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> with the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells.<br>
<br>Heddle Nash was also much in demand as a singer of oratorio. Asked by Elgar to sing the part of Gerontius in <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span> at the Worcester festival in 1932, he sang the part for many years&#151;singing it at every Three Choirs festival from 1934 to 1950; and he appeared with Kathleen Ferrier (who sang the role of the Angel) and Sir John Barbirolli and the Hall&eacute; Orchestra from 1948. He took part in the first complete recording in 1945, with Gladys Ripley as the Angel, conducted by Malcolm Sargent. His song recitals often included songs by Liszt, and Handel arias. Nash performed in some of the recitals of English song given at the Wigmore Hall in May and June 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, with pieces including Edmund Rubbra's &#145;Amoretti&#146;, and settings of sonnets by Edmund Spenser, with the New London Quartet. He made many recordings, the most famous of which was the serenade &#145;A la voix d'un amant fid&egrave;le&#146; from Bizet's <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of Perth</span>, recorded in 1932. His first recording was in Gounod's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1929, and other early recordings include arias from Handel's <span class="italic">Jephtha</span>, recorded in 1931; act <span class="smallcap">IV</span> of Puccini's <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span>, recorded with Beecham in 1935; and Beethoven's <span class="italic">Missa solemnis</span>, live from the Leeds festival in 1937. He sang in the Glyndebourne recordings of <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> in 1934, and <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> in 1935, conducted by Fritz Busch. He also made a famous BBC broadcast in 1938 with Maggie Teyte in excerpts from <span class="italic">Manon</span>.<br>
<br>Nash was the leading British lyric tenor in the period from the late 1920s until the early 1950s. With his sweetness and beauty of tone, the naturalness of his diction, and his charm, he had the power to move his audiences. A cheerful and direct person, he never lost his south London accent, and according to the accompanist Gerald Moore (1899&#150;1987) in his autobiography <span class="italic">Am I Too Loud?</span> (1962), there were as many Heddle stories as there were stories about Beecham. Heddle Nash died on 13 August 1961 in Brook Hospital, Greenwich. He was survived by his wife, Violet, and two sons, one of them the baritone John Heddle Nash.<br>
