<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wolff, Sir  Henry Drummond Charles</span>  (1830&#150;1908), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born on 12 October 1830 in Malta, the only son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29836/', "Revd Joseph Wolff (1795&#150;1862)")</script>, a missionary, and his wife, Lady Georgiana Mary (<i>d</i>. 1859), daughter of Horatio Walpole, seventh earl of Orford. He was apparently named after Henry Drummond (1786&#150;1860), co-founder of the Catholic Apostolic church, and used Drummond in the manner of a surname. He was educated at Rugby School during the headmastership of Dr Tait. &#145;I felt it a great honour&#146;, Wolff remarked in later life, &#145;to have received condign punishment at his hands&#146;  (Wolff, 1.18). He left Rugby in 1846, aged sixteen, to study foreign languages abroad, before being employed in deciphering dispatches at the Foreign Office. In 1853 he married Adeline (1826/7&#150;1916), daughter of Walter Sholto Douglas; they had two sons and a daughter.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsattheForeignOffice"></a>Early years at the Foreign Office</h2>After joining the permanent staff of the Foreign Office in 1849 Wolff enjoyed a remarkably eventful diplomatic career which lasted until 1890, albeit interrupted by several spells in parliament. In 1852 he served as attach&eacute; to the British legation in Florence, but returned to the Foreign Office in the following year. He was employed as private secretary by Lord Malmesbury, the Conservative foreign secretary, in 1858, and in October of that year took a similar position with Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, the colonial secretary. In 1859 he was made CMG, and in June departed for the Ionian Islands to become secretary to Sir Henry Storks, the high commissioner. In this capacity Wolff arranged the transfer of the islands to Greece in 1864, and was created KCMG for his efforts in 1862.<br>
<br>Still a young man at this stage, Wolff had shown a considerable talent for getting on. This may be ascribed partly to his genial temperament and social gifts; he was an entertaining conversationalist and also a shrewd judge of character. During this period Wolff enjoyed a reputation as a man about town who paid much attention to attractive women, including, for example, the sisters of Lord Randolph Churchill. This association was to have important consequences later for his political career. But although a popular figure, he was regarded as slightly too bohemian in the most respectable political circles.<br>
<br>As a result of his work in the Ionian Islands, Wolff enjoyed a pension awarded by the Greek government. He therefore felt free to spend several years pursuing various interests without any definite long-term objective in mind. He engaged in a little journalism (he contributed to <span class="italic">The Owl</span> in 1864&#150;70), made his first political foray as unsuccessful Conservative candidate at Dorchester in 1865, and tried to make some money by proposing a scheme for a channel ferry to the French emperor. He also travelled on the continent, notably to the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.<h2>
<a name="PoliticsandtheEasternquestion"></a>Politics and the Eastern question</h2>A new phase in Wolff's life began in 1874 when he was elected as MP for Christchurch, with the advantage of Lord Malmesbury's influence. This election brought Disraeli to power with a Conservative majority for the first time since 1841. Wolff's knowledge of the Eastern question now stood him in good stead. First, the prime minister asked him to speak in support of the purchase of Suez Canal shares. Then the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 offered a further opportunity for advancement. Under the treaty of San Stefano, Russia attempted to establish a large Bulgarian state at the expense of Turkish territory and, in Disraeli's view, to the detriment of British interests. The foreign secretary, Lord Salisbury, sent Wolff to Paris, Vienna, and Berlin to ascertain the views of the leading statesmen with a view to revising the treaty. Subsequently, when a new state of Eastern Rumelia was created, Wolff was dispatched as the British representative on the international commission which was to draw up its constitution. He enjoyed some success in persuading the Russian government to accept the revised position by April 1879, but his work came to nothing when Eastern Rumelia reunited with the rest of Bulgaria.<br>
<br>In this period Wolff's skills as a mediator were also deployed at home, where he acted as a go-between for Salisbury and Parnell, the Irish nationalist leader. Unusually for a Conservative, Wolff believed that some measure of self-rule for Ireland was unavoidable, and that the Conservatives would win a great political advantage if they secured a settlement along these lines.<br>
<br>However, he felt that his efforts on behalf of the government were not sufficiently recognized, and by 1880 he had acquired a sense of grievance that was to remain with him for years to come. This probably strengthened his penchant for cross-party friendships, and his habit of collaborating with Conservative rebels such as Lord Randolph Churchill. He also faced a difficulty at Christchurch, where his constituents were less than appreciative of his protracted absences abroad; so much so that he yielded to pressure to abandon the constituency in 1880. Wolff required a more compact seat which would not make constant calls on his time. At the election of 1880 he was returned for the two-member constituency of Portsmouth. There he advocated a strong army and navy, abolition of the income tax, and reductions in taxes on items of consumption&#151;a programme nicely calculated to appeal to both tories and Liberals in what was a fairly marginal seat.<h2>
<a name="TheBradlaughaffairandtheFourthParty"></a>The Bradlaugh affair and the &#145;Fourth Party&#146;</h2>Following Gladstone's triumphant return to power in 1880 Wolff rapidly rose to prominence as a result of his role in the Bradlaugh affair. As an atheist Charles Bradlaugh, who had been elected for Northampton, wished to affirm rather than swear the oath on taking his seat as an MP. Despite the fact that the leader of the opposition, Sir Stafford Northcote, accepted the government's proposal to establish a select committee to inquire into the issue, Wolff arose on 5 May 1880 to oppose the plan, somewhat to the displeasure of his own front bench. Subsequently, when Bradlaugh agreed to take the oath after all, Wolff again intervened to object on the grounds that, in view of Bradlaugh's views on religion and the monarchy, the oath would be meaningless if administered to him. Since this point was accepted by the speaker, Bradlaugh was forced to withdraw. In the subsequent debate Lord Randolph Churchill supported Wolff, and in this way the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42040', "Fourth Party")</script> was born.<br>
<br>Wolff's motives in all this were mixed. His interventions were in a sense an expression of his own light-hearted and mischievous attitude to politics, sharpened now by a resentment at being overlooked. Also, as an effective debater with a good grasp of parliamentary procedure, he found it frustrating that his leaders were too flat-footed or too deferential to oppose Gladstone vigorously. He certainly showed his contempt for Northcote, whom he described as &#145;a loathsome creature &hellip; a kind of earthworm&#146;, and one reason for continuing the guerrilla tactics was to drive him out of the leadership of his party in the Commons.<br>
<br>The Fourth Party comprised only Wolff, Churchill, John Gorst, and Arthur Balfour. Wolff and Churchill, who was fifteen years younger, shared a similar irreverent attitude. &#145;Your letters are to me like a glass of the best champagne&#151;exhilarating and stimulating&#146;, declared Churchill  (10 Sept 1889; Churchill, 202&#150;3). That the two men were close friends even their opponents appreciated; Joseph Chamberlain described Wolff as &#145;Lord Randolph's jackal&#146;. Throughout the 1880&#150;85 parliament the Fourth Party held regular dinners to co-ordinate tactics; Wolff invariably entertained his colleagues at the Garrick Club. In the house he was the chief tactician and an indefatigable trouble-maker; during the first four months of 1880 alone he delivered sixty-eight speeches and asked thirty-four questions in the house. Gladstone foolishly played into the hands of the four by his readiness to reply to every question with laborious explanations.<br>
<br>Eventually the success of the Fourth Party in obstructing the government began to undermine Northcote's position, as Wolff desired. Churchill extended the campaign against the leadership by championing the cause of the National Union of Conservative Associations. Wolff joined him in this and became a member of the council of the national union. But his key contribution was to negotiate with Salisbury to reach a compromise during the summer of 1884.<h2>
<a name="PartyorganizationandthePrimroseLeague"></a>Party organization and the Primrose League</h2>It was during 1883&#150;4 that Wolff made what was arguably his most enduring contribution to Conservative politics. He fully shared Churchill's concern about the Conservatives' inability to compete effectively with the Liberals in local constituency organization. Their attempt to rejuvenate the official party organization was never wholly successful. But in 1883, while the struggle over the national union remained unresolved, the idea emerged for what became the Primrose League. On the second anniversary of Disraeli's death (19 April) Wolff was very struck at seeing the whole of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons wearing what was supposed to be his favourite flower, the primrose. On the way home he remarked to Churchill: &#145;This should be turned to account. Why not start a &#147;Primrose League&#148;?&#146;<br>
<br>During the summer Wolff and Churchill discussed the idea and enlisted the support of Sir Algernon Borthwick, the proprietor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. They launched the Primrose League at the Carlton Club in November 1883. They declared that the object of the new organization was to rectify &#145;the failure of Conservative and Constitutional Associations to suit the popular taste or to succeed in joining all classes together for political objects&#146;. It seems to have been Wolff rather than Churchill who ensured that the league would become a popular body rather than another clique. He opened up the membership by recruiting women and insisted on admitting all Christian denominations, including Catholics, who traditionally suffered from the entrenched protestant character of Conservative organizations. Wolff also borrowed freely from such organizations as friendly societies, the Orange lodges, and the freemasons to give the league its distinctive badges, honours, antiquated titles, and ritual.<br>
<br>Although at its formation the league had seemed very much an alternative to the official party, this ceased to be the case after 1884, when the compromise negotiated by Wolff included official recognition for the league by the party leaders. As a result it evolved as a supportive adjunct to the official Conservative organizations and never threatened the control of the parliamentary leadership.<h2>
<a name="WolffEgyptandtheNearEast18851890"></a>Wolff, Egypt, and the Near East, 1885&#150;1890</h2>Once the league had been successfully launched, however, neither Wolff nor Churchill played a major part in its affairs. They were more interested in the Conservative Party's return to office in 1885. Salisbury felt obliged to offer Churchill a cabinet position; but Wolff also expected recognition for his many services to the party. Yet he was not really suited to the tedium of administration, and no ministerial role was to be found for him. Churchill pressed successfully for Wolff to be made a privy councillor, but the prime minister had other things in mind for him. In August 1885 he sent Wolff to Constantinople and Egypt for discussions with the Turkish government about the future of Egypt. This move, later described as &#145;sudden and unexpected&#146;  (Hornik, 606), appears to have been a shrewd one on Salisbury's part. With his knowledge and experience of the region Wolff was bound to be attracted by the offer. Moreover, it had the advantage for Salisbury of interrupting the partnership of Churchill and Wolff. It also meant that Wolff was out of the country when the general election took place in November 1885. His opponents in Portsmouth used his absence to some effect and he lost his seat. There was to be no return to parliament; henceforward Wolff concentrated on his diplomatic career. He did attempt to act as mediator between Salisbury and Churchill during the crisis over the latter's resignation as chancellor in 1886; but the prime minister was content to let him go, and Wolff earned no gratitude from either party.<br>
<br>Although Egypt had been under British occupation since 1882 the position had not been formally recognized. As envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to the sultan, Wolff negotiated a settlement whereby Britain and Turkey would each appoint a commissioner to Egypt to help the khedive's government conduct reforms of the army and the government. Wolff then assumed the role of British high commissioner in Egypt from 1885 to 1887. He was left in place by Gladstone, who recognized his ability to maintain friendly relations with the khedive. By 1887 he had negotiated another convention with the sultan whereby the British would withdraw from Egypt after three years, provided no external or internal threat had arisen. Subsequently Britain would enjoy the right to use force in Egypt either to maintain order or to repel an attack from outside. Owing to French and Russian objections this convention was not ratified by the sultan, but in effect Wolff's work had gained Turkish recognition for the British presence in Egypt.<br>
<br>In July 1887 Wolff returned to England&#151;much to the delight of Sir Wilham White, the ambassador at Constantinople  (Hornik, 623)&#151;but by December he had been appointed to deal with another crucial part of the Eastern question as British minister at Tehran. The idea was that he should monitor Russian influence in northern Persia and try to protect British commercial interests there. His work was recognized by the award of the grand cross of the Bath in 1889. When in that year the shah of Persia visited Britain, Wolff was required to return home to attend on him throughout the tour. Then in August he left on a mission to St Petersburg in an attempt to reach an agreement over the extent of Russian and British influence in Persia. The improvement of Anglo-Russian relations became one of his chief objects. To this end he began discussions on a railway system designed to facilitate Russian communications with the Persian Gulf, and he believed that this prepared the ground for the Anglo-Russian entente of 1907.<h2>
<a name="Illhealthanddeath"></a>Ill health and death</h2>However, Wolff's health had begun to deteriorate. He suffered severely from gout, which compelled him to leave Persia in 1890. After briefly holding a post in Bucharest in 1891 he was transferred to Madrid as British ambassador in 1892. This turned out to be a much more difficult post than anticipated because of the outbreak of war between Spain and the United States. Wolff had to contend with the feeling among the Spanish that Britain did not sufficiently support them in this situation. After nearly nine years in Madrid, Wolff retired in October 1900 at the age of seventy. He took up residence in Brighton, where he died, at 128 King's Road, on 11 October 1908. His widow was granted a civil-list pension the following year, and died at her grace-and-favour apartment at Hampton Court on 31 March 1916.<br>
