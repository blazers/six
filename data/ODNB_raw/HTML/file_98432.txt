<span class="headword">Barnham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bradbridge]</span>,  Alice</span>  (1523&#150;1604), <span class="occ">silkwoman and benefactor</span>, was born on 7 September 1523 at Chichester, Sussex, one of the youngest of the fourteen children of William Bradbridge (<i>d</i>. 1546), a successful and prosperous mercer, and his wife, Alice. Alice Barnham is now known for commissioning one of the earliest family portraits in England, dated 1557, in which she appears alongside her two eldest sons. In addition to the portrait, which provides the sole evidence for Alice's date of birth, further information on her life derives from parishs registers, the records of the Drapers' Company, the court of aldermen, and the court of exchequer, and from a memoir, &#145;The character of Sir Martin Barnham, knight&#146;, written by her grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1489/', "Sir Francis Barnham")</script>, for which she served as a source. Alice's father, who was three times mayor of Chichester, raised his children in a tradition of civic prominence and public service&#151;qualities that would serve Alice well in adult life. Two of her elder brothers achieved prominence in the church: Augustine became chancellor (1560&#150;62) and treasurer (1562&#150;7) of Chichester Cathedral, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3165/', "William Bradbridge")</script> succeeded Augustine as chancellor in 1562 and was elected bishop of Exeter in 1571.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandbusiness"></a>Marriage and business</h2>Alice probably married in 1546 or 1547, with the ceremony most likely taking place in her home parish in Chichester. Her husband was <a name="cosubject_98432"></a><span class="headword">Francis Barnham</span>  (1515/16&#150;1576), a <span class="occ">draper and alderman</span> who made frequent appearances in the London records of the time. In his will (proved in 1546) Alice's father specified a marriage portion of &pound;10, while Alice's grandson recalled that the new couple had a joint total worth of &pound;1000  (Barnham, 265). At the time of Francis Barnham's death in 1576 the couple were realizing rental incomes of &pound;1000 annually from properties purchased in London, Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Dorset, and Wales, and they had a &#145;great personal estate&#146; of moveable goods  (ibid.). The family's house on St Clement's Lane, Eastcheap, once the London residence of the abbot of Stratford Langthorne, featured a stone gate and its own garden. Improvements made in 1568, including a modish projecting window, prompted neighbours to complain (with little success) to the city's aldermen. In Tudor terms theirs were &#145;new&#146; lives; Francis was granted a coat of arms in 1561 and the two oldest Barnham sons achieved country gentility.<br>
<br>Francis Barnham was the son of Steven Barnham, who described himself as a yeoman in his will  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/34, fols. 2&#150;3, proved October 1550). According to Francis's grandson, Steven had been a groom of the privy chamber of Henry VIII but the value of the family's estate had depreciated after his second marriage, which was said to be &#145;merely for love&#146;  (Barnham, 264). Francis was first placed in the royal household but, finding this &#145;a slow way of preferment&#146;  (ibid.), soon left to begin an apprenticeship as a draper, which he completed in November 1541. He was an exporter primarily and developed &#145;a very extraordinary reputation in those foreign parts where he traded&#146;  (ibid.). On 9 July 1550 he was admitted to the Drapers' livery, and in 1554 was made company renter (charged with collecting rents on the Drapers' extensive holdings); thereafter he was elected first warden of the Drapers in 1566&#150;7, and in 1569&#150;70 and 1571&#150;2 served as master. For the company Barnham secured the administration of almshouses founded in Kent by the antiquary and lawyer William Lambarde. He was also a merchant adventurer and, having helped finance the failed search for a north-east passage to China, which succeeded in opening new markets in Muscovy, became a charter member of the Russia Company in 1555.<br>
<br>Barnham's civic career began with a churchwardenship at St Mildred Poultry between 1554 and 1556. By 1558 he was a common councillor (and was active in the project to build the Royal Exchange, contributing &pound;5 in 1566). In 1559&#150;61 and 1572&#150;4 he was governor of the Bridewell (having supported its creation as a workhouse) as well as governor of St Thomas's Hospital (1564&#150;70 and 1574&#150;6, serving as treasurer in 1567&#150;9), alderman of the large and unruly ward of Farringdon Without the Walls from 1568 (switching to Tower ward in 1573), and sheriff of London in 1570&#150;71. Only death prevented his election as lord mayor. For the crown he collected fifteenths in 1558; in 1569 Elizabeth I advised her lieutenants-general that &#145;one Barnham&#146; would bring &pound;1500 to provision troops confronting the northern rebellion. These may have been his own funds. Although he seems to have emerged unscathed from a charge of violating the statute against usury in 1574, it is clear that he&#151;like so many merchants&#151;had a long career as a moneylender. He lent &pound;50 to Philip and Mary in 1558, was owed more than &pound;1400 by Elizabeth in late 1571, and&#151;as was alleged in <i>R. v. Barnham</i>&#151;lent &pound;600 to Sir Walter Waller in 1573.<br>
<br>As a merchant Francis Barnham was prohibited from keeping a shop, and the retail branch of the family's business was evidently headed by his wife. Alice Barnham sold fancy fringes and points to the Drapers' Company in the early 1560s, and seems to have had the status of a professional silkwoman. Silkwork was a popular career for the wives of leading citizens who, like all freemen's wives, were authorized to operate as <i>femmes soles</i>, in which capacity Alice was able to bind her own apprentices, keep her own shop, and was responsible for her own debts. Her stock probably serviced Francis's attempts to disguise large loans as sales of merchandise; she was, for example, directly implicated in the usury charge of 1574. After her husband's death two years later two of his apprentices worked out their terms with her. By not remarrying she protected her freedom of the city and bound at least three more apprentices in her own name, freeing the last when she was in her late seventies. The female monopoly on the silk trade ended about 1570 (according to the Barnhams' contemporary, the historian and topographer William Harrison), making Alice one of the last of the London silkwomen. In 1583 she matched her youngest son, Benedict, with Dorothy Smith (<i>d</i>. 1639), the daughter of the queen's silkman.<h2>
<a name="Afamilyportrait"></a>A family portrait</h2>In addition to the wealth of material available on her business career, Alice Barnham is the principal subject of one of the earliest known English family group portraits, formerly identified as <span class="italic">Lady Ingram and her Two Boys Martin and Steven</span> but now titled <span class="italic">Alice Barnham and her Sons Martin and Steven</span> (1557). The misattribution of Barnham as Lady Ingram derives from a paper tag that was probably tacked to the back of the panel in the 1660s, when members of the Ingram and Barnham families intermarried. However, two original <i>trompe l'oeil</i> inscriptions on the painting&#151;&#145;Martin was born the 26 of March at 9 of the clock before noon in Anno Domini 1548&#146; and &#145;Steven was born the 21 of July on a Sunday at night and 10 of the clock Anno Domini 1549&#146;&#151;identify Alice and Francis Barnham's eldest sons, who were baptized at St Mildred Poultry, London, on 27 March 1548 and 27 July 1549 respectively. A third inscription above the head of the female sitter&#151;&#145;I was born the 7 of September on a Sunday 1523, turned from that I was unto that ye see Anno Domini 1557&#146;&#151;establishes Alice Barnham as the person responsible for commissioning the painting. Until 1998 the portrait hung at Boughton Monchelsea Place, a Kent country house inherited by Sir Francis Barnham in 1613. It was then purchased for the William and Bernadette Berger collection and is now exhibited at the Denver Art Museum, Colorado.<br>
<br>In the portrait Alice's writing box rests on a table cover ornamented with silk ribbons. Like the blackwork lace and trimmings of her costume and those of her sons, these probably represent her own wares. On her left Martin is portrayed holding a popular protestant text, Thomas Sternhold's metrical translation, <span class="italic">The Proverbs of Solomon</span> (1549), which is open to the verse &#145;My son receive ye these my words, the which shall be right wise&#146;. Alice poses as if having just written in response, &#145;That we all may receive the same&#146;. Sir Francis (himself a moderate puritan) described his grandmother as &#145;a constant professor of the true religion&#146; during &#145;those times of persecution&#146;  (Barnham, 265). Between 1553 and 1555 she is known to have taken her children to hear John Bradford preach from prison before his martyrdom.<br>
<br>The painting has been connected on stylistic grounds with Hans Eworth, a Flemish expatriate who kept a studio in Southwark from about 1549. Though it lacks his distinctive HE signature, it has strong affinities with his portrait of Mary Neville, Lady Dacre, of the late 1550s; she is similarly shown in three-quarter view and with quill in hand. Equally the family portrait may have been painted in the Low Countries, if Alice joined her exiled brother William there in 1557. She could have sent the panel back to Francis, who continued to maintain a high civic profile during the Marian years, as evidence of her good stewardship of their sons' health and religious education. The turn of her inscription, &#145;from that I was unto that ye see&#146;, may allude to the spiritual crisis of those years, to the probable death in infancy of her third son, or simply to the years she had lived since her birth (at this date surpassing the age of Jesus at the time of his death).<br>
<br>Francis Barnham died in 1576 aged sixty and was buried on 23 May at the parish church of St Clement Eastcheap. The tomb Alice Barnham commissioned for her husband, on the north side of the choir, was destroyed in the great fire of 1666. In 1592 she placed a brass plaque in Chichester Cathedral that is dedicated to her natal family and reads (in part): &#145;This stone was finished at the charges of the Worshipful Mistress Alice Barnham, widow.&#146; In her widowhood Alice was courted by the grocer Sir Thomas Ramsey, who served as sheriff in 1567 and as lord mayor a decade later. Discovering that Alice had rented jointure properties to her son Martin at below-market rate (so that Martin received the &#145;benefit&#146; of their incomes), Ramsey insisted that she reclaim her leases before finalizing the marriage. &#145;Nay&#146;, replied Alice (in the words of her grandson):<blockquote>be not so hasty, except it be to appoint your wedding day with some other wife, for on me I assure you, you must not reckon. For I shall never think my self happily bestowed upon a husband that setteth so small a value on me as you have done in making this little improvement of my jointure &hellip; a necessary condition of your match with me. But it hath fallen out well and given me two satisfactions, the one of your nature, which is surely so set upon covetousness as would have given me but small comfort in you; the other, that of my son's duty and good affection to me, which made him comply with my desires though to his own prejudice. (Barnham, 269)</blockquote>Refusing Sir Thomas, she restored the leases to Martin.<br>
<br>Alice Barnham died in 1604 and was buried on 14 May. Of her four sons she was survived by Martin, who became high sheriff of Kent in 1598, was knighted in 1603, and died in 1610, and Steven, who became MP for Chichester and died in 1608. A third child, Anthony, probably died soon after his baptism on 18 March 1558, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1488/', "Benedict Barnham")</script>, who died in 1598, amassed one of the great city fortunes of the period and was a benefactor of St Alban Hall, Oxford. In his will Benedict had described Alice as &#145;a most rare and loving mother and a good and just woman&#146;  (Orlin, 57). The Barnhams' grandchildren, Alice (1592&#150;1650) and Elizabeth (1592&#150;1622&times;4), both daughters of Benedict, married Sir Francis Bacon, the philosopher and future lord chancellor, and Mervin Touchet, second earl of Castlehaven, respectively. In her own will Alice left an assortment of charitable bequests, including &pound;5 each to the poorest prisoners at several London gaols, &pound;10 to children at Christ's Hospital, &pound;4 to purchase food for inmates of Bedlam, &pound;20 to impoverished students of divinity at Oxford and Cambridge universities, &pound;120 for young merchants in Chichester, and sums of between &pound;5 and &pound;10 to poor persons in London, Hampshire, and Sussex. Barnham Street in Southwark is named for Francis's bequest to Christ's Hospital, but in his edition of the <span class="italic">Survay of London</span> of 1617 Anthony Munday singled out Alice instead, praising her as one of forty-three &#145;citizens' wives deserving memory for example to posterity&#146;.<br>
