<span class="headword">Dickinson,  Henry Winram</span>  (1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">historian of engineering and technology</span>, was born at Ulverston, Lancashire, on 28 August 1870, the eldest son of John Dickinson, general manager and secretary of the North Lonsdale Iron and Steel Company Ltd, and his wife, Margaret Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winram. From Victoria Grammar School at Ulverston he went to Manchester grammar school with a foundation scholarship. After a two-year engineering course at the University of Manchester, and four years' apprenticeship (1888&#150;92) at the Parkhead steel works of William Beardmore &amp; Co. Ltd, Glasgow, he became a draughtsman at the Glasgow Iron and Steel Company's Wishaw works and then assistant engineer at the Frodingham Iron and Steel Company.<br>
<br>Dickinson's career was settled when he was twenty-five: in 1895 he was appointed by open competition junior assistant in the science department, South Kensington Museum, London, which became the Science Museum in 1909. On 15 June 1897 he married Edith (<i>d</i>. 1937), youngest daughter of Richard Emerson, schoolmaster, of Low Dunsforth, Yorkshire. Their only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40540/', "Henry Douglas Dickinson (1899&#150;1969)")</script>, was later professor of economics at Bristol, 1951&#150;64. Promoted assistant keeper in the machinery division in 1900, Dickinson was, in addition, made secretary to the advisory council in 1914. From 1915 to 1918 he was secretary of the munitions inventions panel at the Ministry of Munitions. On his return to the Science Museum he was promoted in 1924 keeper of mechanical engineering, taking charge of numerous industrial collections, including motive power. He supervised the erection of the original Newcomen type and Watt beam engines and many other historical exhibits in the museum's new eastern block, opened by George V in 1928, and was responsible for the transfer from Handsworth and the arrangement as a museum exhibit of the contents of James Watt's garret workshop.<br>
<br>Dickinson represented the Board of Education in 1919 on the memorial committee to commemorate at Birmingham the centenary of the death of Watt. Resulting from this, Dickinson and other engineers founded in 1920 the Newcomen Society for the Study of the History of Engineering and Technology, named after Thomas Newcomen (<i>d</i>. 1729) of Dartmouth, maker of the first successful steam engine using a piston in a cylinder. Dickinson was honorary secretary until 1951, except for two years (1932&#150;4) when he was president. As sole editor of the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> until 1950, he set a very high standard and the first twenty-five volumes are a lasting memorial of his devoted work. He was made secretary emeritus in 1951 for his very distinguished services in guiding the society for over thirty years, including the critical war period. After he retired from the Science Museum in 1930, his main interest was the Newcomen Society. During his career he presented twenty-three papers to it, and two to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, of which he was a member for over fifty years.<br>
<br>Dickinson was the British government's representative at the opening of the Deutsches Museum, Munich, in 1925; he served as president of the Croydon and Purley natural history and scientific societies, besides being a vice-president of the Cornish Engines Preservation Society. He made two lecture tours in the United States, in 1923 and 1938, and received the honorary degree of EngD from Lehigh University, Pennsylvania. On 31 May 1939 he married his second wife, Elsa Lees, eldest daughter of Frank Walker Burgan, railway traffic agent, of Saltburn by Sea, Yorkshire. He died at his home, 20 St James Road, Purley, Surrey, on 21 February 1952, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Dickinson was the author of definitive books on his favourite subjects: the biographies <span class="italic">Robert Fulton</span> (1913), <span class="italic">John Wilkinson</span> (1914), <span class="italic">James Watt</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Matthew Boulton</span> (1937); the two memorial volumes <span class="italic">James Watt and the Steam Engine</span> (with Rhys Jenkins, 1927) and <span class="italic">Richard Trevithick</span> (with Arthur Titley, 1934); also <span class="italic">A Short History of the Steam Engine</span> (1939). His series of articles in <span class="italic">The Engineer</span> during 1948 was republished after his death as a memorial volume entitled <span class="italic">Water Supply of Greater London</span> (1954).<br>
<br>By his industrious researches and enthusiasm, tempered with sound judgement, Dickinson made a valuable contribution to establishing the history of technology on a firm basis and was one of the leading authorities on the evolution and application of steam power in the industrial revolution. He inspired others by his example and advice to undertake similar research. He lived modestly and was a lucid author and speaker, his knowledge being based on observation, systematic reading, travel, and the material in the Science Museum, for which he wrote several official catalogues. To perpetuate his memory, the Newcomen Society founded in 1954 the Dickinson biennial memorial lecture; the series was inaugurated by Charles Singer, who received the first Dickinson memorial medal. In 1956 the Newcomen Society in North America, inspired by Dr Charles Penrose, senior vice-president, erected a memorial tablet to Dickinson at the Thomas Newcomen Library, West Chester, Pennsylvania.<br>
