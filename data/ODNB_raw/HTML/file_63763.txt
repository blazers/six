<span class="headword">Mac Conmara,  Donnchadh  Ruadh</span>  (1714/15&#150;1810), <span class="occ">Irish-language poet</span>, is of uncertain origins. There are no written sources for his birth and the two accounts which purport to be based on reliable oral tradition show some discrepancies. O'Grady writing in 1853 states that he was &#145;guided by information carefully collected from such of the posterity of our poet as are still living, as well as from others in that part of the county of Waterford where he spent the greater part of his life&#146; and goes on to say that Mac Conmara was born in Cratloe (An Chreatlach in Irish) in co. Clare &#145;in, or shortly after the year 1709&#146;  (Hayes, 3). Of Seaghan Pl&eacute;imeann, or John Fleming, it is said that he had access to a similar type of informant: &#145;he was acquainted not only with some of Donogh's pupils, but also with one of his grandsons, and had many of his facts from living witnesses&#146;  (&Oacute; Flannghaile, viii). Writing in 1881&#150;2, Fleming states that Mac Conmara was born &#145;early in the last century&#146;  (ibid., 1), and he cites, in agreement with O'Grady, Cratloe as place of birth. Fortunately, a contemporary newspaper, the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> (5 November 1810), recorded Mac Conmara's death at the age of ninety-five and, while the caveat as to the reliability of such oral sources as were available to the newspaper must remain, it is not unreasonable to posit 1714 or 1715 as Mac Conmara's date of birth.<br>
<br>O'Grady and Fleming are in agreement that, having been educated first at home, Mac Conmara was sent to Rome in order to study for the priesthood. This would indicate either that his parents, of whom nothing is known, lived in relatively comfortable circumstances, or that his education was sponsored from the outset by some well-off relation or patron. He spent some five years in Rome and was then expelled from whatever college he had been attending for some misdemeanour of which nothing is known. These formative years equipped him for life with a thorough knowledge of Latin, which he demonstrated in the elegy he wrote for fellow poet Tadhg Gaelach &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in in 1795. Donnchadh Ruadh was doubtlessly fluent in Irish from childhood, he acquired English in the course of his education, and it is not unreasonable to assume a knowledge on his part of some other continental languages gained during the course of his travels. &Oacute; Foghludha rejects the opinion of O'Grady and Fleming that Mac Conmara studied in Rome, arguing that the Latinity the poet undoubtedly possessed would have been accessible to him in Ireland (&Oacute; Foghludha, <span class="italic">Donnchadh Ruadh</span>, iii; &Oacute; Foghludha, <span class="italic">Donnchadh Ruadh MacComara</span>, 10). While the reason put forward by &Oacute; Foghludha for his opinion is valid, the unanimous opinion of the earlier commentators is bolstered by a well-established and widespread practice, which lasted up to the end of the eighteenth century, of young Irishmen going abroad to study for the priesthood. In the absence of documentary evidence to the contrary, the traditions of the poet's time spent in Rome must be allowed to stand. &Oacute; Foghludha's attitude to this question may well have been influenced by an understandable desire, when he produced his two editions, to disseminate a certain orthodox and, therefore, simplified view of Gaelic Ireland in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>About 1740 Mac Conmara arrived from the continent and settled in the Decies country in Waterford. The strong scholastic and literary traditions of that district would have been attractive to Mac Conmara, though it cannot be ruled out that his decision to settle there had to do with his determination not to return to his native parts following his fall from grace in Rome. He taught school in various districts of Waterford, first in the parish of Seskinane in either the townland of Ballynaguilkee or of Knockboy under the auspices of fellow poet Uilliam &Oacute; M&oacute;r&aacute;in. O'Grady and Fleming claim that at about this time he married M&aacute;ire N&iacute; &Oacute;g&aacute;in, but &Oacute; Foghludha's dissenting opinion  (&Oacute; Foghludha, <span class="italic">Donnchadh Ruadh MacComara</span>, 13&#150;14) on this matter does not lack cogency. Unhappy with the life of a peripatetic schoolmaster, it seems that Mac Conmara set out for Newfoundland some time after 1745. The voyage across the Atlantic features in his most ambitious poem, entitled <span class="italic">Eachtra Ghiolla an Amar&aacute;in</span>, &#145;The Voyage of the Luckless Fellow&#146;. While it is not possible to state how long he spent in Newfoundland, it is clear that he had returned to Waterford by 1758 when he compiled the Maynooth manuscript M 85 (4 A 11) in which are found autograph copies of three of his poems, including the &#145;Voyage&#146;. In 1764 Mac Conmara, having appealed to and having won the favour of James Ducket, of White's Town, became clerk of the protestant church in Kilmacthomas. He converted to the tenets of that church in order to get the clerkship and composed what must have been to his Catholic fellows a challenging poem that sets down boldly the reasons for his tergiversation. However, as in the case of his relationship with the Catholic church, his reluctance to toe the line had him in disagreement with the authorities in the new denomination, and he returned to Catholicism. In Mac Conmara's latter years he composed a formal poem of repentance, but does not refer at all to his denominational oscillations. It seems that he had married some years prior to 1764, for in his appeal to Ducket in that year, in the form of a poem, he alludes to his inability to provide for his <i>na&iacute;on&aacute;in</i> or &#145;infant children&#146;  (ibid., 14). From approximately 1800 he spent some years teaching the Power family in the parish of Kill in co. Waterford, but eventually retired to the home of his son Donnchadh &Oacute;g, a weaver by trade, in Newtown near Kilmacthomas, where he died on 6 October 1810; he was buried in Newtown.<br>
<br>Mac Conmara will be best remembered for &#145;The Voyage of the Luckless Fellow&#146; which can be classed as belonging to a category of narrative poetry. In these 291 lines a long sea journey is recounted, including a battle at sea, and an interval in the other world where characters from classical and Irish myth and history are encountered. It is worth noting, however, that his song in praise of Ireland, <span class="italic">B&aacute;nchnoic &Eacute;ireann &Oacute;ighe</span>, which he based on an existing song, was probably composed while in Newfoundland, and is one of the best-known songs in the Irish language folk repertoire today. Despite, or, perhaps, because of the fact that he crossed swords with the Catholic church early in life, he had a lasting interest in the affairs of the clergy, which is reflected in what survives of his verse. In the most comprehensive and most acute analysis to date of Jacobite literature in Ireland  (&Oacute; Buachalla, 646&#150;7) a hitherto unpublished satire by Donnchadh Ruadh is singled out for its biting invective in attacking the Catholic clergy of Ireland for seeking a <i>rapprochement</i> with the Hanoverian kings and government. The concentrated and sustained criticism of the political tendencies of the church as found in these ninety-six lines of verse compensates for a certain flaccidity and lack of focus in Mac Conmara's other poems. This piece also foreshadows his willingness to break, if only temporarily, with the Catholic&#150;Jacobite nexus in order to give priority to earning his bread as a protestant clerk through the offices of a protestant but Irish-speaking landowner.<br>
