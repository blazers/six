<span class="headword">Meadows,  (Joseph) Kenny</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1790, <em>d.</em> 1874), <span class="occ">illustrator and caricaturist</span>, was born at Cardigan in south Wales and baptized on 1 November 1790, the son of James Meadows, a retired naval officer. He grew up living simply in a lighthouse; always hungry, he &#145;used to devour [his] food like a ravening wolf&#146;  (Dalziel and Dalziel, 38). His family's slender means prevented him from obtaining much education. Self-taught and learning from the &#145;wishy-washiness&#146; of the likes of Finden's <span class="italic">Book of Beauty</span>  (Linton, 72), he was handicapped by his poor training and sometimes resented it. Like many other black and white artists of his day, Meadows preferred to draw from his imagination rather than from models: &#145;Nature puts me out&#146;, he told the Dalziel brothers  (Dalziel and Dalziel, 41). By 1823 he had moved to London, where that year he collaborated with George Scharf in designing and lithographing the plates for James Robinson Planch&eacute;'s five-part edition illustrating the costume of six of Shakespeare's plays (1823&#150;5). Meadows was one of the first to introduce wood-engraving among English publishers as a means of cheap and popular illustration, and he became a useful, unostentatious workman who supplied many cuts for newspapers, especially Herbert Ingram's <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. The publisher Henry Vizetelly described Meadows as &#145;a slow and not very regular worker&#146;, needing help at first from other artists in drawing landscapes  (Vizetelly, 1.153). Often unoriginal, he none the less sometimes invented epigrammatic and witty images, such as &#145;Peace&#146; represented by a butterfly at the mouth of a cannon (<span class="italic">Punch</span>, February 1844). He dropped his first name for reasons of &#145;professional distinction&#146;  (Spielmann, 447) and was known throughout his career as Kenny Meadows.<br>
<br>Meadows collaborated with Isaac Robert Cruikshank on <span class="italic">The Devil in London</span> (1832), and in the late 1830s he produced portraits of Dickens's characters (<span class="italic">Bell's Life in London</span>, 1838) and twenty-four portrait heads of characters in <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> &#145;from drawings by Miss La Creevy&#146; (6 parts, 1839). <span class="italic">The Heads of the People, or, Portraits of the English</span>, published in 1838&#150;40, to which William Makepeace Thackeray, Douglas Jerrold, Laman Blanchard, and Leigh Hunt contributed letterpress, increased his popularity. The images range from the highest society (&#145;The Young Lord&#146;) to the lowest (&#145;The Farmer's Daughter&#146;), and, while devoid of originality, they sold well and were republished in Paris in 1839 under the title <span class="italic">Les Anglais peints par eux-m&ecirc;mes</span>, running in tandem with Paul Gavarni's superb <span class="italic">Les Fran&ccedil;ais peints par eux-m&ecirc;mes</span>. Thereafter he was much in requisition for portraits; for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> he drew the principal actors in Dickens's amateur theatrical company (22, 29 November 1845) and a memorable &#145;Old Father Christmas&#146;.<br>
<br>The chief ambition of Meadows's life was to produce a complete illustrated Shakespeare. This he accomplished between 1839 and 1843 by designing upwards of 1000 plates for Barry Cornwall's three-volume edition (1843). His wit and graceful fancy here had free rein, and his designs were masterfully cut by W. J. Linton, John Orrin Smith, and his best pupil, Alfred Harral. Some found a few designs eccentric: in the late nineteenth century Graham Everitt complained that Richard III seemed to suffer &#145;from an attack of tetanus instead of an accession of mental terror&#146;  (Everitt, 361). But Meadows's contemporaries praised the work: &#145;almost poetical&#146;, the painter William Powell Frith called the pictures for <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>  (Frith, 2.103). And subsequent commentators in Britain and Germany have judged his Shakespeare plates &#145;astonishing&#146;, &#145;not to be missed&#146;, &#145;the best in the whole of the 19th century&#146;  (Muir, 54&#150;5). So popular was his conception of Falstaff that a bronze statuette modelled after it in Germany sold in large numbers.<br>
<br>Thereafter Meadows's services were eagerly sought as an illustrator of holiday stories and children's books. Among his later productions, Percy Muir singles out the drawings for a nursery classic, Frances Browne's <span class="italic">Granny's Wonderful Chair</span> (1856), as deserving of a &#145;very special place&#146; in book illustration  (Muir, 133), and Everitt calls the wood-engravings for D. W. Jerrold's &#145;Chronicles of Clovernook&#146; &#145;probably the finest designs he ever executed&#146;  (Everitt, 362). Meadows painted a few oil portraits; between 1830 and 1838 he exhibited once at the Royal Academy and on four occasions at the Suffolk Street gallery of the Society of British Artists. It is said that necessity forced him to paint a butcher's wife in order to pay off his bill, and that he added bits of jewellery on the barter system: a brooch for so many ribs of beef, a watch for chops and steaks, and so forth  (Price, 43). In later life Meadows became an accomplished watercolourist.<br>
<br>Meadows associated intimately with the early <span class="italic">Punch</span> circle. His wife, Agnes (<i>bap</i>. 19 Aug 1800), the daughter of the eminent sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12945/', "John Henning")</script>, was &#145;a quiet, thriftful woman&#146;  (Spielmann, 447). Her brother was Archibald S. Henning, who designed the first <span class="italic">Punch</span> cover; Meadows provided the fifth. For the first seven years of <span class="italic">Punch</span>'s existence he supplied unoriginal but competent drawings; his landscapes were often better than his figures, which tended to &#145;puffy faces and straight arms&#146;  (Houfe). R. G. G. Price judged Meadows's best work to be &#145;more delicately fanciful than either [John] Leech's or [Richard] Doyle's&#146;  (Price, 42), but Meadows received little encouragement from Mark Lemon, the editor, perhaps because his humour was more poetic than robustly pointed. When the magazine developed a small stable of house artists Meadows was no longer employed.<br>
<br>Meadows was a genial, if sometimes temperamental, drinking companion. While working on Samuel Carter Hall's <span class="italic">Book of British Ballads</span> (1842), he and the other artists would gather at the Halls' home, The Rosery, Brompton, for &#145;small talk and smaller Marsala&#146; and afterwards repair to a neighbouring tavern for a night-long carouse  (Linton, 74). Despite his slight frame and chronic rheumatism, he was known as Iron Jack for his stamina and capacity to hold his liquor. Among Meadows's many friends were Blanchard, Dickens, John Gilbert, George Hodder (a nephew by marriage), Hunt, Jerrold, Charles and Edwin Landseer, Daniel Maclise, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield, Frank Stone, and Thackeray.<br>
<br>Meadows lived for some years in Cottage Place, Camden Town, and enjoyed afternoon rambles up to Highgate and Hampstead. Constantly in financial difficulties, in June 1864 he was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;80 &#145;in acknowledgment of his merit as an artist, more especially shown by his illustrations of Shakespeare&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He spent &#145;a hale and vigorous&#146; old age  (Heaton), outliving his reputation, as the obituarists noted ruefully. He died at 458 King's Road, Chelsea, on 19 August 1874; five days later he was buried, near his father-in-law, in the St Pancras cemetery at Finchley.<br>
