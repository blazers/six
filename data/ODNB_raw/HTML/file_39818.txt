<span class="headword">P&auml;cht,  Otto Ernst</span>  (1902&#150;1988), <span class="occ">art historian</span>, was born in Vienna, Austria, on 7 September 1902, the elder son (there were no daughters) of David P&auml;cht, a Jewish businessman, and his wife, Josephine Freundlich. He attended the Volkschule and Stadtgymnasium in Vienna and in 1920 proceeded to Vienna University where, with a brief interlude in Berlin, he studied art history and archaeology. He achieved his doctorate in 1925. His first book, devoted to Austrian Gothic panel painting, appeared in 1929. In 1933 he was appointed <i>Privatdozent</i> at the University of Heidelberg, but the Nazi embargo on Jews holding posts in Germany prevented him from taking up the position.<br>
<br>Frustrated and alarmed by the political situation, P&auml;cht paid his first visit to London at the end of 1935 and settled there in 1938. He was invited to undertake a catalogue of illuminated manuscripts (a field new to him) at the British Museum, liaising with Francis Wormald, then assistant keeper in the manuscripts department, who rapidly became a close personal friend. The evacuation of the manuscripts in 1939 ended this scheme and in 1941 he moved to Oxford to begin a similar project at the Bodleian Library. The resulting three-volume catalogue, completed by his pupil Jonathan Alexander, appeared between 1966 and 1973. Specialists in the study of manuscript illumination were rare and the scope of this undertaking left P&auml;cht with a virtually unrivalled expertise. During his two decades in Oxford he published on a wide variety of topics, paying particular attention to English work of the twelfth century, which he viewed within its wider European context. His contribution to the collaborative monograph on the St Albans psalter (1960) is especially significant. During the same period he turned once more to his original fascination with northern painting of the fifteenth century, publishing <span class="italic">The Master of Mary of Burgundy</span> in 1948.<br>
<br>In March 1945 P&auml;cht had been made fellow and lecturer in the history of medieval art at Oriel College, Oxford. In May 1947 he took British citizenship, which he retained for the remainder of his life. He became senior lecturer in the history faculty in 1952 and was advanced to reader in 1962. His subject was not, however, part of the formal syllabus and opportunities for direct teaching even at postgraduate level were disappointingly meagre. In 1963 he decided to accept an invitation to return to Vienna to fill the chair of art history in succession to K. M. Swoboda, thus becoming one of the few refugee scholars from Austria to return to his roots after the war. His work in England was acknowledged by election to the fellowship of the British Academy in 1956 and by the award of the honorary degree of DLitt at Oxford in 1971.<br>
<br>In the 1960s P&auml;cht's energies were directed almost entirely to his university commitments. His students welcomed him as an outstanding teacher and lecturer and he, in turn, was greatly stimulated by their enthusiasm. Fortunately for posterity, his carefully prepared lectures were all preserved in typescript and a series of publications, including <span class="italic">Buchmalerei des Mittelalters</span> in 1984, made their content and his methodology accessible to a wider audience. After his retirement in 1972 he returned to his own research and published extensively up to the time of his death, paying particular attention once more to the problems of northern painting in the fifteenth century. At the same time he was responsible, in collaboration with Dagmar Thoss and Ulrike Jenni, for the appearance of five volumes in the ambitious catalogue of illuminated manuscripts in the &Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna (French in 1974 and 1977, Dutch in 1975, and Flemish in 1983 and 1990). A fellow of the Austrian Academy since 1967, he was awarded the Order of Merit by France in 1982 and became a commander of the order of Arts and Letters in 1984.<br>
<br>Throughout his long career P&auml;cht's circle of scholarly acquaintance was very wide. His attachment to the Bodleian Library brought him readily into contact with the international fraternity of manuscript specialists drawn there by their individual work. He maintained friendships with other members of the academic refugee community, notably colleagues from the Warburg Institute in London. Back in Vienna his many students found his approach inspiring. P&auml;cht was stockily built and bespectacled, with thick dark eyebrows recalling the original colour of his sparse hair. Twenty-five years' residence in England did not entirely rob his speech of the evidence of his German origins.<br>
<br>P&auml;cht married, on 11 January 1940, Jeanne Thalia (<i>d</i>. 1971), the daughter of Constantine A. Michalopulo, import&#150;export merchant; she was an art historical researcher whom he met when she was working as assistant librarian at the Courtauld Institute, London. They had one son, Michael. Otto P&auml;cht died in hospital in Vienna on 17 April 1988. He bequeathed his important personal working library to the Kunsthistorische Gesellschaft in Vienna.<br>
