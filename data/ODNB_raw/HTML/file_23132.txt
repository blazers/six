<span class="headword">Rankin,  Thomas</span>  (1738&#150;1810), <span class="occ">Methodist minister</span>, was born in Dunbar, Haddingtonshire. Taught the &#145;principles of religion&#146; by his parents (details of whom are unknown) and at school, he wandered as an adolescent into the &#145;trifling amusements&#146; of the genteel life, particularly music and dancing  (Rankin, &#145;Life&#146;, 5.136&#150;7). He questioned the innocence of such practices and the security of his own spiritual estate after hearing Methodist preachers and the testimony of Methodists among troops garrisoned in Dunbar. Drawn into the Methodist orbit, Rankin attended class meetings, heard sermons by George Whitefield in Edinburgh while residing there with an uncle, and experienced the spiritual highs and lows that typified an evangelical conversion, culminating in his sense of forgiveness of sin. The ordeal produced a collapse that gave &#145;the appearance of a rapid consumption&#146;. The spiritual ordeal also produced in Rankin aspirations for the ministry, &#145;thoughts of preaching&#146; as he and other Methodists termed it. He entertained taking orders in the Church of Scotland, and sought Whitefield's advice on that possibility. Further schooling proving impractical, Rankin went on business to Charles Town, South Carolina, for an Edinburgh firm. He returned after several months and heard more Whitefield sermons, but gradually moved away from the Calvinistic towards the Wesleyan wing of the Methodist movement.<br>
<br>In 1759 Rankin began ministerial apprenticeship in the Methodist pattern, travelling with Wesley's lay preachers. In the first years of preaching he experienced doubts about his call, feelings of worthlessness, and temptations at the hand of &#145;Satan&#146;, but was sustained in the faith by fatherly counsel from Wesley, the support of brother preachers, and encouragement from pious sisters. Wesley appointed him to the Sussex circuit and in subsequent years to the Sheffield, Devonshire, and Cornwall circuits (1762&#150;4). By 1765, when the printed conference <span class="italic">Minutes</span> first specify appointments, Rankin numbered among the handful of Wesley's assistants and headed the Dales circuit. He continued in that capacity for Epworth, Cornwall, and Sussex circuits. In 1769&#150;70 Wesley had Rankin &#145;accompany him in his tour through the kingdom&#146;  (Rankin, &#145;Life&#146;, 5.181). Thereafter the relations between the two remained close, and when Wesley became concerned about the good order of the infant American movement, he turned to Rankin first for counsel and then as his general assistant for America.<br>
<br>Rankin arrived in June 1773 as tensions between the colonies and Britain were increasing, and came commissioned to replace Francis Asbury and to rectify the discipline among American Methodists. Relations with Asbury proved testy from the start. Rankin's name comes in for regular criticism in Asbury's journal, while Asbury's name appears frequently in Wesley's letters to Rankin. Asbury's resistant attitude, subversive actions, questioning of appointments, and undermining of policy&#151;none of which Asbury tolerated against his own leadership&#151;had some effect on Rankin's modest success and popularity. However, Asbury's judgement that Rankin proved too strict a disciplinarian, too loyal to Britain, and too subservient to Wesley for American Methodism has prevailed.<br>
<br>At issue in the exercise of discipline were Methodism's indigenization, adaptation to a slave-holding colonial culture, and adherence to British Wesleyan practices. Rankin was not the first nor last immigrant to experience difficulty in grasping the subtle changes that American culture had wrought on imported patterns. Rankin convened the first American conference, itinerated across the eastern seaboard, welcomed African Americans into the Methodist movement, presided over countless quarterly meetings, and brought what had been quite centrifugal evangelical impulses into Methodist order. He departed in October of 1777.<br>
<br>Rankin took regular appointments in Britain until 1783 when he retired, but remained an active supernumerary in London until 1795. In 1789 Wesley selected him as one of the few to be ordained for England and he continued preaching until his last illness. He died on 17 May 1810 at North-Green, in Finsbury, London, and was accorded the honour of burial near Wesley at the City Road Chapel.<br>
