<span class="headword">Hardman,  Edward Fitzmaurice Chambr&eacute;</span>  (1898&#150;1988), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born at Fox Rock House, Stillorgan, Rathdown, co. Dublin, on 25 November 1898, the second child and first son of Edward Chambr&eacute; Hardman (1861&#150;1917), a land agent for several landlords in co. Dublin, and his wife, Gertrude Elizabeth Davies (<i>d</i>. 1959). His father was a keen amateur photographer, and Hardman grew up experimenting with his quarter-plate brass and mahogany Lancaster stand camera, processing the exposed glass-plate negatives in the wine cellar and making contact prints in the apple loft.<br>
<br>After schooling at Earlsford House preparatory school, Dublin, and St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, Hardman joined the Indian army in 1917, obtaining a commission as a regular officer in the 2nd battalion of the 8th brigade of Gurkha rifles, stationed at Lansdowne. He stayed in India until 1922, and despite the dusty conditions produced photographs to send home to his mother and sisters; some of the more dramatic images were processed after his return to England, and exhibited years later.<br>
<br>During this time Hardman met his fellow officer Kenneth Burrell, and decided to make photography his profession. Burrell became his business partner, and in 1922 they travelled together to Liverpool, and established the photographic studio Burrell and Hardman, based at 51A Bold Street. Burrell was content to be a sleeping partner in the business, and bowed out completely in the 1930s. The studio attracted many important figures, such as the seventeenth earl of Derby, and academic figures including the town planners Patrick Abercrombie and Charles Reilly. As Burrell and Hardman became the fashionable choice for portrait photography in Liverpool, Hardman gained commissions from the Playhouse Theatre to photograph the up-and-coming stars of the time. Ivor Novello, Robert Donat, Michael Redgrave, and Patricia Routledge are some of the more famous sitters. In 1923 Hardman joined the Sandon Studios Society, the social focus of Liverpool's artists. He numbered the popular portrait painter Henry Carr, the sculptor Herbert Tyson Smith, and the architect Francis Xavier Velarde among his friends.<br>
<br>On 10 August 1932 Hardman married (Ethel) Margaret Mills (1909&#150;1970), daughter of Albert Mills, an accountant. A photographer in her own right, she had started work as an assistant at the studio in 1926 and played a vital role in the business. When asked about her contribution Hardman answered simply, &#145;I could not have done it without her&#146;  (Hagerty, &#145;Continuity&#146;, 13). They had no children.<br>
<br>By 1938 the business was thriving and a second studio was opened on St Werburgh Street, Chester. Demand rose even further during the war, when portrait photography was a reserved occupation. Countless young men sought a photograph for their families and sweethearts before leaving for the war. In 1948 the Hardmans moved the studio to 59 Rodney Street. It was here that Hardman printed some of his best known work, including <span class="italic">The Birth of the Ark Royal</span> (1950).<br>
<br>Although Hardman worked as a portrait photographer for most of his life, it was his landscape photography that earned him greatest respect among the photographic community. During the 1920s he travelled in Europe, and some of his most acclaimed photographs date from this time, including <span class="italic">A Memory of Avignon</span> (1926). He was a regular exhibitor at the London Salon of Photography, where he received several awards. He later became a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and of the Institute of British Photographers.<br>
<br>Hardman adopted a &#145;pictorialist&#146; approach to his work, whether portrait, building, or landscape. He would carefully compose his subject, making the best use of light and arrangement, but would often also improve the image back in the darkroom; &#145;I have no hesitation&#146;, he once wrote, &#145;in using any means of control, at any stage, which will help to give me the result I want, providing that such control does not conflict with the photographic character of the image&#146;  (Hardman, &#145;Exhibition quality&#146;, 230). Alongside images of the countryside Hardman took many photographs of Liverpool, which document the changing face of the city over more than sixty years.<br>
<br>As home photography became more affordable, and studio photography less fashionable, the portrait business began to slow. In 1958 Hardman decided not to renew the lease on the Chester studio, and in 1966 he officially retired as a professional photographer. When Margaret died in 1970 his world fell apart. Although he continued to take photographs and exhibit his pictures, he had never been a self-publicist, and thus he faded from public view. He died at Sefton General Hospital, Sefton Park, Liverpool, on 2 April 1988, and was cremated on 11 April at Liverpool crematorium.<br>
<br>Just before Hardman's death a trust was established to ensure the long-term protection of his vast collection of photographs. This trust worked with the collection for more than ten years, holding a hugely successful exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in 1994. In order to continue this important work and preserve the collection the National Trust became involved, and in 2004 Hardman's former home and studio, 59 Rodney Street, opened to the public; the photographic collection was kept at Liverpool Record Office.<br>
