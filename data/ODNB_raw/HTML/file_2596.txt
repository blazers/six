<span class="headword">Blakiston,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1603, <em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was baptized on 21 August 1603 at Sedgefield in co. Durham, the third son of Marmaduke Blakiston (1565&#150;1639) and Margaret James (1575&#150;1636). He was apprenticed to Christopher Shafto of Newcastle upon Tyne, probably in 1613, and became a free burgess, as a mercer, in 1627. Later, royalists described him as either a pedlar, butcher, chandler, or shopkeeper, but such disparaging comments cannot detract from the fact that by 1632 he was one of Newcastle's chamberlains. His growing prominence within the town's mercantile community was perhaps assisted by his marriage to Susanna Chamber (<i>b</i>. 1607, <i>d</i>. in or after 1661), the widow of a local merchant, at All Saints, Newcastle, on 9 November 1626. Blakiston's father was a prebendary of Durham Cathedral and a noted Arminian ally of John Cosin, his son-in-law, who was much criticized by puritan commentators such as Peter Smart. However, Blakiston himself emerged as a puritan during the 1630s. He helped secure a lecturer (William Morton) for Newcastle, and was fined by the high commission in Durham for his attack upon a local minister, Yeldard Alvey.<br>
<br>Blakiston was returned to the Long Parliament for Newcastle in a contested election, being declared eligible to sit on 30 January 1641. He became a zealous reforming member and later parliamentarian, who subscribed &pound;1200 for the Irish Adventure, and whose interests lay in religious reform and local affairs, both because of the royalist threat in the north, and because of the involvement of the Scots in later years. He was styled an &#145;Annabaptisticall&#146; sectary by royalist commentators  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, 21&#150;8 Nov 1648, sig. Bbb3<i>v</i>), but he seems rather to have been a more moderate puritan whose friends included Independents such as Sidrach Simpson, and presbyterians such as Robert Jenison, and who was prepared to act as a commissioner for scandalous offences and for exclusion from the sacrament in the mid-1640s. Blakiston's deep religious convictions underpinned his attempt to establish a godly ministry in Newcastle, and his attempt to secure a place for Hezekiah Woodward as one of the town's schoolmasters.<br>
<br>During the course of the civil wars Blakiston emerged as an immensely powerful figure among northern parliamentarians, and was made mayor of Newcastle in October 1645. In July 1646 he was named as a commissioner for conserving the peace between England and Scotland. He, along with Sir Arthur Hesilrige, came to dominate political affairs in the region. Once parliamentarian unity disappeared in the mid-1640s Blakiston emerged as a supporter of the Independents, not least in his opposition to the Scots. Denzil Holles called him an &#145;incendiary&#146; between the two kingdoms, and one of the Independents' &#145;little Northern Beagles&#146; who were set to work to provoke a confrontation between the covenanters and the New Model Army  (Maseres, 1.227, 228). In the north he was aligned with Hesilrige against the interest of Robert Lilburne, causing some acrimony, not least over claims that Blakiston made undue personal gains during the wars and acted to protect local delinquents, including members of his own family. However, the civic leaders in Newcastle defended him against the &#145;unjust and scandalous reflections&#146; made by Lilburne, and remarked on his &#145;sincerity&#146; and &#145;faithfulness&#146;, and upon &#145;how unapt he is to cram himself with the riches of a ruined country&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 56, fol. 22). At Westminster Blakiston became aligned with the more radical elements in the Commons, and his closest allies were probably Thomas Scot and Sir Henry Vane junior. There is also evidence of a close personal friendship with Philip, Lord Wharton. Blakiston joined those MPs who fled to the safety of the army in the summer of 1647, and was later styled one of the &#145;Levelling sort&#146;, who apparently supported the Levellers' &#145;large petition&#146; of September 1648  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, 22&#150;9 Aug 1648, sig. Cc4). Having indicated his opposition to further negotiations with the king in December 1648, Blakiston was named to the high court of justice for the trial of Charles I in January 1649, and proved to be one of the most assiduous of the commissioners, attending all but one session in the painted chamber and all four days of the trial, before signing the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Although probably a zealous supporter of the constitutional changes of 1649, Blakiston was not named to the council of state, but he was an active member of the Rump Parliament until his death, which occurred some time between 1 June 1649, when he drew up his will, and 6 June, when the Commons awarded &pound;3000 to his widow and children.<br>
