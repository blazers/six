<span class="headword">Marechera,  Dambudzo</span>  (1952&#150;1987), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 4 June 1952 in Vengere township, Rusape, in the eastern part of Southern Rhodesia, the third child of Isaac Marechera (<i>d</i>. 1966), truck driver and later mortuary attendant, and his wife, Masvotwa Venezia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nyamaropa, a housemaid and nanny for white children. His name, Dambudzo, meaning &#145;sorrow&#146; or &#145;trouble&#146; in his mother tongue, Shona, expressed the poverty and distress into which he was born; at the same time it anticipated his fame as a troublemaker. Baptized Charles William by the Anglican church, he readopted his Shona name when he started writing. After his father was killed in a road accident the family had to move to a slum. For the hypersensitive and intelligent child the experience of destitution and violence&#151;his mother allegedly resorted to prostitution to feed and educate her nine children&#151;became an early impulse to escape into the world of books. He found his first reading treasures, such as Arthur Mee's <span class="italic">Children's Encyclopedia</span>, in the nearby rubbish dump serving the white community.<br>
<br>From 1958 to 1965 Marechera attended primary school in Vengere. His excellent performance was not diminished by his strong stammer, which people considered a symptom of his intelligence. From 1966 to 1971 he attended one of the first and most prestigious schools for black Rhodesians, the Anglican St Augustine's School at Penhalonga, not far from Rusape. Recognizing his brilliance, his teachers gave him free access to their personal libraries. While devouring literature from all over the world, he started to write his own poems and stories. His decision to become a writer was made when he read his first novel by an African writer, Ngugi wa Thiongo's <span class="italic">Weep Not Child</span>. During his years at St Augustine's his behaviour became increasingly eccentric, provoking clashes with fellow pupils and staff. Shortly before his A-levels he started to &#145;hear voices&#146; harassing him, for which he received medication from a nearby hospital.<br>
<br>In 1972 Marechera enrolled as an English honours student at the University of Rhodesia in Salisbury. At lectures and writing clubs he stunned others with his learning and extraordinary poetic imagination. T. S. Eliot, Samuel Beckett, William Blake, and D. H. Lawrence were his major literary inspirations. During massive student protests in July 1973 against the white settler regime under Ian Smith, Marechera was among the more than 150 students expelled from the university.<br>
<br>In October 1974 Marechera obtained a scholarship to study English literature at New College, Oxford. He felt utterly estranged in British academia and began drinking heavily; his violently destructive behaviour led to his expulsion in March 1976. Insisting that he was not insane, he declined psychiatric treatment offered to him by the college and henceforth chose the lonesome life of a writer without fixed abode. Out of the deep crisis after his expulsion he wrote his first book, <span class="italic">The House of Hunger</span> (1978), a novella and eight short stories, which was enthusiastically accepted for publication by James Currey at Heinemann. &#145;The book is an explosion&#146;, wrote Doris Lessing in her review  (&#145;A cultural tug-of-war&#146;, <span class="italic">Books and Bookmen</span>, 24/9, 1979, 62), and Angela Carter found &#145;a terrible beauty &hellip; born out of the urgency of his vision&#146;  (&#145;A witness, a prophet&#146;, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 21 June 1979). Together with the Irish writer Neil Jordan Marechera won the Guardian fiction award of 1979. During the prestigious award ceremony in the Theatre Royal, he threw china and chairs at chandeliers and London's literati, thus setting his mark as an <i>enfant terrible</i>.<br>
<br>After the success of <span class="italic">The House of Hunger</span> Heinemann urged Marechera to write a &#145;proper&#146; novel. Living in London squatter communities he spent 1979 writing several versions of what was eventually published as <span class="italic">Black Sunlight</span> (1980). Apart from a short stint as a writer in residence at the University of Sheffield and a glorious appearance at the Horizonte festival in West Berlin in 1979 Marechera led an unstable life as a writer&#150;tramp. A notorious drinker and heckler at London's Africa Centre, from where he was also eventually evicted, he wrote articles for <span class="italic">West Africa</span> magazine.<br>
<br>In February 1982 Marechera returned to independent Zimbabwe in order to participate in a television film directed by Chris Austin based on <span class="italic">The House of Hunger</span>. After a quarrel with Austin the film was completed without Marechera as the protagonist. He soon became known as a relentless and outspoken critic of post-colonial politics and society. His third book, <span class="italic">Mindblast, or, The Definitive Buddy</span> (1984), a collection of plays, prose, poetry, and a diary, became the manifesto of his satiric indictment. After two years of homelessness he found a small flat near the centre of Harare, largely depending on friends for his survival. On 18 August 1987 he died of an AIDS-related pneumonia and was buried in Warren Hill cemetery near Harare. He left behind several unpublished manuscripts, some of which were subsequently published by the Dambudzo Marechera Trust, founded in 1988: <span class="italic">The Black Insider</span> (1990), <span class="italic">Cemetery of Mind: Collected Poems</span> (1992), and <span class="italic">Scrapiron Blues</span> (1994). While many of his nationalist contemporaries dismissed him as &eacute;litist and &#145;un-African&#146;, Marechera's outspoken spirit and ground-breaking literary style became an inspiration for later generations of African writers.<br>
