<span class="headword">Wallace,  William Francis Stuart</span>  (1860&#150;1940), <span class="occ">composer and writer on music</span>, was born at 62 Regent Street, Greenock, on 3 July 1860, the first son of James Wallace (1826&#150;1904), a prominent Scottish physician and surgeon, and his wife, Mary Cecilia Williamson. Educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh, he won a trustees' exhibition to Edinburgh University. This he later resigned, and he entered Glasgow University where he graduated MB and MCh in 1886. In Vienna, Paris, and Moorfields he studied ophthalmology before returning to Glasgow to take his MD in 1888. He practised medicine briefly in London, but his attraction to music led him to terminate his medical career in 1889 when he studied for two terms under A. C. Mackenzie and F. W. Davenport at the Royal Academy of Music. The decision to study music served to aggravate a volatile relationship with his father, who was ambitious for his son. His time at the Royal Academy of Music constituted his only period of formal training; after that he worked independently.<br>
<br>In the early 1890s Wallace began to produce a series of orchestral and vocal works including the scena <span class="italic">Lord of Darkness</span> (1890), the suite <span class="italic">A Scots Fantasy</span> (1891), <span class="italic">An American Rhapsody</span> (1891), and also <span class="italic">The Lady from the Sea</span> (1892), based on Henrik Ibsen's play. However, it was his first symphonic poem, <span class="italic">The Passing of Beatrice</span> (arguably the first modern British work in the genre), based on canto xxxi from Dante's &#145;Paradiso&#146; in <span class="italic">The Divine Comedy</span>, that made the greatest impression at its first performance at the Crystal Palace on 26 November 1892 under August Manns. With Howard Orsmond Anderton, Wallace assisted Granville Bantock, a fellow Royal Academy of Music student, with the production of the <span class="italic">New Quarterly Musical Review</span> from May 1893 until February 1897. Bantock also did much to promote Wallace's music, first at a concert in London on 15 December 1896, and later at The Tower, New Brighton, where Bantock was musical director. At The Tower not only did Wallace have the opportunity to conduct entire concerts of his own work (particularly in 1898 and 1899) but, as Bantock's rehearsal conductor, he gained much experience from directing the music of other composers.<br>
<br>During a holiday in Hilders, Switzerland, in 1895, he met Ottilie Helen McLaren (1875&#150;1947), daughter of John, Lord McLaren (1831&#150;1910), judge of the court of sessions, MP, and lord advocate. In spite of Ottilie's being fifteen years younger, they fell in love and became engaged. Lord McLaren insisted that Wallace's income as a musician should be no less than &pound;600 a year before he and Ottilie could marry, a condition which prolonged their engagement for nine years. They were finally married on 11 April 1905 in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh. Ottilie studied sculpting in Edinburgh under James Pittendrigh MacGillivray, before working in Paris under Auguste Rodin between 1897 and 1901. Her separation from Wallace provoked a sizeable correspondence between them&#151;Wallace wrote almost daily&#151;which Wallace preserved in a series of small books, covered with white vellum and fastened with coloured ribbon, now preserved in the National Library of Scotland.<br>
<br>For much of his creative life as a composer Wallace remained independent of musical institutions and societies. Later, however, he was a committee member of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music and served as honorary secretary of the Royal Philharmonic Society and the Society of British Musicians in the years before the outbreak of war. During the war he returned to the medical profession, first as an eye specialist at the military hospital in Colchester before moving to the ophthalmic department in London's Second General Hospital. For five months Wallace was an inspector of ophthalmic centres in the eastern command and in 1919 he retired as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps. In 1924, at the invitation of John Blackwood McEwen, he joined the staff of the Royal Academy as a professor of harmony and composition, a post he retained until the year before his death. Though based in London, he and Ottilie bought a retirement home, Westport House, in Malmesbury, where he died on 16 December 1940 from bronchitis and the effects of Parkinson's disease.<br>
<br>External stimuli, be they Scottish, British, or more broadly European, were essential to Wallace's musical sensibility as he freely declared in his paper &#145;The scope of programme music&#146; for the Musical Association on 9 May 1899. This is evident in his output of six symphonic poems, <span class="italic">The Passing of Beatrice</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Amboss oder Hammer</span> (1896), <span class="italic">Sister Helen</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Greeting to the New Century</span> (1901), <span class="italic">Sir William Wallace AD, 1305&#150;1905</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">Villon</span> (1909), and his largest work, the <span class="italic">Creation Symphony</span>, begun in 1896 but not performed until 1899 at New Brighton. Several other symphonic poems including <span class="italic">Asperges</span>, <span class="italic">The Covenanters</span>, and <span class="italic">The Forty-Five</span> (all 1898) were unfinished, as was a three-movement choral symphony based on texts from <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>. Wallace's musical language was heavily informed by Liszt, Wagner, and the progressivist spirit of late nineteenth-century Europe, and this preoccupation gave rise to his books <span class="italic">Richard Wagner as he Lived</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">Liszt, Wagner, and the Princess</span> (1927). It was also fuelled by his friendship with Granville Bantock, and set him apart from what he perceived as the more conservative, Brahms-orientated disposition of the Royal College of Music and the ancient universities. Unintimidated by his contemporaries he openly criticized the college in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1904 over the administration of the patron's fund. He nevertheless found a common cause with Charles Villiers Stanford in the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1906.<br>
<br>Wallace's interest in the theatre (and Christian conviction) resulted in a mystery play, <span class="italic">The Divine Surrender</span> (1893), with incidental music (only the vocal scene <span class="italic">The Rhapsody of Mary Magdalene</span> survives), a prelude to Aeschylus's <span class="italic">The Eumenides</span>, and an unperformed lyric tragedy in one act, <span class="italic">Brassolis</span> (1896), as well as music for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1896) and Maurice Maeterlinck's <span class="italic">P&eacute;ll&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</span> (1897). Dubbed &#145;A Protean Spirit&#146; in <span class="italic">Musical Opinion</span> in 1920, Wallace evinced a broad interest in literature, drama, the visual arts, and science. He habitually mixed with painters such as Norman Hirst, Edwin James, Augustus John, Sholto Johnstone, James Douglas, and Detmar Blow&#151;together they briefly formed a circle called the Anonymous Academicians&#151;and later he was well acquainted with the &#145;Glasgow Boys&#146;&#151;the Irish painter John Lavery, and the sculptors John Tweed and Alfred Gilbert. He was active as a writer for the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, <span class="italic">The Musician</span>, and the <span class="italic">Royal Academy of Music Club Magazine</span>, wrote a set of short stories, <span class="italic">The Lighter Life</span> (1896), and authored two books, <span class="italic">The Threshold of Music</span> (1908) and <span class="italic">The Musical Faculty</span> (1914), in which he examined the physiological and psychological properties of music. He also contributed to the third edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1927&#150;8) and as a translator his work included Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Feuersnot</span> and Frederick Delius's <span class="italic">A Mass of Life</span>.<br>
