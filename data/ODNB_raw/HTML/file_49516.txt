<span class="headword">Salvesen,  (Salve) Christian Fredrik</span>  (1827&#150;1911), <span class="occ">shipowner and whaling entrepreneur</span>, was born on 8 March 1827 at Mandal, Norway, the eighth of nine children of Thomas Salvesen, merchant shipowner, and Johanna Ross. He was trained as a shipbroker in Stettin and Glasgow before joining his father's firm in 1846. Five years later, he married Amalie Georgina Salome Andorsen, daughter of Gulow Andorsen, a leading Mandal shipbuilder, and they had four sons and three daughters. Salvesen then moved to Leith, where his brother Theodor, a broker in nearby Grangemouth, financed a partnership (Turnbull and Salvesen, 1853&#150;1872) with George Turnbull, whose sister Jane married a third brother, now running the Mandal firm. After a slow start in broking, they prospered, importing timber from Salvesen's extended family and exporting coal from Turnbull's Scottish connections.<br>
<br>Shipbroking was also interwoven with part ownership of vessels (chiefly German) and ship management. Their first ship, <i>Syria</i>, was purchased in 1855, with support from Norway, where tramp shipowning was developing rapidly. Like his compatriots, Salvesen bought cheap wooden vessels, though it was a dispute over losses incurred with a more valuable ship trading to Australia that ended the partnership. Salvesen, trading alone (Christian Salvesen &amp; Co.), began buying steamers seriously in the 1880s, and in 1886 started a line to Stavanger. Its success was followed by runs along the Norwegian coast and to the Mediterranean; in the early twentieth century Salvesen owned sixteen vessels of assorted size and type.<br>
<br>Christian Salvesen, though cautious about trading ventures which might upset his agency customers, always used his family connections to find new ways of feeding his agency and filling his ships. He bought shares in Finnish forests, Norwegian copper, and Lofoten coal. The failure of his Paraffin Oil Company to process coal in Mandal led to promising oil exports from Scotland in 1866, when he travelled the Norwegian coast adding oil to his coal distribution network. However, oil exports turned to imports two years later when Svend Foyn established the modern whaling industry in Finnmark, and Salvesen, who supplied his coal, became the leading Scottish agent for his and subsequent whalers' oil.<br>
<br>In 1883 Salvesen, though still in control until his health failed in his eighties, delegated management of shipping operations to his eldest sons, Thomas Johan and Frederick Gulov, both trained in Germany, as partners. The third son, Edward Theodore Salvesen, became a distinguished maritime lawyer and judge (Lord Salvesen), but a new dynamism entered the firm in 1889 with the fourth son, Theodore Emile, educated in Norway and trained in Hamburg and Paris, who took on the timber and oil trades. It was Theodore who persuaded Christian to risk oil agency business by going into whaling in 1906, with Norwegian-type shore stations in Faeroe, Iceland, and especially Olna Firth in Shetland, where the company began total carcass utilization, which raised profitability and became a Salvesen hallmark. As interest moved to the Antarctic, work began in 1909 on Leith harbour in South Georgia, which cost over &pound;118,000 and produced &pound;35,000 profit in 1911, the year in which Christian died.<br>
<br>Although based in Britain, Salvesen and his family spoke&#151;and ate&#151;Norwegian at home and spent much time in Norway, maintaining those cordial family connections on which their success depended as their two countries grew closer in economic and social interdependence. Before his sons joined him, Christian Salvesen worked long hours in his office; but in later life he had time for public service in Leith and served the Dock commission and chamber of commerce. In 1859 he became a naturalized British citizen. However, he was made a knight of St Olav (first class) for public services in Norway, in 1891. He began his career indebted to his brother Theodor but, branching out on his own, founded a successful business, and expanded it through flexible entrepreneurship and careful innovation. By the time of his death Christian Salvesen &amp; Co. was the largest whaling company in the world, and for the next half century was best known as the leading single operator in Antarctic whaling.<br>
<br>Salvesen died on 15 January 1911 at his home, Mayfield House, East Trinity Road, Leith. His wife predeceased him.<br>
