<span class="headword">Pigott,  Robert</span>  (1736&#150;1794), <span class="occ">food and dress reformer</span>, was born at Chetwynd Park, Shropshire, the son of Robert Pigott (<i>d</i>. 1770) and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peers, of Criggion, Montgomeryshire. Chetwynd Park had been in his family's possession for three centuries. There Robert's great-grandfather Walter Pigott had entertained Charles I, <i>en route</i> from Oxford to Naseby, in 1645. A grandson of Walter Pigott, also named Robert (1664&#150;1746), had been MP for Huntingdonshire (1713&#150;22, 1730&#150;41). A staunch Jacobite, he had met the Pretender in Rome in 1720.<br>
<br>Robert Pigott followed a markedly different political philosophy and was given to outlandish social conduct. At Newmarket in 1770 he and the son of Sir William Codrington made a bet of 500 guineas as to which of their fathers would outlive the other. It turned out that the elder Pigott had died at Chetwynd a few hours prior to the bet. Pigott consequently maintained that the wager was void, but Lord March, as Codrington's assignee, sued for the money, and Lord Mansfield decided that the bet was valid, inasmuch as neither party knew at the time of anything to vitiate it.<br>
<br>In 1774 Pigott became high sheriff of Shropshire. In 1776, imagining that the outbreak of the American War of Independence heralded England's imminent ruin, he sold his Chetwynd and Chesterton estates, worth &pound;9000 a year, and retired to the continent, where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire, Brissot, and Benjamin Franklin. He lived mostly at Geneva but paid occasional visits to England. While on the continent he became a zealous Pythagorean or vegetarian, and was an advocate of the benefits to be had from James Graham's &#145;celestial bed&#146;, displayed in London in 1780.<br>
<br>Pigott was enraptured by the French Revolution, especially in its more extravagant aspects. He protested against Siey&egrave;s's press bill and published his protest, which in February 1791 he had read to the revolutionary club at Lyons. In an appendix he advocated a vegetarian diet for prisoners as a means of reclaiming them, and at a meeting of the Dijon assembly of the Friends of the Constitution he condemned the use of bread, recommending instead potatoes, lentils, maize, barley, and rice. Another address to the assembly, <i>en faveur du bonnet de la libert&eacute;</i>, delivered on 26 December 1791, was directed against the wearing of hats, a practice which he claimed had been introduced by priests and despots, and that they concealed the face. In their place he encouraged the wearing of caps, which, he maintained, left the natural dignity of the countenance untouched. For some weeks the cap movement was very popular in Paris but the remonstrance addressed by P&eacute;tion to the Jacobin club put an end to it, and the <i>bonnet rouge</i> introduced later had no connection with Pigott's treatise. Pigott contemplated the purchase and occupation of a confiscated estate in the south of France, but this came to nothing. In 1792 he probably settled at Toulouse, where he died on 7 July 1794, leaving a widow, Antoinette Boutan, about whom no further details are known.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_22250"></a><span class="headword">Charles Pigott</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">radical and satirist</span>, was also an ardent champion of the French Revolution and, like many other radicals, published in 1791 a reply to Edmund Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections on the French Revolution</span>. He issued, anonymously, the popular satire, <span class="italic">The Jockey Club</span> (1792) and, in 1794, <span class="italic">The Female Jockey Club</span> and <span class="italic">The Whig Club</span>, both of which offered a scurrilous account of &eacute;lite London society, with which he seems to have been well acquainted. He died at Westminster on 24 June 1794, leaving a satire entitled <span class="italic">The Political Dictionary</span>, published posthumously in the following year. Robert's and Charles's niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22253/', "Harriet Pigott")</script>, was a celebrated nineteenth-century memoirist.<br>
