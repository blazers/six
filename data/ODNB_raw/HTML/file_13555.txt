<span class="headword">Holles,  John</span>, second earl of Clare  (1595&#150;1666), <span class="occ">aristocrat</span>, was born at Haughton, Nottinghamshire, on 13 June 1595, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13554/', "John Holles, first earl of Clare (d. 1637)")</script>, and Anne Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1651); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13550/', "Denzil Holles")</script>, the politician, was a younger brother. Holles attended Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1611 and was admitted to Gray's Inn in February 1612. He lived in Paris in 1615&#150;16. His 1621 election for Gatton, Surrey, was annulled by the House of Commons; when returned for both Mitchell, Cornwall, and East Retford in 1624 he chose to represent the latter, a Nottinghamshire borough. He was re-elected for East Retford in 1625 and 1626, when he was known as Lord Haughton following his father's elevation to the earldom of Clare, and on 24 September 1626 married Elizabeth Vere (<i>d</i>. 1683), daughter of Horace Vere, Baron Vere of Tilbury; he joined his father-in-law at the siege of Bois-le-Duc in 1629. He succeeded to the earldom in 1637.<br>
<br>Clare lacked political ambition and was accepted by the king to have &#145;no manner of relation to the Court&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.142). In 1639 he claimed financial difficulties prevented him from producing the required equipage to attend on the king, then engaged against the Scots in the First Bishops' War. He joined the Lords in the 1640 Short Parliament, who voted that redress of grievances should precede supply. At the great council of peers held in September 1640 illness prevented him from acting as a commissioner to raise a royal loan from London, but he was appointed to advise the counties on the lending of money to the king. With the Long Parliament's 1641 impeachment of his brother-in-law, the earl of Strafford, Clare tried to counter the prosecution through his questioning of Secretary Vane over what Strafford had said at the crucial council meeting of 5 May 1640. When on 6 May 1641 the attack proceeded to voting on a bill of attainder against Strafford, he was excused for being absent from the upper house.<br>
<br>Thereafter Clare's stance showed some affinity with that of the &#145;popular&#146; peers. He joined with five peers in September 1641 to protest at the Lords' decision to reissue their order of January 1641 upholding established church services, in opposition to the Commons' resolution ordering the removal of Laudian &#145;innovations&#146;. In December 1641 his apprehension about the appointment of the royal nominee, Thomas Lunsford, to the sensitive military post of lieutenant of the Tower was recorded and in the next month he was among a substantial minority of the Lords who protested at the rejection of the Commons' proposal that parliamentary control of the militia was absolutely necessary. After these protests he was the obvious parliamentarian appointee as lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire but he took no action to implement the militia ordinance. Instead, by June 1642 he had joined the king at York and signed a declaration that Charles had no intention to make war on parliament; Clarendon remembered that at this time he &#145;was looked upon as a man not only firm to the principles of monarchy but of duty to the person of the King&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.153). Having learned of the king's resolution to raise his standard for war, however, Clare was among three peers who left York, having failed to persuade the king against this step. He returned to the residue of the Lords at Westminster in August when he was thanked for his carriage at York which &#145;tended to the preservation of the peace of the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 5.284).<br>
<br>In the following month Clare was appointed to the committee for the safety of the kingdom and attended the Lords until August 1643. It was after the rejection of the Lords' peace propositions by the Commons that he followed the earls of Holland and Bedford to the king's court at Oxford. He was received by Charles at the siege of Gloucester, fought with the royalists at the battle of Newbury, and was admitted to the councils of war, yet royalist hostility to the peace proposals, in turn, opened his eyes and, &#145;undeceived&#146;, he left Oxford and eventually returned to London. In a letter of April 1644 to Essex which gives an explanation of his action he claimed it was &#145;the cause only and no other particular By-respects hath brought me back&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 6.495&#150;6). Though the sequestration of his estates was rescinded and he took the covenant in April 1645, attempts to secure his readmission to the Lords failed. After his return Clare's political affiliations showed a consistency which had previously been absent. In June 1645 parliament appointed him to the Nottinghamshire committee of the northern association and in March 1646 warden of Sherwood Forest. After the first civil war he tried to restore order to Sherwood and continued during the Commonwealth and protectorate in his attempts to apply forest law and preserve the woods. He retained throughout these years his recordership of Nottingham.<br>
<br>It was not until April 1660, when he was reported to be ready to follow the earl of Bedford and take his seat in the Lords, that Clare again began to consider taking a part in national politics. It needed a letter from the Lords asking him to attend before he took his seat on 5 May 1660 and he was a conscientious member of the Convention Parliament during its first few months and attended irregularly the Cavalier Parliament. The earl was more successful in persuading the king of his loyalty than the Nottinghamshire royalists. He was appointed to the standing council to consider the future regulation of the colonies but it needed the intervention of Charles II and Clarendon to defeat the attempts of the Nottinghamshire corporation commissioners to remove him from the recordership of Nottingham. Clare, they insisted, was a person whose &#145;good affection and zeale to our service we have no cause at all to doute&#146;  (U. Nott. L., MS Pw V 4, 286&#150;7).<br>
<br>Clare had been taught by his father to be a careful steward of his inherited estates. They were concentrated in north Nottinghamshire and the parish of St Clement Danes, Middlesex, which was part of the rapidly growing London property market. He was purchasing land before his father's death and continued until the civil war the family's policy of seizing every opportunity to consolidate and enlarge its estates. He claimed in 1639 that his income was not near &pound;4000, but his rental accounts showing &pound;4069 0<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. for that year prove that this estimate had been exceeded. During the interregnum Clare's major project was the improvement of and erection of new properties in and around St Clement Danes parish, for which he paid a fine in the protectorate of &pound;1500 and spent &pound;12,299 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. before 1661. In 1657 he was given permission by parliament to hold a market and this privilege was confirmed in 1661. The last recorded rentals from Michaelmas 1664 to Lady day 1665 totalled &pound;6626 3<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. After Clare's death on 2 January 1666 the estate, which was encumbered by provision for dowries for his daughters and debts, descended to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13553/', "Gilbert Holles, third earl of Clare")</script>. Clare was buried at St Mary's Church, Nottingham.<br>
