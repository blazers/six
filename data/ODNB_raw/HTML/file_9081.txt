<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Ferdinando</span>, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron  (1584&#150;1648), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was born on 29 March 1584 at Denton Hall, in the parish of Otley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9091/', "Thomas Fairfax, first Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1560&#150;1640)")</script>, and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Robert Aske of Aughton and his wife, Elizabeth. The warlike Thomas had been a soldier in the Low Countries and France, and was to purchase the peerage for &pound;1500 in 1627. He reportedly said that he sent Ferdinando &#145;into the Netherlands to train him up a soldier, and he makes a tolerable country justice, but is a mere coward at fighting&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Lord Fairfax</span>, 12). Having been admitted to Gray's Inn on 3 May 1602, Ferdinando was knighted at Theobalds on 30 January 1608. One commemoration of his funeral recounted: &#145;in his younger yeares he was given to the study of Arts and Sciences, that must make him usefull and serviceable to his Countrey, and not to Dogs, Hawkes, &amp;c.&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Narrative</span>, 4).<br>
<br>In 1607 Fairfax married Mary Sheffield (<i>d</i>. 1619), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25293/', "Edmund Sheffield, first earl of Mulgrave")</script>, lord president of the council of the north, and his first wife, Ursula. Mary died in childbirth at Steeton in 1619, and Fairfax remained a widower for twenty-seven years. He was MP for Boroughbridge in the parliaments of 1614, 1621, 1624, 1628, and the Short Parliament of 1640. He entered the West Riding's commission of the peace in 1611 and was a particularly active justice, defending the authority of the post against interference from the council of the north. Fairfax was of Calvinist sympathies and by the early 1640s was mildly presbyterian. During the 1629 parliament he reported to his father with evident sympathy the sense of the House of Commons that &#145;the danger by the growth of Arminianism and countenancing of [its] professors&#146; threatened the very &#145;subversion of the religion now established&#146;  (Johnson, 1.155). During the 1630s he assisted godly ministers in trouble with ecclesiastical authority, while the influence of Richard Neile, archbishop of York, intruded onto his estates and, as a principal governor of Otley grammar school, he resented Neile's intervention over the choice of headmaster. He came to desire that episcopal power should be limited and sponsored presbyterian preaching in the West Riding. However, in March 1641 he expressed his opposition to altering the liturgy, &#145;which many shoot at&#146;  (ibid., 1.180).<br>
<br>Fairfax remained loyal during the bishops' wars, commanding a regiment of trained bands in the royal army, but on 10 September 1640 he helped organize the petition of Yorkshire gentry calling for a parliament. In October he was returned to the Long Parliament as knight of the shire for Yorkshire, where he joined the opposition to royal policies. He assisted in the trial of the earl of Strafford and was among the committee that presented the grand remonstrance to the king. When the king established himself at York in March 1642 Fairfax was among the five parliamentary commissioners who arrived on 8 May to observe his actions. While in York on 17 June he fell from his horse and broke two ribs; he withdrew to Denton to patronize godly sermons and prepare his neighbourhood for armed resistance. He headed the declaration at Otley on 29 August condemning the king's raising of forces, and on 7 September he wrote to request arms from parliament's governor of Hull, Sir John Hotham. He was proclaimed leader of Yorkshire's parliamentarians at Leeds on 19 September, provoking Hotham's animosity by concluding a treaty of neutrality with leading royalists at Rothwell on 29 September. Parliament condemned the treaty and encouraged Fairfax to abandon it.<br>
<br>On 21 October 1642 Fairfax repelled a royalist attack on his headquarters at Bradford and, joining with forces sent from Hull, blockaded the royalists in York. On 3 December he received his commission as general of parliament's forces in the northern counties, but he was forced to retreat as the earl of Newcastle's larger royalist army marched southwards. On 6 December he successfully defended Tadcaster from that army, but he was forced to retreat that night to establish new headquarters at Selby. In January and February 1643 he engaged in a propaganda battle with the earl of Newcastle, accusing him of invading Yorkshire with an army largely officered by Roman Catholics. On 5 February he was hailed during John Shaw's sermon to his army as &#145;our new Joshua of the North&#146;  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Diaries and Autobiographies in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries</span>, ed. C. Jackson, Surtees Society, 65, 1877, 367). The motto on his standard, the only one in Spanish on either side, read <i>Viva el rey y muerra el mal govierno</i> (&#145;Long live the king and death to bad government&#146;; I. Gentles, &#145;The iconography of revolution: England, 1642&#150;1649&#146;, <span class="italic">Soldiers, Writers and Statesmen of the English Revolution: Essays Presented to Austin Woolrych</span>, ed. I. Gentles, J. Morrill, and B. Worden, 1998, 109).<br>
<br>The defection of Sir Hugh Cholmley and doubts over Hotham's continued allegiance led Fairfax to move his headquarters to Leeds on 30 March, and <i>en route</i> his rearguard was defeated at Seacroft Moor. In April he resisted Newcastle's attacks on Leeds, but on 30 June he was severely defeated at Adwalton Moor, near Bradford. He fled through Leeds to Selby and then by boat to Hull where he found that Hotham had just been arrested for conspiracy to betray the town. Fairfax was welcomed and appointed governor on 22 July. Within weeks he raised a new force which provoked Newcastle's army into besieging Hull on 2 September. A decisive sally on 11 October 1643 ended the siege, and he spent the winter regaining control of the East Riding for parliament. On 11 April 1644 his army captured Selby, Fairfax himself leading one of the storming divisions, and so Newcastle's army was forced to return to defend York. Joining forces with the Scots and parliament's eastern association army, Fairfax besieged York. After the siege was broken by Prince Rupert he commanded the infantry on the right of the victorious allied army at Marston Moor on 2 July, where his younger son, Charles, was slain. After the city's surrender on 16 July Fairfax was appointed governor of York, where, along with his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9092/', "Sir Thomas Fairfax")</script>, he protected the minster from iconoclasm and preserved the library and archives. Sir Thomas had served as his general of horse in the northern campaigns, and despite their early defeats of 1643, the Fairfaxes' tenacity and powers of recovery contributed a great deal to frustrating the royalist war effort.<br>
<br>Fairfax resigned his command when the self-denying ordinance was passed but remained influential on the parliamentary committee at York established to govern the northern counties. On 21 January 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax was appointed general of parliament's New Model Army. Ferdinando's pay arrears amounted to &pound;13,480, of which he had received only &pound;2,069 by August 1646. At St Giles-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, on 16 October 1646, he married Rhoda Hussey (1616/17&#150;1686), daughter of Thomas Chapman of London and widow of Thomas Hussey of Lincolnshire. Part of Fairfax's pay arrears had been assigned from the composition fine of her late husband's royalist father, Sir Edward Hussey.<br>
<br>Fairfax died at Denton Hall on 13 or 14 March 1648 from a fever caused by a gangrenous foot. He was survived by his second wife, and was succeeded by his son Sir Thomas. His will directed that his funeral should be &#145;without much pomp or ceremony&#146;  (Johnson, 1.xc), and on 15 March he was buried beside his first wife at All Saints' Church, Bolton Percy, where a monumental inscription remains to his memory. His library is now held by York Minster and consists of about 400 volumes, some of which had been owned by Sir John Hotham.<br>
