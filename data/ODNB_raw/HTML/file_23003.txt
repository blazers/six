<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rae,  John</span>  (1813&#150;1893), <span class="occ">Arctic explorer</span>, was born on 30 September 1813 at the Hall of Clestrain, near Stromness, Orkney Islands, the sixth of nine children of John Rae, factor, an Orcadian, and his wife, Margaret Glen, a Campbell from Argyll. He spent his boyhood in Orkney, being educated by a tutor at home, before going to Edinburgh to study medicine in 1829. He qualified in April 1833 as licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and was appointed surgeon of the Hudson's Bay Company's ship <i>Prince of Wales</i> in June 1833. From 1834 to 1844 he was surgeon at Moose Factory, the company post on James Bay: &#145;the best place east of the Rocky Mountains &hellip; a very happy home to me for ten years&#146;  (Richards, 20). Here he took part in the general work of the post and tended patients among the company's employees and local Cree people. During his leisure time, he &#145;learned all the different methods of hunting, fishing, sledge-hauling, snow-shoe walking and camping out &hellip; that were afterwards so useful to me in my Arctic exploration&#146;  (Richards, 22).<br>
<br>In 1844 Rae was chosen by the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Sir George Simpson, to lead an expedition to complete the survey of the northern coastline of North America, partly accomplished by the fur traders, Samuel Hearne, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Peter Dease, and Thomas Simpson, and by naval parties led by Sir John Franklin. With ten men, Rae left York Factory (on the western coast of Hudson Bay) on 13 June 1846 in two small boats, northward bound. At Churchill an Inuit interpreter named Ouligbuck and his son joined them. They reached Repulse Bay on 24 July and learned from a party of Inuit that the sea lay some 40 miles to the north-west, the route being partly taken up by deep lakes. This route was traversed with one of the boats, the <i>North Pole</i>. They reached Committee Bay, where Rae's attempts to survey the coast by boat were thwarted by ice and bad weather. He turned back on 8 August and established winter quarters on Repulse Bay, where Fort Hope was built. Game was shot for the winter, and store houses and two magnetic observatories constructed. During sledge journeys in the spring and summer of 1847, the party reached Lord Mayor's Bay, on the east coast of Boothia peninsula, connecting their survey with that of Sir John and Sir James Clark Ross in 1829&#150;33, and explored the west coast of Melville peninsula, almost reaching Fury and Hecla Strait, explored by Sir William Edward Parry in 1821&#150;3. They returned by boat to York Factory on 6 September 1847, when Rae heard of his promotion to chief trader. He wrote a <span class="italic">Narrative of an Expedition to the Shores of the Arctic Sea in 1846 and 1847</span> (1850). The expedition was significant, not only for its geographical and meteorological results, but because the party was able to winter in the Arctic by eating local game and fish and building igloos.<br>
<br>During 1848&#150;9, Rae joined Sir John Richardson (at the latter's request) to search for Sir John Franklin. Richardson, Rae, and party made an extremely fast (possibly record long distance) canoe journey from Sault Ste Marie near Toronto to the mouth of the Mackenzie River on the Arctic Ocean in ninety-six days, arriving on 3 August 1848. They travelled east along the coast, but ice hampered their search. They wintered at Fort Confidence on Great Bear Lake, making regular meteorological and magnetic observations. Richardson went back to England in 1849, while Rae returned down the Coppermine River to the Arctic Ocean. He explored the Rae River, which Richardson had named after him the previous year, but ice forced him to abandon attempts to travel westward along the coast and northward to &#145;Wollaston Land&#146; (later peninsula). In September 1849 the party travelled up the Mackenzie River to Fort Simpson where Rae took up his post as chief trader. In his <span class="italic">Arctic Searching Expedition</span> (1851) Richardson paid generous tribute to Rae.<br>
<br>With his new appointment, Rae had responsibility for the Mackenzie River district, the company's largest, but found the unaccustomed business management and accounting difficult. In June 1850 he was promoted chief factor. He wintered at Fort Confidence in 1850&#150;51 to resume the search for Franklin at the Admiralty's request. Two boats were built to Rae's specification and rigged by Rae himself. He left Fort Confidence on 25 April 1851, and with two men, sledges, and dogs, crossed over the ice of Dolphin and Union Strait, reaching Wollaston peninsula on 6 May. He then travelled eastward along the coast of Victoria Island, finding that no strait divided Wollaston &#145;Land&#146; from Victoria &#145;Land&#146; and linking his own explorations with those of Dease and Simpson in 1839. He retraced his steps westward along the shores of the Wollaston peninsula as far as Prince Albert Sound. The party reached Kendall River on 10 June, having covered some 824 miles in 42 days.<br>
<br>Rae set out again from Kendall River on 15 June with a party of eleven, in the two boats built at Fort Confidence, reaching the mouth of the Coppermine River on 5 July and the eastern end of the Kent peninsula on 24 July. They sailed to Victoria Island, exploring Cambridge Bay and the shores to the north-east, sighting Pelly Point on the Collinson peninsula. The walking was so rough that their footwear quickly wore out and every step &#145;was marked with blood&#146;  (Richards, 80). Unfortunately the ice in Victoria Strait was too closely packed for the boats to reach King William Island where the Franklin tragedy had been enacted in 1848. Rae did find two pieces of wood while returning along the south coast of Victoria Island, which probably came from the <i>Erebus</i> or the <i>Terror</i>. These he brought back to England. The party returned to Fort Confidence on 10 September 1851, having crossed the narrows at the junction of Dolphin and Union Strait with Coronation Gulf. Rae reached Fort Simpson on 26 September ending a highly successful exploring expedition, which none the less left the mystery of Franklin's disappearance unsolved. He arrived in London in April 1852 and in May was awarded the founder's gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society. The same month he proposed to the Hudson's Bay Company a further Arctic expedition to complete the survey of the north coast of America along the west coast of the Boothia peninsula. This they approved and Rae was appointed leader in June 1852. He reached York Factory on 18 June 1853, and with his party ascended the unexplored Quoich River from Chesterfield inlet in July and August and wintered at Repulse Bay, at first in tents, then in snow huts. In the spring, with sledges and four men, including Ouligbuck the younger as interpreter, Rae travelled to Pelly Bay, arriving on 17 April 1854. On 21 April, he met &#145;a very communicative and apparently intelligent Eskimo&#146;, who said that &#145;a number of Kabloonans, at least 35&#150;40, had starved to death west of a large river a long way off&#146;. This was the first news of the tragedy of the Franklin expedition. Rae bought a cap band from the Inuit, who had not seen the dead bodies himself, and &#145;could not or would not&#146; explain the place on the chart  (Richards, 98). Rae continued his survey, thinking the information too vague to act upon, but asking his informant to produce more evidence. On 27 April the party reached the cairn built by Dease and Simpson at the mouth of the Castor and Pollux River in 1839. They then travelled along the west coast of the Boothia peninsula, and on their return journey to Repulse Bay carefully examined the coast of Pelly Bay, finding no strait to the west. They reached Repulse Bay on 26 May.<br>
<br>From other Inuit, Rae obtained artefacts from the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, received from yet others who had observed some forty white men on King William Island dragging a boat and sledges to the south, and had later found the bodies of about thirty men and some graves on the mainland and five bodies on an island (which Rae thought must be Montreal Island at the mouth of the Great Fish or Back River). He reached York Factory in time to sail for England in the <i>Prince of Wales</i> on 20 September, bringing the first news of Franklin's fate. Geographically, his discovery that King William &#145;Land&#146; was separated from the Boothia peninsula by a strait (later called after him) was also important, and although he failed to complete the survey of the west coast of the Peninsula, he proved that it formed part of the mainland of North America.<br>
<br>Rae arrived in London on Sunday 22 October 1854 and his report to the Admiralty was published in full in <span class="italic">The Times</span> next day. It caused a sensation, mainly because it repeated the suggestion of the Inuit that the last survivors had resorted to cannibalism. A public controversy ensued and Rae was criticized for not having verified the Inuit reports himself and for having hurried home to claim the &pound;10,000 offered to the discoverer of Franklin's fate; a reward of which he insisted he was ignorant until his return to England. In the end, he received &pound;8000 and his findings were largely confirmed by Sir Leopold McClintock in 1857&#150;9. Rae's biographer has commended his &#145;dignity and restraint&#146; during the controversy  (Richards, 131). He was awarded the honorary degree of MD by McGill University, Montreal, in 1853.<br>
<br>In 1857 (having retired the previous year), Rae appeared on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company before a select committee of the House of Commons in London, which was convened to investigate the company's activities before the expiry of its charter in 1859. In Toronto in January 1860 Rae married Catherine Jane Alicia (Kate), third child of Major George Ash Thompson of Ardkill, co. Londonderry, and Munechrone, co. Tyrone, Ireland. The Raes made their home in Britain, although Rae travelled in Canada from time to time and took part in telegraph surveys in 1860 and in 1864. He divided his last years (1870&#150;93) between London and Orkney. In 1866 he had been made an honorary LLD by Edinburgh University and in 1880, having contributed articles to <span class="italic">Nature</span> and other learned journals, he was made fellow of the Royal Society. He died at his home, 4 Addison Gardens, Kensington, London, of a ruptured aneurism on 22 July 1893. He was buried in the churchyard of St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney, where an impressive memorial was erected by public subscription in 1895.<br>
<br>Rae got on well with his superiors and fellow officers of the Hudson's Bay Company, and with Inuit and Indians. He spoke well of the naval explorers Parry, Franklin, and Richardson but felt later that neither he nor the Hudson's Bay Company was given sufficient credit for Arctic exploration by Sir Clements Markham and others, who championed the navy. In more recent times, Rae has attracted admirers such as Vilhjalmur Stefansson, not only for his discoveries, but for his ability to &#145;live off the land&#146;.<br>
