<span class="headword">Morell,  John</span>  (1775&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 16 May 1775 at Maldon, Essex, the second of the four children of Stephen Morell (1727&#150;1815) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> King (1739&#150;1810). His great-grandfather Daniel Morell (<i>b</i>. 1666) was a Huguenot from the Champagne area of France who fled to Ireland, and whose son married into the Conte family of similar descent.<br>
<br>The Morells had close connections with the Independent church at Maldon, and all three sons became ministers of Independent churches. Following removal to London, John and his elder brother Stephen (1773&#150;1852) were sent to Rothwell, Northamptonshire, to prepare for the ministry, and later to the grammar school at Hitchin, where the family then resided. Entry to Homerton College followed, the brothers being Trotman grantees in 1792 and 1793 respectively. Their younger brother Thomas (1781&#150;1840) followed in 1799, having received a grounding in classics from his brothers.<br>
<br>Morell started his ministry in Independency at Foulmire, Cambridgeshire, then at Blandford, Dorset. In 1796 he took the pulpit formerly occupied by Thomas Belsham at Daventry, where he may have come in contact with Unitarian thinking. For health reasons he moved to a Presbyterian pulpit at Enfield, Middlesex, about 1798. The failure of his voice and his altered religious opinions led to his resignation in 1802.<br>
<br>Morell successively kept schools in Exeter, Nottingham, and in various places around London until 1816. He married Elizabeth (1779&#150;1852), daughter of Revd John Reynell and his wife, Mary, of Thorverton, Devon, on 5 August 1812; they had two daughters and a son. In 1814 he was awarded a doctor of laws degree, probably from a German university, &#145;procured for him by his friends, entirely without his knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, May 1840). By this time he was firmly in the Unitarian fold, and during 1816 and 1817 was classical and mathematical tutor at Hackney Academy, run by Revd Robert Aspland for intending ministers of Unitarian congregations. From at least 1815 he wrote regularly for Unitarian journals.<br>
<br>In January 1818 Morell moved to Brighton, Sussex, where he ran a successful school, as well as becoming Unitarian minister at Cavendish Street Chapel. It was decided to erect a new Unitarian church in New Road on land purchased from the prince regent, and Morell was appointed as first minister. He was charged with the design, which he believed should be classical in style. Opened in 1820, it was based in outline on the Temple of Theseus. Admired by many as elegant, the church was dismissed by the <span class="italic">Royal Brighton Guide</span> of 1827 &#145;as built after the manner of a heathen temple&#146;. Its Doric portico was a striking addition to the centre of Brighton.<br>
<br>Morell's importance lies in the influence he had over his pupils at his school at Hove. These included Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Professor Thomas Solly, Henry Solly, and Henry Acton. The last two were Unitarian ministers, and there were several other men whom Morell influenced to take a similar path by his fine mind, classical learning, and liberal sentiments. Henry Solly writes at length about his time at Morell's school and what was taught: &#145;The good Dr &hellip; had a very kindly heart, large sympathies, and in general a pleasant genial manner&#146;  (Solly, 1.93).<br>
<br>Apart from John, the numerous other Morells who became ministers of religion remained Independent (later Congregationalist). His brother Stephen ministered at Little Baddow, Essex, for over fifty years and was succeeded by his son. Another died at the start of a ministerial career, while the youngest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19200/', "John Daniel Morell")</script>, left the ministry to become the first inspector of schools. Thomas Morell was a leading theological writer and tutor, who at the time of his death in February 1840 was president of Coward College; his only son died at the start of a ministerial career.<br>
<br>John Morell retired from the Unitarian ministry at Brighton in 1827, passing his school at Hove to his successor in that pulpit, J. P. Malleson. Morell then travelled with his family in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy for the next few years, returning to settle in Bath in 1836, where he died on 11 April 1840. He was buried on 19 April in Lyncombe cemetery near Bath.<br>
