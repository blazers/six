<span class="headword">Barnaby,  Francis</span>  (<em>b. </em>1573, <em>d.</em> in or after 1621), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in the parish of Cawthorne, Yorkshire, on 21 May 1573 to Thomas Barnaby of Barnby basin and his wife, Beatrice Burdett. According to his own account he was educated at Oxford University and the inns of court, and arrived at Rheims on 13 January 1593. From there he was sent to Rome where he was admitted to the English College on 14 March 1593 and ordained on 30 November 1598. He returned to England the following year and was imprisoned in the Marshalsea by June 1599, but it appears that he was there chiefly to report to the government on his fellow priests. Along with other prisoners he was sent to Framlingham in 1601, by which time he was a strong advocate of the appellants' cause in their row with the Jesuits over loyalty to the regime. He was given leave to go to Rome with Christopher Bagshawe to prosecute the appellants' cause there in 1601, but after a disruptive stay at Douai he did not continue his journey, returning to England by way of Paris early in 1602. He was prisoner in the Clink by 11 April, but was given much freedom, being in constant touch with Bagshawe in Paris, with Bancroft, bishop of London, as a go-between. He was among those appellants who signed the memorial of allegiance in January 1603, and was given permission to cross to Paris where he also signed the memorial to Clement VIII on 3 May 1603. He travelled between the Clink, which was more or less his home, and Paris for the next year, and was probably in Paris when Bagshawe drew up the articles for peace and concord among English Catholic clergy in August 1603 in which it was suggested that Persons, Garnet, and other leading Jesuits be removed from England and the archpriest be deposed. It was in that year that he collaborated with William Clark in publishing a tract against Persons, <span class="italic">A Reply unto a Certain Libel Lately Set Forth by Fr Persons</span>, arguing the appellants' case. Back in prison in November 1603 Barnaby revealed details of the Bye plot, for which two of his fellow priests were executed, to the government, and in 1604 was granted a special pardon by the archbishop of Canterbury. In that year he was said to be active in Yorkshire, visiting his family home in the company of Anthony Champney, but nothing further is known of his activities until he turned up in Ireland as chaplain to Mabel Browne, a relative of the Catholic peer Viscount Montague, as a signatory to the oath of allegiance in Dublin in 1612. Described in 1599 as &#145;of personage tall and slender, fair complexion with a fresh colour, his hair reddish; no beard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 9.200), his last appearance in the record finds him back at his family home in Barnby on 8 February 1621 writing to the archbishops of York and Canterbury with details of the activities of Catholic priests, an act consistent with his previous commitment to allegiance, but one which tarnished his reputation with his co-religionists at the time and subsequently.<br>
