<span class="headword">Farley,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1712, <em>d.</em> 1791), <span class="occ">exchequer official and antiquary</span>, was born in Kent, probably at Linton, where he was baptized in August 1712. He was the son of Abraham and Sarah Farley, of Linton, who had at least two other children, a son, John, who died before 1775, and a daughter, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1775). Farley seems to have spent his whole career, and presumably came by much of his education, in the public service. He was appointed a deputy chamberlain of the exchequer in 1736, and subsequently became first clerk to Richard Morley, the keeper of the public records deposited in the chapter house at Westminster. Farley married Jane Askew at St Katharine by the Tower on 9 November 1744; they had a son, Abraham, and three daughters. Abraham was christened in 1745 at St John's, Smith Square, and probably died young. Farley succeeded Morley in 1773, but held the keepership jointly with George Rose (1744&#150;1818), who was later vice-president of the Board of Trade and treasurer to the navy. They shared the office until Farley's death.<br>
<br>Farley had long experience of making official transcripts of the records, a valuable perquisite for their custodians, and was often consulted by antiquaries. He undertook some collation for the printing of the <span class="italic">Rotuli parliamentorum</span> in 1767, but he had a long-standing interest in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. When the printing of <span class="roman">Domesday</span> was authorized by parliament, largely at the urging of Charles Morton (1716&#150;1799), later principal librarian of the British Museum, Farley submitted a proposal to the Treasury, urging his expert knowledge of the volume, which he said had been in his care for nearly thirty years. The work was, however, entrusted to Morton. The original intention was to produce a facsimile, but both engraved plates, and Morton's own preference for a specially cut type proved impracticable. In 1770 the Treasury therefore endorsed a fresh start on a printed text, and associated Farley with the work.<br>
<br>The partnership was uneasy, and Farley eventually excluded Morton from printing and correcting the sheets. They were, however, able to agree in 1774 on the use of a record type designed by John Nichols (1745&#150;1826) for texts in John Hutchins's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset</span> and refined by Nichols and his apprentice Vincent Figgins. The type was an ingenious innovation, mischievous in the long run because it was used indiscriminately and often carelessly for more than a century, but a measure of the awe which the density and complexity of <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> inspired.<br>
<br>From that point Farley took over the entire transcription, moving on to the second volume, known as <span class="roman">Little Domesday</span>, in 1779, and working closely with Nichols at every stage of the intricate setting and correcting which followed. The two volumes were printed in 1783, without preliminary pages or other apparatus. They were distributed, as had always been the intention, only to members of either house of parliament, and under warrant to nine learned institutions. Farley received &pound;2500 for his share of the work.<br>
<br>Formal publication had to wait some thirty years for the issue of 250 sets with additional material issued by the record commissioners in 1811, and a reprinting in 1816&#150;17, which included an introduction by Sir Henry Ellis. Scholarly work on <span class="roman">Domesday</span> was nevertheless greatly facilitated from 1783 onwards, and the exceptional precision of Farley's text, which replicated not only the foliation but the lines and spacing of the original, was readily recognized and acclaimed. John Nichols reprinted the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> survey of Leicestershire in his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the Town and County of Leicester</span> (1795&#150;1815), and translations of other county entries soon followed.<br>
<br>Farley's daughters were Jane, who married the Revd James Wynter (1743&#150;1814) (later rector of Tyringham-cum-Filgrave, Buckinghamshire), and Sarah, who married Charles Henry Tufnell (1770&#150;1822) (later vicar of All Saints', Northampton). A third daughter married Mark Wade of Orford, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Farley died early in 1791, having made his will on 21 January: probate was granted to his executors, both of St John's parish, on 22 March. He left freehold and copyhold property at Stockbury and Sutton Valance in Kent, in Middlesex and London, in Essex, and in Suffolk, to his wife for her life with reversion to his daughters, and to his grandson, Mark Farley Wade. He also bequeathed the use of his silver plate to his wife, with reversion to his daughters, among other legacies.<br>
<br>All subsequent students of <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> have been in debt to Farley. His transcript of the manuscript was preternaturally exact, even given his long familiarity with the record and the many office-copies he had undertaken. His attention to the proofs also impressed Nichols, an able and experienced publisher. He seems not to have pursued any wider antiquarian studies, but he plainly knew as much about <span class="roman">Domesday</span> as any of those who have followed him in elucidating its beguiling and perennially rewarding text.<br>
