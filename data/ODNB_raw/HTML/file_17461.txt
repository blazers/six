<span class="headword">MacDonnell,  Randal</span>, first earl of Antrim  (<em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">chieftain and landowner</span>, was the fourth of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17465/', "Sorley Boy MacDonnell (b. in or before 1508, d. 1590)")</script>, Scots-Irish chieftain, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1582), daughter of Con O'Neill, first earl of Tyrone. He was apparently called Arranagh owing to the fact that as a child he was fostered by the Stewart family of the Scottish island of Arran. In 1597 he helped his elder brother Sir James MacDonnell fortify Dunluce and defeat an English expedition commanded by Sir John Chichester, governor of Carrickfergus. In April 1601, on Sir James's death, MacDonnell became chieftain of the Glens and Route in preference to Sir James's teenage son. In December he joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20775/', "Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone")</script>, on his march south with 400 men. Only thirty survived their defeat at Kinsale. In August 1602 he submitted to Lord Deputy Mountjoy, undertaking to serve against Tyrone with 500 foot and forty horse at his own expense, and was knighted. <br>
<br>On 23 May 1603 MacDonnell was granted his territories as a personal estate by Mountjoy. Initially James I favoured the claim of the clan chieftain, MacDonald of Dunyvaig, but in 1604 MacDonnell's grant was confirmed and Rathlin included. Subsequently the Dublin administration reduced the grants to the Ulster chieftains, excluding church lands and significant strongholds. In 1606 Dunluce, Olderfleet Castle at Larne, three-quarters of the fishing rights on the Bann, and church lands, including the priory of Coleraine, were removed from MacDonnell, leaving him 333,907 acres stretching from Larne to Coleraine. Dunluce was returned to him in 1615. <br>
<br>About 1604 MacDonnell married Alice (<i>b</i>. 1582/3, <i>d</i>. in or after 1663), Tyrone's daughter with his second wife, Siobh&aacute;n (or Joanna). He was acquitted of complicity in the &#145;flight of the earls&#146; in 1607, and is notable for avoiding the embroilments which caused the flight or arrest of most Ulster chieftains by 1610, leaving almost six counties available for the plantation. This collapse of Gaelic society left MacDonnell as the greatest landowner in Ulster. He dealt astutely with the settlers, selling 2000 acres around Coleraine to the Irish Society and supplying them with building lime free of charge. In consequence he became an alderman, received a townhouse as a &#145;retreat for his life&#146;, and avoided further territorial encroachments. <br>
<br>In 1614 Alexander and Sorley, the elder sons of Sir James MacDonnell, plotted with certain dispossessed Ulster families to overthrow the new order. The conspiracy failed, and Sorley fled into exile. MacDonnell broke discontent by generosity: he brought up Sorley's son in his household, and granted Alexander 15,000 acres. Long leases for large tracts of land were made to MacDonnell kinsmen, other highland families which had come to Antrim in the sixteenth century, and important local septs. Simultaneously he gave much land to incoming lowland Scots. Rabbit warrens, deer parks, salt pans, quarries, manor courts, and markets were established, and the horse collar and heavy plough, previously unknown in Gaelic Ulster, were introduced. There was also extensive building, initiated both by himself and by leading tenants. Fortified dwellings in a distinctly Scottish style, mills, roads, townships, bridges, and imposing residences at Dunluce and Glenarm were erected. His foster family, the Stewarts, became tenants and land agents, as did his Scottish cousins the MacNaughtens. Their understanding of developing Scottish society must have aided this transition from traditional Gaelic society into a modern monetary economy. <br>
<br>MacDonnell inherited lands on Kintyre from his brother, lost them in 1607, attempted to acquire Islay about 1613, and again in 1627, and to buy Kintyre in 1635. This probably reflects an ambition to revive the clan Donald south under his leadership. In important respects he remained strongly part of native culture: his sons were brought up in the &#145;highland manner&#146;, wearing neither hats nor shoes, and speaking Irish; he gave estates to two bards who composed poetry and legally useful documents for him; and he was a staunch, if discreet, Catholic, erecting on his lands three churches for the Church of Ireland but only a chapel for the Franciscans. However, he also built chapels at the Catholic shrines of Brideswell, co. Roscommon, and Lough Derg, co. Donegal, to which he made pilgrimages, and validated the presence of priests on his lands by declaring them his chaplains. He supported a Franciscan mission to the western isles, and gave &pound;300 to their Louvain college when his illegitimate son Daniel became its guardian. <br>
<br>Two other illegitimate sons also joined the Franciscans at Louvain, while a fourth, Maurice, followed MacDonnell's nephew Sorley into the O'Neill regiment in Spanish Flanders. Links were thus maintained with the exiled Irish, and MacDonnell's two legitimate sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17462/', "Randal MacDonnell, the future marquess of Antrim")</script>, and his younger brother Alexander, toured the continent extensively before spending many years at the Stuart court, while an illegitimate daughter, Alice, married Sir Phelim O'Neill's brother, both men becoming prominent rebels in the 1640s. MacDonnell, however, always avoided confrontation with the authorities, and was anxious that his legitimate sons should be integrated members of Stuart society, encouraging them to find wealthy English or Scottish wives. <br>
<br>MacDonnell was created Viscount Dunluce on 28 May 1618 and earl of Antrim on 12 December 1620. He died at Dunluce on 10 December 1636 and was buried at Bonamargey Abbey, Ballycastle. His will divided the estate between his legitimate sons. Randal inherited the baronies of Dunluce and Kilconway, and Alexander that of Glenarm. His five legitimate daughters were left &pound;2800 each. Three married into important Old English Catholic families of the pale: Anne married Christopher Nugent, Viscount Devlin, then William Fleming, nineteenth Baron Slane; Mary married Lucas, Viscount Dillon, then Oliver Plunket, sixth Baron Louth; Catherine married Edward Plunket of Castlecor, co. Meath. By contrast Sarah, the third daughter, married Neale Oge O'Neill of Killileagh, then Sir Charles O'Connor Sligo, then Donald MacCarthy More. The youngest, Rose, married in 1642 Colonel George Gordon, brother to the earl of Sutherland, who had come to Antrim that year with the invading covenanting army. He helped her brother Randal escape from imprisonment at Carrickfergus in 1643. <br>
<br>MacDonnell's career was highly unusual. Unlike Tyrone and many others, he successfully made the transition from chieftain to modernizing landowner. At his death, astonishingly, he left no significant debts. James I expressed his administration's general satisfaction when he remarked that MacDonnell's &#145;civil and orderly life&#146; allowed the &#145;reformation and civilising of those rude parts&#146; of Ulster  (James I to Chichester, 6 May 1613, BL, Add. MS 4794, fol. 233).<br>
