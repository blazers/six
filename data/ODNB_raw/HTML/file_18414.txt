<span class="headword">Maxwell,  William</span>  (1732&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, born on 24 August 1732, was the eldest son of John Maxwell, of Falkland, in Donagh parish, co. Monaghan, archdeacon of Clogher (1762&#150;83), and his first wife, Isabella, daughter of the Revd John Leavens of Ardee, co. Louth. He was admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was elected scholar in 1750 and graduated BA (1752), MA (1755), and BD and DD (1777)  (Todd, 381). His health suffered through study, and he travelled abroad with his relative Lord Farnham, until it improved. About 1754 he was introduced to Samuel Johnson by George Grierson, the government printer at Dublin. For several years he was assistant preacher at the Temple Church, London, when the Revd Gregory Sharpe was master; in 1775, through the influence of his relative Henry Maxwell, bishop of Meath, he obtained the rectory of Mount Temple, co. Westmeath. On his return to Ireland, Johnson, who had been for many years his &#145;social friend&#146;, and always &#145;spoke of him with a very kind regard&#146;, took an affecting leave of him. Maxwell's house at Falkland was of considerable size, with a good library, the relics of which were preserved at Trough Lodge, the seat of the Ancketills. When Maxwell was required to reside more regularly on his benefice, he resigned the rectory, and about 1780 moved to Bath, allowing the house at Falkland to fall into ruins.<br>
<br>Maxwell's first wife was Anne, eldest daughter of William Burrell Massingberd, of Ormsby, Lincolnshire, whom he married on 6 December 1777, and with whom he had four children. Three of them died childless; the youngest, Anne, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17302/', "Henry Francis Lyte")</script> at Queen Square Chapel, Bath, on 21 January 1818, and died at Berry Head, Brixham, Devon, on 7 January 1856. Maxwell's first wife died at Bath, and some time later he married in Ireland Miss Jane Ellis; they had no children. Maxwell died at his home in Bennett Street, Bath, on 3 September 1818, and was buried in Walcot church, where his widow erected to his memory an enormous monument, with the family escutcheon and the motto, &#145;Je suis pr&ecirc;t&#146;. She died, aged eighty-two, on 21 May 1847, and was buried by her husband's side. Maxwell left by his will bequests for the better education of the poor at Donagh; on the old schoolhouse at Glaslough in that parish was placed an inscription to the effect that it was built in 1821 from his last designs.<br>
<br>Maxwell was very proud of his friendship with Johnson, copying him &#145;in wig, general appearance, and in manner&#146;. He furnished Boswell with considerable collectanea (in which some of the doctor's best sayings are embodied) on Johnson's life before 1770. The greater part of them were inserted in Boswell (1st edn, 1.336&#150;45), but some further anecdotes were given by him in the additions to the second edition. He is said to have written some political pamphlets, one on the Falkland Islands, and another addressed to Pitt on taxation as it affected Ireland.<br>
