<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Preston,  John</span>  (1587&#150;1628), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Upper Heyford, Northamptonshire, in October 1587 and baptized at the parish church of Bugbrook on 27 October, the son of Thomas Preston, a farmer, and his wife, Alice, daughter of Lawrence Marsh of Northampton. His father died before Preston was thirteen, but his mother's rich uncle, Cresswell, who was childless, took a liking to him, and sent him to the free school in Northampton.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsatCambridge"></a>Early years at Cambridge</h2>After further tuition in Bedfordshire, Preston on 5 July 1604 matriculated as a sizar from King's College, Cambridge. There he also studied music with particular devotion to the lute. Unhappy in this, he moved in 1606 to Queens' College, where he studied natural philosophy and graduated BA early in 1608. A business venture, for which he had sold land inherited from Cresswell, came to nothing, and so he returned to Aristotelian philosophy. What became a characteristic strictness of life emerged early: his tutor reprimanded him for excessive studying to the neglect of his body. However, he was rewarded in 1609 with a fellowship of the college.<br>
<br>In 1610 Preston was made a lay prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral, an office he held until his death. However, at this time he had no intention of seeking ecclesiastical preferment and, according to Thomas Ball, writing later as one of his devoted disciples, Preston &#145;thought it below him to be a minister, &amp; held the study of Divinity to be a kind of honest silliness&#146;  (Ball, 7). Instead, he turned to the study of medicine and astrology. He proceeded MA in 1611. However, about 1611 or 1612 &#145;as he was in the Caelestial contemplations&#146;, he was rudely awakened by the &#145;hotter sort of Protestant&#146;  (ibid., 16). When John Cotton preached a plain, evangelical university sermon in Great St Mary's, it met with widespread disapproval from an audience seeking more ostentatious rhetoric, and Cotton returned dejected to his fellow's accommodation in Emmanuel College. Suddenly, however, Preston &#145;knocks at his door, and coming in, acquaints him with his spiritual condition, and how it had pleased God to speak effectually unto his heart by that Sermon&#146;  (J. Norton, <span class="italic">Abel being Dead yet Speaketh</span>, 1658, 14). Not only did Preston and Cotton become lifelong friends, but Preston's view of the Christian ministry and the study of divinity was transformed, and soon he was immersing himself in the works of the schoolmen, delighted to find there so frequently quoted his old friend Aristotle. He was ordained deacon in the diocese of Peterborough on 19 June, and priest on 20 June 1614.<h2>
<a name="Courtcontactsandthequestionofconformity"></a>Court contacts and the question of conformity</h2>Soon afterwards Preston began to attract notice outside Cambridge. Samuel Harsnett, master of Pembroke College and vice-chancellor of the university, prevailed upon him to engage in a public philosophical disputation at Cambridge before King James in March 1615. Preston excelled and gained the king's favour, debating the question as to &#145;whether Dogs could make syllogismes&#146;  (Ball, 23). However, when Preston was offered a place at court he declined. This indifference to the allurements of the court offended many, and a few suspected that &#145;some inclination to puritanisme&#146; lay behind his reserve  (ibid., 29), but at this point no tangible evidence seems to have been given in support of the charge, other than his opposition to one of his pupils appearing in a stage play as a woman.<br>
<br>Five years later, however, Preston nearly lost his place at Queens' owing to accusations of being &#145;a Non-Conformist&#146; and &#145;an enimy to formes of Prayer&#146;  (Ball, 45, 53). On 23 January 1620 he clashed with Robert Newcome, commissary of the archdeacon of Ely, and with Lancelot Andrewes, recently departed bishop of Ely, over his failure to use the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> at a lecture in St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, and his preaching a sermon when explicitly forbidden to do so by Newcome. Yet Preston reaffirmed his full allegiance to the prayer book at St Botolph's, in what was made to be seen as an enforced recantation sermon, and he signed a written apology to Newcome. He thereby evaded the moves by Andrewes to have him expelled from the university. As if to play to both galleries, Preston in this sermon endorsed set forms of prayer and extempore prayer as each being useful in its own place. Preaching before James I at Hinchingbrooke that year, as is clear from the more reliable 1644 edition of the sermon <span class="italic">Plenitudo fontis</span>, he delivered what was largely anti-Arminian polemic, but towards the end he obliged with a defence of liturgical prayer, and an exhortation to obey the commands of the church. Both aspects of the sermon pleased the king.<br>
<br>John Hacket, later bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, claimed Preston was &#145;not well affected to the Church&#146; and was &#145;zealous for a new Discipline, and given to Change&#146;; he wanted the marquess of Buckingham to help him &#145;strenuously lop off from this half-reformed Church, the superfluous Branches of Romish Superstition, that much disfigured it&#146;  (Hacket, <span class="italic">Scrinia reserata</span>, 1693, 1.203). However, writing in the 1650s, Hacket cited no sources for this narrative, and its accuracy is impossible to assess. Preston was indeed close to Buckingham, and the effect of this and other contacts is evident from the fact that the St Botolph's incident did nothing to hinder his rapid promotion: Sir Fulke Greville, among others, became his patron, strategic contacts at court continued, and his reputation as a theologian grew.<br>
<br>Later in 1620 Preston proceeded BD, and he soon became dean and catechist at Queens'. The longest item in Preston's manuscript legacy&#151;a system of theology as taught to his Cambridge pupils&#151;dates from about this time (Emmanuel College, Cambridge, MS 181). It has been suggested that Preston's anti-papal activities extended to writing, if only in a joint-authorship capacity, one of the most outspoken tracts against the Spanish match, possibly that known as &#145;Mr Alured's&#146; letter against the Spanish match, numerous copies of which survive. On 9 May 1621 James Ussher, then vice-chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, chose Preston as professor of theological controversies there but, having deliberated until 20 July, Preston declined. But he did not refuse another offer that same year to enter the court, and was made chaplain-in-ordinary to Prince Charles, thanks to his sermon before the king and his relationship with Buckingham.<h2>
<a name="Preacherpastorandabsenteeacademic"></a>Preacher, pastor, and absentee academic</h2>On 21 May 1622 Preston was elected to succeed John Donne as preacher to the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn, where he officiated regularly for the rest of his life. He exerted a considerable influence through this prestigious congregation, and even the newly rebuilt chapel was soon bursting at the seams. On 3 October, following a legal but hurried and secret election behind locked gates, Preston was also admitted master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. His court connections gave Emmanuel the prestige it needed to offset its growing notoriety as a subversive &#145;puritan&#146; institution. Yet Preston later fell out of favour with the fellows who had elected him, because he was so absorbed with court affairs that he had little time to bring in the reforms to the college statutes that the fellows were expecting. His predecessor, Laurence Chaderton, may have continued to discharge many of the master's functions.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Preston had caught the eye of Arthur, Lord Chichester, who in 1623 requested the king for the company of Preston on his proposed mission to Cologne to negotiate an end to war in the Palatinate. Chichester, Sir Edward Conway, and Buckingham then obtained for Preston, through a personal mandate of the king dated 15 July, a degree of DD, conferred on 17 July. It was thought improper for a master of a university college to be seen abroad without one.<br>
<br>About this time Preston turned down an offer of the deanery of Westminster, seeing it as no use for the cause of &#145;the godly&#146;. His desire to place a higher priority on preaching than on financial gain was very evident in 1624 when the lectureship at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, became vacant. By now suspicious of the use Preston would make of such a position, the king and bishops not only promised Paul Micklethwaite, fellow of Sidney Sussex, a reward if he would campaign for it, but also tried to deflect Preston with an offer of any bishopric or other preferment he desired. This ploy failed, not because of any stated unease on Preston's part with the episcopal office itself&#151;indeed, he maintained close and enduring friendships with numerous bishops&#151;but rather because he believed that God's cause was better served in other spheres. His heart was set on preaching, and he was finally confirmed lecturer at Trinity by Nicholas Felton, bishop of Ely, amid much controversy and opposition from the vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>Preston's ministry there and elsewhere had a significant impact, including influencing ordinary people. Many attributed their spiritual awakening to his preaching, among them Thomas Shepard of New England fame. Furthermore, although Preston was never given a cure of souls, he was much sought after as a spiritual counsellor concerning the inward motions of the human heart. His most demanding service in this area was probably the infamous case of Joan Drake, who in the early 1620s was understood to be in the grip of Satan and suicidal until she was apparently delivered through the prolonged counselling of Preston, John Dod, Thomas Hooker, and James Ussher. Preston also had close and long-lasting friendships with those renowned for a more defiant stance towards their mother church. He may or may not have shared the nonconformist tenets of Cotton or Arthur Hildersam, but he was sufficiently behind them to negotiate their liberty to preach again after they had been silenced in the 1610s and 1620s.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>By the mid-1620s Preston had reached the peak of his career. It seems fair to say that theological concerns overrode his more natural inclinations to prolong this period of political favour. In April 1625 Joseph Mede could still describe Preston as &#145;a man in speciall favour with the king&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 389, fol. 428), and for a while Buckingham continued to seek his preferment. That year he nominated Preston for the newly vacant position of lord keeper, although Sir Thomas Coventry, formerly of Emmanuel College, finally received the post. However, Buckingham was quietly undergoing a change of allegiance in an anti-Calvinist direction. At the York House conference in February 1626 Preston played a leading if, to his supporters, disappointing role, but Richard Mountague, accused of popery and Arminianism, escaped the clutches of his would-be oppressors, and Buckingham's new agenda became clear to Preston. He committed to writing his new assessment of the duke and court politics in general but the letter fell into the hands of Sir Henry Spiller, who alerted the duke. A wedge was driven between him and Preston, and the latter's influence at court began to wane, so much so that he even considered escaping to Basel. But Preston remained in England and, although direct evidence is lacking, it is probable that he went on to become a key leader behind the formation in 1626 of the feoffees for impropriations, who aimed to gather endowments for the establishment of preaching ministries.<br>
<br>Soon after this Preston's health began to fail. On 27 May 1628 Richard Sibbes, fellow feoffee and preacher at Gray's Inn, wrote to Ussher, now archbishop of Armagh, informing him that Preston was &#145;inclining to a consumption&#146; (probably tuberculosis) and that his state was &#145;thought doubtful to the physicians&#146;  (J. Ussher, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1864, 16.522). Preston spent his last months travelling to see friends, hoping that the country air would do him good. He finally returned to his home county of Northamptonshire and to his friend Sir Richard Knightley at Fawsley, enabling him to renew his fellowship with Dod, who prayed with him on his deathbed. He was also visited by Chaderton and Lord Saye and Sele. At five o'clock in the morning on 20 July, Preston died at Knightley's home in Fawsley&#151;a bachelor, and just short of his forty-first birthday. He was buried on 28 July in Fawsley parish church, intentionally without elaborate ceremony. Dod preached the funeral sermon, &#145;and a world of Godly people came together&#146;  (Ball, 175). Preston's will, made on 30 July 1618 and proved on 30 July 1628, was indicative both of that world and of his primary concerns. Beneficiaries included Chichester, Saye and Sele (his executor), Dod, Sibbes, Cotton, Hooker, and other &#145;godly preachers&#146;, with &pound;50 going to Queens' College. A codicil left &pound;200 to Emmanuel College to support two poor scholars.<h2>
<a name="Legacyandreputation"></a>Legacy and reputation</h2>Undoubtedly Preston's greatest legacy was the subsequent flood of published editions of his sermons, through which he continued to have a great influence on &#145;the godly&#146; in England and New England. His works, all published posthumously, comprise mainly sermonic as opposed to systematic material, and were critical in establishing a new spiritual genre of protestant devotional publications, through Dutch-language editions among others. When Lord Saye and Sele visited him on his deathbed, Preston chose four men as his editors, Sibbes and John Davenport for his Lincoln's Inn sermons, and Thomas Goodwin and Ball for all his other sermons. Collections of the former first appeared as <span class="italic">The New Covenant</span> (1629); a treatise on prayer, <span class="italic">The Saints Daily Exercise</span> (1629); <span class="italic">The Breast-Plate of Faith and Love</span> (1630); and <span class="italic">The Saints Qualification</span> (1633). The other authorized collections of sermons were <span class="italic">The Golden Scepter</span> (1638); a series on indwelling sin, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Saints Infirmities</span> (1636); an incomplete treatise on the divine attributes, <span class="italic">Life Eternall</span> (1631); and an important collection of court sermons, <span class="italic">Sermons Preached before his Majestie</span> (1630). To the dismay of the authorized editors, twice as many titles in Preston's name were to come from unauthorized editors, who included Preston's great admirer William Prynne. The unauthorized editions are not inherently or generally unreliable, however, although <span class="italic">The Fulnesse of Christ for Us</span> (1639, 1640) was purged to make it appear that Preston had not preached against Arminianism before the king; the 1644 edition, <span class="italic">Plenitudo fontis</span>, corrects this. Other more important unauthorized publications include: a treatise on the sovereignty of grace, <span class="italic">Irresistibilitate gratiae convertentis</span> (1639; English translation, 1654); <span class="italic">Remaines</span> (1634); a thorough treatment of the mortification of sin, <span class="italic">Sins Overthrow</span> (1633); and a collection of assorted sermons, <span class="italic">Riches of Mercy</span> (1658), the last of Preston's works to be published in the seventeenth century. This brought the total number of editions of his material to over 100.<br>
<br>In terms of theology he has often been misrepresented, but his printed legacy reveals that the mature Preston embraced the system of English hypothetical universalism. This was a modified and moderate form of Calvinism, which he had learned from Ussher and Bishop John Davenant in reaction to rigorous Elizabethan particularism (which he seems to have once held) and which arose from the perceived need for a Reformed and Lutheran consensus in the light of a rising Arminianism. He held that in one sense Christ died for all without exception, and that God desires to save all hearers in the preaching of the gospel. He was a self-conscious and influential covenant theologian, and promoted a greater emphasis on human responsibility in the covenant relationship. His evangelical impulse led him to attack the formalism he saw in the state church, and dominant themes in his preaching were preparation for salvation, the quest for full assurance of faith, and the need for thorough self-examination prior to partaking of the Lord's supper.<br>
<br>Preston's relationship to the established church remains more elusive. He has been described as &#145;one of the more enigmatic figures in the history of religion, and of politics&#146;  (Bendall, Brooke, and Collinson, 215). In the historiography of dissent, by 1702 Preston was being heralded as &#145;one of the greatest Men in his Age&#146;  (C. Mather, <span class="italic">Marginalia Christi Americana</span>, 1702, 3.16); there was &#145;scarcely an eminent Puritan divine of fifty years after Preston's death who does not refer to him as one of the greatest authorities&#146;  (Hill, 244). He later became enshrined as a &#145;sufferer for nonconformity&#146;  (D. Neal, <span class="italic">History of the Puritans</span>, 1822, 2.128). Yet this was without evidence: Thomas Fuller gave no grounds for styling Preston as the &#145;Patriarch of the Presbyterian Party&#146;  (T. Fuller, <span class="italic">The Church-History of Britain</span>, 1655, pt 11, 131). Preston nowhere seems to have spoken against episcopacy, and neither does there appear to be any surviving evidence of his attitude to vestments or the signing of the cross in baptism.<br>
<br>On the other hand, Preston shows himself to have been definitely the &#145;hotter sort of Protestant&#146;. The zeal of his youth continued into his later preaching and Heylyn singled him out as a renowned sabbatarian. His plain-style preaching was on occasions militantly anti-papal and anti-Arminian, and his court sermons frequently addressed the contemporary political scene; Fuller thought him a &#145;perfect Politician&#146; of the utmost cunning  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.291). At the same time, his works are almost entirely consumed with matters of spiritual experience and practical piety. As an exemplary &#145;experimental predestinarian&#146; and as a member of the spiritual brotherhood who pursued this approach to piety, Preston was indeed a puritan. In regard to outward conformity, or rather lack of it, he was a moderate or a fully conforming puritan. But this does not imply that he was complacent about the ecclesiastical <i>status quo</i>, for in that sense he was a conforming reformer.<br>
