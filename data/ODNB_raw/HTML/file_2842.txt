<span class="headword">Bonh&ocirc;te <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mapes]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1744&#150;1818), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Earsham Street, Bungay, Suffolk, and baptized on 11 April 1744 in St Mary's Church, Bungay, the elder of two surviving children of James Mapes (<i>bap</i>. 1714, <i>d</i>. 1794), baker and grocer of Bungay, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Galliard (<i>d</i>. 1789). Her first work, a novel entitled <span class="italic">Hortensia, or, The Distressed Wife</span>, was published anonymously in 1769. On 13 October 1772 she married Daniel Bonh&ocirc;te (1748/9&#150;1804), a solicitor of Bungay, later an under-sheriff of Suffolk and captain of the 2nd company of Bungay Volunteers. In that same year she published her second novel <span class="italic">The Rambles of Mr Frankly, Published by his Sister</span> (2 vols.). A moralizing tale influenced by Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Sentimental Journey</span> (1768), it describes how Frankly learns contentment from observing the lives of various classes of people during strolls in Hyde Park. Immediately popular, it was translated into German at Leipzig, later published in Dublin and Paris, and reprinted with additions by the Minerva Press in 1797. Illness following the birth of her three children between 1773 and 1777 prevented further publications from appearing until <span class="italic">Olivia, or, The Deserted Bride</span> in 1787. Her next work, and another best-seller, was an educational guide, <span class="italic">The Parental Monitor</span> (2 vols. published by subscription, 1788): it consists of a series of short, moral essays addressed to children, and enlivened by quotations and illustrative stories. It ran to three editions, and was published in Dublin and posthumously in the USA.<br>
<br>In total, Elizabeth Bonh&ocirc;te published seven fictional works, all of which reflected the contemporary taste for novels of sentiment and sensibility, combining &#145;a reaction against coarseness, preoccupation with conventional morality and a strong bent towards emotionalism&#146;  (MacCarthy, 31&#150;64). They appealed to a growing female readership catered for by the circulating libraries. In particular <span class="italic">Darnley Vale, or, Emelia Fitzroy</span> (1789) and <span class="italic">Ellen Woodley</span> (1790) were favourably noticed in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> (February 1790, 223; July 1790, 351). In 1791 her husband purchased the site of Bungay Castle. Its ruined grandeur and fabled history appealed to her imagination and inspired her final novel, a Gothic romance entitled <span class="italic">Bungay Castle</span> (1796). Featuring the popular ingredients of a handsome hero imprisoned in a dungeon, a fair heroine of acute sensibility, secret passages, and ghostly hauntings, it confirmed her position as one of the Minerva Press's best-selling authors. In 1804 her husband died during a residence at Bury. Throughout her life she had published occasional verse and her last production was the anonymous <span class="italic">Feeling, or, Sketches from Life: a Desultory Poem</span> (1810). She died at Bungay on 11 June 1818 aged seventy-four. Her generous will left dwelling houses, a baking office, and shop in Bungay, and approximately &pound;3500 in cash and annuities. No portrait of her is known, and little has been recorded about her appearance or personality; but her husband in his will dated 1792 referred to the &#145;excellency of her head and heart&#146;, a tribute which seems justly confirmed by her writings.<br>
