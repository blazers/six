<span class="headword">John Trevor <span class="st"> [Si&ocirc;n Trefor]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1410/1412), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was a native of Powys. He was educated at Oxford, becoming BCL in 1381 and doctor of civil and canon law by 1389. Between 1382 and 1391 he accumulated canonries and prebends in the dioceses of St Asaph, St David's, Wells, Hereford, and Lincoln, often by papal provision. In the meantime, on a vacancy's occurring (December 1389) in the see of St Asaph, John was elected by the chapter and obtained a royal licence (2 March 1390) to go to Rome to secure the pope's confirmation of their choice. But Urban VI had, as he feared, already appointed Alexander Bach to the post. He settled at Rome as auditor of causes and papal chaplain, and was more fortunate when St Asaph again fell vacant in August 1394; the chapter once more elected him, and Boniface IX issued a provision in his favour. He was consecrated at Rome on 17 April 1395. As bishop he was known for his sumptuous court and table and for his patronage of Welsh poetry. The greatest contemporary Welsh poet, Iolo Goch, addressed two odes (<i>cywyddau</i>) to him.<br>
<br>Richard II employed John in negotiations with Scotland in 1397&#150;9, and in discussions about the schism. But the bishop was one of the first to desert him, thereby obtaining from Henry Bolingbroke the post of chamberlain of Chester and Flint (16 August 1399) even before Richard was actually a prisoner. The captive king handed John the seals at Lichfield on 24 August &#145;in the presence of Henry, duke of Lancaster&#146;, who, after his accession, confirmed him in the post (1 November 1399), which he retained until 1404.<br>
<br>John was a member of the parliamentary commission which pronounced sentence of deposition on Richard in September 1399, and he read the sentence in full parliament before Henry took his seat on the vacant throne. After a mission to Spain to announce Henry's accession to his brother-in-law, Enrique III of Castile, John accompanied the English army into Scotland in August 1400. In February 1401 he allegedly warned parliament of the danger of driving Glyn D&#373;r and the Welsh to extremes, but his comments were treated dismissively. His protest was no doubt sharpened by the exposed position of his diocese. His revenues, impaired by the rebellion, had to be made up a few months later by a licence to hold <i>in commendam</i> the church of Meifod with the chapels of Welshpool and Guilsfield. He acted as the prince of Wales's deputy in north Wales in the early months of 1402, and on 22 April 1403 the prince made him his lieutenant for Chester and Flint. He came to the prince's muster before Shrewsbury at the head of ten esquires and forty archers, and probably fought on the winning side in that battle on 23 July 1403. But his loyalty was shaken when the Welsh burnt his cathedral, palace, and three of his manor houses. Reduced to poverty, he was aggrieved that the king did nothing for him directly, and, refusing to be dependent on the bounty of the archbishop of Canterbury, he stole away in the summer of 1404 and joined Glyn D&#373;r. His goods were seized and the chamberlainship was granted to Thomas Barneby. He was deprived of the temporalities of his see by royal command on 27 August 1405; but the proposal to transfer him to the see of St Andrews was aborted. He was granted the revenues of up to four benefices in the diocese of Rheims in July 1410 to make good the loss of income from his diocese.<br>
<br>On joining Glyn D&#373;r's cause, John became one of the rebel leader's most active and influential supporters. He was sent to co-ordinate policies with Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, in July 1405 and subsequently fled with the earl to Scotland. According to Adam of Usk, he was dispatched twice to France to raise military support for the Welsh cause. Given his international standing and diplomatic experience, he may well have played a key part in drafting the most ambitious political and ecclesiastical policies of Owain Glyn D&#373;r in 1405&#150;6, including the Tripartite Indenture and the switch of allegiance to the Avignon papacy.<br>
<br>According to Adam of Usk John died in Rome on 5 October 1412; but some historians have suggested that the epitaph to &#145;John bishop of Hereford [<i>sic</i>] in Wales&#146; in the infirmary chapel of the abbey of St Victor in Paris commemorates John Trevor's death there in April 1410. It has been claimed that John Trevor was the author of a treatise on heraldry, which he also translated into Welsh, and of the life of St Martin, as well as of other historical works; but there is no conclusive evidence that this was so. He is not infrequently confused with his namesake, John Trevor or Trefor, who preceded him as bishop of St Asaph, 1346&#150;57.<br>
