<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nairne,  Alexander</span>  (1863&#150;1936), <span class="occ">theologian and biblical scholar</span>, was born at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 17 January 1863, the eldest child of Spencer Nairne, rector of Hunsdon, and his wife, Marion Walker, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18144/', "John Marshall, first Lord Curriehill")</script>, and sister of John Marshall, second Lord Curriehill, both Scottish judges. His ancestors for several generations were Scottish ministers.<br>
<br>Nairne was educated at Haileybury School and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar. He obtained first classes in the classical (1884) and theological (1886) triposes, two university prizes, and a university scholarship. He was a fellow of Jesus from 1887 to 1893 and again from 1917 to 1932, in which year he was elected an honorary fellow. He was ordained deacon in 1887 and priest in 1888, and was curate of Great St Mary's and vice-principal of the Clergy Training School at Cambridge from 1887 to 1889. In 1889 he married Ethel (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter of Lambert Campbell Edwards, vicar of Kingsbury, Middlesex. They had no children, and Nairne was celibate for at least some, and perhaps all, of his married life. After his marriage, Nairne worked successively as an assistant master at Harrow School (1890&#150;92), curate of Hadleigh, Suffolk (1892&#150;4), and rector of Tewin, Hertfordshire (1894&#150;1912).<br>
<br>From 1900 to 1917 Nairne was professor of Hebrew and <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> exegesis at King's College, London, where he was able to demonstrate his real talents for the first time. His lectures, which combined information with poetic and mystical insights, were very popular. He also helped to gain for the &#145;higher criticism&#146; of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, already well established on the continent, a popular hearing in England. This &#145;higher&#146; criticism, which sought to apply form, source, and redaction criticism to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the hope of establishing a historically accurate description of its composition and authorship, had long been treated with suspicion in English universities. But Nairne was able to convey its message in a way which did not appear to harm the religious faith of his students.<br>
<br>From 1914 to 1922 Nairne was a canon of Chester Cathedral, where the stimulating effect of his scholarship and his personality was warmly welcomed. In 1917 he returned to Cambridge as fellow and dean of Jesus College; he was vicar of All Saints' Church until 1919, and was made Hulsean lecturer at the University of Cambridge in 1919&#150;20, and regius professor of divinity from 1922, a year after his wife's death, to 1932.<br>
<br>Nairne ignored university politics and the business of the theology faculty, finding them of no interest; but he had a wide personal influence upon undergraduates and dons alike. His lectures were found stimulating and inspiring by many, though those who sought easy answers to examination questions were apt to be disappointed. His scholarship, love of literature, and his interest in artists, poets, as well as men of science, made his influence wide. He treated all undergraduates as his intellectual equals, and was generous in his assessments of supposed infidels such as the poet Shelley, the philosopher J. M. E. McTaggart, and James Frazer, author of <span class="italic">The Golden Bough</span>, who he thought were in touch with spiritual realities and therefore almost good Christians. He formed a society for undergraduates called the Clouds, which met once a week in his own rooms to read Plato. These sessions were crowded and, after some years, a book to which all had contributed and which was inscribed to <i>Nephel&#275;gereta</i> (as used by Homer of Zeus, namely, &#145;cloudgatherer&#146;) was presented to him by the members of the Clouds.<br>
<br>Nairne's books were not written for specialists but contained much fine scholarship and insight. Pedants were apt to be a touch scornful of his popular and accessible style, Hebraists saying that he did not know his grammar, and the &#145;higher&#146; critics that he made no contribution to their studies. It was true that Nairne was suspicious of the work of the higher critics, but his scholarly instincts, poetic sense, and religious piety made his opinions valued by many. His intellectual honesty meant that he saw more deeply than most. His book on the epistle to the <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>, <span class="italic">The Epistle of Priesthood</span> (1913), his Hulsean lectures, <span class="italic">The Faith of the New Testament</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">The Life Eternal: Here and Now</span> in particular represent his characteristic style.<br>
<br>Nairne was a canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor, from 1921 until his death, which took place at his home, The Cloisters, Windsor Castle, on 15 March 1936. In 1931 the University of St Andrews had conferred upon him the honorary degree of DD.<br>
<br>Uninterested in worldly affairs, Nairne was a man of radiant charm and kindness, of alertness, of sympathy, of a goodness which compelled almost all who met him not only to like him but to love him. He gave away every penny earned from his canonry, though he left effects to the value of over &pound;6000 after his death. An etching by Francis Dodd of 1933, the only known portrait of Nairne, was left to Jesus College, Cambridge.<br>
