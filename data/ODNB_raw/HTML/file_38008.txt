<span class="headword">Stewart,  William Arnold</span>  (1882&#150;1953), <span class="occ">exponent of modern technical education in the Middle East and painter</span>, was born on 17 July 1882 in Ilkley, Yorkshire, the youngest of four children (two sons and two daughters) of John Reich Stewart, who was of Scottish descent, and his wife, Naamah Arnold, who was from Yorkshire. He was trained at Bradford Technical College and the Royal College of Art, and was employed as a textile designer in Bradford until 1911, when he took up a post as inspector of arts and crafts in the Egyptian ministry of education in Cairo. In 1918, at the invitation of Ronald Storrs, the military governor of Jerusalem, he was seconded for several months to Palestine to advise on the renewal of crafts and light industries destroyed during the war, and worked closely with C. R. Ashbee, the governor's civil adviser and secretary to the Pro-Jerusalem Society. In 1919 or 1920 Stewart married in Cairo Kathleen Margaret, daughter of Henry Cleveland Beardshaw, a stockbroker. They had two daughters and a son. He returned to Palestine in 1922 to participate in the work of the Palestine crafts and industries commission.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1927 Stewart, like many other British officials, was retired from the Egyptian government service. In September of the same year he started working with Dr George Andrew Reisner, director of the Harvard&#150;Boston expedition, on the restoration of the furniture of Queen Hetep-heres, the mother of King Khufu (2560&#150;2537 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>), discovered at Giza by Alan Rowe two years earlier. Stewart's workshop was a mud-brick hut near the pyramids where he worked with his two Egyptian assistants. Many of the tools had to be made on the spot specially for the task. The reconstruction of all the objects could not be completed (this was later achieved by Bernard Rice and Ahmad Youssef Moustafa) because of Stewart's appointment as supervisor of technical education in Palestine in 1930, but his name remains connected with the first attempt in Egyptian archaeology to restore objects which the loss of wood reduced to a mass of precious metal and faience components. The restored objects are on display in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.<br>
<br>In his new post Stewart displayed enthusiasm and flair. He personally was responsible for the instruction of many young Arab teachers in drawing, design, and handicraft, and for the introduction of these subjects to schools. He was actively involved in the preservation and revival of local crafts such as glass-blowing, leather-work, dyeing, spinning, and weaving, and maintained contacts with craftsmen in various parts of Palestine. He was never patronizing, and freely admitted that &#145;if I taught them anything, I certainly learnt (as) much by watching them at work.&#146; He helped to establish the Palestine Conservatoire of Music and was chairman of its board of directors (1932&#150;47). In July 1942 he was appointed technical adviser to the controller of light industries in Palestine.<br>
<br>Stewart was a versatile artist; painting was his lifelong passion and his pictures can serve as a guide to his career. In 1915 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. His <span class="italic">Feast of Nebi Musa</span>, showing a Muslim public procession near Jericho, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1938. In 1947 Stewart retired and went to live in High Wycombe. He died there at his home, 26 Lucas Road, on 18 January 1953.<br>
