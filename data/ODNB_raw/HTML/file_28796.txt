<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warton,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1722, <em>d.</em> 1800), <span class="occ">poet and literary critic</span>, elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28798/', "Thomas Warton (1688&#150;1745)")</script>, clergyman and poet, and his wife, Elizabeth Richardson (1691&#150;1762), was born at Dunsfold, Surrey, and baptized there on 22 April 1722, at the vicarage of his grandfather Joseph Richardson. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28799/', "Thomas Warton")</script>, was also a poet and historian of English poetry, while his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40740/', "Jane Warton")</script> contributed (at Joseph's request) to Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Adventurer</span> and wrote a novel and a two-volume book of advice for young ladies. His early education was at the grammar school in Basingstoke where his father was headmaster, and Gilbert White a fellow pupil. On 2 August 1736 he was elected a scholar of Winchester College (although he was probably there earlier) and began a near lifelong association with it; from there he published his first poem, &#145;Sappho's Advice&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 9, October 1739, 545). Warton matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 16 January 1740 but did not take up residence until the following September. While at Oxford Warton published his first major piece of poetry: <span class="italic">Fashion: an Epistolary Satire to a Friend</span> (1742).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Warton graduated BA on 13 March 1744, the year when his most important piece of poetic work, <span class="italic">The Enthusiast, or, The Lover of Nature</span>, was published. According to Warton's publisher Robert Dodsley the work was written in 1740  (<span class="italic">A Collection of Poems in Six Volumes</span>, 1782, 3.104), and certainly it is just such a poem as an undergraduate or recent graduate would write, full of love of nature and feeling, going against the prevailing taste for poetry epitomized by Alexander Pope. It was warmly received and Warton revised and enlarged it for inclusion in later editions of Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span>.<br>
<br>Upon leaving Oxford, Warton took holy orders and became his father's curate in Basingstoke until he received the charge of Chelsea in February 1746. But after a disagreement with some parishioners and a bout of smallpox he left Chelsea and took the curacies of Droxford and Chawton in Hampshire. During this time he published a number of poems in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Museum</span> and in 1746 contemplated a project with William Collins to publish their odes together. The project never materialized as Dodsley refused Collins's poems, but he published Warton's <span class="italic">Odes on Various Subjects</span> in 1746. The &#145;Ode to Fancy&#146; became something of a contemporary favourite. In 1754 a writer in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 24, 592) felt that &#145;Fancy&#146; was proof that Warton &#145;ought not to be confined to the drudgery of translation&#146; and William Shenstone considered it the best of the odes inspired by Milton's &#145;Il penseroso&#146;.<br>
<br>In the second edition of the <span class="italic">Odes</span> is a poem by Thomas Warton the younger. The process of borrowing from and revising each other's work, begun in the <span class="italic">Odes</span>, was carried on and enlarged while the brothers were editing their father's poems. Thomas Warton the elder died on 10 September 1745, and to obtain money Joseph proposed putting together a number of his father's poems and selling them by subscription. The volume, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions, by the Reverend Mr. Thomas Warton</span>, did not, however, include poems only by their father. Both Thomas and Joseph contributed to it in their father's name and in many cases they (particularly Joseph) heavily edited many of the remaining poems.<br>
<br>On 21 September 1747 Warton married Mary Daman (<i>d</i>. 1772), with whom he eventually had six children. In the next year Charles Paulet, third duke of Bolton, granted the living of Winslade to Warton and he continued his literary career with <span class="italic">Ranelagh House: a Satire in Prose: in the Manner of Monsieur Le Sage</span>. Three years later Warton made his only trip to the continent when he accompanied the duke, who was travelling with his mistress, Lavinia Fenton, universally known as Polly Peachum for the role she had made famous in Gay's <span class="italic">Beggar's Opera</span>. The duke needed a member of the clergy to marry him to Miss Fenton should the duchess's expected death occur while he was on the continent. However, Warton left the duke's party before the duchess's death and returned home without performing the ceremony. The experience did provide him with the subject for another poem, &#145;Verses Written at Montaubon&#146; (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 24, April 1755, 183&#150;4).<br>
<br>Warton continued his literary endeavours as he worked on a translation of Virgil which was published (in both Latin and English) in four volumes in 1753. Although using Christopher Pitt's translation of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, he himself translated the <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> and the <span class="italic">Georgics</span>. About this time he made the friendship of Johnson who invited him to contribute to <span class="italic">The Adventurer</span>, Warton eventually writing nineteen or twenty of the papers signed &#145;Z&#146;, including five on Shakespeare.<h2>
<a name="Winchesteryears"></a>Winchester years</h2>In 1754 Warton became rector of Tunworth, but despairing of further advancement in the church accepted the position of usher, or second master, at his old school, Winchester, on 3 December 1755. Here he remained until his retirement in 1793, becoming headmaster in 1766. On 23 June 1759 Oxford conferred upon him the degree of MA by diploma. On 15 January 1768 he proceeded at Oxford to the degrees of BD and DD.<br>
<br>Warton's major contribution to scholarship was <span class="italic">An Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope</span> (1756; second volume, 1782; in subsequent editions the title was <span class="italic">Genius and Writings</span>). As Pope had died only twelve years earlier, it was anticipated that the work might arouse some controversy so it was published anonymously and Dodsley's name did not appear on the title-page until the second issue of the second edition (merely a reprinting of the title-page of the second edition) in 1762. The dedication to Edward Young acts somewhat as a manifesto for Warton's views. He writes in the dedication:<blockquote>No love of singularity, no affection of paradoxical opinions, gave rise to the following work. I revere the memory of Pope, I respect and honour his abilities; but I do not think him at the head of his profession. In other words, in that species of poetry wherein Pope excelled, he is superior to all mankind: and I only say, that this species of poetry is not the most excellent one of the art. (pp. iii&#150;iv)</blockquote>Warton divided poets into four classes. Into the first, those who are &#145;sublime and pathetic&#146;, he placed Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton (and curiously &#145;at proper intervals, Otway and Lee&#146;). In the second class were poets who &#145;possessed the true poetical genius, in a more moderate degree, but had noble talents for moral and ethical poesy&#146;. The third class were &#145;men of wit, of elegant taste and some fancy in describing familiar life&#146;. The fourth class were &#145;mere versifiers, however smooth and mellifluous some of them may be thought&#146;  (pp. xi&#150;xii). Warton, whose name did not appear on the title-page until the posthumous edition of 1806, placed Pope at the head of the second class of poets. The work was favourably reviewed by Johnson and went into several reprints. It also aroused some opposition&#151;most notably from Owen Ruffhead (<span class="italic">The Life of Alexander Pope</span>, 1769), and Percival Stockdale (<span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature and Genuine Laws of Poetry</span>, 1778). But most critics seemed to agree with the review in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> which described the <span class="italic">Essay</span> as &#145;a most interesting and useful miscellany of literary knowledge and candid criticism containing censure without acrimony, and praise without flattery&#146;. Johnson, writing in the <span class="italic">Literary Magazine</span>, called it &#145;a just specimen of literary moderation&#146;. Later, in the <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span> where Johnson criticized the <span class="italic">Essay</span> and defended Pope more explicitly than he had done earlier, he still said of the <span class="italic">Essay</span> that it is &#145;a book which teaches how the brow of Criticism may be smoothed, and how she may be enabled, with all her severity, to attract and to delight&#146;.<br>
<br>Warton's personality and effusive nature were well known among his friends:<blockquote>But it was a particular Felicity to meet Jo: Warton at Oxford, we had a great Joy in the meeting; He is the same ardent Creature he always was, and when we parted it had like to have cost me the Bone-setting of my right Hand. (R. Holt-White, <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Gilbert White</span>, 1901, 1 June 1757, I.121)</blockquote>In June 1785 Hannah More found him &#145;as usual, very enthusiastic and very agreeable&#146; and later labelled him &#145;that delightful enthusiast&#146;  (W. Roberts, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Hannah More</span>, 1835).<br>
<br>While Warton's &#145;enthusiasm&#146; was popular with many, it was not with Johnson, who called Warton &#145;an enthusiast by rule&#146;, although there seems to have been a close friendship between them earlier. Wooll claims an incident at Sir Joshua Reynolds's house was the cause of the coolness between them. Apparently a dispute arose to which Wooll has recorded the conclusion:<blockquote>
<div>Johnson: &#145;Sir, I am not used to be[ing] contradicted.&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>Warton: &#145;Better for yourself and your friends, Sir, if you were; our admiration could not be increased, but our love might.&#146;<br>
</div> (Wooll, 98n.)</blockquote>Wooll does not give a date to this incident but some change in the relationship had occurred by 22 January 1766 when Warton wrote to his brother:<blockquote>I only dined with Johnson, who seemed cold and indifferent, and scarce said any thing to me; perhaps he has heard what I said of his Shakespeare, or rather was offended at what I wrote to him&#151;as he pleases.</blockquote>It was probably a difference of personal style which caused the friendship to fade. Johnson, for all his reputation for gruffness, was, nevertheless, &#145;heard to lament, with tears in his eyes, that the Wartons had not called upon him for the last four years&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.270, n.1). And he wrote to Warton concerning Charles Burney's youngest son, Richard, and accompanied the boy and his father to Winchester.<br>
<br>Perhaps Warton's comments on Johnson in his edition of Dryden came closest to the truth about Warton's attitude:<blockquote>A love of paradox and contradiction, at the bottom of which was vanity, gave an unpleasant tincture to his manners, and made his conversation boisterous and offensive. I often used to tell the mild and sensible Sir Joshua Reynolds, that he and his friends had contributed to spoil Johnson, by constantly and cowardly assenting to all he advanced on any subject. Mr. Burke only kept him in order, as did Mr. Beauclerc, sometimes by his playful wit. It was a great pleasure for Beauclerc to lay traps for him to induce him to oppose and contradict one day what he had maintained on a former. (p. 151n.)</blockquote>While at Winchester, Warton corresponded with Walpole, Gibbon, Burney, Colman, Malone, Percy, Spence, and John Wilkes, as well as with numerous minor writers and booksellers. And he kept up his correspondence with his old friends Reynolds, Garrick, and Johnson. Walpole sent him the gift of <span class="italic">The Castle of Otranto</span>. Gerald Hamilton thanked him for recommending to him an unknown secretary named Edmund Burke. Reynolds proposed Warton's name for membership of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/49211', "Literary Club")</script> on 10 January 1777 and he attended his first meeting one week later. He was used as an intermediary when John Oglander, warden of New College, Oxford, wanted Reynolds to design a window for the ante-chapel at the college. The king visited Winchester College and heard a speech written by Warton, who was given a new living (Thorley in Hertfordshire) and a prebend in St Paul's (1782). His literary work consisted of the second volume of his <span class="italic">Essay on Pope</span> (1782) and a combined edition of two famous works of literary criticism, <span class="italic">Sir Philip Sydney's defence of poetry and observations on poetry and eloquence, from the Discoveries of Ben Jonson</span> (1787).<br>
<br>The time was not without its sadder moments. Warton's mother died in April 1762 and his ten-year-old daughter, Ann, died after being inoculated against smallpox. The loss of his wife in October 1772 was a severe blow. She was universally liked and admired, and seems to have played no small part in Warton's success at Winchester. On 18 December 1773 he married Charlotte Nicholas (<i>c</i>.1742&#150;1809), a descendant of a former warden of Winchester College. They had one child, Harriet Elizabeth. His daughter Molly married Colonel James Morgan in December 1774 and left with her husband soon after to spend ten years in India. Joseph's son Thomas, who was in holy orders, died in his father's study after college prayers in 1787, and his brother Thomas died at Trinity College, Oxford, in May 1790. Warton's other sons, Joseph (<i>b</i>. 1750) and John (<i>b</i>. 1756), also took holy orders.<br>
<br>Nevertheless the Winchester years were generally happy, as evinced by the letters. Poets and writers who attended the school wrote back to Warton and he took delight in receiving their works. He usually managed to spend Christmas in London visiting friends and attending the theatre. Bishop Lowth, a friend, appointed him prebendary of London in 1782, and presented to him the vicarage of Chorley, Hertfordshire, which he exchanged for that of Wickham, in Hampshire. And William Pitt, the prime minister, conferred on him a prebendal stall at Winchester in 1788. In 1790 Warton was presented with the rectory of Easton in Hampshire which he exchanged for Upham in the same county. The livings of Upham and Wickham he held for life and retired to Wickham after his resignation at Winchester in 1793.<br>
<br>Although Warton's letters indicate that he had been long contemplating retirement, it was the boys' rebellion in 1793 which occasioned it. Warton's role in this insurrection, and the minor one of 1774, has been misinterpreted. He has been accused of being a lax disciplinarian and his &#145;enthusiastic&#146; character perhaps did not lend itself to the kind of authoritarian rule which the Victorians later expected from their schoolmasters. There is, however, another reason for the accusation and the understanding of it goes back to the insurrection of 1774. The incident for which it is mostly remembered concerns the boys' hissing of Warton and his retort: &#145;So, gentlemen; What? Are you metamorphosed into serpents!&#146; Warton had stopped the boys from mimicking a hunchbacked servant. It was this imposition of discipline which brought forth the real demands of the boys, namely that the assistant master, George Isaac Huntingford, be dismissed.<br>
<br>The rebellion of 1793 was far more serious and it involved more than just the commoners. And again Huntingford played an important part. He had been appointed warden in 1789 and in 1793 had declared the Close out of bounds for the boys. When one boy was found there he punished the whole school, causing a general disturbance which was quieted only after he promised a general amnesty, which he broke once order was restored. The boys had agreed that if any were punished all would leave the college and this they did. Warton's role in the rebellion was minor. As headmaster he was nominally responsible. However, his only role in the affair seems to have been that of messenger between the boys and Huntingford as he was the only member of the governing body the boys trusted. No doubt Warton was not a strict disciplinarian in the mould of Huntingford, but it seems that his responsibility for the student rebellions in both 1774 and 1793 has been greatly exaggerated.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>The years after Warton's resignation, spent in Wickham, were devoted to literary pursuits. An edition of Pope, originally proposed to him by John Wilkes in 1792, was finally published in 1797. In it he incorporated, as notes, much of his <span class="italic">Essay</span>, a move for which he was criticized. He also used the opportunity to &#145;give hard blows to the marvellous absurdities of Warburton&#146; and to attack Johnson for his life of Pope&#151;and perhaps also for Boswell's portrayal of Warton. Indeed, many of the comments in the notes are aimed directly at Warburton and Johnson. This caused another controversy involving Warton's former pupil, the poet William Lisle Bowles, who published a poorly edited version of Pope's works in which he acted, somewhat condescendingly, as a judge between Warton, Johnson, and Warburton. Warton did not live to see the edition, as it appeared in 1806. Towards the end of his life he began work on an edition of Dryden which was completed by his son John. Warton died on 23 February 1800 and was buried in Winchester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Warton's poetry, with a few exceptions, is undistinguished, and typical of the mid-century. He is best remembered, and rightly so, as a critic, the first to reassess Pope. He was also a friend of the great and near great and, as with many schoolteachers, had an influence far beyond his immediate circle.<br>
