<span class="headword">Wilde,  James Plaisted</span>, Baron Penzance  (1816&#150;1899), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in London on 12 July 1816, the second son of Edward Archer Wilde (1788&#150;1871), solicitor, and his wife, Marianne Norris. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29396/', "Sir Alfred Thomas Wilde")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Winchester College and later at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in Michaelmas term 1834 and took his BA in 1838 and his MA in 1842. On 15 April 1836 he was admitted as a student at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 22 November 1839, and elected bencher on 15 January 1856.<br>
<br>A pupil of Barnes (afterwards Sir Barnes Peacock), and &#145;devil&#146; to his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29401/', "Sir Thomas Wilde")</script> (later Lord Truro), Wilde was rapidly launched into practice. In 1840 he was made counsel to the commissioners of customs, and thereafter made a successful career both on the northern circuit and at Westminster. He took silk on 6 July 1855, was made counsel to the duchy of Lancaster in 1859, and in 1860 became a baron of the exchequer and was also invested with the coif and knighted (on 13 and 24 April respectively). On 20 February 1860 Wilde married Mary Pleydell Bouverie, the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3018/', "William Pleydell-Bouverie, third earl of Radnor")</script>; they had no children.<br>
<br>After the death of Sir Cresswell Cresswell in 1863 Wilde was transferred to the court of probate and divorce (28 August), and on 26 April 1864 was sworn of the privy council. He soon showed himself worthy of his new office and did much to shape both the substantive law and the procedure of the court, being very much involved in the proceedings under the <span class="roman">Legitimacy Declaration Act</span> (21 &amp; 22 Vict., c. 93). He was created Baron Penzance on 6 April 1869 and on 23 April took his seat in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Wilde was an active peer, concerned with issues of social change. In his maiden speech he justified the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland on the broad ground of equity (15 June 1869). He also helped the government to push through legislation enabling the evidence of the parties to be taken in actions for breach of promise of marriage and adultery proceedings. In the following session he supported the measures in amendment of the laws relating to absconding debtors, married women's property, and the naturalization of aliens, and moved on 27 March 1871 the second reading of the bill for the controversial legalization of marriage with a deceased wife's sister. He also took an active part in the discussions on the judicature bills of 1872 and 1874.<br>
<br>Wilde retired from judicial office in November 1872 because of ill health and took a pension of &pound;3500. In 1874, however, he accepted the position of judge under the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> (37 &amp; 38 Vict., c. 85). He was invested with the statutory jurisdiction by sign manual on 14 November 1874, without anything more than a formal nomination by the archbishops of Canterbury and York. By virtue of the statute he succeeded to the offices of dean of the arches court of Canterbury, master of the faculties, and official principal of the chancery court of York on the retirement in October the following year of Sir Robert Phillimore and Granville Harcourt Vernon. However, a mere declaration of churchmanship was substituted for the oath and subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> required by the 127th canon of 1603&#150;4. This meant that his jurisdiction lacked moral authority, his monitions could be and were often disregarded, and his Erastianism was treated with contempt. Nor was his position in the judicial hierarchy clearly defined: the statute did not expressly constitute his court a superior court of law or invest him with power to commit for contempt, and the court of queen's bench asserted the right to review his decisions and restrain their enforcement by prohibition. Eventually these questions were determined in Penzance's favour by the House of Lords in 1881 and 1882, but by that time his position as ecclesiastical judge was emasculated. The bishops discouraged recourse to his court, while the laity generally doubted the morality or practical sense of prosecuting ritualists and so converting them into martyrs. For these reasons Penzance's court came eventually to be all but deserted for that of the archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>Penzance retired from the bench in March 1899, and died at his seat, Eashing Park, Godalming, Surrey, on 9 December 1899. He was buried on 15 December at Shackleford, near Godalming. His wife died less than a year later on 24 October 1900.<br>
<br>Penzance also served on various royal commissions, including those on the marriage laws (1865), the courts of law (1867 and 1869), claims to compensation consequent on the abolition of purchase in the army (1873), the retirement and promotion of military officers (1874), the customs of the stock exchange (1877), and the condition of Wellington College (1878). He seldom took part in judicial deliberations in the House of Lords. His favourite pastime was gardening, and his favourite flower the rose, which he hybridized with remarkable success.<br>
