<span class="headword">Coffin <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Hatton]</span>,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570/71&#150;1626), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was the son of John Coffin (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1583) of Cornwall, and was born in the diocese of Exeter, probably in Cornwall, about 1570&#150;71. Educated at Liskeard, Cornwall, he travelled to London with Christopher Turner, a relative of his father, in 1584 after the second marriage of his mother. Concealed there for a month, he eventually crossed into France from Essex. Dangerously ill after the journey, Coffin remained in Rouen to recuperate and eventually followed Turner to Rheims, arriving on 19 July 1585. On 7 November 1586 he departed for Ingolstadt with Dr Robert Turner, who helped defray the cost of his education. Coffin received additional support from the bishop of Eichst&auml;tt first at a college in Eichst&auml;tt and then at Ingolstadt. He moved to the English College, Rome, on 26 July 1588 where he studied philosophy and theology. He was ordained on 13 March 1593 in either Ingolstadt or Eichst&auml;tt contrary to Anstruther's claim that Coffin was ordained in the Lateran. Upon his capture in 1598 Coffin admitted that he left Rome before ordination: &#145;butt before I ended my studyes, falling sicke, my bodye nott agreeing with the heats, I retourned into Germany, where by the successor of the other Bishop [of Eichst&auml;tt] I was made priest&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 2.352). In March of 1594 he was sent to England. Entering the Jesuits on 13 January 1598 he and Thomas Lister were seized by Dutch soldiers at Lillo near Antwerp as Coffin was travelling to the noviciate. Sent back to England, Coffin was imprisoned in Newgate and Framlingham. There he remained until he was exiled in 1603 upon the accession of James I. After a year at the English College in St Omer, Coffin moved to Rome in 1604. Between 1604 and the spring of 1625 he worked at the English College, Rome, as consultor, confessor, spiritual prefect, and prefect of the church. He was professed of the four vows in Rome on 1 January 1615.<br>
<br>From Rome, Coffin's long preface to Robert Parsons's <span class="italic">A Discussion of the Answere of M. William Barlow</span> (1612&#151;completed by Thomas Fitzherbert upon the author's death in 1610) contributed to the controversy surrounding the Jacobean oath of allegiance. Coffin interwove defences both of the Society of Jesus and of Robert Parsons in his explanation why &#145;so idle a worke as M. Barlowes Answere is knowne, and taken to be, should be answered at all by so grave and learned a man as F. Persons was&#146;  (preface, b). In his other major controversial work, <span class="italic">A refutation of M. Ioseph Hall his apologeticall discourse, for the marriage of ecclesiasticall persons</span> (1619), he defended clerical celibacy against protestant attacks. A translation under the title of <span class="italic">M. Antonius de Dominis archbishop of Spalato, declares the cause of his returne, out of England</span> (1623) publicized the return of the controversial archbishop to the Roman Catholic church. More important perhaps were his translation of Robert Bellarmine's work into English as <span class="italic">The Art of Dying Well</span> (1621) and his own account of the cardinal's final days, <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Last Sicknes and Death of Cardinall Bellarmine</span> (1622). Coffin petitioned to work once more on the English mission and returned to St Omer in May 1625. Illness prevented his crossing and he died in St Omer on 17 April 1626. Philip Alegambe described Coffin as &#145;a pious and learned man, of primitive simplicity&#146;  (P. Alegambe, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca scriptorum Societatis Iesu</span>, 1643, 98).<br>
