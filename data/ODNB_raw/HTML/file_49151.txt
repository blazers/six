<span class="headword">Mackenzie,  Charles Frederick</span>  (1825&#150;1862), <span class="occ">bishop of central Africa</span>, born at Harcus Cottage, Portmore, Peeblesshire, on 10 April 1825, was youngest child of Colin Mackenzie (<i>d</i>. 1830) of Portmore, a clerk of session, an Episcopalian, and one of Scott's friends and colleagues. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9848/', "Sir William Forbes, sixth baronet (1739&#150;1806)")</script>, of Pitsligo. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17605/', "William Forbes Mackenzie (1807&#150;1862)")</script> was his brother. After his father's death in 1830 he was brought up by his eldest sister, Elizabeth, attending first a private school and then Edinburgh Academy and, from 1840, the Grange School, Bishopwearmouth, near Sunderland, where he revealed a talent for mathematics. He went into residence as a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1844, but, finding that he would as a Scot be disqualified from holding a fellowship there, moved the next May to Gonville and Caius College. He read diligently, and in January 1848 was placed second wrangler in the mathematical tripos, Isaac Todhunter being senior. He graduated BA in 1848 and MA in 1851. From 1848 to 1862 he was fellow of and became a tutor there. Tall, well made, and muscular, he delighted in athletic exercise, was an oarsman and cricketer, and rowed and played cricket with the undergraduates of the college after his election as fellow. In May 1848 he was appointed one of the secretaries to the Cambridge board of education, and held that office until 1855. He was ordained deacon on Trinity Sunday 1851, and from October 1851 to 1854 was curate at Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire, while continuing his college work. In 1852 he was an examiner for mathematical honours, and was moderator in 1853&#150;4, publishing in 1854 with William Walton <span class="italic">Solutions of the Problems and Riders Proposed in the Senate-House Examination for 1854</span>.<br>
<br>Although anxious to become a missionary Mackenzie yielded to friends' advice, and in 1853 refused an invitation to join the Delhi mission, but in December 1854 accepted the offer of John William Colenso, bishop of Natal, to take him to Natal as his archdeacon. Accompanied by his elder sister Anne he embarked with Colenso on 7 March 1855. For about a year and a half he acted as parish priest to the English settlers at Durban, meeting strong opposition from his congregation, who disapproved of his use of the surplice&#151;&#145;preaching in a surplice appeared to some to be only Popery in disguise&#146;  (Goodwin, 124)&#151;and other changes made in accordance with Colenso's wish. An opposition service was started, conducted by a layman. His sister Alice joined him in 1857, and after taking part in the Umlazi mission he was established at a post on the Umhlali River about 40 miles north of Durban, where he worked hard ministering to the scattered English settlers, the soldiers quartered in the neighbourhood, and a small congregation of Africans. He was appointed salaried chaplain to the troops in 1858. In the church conference held at Pietermaritzburg in April he advocated the right of black congregations to an equal voice with white congregations in the proposed church synod, and being defeated retired from the conference. After a severe attack of illness he returned to England in the summer of 1859. In November after David Livingstone's appeal in speeches at Oxford and Cambridge universities, he accepted the invitation of the delegates of the new Universities' Mission to central Africa to be head of their mission. The upper house of convocation having in June 1860 approved the appointment of missionary bishops, and desiring that Mackenzie be ordained bishop by the bishop of Cape Town and his comprovincials, he sailed from England&#151;with a presentiment that he would never return&#151;on 6 October, arriving at the Cape on 12 November, and was consecrated bishop of central Africa in Cape Town Cathedral on 1 January 1861.<br>
<br>After a visit to Natal Mackenzie met Livingstone at Kongoni, and was persuaded by him to ascend the Rovuma, in an attempt to reach the Shire district without passing through territory claimed by the Portuguese. The river proved unnavigable and he finally ascended the Zambezi and Shire rivers. Marching into the Shire highlands under Livingstone's conduct, they encountered a party of eighty-four slaves, mainly women and children, being driven for sale in the Zambezi valley. On Livingstone's initiative the group was liberated and presented to the bishop as his first congregation. This intervention, followed by others which over the next few days brought the number under his protection to 177, determined in two ways all else that befell the mission. First, in a region torn by wars generated by the Indian Ocean slave trade, it committed Mackenzie to use force in defence of his clients. No sooner had their party been settled by Livingstone at Magomero, they were persuaded by a council of Mangania chiefs and headmen to protect Mangania territory from incursions by Yao slavers. After binding the chiefs not to enslave any captives they might make, and to discourage slavery, Mackenzie and his party joined in the war. Their help enabled their allies to win two victories which added more refugees to their settlement.<br>
<br>The second consequence of such a beginning was that Mackenzie and his party were themselves widely believed to be slavers. The bishop interpreted the wars as &#145;tribal&#146; and understood his own actions as giving support to the secular authority of his diocese. In practice, the whole region had passed under the control of warlords, who fought with each other irrespective of &#145;tribe&#146;, and whom the missionaries by seizing clients and building a stockade appeared to be imitating. Their numbers dropped as their people, fearing to be sold as slaves, abandoned Magomero. In December, when three of his party were exploring a shorter route to the Shire, they were attacked under the impression that they were slavers at the village of Mangasanja and two men and some goods seized. Mackenzie engaged the help of the Makololo people, and set out on 23 October 1861 to punish those he believed to be the aggressors, burnt Mangasanja, and recovered the missing men. He then had to hasten to the confluence of the Ruo and the Shire, where Livingstone had arranged to meet him with stores on 1 January 1862. On their way he and his companion, an ordained missionary, lost their medicines by the upsetting of a boat, and Mackenzie pushed on without them. He arrived too late to meet Livingstone, and died at Malo Island of a fever on 31 January. He was buried on Malo Island. In January 1863 Livingstone visited Mackenzie's grave and erected a cross over it. A fund raised in Mackenzie's memory was applied to the establishment in 1870 of the see of Zululand.<br>
<br>Mackenzie was nearly 6 feet in height, with a pleasant expression, rather small eyes, and a forehead which, naturally large, appeared larger owing to early baldness. In manner he was winning and gentle, unselfish, and full of vigour. The controversies which drove him from Natal anticipated many of the conflicts between visiting missionaries and the settler church which have dogged Anglicanism in South Africa until recently. In the Shire highlands, his actions show him to have been profoundly innocent of the problems of the region and the complexities of his position.<br>
<br>Charles Mackenzie's elder sister <a name="cosubject_49151"></a><span class="headword">Anne Mackenzie</span>  (1813/14&#150;1877)<span class="occ"></span> for several years accompanied him, and &#145;her life entwined itself around his work&#146;  (Awdry, 3). Born presumably in Edinburgh or at Harcus Cottage, Portmore, Peeblesshire, she was educated at home and &#145;attended classes&#146;. An invalid, &#145;always ailing, often very ill &hellip; there seemed no special niche in life for her&#146;  (Awdry, 33). After her mother's death she lived mainly in lodgings, sometimes in Edinburgh, sometimes at the seaside, with her maid.<br>
<br>In 1854, advised for her health to live in a milder climate, Anne Mackenzie accepted her brother Charles's invitation to accompany him to Natal. She was never a professed missionary, and was initially unenthusiastic about missionary work and did not consider being a missionary &#145;as quite a gentleman's profession&#146;  (Awdry, 35). A conventional middle-aged spinster&#151;at forty-two reportedly one of the oldest European women in the colony&#151;she found colonial life difficult. White ants destroyed property, Africans put rancid grease on their skins, and &#145;the Kafir smell, as she calls it, made her sick, or faint&#146;  (ibid., 64), and African girls were &#145;sad romps, knowing nothing of the duty of modesty&#146;  (ibid., 56). Nevertheless she kept house for her brother, &#145;made him a comfortable home&#146;  (Goodwin, 134), and tried to maintain her &#145;dainty ways&#146;. She helped with his pastoral tasks, preferring to work with settlers rather than Africans. In 1857 they were joined by their sister Alice, and in 1859 Anne and her brother returned to England. In 1860 they went back to the Cape. In 1861 he went to Magomero while she remained in Cape Town intending to join him later.<br>
<br>In December 1861 Anne Mackenzie and Mrs Burrup, the young bride of Henry Burrup, Mackenzie's fellow missionary, with their maids, travelled on a brig to join Mackenzie's party. After delays and vicissitudes, at Kongoni, at the mouth of the Zambezi, they met Livingstone, later than planned. He did not want them to come&#151;he wrote that &#145;most high church people lean on wives or sisters&#146;  (Jeal, 302)&#151;and he was &#145;rather abrupt and ungracious&#146;  (Awdry, 232) to Miss Mackenzie. They started up the Zambezi in Livingstone's boat, the <i>Pioneer</i>. The journey was unhappy. Dr John Kirk considered Miss Mackenzie &#145;an old invalid who had followed him [her brother] through some sort of fanatical infatuation&#146;  (Jeal, 306). She disliked Mary Livingstone&#151;Livingstone's embittered, heavy-drinking wife&#151;as she considered Mrs Livingstone's criticism of missionaries an attack on her brother. There were quarrels, Livingstone was angry, and the sailors got drunk and enjoyed African women. Miss Mackenzie and Mrs Burrup transferred to a naval open gig under Captain Wilson RN, of the paddle-frigate <i>Gorgon</i>, who was helping the expedition. Miss Mackenzie was ill with fever. On 3 March she learned her brother had died. She returned ill to Cape Town and thence to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Anne Mackenzie resided with friends at Havant, Hampshire. She collected funds for Bishop Gray's Zululand &#145;Mackenzie mission&#146;, named after her brother, and published an edition of her late friend Mrs Robertson's letters, <span class="italic">Mission Life among the Zulu-Kafirs: Memorials of Henrietta Robertson</span> (1866). From 1866 she edited a small missionary periodical, <span class="italic">The Net</span>. She also taught Sunday school. &#145;A person of very decided opinions &hellip; a fair fragile lady, tenderly refined, and old rather with sorrow than with years&#146;  (Awdry, 257&#150;8), she died aged 62 on 12 February 1877 at Woodfield, Havant.<br>
