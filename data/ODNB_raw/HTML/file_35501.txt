<span class="headword">Peulev&eacute;,  Henri Leonard Thomas <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1963), <span class="occ">special operations officer</span>, the only son of Leonard Otho Peulev&eacute; and his wife, Eva Juliet Dallison, both of British nationality, was born on 29 January 1916 at Worthing, where his mother and sister were temporarily in refuge from the German invasion of France. The family home was in Paris where Leonard Peulev&eacute; represented a firm of British seedsmen until the outbreak of war in 1914 when he joined the British army. At the time of his son's birth he was a staff sergeant-major in the Army Service Corps. When the fighting in France became stabilized as trench warfare, his wife returned with the two children, moving from one place to another as her husband's unit was posted from this sector to that.<br>
<br>The Peulev&eacute; agency in France was not revived after the war and the family's wanderings continued while Peulev&eacute; sought to make a living, shuttling back and forth between France and England, with a period in Algiers where for a time he was British vice-consul. Thus Harry Peulev&eacute;'s upbringing was as unsettled as his education was varied. His many schools included a nuns' kindergarten in Algiers, the Shakespeare School at Stratford upon Avon, Rye grammar school, private schools and tutors in England and France, and finally a technical college in London where he took courses in telegraphy and wireless which led him to his first job, as technical assistant in the Baird Television Company. From this he went on to the British Broadcasting Corporation in the early days of television, became a cameraman, and was so employed at the outbreak of war in 1939 when he joined the army.<br>
<br>Peulev&eacute; was commissioned in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, worked on the first radar equipment, and later transferred with the rank of captain to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), whence in 1942, as one of the earliest volunteers, he was seconded to Special Operations Executive (SOE), the paramilitary body created by the British joint chiefs of staff to organize and conduct clandestine warfare in enemy-occupied territories. Peulev&eacute; could not have been better fitted for such a task: he was bilingual and could pass as a Frenchman in France; his loyalties to that country and to Britain were equal, indivisible, and dedicated; he had an ingrained ability to make the best, even to take advantage, of the unpredictable; and he was already a specialist in wireless communication as both technician and operator. As though these qualifications were insufficient, nature had provided him with a well-built body, broad-shouldered and suggestive of considerable physical strength. Large grey-green eyes which could on occasion compel without frightening were allied with a persuasiveness remarkable in that it was always muted and made acceptable by his charm of personality. These attributes came together in developing his powers of leadership in circumstances where difference and independence in the men he commanded in the field were uncontained by the disciplines of military training. A final gift stood him in great stead in outwitting and escaping his enemies: he was able to withdraw mentally, to make his mind still in the presence of those he did not want to notice him&#151;a surer disguise than any false beard or dark glasses.<br>
<br>After training in a secret agent's special skills by SOE, Peulev&eacute; parachuted near N&icirc;mes on the night of 30 July 1942, but, by the pilot's error, he was too low for safe landing and broke a leg. He escaped across the mountains on crutches into Spain where he was imprisoned; in April 1943 he got away and reached England in very poor physical condition. After recuperating he volunteered to try again. In September 1943 he was landed safely by light aircraft; he established himself in the Corr&egrave;ze area and extended his influence to the northern Dordogne. With the help of the novelist Andr&eacute; Malraux he based his &#145;Author&#146; network in the market town of Brive-la-Gaillarde, from where he co-ordinated twenty-four supply drops of arms and equipment. He trained and armed a large group of resistance fighters which in the course of the following five months reached some 4000 men whom he led in extensive sabotage operations, on occasions joining battle in running fights with German occupation troops and inflicting considerable casualties.<br>
<br>Despite the Gestapo's determined efforts to find and capture him, Peulev&eacute; evaded them until by a stroke of bad luck he was erroneously suspected of being a black marketeer and arrested with three of his team on 21 March 1944. Interrogated under torture he refused to talk, and the enemy never discovered who he was and the important part he had played in the clandestine war. Imprisoned in solitary confinement at Fresnes for four months, he attempted escape, was shot and wounded in the thigh, and, since he was refused medical treatment, himself removed the bullet with the aid of a spoon. In August 1944 he was taken to Buchenwald where he was chosen by F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas as one of the two agents who with himself changed identities with Frenchmen dying of typhus. In November he was transported to Sch&ouml;nebeck camp near Magdeburg. As one of the prison's forced labour group Peulev&eacute; was more easily able to escape (11 April 1945); but he was recaptured almost within sight of an advancing American unit by two Belgian SS. He persuaded the two men of the danger of being captured in uniform, suggested they undress, and while they were doing so seized one of their pistols and made them his prisoners, then delivered them to the Americans. He was appointed to the DSO, made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and received the MC and Croix de Guerre.<br>
<br>After the war Peulev&eacute; worked for the Shell Oil Company in several European countries, Egypt, and Tunis. In 1952 he married Marie-Louise Jahn, a Danish woman; they had a son and a daughter, but were divorced in 1956. Peulev&eacute; died at the Hotel Alfonso XIII in Seville, of a heart attack on 18 March 1963.<br>
