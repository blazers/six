<span class="headword">Taylor,  William Ernest</span>  (1856&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Swahili scholar and missionary</span>, was born on 25 January 1856 at 26 The Cross, St Nicholas, Worcester, the eldest child in the family of at least four sons and two daughters of Samuel Taylor (1822&#150;1884), perfumer, and his wife, Harriette Fussell (1827&#150;1907). From King's School, Worcester, he won a scholarship in 1873 to Hertford College, Oxford, and obtained a third class in classical honour moderations in 1876. He studied at the medical school of Edinburgh University in 1879.<br>
<br>In July 1880 Taylor was made deacon by the bishop of Mauritius for the bishop of London, and in the same month he sailed for east Africa, to the Nyanza mission, under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). The greater part of this first tour was spent in or near Mombasa, when the Swahili-speaking people still formed the overwhelming majority of the island's population. Taylor quickly began to acquire that complete command of the Swahili language and that intimacy with its literature on which his fame would rest. He was fortunate in having as his teachers two of Mombasa's foremost scholars, Mu&#145;allim Sikujua bin Abdallah al-Batawi and Bwana Hemedi bin Muhammad al-Mambasi.<br>
<br>Taylor returned to east Africa for a second tour at the end of 1884, and was ordained priest by Bishop James Hannington in Frere Town, Mombasa, on 31 May 1885. In 1891 came the publication of <span class="italic">African Aphorisms, or, Saws from Swahili-Land</span>, an annotated collection of some 600 proverbs: the work (reissued in 1924) provided an outlet for his immense erudition, and became recognized as a classic in the domain of Swahili studies. In the same year the British Museum acquired its first Swahili manuscript (BL, MS Or. 4534), the vendor being Taylor.<br>
<br>On 21 April 1892 Taylor married Catherine Tesseyman (1864&#150;1959); they had five sons and a daughter. Following his marriage he left England on his third and final east African tour. In 1895 he became examining chaplain to the bishop of eastern equatorial Africa, Alfred Tucker. In 1896 the CMS requested Taylor to continue his translation work in Swahili in Cairo, not Mombasa. After a brief visit to Omdurman in 1900, he returned to England. In 1903 he was a CMS missionary in Khartoum and acting chaplain to the forces, but on medical grounds he was compelled to retire to England later that year. Taylor then held a succession of clerical appointments, the last of which was the benefice of Halton Holgate, Lincolnshire, in 1921.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Zaburi za Davidi</span> (1904), the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> of David, is probably Taylor's finest <span class="roman">Bible</span> translation&#151;it may reasonably be compared with the Coverdale psalter. In 1910 Taylor's fellow missionary Alice Burt published her <span class="italic">Swahili Grammar and Vocabulary</span>; the standard of Swahili adopted was that set by Taylor. At the end of the twentieth century, this work remained the unrivalled grammatical introduction to the Swahili of Mombasa. In 1915 Taylor published the Mombasa version of a much-loved poem <span class="italic">al-Inkishafi</span>; the poetic rendering that accompanied the recension was the first printed English translation of a major Swahili poem.<br>
<br>Taylor was the first to realize that, on linguistic grounds, Swahililand should be studied as three regions; he was the first to study in depth the phenomenon of aspiration in Swahili; he was the first and (with the exception of H. E. Lambert) the only European to compose and publish Swahili poetry; and he was the only European to have caused a new genre to be introduced to Swahili poetry, &#145;mahadhi ya Tela&#146; (&#145;Taylor's tune&#146;). With his teachers he salvaged from oblivion many of the Swahili poets, notably the Mombasa poet Bwana Muyaka. Only two other Englishmen approached Taylor's achievement&#151;H. E. Lambert (1893&#150;1967) and J. W. T. Allen (1904&#150;1979): all three were amateurs.<br>
<br>Taylor was a non-smoker and a teetotaller. The evidence suggests that he did not relate well to other people&#151;the literati of Swahili Mombasa being the exception. Taylor died of a heart attack at Manvers Hall, Bath, on 2 October 1927, and was buried five days later at Lyncombe, Widcombe, and St James's cemetery, Bath. He bequeathed his linguistic books and papers to the British Museum, but the bequest was turned down. Much of his invaluable collection went to the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, and other items were acquired by the University of Hamburg.<br>
