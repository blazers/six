</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peacock, Sir  Edward Robert</span>  (1871&#150;1962), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born in the manse at Glengarry, Ontario, Canada, on 2 August 1871, the eldest son of the Revd William MacAllister Peacock (<i>d</i>. 1883), Presbyterian minister and third-generation Canadian, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDougall. When young he almost died of typhoid fever, and on doctor's advice he was prevented from attending school. In despair, at the age of ten he used the <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> to teach himself to read and write; he always attributed his atrocious handwriting to his early lack of formal education.<h2>
<a name="Educationearlycareerandmarriage"></a>Education, early career, and marriage</h2>Peacock's father died in 1883 and his mother, in straitened circumstances, took their daughter and three sons to Almonte where Edward attended the high school. In 1890 he entered the prestigious Queen's University, Kingston, where he read English and social sciences; he graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> in 1894, with prizes in philosophy and political economy. He then trained at the School of Pedagogy, Toronto, perhaps because teaching was commonly regarded as a stepping stone to other professions, and went on to attend Upper Canada College, a leading public school, as a teacher of English; he later became senior housemaster. Peacock's headmaster was Sir George Parkin who, along with G. M. Grant and Adam Shortt, both of Queen's University, was an apostle of imperial unity, and he strongly moulded Peacock's views.<br>
<br>In 1902 Peacock left teaching to join E. R. Wood, a leading Canadian financier, as his personal assistant. Wood had established the Dominion Securities Corporation in 1901, and on discovering that Peacock's work at Upper Canada College meant that he knew many wealthy people, he appointed him a bond salesman at Dominion; about 1905 he then made him &#145;manager&#146; of what had become Canada's leading securities house. In 1907 Peacock went to London to open a European office and in 1909 he settled there permanently, at the same time as other Canadian financiers such as Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook) and Sir James Hamet Dunn (1874&#150;1956) were also making London their home. In London, Dominion issued and placed Canadian industrial securities at a time when Britain's portfolio investment in Canada had peaked. Initially Dominion worked closely with Speyer Brothers. Peacock established himself surprisingly quickly, meeting Montagu Collet Norman (1871&#150;1950) in 1907, with whom he became great friends, and leading figures such as Lord Milner and Arthur Steel-Maitland. He was closely connected with the &#145;round table&#146; movement, which was concerned with imperial affairs.<br>
<br>On 15 July 1912 Peacock was married in New York to Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1948), daughter of John Coates of Ottawa and widow of Frederick J. Campbell, and they brought up two adopted daughters. Coates was a civil engineer who in 1880 had formed John Coates &amp; Co. in London and who later spent time in Canada and Australia, where he established local businesses connected with London. For some years Peacock was a director of John Coates &amp; Co.<h2>
<a name="Growingreputationinfinance"></a>Growing reputation in finance</h2>By 1915 Peacock had achieved wide recognition within London's financial community. Dominion had financed the Brazilian Traction Light and Power Company Ltd, which controlled subsidiary companies in Barcelona and Mexico, and following the outbreak of war, when the Barcelona company experienced severe funding difficulties, Peacock negotiated a refinancing on behalf of its bondholders. However, when the company's president, Dr F. S. Pearson, perished in the <i>Lusitania</i> disaster of 1915, Peacock left Dominion to succeed him as president. He subsequently became president of the Mexican company, when it too ran into difficulties, and financial vice-president of the Brazilian company. For almost a decade Peacock nursed the Barcelona and Mexican companies back to good health, travelling widely and becoming well known in the business communities of Spain and Mexico, and of Paris and Brussels. Gaspard Farrer, a senior partner of Barings, the leading London merchant bankers, in 1922 urged a colleague &#145;to make tracks for him. He is well worth knowing. He took up Dr Pearson's interests &hellip; all in the same state of utter impecuniosity and brought them through in a wonderful way&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP33.21). Peacock formalized his Barings' connection in 1920, when the firm underwrote a &pound;1.05 million debenture issue for the Barcelona company.<h2>
<a name="TheBankofEnglandandtheTreasury"></a>The Bank of England and the Treasury</h2>In 1920 Peacock's old friend Montagu Norman became governor of the Bank of England, and in 1921 he &#145;exercised a good deal of influence&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP200, 26) in arranging for Peacock's appointment to the bank's court. Norman, as well as wanting to introduce to the bank forward-thinking directors who understood the realities of Britain's post-war economy, also sought a representative from the dominions to encourage the introduction of central banking. As at other stages in his career the rise in Peacock's authority was meteoric. By 1922 he had joined the important committee of Treasury and had attended the Paris conference on Mexican debts and the International Economic Conference at Genoa.<br>
<br>On the Treasury committee Peacock worked closely with John Baring, second Baron Revelstoke, Barings' senior partner, who in 1923 invited him to join Barings as a partner. Initially Peacock declined, as it would have required him to leave the court, where tradition dictated that no one house could provide more than one director. However, he relented when the invitation was reissued a year later and joined Barings in early 1924. Revelstoke was now seeking a successor to his ageing deputy, Gaspard Farrer; he also sought his own successor, as he was now sixty years old and premature deaths had already removed potential successors from Barings' partners. The press described Peacock's as an &#145;interesting appointment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Post</span>); certainly Revelstoke and Peacock were markedly different in both culture and temperament. It is hard to think that the hand of Norman was not at work, appointing a like-minded ally to an influential house, where Peacock could work at arm's length from the Bank of England but still take the lead in promoting Norman's ambitious plans for international monetary reconstruction and industrial reorganization. Farrer felt obliged to explain the appointment to Barings' correspondents: &#145;He is absolutely straight&#146;, he told Hopes of Amsterdam, &#145;and without any pretence to special brilliance, has one of the wisest heads I know&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP33.22).<br>
<br>At that time Barings, a limited company, was controlled and largely owned by a partnership, and in this Peacock was given a 10/113ths interest. After Revelstoke's death in 1929 his interest was extended to 24/68ths, but by 1946 this had diminished to 14/68ths. Although not senior in name, his leadership was undisputed and he underlined it by taking over Revelstoke's suite of offices outside the partners' room at Barings and appointing his own expert team. He fitted well into the culture, but strains persisted. Cecil Baring dubbed him &#145;the paycock&#146;  (D. Pollen, 229), and Revelstoke's rather stilted correspondence with him betrayed the lack of intimacy which he enjoyed with Farrer.<h2>
<a name="Reformingstapleindustries"></a>Reforming staple industries</h2>Peacock's experience of Canadian industry, influenced by American technology and management practices, qualified him well to work with Norman for the rationalization and reconstruction of Britain's staple industries. In doing this he was responsible for the immensely successful transition of Barings from specialization in debt issues for foreign governments and businesses to the provision of corporate finance services to British industry. In this he differed greatly from Revelstoke, and in 1927 he seemingly over-stressed his viewpoint to this banker moulded by Edwardian international finance. Norman, Peacock's weekend guest, had stressed &#145;the importance of bringing about closer relationships and a much better understanding between the City of London and the great industries of England&#146;. He told Revelstoke that on this point he found a sympathetic listener and felt that it was a matter of vital importance to Britain that there should be a &#145;much better understanding and more active intervention by the financial people, not merely the rather passive assistance afforded in the form of overdrafts by joint stock banks&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, 202040). His outlook was far removed from that of other pre-war London merchant bankers.<br>
<br>By this time Peacock had also had his skills tested by the great engineering company, Sir W. G. Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co. Ltd, which had run into severe difficulties following rapid yet unsustainable wartime expansion and poorly planned peacetime diversification. Armstrongs was heavily indebted to its bankers, the Bank of England, and its management was unequal to the task. Doubtless under pressure from Norman, the company appointed Barings its advisers in early 1924, and Peacock soon installed James Frater Taylor, a &#145;company doctor&#146;, who eventually took complete charge of its affairs. Peacock arranged a series of refinancings and reconstructions, and he backed Taylor in such measures as merging parts of the company with those of competitors, reorganizing the company structure, and introducing new management and controls. <span class="italic">The Economist</span> described the outcome as &#145;the greatest achievement of financial salvage ever attempted&#146; though Armstrongs emerged as a shadow of its former self, with holders of shares and debentures having lost much of their capital through ruthless write-downs.<br>
<br>Norman and Peacock, with Taylor as their workhorse, became leading proponents of rationalization. &#145;Rationalisation means higher wages and a higher standard of living in spite of the fact that there may [be] short intervals of less employment&#146;, Peacock told Steel-Maitland in 1929 for the benefit of tory electioneering  (ING Baring Archives, 202040). Its justification was that larger corporations, better managed and more able to afford capital expenditure, would achieve the economies of scale required in order to defeat foreign competition.<br>
<br>Whether correct or otherwise, Peacock's philosophy had a profound influence on the face of Britain's staple industries, and no more so than in Lancashire, where a large part of the cotton textile industry was reshaped. The industry was in severe difficulties due to foreign competition, and it risked dragging down those clearing banks which had over-lent to it. Peacock, again working closely with Norman, became involved in this area in 1928, and he devised a scheme to reorganize many of the industry's components into a single entity, the Lancashire Cotton Corporation. By 1933 the corporation had acquired more than 100 mills, and it closed down many&#151;concentrating production at large plant with modern equipment. However, progress was not smooth, and it necessitated further schemes of reconstruction and the injection of new management, which eventually transformed the corporation into a viable unit.<h2>
<a name="OverseasissuesatBarings"></a>Overseas issues at Barings</h2>Most of Barings' activities were far more conventional. In the 1920s its issuing business comprised largely the marketing of bonds of overseas sovereign entities, now frequently handled jointly with Rothschilds and Schroders, but with one house having management control. At Barings, Revelstoke played a leading part, but Peacock's role was increasingly important. One of his first initiatives was to create a large international bond issue in 1926 for the Belgium government; this was brought out simultaneously in London, New York, Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Switzerland. Its organization was centred upon Barings, and Peacock wrote that &#145;it gave me my first opportunity [at Barings] to show what I could do &hellip; as it fell to me to take on the supervision of the whole thing. &hellip; It all went very satisfactorily&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP200, 27&#150;8). Peacock's other major work in this area was the refinancing of large parts of Brazil's and Argentina's external debt in the late 1920s and 1930s, and he also was concerned with the London issuing houses' response to Germany's default in 1934. However, embargoes on the issue of foreign securities in London also meant the shifting of Barings' business to debt issues for British business.<h2>
<a name="OtheractivitieswithBarings"></a>Other activities with Barings</h2>In the 1920s and 1930s Peacock oversaw issues for, <i>inter alia</i>, the North Metropolitan Power Station Company, the Charing Cross Electricity Supply Company, the British Tanker Company, Goodyear Tyre and Rubber (Great Britain) Ltd, and the Southern Railway&#151;modern industries forming the economy's dynamic sector. Of major importance were issues to finance the extension of the London Underground. In a notable break with practice, in 1926 Peacock joined as a preliminary the board of the Underground Electric Railway Company of London, his presence being insisted upon by Jimmy Speyer, an American investment banker and a major shareholder who would otherwise have blocked the underground's expansion plans. Another company to which Peacock led Barings was the Pressed Steel Company (Great Britain), established to use pioneering American technology and management to make motor-car bodies. Peacock, who was close to this business culture and whose passionate desire was for a buoyant and internationally competitive British motor industry (in part as a counterpoise to the declining staples), persuaded his fellow partners to join those of Schroders in subscribing for a major interest in the company's share and loan capital. He placed Frater Taylor on its board to watch over this interest.<br>
<br>Peacock retired from Barings' partnership in 1946; his directorship continued until the end of 1954, but by then he had stayed for too long. Although increasingly detached from day-to-day leadership, however, his high status as the City's elder statesman meant that his advice was still eagerly sought outside Barings. Two issues much concerned him after 1945, namely the nationalization of industry under the Labour Party, which he strongly opposed, and the consolidation of family control of private businesses which were converted to public companies. Little could be done to hold back the tide of nationalization but Peacock's role was central in early discussions between industry leaders, the Bank of England, and the out-of-office tories, for iron and steel denationalization.<h2>
<a name="PeacockandtheBankofEngland"></a>Peacock and the Bank of England</h2>Peacock's major interest outside Barings was unquestionably the Bank of England. He returned to the court in 1929, on Revelstoke's death, but in the interim he had been Norman's continuing confidant. Norman's initial idea of promoting central banking in Canada (and the other dominions) by taking in &#145;the best Canadian we can get &hellip; [so that] we are most likely to influence Canadian opinion without offending their susceptibilities&#146;  (Sayers, 203) in the short term came to nothing. But Peacock soon asserted himself in areas other than rationalization and became immensely powerful. &#145;Because I was the favourite of the Governor&#146;, he was later to write, &#145;it came to be recognised [by the court] that if things were to be got through with the Governor I had better make the approach and that happened very often&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP200, 30).<br>
<br>Rationalization apart, until his retirement in 1946 Peacock had an important say in most vital matters, such as the conversion in 1932 of war loan stock as a step to cheaper money; the rescue from collapse of the Anglo-South American Bank at the time of the 1931 crisis, when it fell to him to plead for clearing bank support; and the chairmanship of a committee&#151;the so-called Peacock committee&#151;to review the administration of the bank, which made, in Peacock's words, &#145;revolutionary suggestions, all of which were accepted by our colleagues&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP200, 40&#150;41). In 1943 Norman sent him in secret to Canada to sound out Graham Towers, governor of the Bank of Canada, on his willingness to succeed Norman as governor of the Bank of England. As &#145;commander royal&#146; Peacock travelled in the belly of a bomber aircraft, packed like a sardine alongside fellow passengers. In 1953, at the bank's behest, he was a somewhat reluctant midwife of the Commonwealth Development Finance Corporation, realizing that it would make little impact and that it would fail to attract high-quality proposals. However, he subsequently sat on the corporation's board.<br>
<br>Above all else, at the time of the 1931 economic crisis, which caused the government to fall and eventually drove the country from the gold standard, Peacock emerged alongside Sir Ernest Harvey, deputy governor, as the bank's natural leader in the prolonged absence of Norman due to sickness. From the end of July until about October, he and Harvey worked without a break, taking part in &#145;all the consultations that were almost continuous. We saw the Prime Minister and the Chancellor &hellip; every day, and with the permission of the Prime Minister we also kept the leaders of the two other parties informed&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP200, 34).<br>
<br>On the evening of the government's fall and with the nation tottering on the precipice of economic collapse, Peacock was summoned to dine with George V (who knew him well) in order to brief the king on the impending crisis. As they dined the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, fled from a cabinet meeting in uproar and drove to Buckingham Palace to offer his resignation. There, after a telephone briefing from Harvey at Downing Street, Peacock found MacDonald &#145;dishevelled and wild&#146; but ahead of him in his return to the king's presence. &#145;I rushed up one stairway as I saw MacDonald going up the other&#146;, Peacock later recounted, &#145;and managed to get in to see the King and tell that much and I added: &#147;I am afraid, Sir, it is all up to you now&#148;&#146;. Counselled and placated by the king, who doubtless followed Peacock's advice, MacDonald returned to Downing Street with Peacock, and entered by the garden gate in order to avoid the press. There Peacock and Harvey spent the night encouraging MacDonald's acceptance of the king's wish for the formation of a government of national unity, as opposition party leaders arrived for discussions. They pointed to the prime minister's chief asset, namely his chancellor, Philip Snowden: he &#145;had been the sturdy, admirably courageous man throughout the trouble&#146;, wrote Peacock later, &#145;a realist who did not allow his theories to interfere with the facts&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP200, 36&#150;7).<h2>
<a name="Otherpublicduties"></a>Other public duties</h2>In 1929 Peacock took up the chairmanship of the channel tunnel committee at the request of prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, and in 1934 he was appointed a member of the royal commission on tithes. However, his most significant work in the service of the crown was as a Treasury representative, when he was charged in 1941 with the disposal of direct British investments in the United States. A powerful American lobby was then clamouring for Britain to do more to help itself in funding its war effort by selling direct investments at inevitable bargain prices. Over several months, by use of delaying tactics and calling upon the services of his old banking and political friends, Peacock staved off these emergency sales and eventually played a central role in negotiating loans totalling $425 million. However, it was not before the controversial sale of Britain's most valuable American asset, Courtaulds' American Viscose Corporation, was forced upon him so as not to imperil the passing of vital &#145;lend-lease&#146; legislation.<br>
<br>Peacock's charitable interests were extensive. He succeeded Revelstoke as treasurer of the King Edward's Hospital Fund, the influential and wealthy London hospital charity, and he remained so until 1954. He was chairman of the trustees of the Imperial War Graves Commission; chairman of the board of management of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851; a trustee of the King George's Jubilee Fund from 1935; and, not least, a Rhodes trustee from 1925. At the behest of the prince of Wales he played a prominent part in the foundation of the National Council of Social Service, where he was important in ensuring the continuation and development of the Citizens' Advice Bureau service when its future was in doubt after the war.<br>
<br>Peacock succeeded Revelstoke as receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall, and he also played a general role as financial adviser to many members of the royal family. At the time of the abdication crisis of 1936 he stood alongside Edward VIII and &#145;was more nearly in his confidence than anyone except Monckton and Allen&#146;  (Ziegler, 311). He offered advice well beyond financial matters and helped to thrash out the subsequent financial settlement, when his clarity of thought and directness of delivery again shone through. &#145;The discussions tended to become heated &hellip; so I intervened &hellip; and removed the technicalities&#146;, he later wrote, &#145;and stated directly and simply [to the King] what I thought would be his desire&#146;  (ibid., 328). His standing with other members of the king's family remained uncompromised and he served them until his death. For his services to the crown, George V appointed him GCVO in 1934.<br>
<br>Canada remained close to Peacock's heart throughout his life, and he had intended to live there in retirement. He was European director of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from 1926 to 1961, and was on the board of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1931 to 1952. He continued as a director of Brazilian Traction, notably in the mid-1920s, dealing with the controversial Belgian financier Alfred Loewenstein, who had taken a large shareholding in the company; he subsequently took charge of Loewenstein's financial affairs when he ran into difficulties and disposed of this interest. He helped to supervise the finances of welfare agencies for Canadian forces abroad during the Second World War. In 1952 he took the initiative in Barings' formation, with Morgan Grenfell and Canadian interests, of the securities house Harris &amp; Partners of Toronto, of which he was first chairman. He was a trustee of Queen's University from 1912 to 1947, and also a benefactor, in particular endowing two chairs.<h2>
<a name="Characterdeathandreputation"></a>Character, death, and reputation</h2>Contemporaries remember Peacock's immense presence and clear, penetrating eyes, his clarity of thought, his directness and decisiveness of approach, and his lack of affectation and pomposity. His capacity for, and speed of, work was immense and others had to maintain his pace. Fools were suffered with difficulty and mistakes not easily forgiven. His words were few and demanded brevity in others; his dictation went at a furious pace. &#145;The more difficult the matter, the faster he would dictate&#146;, his secretary later recalled. &#145;I sometimes wondered if I could get the page over in time to keep up&#146;. His English and its construction would be &#145;faultless&#151;short, clear, no superfluous words, simplicity in choice of words, never &#147;pompous&#148; or &#147;clever&#148;. He was on top of the world when at his busiest&#146;  (ING Baring Archives, DEP237). While he could become furiously angry with his staff, all of whom were devoted to him and he to them, no disaster or crisis ever shook his calm. For all his greatness, he was self-effacing and unassuming. He died in the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital on 19 November 1962, and was cremated at Woking, Surrey, on 22 November.<br>
<br>Peacock was one of the City's most distinguished merchant bankers of the first half of the twentieth century. He dominated Barings in the 1930s and 1940s, and among other things he was responsible for the firm's immensely successful transition into a modern merchant bank focused on providing services, especially of corporate finance, to domestic industry. But his role at the Bank of England meant that, in the 1930s at least, his influence in the City was exceeded only by that of Norman. In particular he was an extremely important proponent of industrial rationalization, in which he called on his experience of large North American businesses. During the 1931 financial crisis, arguably the most serious to affect twentieth-century Britain, he outshone all his rivals in both the City and Whitehall. In reality there were few areas of British financial policy from the 1920s to the 1940s in which his contribution was not substantial. This achievement by Peacock, who was born far from the British establishment but who absorbed its values and won its acceptance without compromise to his Canadian culture and the humbleness of his origins, serves to underline the true remarkableness of his personal qualities.<br>
