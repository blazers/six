<span class="headword">Haq, Abul Kashem Fazlul</span>  (1873&#150;1962), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in India and Pakistan</span>, was born on 26 October 1873 at Saturia, a village in the south of the Bakerganj district of Bengal, the only son of Muhammad Wazid, lawyer, and his wife, Saidunnissa Khatun. His ancestral home was at Chakhar, a village 14 miles from Barisal. After education in Arabic and Persian at home he attended Barisal Zilla School and Presidency College, Calcutta. He obtained the degrees of MA in mathematics and bachelor of law. After completing his studies he worked in legal practice in Barisal and also in 1903&#150;4 was a part-time lecturer at Raj Chandra College there. This was followed by a period in public service until 1912 when he joined the Calcutta high court and determined to enter politics.<br>
<br>Haq (known throughout his political career as A. K. Fazlul Haq, and soon as Sher-e-Bangla, &#145;the Tiger of Bengal&#146;) entered the Bengal legislative council in 1913 as an elected member for the Dacca division. Like a number of political figures of this time he was active in both the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League. He was president of the latter organization from 1916 to 1921 and served as general secretary of the Indian National Congress in 1918&#150;19. He was a member of the Congress's Punjab inquiry committee after the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. In 1920, however, he parted ways with the Congress over the issue of the boycott of educational institutions during the non-co-operation movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. He did not believe this would benefit the educationally backward Muslim community of Bengal. Indeed he did much to encourage increased Muslim participation through such policies as the reservation of spaces in colleges affiliated to Calcutta University during his time as minister of education in 1924. Haq's other main concern was to advance the interests of the tenant and professional class of Bengal's rural hinterland. His early initiatives included the short-lived Calcutta Agricultural Association and the Bengal Praja Party. They paved the way for the Krishak Praja Party, which was to institutionalize Haq's rural power base.<br>
<br>Following the 1937 elections, held under the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935, Haq's Krishak Praja Party emerged with thirty-five seats in the Bengal legislature. Short of a majority, he formed a coalition government with the Muslim League (with himself as chief minister), although he was initially more inclined to work with the Congress. Mohamed Ali Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League, at this juncture needed the support of Haq because of the Muslim League's relatively poor showing both in Bengal and in the Punjab, the other major centre of Muslim population. Haq was thus selected to propose the Lahore resolution, popularly known as the Pakistan resolution, on 23 March 1940 at the Lahore session of the All-India Muslim League. By this time he had become dependent on the Muslim League's support in the legislature, following a rupture with left-wing members of his party, who were restive at the delays in implementing such reforms as the abolition of the <i>zamindari</i> system.<br>
<br>Haq split openly with Jinnah in July 1941 over the issue of Haq's and other Muslims' membership of the viceroy's defence council (which Jinnah condemned, since this meant compromising the league's principle of parity between Muslims and Hindus). He formed another coalition government which drew support from the Bose group of the Congress, as well as the Hindu Mahasabha. The ministry suffered from the Muslim League's offensive against it and the tensions between Haq and the provincial governor, Sir John Herbert. Haq was eventually forced to resign as chief minister on 28 March 1943. His opposition to the demand for the creation of Pakistan resulted in his increasing political marginalization. In the 1946 provincial elections he was able to secure election because of his personal standing, but the Krishak Praja Party captured just 4 of the 117 seats reserved for Muslims.<br>
<br>After the formation of Pakistan Haq resumed his legal career and served as advocate-general of East Pakistan from 1947 until 1952. He also emerged as a prominent figure in the pro-Bengali language movement that was pitted against the Muslim League. On 27 July 1953 he founded the Krishak Sramik Party. He played a leading role in the United Front campaign that trounced the Muslim League in the 1954 East Bengal elections. However, he lasted less than two months in office as chief minister, as a result of the Adamjee Jute Mills riots and his &#145;indiscreet&#146; remarks concerning autonomy for East Pakistan during a speech in Calcutta. After the lifting of governor's rule in June 1955 the Krishak Sramik Party returned to form a coalition government. Haq was shortly afterwards made governor of East Pakistan. His efforts to replace Ataur Rahman's Awami League ministry in March 1958 with the Krishak Sramik Party was opposed at the centre and culminated in his dismissal.<br>
<br>Haq retired to relative obscurity. He was senile by the time of his death at Dacca Medical College on 27 April 1962. There ensued an unseemly squabble between Ayub Khan's government and opposition politicians over who should organize a condolence meeting. The much larger gathering for the unofficial event at the Dacca stadium attested to Haq's popularity arising from his long-time championing of the interests of the rural population and his personal generosity. He was buried in the Tin Netar Mazar (&#145;mausoleum of three national leaders&#146;) in Dacca.<br>
