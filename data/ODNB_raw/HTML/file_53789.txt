<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dickin,  Maria Elisabeth</span>  (1870&#150;1951), <span class="occ">founder of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA)</span>, known by her friends as Mia, was born at 1 Farrington Terrace, South Hackney, Middlesex, on 22 September 1870, daughter of William George Dickin (<i>d</i>. in or before 1899), Wesleyan minister, and his wife, Ellen Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Exell. Maria was the eldest of their eight children, and to supplement the family's slender income she established a voice production studio in Wimpole Street. On 1 September 1899 she married&#151;at the parish church of St John the Evangelist, Westminster&#151;her first cousin Arnold Francis Dickin (<i>b</i>. 1874/5), son of Henry Dickin. Her husband was an accountant living at 4 Orlando Road, Clapham. The 1901 census found the couple living at 12 Mount Nod Road, Streatham, with one servant, and described Arnold Dickin as &#145;accountants' articled clerk&#146; and Mia as &#145;professor of singing&#146;. She later gave up her studio to keep house in Hampstead Heath; they had no children.<br>
<br>Maria Dickin collected short &#145;thoughts and sayings&#146; on religious subjects of Reginald John Campbell (1867&#150;1956)&#151;then Congregational minister of City Temple, London&#151;and published them without commentary as <span class="italic">Suggestive Thoughts from the Temple</span> (1905). She was a practising spiritualist and became active in the revived movement for religious healing. For many years she collaborated with James Moore Hickson, editor and publisher of <span class="italic">The Healer</span>, in promoting &#145;Sunday evenings with the sick&#146;, in the course of which she too was healed. Her preoccupation with pain shifted from human beings to animals when she began visiting the poor in the East End. In 1917 the sight of the injured animals there was, she later recalled, &#145;a revelation to me&#146; and &#145;made me indescribably miserable&#146;  (Dickin, 1). At about this time she went through the &#145;heartrending&#146; experience of nursing her sick dog, which eventually had to be put down, and in describing what followed she momentarily set aside her customary reticence about herself. A &#145;deep and sacred experience&#146;  (ibid., 2) united her own suffering with a semi-obsessive concern about the sufferings of others in the powerful combination often found in reforming pioneers at their moment of creative vision. The mystery of human pain had long troubled her and now became haunting, engulfing her in &#145;an agony of spirit&#146;  (ibid.) and temporarily threatening her religious faith. Sitting alone on holiday in a hotel garden, with her golfing friends elsewhere, she felt the eyes of millions of animals focused imploringly upon her. It was &#145;a command I dare not refuse&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Dickin's hunt for East End premises led her to a sympathetic clergyman who lent her a cellar in Whitechapel, and there she opened the first People's Dispensary for Sick Animals of the Poor on 17 November 1917. In the PDSA's early documents Baroness de Teissier was listed as co-founder but this shadowy figure soon faded from the scene. By 1922 Dickin had become &#145;honorary director&#146;, chairing the PDSA's committee of management&#151;roles that she retained until shortly before she died. No large donations from her were publicized and at no stage did she use the PDSA's literature for self-advertisement; not until 1949 did an annual report publish her photograph. The PDSA aimed to provide free treatment in dispensaries for animals whose owners could not afford a vet. Non-political and non-sectarian, it focused entirely on remedial work and on the educational effort flowing from that, leaving others to prosecute cruelty. Understandably, prominent registered vets were at first discouraging, although Dickin persuaded an experienced and well-known unregistered one, named Hartshorn, to work with her. For the rest of her life vets' hostility threatened her movement, with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the PDSA on one occasion aligned on opposite sides in a lawsuit.<br>
<br>The new movement prospered by drawing together two humanitarian strands: the individualist preoccupation with pain, often emphasized in the analogy that the PDSA drew between human and animal suffering; and the collectivist environmentalism involved in recognizing that working-class cruelty flowed ineluctably from economic necessity and required a co-ordinated remedy. In its first decade the PDSA grew very fast, at first within London but after Dickin's caravan tour of 1923&#151;its mare provided by her husband&#151;within many parts of England. As with other pioneering causes the evil under attack seemed far more prevalent than had been at first supposed, and in the same year the first of several overseas branches was founded, in Tangier. Also in 1923 the PDSA was incorporated, and within seven years its annual income had grown five-fold, more than doubling again during the 1930s. In her will, however, Dickin referred to &#145;the strain &hellip; endured&#146; by herself and by the PDSA's staff during its early years and especially in the national crisis of 1930&#150;32. She published <span class="italic">The Cry of the Animal</span> and other humanitarian works, edited PDSA periodicals, and&#151;combining energy with firmness&#151;ran the organization almost as a family gathering, with its annual staff dinner and its annual church parade and service. She also instituted the Dickin medal (the &#145;animals' VC&#146;), awarded to any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty associated with the armed forces or civil defence in the Second World War; the first was awarded in 1943, and the 53 beneficiaries included 31 pigeons, 18 dogs, 3 horses, and one cat. Her OBE of 1929 was raised in 1948 to a CBE.<br>
<br>All too little is known about Maria Dickin's private life, although she listed &#145;music, literary work and philanthropic&#146; as her recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. She died of influenzal broncho-pneumonia at her home, 4 Lansdowne House, Lansdowne Road, Kensington, London, on 1 March 1951, her husband having predeceased her. In her last will, made in 1947, there were two executors: Maurice Cole of Radlett, an accountant; and Albert Webb of Knightsbridge, deputy chairman of the PDSA. In this will Dickin left many bequests to her sisters and to PDSA officers, but she drew special attention to Albert Webb, noting her gratitude to him &#145;for the many acts of kindness readily given to me&#146; and &#145;for his untiring efforts&#146; in helping her to establish the PDSA, and expressing the hope that he would take her place as its chairman. She asked the trustees to employ her residuary estate to set up a foundation in her name.<br>
<br>By 1950 the PDSA was providing in Britain a regular service in 207 communities, not to mention its animal ambulances and hospitals and its five homes for stray dogs. By the 1960s, according to the PDSA's annual reports, many of its early dispensaries were disappearing in slum-clearance schemes: mass affluence and suburbanization were carrying away the Whitechapel world where Dickin's movement had begun, and were opening up new opportunities and structures. The PetAid hospital and PetAid practice gradually replaced the dispensary, and a network of retail shops reinforced more traditional ways of raising funds. Yet the PDSA retained its name and its objective remained the same: the protection of sick animals whose owners could not pay for the necessary treatment.<br>
