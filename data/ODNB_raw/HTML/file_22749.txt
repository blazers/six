<span class="headword">Price,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704?, <em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">architectural surveyor and author</span>, was probably the Francis Price who was baptized on 23 June 1704 at Petworth, Sussex, son of Francis and Sarah Price. Nothing is known about his father, but his mother, who is described in his will, married twice, her second marriage being to Thomas Consard of Petworth, a vintner with whom she had at least three children (John, Sarah, and Richard Consard). Little is known about Price's early career or education. He was married (his wife, Elizabeth, outlived him, dying on 25 February 1761 at the age of fifty-seven) but at the time of writing his will in 1750 they had no surviving children. By 1736 he was in Salisbury, possibly at the instigation of Bishop Sherlock; certainly he appears to have lived and worked in the city from that date. A number of accounts survive for works done by him on buildings in the cathedral close, including repairs and additions to the bishop's palace (1736&#150;8), Braybrooke (1746), and the north canonry (1751). He was also responsible for rebuilding the west end of Ellingham Church, Hampshire, in 1747. His most important official post was that of surveyor and clerk of the fabric of Salisbury Cathedral&#151;his gravestone records that he had held this position for seventeen years but, although he seems to have acted in this capacity from around 1737, he was not officially appointed until 1745. As clerk of works he carried out an extensive survey of the cathedral and supervised a number of important repairs and rebuildings of the roof and fabric. His <span class="italic">Series of particular and useful observations &hellip; upon &hellip; the cathedral church of Salisbury</span>, published just three months after his death, is one of the first serious architectural studies of a Gothic building. A second enlarged, but anonymous, edition was printed by R. Baldwin in 1774.<br>
<br>Although this book was undoubtedly important, Price's fame chiefly rests on his earlier work, <span class="italic">The British Carpenter</span>. First published as <span class="italic">A Treatise on Carpentry</span> in May 1733, it was reprinted under its new title as an expanded second edition in 1735 and it is by the latter title that it has been known ever since. <span class="italic">A Treatise on Carpentry</span> was the first English book devoted entirely to carpentry and designed specifically for the instruction of craftsmen. The first edition had twenty-eight plates, each labelled alphabetically, with the page of text accompanying that plate beginning with the same letter. In the second edition sixteen plates were added which confused this system further. Through copious drawings Price demonstrated how to construct both timber joints and wooden structures, most of the engravings being devoted to designs for roof trusses for a variety of spans and purposes. In all his books Price drew the plates himself, but had them engraved by others. Many of the structures he showed are complex and may reflect more on the creativity of the artist than the practice of the time, but the popularity of the work meant that his designs were frequently copied by subsequent builders, architects, and writers. From the start the book was well received, running to seven editions by 1768, and this was probably helped by the fact that from the second edition onwards it carried a tribute, dated 28 June 1733, as a &#145;very Useful and Instructive Piece&#146; from three of the most famous architects of the day, Nicholas Hawksmoor, John James, and James Gibbs.<br>
<br>Price evidently gained some status in his own lifetime in Salisbury but he does not seem to have held any other public office. A portrait of him by George Beare dated 1747 is in the National Portrait Gallery; it shows him holding a drawing of the eastern crossing roofs at Salisbury Cathedral which he himself had designed. At the end of his life he lived in the cathedral close and on his death he was thought sufficiently eminent to warrant an obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. He died in Salisbury on 20 March 1753 and was buried in the cathedral cloister outside the chapter-house door.<br>
