<span class="headword">Cutts,  Edward Lewes</span>  (1824&#150;1901), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 2 March 1824 at Sheffield, the son of John Priston Cutts, optician, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Waterhouse. He was educated at Sheffield collegiate school, graduated BA at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1848, and was ordained in the same year. On 23 April 1846 he married Marian, daughter of Robert Knight of Nottingham; they had ten children, seven of whom survived their father. Two sons, John E. K. Cutts and John Priston Cutts, worked together as ecclesiastical architects. A third son, Henry Whitmore Cutts, wood engraver, was the father of the film director <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95006/', "(John Henry) Graham Cutts")</script>. Marian Cutts died in 1889. Cutts was curate successively of Ide Hill, Kent, until 1850, of Coggeshall, Essex, until 1857, and of Kelvedon, Essex, until 1859, and was perpetual curate of Billericay, also in Essex, until 1865. He then became general secretary of the Additional Curates Society, resigning in 1871 to become vicar of Holy Trinity, Haverstock Hill, London.<br>
<br>Cutts's first publications were in medieval archaeology. <span class="italic">A Manual for the Study of the Sepulchral Slabs and Crosses of the Middle Ages</span> appeared in 1849. A series of articles in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, beginning in 1856, was collected and published as <span class="italic">Scenes and Characters of the Middle Ages</span> (1872; 4th edn 1922). From 1852 to 1866 Cutts was honorary secretary of the Essex Archaeological Society and editor of its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>Most of Cutts's subsequent writings were published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. They include works on many ecclesiastical subjects, devotional books, and children's historical fiction. <span class="italic">Turning Points of English Church History</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Turning Points of General Church History</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">Parish Priests and their People in the Middle Ages</span> (1898) were among his books that had more than one edition. <span class="italic">Some Chief Truths of Religion</span> (1875) was translated into Swahili and printed at the Universities Mission Press at Zanzibar in 1895. Cutts contributed the volumes on Jerome (1878) and Augustine (1881) to the series <span class="roman">The Fathers for English Readers</span>. <span class="italic">A Handy Book of the Church of England</span> under his editorship went through eight editions (1892&#150;1901). Cutts's ecclesiastical writings are solid and establishmentarian, exhibiting their author's high-church temperament but treating other parties with sympathy. He was awarded an honorary DD by the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1876.<br>
<br>Cutts broke the routine of a parish clergyman and writer in 1876 when he visited the Assyrian Church of the East as the representative of Archbishop Tait of Canterbury. Accompanied by his son William, he travelled to Turkish Kurdistan and Persia, met the patriarch and bishops, and brought back a scheme for an educational mission. From this journey came his official report <span class="italic">The Assyrian Christians</span> (circulated privately), <span class="italic">Christians under the Crescent in Asia</span>, describing his mission and recording a census of the church, and a fine children's book, <span class="italic">Amina: a Tale of the Nestorians</span> (all 1877). These and his other efforts in keeping the proposed mission before the church public during the next four years led to the establishment of the archbishop of Canterbury's Assyrian mission. Cutts died at Holy Trinity vicarage, 70 Haverstock Hill, on 2 September 1901, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery, Woking.<br>
