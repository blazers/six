<span class="headword">Fitzsimons,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1511), <span class="occ">archbishop of Dublin and lord deputy of Ireland</span>, was born into a prominent family of the English of Dublin, being the son of Robert Fitzsimons and Janet Cusack. He first appears as precentor of St Patrick's Cathedral in 1471, and was acting as vicar-general of the diocese in May 1472. In 1476, he was the chapter's proctor in parliament, where he was given the king's licence of absence from Ireland for two years to visit Rome or some other university. Fitzsimons was provided to the archbishopric itself on 14 June 1484, when, on account of blindness, Archbishop Walton resigned in his favour. He was the first Irish-born prelate to rule the see since St Lorc&aacute;n &Oacute; Tuathail 
    (Laurence O'Toole; <i>d</i>. 1180)
  , and on 26 September he also became the first archbishop to be consecrated in St Patrick's. Restitution of temporalities was subsequently confirmed by great council ordinance on 15 October, with an additional clause permitting Fitzsimons to reoccupy waste tenements of the archbishop's freeholders. This represented Fitzsimons's opening move in the long-running struggle waged by successive archbishops to preserve their rights against the &Oacute; Tuathail and &Oacute; Broin families in disputed wastelands of the south Dublin marches. Yet the archbishop also secured the king's licence for two years to appoint clerks of the Irish nation to benefices in the Irishry where priests of the English nation were unacceptable.<br>
<br>Fitzsimons played a leading role during the Lambert Simnel conspiracy, acting as chancellor to &#145;Edward VI&#146; and, as archbishop, crowning him in Christ Church Cathedral. Yet he apparently disapproved of the hanging of the mayor of Waterford's messenger by Simnel's key supporter, the earl of Kildare, and thereafter his relations with the earl cooled. He received the king's pardon in July 1488, and was prominent in the expiatory ceremony following the rebels' formal submission. In May 1492 Fitzsimons was Henry VII's unexpected choice to replace Kildare when the earl was implicated in another Yorkist plot, that of Perkin Warbeck. As deputy lieutenant, Fitzsimons shared viceregal power with Sir James Ormond, appointed governor in June. The archbishop had primary responsibility for the area round Dublin, but proved no match for Kildare's pervasive influence in the four shires. The king sent over 300 troops in March, and about May Fitzsimons visited court to report on Kildare's continuing feud with Ormond. Ormond eventually took refuge in the archbishop's cathedral after renewed clashes in Dublin. From Fitzsimons's perspective, however, the high point of his deputyship was probably the parliament he convened over the summer and the statute enacted annulling grants and leases made by previous archbishops since 1417&#151;on the grounds that the see's revenues were so decayed that the archbishop could not maintain his dignity nor defend his possessions.<br>
<br>In September, in the face of renewed fears of invasion by Warbeck, the king replaced Fitzsimons with Viscount Gormanston as caretaker governor and, with other leading magnates and officials, summoned the archbishop to court for consultations. Fitzsimons sailed for England almost immediately. He was much less prominent during Poynings's deputyship, but was at court again in summer 1496, participating in the official reconciliation at Salisbury which preceded Kildare's restoration. There, on 6 August, the king appointed him lord chancellor, the only office reserved to the king's nomination in Kildare's patent and which Fitzsimons retained until his death. Subsequently, the archbishop's relations with Kildare remained harmonious. He deputized for the earl during Kildare's last visit to England in 1503; and the following autumn attended the king's council himself to report on Kildare's victorious Knockdoe campaign.<br>
<br>Fitzsimons was apparently a very learned divine and philosopher. At a provincial council which he convened, reputedly in 1496, an ultimately abortive decree was passed for the establishment of a university in Dublin, with provision for an assessment for the lecturers' salaries on the clergy of 40 marks annually for seven years. Yet the archbishop had more success in advancing Dean Alen's project for a poorhouse for honest Catholics of the English nation, and he also recovered some of the lands detained from his see. He probably left his archiepiscopal finances in rather better state than he found them, despite later complaints about generous land leases and his acquiescence in Kildare's detention of lands around Castlekevin and Ballymore Eustace recovered from the Leinster Irish. He died at Finglas (Dublin) on 14 May 1511 and was buried on 16 May in the nave of St Patrick's Cathedral.<br>
