<span class="headword">Coffin,  Richard</span>  (1622&#150;1699), <span class="occ">book collector and antiquary</span>, was the son of John Coffin (1593&#150;1622) of Portledge, Alwington, north Devon, and Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry Hurding of Dorset. As he was born after his father's death, Coffin immediately succeeded to the house and manor of Alwington, which had been the family's home since the time of Henry II. The extent of his education is unknown.<br>
<br>Coffin remained in Devon throughout the civil wars. He married first, by licence dated 28 June 1644, Mary Dennis of Orley, and second, on 3 February 1648, Dorothy Rowe (<i>d</i>. 1666), with whom he had two sons and nine daughters. Although he had royalist sympathies, Coffin took up Cromwell's invitation in the late 1650s to county gentlemen to sit on the commission of the peace and there was a suggestion in a letter from a J. Hanmer dated 23 March 1659 that he stand for parliament.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Coffin was a JP and a commissioner for money for disbanding and paying off. He married, for a third time, by licence dated 29 July 1674, Anne, daughter of Edmund Prideaux of Padstow, Cornwall, and with her he had two more sons and two more daughters. His chief public office was to act as sheriff for Devon during the year 1684&#150;5, when he was required to participate in the bloody assize. Correspondence with his under-sheriff, Thomas Northmore, survives concerning the disposal of the heads and quarters of those executed for their part in the Monmouth rebellion.<br>
<br>Coffin rarely left Alwington, his chief interests being antiquarian pursuits and book collecting. The historian John Prince (<i>d</i>. 1723) wrote of him: &#145;He hath a noble library and knows well to make use of it&#146;  (Prince, 181). Prince was aware of his extensive collections of local genealogical information and, when sending him a manuscript of John Hooker's &#145;Synopsis chorographical of Devonshire&#146; on 20 March 1686, he suggested that Coffin was &#145;excellently qualefyed, both with learning judgment, manuscripts leisure and estate&#146; to prepare a historical collection for the press  (<span class="italic">Portledge Papers</span>, 6&#150;7). None of his compilations was printed although a manuscript entitled &#145;Genealogical survey of gentlemen entitled to coat armour in the south-west of England&#146; survives among the Pine Coffin manuscripts in the Devon Record Office. To build up his extensive library, which was especially strong in historical and topographical writings, he used as his London agent the bookdealer Richard Lapthorne, some 400 of whose letters, written between 1683 and 1697, survive in the Pine Coffin manuscripts.<br>
<br>Coffin died on 25 December 1699 at Portledge, and was buried at Alwington on 4 January 1700. He was survived by his wife, Anne, who died on 10 August 1705, and succeeded by his eldest son, John. Later generations added little to the library, which was sold by the Exeter bookseller Shirley Woolmer in 1801 with a catalogue listing 4515 items.<br>
