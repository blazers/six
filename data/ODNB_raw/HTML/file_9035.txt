<span class="headword">Eyre,  John</span>  (1754&#150;1803), <span class="occ">evangelical and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in January 1754 in Bodmin, Cornwall, the son of John Eyre, who was in business, and his wife, Grace White. He was baptized on 25 February. Eyre was educated in classics by the Revd John Fisher, master of Bodmin grammar school, and in mathematics by the Revd Joseph Thorpe, rector of Forrabury and Trevalga, Cornwall, in his private school at Forrabury. Despite his childhood education, Eyre was apprenticed by his parents to Mr Oliver, a clothier of Tavistock, at the age of fifteen.<br>
<br>While living in Tavistock, the young man engaged in a life of revelling until he experienced a profound religious conversion and began to preach. For two years Eyre and his evangelical associates conducted revival meetings. At the expiration of his term of apprenticeship, his father persuaded him to return to Bodmin to go into business. When not employed, the young man secured the town hall and preached to all who wished to hear. &#145;The rich and the poor flocked to hear him&#146;  (Collison, June 1803, 229). Such activity infuriated his father, who commanded him to give up preaching. Unwilling to comply, Eyre was driven from his father's home.<br>
<br>After taking refuge with a friend in Plymouth, Eyre applied and secured admission to Trevecca College, the countess of Huntingdon's college in south Wales, in 1777. Under the patronage of the countess, he ministered at Tregony and St Agnes, Cornwall, Lincoln, Worcester, and Mulberry Gardens Chapel, London. Eyre's abilities exceeded those of many of his fellow students and he grew frustrated with the countess's decision to take him away from his studies in favour of itinerant preaching in England and Wales. He desired to take orders in the Church of England, and he matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1778. On 30 May 1779 he was ordained deacon by Dr Robert Lowth, bishop of London; and he received priest's orders from the bishop of Lincoln on 19 December 1779. In the following years he held curacies in Weston, Lewes, Reading, and Chelsea. In November 1785 Eyre married Mary Keene (1757/8&#150;1827), from near Reading, and the following month he was appointed minister of Homerton, or, as it was often called after its founder, Ram's Chapel, and he opened a school at Well Street, Hackney.<br>
<br>Eyre was active in his ministerial duties and particularly committed to the young and the poor of his parish. He sometimes admitted lay preachers to his pulpit, and occasionally shortened the liturgy. His congregation imitated his &#145;generous and enlarged views, his humble Christian temper; and, like him, devoted large portions of their property to the cause of Christ&#146;  (Morison, 30). Still his most renowned achievements centred on national evangelical institutions. He conceived and initiated the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>, a joint venture of the Church of England and dissenting ministers, the first number of which appeared in July 1793. He edited and contributed largely to its volumes until 1802.<br>
<br>In 1792 Trevecca College moved from its home in the Welsh mountains to a more central location at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire (where it took the name Cheshunt College). Upon this occasion Eyre and the Revd Anthony Crole conducted the service to commemorate the event. The proceedings, including Eyre's sermon, were published as <span class="italic">The Order Observed at the Opening of the Countess of Huntingdon's College</span>, in 1792. Eyre was one of the founders of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "London Missionary Society")</script> (1794&#150;5) and the Village Itinerancy Society. He was instrumental in the establishment of Hackney Theological College (1803) and an academy in Idle, Yorkshire (<i>c</i>.1800). After a long illness he died at Homerton on 28 or 29 March 1803, and was buried in a vault on the south side of the communion table in Homerton Chapel on 5 April. His funeral sermon was preached by the Revd Rowland Hill. His wife died at Well Street, Hackney, on 20 June 1827, aged sixty-nine, and was buried by her husband's side on 29 June. An extended memoir of Eyre by the Revd George Collison, president of Hackney Theological Seminary, appeared in the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> for June and July 1803.<br>
