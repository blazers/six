<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cockfield,  (Francis) Arthur</span>, Baron Cockfield  (1916&#150;2007), <span class="occ">businessman, politician, and international civil servant</span>, was born on 28 September 1916 at 26 Devonshire Road, Horsham, Sussex, the second son of Charles Francis Cockfield (1890&#150;1916) and his wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James (1890&#150;1974). He never knew his father, a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, who had been killed in action at the battle of the Somme on 27 August 1916. He was educated at Dover grammar school and subsequently at the London School of Economics, where he read law and economics and graduated both LLB and BSc (Econ).<h2>
<a name="Civilservantbusinessmanandpolitician"></a>Civil servant, businessman, and politician</h2>In 1938 Cockfield embarked on a career in the Inland Revenue while also studying law (he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1942). At the outbreak of the Second World War most of the administration of the Inland Revenue was evacuated to Wales, but Cockfield had the good fortune to find himself part of a relatively small, central staff that remained in London, where his formidable intelligence and energies found rapid and widespread recognition. By 1945 he was already an assistant secretary and director of statistics, and in 1951 he was appointed a commissioner of Inland Revenue at the astonishingly early age of thirty-five. Meanwhile, on 23 July 1943, at the King's Chapel of St John the Baptist, Savoy, London, he had married Ruth Helen Simonis (1914&#150;1998), daughter of Henry Solomon Simonis, academic lawyer. They had a daughter, Hilary Ann (<i>b</i>. 1944), and a son, Roger Edmund (<i>b</i>. 1947). The marriage ended in divorce in the early 1960s, a profound rift with his family which remained total until his death.<br>
<br>Despite his rapid rise to the upper ranks of the Inland Revenue, Cockfield soon began to feel frustration at the slow pace of public administration and the political constraints on the Whitehall machine. Along with an increasing number of senior mandarins, he decided to follow the lure of a more challenging and risky life in the commercial world. In 1953 he left the Inland Revenue and moved to the Boots Pure Drug Company, initially as its finance director (1953&#150;61) and then, as managing director and chairman of the executive management committee (1961&#150;7), presiding over a steady expansion of its retail, manufacturing, and international export businesses.<br>
<br>Even while micro-managing Boots, Cockfield still nurtured his interest in the functioning of the economy at large, for instance chairing a study, for the Royal Institute of Public Administration, of potential new sources of local revenue&#151;which, interestingly, came down firmly against the idea of a poll tax as regressive and likely to be massively unpopular. He also served on Selwyn Lloyd's National Economic Development Council from 1962 to 1964. Within a short time of the Conservative government's defeat in 1964 he became intimately involved in the party's rethinking of its economic policies, working closely as economic adviser to the shadow chancellor, Iain Macleod, on the development of a taxation strategy in preparation for a return to government. From 1968 to 1969 he was president of the Royal Statistical Society and in 1970 he married his second wife, (Aileen) Monica Mudie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blurton (1919&#150;1992), a choreographer. There were no children of this second marriage.<br>
<br>When Macleod died in 1970 within days of becoming chancellor of the exchequer in the new Conservative government under Edward Heath, Cockfield was both personally and professionally bereft, but he continued to serve as adviser to Macleod's successor, Anthony Barber, for whom he devised a radical tax credit system. In 1973 he received a knighthood. In March of that year, as inflation reached well into double figures and industrial relations became increasingly polarized, the Heath government set up a pay board and a price commission in an attempt to bring wage and price inflation under control. Cockfield was appointed chairman of the price commission. Although a profound believer in the free market, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to making sense of the job with the intellectual rigour and meticulous attention to detail that were already his hallmark. Such was his zeal in holding back price rises that he felt able to claim before the end of the first year that he had already saved the shopper &pound;320 million.<br>
<br>When the new Labour government came to power in 1974 it promptly abolished the pay board but retained the price commission. It was a tribute to his manifestly fair-minded and balanced approach to competition that Cockfield, though openly a staunch Conservative, was retained in post by the incoming secretary of state, Shirley Williams. For three more years he continued to use his remorselessly penetrating analytical powers to corner companies into cutting back or even abandoning their proposed price increases as inflation peaked at 25 per cent in 1975 and then began to fall back. In July 1977 he left the price commission to return full-time to his role as an adviser to the Conservative Party, playing a leading part in the work of its economic reconstruction group under Geoffrey Howe, planning the party's economic strategy and policies on public expenditure and reform of the tax system. He was made a life peer in 1978, as Baron Cockfield.<br>
<br>When the Conservatives returned to power in 1979, Cockfield became minister of state at the Treasury, in charge of the Inland Revenue and a strong influence behind the tax-reforming budgets that followed. In 1982 he was promoted to the cabinet, being sworn of the privy council and becoming secretary of state for trade. When, only a year later, the Department of Trade was once again merged with Industry after the general election of June 1983, he became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Freed from departmental responsibilities and with a seat in the cabinet and most key cabinet committees, he earned himself few friends over the next fifteen months as he frequently and fearlessly ambushed his colleagues' proposals over a wide policy front.<h2>
<a name="EuropeancommissionerthesinglemarketandtheSingleEuropeanAct"></a>European commissioner: the single market and the Single European Act</h2>The most important turning point in Cockfield's professional life came in the summer of 1984, with the decision of the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to send him to Brussels as the senior British member (at that point Britain chose two European commissioners, by convention one Conservative and one Labour) and vice-president of the new European Commission which was to take office in January 1985. He resigned as chancellor of the duchy and absented himself from the House of Lords in order to devote himself entirely to preparing for Brussels. He was in many ways an unexpected choice for the job, having taken very little interest in European Community matters until then, but by the time he arrived in Brussels (asking warily whether it was safe to drink the water) he had read the treaty of Rome from cover to cover three times&#151;he would later often tartly remark that some of his colleagues had clearly never even read it once&#151;and had briefed himself exhaustively on every conceivable area of community activity. His predecessors also advised him to learn French, as the all-important language of the Brussels corridors; he tried, but soon gave up, so that when a visiting minister once asked if he might speak French, Cockfield replied &#145;By all means. [<i>pause</i>] But I shan't understand a word you say&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>To appreciate the scale of what was to turn out to be Cockfield's crowning achievement, it is important to recall the extent to which the process of European integration had slowed to a snail's pace in the preceding years, reflecting economic stagnation, sluggish progress on enlargement, and above all the stalling power of the United Kingdom government in pursuit of its claims for a rebate on its contributions to the community budget. That and other thorny issues had at last been resolved at the Fontainebleau European council in June 1984. The new president of the commission, Jacques Delors, who had been one of the main players, as French finance minister, in reaching agreement on the British budget refund, was determined to make a fresh start and to use his presidency to restore momentum to the community's development. Even before the new commission took up office, Delors and Cockfield had agreed that completing the internal market was the biggest single area of community business left unfinished. It was also the objective most likely to be supported by most member governments&#151;not least by the United Kingdom&#151;and by the overwhelming majority of the commercial and industrial community.<br>
<br>Delors and Cockfield shared the analysis that, for the economies of Europe to compete successfully with those of the United States and Japan, all the obstacles that prevented them from functioning as a single market needed systematically to be removed. With characteristic ambition and thoroughness, and with total confidence in his own ability to hold all the parts together, Cockfield not only successfully claimed the internal market portfolio for himself but persuaded Delors that it should be significantly enlarged to include company and indirect taxation, financial institutions and the customs union, many of the manufacturing industries with the strongest interest in a single market (such as food, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, wholesale and retail distribution, textiles, and the construction industry), and the implications for the internal market of all other policies. That such a raid on the traditional definition of portfolios should have been achieved without the bloodletting usually associated with incoming commissions was a measure of Delors's ability to persuade his colleagues to accept from the outset the primacy and the scale of ambition of the single market project as the flagship of his term of office. It also suited Cockfield's personality, giving him the autonomy to master and resolve for himself the dossier's many inherent complex and intractable policy conflicts, which would have tested his limited skills in handling people had they involved trying to reconcile his own and his colleagues' interests. Not that he was afraid of confrontation: he positively relished it in the council of ministers and, if necessary, even within the commission itself, where only the very brave dared to cross him&#151;and often regretted it. Members of his team soon learned that, faced with an impasse at their own level, the suggestion that &#145;maybe your commissioner had better discuss it with mine&#146; could yield capitulation within minutes  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Within days of taking office Delors and Cockfield set the commission a deadline of June and the next European council summit in Milan to produce a white paper outlining a comprehensive plan for completing the internal market. Cockfield called on the whole commission to draw up an inventory of all the measures that would be needed to remove all the barriers that prevented member states from functioning as a single market. Within weeks hundreds of pieces of legislation had been identified, some of them already on the negotiating table, some lurking in desk drawers waiting for the commission to have the courage to put them forward, many others still to be conceived and drafted. As word spread that the internal market was the bandwagon to climb aboard, long-neglected drafts were dusted off and put forward as vital to the cause. In response Cockfield was ruthless in repelling all boarders who were not absolutely needed on the voyage, and the programme finally settled at a formidable 300 measures.<br>
<br>With a programme of such immense scope, Cockfield's study of community history had taught him that the council's tendency would be to back the easy winners and leave the rest to lag behind or fall by the wayside altogether. He, however, stuck uncompromisingly to the insight that, for the physical, technical, and fiscal barriers to the free market to be abolished, every single pretext for their continued existence had to go. With the rigorous logic of the super-bureaucrat that he was, and certain that it had to be all or nothing, he therefore built in a detailed timetable, with deadlines measure by measure, monitored by annual progress reports, reinforced by periodic high-profile strategic reviews in 1988, 1990, and 1992, and, most importantly, committed to an overall political deadline of the end of 1992 for completion of the entire project. (1992 would mark the end of two commission terms of office and, at that time, Cockfield, who was in Thatcher's good books, could expect to be reappointed to see the programme through.)<br>
<br>By early June 1985 Cockfield and his team had the whole programme sewn up. His fellow commissioners were bowled over by the sheer magnitude and audacity of the plan, whose unanswerably detailed logic they were all able to follow without interpretation as Cockfield laid it out before them in his slow, lugubrious drone. By the end of June the commission had bounced the Milan European council into committing itself to &#145;a precise programme of action based on the White Paper &hellip; with a view to achieving completely and effectively the conditions for a single market in the Community by 1992 at the latest in accordance with &hellip; a binding timetable&#146;, and to convening the intergovernmental conference that would give birth the following year to the <span class="roman">Single European Act</span>, the change in the rules (introducing qualified majority voting in the council for a wide variety of measures) needed to make the target credible and legally binding.<br>
<br>Alongside the widespread applause from all quarters for the ambition of the project, there was no shortage of voices asserting that it simply could not be done. This was a red rag to a bull, and for the next three and a half years Cockfield ploughed doggedly on with his programme, determined to prove the Jeremiahs wrong, harrying his own troops to keep to the timetable, facing down the member states in the council of ministers, and roundly denouncing faint-heartedness, foot-dragging, or outright obstruction wherever he sniffed it out. Inevitably he particularly relished tearing strips off British ministers and, though this undoubtedly boosted his credibility with his colleagues in Brussels and the other capitals of Europe, it was eventually to cost him his job.<br>
<br>As far as Cockfield's lifeline to London was concerned, the rot had, in fact, set in almost from the start. Thatcher had first taken issue with Cockfield as early as the publication of the white paper itself, over what she saw as his unwelcome &#145;invention&#146; of the need for tax harmonization. His own account of the clash recorded:<blockquote>
<div>Myself: It was in the Treaty of Rome.<br>
</div>
<div>The PM: It was not.<br>
</div>
<div>Myself: It was.<br>
</div>
<div>The PM: It was not.<br>
</div>
<div>Myself: It was.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>This unproductive conversation was brought to an end by the Private Secretary being sent to find a copy of the Treaty of Rome. I asked him to read out Article 99, which reads as follows: &#145;The Commission shall present proposals for the harmonisation of indirect taxes &hellip;&#146; This was greeted in complete silence. I was to learn over the years that silence was always the Prime Minister's response when in difficulties. But thinking, as I then did, that it was possible to penetrate this iron defence, I said:<div>Myself: You ought to have read it before you signed it.<br>
</div>
<div>The PM: I didn't sign it.<br>
</div>
<div>Myself: I know you didn't. But you were a member of the Cabinet which did sign it.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>Silence. (Cockfield, 56&#150;7)</blockquote>The writing had been on the wall ever since then, made more indelible by what Thatcher saw as his complicity in trapping her into agreeing to the <span class="roman">Single European Act</span>. His appetite for pillorying British ministers in council meetings eventually lost him the support of the Foreign Office, which considered such public shows of national discord unseemly. By June 1988 he knew that he would not be reappointed, confirmation of which first reached him, as was the new vogue for the out-of-favour, through a Downing Street leak. But in that same month the Hanover European council declared that progress towards the single market was now &#145;irreversible&#146;, so that, sad though he was not to have a chance to steer the flagship home himself, he felt confident that he had set it on its course and that the momentum he had generated would see it in on time to a safe harbour. It certainly did not detract from his sense of ownership of the project: his own account of how it was all achieved, <span class="italic">The European Union: Creating the Single Market</span> (1994), was written almost entirely in the first person singular.<br>
<br>Four years after Cockfield's departure from Brussels, in December 1992, the vision became reality and, despite delays in implementation by some member states, the Edinburgh European council declared the single market complete in all essential respects. Not everything was as Cockfield had originally designed it&#151;his radical proposals on VAT and excise duties, too extreme in their logic to be swallowed by finance ministers, were denatured as soon as his back was turned&#151;and in some important respects, such as the energy market, there was still more to be done. But the whole unprecedentedly ambitious project as set out in the white paper had been substantially realized.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandassessment"></a>Final years, and assessment</h2>Cockfield's role in the creation of the European single market was recognized in a series of honorary doctorates and fellowships from universities on both sides of the Atlantic as well as by the award by Belgium of the grand cross of the order of Leopold II. From 1988 he worked for some time as an adviser on European affairs to the London accountants Peat, Marwick, McLintock, and he was much in demand as a speaker at conferences on the single market. 1992 was, however, also the year in which his wife Monica, his constant companion, suddenly died, leaving him a lonely and isolated figure in his final years, though he continued to attend regularly and to speak in debates in the House of Lords until shortly before his death at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 8 January 2007, of gastro-intestinal bleeding. He was survived by his two children.<br>
<br>Over an exceptionally long working life Cockfield had several distinguished careers, each of which would have earned him a solid footnote in the history books. But in the twilight of those years, arguably in just six months of superhuman intellectual effort, he made a whole chapter his own. The completion of the single market has been called the greatest leap forward in the process of European integration, profoundly altering the balance of economic power between the world's major trading blocs. Cockfield was perhaps an unlikely candidate for the status of European hero, but with his formidable, all-encompassing ability to hold both the detail and the wider picture together, combined with an unwavering loyalty to the rightness of his cause, he proved that the apparently impossible can, just occasionally, be achieved.<br>
