<span class="headword">Travers,  Benjamin</span>  (1783&#150;1858), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 3 April 1783, the son of Benjamin Travers and his wife, Mary, a daughter of the Revd Francis Spilsbury. After receiving a classical education at the grammar school of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, he was taught privately until at the age of sixteen he was placed in his father's counting-house. He soon found commerce uncongenial, and, as his father frequently attended the lectures of the surgeons Henry Cline and Astley Paston Cooper, Travers was articled to Cooper in August 1800 for a term of six years, as his first pupil, residing in his house. During the last year of his apprenticeship Travers gave occasional private demonstrations on anatomy to his fellow pupils and established a clinical society, meeting weekly, of which he was the secretary.<br>
<br>Travers was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1806 and spent the following session at Edinburgh. He returned to London at the end of 1807, and settled at New Court, St Swithin's Lane. He was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at Guy's Hospital, and, with his father's business in decline, he obtained the appointment in 1809 of surgeon to the East India Company's warehouses and brigade; he retained the post until 1814. Also in 1809 he married Sarah, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19244/', "William Morgan (1750&#150;1833)")</script>, actuary. Following her death, he married in 1813 Caroline Millet, whose father was an East India Company director.<br>
<br>Travers succeeded Astley Cooper at the London Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye (later Moorfields Eye Hospital), developing its resources as a teaching institution centre, with many students from England and abroad. Travers was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1813, and he was elected surgeon to St Thomas's Hospital, London, in 1815. He retained the post of surgeon to the eye infirmary until 1816. Astley Cooper moved, in the same year, and Travers took over his house at 3 New Broad Street and soon acquired a fair share of practice. At this time Travers suffered so much from palpitation of the heart that he discontinued his clinical lectures, and in 1819 he resigned his joint lectureship on surgery with Astley Cooper, though he again began to lecture upon surgery in 1834 in conjunction with Frederick Tyrell, at St Thomas's Hospital. Travers was chosen president of the Hunterian Society in 1827, and in the same year he acted as president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. His third marriage, in 1831, was to Mary Poulett, youngest daughter of Colonel Stevens of Somerset.<br>
<br>Travers filled all the important offices at the Royal College of Surgeons. He was elected a member of the council in 1830; Hunterian orator in 1838; examiner in surgery from 1841 to 1858; chairman of the board of midwifery examiners in 1855; vice-president in the years 1845, 1846, 1854, and 1855; and president in 1847 and 1856. He was a member of the veterinary examining committee in 1833. He was appointed surgeon to Queen Victoria in 1837 and to Prince Albert in 1840.<br>
<br>Travers followed other leading surgeons of the day in adopting the technique of cataract surgery by lens extraction, devised by Jacques Deviel in 1745. These men raised the status of optical surgery from the condition of quackery to which untrained oculists and quacks had brought it. Travers's <span class="italic">Synopsis of the Diseases of the Eye and their Treatment</span> (1820), one of the earliest systematic treatises in English, went through three English editions, an Italian translation in 1823, and an American edition in 1825. Travers was also a good pathologist, inheriting the best traditions of the Hunterian school, for he worked upon an experimental basis. He died at his house in Green Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 6 March 1858, and was buried at Hendon in Middlesex. Travers had a large family and his eldest son, Benjamin Travers, followed him in the medical profession.<br>
