<span class="headword">Birch,  Samuel</span>  (1757&#150;1841), <span class="occ">politician, playwright, and pastrycook</span>, was born in London on 8 November 1757. He was the son of Lucas Birch, who carried on the business of a pastrycook and confectioner at 15 Cornhill, an area of the City of London long associated with food production, the street name deriving from a corn market that once stood on the site. The business was established in the reign of George I by a Mr Horton, the immediate predecessor of Lucas Birch. Samuel Birch was educated at a private school kept by Mr Crawford at Newington Butts, and on leaving school was apprenticed to his father. Early in life, in 1778, he married the daughter of Dr John Fordyce, with whom he had a family of thirteen children.<br>
<br>Samuel Birch was elected one of the common council on 21 December 1781, and in 1789 became deputy of the Cornhill ward. In May 1807 he was elected alderman of the Candlewick ward in the place of Alderman Hankey. When young he devoted much of his leisure time to study and the improvement of his literary taste; he was a frequent attendant of a debating society which met in one of the large rooms formerly belonging to the King's Arms tavern, Cornhill. In politics he was a strenuous supporter of Pitt's administration, though he vigorously opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. He became a frequent speaker at the common council meetings. When he first proposed the formation of volunteer regiments at the outbreak of the French Revolution, not a single common councilman supported him. Subsequently, when the measure was adopted, he became the lieutenant-colonel commandant of the 1st regiment of Loyal London volunteers. The speech which he delivered in the Guildhall on 5 March 1805 against the Roman Catholic petition was published in that year and was severely criticized in an article entitled &#145;Deputy Birch and others on the Catholic claims&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (10.124&#150;36). It was, however, highly commended by the king, and the freedom of the city of Dublin was twice voted him at the midsummer quarter assembly of the corporation of that city on 19 July 1805 and 18 July 1806, for his advocacy of the protestant ascendancy in Ireland. In 1807 he published the related <span class="italic">Speech in the Common Council on the Admission of Papists to Hold Commissions in the Army</span>.<br>
<br>In 1811 Birch was appointed one of the sheriffs of London, and on 9 November 1814 he entered on his duties as lord mayor. Tory though he was, he opposed the <span class="roman">Corn Bill</span> of 1815, and presided at a meeting of the livery in common hall on 23 February 1815, when he made a vigorous attack on the intended prohibition of the free importation of foreign corn. The course he took on this occasion was commemorated by a medal struck in his honour, on the obverse side of which is the bust of the lord mayor, and on the reverse a representation of a wheatsheaf, with the legend &#145;Free Importation, Peace and Plenty&#146;. During his mayoralty the marble statue of George III by Chantrey, the inscription on which was written by Birch, was placed in the council chamber of Guildhall. Almost his last act as lord mayor was to lay the foundation-stone of the London Institution in Finsbury Circus (then called the Amphitheatre, Moorfields) on 4 November 1815. In addition to his political and literary careers, Birch ran the family catering business aided by his nephew George Ring. The firm provided the catering for the lavish Waterloo Feast held during Birch's mayoralty. In 1836 Birch sold the business to the firm of Ring and Brymer who continued the catering connection as specialist caterers to Trusthouse Forte.<br>
<br>Birch was a man of considerable literary attainments, and he wrote a number of poems and musical dramas, of which the <span class="italic">Adopted Child</span> was by far the most successful. A musical farce containing in Act IV a song that became an immediate popular favourite, the play was published in 1795, the year of its first performance. It was also performed in 1796, 1797, and 1799. Birch's plays were frequently produced at Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and Haymarket theatres in the 1790s. Among his other published dramas was <span class="italic">The Smugglers</span> (1796), a melodrama first produced at Drury Lane on 13 April 1796, and thereafter at Drury Lane in 1797, 1798, and 1799. The play was Birch's most popular melodrama and a box-office success. Birch also wrote the following dramatic pieces, which were never published: <span class="italic">The Mariners</span> (1793), a musical farce first produced at the opera house in the Haymarket on 10 May 1793; <span class="italic">The Packet Boat, or, A Peep behind the Veil</span> (1794), a farce first produced at Covent Garden on 13 May 1794; <span class="italic">Fast Asleep</span> (1797), a musical farce based on James Powell's <span class="italic">The Narcotic</span> and produced at Drury Lane on 28 October 1795; and <span class="italic">Albert and Adelaide, or, The Victim of Constancy</span> (1798), a melodrama first produced at Covent Garden on 11 December 1798. <span class="italic">Albert and Adelaide</span> was unfavourably reviewed as a species of pantomime and dumb show in the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> of December 1798. C. Beeches Hogan, editor of <span class="italic">The London Stage</span>, has disputed the claim made in the playbill that the play was &#145;Taken from the German&#146; and credits the source to <span class="italic">The Captive of Spilburg</span>. In his dramatic works Birch collaborated closely with the composer Thomas Attwood who provided much of the music for his plays.<br>
<br>In addition to his literary career as a playwright, Birch was also a sometime actor and writer of sermons. His varied activity was the subject of a clever skit, in which a French visitor to London meeting with &#145;Birch the pastrycook&#146; in such different capacities as Guildhall-orator, militia-colonel, poet, and so on returned to France, believing him to be the emperor of London.<br>
<br>Birch retired from the court of aldermen in December 1839, and died at his house, 107 Guilford Street, London, on 10 December 1841, aged eighty-four.<br>
