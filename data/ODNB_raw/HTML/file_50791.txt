<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashby,  Eric</span>, Baron Ashby  (1904&#150;1992), <span class="occ">botanist and university administrator</span>, was born on 24 August 1904 at 12 Fairlop Road, north Leyton, London, the eldest of three sons of Herbert Charles Ashby, commercial clerk (and later accountant), and his wife, Hel&euml;na Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chater.<h2>
<a name="Education"></a>Education</h2>Ashby was educated at the City of London School, 1916&#150;23, and initially he studied principally English and the classics. His grounding in English was to stand him in good stead in later life. Despite his obvious ability in some of the arts subjects he moved to the sciences, where he found the rigour and logic of mathematics much more to his liking. As with his proficiency in English, the firm grounding in mathematics that he acquired was to prove valuable in his subsequent career, and particularly in his effective use of statistics. From school he moved to Imperial College, London. At that time the college had a group of outstanding botanists noted for their enthusiastic and stimulating teaching. This attracted Ashby and he switched his main interest from chemistry to botany, but he continued with chemistry and particularly with mathematics. He also took geology as a subsidiary subject. He was most influenced by Vernon Herbert Blackman, one of the leading plant physiologists. In 1926 he graduated with a BSc, gaining first-class honours in botany and geology, and was awarded the Forbes medal. He spent the following summer staying with a family in Germany and gained a most useful knowledge of German; he subsequently prepared a translation of Henrik Lunderg&aring;rdh's much valued book <span class="italic">Klima und Boden in ihrer Wirkung auf das Pflanzenleben</span>, published as <span class="italic">Environment and Plant Development</span> (1931), and later a vocabulary of German botanical terms with his wife, Helen.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandbotanicalresearch"></a>Early career and botanical research</h2>On his return from Germany, Ashby was appointed a demonstrator at Imperial College, in 1926. This enabled him to begin his research on plant growth and development. To avoid some of the difficulties faced by previous workers he was determined to design experiments which could be subjected to rigorous critical analysis, and his close contacts with the John Innes Institute helped him greatly in carrying out experiments in a way which provided results suitable for careful statistical analysis. His outstanding contribution in this field was his work with <i>Lemna</i>, a water plant only a few millimetres in size. The smallness of the plant enabled him to grow sufficiently large numbers of individuals to permit statistically valued results and to grow them in carefully controlled conditions of temperature, light, and nutrition. The equipment which he designed was a forerunner of the much more complex and expensive phytotrons.<br>
<br>In 1929 Ashby was awarded a Commonwealth Fund fellowship and he worked at the University of Chicago and the Desert Research Laboratory of the Carnegie Foundation. There he met many of the leading American botanists and acquired a firm grasp of genetics. He returned to Imperial College in 1931 and was appointed as a lecturer. On 26 December the same year he married (Elizabeth) Helen Margaret Farries (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), lecturer, daughter of Francis Farries, farmer, of Risk, Castle Douglas, Scotland, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lindsay. Helen Farries was a graduate of Glasgow University who had won a scholarship to Imperial College to work for a PhD on fungal physiology under Professor William Brown. She and Ashby had met when collaborating on the development of an incinerating system for determining the carbon content of tissues. They had two sons: Michael Farries (<i>b</i>. 1935) and Peter Harries Chater (<i>b</i>. 1937).<br>
<br>Ashby's work on growth physiology soon attracted considerable interest and students. At that time there were widespread discussions in ecological centres on how to develop methods of describing and defining plant communities. The leading figure on the continent was Christen Raunkiaer, who developed a percentage frequency method designed to enable a rapid and objective way of describing a particular community and the abundance and importance of the individual species in it. This was widely adopted on the continent but was regarded by British ecologists as not very satisfactory. Ashby became interested in the problem and examined Raunkiaer's published results critically from a statistical and logical viewpoint. His paper in 1935 in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> virtually destroyed Raunkiaer's proposals and clearly established Ashby as a coming leader in plant physiology and other aspects of botany as well.<br>
<br>In 1935 Ashby moved to the University of Bristol as a reader in botany, where his teaching was mainly in genetics. His interest in hybrid vigour (heterosis) had been aroused earlier, and his stay in Chicago had broadened his outlook and given him a good insight into the genetics of maize. The 1930s were a period in which genetics was developing rapidly and one in which many curious and surprising results were becoming comprehensible as they were fitted into the basic framework of genetics. Among these was the phenomenon of hybrid vigour, where some hybrids were found to grow more vigorously and bigger than either of the parents. Ashby was fascinated by this, but when he examined the published results of other workers he was surprised to find how little careful quantitative work had been done. With helpful advice from Ronald Aylmer Fisher, the leading biological statistician at the time, Ashby began further work on hybrid vigour. His findings led him to conclude that the increased vigour was due to the increased size of the embryos rather than to any genetic feature. His published results on this, like his earlier paper on plant communities, caused considerable interest and his conclusions were vigorously attacked, particularly in the USA. Subsequent research indicated that the problem was much more complex than he envisaged and that his conclusion that hybrid vigour was due solely to embryo size was an oversimplification.<h2>
<a name="SydneyMoscowandManchester19381950"></a>Sydney, Moscow, and Manchester, 1938&#150;1950</h2>In 1938 Ashby was appointed to the professorship of botany in the University of Sydney (having also been offered a chair at the University of Manitoba, in Canada). At Sydney he found a department strong in the Scottish tradition of anatomy, morphology, and systematics, but almost devoid of any modern physiology, which he rapidly set about rectifying. During the Second World War state and federal governments relied on him increasingly. In 1940&#150;41 he served as a member of the power alcohol committee of inquiry set up to investigate the feasibility of producing power alcohol from surplus cereals and sugar cane. In 1940&#150;42 he was chairman of the Australian National Research Council, and in 1942 he conducted an inquiry into the enlistment of scientific resources in war, at the request of the Australian prime minister, John Curtin. Ashby was then responsible for establishing and directing the scientific liaison bureau, which was charged with identifying and allocating Australian scientific resources.<br>
<br>Ashby's wartime work for the Australian government led directly to his appointment by the Australian ministry of external affairs as scientific counsellor and charg&eacute; d'affaires at the Australian legation in Moscow at the end of 1944. There he met many of the leading figures in the USSR, including Stalin, Molotov, Vishinsky, and Lysenko. He recorded his experiences, and his assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet regime, in <span class="italic">Scientist in Russia</span>, published by Penguin in 1947. Returning to Sydney in February 1946, and declining to become Australian minister in Moscow, he was closely, although briefly, involved in the work of the planning committee for the new graduate university in Canberra, which became the Australian National University. However, his major contribution was in the development of the University of Sydney, in the changes needed to meet the obvious expansion required to provide for the large numbers of returning ex-servicemen, and how the university should contribute to developments nationwide.<br>
<br>Numerous attempts were made to entice Ashby to accept major administrative positions in Australia, including the vice-chancellorship of the University of Sydney; but he yearned to return to research, and in 1946 he accepted an invitation to become Harrison professor of botany in the University of Manchester. He spent three years there, during which his enthusiasm and flair for botany made Manchester one of the leading botanical schools in the United Kingdom. Unlike in Sydney, he was given considerable time for his own scientific research, although he served as a member of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy under Sir Henry Tizard and on a Foreign Office committee on science in Germany.<br>
<br>In trying to assess Ashby's overall contribution to botany stress must be placed on his ability to stimulate others and to provide them with the facilities needed. His major ability was to point the way the subject could develop and to encourage others to develop his ideas. Perhaps the most telling judgement of his work was expressed by Professor Heslop-Harrison: &#145;Surveying his contribution as a whole leaves one with a feeling of regret that he was unable to carry some of his work further: so many of his projects were just at their peak when for one reason or another he came to abandon them&#146;  (Heslop-Harrison, 16). Despite this he must be ranked as one of the outstanding professors of botany in the twentieth century.<h2>
<a name="Belfast19501959"></a>Belfast, 1950&#150;1959</h2>Ashby's decision to accept an invitation to succeed David Lindsay Keir as president and vice-chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast, from 1950, surprised many of his colleagues: he had already declined a number of similar invitations to become a full-time educational administrator. Nevertheless, as he later explained, &#145;I decided &hellip; that I was more interested in people than ideas; in teaching and educational issues than in pure science, and in solving problems about people rather than problems about plants&#146;  (Heslop-Harrison, 3). The following nine years provided ample opportunity for Ashby to pursue these interests, and to exercise his formidable talents for leadership and organization.<br>
<br>When Ashby arrived at Queen's the university still had something of a reputation for sleepiness and provincialism; it was in no small part thanks to his leadership that in the course of the 1950s it was established as an energetic and forward-looking centre of academic excellence. He was fortunate in having the full backing of the Northern Irish government, based at Stormont, which provided funds for a massive building programme. He later recalled that only once did he have to apply for extra funds for running costs: the Northern Irish minister for education agreed to provide the full amount requested immediately. Thus provided with the funds to expand and develop the university Ashby was able to devote considerable care to the recruitment of high-quality academic staff: &#145;persons in their thirties who would be likely to be leaders themselves in ten or more years time&#146;  (Heslop-Harrison, 8). It is a measure of his success in this regard that of the five professorial appointments in science made in his time all five appointees later became fellows of the Royal Society (as Ashby himself did, in 1963). He also did much to improve the quality of staff lower down the ladder by providing them with greater job security and better prospects for promotion.<br>
<br>It was said of Ashby at Queen's that &#145;He is the only Vice-Chancellor who doesn't give orders; he doesn't need to&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 28 Oct 1992). His mastery of the business of the numerous university committees which he was called upon to chair was complete. He always got his way, although he rarely had to resort to the use of his authority to force matters through. Sir Peter Froggatt, one of Ashby's successors as vice-chancellor, later recalled: &#145;He was a skilful exponent of the &#147;planted&#148; idea, content to wait patiently for it to resurface through the committee systems as someone else's&#146;  (ibid.). During his time at Queen's, and without impairing his own ability to push through measures which he regarded as necessary, Ashby made the decision making process both more transparent and more reflective of the various currents of opinion and constituencies in the university, initiating open staff meetings prior to meetings of the academic council, and encouraging individual members of staff and representatives of the students to make their views known to him. He continued throughout this time to be involved in a wide range of activities outside the university, both in Northern Ireland (including as chairman of the Northern Ireland Advisory Council for Education, and vice-president of the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts) and in the United Kingdom more generally (including as chairman of the scientific grants committee and then of the postgraduate grants committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and as an active member of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals).<h2>
<a name="Cambridge19591975"></a>Cambridge, 1959&#150;1975</h2>In autumn 1957, on becoming a candidate for the mastership of Clare College, Cambridge, Ashby remarked that &#145;he had no more thought of becoming a Master of a Cambridge College than of succeeding to the Papacy&#146;  (personal knowledge). Part serious and part irreverent, this was typical of Ashby, though rarely revealed so directly. He was pre-elected master of Clare College in spring 1958, the first master from outside Cambridge&#151;indeed such an election would have been forbidden by the college statutes had he not first been elected to a fellowship so that he could obtain a Cambridge degree by incorporation. After a year completing their duties in Belfast the Ashbys took up residence in the master's lodge at Clare in April 1959. The lodge soon became a home for chamber music by dons and students, including performances by a string quartet in which Ashby played the viola. His fostering of music in the college extended to the chapel choir which, with the inclusion of women students, contributed to Clare's growing reputation for distinction in music.<br>
<br>Ashby's predecessor, Sir Henry Thirkill, was senior tutor before becoming master, and had for nearly forty years managed admissions to Clare by focusing on a number of traditional public schools. The senior tutor, John Northam, was already moving towards a more diverse intake with stricter criteria for academic merit&#151;changes that would inevitably have radical long-term effects. Ashby had no role in deciding which individual students to admit but gave his support through encouragement to new schools and in helping to calm those alumni whose sons no longer received preferential admission.<br>
<br>In the university Ashby's advice was sought on a problem that had been a feature of discussions throughout the 1950s&#151;that nearly half the academic staff did not have college fellowships. It was feared that this was undermining the much valued collegiate character of the university. A syndicate was set up with the former head of the civil service, Lord Bridges, as chairman and Ashby as deputy chairman, with membership drawn from representative groups of faculties and colleges. The university accepted a proposal of the syndicate to build a university centre which would provide dining and meeting facilities for graduate students and senior members, but their main proposals for new institutional relations between the university and the colleges were rejected since (it was said) they had failed to understand the nature of the colleges. However, their report concentrated minds in the colleges, which began to solve the problem in their own ways&#151;by increasing the number of fellowships and by founding three graduate colleges: University College, later renamed Wolfson, was founded by the university following a suggestion from two members of the syndicate; Darwin College was founded jointly by Trinity, St John's, and Gonville and Caius colleges; Clare Hall was founded by Clare College.<br>
<br>The foundation of Clare Hall was initiated in May 1962. It was Ashby who set in progress Clare College's response to the needs of the university when a committee was asked to examine the consequences of expanding the fellowship by a considerable number. By November 1963 this had led to two conflicting proposals on which Ashby exhorted the governing body to reach a decision at a special meeting on 11 January 1964. Two days before that meeting Ashby received a new proposal from one of the fellows to which he gave his immediate support. Richard Eden's paper proposed founding a Clare centre for advanced study, which would provide fellowships for visiting professors, mainly from overseas, and for members of the Cambridge faculties, and would include also research fellows and graduate students. The proposed centre would include both men and women and provide accommodation for families of visitors in new college buildings to be located in Herschel Road (a short distance from the university library). The proposal was unanimously approved by the governing body, which later decided that the new centre should be called Clare Hall; the basic costs would be met by the college and additional support would be sought from foundations.<br>
<br>Ashby was on leave during Easter term 1964 in the United States, where he had discussions with Paul Mellon, a former student at Clare College, and with the Ford Foundation. This resulted in a substantial endowment from the Old Dominion Foundation (later the Andrew Mellon Foundation) to be used for visiting and research fellowships, and a five-year grant from the Ford Foundation for visiting fellowships. Meanwhile in Clare College a working committee on Clare Hall had suggested Ralph Erskine as architect for the new buildings, and identified five possible foundation fellows. The committee's recommendations were approved on Ashby's return, and the following day, by bicycle, he visited each of the five prospective fellows, all of whom consented to accept nomination.<br>
<br>During summer 1964 it became apparent that university statutes would limit the status of fellows of Clare Hall if it were to remain a part of Clare College, and in 1965 Ashby negotiated with the university council of the senate for Clare Hall to become an approved foundation with Clare College as its sole trustee, a status that could change at the request of either party after fourteen years. Its legal status was established on 7 February 1966 with Brian Pippard as its first president. Three years later Ashby formally opened the new buildings on the last day of his two years as vice-chancellor of the university. In 1984 Clare Hall received a royal charter from Elizabeth II and became an independent college in the university, while still retaining close informal relations with Clare College.<br>
<br>One week after the legal foundation of Clare Hall a study group chaired by Ashby was set up &#145;to consider as widely as it sees proper the implications of admitting women members to Clare College and to report, without recommendations, back to the Governing Body&#146;  (Eden, 295). The study group reported in November 1968 and, after a lengthy period of discussion, in May 1970 the governing body repealed the statute that prevented the admission of women. The following year the first two women fellows were admitted and in 1972 Clare admitted thirty women undergraduates; by the 1990s about half of the Clare undergraduates were women.<br>
<br>During Ashby's time as vice-chancellor (1967&#150;9) he steered the university towards the establishment of its own medical school at Addenbrooke's Hospital. But more than anything else this period was marked by the arrival in Cambridge of the wave of student unrest that had swept round the world in the 1960s. It was typical of Ashby that he had a coherent philosophy of the university as an institution, and his actions were inspired by this instead of being solely a pragmatic response to events. He set up a joint committee of senior and junior members whose regular meetings were supplemented by his willingness to meet informally with all comers to his lodge&#151;student radicals and moderates, concerned and outraged staff. Ashby's stamina, coupled with his guile and patience, avoided serious unrest and set the university on a path to new codes of practice and more carefully structured staff&#150;student relationships. His experience at this time led to three lectures published in 1970, entitled <span class="italic">Masters and Scholars</span>, and two books covering a wider canvas, <span class="italic">The Rise of the Student Estate</span> (written jointly with Mary Anderson, 1970) and <span class="italic">Any Person, Any Study</span> (1971).<br>
<br>Ashby was meticulous in his attention to college and university affairs, but managed to combine these with numerous engagements elsewhere. It helped that he was a very early riser and for an hour or two before breakfast would work in his study dictating or writing. Other activities included membership of the University Grants Committee, 1959&#150;67, when the university system in the United Kingdom was undergoing rapid change and growth; the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in 1960&#150;69; and the presidency of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1963.<br>
<br>In 1954, when still vice-chancellor in Belfast, Ashby had joined a group commissioned by the Inter-University Council to report on higher education in east Africa. Between 1954 and 1966 he spent ten periods in Africa and visited more than a dozen countries, serving on commissions, visiting groups, and governing bodies, and acting as consultant and lecturer. He was critical of the approach of the council during the 1950s, which he thought lacked understanding of the higher education needs of Africa, but he was able to develop his own ideas during 1959&#150;61 when he became chairman of a commission sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation to advise on the development of universities in Nigeria. This led to a report, <span class="italic">Investment in Education</span> (1960), which was accepted by the new Nigerian government and led to the founding of four new universities and a permanent Nigerian universities commission. His experiences there led to two scholarly books, <span class="italic">African Universities and Western Tradition</span> (1964) and (with Mary Anderson) <span class="italic">Universities: British, Indian, African</span> (1966).<br>
<br>Two of the major public concerns that developed during the 1960s were environmental pollution and the possible risks from the use of genetic engineering in agriculture. In 1971&#150;3 Ashby was the first chairman of the standing royal commission on environmental pollution, which led to new standards for the control of toxic waste disposal in estuaries. He also oversaw a submission to the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Environment that helped establish the principle that the &#145;polluter pays&#146;. In 1973 he was made a life peer (having been knighted in 1956), and in the same year he became president and chancellor of the Queen's University of Belfast. In 1974 he chaired a working party jointly set up by the agricultural and medical research councils to examine the possible hazards for the environment from genetically engineered organisms. Their main proposals led to legislation that allowed the continuation of research while providing a new regulatory regime to enhance environmental protection. Ashby examined the historical background of British research and higher education in his study of R. B. Haldane, <span class="italic">Portrait of Haldane at Work on Education</span>, written with Mary Anderson (1974).<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>On his retirement in 1975 Ashby continued his work on environmental matters, which included membership of a House of Lords select committee scrutinizing proposals from the Commission of the European Community. His collaboration with Mary Anderson turned to environmental history, and further publications included <span class="italic">The Politics of Clean Air</span> (1981). He lectured widely in America and in 1976 and 1977 was visiting professor in the University of Michigan, giving a series of seminars, &#145;Politics for the environment&#146;. He helped Obert Tanner of Salt Lake City set up the Tanner lectures on human values in a number of leading universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, and in 1978 Ashby himself gave the first of these lectures in Utah, entitled &#145;The search for an environmental ethic&#146;. In 1975 he and his wife had moved to a small house in Newnham, Cambridge, and&#151;no longer having a secretary&#151;he learned to type for his own writings and for his extensive correspondence. In later years he took over the weekly shopping, going by car each Saturday morning to the supermarket when it opened at 8 a.m., and he and Helen went weekly to lunch in Clare Hall, where he was an honorary fellow and their son Michael was a professorial fellow. He died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, of heart failure, on 22 October 1992, and was survived by his wife and two sons. A memorial service was held at Great St Mary's, Cambridge, on 6 February 1993.<br>
