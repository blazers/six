<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span></span>  (1848&#150;1920), <span class="occ">pitman and poet</span>, was born on 15 August 1848 in Wood Street, Shotley Bridge, co. Durham, the son of Timothy Armstrong, labourer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. Childhood rickets bowed his legs to such an extent that when at the age of nine he started work as a trapper boy in the pit his brother had to carry him there; he never exceeded 5 feet in height. He fathered fourteen children, became a champion quoits player, and was a prodigious beer drinker. As an entertainer he interlarded his readings and recitations with spontaneous witticisms and, though no singer himself, he excelled in composing topical words to well-known tunes. He earned the title of &#145;pitman's poet&#146; by ardently espousing his fellow miners' cause when they suffered pit disaster or battled through strike or lock-out.<br>
<br>Indignant, sombre, or sardonic though Armstrong could be, he also wrote playfully. &#145;The Row between the Cages&#146;, which describes a quarrel between old and new lifts, is a piece of &#145;holy daftness&#146;&#151;Armstrong's own term for the true poet's stance  (Lloyd, 382).<br>
<br>Armstrong chronicled with humour and sympathy events in his local community such as a new railway, a flood, a brawl, an outing, or a drinking bout. In his songs, printed on single sheets and sold at 1<i>d</i>. a time, he used both standard English and a sort of phonetic rendering of the vernacular which can be irksome to read, yet convincing when sung. One item in this vein is the wryly funny &#145;Dorham Jail&#146;, written as a result of Armstrong's six-month sentence for stealing a pair of stockings from the co-operative shop at West Stanley, awarded despite his plea that &#145;he was drunk at the time and the stockings seemed from the way they were displayed the only pair of bowlegged ones he had come across&#146;  (Graham, 3).<br>
<br>Armstrong continued writing at least until 1916, when he published a jingoistic song about the Kaiser. After his death all of his compositions which could be found were gathered by one of his sons and published in a slim volume, baldly entitled <span class="italic">Song Book Containing 25 Songs of the Late Thomas Armstrong</span> (1930). Some items, such as &#145;Stanla Markit&#146; and &#145;Nanny's a Maisor&#146;, have continued to circulate in the north-east of England to the present day. Others&#151;&#145;Trimdon Grange Explosion&#146; and &#145;Durham Strike&#146;, for example&#151;fell into disuse but were given fresh currency (sometimes to new tunes) by the national folk revival which started in the 1950s. Several were later available on cassette or record.<br>
<br>Armstrong died at 4 Havelock Terrace, Tantobie, co. Durham, on 30 August 1920, and was buried in Tanfield cemetery. A new headstone unveiled there in 1986 by Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, bore a reproduction of part of the only known photograph of the cloth-capped, sharp-featured, smiling &#145;pitman's poet&#146;.<br>
