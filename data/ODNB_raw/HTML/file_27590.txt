<span class="headword">Towers,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough</span>, was born in Norfolk; his parents are unknown. In 1595 he went up to King's College, Cambridge, but migrated to Queens' College, graduating BA in 1602, proceeding MA in 1606, and being elected a fellow in 1608. In 1615 he proceeded BD and by 1616 the courtier William Compton, later first earl of Northampton, had employed him as his domestic chaplain, a position which continued under Spencer Compton, the second earl, after 1630. Before 1617 Towers married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1672); they had nine children, one of whom was called Spencer and another, Compton. On 26 March 1617 Compton appointed Towers rector of Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire, whereupon he resigned his fellowship. Here he first encountered King James I, who promoted him to royal chaplain in appreciation of a sermon on the sanctity of the material church. Towers joined a clique of avant-garde conformists led by John Lambe which dominated the Peterborough church courts. Through David Owen's influence, Northampton presented Towers to the rectory of Yardley Hastings on 12 August 1623. Having proceeded to DD by royal edict dated 13 December 1624, Towers acquired the living of Halifax, Yorkshire, on 4 July 1628. He next obtained from the crown the deanery of Peterborough, to which he was instituted by John Pocklington on 14 November 1630.<br>
<br>The vacancy of the see in 1634 encouraged Towers to lobby for the position, suggesting that another conformist friend, Robert Sibthorpe, replace him as dean. The strategy failed, but Towers achieved a prebendal stall at Westminster on 3 April 1634. He was known at the new court of Charles I and contributed to a series of Lenten lectures there. As Peterborough's dean he strictly regulated the cathedral clergy and charged &pound;5 for burial before the altar. A zealous supporter of the royal prerogative, he requested in 1637 that he, and not the bailiff, be put in charge of the collection of ship money in the town. He succeeded his friend, Francis Dee, as bishop in 1639, being consecrated on 13 January after resigning his prebend.<br>
<br>Towers ranks among the most combative of Laudian bishops. An aggressive consecration sermon preached by Peter Heylin was echoed by the bishop when he launched a tirade against the &#145;puritan faction&#146; at his visitation of 1639  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/474/80). His piety emphasized compulsory participation in altar-centred worship while downplaying the word-centred piety most characteristic of the Jacobean episcopate. His visitation articles, which were borrowed from Matthew Wren's notorious set for Norwich in 1636, stipulated the full Laudian ceremonial&#151;the priest administering communion from within the rails of an east-end altar to communicants receiving there kneeling. Dee had enforced this during his episcopate, but had never openly published the requirement, and the result of Towers's doing so was open opposition by the local magistracy. Towers also recommended the pre-Reformation practice of confession and enjoined all parishes to purchase silver communion services. William Prynne singled out Towers as a threat to the favourite Jacobean ordinance of preaching and, indeed, Towers's policy was one of severe regulation. He intervened in a local dispute between Sibthorpe and opponents at Brackley by erecting a new combination lecture but one whose continued existence he linked, uniquely, to performance of the liturgy in the Laudian fashion. He was a vigorous enforcer of the regime's position during the bishops' wars; prosecutions were initiated against one minister accused of holding a fast in support of the invading Scots and against a ministerial conference which met at Kettering to support the Scots and condemn the oath legitimizing the new canons.<br>
<br>The Long Parliament impeached Towers on 4 August 1641 (with twelve other bishops) for approving in convocation the clerical benevolence to fund the bishops' wars and the canons of 1640, which were regarded as illegal. He was also a signatory of the protest signed by twelve bishops in December complaining that it was not safe for them to attend parliament and that, in their absence, all votes taken were void. The protesters were impeached for high treason for this attempted veto, and were committed to the Tower, but in April 1642 Towers, having been released, returned to Peterborough and soon after joined the king's headquarters at Oxford where he remained during the civil war until the city's surrender in 1646. By that time he had been ejected by parliament from his livings and was reported in 1647 for harassing one replacement minister. Returning to Peterborough he died in obscurity on 10 January 1649 and was buried the next day in the cathedral.<br>
<br>The bishop's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_27590"></a><span class="headword">William Towers</span>  (1617?&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was educated at Westminster School as a king's scholar. Having matriculated on 1 September 1634 from Christ Church, Oxford, he graduated BA on 11 April 1638 and proceeded MA on 22 May 1641. His father ordained him a priest on 19 April 1641 and instituted him to a prebendal stall the next day. In 1644 he was appointed rector of Barnack, Northamptonshire, but the course taken by the war led him to move to Oxford, where he obtained a BD in 1646. Ejected from his preferments by parliament in 1646, he supported himself by serving as curate to Edward Reynolds at Upton near Northampton, and obtained additional patronage from Sir Justinian Isham of Lamport. He published three works in the 1650s&#151;<span class="italic">Atheismus Vapulans, or, A Treatise Against Atheism</span> (1654), <span class="italic">Polytheismus Vapulans</span> (1654?), and <span class="italic">A sermon against murder: by occasion of the Romanists putting the protestants to death in the dukedom of Savoy</span> (1655).<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Towers published two sermons of thanksgiving, the first preached on 29 May, the day of Charles II's entry to London, and the second, <span class="italic">Obedience Perpetually due to Kings</span> (1660), a month later. Towers himself was restored to his preferments through the friendship of the former royalist Mountjoy Blount, earl of Newport, while maintaining the family connection with the Comptons by dedicating his edition of his father's <span class="italic">Four Sermons</span> (1660) to James, the third earl of Northampton. In 1662 he was appointed rector of Fiskerton, Lincolnshire, and the following year published a sermon preached at the bishop of Lincoln's visitation. He died on 20 October 1666 while visiting nearby Uffington, where he was buried.<br>
