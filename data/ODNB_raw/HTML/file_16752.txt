<span class="headword">Lipscomb,  George</span>  (1773&#150;1846), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 4 January 1773 at Quainton, Buckinghamshire, the son of James Lipscomb (1730&#150;1794), a former naval surgeon from Hampshire, and his wife, Mary (1745&#150;1828), daughter of Jonathan George, farmer, of Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire. After attending schools at Quainton and Aylesbury and receiving some medical instruction from his father, he studied surgery in London under Sir James Earle. In 1792 he was appointed house surgeon of St Bartholomew's Hospital and became a member of the Lyceum Medicum Londinense. He obtained the degree of MD from Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1806.<br>
<br>In 1794 Lipscomb became lieutenant of the North Hampshire militia and in 1798 captain commandant of the Warwickshire volunteer infantry, for whom he wrote an <span class="italic">Address to the Volunteers on their Duty to their King and Country</span>. Also in 1798 he was chosen deputy recorder of Warwick. At this period Lipscomb was practising as a surgeon in Warwick and he drew on his experience there in <span class="italic">An Essay on the Nature and Treatment of a Putrid Malignant Fever which Prevailed at Warwick</span> (1799). Later he moved to Birmingham, where he practised as a chemist and surgeon, and then to Coleshill, Warwickshire. He was declared bankrupt in 1805, but reached agreement with his creditors. In the same year he left Warwickshire for London and afterwards moved to Whitchurch, Buckinghamshire, where he was practising medicine by 1819. After leaving Whitchurch in 1832, he spent the rest of his life at various addresses in London.<br>
<br>As an author, Lipscomb displayed a wide range of interests. In addition to medical writings on subjects including asthma, hydrophobia, and vaccination, of which he was a staunch opponent, he published five topographical works between 1799 and 1823, one of which, <span class="italic">A Journey into South Wales</span> (1802), contains a section on Buckinghamshire. He wrote three novels published between 1809 and 1812, two of them anonymously and one under the pseudonym John English. He contributed numerous articles to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, usually signed Viator, and various essays on subjects connected with political economy, statistics, and general literature to the <span class="italic">Literary Panorama</span> and other periodicals. He suggested in an essay the plan of the Society for the Encouragement of Agricultural Industry. In 1832 Lipscomb delivered in London a series of lectures on cholera, which he afterwards published in the form of a treatise, accompanied by his correspondence on the subject with Lord Melbourne. Lipscomb also published sermons, edited the <span class="italic">Clerical Guide</span> for 1821, and composed hymns and anthems for charity schools.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1803 at St Martin's, Birmingham, Lipscomb married Elizabeth (1760&#150;1834), the widow of Richard Hopkins of Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, and third daughter of Thomas Wells, also of Stratford. They had no children. On his wife's death in 1834 her whole fortune, on which he chiefly depended, passed to her own family.<br>
<br>Lipscomb's great work, <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckingham</span>, was based chiefly on his own collections, which he spent over twenty-five years in acquiring, and on those which he received on the death of the Revd Edward Cooke (1772&#150;1824), rector of Haversham, Buckinghamshire, of whose will he was executor. The first part of the <span class="italic">History</span> was published in 1831 by John Bowyer Nichols, but despite extensive subscriptions it created such financial difficulties for Lipscomb that publication of the succeeding parts had to be suspended. He expected to acquire considerable property from Cooke's estate, but the inheritance was contested and after many years in chancery the case was decided against him in 1831.<br>
<br>The remainder of the work was published between 1838 and 1847 by J. and W. Robins, and before Lipscomb died he had the satisfaction of knowing that the eighth and final part was in the press. The complete <span class="italic">History</span> filled four quarto volumes with title-pages dated 1847. The book, considering the difficulties of its publication, is very creditable, although Lipscomb lacked the means to make full use of his materials. <span class="italic">The Victoria History of the County of Buckingham</span> (1905), in its preface, described Lipscomb's <span class="italic">History</span> as &#145;the only serious attempt to compile a complete history of the county&#146; and gave the opinion that &#145;Perhaps not quite equal to our best county histories, it is yet a work of great value&#146;  (1.xxiii). Lipscomb died at home at 1 Merrow Street, Walworth, London, on 9 November 1846 and, as his wife had been, was buried in the graveyard of St George the Martyr, Southwark.<br>
