<span class="headword">Scottish colourists</span>  (<em>act. </em>1900&#150;1935), <span class="occ">painters</span>, were a loose association of four painters, from Edinburgh and the west of Scotland, whose work during the first three decades of the twentieth century revitalized painting in Scotland through their awareness of new developments in painting in France before 1914. Their response to the innovative use of colour and painterly handling in paintings by Henri Matisse and his followers provided a conduit for such new work to reach Britain and, particularly, Scotland in the first half of the twentieth century. It was not a movement that produced leaders and followers, and although all four artists knew each other they rarely worked together in more than pairs, and never as a group of four.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_38929"></a><span class="headword">John Duncan Fergusson</span>  (1874&#150;1961)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Leith, Edinburgh, on 9 March 1874, the son of John Ferguson and his wife, Christina Fergusson. He always maintained that he enrolled at Edinburgh University to study medicine, although there is no record of his enrolment there, and then transferred to art classes at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh <i>c</i>.1893. The curriculum there did not suit him and he left, whereafter he was largely self-taught with occasional terms at various academies and ateliers in Paris. The work of the Glasgow Boys and James McNeill Whistler were major influences on his early paintings (see <span class="italic">Dieppe, 14 July 1905: Night</span>; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh), as was the work of French artists seen on his regular visits to Paris and northern France between 1895 and 1906. After a successful exhibition in London, Fergusson decided to settle in Paris, where he lived until 1913, when he moved to the Mediterranean coast. In Paris he became part of the artistic caf&eacute; society of Montparnasse, meeting Picasso and other leading artists, becoming a soci&eacute;taire of the Salon d'Automne, and absorbing much of the excitement and advances in painting that characterized Paris before 1914. Paintings such as <span class="italic">Rhythm</span> (1911; University of Stirling) and <span class="italic">Les Eus</span> (1911&#150;13; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow) show his assimilation of French avant-garde artistic and philosophical alliances.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war forced Fergusson's return to Edinburgh, where Peploe also was living, but by 1918 he was living in London, with the dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49248/', "Margaret Morris (1891&#150;1980)")</script>. He soon became an integral part of the Chelsea art world and also of the summer schools that Morris arranged for her growing number of pupils in the Margaret Morris Movement. He returned to France with Morris and her dance classes until forced, again by the outbreak of war, to return to Scotland, to Glasgow, in 1939. There, with Morris, he established an alternative artistic environment in the city, separate from the established worlds of the Glasgow School of Art and the Glasgow Art Club. He remained in the city until his death, at his home, 4 Clouston Street, on 30 January 1961.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_38930"></a><span class="headword">Samuel John Peploe</span>  (1871&#150;1935)<span class="occ"></span> was born at 39 Manor Place, Edinburgh, on 27 January 1871, the son of Robert Luff Peploe, secretary of the Commercial Bank, Edinburgh, and his second wife, Anne Watson. After the death of his father in 1884 Peploe was encouraged by his guardians to follow a career in the army; his refusal led him to enter a law firm, but in 1893 he persuaded the guardians to allow him to enrol in the Trustees' Academy, in Edinburgh. Like Fergusson he was unhappy with the teaching and left for Paris, where he attended classes at various academies and ateliers. He was quick to absorb the influence of Manet, and on his return to Edinburgh <i>c</i>.1897 he embarked on a successful career as a landscape, figure, and still life painter. He then met Fergusson, and the two painters formed an immediate rapport based as much on personal liking as on their mutual admiration for Whistler, the Glasgow Boys, and post-impressionist French painting. They were the first of the Scottish colourists to work together, and broadly formulated the principles on which all four artists would concentrate until the mid-1930s. In 1910, using the proceeds from a successful exhibition in 1909, and following his marriage in that year to Margaret MacKay (1874&#150;1958), Peploe joined Fergusson in Paris, where his artistic education was completed and his mature style emerged. Together they began to explore Brittany and the west coast of France before Fergusson determined to follow in the footsteps of van Gogh and Gauguin by moving to Antibes.<br>
<br>Peploe's innate conservatism and his devotion to his growing family prevented him from settling in the south of France with Fergusson, and he again returned to Edinburgh. Although his new paintings, such as <span class="italic">Still Life</span> (<i>c</i>.1913; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art), did not meet with the approval of his dealer Peploe gradually achieved success and remained in Edinburgh for the rest of his life, with brief excursions to the south of France (see <span class="italic">Landscape at Cassis</span>, 1924; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art) and annual holidays in the Western Isles, principally Iona. In 1927 he was made a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy and in 1933 he began to teach part-time at Edinburgh College of Art. He died in Edinburgh, at 35 Drumsheugh Gardens, on 11 October 1935.<br>
<br>Peploe was introduced to Iona by <a name="cosubject_38961"></a><span class="headword">Francis Campbell Boileau Cadell</span>  (1883&#150;1937)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Edinburgh on 12 April 1883, the first child of Francis Cadell, a surgeon, and Mary Hamilton Boileau. His request to attend art school was supported by his liberal parents, encouraged by a family friend, Arthur Melville. He enrolled at the Royal Scottish Academy life school but, like Peploe and Fergusson at the Trustees' Academy, was disillusioned by the teaching. With his mother he moved to Paris in 1899, to enrol in the Acad&eacute;mie Julian, and returned to Edinburgh in 1903; in 1906 his family moved to Munich, to return to Edinburgh in 1908. In his early life, therefore, he was well-travelled, and through family connections he met many of the future patrons who were to sustain him through the commercial vicissitudes of his career. One such figure was Sir Patrick Ford, who financed a visit to Venice in 1910, following Cadell's unsuccessful first solo show in Edinburgh in 1909. In Venice, Cadell began to paint in a manner similar to Peploe, whose work he had seen in Edinburgh, and he returned to Scotland with a group of paintings showing a clear grasp of impressionism and the effects of light on colour. He soon established a niche in Edinburgh, painting portraits, figure subjects, and still lifes that reflected the douce, middle-class milieu of the New Town. His studios at 130 George Street (1909&#150;20) and 6 Ainslie Place (1920&#150;32) were usually as much the subject of his paintings as the sitters themselves (see <span class="italic">The Black Hat</span>, 1914; Edinburgh City Art Centre, and <span class="italic">The Orange Blind</span>; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries).<br>
<br>In 1915 Cadell enlisted as a private soldier in the Royal Scots, 9th battalion, resisting a commission until 1918, when he was transferred to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 8th battalion, as a second lieutenant. Peace brought with it an uncertain future for him; changing social mores, his own extravagant lifestyle and personal life, and an unpredictable commercial demand for paintings brought an inexorable decline in his wealth, health, and output. He survived the 1920s with the support of consistent patrons such as W. G. Service and Ion Harrison, and with the friendship and encouragement of Peploe, with whom he holidayed frequently on Iona and occasionally in the south of France. Cadell had discovered Iona <i>c</i>.1913 and it was to become an important subject for him. In 1935 he was elected a full member of the Royal Scottish Academy but he was by then in considerable financial and physical distress. He died, of cancer, in Edinburgh on 6 December 1937. He never married.<br>
<br>The fourth member of the group, <a name="cosubject_38962"></a><span class="headword">(George) Leslie Hunter</span>  (1877&#150;1931)<span class="occ"></span>, was not associated with Edinburgh. He was born on 7 August 1877 in Rothesay, on the island of Bute, the son of William Hunter, a pharmacist, and his wife, Jeannie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart. In 1892, after the deaths of two of his sons from tuberculosis, William Hunter took his family to California, where he bought an orange grove. In 1899 he and his wife returned to Scotland, but Leslie and an elder brother decided to stay in California, moving north from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Hunter enjoyed the cosmopolitan freedom of the city and taught himself to draw and paint, earning a living as a book and newspaper illustrator. He seems to have returned to Scotland some time between 1903 and 1905 and also visited Paris with a group of American artists. It is not known whether at this time he encountered the work of Fergusson and Peploe, which was regularly on show in dealers' galleries and public exhibitions in Scotland, or whether he saw any of the great exhibitions of the work of the post-impressionists. Hunter returned to San Francisco via New York in 1905. His association with authors such as Bret Harte and Jack London, for both of whom he illustrated novels, probably helped him to secure an exhibition in a San Francisco gallery. Unfortunately both the gallery and all Hunter's work in it were destroyed by the great earthquake of 1906.<br>
<br>Hunter returned to Scotland to live with his mother in Glasgow, earning a living again from newspaper illustration. He moved to London and then to Paris, and began to paint more seriously, studying the work of Dutch and French still life painters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He returned to Scotland after the outbreak of war, and worked as a labourer on an uncle's farm in Lanarkshire. He continued to paint, and exhibited with Alexander Reid in Glasgow in 1916, as a result of which he acquired a nucleus of collectors who helped to sustain his erratic way of life over the next decade or so. He had further success with Reid after the war, and with the proceeds of these sales visited Paris, Florence, and Venice in 1922 and 1923. A friend, John Ressich, introduced him to Fergusson, through whom he met Peploe, and with Reid's involvement he exhibited with the other three painters in London and Paris in the mid-1920s.<br>
<br>Hunter began to suffer from both mental and physical illness, and his unpredictable behaviour isolated him from fellow painters and from all but the most dedicated patrons. In 1926 he set out for the south of France, where he encountered both Fergusson and Peploe, but his paintings found no market in Scotland and Reid was forced to terminate the stipend that he had been paying him. Undeterred, Hunter arranged an exhibition in New York, which had some success, perhaps more in the renewal of old friendships than financially, and in 1929 he returned to France, where he settled in St Paul de Vence. Illness forced his return to Scotland, where he began to paint on the shores of Loch Lomond, followed by some months in London, where a new patron, the impresario C. B. Cochran, commissioned him to make sketches of one of his productions. He returned to Glasgow, where he again fell ill, and was admitted to hospital for emergency surgery. There it was found that he was beyond cure, and he died at 3 Claremont Terrace on 6 December 1931. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>The consistent link between the Scottish colourists is a love of paint and its particular qualities, and an understanding of the power of colour and design in painting. From an early interest in <i>plein-air</i> painting through to the immediacy of fauvist painting the colourists never lost sight of the painterly qualities that they inherited from their study of the Glasgow Boys. Scottish painters from the middle of the eighteenth century had expressed their fascination with fluid handling, bold compositions, and clear colour&#151;qualities that the four colourists reinforced through their association with French painting.<br>
<br>The Scottish colourists brought to British painting an awareness, gained principally at first hand, of the developments made in Paris by Picasso and, particularly, Matisse and the Fauves in the first decade of the century. Roger Fry's post-impressionist exhibitions had sent English painting in search of &#145;significant form&#146;, and Fry had not included the work of the Scots in his shows. The four Scottish colourists responded more to the vitality, both painterly and emotional, of the gestural handling and brilliant colour of Gauguin, van Gogh, and Matisse. Despite their successes in showing in London in the 1920s they did little to divert avant-garde English painters from the impact of surrealism, constructivism, and the work of German refugees such as Naum Gabo, Antoine Pevsner, and Kurt Schwitters. Their success and influence lay with English painters such as Matthew Smith and David Bomberg, who shared their knowledge of, and interest in, French pre-war painting, and with a younger generation of artists in Scotland who, throughout the 1940s and 1950s, saw in the work of the colourists a direct link with Picasso and Matisse and all that had come to be seen as pivotal in the development of painting in the twentieth century. The work of the colourists epitomized that aspect of the Scottish character in which a sense of responsibility, caution, and respect for convention is balanced by an element of irresponsibility, rebelliousness, and even aggression. The colourists harnessed this underlying aspect of their nature, and through it involved British painting in the mainstream of European art of the twentieth century.<br>
