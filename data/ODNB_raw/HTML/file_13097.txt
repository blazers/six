<span class="headword">Herring,  Julines</span>  (1582&#150;1644), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Reformed minister in the Netherlands</span>, was born at Llanbrynmair, Montgomeryshire, and received his first education from his mother's kinsman, a Mr Perkin, minister at More chapel in Shropshire. Herring later joined his parents in Coventry, where his father served as sheriff and mayor, and he attended the school there. As a schoolboy he was unusually pious; he not only read the scriptures diligently but also engaged with two or three friends in religious exercises before going to play. In 1600 he was admitted as a scholar to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1604. He subsequently returned to Coventry and was encouraged to study divinity by the renowned nonconformist minister Humphrey Fenn. Herring, along with his friend John Ball of Whitmore in Staffordshire, deliberately chose to be ordained by an Irish bishop in order to avoid subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>.<br>
<br>With the influence of Arthur Hildersham, the prominent nonconformist vicar of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, Herring was employed from about 1610 at the parish of Calke, Derbyshire, which was a peculiar jurisdiction exempt from the bishop's authority. Herring was a popular preacher, attracting auditors from twenty towns and villages in the area, and on Sundays so many people attended his sermons that they had to listen at the windows outside the chapel. Fortunately they could hear what he said, because Herring's voice was &#145;clear and strong&#146;. At Calke Herring also influenced the young Simeon Ashe, who later became a prominent pro-parliamentarian minister during the civil war. Herring remained at Calke for eight years, but was eventually forced out, according to Clarke, by &#145;prelatical power&#146; and by &#145;ill-affected men&#146;  (Clarke, 463). While he was at Calke Herring married Christian Gellibrand, daughter of a former preacher to the English company at Flushing; they had thirteen children. Through his wife's relatives Herring was connected with a network of godly preachers: one of her sisters was married to Robert Nicolls, minister at Wrenbury, Cheshire, another sister married Oliver Bowles of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and a third married a Mr Barry of Cottesmore, Rutland.<br>
<br>In 1618 Herring was invited by the corporation of Shrewsbury to be the lecturer at St Alkmund's, where he preached every Tuesday and every Sunday. Under his influence Shrewsbury gained a reputation as the centre of a puritan network which stretched from Cheshire through Shropshire and into Herefordshire. Herring repeated his Sunday sermon in the evening in rotation at the houses of the leading godly members of the corporation, Edward Jones, George Wright, and William Rowley. He also attracted puritan preachers from further afield to preach in the town, including Thomas Pierson of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire, and his brother-in-law Nicolls. Herring was also welcomed to the house at Sheriffhales, Shropshire, of Lady Margaret Bromley, who entertained at religious exercises eminent puritan ministers from neighbouring counties, including Pierson, Ball, and Nicolls.<br>
<br>Herring spent seventeen years at Shrewsbury, but during that time the conformists in the town, led by Peter Studley, vicar of St Chad's, mounted a campaign to remove him and complained on numerous occasions about his nonconformity. In 1620, for example, he was presented to the church authorities for failing to read the prayer book and not administering or receiving the sacrament. As a result Herring was suspended from preaching several times and when in the 1630s his actions were drawn to the attention of Archbishop William Laud, the archbishop declared &#145;I will pickle up that Herring of Shrewsbury&#146;  (Clarke, 466). During his suspensions Herring took refuge in conducting private fasts and regularly expounded the scriptures three times a day to his family and neighbours. He also made a practice of attending church services on Sundays, in order to demonstrate his opposition to separation, and he was an early opponent of the Shropshire separatists Daniel and Katherine Chidley. In 1637 Herring was one of thirteen clerical signatories (who also included John Dod, Simeon Ashe, and John Ball) to a letter addressed to ministers in New England, which expressed the fear that they were adopting separatist practices. Eventually Herring gave up hope of being reinstated in Shrewsbury and he moved to Wrenbury in Cheshire where he lived with his widowed sister-in-law Mistress Nicolls. At Wrenbury he lived privately and comforted individuals with afflicted consciences.<br>
<br>In 1636 Herring was invited to succeed the ageing John Paget as minister of the English Reformed church in Amsterdam. After much &#145;seeking of God&#146; and consultation with &#145;godly brethren&#146;, Herring accepted this post, although it meant leaving many friends and relatives in England, whom he feared he would never see again  (Clarke, 468). He was also forced to take ship from Great Yarmouth to Rotterdam in secret in order to avoid a ban on travel without a licence. On 24 August 1637, before his departure, he drew up a will leaving bequests to his wife, his sons John, Jonathan, Samuel, and James, and his daughters Christian, Dorcas, Mary, and Joanna. He burnt many of his manuscripts and correspondence with other puritan ministers to avoid their seizure <i>en route</i> by the authorities. He arrived in Rotterdam on 20 September and his first sermon was so satisfactory that the English congregation accepted him immediately. At Amsterdam Herring was able to officiate within a functioning presbyterian system and he used his position to comment on the religious and political situation in England. He declared that he was not an enemy to the bishops personally, but only to their &#145;Pride and Prelatical rule&#146;. He favoured a presbyterian church government, which he described as &#145;the Government of Jesus Christ&#146; and drew attention to the errors of the English Independents. He prayed that the Scots might be an instrument of good in England and on hearing of the battle of Edgehill in 1642 he prayed to God to &#145;preserve thine own People, and maintain thine own cause&#146;  (ibid., 471). After a lingering illness Herring died on 28 March 1644 in Amsterdam. His will was proved by his widow on 26 March 1646. His lifelong refusal to yield to the authority of the English bishops made Herring a significant figure to the presbyterians in England during the civil war period.<br>
