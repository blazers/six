<span class="headword">Owen of Wales</span> <span class="st"> [Owain ap Thomas ap Rhodri]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1378), <span class="occ">mercenary</span>, was the last direct heir of the dynasty of Gwynedd. He was a prominent figure in the Hundred Years' War and became a symbol of continued Welsh resistance to English rule.<h2>
<a name="Originsandearlycareer"></a>Origins and early career</h2>Owen was the son of Thomas ap Rhodri ap Gruffudd 
    (Sir Thomas Retherik; <i>d</i>. 1363)
   and his wife, Cecilia. Thomas's father Rhodri was the youngest son of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (<i>d</i>. 1244) and therefore the brother of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, prince of Wales. In 1272 Rhodri had quitclaimed all his hereditary right to lands in north Wales and elsewhere to Llywelyn for 1000 marks, but the money was never paid in full. Rhodri served in Edward I's army in the Welsh wars of 1276&#150;7 and 1282 and acquired lands in Cheshire, Gloucestershire, and Surrey; he was dead by 1315. When Thomas died in 1363 Owen was out of the country; he returned two years later to claim his inheritance, but he appears to have gone abroad again in 1366 and after the renewal of Anglo-French hostilities in 1369 he went over to the French side and all his lands were declared forfeit.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Owen's career before 1365, nor is it known why he joined the French. It is likely that he became aware of his descent and his claims at a time of increasing tension and restlessness in Wales; it may be significant that both he and his father used the arms of the princes of Gwynedd on their seals. According to Froissart he had in his youth been in the service of the French crown, had fought on the French side at Poitiers in 1356, and after the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny in 1360 had served in Lombardy, but there is no evidence to confirm this. Froissart also describes him as the son of a prince of Wales put to death by Edward III, which indicates that the French were aware that he had some kind of dynastic claim. By 1369 Charles V of France was certainly ready to support his bid to recover his patrimony as a means of carrying the war to British soil. A fleet sailed from Harfleur under Owen's command just before Christmas, only to be driven back by winter storms in the English Channel; the authorities in Wales had been alerted and defensive preparations ordered.<h2>
<a name="WelshaspirationsandFrenchsupport"></a>Welsh aspirations and French support</h2>In 1370 Owen was serving under Bertrand du Guesclin during Sir Robert Knolles's <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> in Maine and Anjou and was briefly in charge of the castle of Saumur on the Loire; the following summer he and his company were employed by the town of Metz in Lorraine and at the end of 1371 he was in northern Burgundy. But Charles V was still interested in a landing in Wales and on 10 May 1372 Owen issued a proclamation in which he declared his claim to the country &#145;which &hellip; is and should be mine by right&#146;  (Paris, Archives Nationales, JJ<sup>c</sup>27, fol. 55), and in which he acknowledged the support he had had from the French in men, ships, and money. The second invasion fleet, probably with between 600 and 800 men, sailed from Harfleur at the beginning of June. On the way it attacked Guernsey where the garrison, apparently warned that Owen was on the way, had been reinforced. The raid, remembered in island tradition as &#145;la descente des Aragousais&#146;, was commemorated in a ballad; most of the content is entirely unhistorical but it and Froissart agree that the attack was a failure and it is difficult to understand why, when the expedition had a clear objective, the attack on Guernsey should have been undertaken at all. In fact Owen never reached Wales; while in Guernsey he appears to have been ordered to abandon the venture and to proceed to Castile to seek ships to blockade La Rochelle. The order may have been precipitated by the news that a large English fleet under the command of John Hastings, earl of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1375), had sailed from Southampton with money and reinforcements for the army in Guyenne. By the time Owen reached Santander the fleet had been destroyed by the Castilians off La Rochelle and it was then, according to Froissart, that Pembroke, brought ashore in chains, was challenged by him. He now sought Castilian assistance for a further expedition to Wales, but none was forthcoming.<h2>
<a name="CampaignsinFranceandaSwissfiasco"></a>Campaigns in France and a Swiss fiasco</h2>Owen now set out for La Rochelle with a combined Franco-Castilian fleet. In late August he defeated the Anglo-Gascon force which had just raised the French siege of Soubise at the mouth of the Charente, taking prisoner one of the leading Gascon captains, the Captal de Buch (<i>d</i>. 1377), and the seneschal of Poitou, Sir Thomas Percy (<i>d</i>. 1403); Percy was captured by a Welsh chaplain from Owen's company, Hywel Flint. Soubise surrendered and this was followed on 8 September 1372 by the fall of La Rochelle.<br>
<br>Charles V was planning a further expedition to Wales in 1373, this time with Castilian assistance, but nothing came of it because of the projected invasion of Brittany by John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and his great <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> through France. For the greater part of the year Owen was serving in Poitou and Saintonge as town after town fell to the French; for a time he was captain of the castle of Broue in Saintonge and was also captain of Soubise, being retained with his company in the service of the king. He may subsequently have campaigned in northern France and according to one source he was involved in the siege of St Sauveur-le-Vicomte in the Cotentin, which fell on 3 July 1375.<br>
<br>Two days earlier a year's truce had been agreed at Bruges, but Owen and his company were not unemployed for long; on 14 October he was recruited by Enguerrand (VII) de Coucy (<i>d</i>. 1397) to join his invasion of Austria, which Coucy claimed through his mother; the contract, in which he agreed to provide 400 men, survives in the Swiss State Archives. The Austrian expedition was a complete fiasco; the army had to pass through Switzerland and it met fierce Swiss resistance. On 27 December 1375 Owen and his men were attacked by the men of Bern at Fraubrunnen to the north of the city and they suffered a crushing defeat; even Owen's contract with Coucy was left behind in the rout. The Bernese were so proud of their victory over a distinguished mercenary captain that a ballad, the &#145;Bear Song&#146;, was composed to commemorate it.<h2>
<a name="Assassination"></a>Assassination</h2>In 1376 Owen was back in the king of France's service and for the next two years he was fighting in the south-west of France. In 1378 the duke of Anjou ordered him to take a force of 500 men and besiege Mortagne on the Gironde estuary. During the siege a squire called John Lamb, who claimed to be a Welshman, appeared on the scene and Owen accepted him into his service. But Lamb was an English agent and one morning, when Owen had risen early and was surveying the castle, he killed him with a dagger. For this Lamb was subsequently paid the sum of &pound;20. Owen was buried in the church of St L&eacute;ger near Mortagne, but no trace remains of his tomb; the church was demolished in 1884. There is no record of his having married or had children, although the Guernsey ballad does refer to a wife called Eleanor whom he had supposedly married in Maine; this part of the ballad, however, bears little relation to historical fact.<h2>
<a name="WelshsupportforOwensclaimsandthereputationofOwainLawgoch"></a>Welsh support for Owen's claims and the reputation of Owain Lawgoch</h2>Owen of Wales was a great deal more than an exiled pretender pursuing a forlorn hope. After he joined the French he commanded a free company, most of the members of which were Welshmen who had defected to him from the English forces. When his men were mustered at Limoges on 8 August 1376 at least 85 of the 100 members of the company were Welsh, which shows that there were Welsh soldiers in France who knew who he was and what he represented. He also had supporters in Wales; in 1370 an Anglesey man was accused of being a supporter of Owain Lawgoch, &#145;traitor and enemy of the lord prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Record of Caernarvon</span>, 133), and in 1372 and 1374 Rhys ap Roppert, one of the leading men in Flintshire, a former sheriff of the county and a member of the leading lineage in north Wales, was accused of sending him money and receiving treasonable letters from him. Two of Rhys's sons were in French service, one of them probably being Owen's lieutenant Ieuan Wyn, known as the Poursuivant d'Amour, who inherited his company on his death. There are other references in the Flintshire judicial records to local men who were in France with Owen. Two poems to him also survive, one of them by one of the leading poets of the time, Gruffydd ap Maredudd ap Dafydd.<br>
<br>The second half of the fourteenth century in Wales was a time of restlessness and discontent when the leaders of the native community, who felt that they were no longer treated with due respect, were becoming increasingly disillusioned with the house of Plantagenet. In these circumstances the presence in France of the rightful heir of the house of Gwynedd who was also a distinguished soldier could not but be significant, although there is no evidence that Owen ever visited Wales or was even able to speak the language. The authorities were well aware of the attraction he exerted and a plan for a Franco-Castilian invasion of England in 1377, involving a renegade English knight, Sir John Minsterworth, may have led to the decision to have him eliminated.<br>
<br>Owen's supporters in Wales were able to draw on a long tradition of prophetic poetry which looked forward to the coming of a new leader who would drive out the English and restore the ancient glory of the Britons. Much of this poetry is obscure and allusive, but some of it undoubtedly refers to him. His charisma did not die with him; there grew up a body of stories about a great hero, Owain Lawgoch, asleep in a cave awaiting the call to rise and redeem his people, but it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that this Owain was identified conclusively as Owain ap Thomas ap Rhodri, although the Flintshire sources already mentioned do actually describe him by both names. The epithet attached to his name is not easily explained. The term <i>llawgoch</i> (&#145;red hand&#146;) was normally applied to a murderer, but it could also have referred to a birthmark or to a scar. Several fifteenth-century poets refer to him as Owain Frych (Owain the Freckled), which may suggest that his nickname derived from the fact that his hand was heavily freckled. The Guernsey ballad describes his right hand as having been severed by a blow from a halberd during the raid of 1372, but this is probably an onomastic reference; he was certainly known as Owain Lawgoch in 1370.<br>
<br>There can be no doubt that Owen of Wales was perceived as a serious threat to English rule in Wales. In life an eminent captain, he was to many in Wales the Mab Darogan or &#145;Son of Prophecy&#146;; after his death he joined the ranks of the &#145;sleeping heroes&#146;, those charismatic leaders whose death it was hard to accept. The charisma existed in France as well; in the seventeenth century the family of de Galle in Dauphin&eacute; claimed incorrectly to be descended from him. But Owen of Wales or Owain ap Thomas ap Rhodri was a significant figure in the context of Welsh political attitudes in the late fourteenth century and his activities and the support they elicited helped to pave the way for the revolt of Owain Glyn D&#373;r.<br>
