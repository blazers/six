<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1618?, <em>d.</em> 1683), <span class="occ">lawyer and legal writer</span>, was probably the Thomas, son of John Robinson, who was baptized in St Margaret's, Westminster, on 11 September 1618. He became a member of Staple Inn, and entered practice as an attorney of the common pleas in the early 1640s. By about 1648 he was sufficiently established to marry Jane (<i>d</i>. 1665), daughter of Lumley Dew, and in Hilary term 1657 he was able to purchase the immensely lucrative office of chief protonotary of the common pleas. This office usually changed hands for over &pound;5000, which was indeed the sum paid for the succession on Robinson's own death. According to custom, he was made an associate bencher of the Inner Temple, where the office was housed, and he soon became one of the inn's principal figures, in social as well as physical stature. After the great fire he contributed over &pound;8000 towards rebuilding 7 King's Bench Walk, which was completed in 1671 and known as Sir Thomas Robinson's Building until the nineteenth century. Six years later he was made a complete bencher, and from 1682 until his death he served as treasurer, taking a keen interest in the improvement of Temple Church and the controversial negotiations over the new organ. The screen in the old hall bore his initials until its demolition in 1867. Meanwhile, in 1676 or 1677, Robinson had purchased Kentwell Hall in Long Melford, Suffolk, an attractive Elizabethan house of red brick with twelve wainscot rooms, where he laid out an avenue of limes in 1678. In January 1682, presumably in return for a further considerable outlay, he was created baronet. In the early hours of 2 August 1683, while Sir Thomas was sleeping in the Temple, a fire spread to King's Bench Walk from the Whitefriars, whereupon<blockquote>he, to avoid the fury and violence of the Flames, adventured to leap out at his Chamber Window, and thereby (being a very corpulent Man) so bruised his body, that he soon expired. (Philipps, 136)</blockquote>When the fire abated, an iron chest was found in Robinson's rooms containing melted gold and silver plate thought to be worth nearly &pound;10,000. He was buried on 7 August in the south aisle of Temple Church, where a monumental inscription remained until 1941, when it was destroyed in an air raid; a coffin plate with his arms was discovered in the rubble.<br>
<br>In 1684 there was published under Robinson's name <span class="italic">A Book of Special Entries</span>, a collection of pleadings compiled by him in the course of his practice. The preface claimed that they had been selected from a &#145;Many-Volumed Atlas of Pleadings&#146; and destined for the press &#145;chiefly for the Benefit of the Clerks and Attorneys of his Office&#146;. Robinson also left an unpublished series of notebooks that were found in Kentwell Hall in 1960 and are now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. These contain brief reports or notes of common pleas cases from 1657 to 1678, in Robinson's autograph, with some memoranda on practice stretching back to 1641. The baronetcy became extinct in 1743.<br>
