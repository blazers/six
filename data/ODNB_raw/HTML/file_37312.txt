<span class="headword">Cooke,  Mordecai Cubitt</span>  (1825&#150;1914), <span class="occ">naturalist and mycologist</span>, was born on 12 July 1825 at the post office in Horning, Norfolk, the eldest in the family of five sons and three daughters of Mordecai Cooke (1799&#150;1869), village shopkeeper, and his wife, Mary (1803&#150;1885), postmistress and village herbalist, daughter of William Cubitt, schoolmaster, of Neatishead, Norfolk. Cooke was educated at the village dame-school until he was ten, and then to the age of thirteen by his uncle, James Cubitt, a Baptist minister, first in Ilford and later in Stratford upon Avon. He then spent a year at a commercial school at Neatishead before being apprenticed for five years to a wholesale draper in Norwich.<br>
<br>In 1844 Cooke moved to London, where he obtained employment as a clerk. Then, influenced by his aunt Naomi Treen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cubitt), a teacher at a Pestalozzian elementary school, he obtained in 1851 the post of master at Holy Trinity national school, Lambeth, where he was allowed to pioneer revolutionary teaching methods in natural history and to set up a school museum. He published influential articles in the <span class="italic">School and the Teacher</span> and helped to found a museum for London teachers. In 1859 he passed first class in botany in the first examination for teachers organized by the Department of Science and Art, his sole academic qualification. The same year he resigned from teaching, undertook a variety of part-time jobs, and published his first books; in 1862 he joined the civil service on the staff of the India Museum, where he remained until 1880.<br>
<br>Cooke was slight in build with grey eyes, red hair, and luxuriant red moustache and beard. On 4 January 1846 he married Sophia Elizabeth (1823&#150;1897), daughter of Abraham Biggs, tobacconist, who brought with her her two-year-old illegitimate daughter, Annie Elizabeth Thornton Biggs (1844&#150;1920). Cooke had no children with his wife, but from the age of seventeen Annie bore him three sons and a daughter. In 1871 Annie left Cooke to marry his step-second cousin, John Quincey Cubitt, but by 1875 had left Cubitt and returned to Cooke, bringing with her her young daughter by Cubitt. She then had two more sons and a daughter by Cooke before finally leaving him about 1890, taking with her Cubitt's daughter and Cooke's two youngest sons. Cooke gave her an allowance and she remained in touch with the family. Sophia apparently never left Cooke and died in 1897.<br>
<br>Cooke's lifelong passion for natural history began in childhood, and he made it his prime duty to popularize the subject, writing fourteen books for the layman. In 1862 he founded the Society of Amateur Botanists; in 1865 he was co-founder, with his publisher Robert Hardwicke, and editor, of the immensely popular magazine <span class="italic">Science Gossip</span>, and soon afterwards founded the Quekett Microscopical Club. He regarded fieldwork as of fundamental importance in the study of natural history.<br>
<br>Cooke's interest in fungi began while he was teaching, and in 1862 he published the first popular book on toadstools, <span class="italic">A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi</span>. This was followed by <span class="italic">Rust, Smut, Mildew and Mould</span> (1865), on plant pathogenic fungi, which was used in teaching in America. He was now in close touch with the Revd M. J. Berkeley, the &#145;father of British mycology&#146;, whom he eventually succeeded as Britain's leading mycologist. As Cooke's name became known through his huge output of taxonomic works, especially the two-volume <span class="italic">Handbook of British Fungi</span> (1871) and the journal <span class="italic">Grevillea</span>, which he founded in 1875 and edited himself, he entered into a vast correspondence with distinguished mycologists worldwide. In 1880 he was seconded to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, as its first cryptogamic botanist, and redoubled his mycological studies, publishing, among much else, his monumental eight-volume <span class="italic">Illustrations of British Fungi</span> (1881&#150;91). In all he published about 350 books and papers.<br>
<br>In 1892, with an international reputation, Cooke retired, having sold his herbarium to Kew, but he continued to write, his <span class="italic">Fungoid Pests of Cultivated Plants</span> (1906) being very well received. He became a scientific adviser to the Royal Horticultural Society and travelled the country attending the fungus forays of natural history societies and popularizing fungi among the public.<br>
<br>Cooke could never forget his humble origins. He lived in an unfashionable part of London (from 1870 until 1898 at 146 Junction Road, Kentish Town), and had no financial reserves. He was ill at ease with the gentleman scientists of his day and was treated as a mere technician by many, and consequently never achieved any position of responsibility. Scientifically, however, he was no respecter of persons, and entered vigorously into the polemics of the day. He was happiest at the field meetings of natural history societies and the subsequent festivities, where he could give free rein to his talents as a ballad singer and after-dinner speaker. He was a considerable artist, illustrating many of his own books. Though a strict Baptist, teetotaller, and political progressive in his youth, he later left organized religion, enjoyed alcoholic refreshment, and joined the Primrose League. The modest honours he received were mainly from natural history societies, but in 1873 he was awarded the honorary degree of MA by Yale University, in 1902 the Victoria medal of honour by the Royal Horticultural Society, and in 1903 the gold medal of the Linnean Society. He was an honorary member of American, French, and Italian scientific societies.<br>
<br>Having become progressively weaker and almost blind, Cooke died on 12 November 1914 at his daughter's home at Dunluce, 38 Lindley Avenue, Southsea, Hampshire, and was buried in the same grave as his wife, Sophia, in Islington cemetery. A clump of toadstools is carved on his headstone.<br>
