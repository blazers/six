<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Compton,  Spencer Joshua Alwyne</span>, second marquess of Northampton  (1790&#150;1851), <span class="occ">patron of science and the arts</span>, was born on 2 January 1790 at Erlestoke Park, Wiltshire, the second son of Charles Compton, ninth earl and first marquess of Northampton, and Mary, only daughter of Joshua Smith, MP for Devizes. Educated privately by Edward Meyrick at Ramsbury, Wiltshire, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1808, where he studied mainly mathematics under George Frederick Tavel, his tutor. As a nobleman he proceeded to his MA in 1810 after only six terms in residence and without taking any examination. He subsequently received two honorary degrees (LLD, Cambridge, in 1835, and DCL, Oxford, in 1850). At Cambridge he acquired and cultivated wide intellectual tastes in science, literature, and the fine arts, and formed enduring friendships with such contemporaries as George Peacock, Adam Sedgwick, Thomas Musgrave, John Frederick William Herschel, and William Empson.<br>
<br>In May 1812, shortly after the assassination of Spencer Perceval, the prime minister (and a relative), Lord Compton (as he styled himself) succeeded him as MP for Northampton and remained there until he lost the seat in the general election of 1820. Although his immediate relatives were all high tories, he soon showed his independence: a maverick tory, he would on occasion vote with the whigs and oppose his own party, which censured him as impractical and crotchety. Preferring direct to indirect taxation, he opposed the repeal of the property tax in 1816; and he supported Wilberforce's attempts to secure the total abolition of slavery in Africa, and James Mackintosh's work as a criminal law reformer. By 1819 he was at odds with both the foreign and home secretaries (Castlereagh and Sidmouth); the former accused him of &#145;turning his back on himself&#146;. His whiggish tendencies were ascribed to the influence of his wife, Margaret Maclean Clephane, eldest daughter and heir of Major-General Douglas Maclean Clephane, whom he married on 24 July 1815. She was a poet, a great favourite of Sir Walter Scott, a good musician, and an accomplished artist. Although her poetry was praised by Wordsworth for its simplicity, pathos, and energy, it was never published, but was edited after her death by her husband, and printed privately in 1833. Theirs was a happy marriage and they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1820 to 1830 Compton and his wife lived in Italy, often in Rome, where they not only pursued connoisseurship but also protected victims of despotism in Lombardy and Naples. Compton succeeded his father as marquess of Northampton on 24 May 1828, but remained in Italy until his stay was ended by domestic tragedy: after the birth of their sixth child, on 14 March 1830, his wife died suddenly on 2 April. Northampton returned to England, and thereafter lived mainly at Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire. After 1830 the rich, aristocratic widower began to transform himself into one of the &#145;good and the great&#146; in polite cultural life. He was dutiful as a politician (supporting constitutional change in the early 1830s, and in 1832 announcing an unsuccessful bill to repeal the law under which an MP, if made a minister, had to vacate his seat and seek re-election), but he was not as active in the House of Lords as he had been in the Commons. Instead he devoted himself to the advancement of literature, the fine arts, archaeology, and, especially, science.<br>
<br>Northampton gained some recognition as a minor poet, but his major venture in literature was to initiate and oversee <span class="italic">The Tribute</span> (1837), a miscellany of poems published by subscription for the benefit of Edward Smedley, who was poor and severely ill. Northampton subscribed for twenty copies, but was offended when his assistant, Monckton Milnes, suggested he should read some proofs. From 1849 until his death Northampton was president of the Royal Society of Literature. In the field of antiquities and archaeology he was a minor performer and a major organizer. He was an accomplished draughtsman, and had a fine collection of Etruscan vases, but his forte was office holding: he was a trustee of the National Gallery and of the British Museum, and president of the Architectural Society of the Archdeaconry of Northampton. He was twice president of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1845&#150;6 and in 1850&#150;51) and was responsible for its name, which he coined after the British Archaeological Association (founded in 1843) had split in the spring of 1845, when a small faction seceded. He presided at the association's meeting in the summer and suggested, as an affordable concession, that its own title be changed to Archaeological Institute in order to prevent the seceding party (which retained the title of Association) from feeling aggrieved; characteristically he refrained from attacking the secessionists.<br>
<br>It was this ability to avoid faction fighting and malice and to promote tactful reconciliation which facilitated Northampton's most notable achievement: in 1838 he was elected president of the Royal Society of London, which office he held until his resignation in 1848. Although he was not a leading scientist he had a sustained interest in geology, on which he published three short papers. His large collection of minerals (including Comptonite found near Vesuvius) and fossils at Castle Ashby was renowned. Conversation there was often focused on geology. Once his daughter, Marian [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/342/', "Egerton, Marianne Margaret, Viscountess Alford")</script>], later a well-known artist, revealed her exasperation with a long discussion about a motto for the Geological Society of London: her solution was to have for its crest a mole with the motto &#145;I bore&#146;. To the end of his life Northampton remained a zealous hammerer for fossils: in 1849 his unflagging efforts astonished an Arundel chalk-pit worker who remarked &#145;That man doan't work for his living; if he went on that gate he could do nought next day&#146;  (Owen, 1.340). Northampton's house parties at Castle Ashby were useful rehearsals for the fashionable soir&eacute;es he gave as president of the Royal Society in the large town house in Piccadilly which he inherited in the summer of 1838. He came to be president through his commitment to the British Association for the Advancement of Science (founded in 1831). In 1836 he became a nationally prominent cultural figure when his popular manners, oratory, and good humour made him a resounding success as president of the association, even though he was a last-minute substitute for the president-elect. Subsequently he was in great demand. In 1837 he became a vice-president of both the Royal Society and the Geological Society (having been an absentee president of the latter in 1820&#150;22), and in the autumn of 1838 he replaced the duke of Sussex as president of the Royal Society, one wag commenting that the society had descended from royalty to the nobility. He remained deeply involved in the association's affairs, serving as its president in 1848 and ensuring that the Royal Society and the association acted in amity. As president of the Royal Society he was distinguished by his kindness, courtesy, good humour, patience, responsibility, and tact, as well as by his splendid hospitality, mastery of continental languages, and cultured mind. He avoided being a tyrant, a cipher, or a tool; but his reign saw one scandal and some great changes within the society. In 1845 a royal medal was awarded illegally to T. S. Beck, which led <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> to denounce the society's council as &#145;the last Old Sarum of the scientific world&#146; and Northampton (who admitted the council's error, though he was not personally involved in its irregularity) as an autocrat. Although he was not an innovator by temperament or conviction, Northampton did not oppose reform when it was widely supported. In 1847 the age of the almost exclusively scientific Royal Society began, largely as a result of the efforts of William Grove and Leonard Horner: each year only fifteen fellows were to be elected from a list drawn up by the council. Northampton acquiesced in such changes but deplored what he regarded as the ill-mannered and offensive conduct of the reformers. Early in 1848 he showed his chagrin by resigning as president, thoughtfully giving the reformed society nine months in which to find a successor.<br>
<br>For several years Northampton was afflicted by an illness which caused him to spit blood. He was deeply affected by the death of his son-in-law, Lord Alford, on 3 January 1851, and was discovered dead in bed on the morning of the 17th, at Castle Ashby, where he was buried on the 25th.<br>
