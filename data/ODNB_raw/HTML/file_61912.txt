<span class="headword">Scanlan,  James Donald</span>  (1899&#150;1976), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Glasgow</span>, was born on 24 January 1899 at 511 Duke Street, Glasgow, the fifth of the seven children of Joseph Scanlan (1861&#150;1950), medical practitioner, and his wife, Sarah Veronica Walls (1861&#150;1922). Scanlan was born into a Roman Catholic family and, after schooling in the city at St Mungo's Academy and St Aloysius' College, he matriculated in 1915 in the faculty of medicine of Glasgow University. It was, however, wartime, so in November 1916 he entered Sandhurst and the following September was commissioned second lieutenant in the Highland light infantry. After service in Egypt from May 1918 to January 1919 he resigned his commission in July. In 1920 he matriculated at Glasgow once again, this time in law, and graduated BL in 1923. Having studied at St Edmund's College, the seminary at Ware, Hertfordshire, from 1924, he was ordained priest for Westminster diocese on 29 June 1929. That autumn he entered the canon law faculty of the Institut Catholique, Paris, graduating licentiate in 1930, then went on to the Apollinare in Rome and graduated doctor in 1932.<br>
<br>After returning to London, Scanlan became assistant priest at St James's, Spanish Place. However, his work in the diocesan marriage tribunal took up increasingly more of his time, until at last in 1938 he became chaplain to a convent in Hammersmith (where during the war he and the nuns were twice bombed out). In 1937 he was appointed diocesan vice-chancellor and was created a domestic prelate (colloquially a monsignor). He succeeded as chancellor in 1944. In 1945 he was made vicar delegate for the United States forces in Britain, with merely nominal duties.<br>
<br>The year 1946 saw Scanlan's return to Scotland. Appointed coadjutor bishop of Dunkeld (with the titular see of Cyme), he received episcopal ordination at Dundee on 20 June 1946. He succeeded as bishop of Dunkeld on 31 May 1949, was translated to Motherwell diocese on 23 May 1955 and finally, on 29 January 1964, was appointed archbishop of Glasgow, a position he held until he resigned on 23 April 1974. His health thereafter declined rapidly. He returned to London but died only three weeks after his arrival there, on 25 March 1976. His body was brought to Glasgow and lay in the cathedral until its interment in Dalbeth cemetery; in December 1979 it was reinterred in the cathedral crypt.<br>
<br>Although as bishop in Motherwell he oversaw much progress and expansion, it is for his ten years in Glasgow that Scanlan is most remembered. J. D., as he was often referred to, retained great affection for his native city and used to reminisce about the Great Exhibition of 1912, during his boyhood. His recreation as archbishop was to walk round the city and he greatly appreciated the honorary DD he received in 1967 from Glasgow University. His was a striking personality, with apparently opposing traits. His military and legal training showed itself in various ways: a meticulous use of language in all his pronouncements, a punctilious insistence on rules in business dealings with his clergy, a refusal to talk shop outside office hours. In his private life and spiritual duties he was most orderly. Yet he combined this with a liking for ceremonial and full formal dress. A raconteur, with archaic turns of speech, he yet gained the respect and liking of his priests, whose backgrounds and careers were so different from his own.<br>
<br>In Motherwell and Glasgow he established good relations with civic and other leaders. All doors were opened to him. At Westminster his work had made him widely known; at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s he took the opportunity to meet eminent churchmen from all over the world. It was this trait that brought about the achievement he is most remembered for. In January 1971 sixty-six Glasgow Rangers supporters were crushed to death at a football match against their local rivals, Celtic. The archbishop at once arranged a requiem mass in his cathedral, to which he invited the city leaders and both clubs, despite the religious bigotry which poisoned their relations, and both accepted. It was a truly historic occasion.<br>
<br>Physically, though not tall he was broad and strong. Indeed, shortly after his promotion to Glasgow, he vaulted on to the stage at a public meeting, letting everyone see that at sixty-five he was not too old for the job! Academically gifted though he was, he published little. He translated two books from French: one was <span class="italic">Pastors and People</span> by &Eacute;tienne Magnin (1930), on canon law, and the other was <span class="italic">Judaism</span> by Auguste Vincent (1934). In the Stair Society's <span class="italic">An Introduction to Scottish Legal History</span> (1958) he provided an article on medieval marriage law.<br>
