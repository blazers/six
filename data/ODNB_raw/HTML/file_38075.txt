<span class="headword">Trapnel,  Anna</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1642&#150;1660), <span class="occ">self-styled prophet</span>, was born in Poplar, Stepney, Middlesex, apparently the only child of William Trapnel (<i>d</i>. before 1645?), shipwright, and a godly mother who exerted seminal influence by raising her daughter as a literate woman of middle rank and teaching her to think of herself as uniquely chosen.<br>
<br>Anna experienced her first vision in 1642 at a sermon preached by John Simpson. The harrowing death of her mother, probably in 1645, was followed by an intense quest for salvation and truth, involving phases of suicidal Calvinist despair, fasting, trances, visions, and associations with various puritan congregations. In her pamphlet <span class="italic">The Cry of a Stone</span> (1654) she records a Damascene illness in 1647 which gave rise to a sequence of successful prophetic visions: weeks prior to the New Model Army's bloodless entry into London on 6 August to quell counter-revolution and mob rule she predicted their &#145;coming-in <i>Southwark</i>-way&#146;; in 1650 she foresaw Cromwell's defeat of the Scots at Dunbar, &#145;a <i>Gideon</i>&#146; provided by God &#145;so surely should the <i>Scots</i> be ruinated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cry</span>, sigs. A3<i>r</i>, A3<i>v</i>). That year she joined John Simpson's millenarian Baptist congregation at All Hallows-the-Great and forged links with other radical ministers (Henry Jessey, John Greenhill, and Christopher Feake). In 1652 Anna predicted victory over the Dutch and the calling-in of the Jews preparatory to the apocalypse, and in 1653 Cromwell's dissolution of the Barebones Parliament, in which her fellow Fifth Monarchists sat: envisioning four days before it happened &#145;that suddenly <i>Gideon</i> &hellip; and M[ajor] G[eneral] <i>Harrison</i> came into the Parliament-house and desired removal of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cry</span>, sig. B1<i>v</i>). Finally disenchanted with Cromwell when he declared himself protector on 16 December 1653 (which she claimed to have predicted), Anna accompanied Vavasor Powell, the fiery Welsh Independent minister, during his examination for treason at Whitehall, where, seized by the prophetic afflatus, she was taken to Mr Roberts's hostelry, there to rhapsodize in verse, &#145;lying in bed with her eyes shut, her hands fixed, seldom seen to move&#146; for eleven days and twelve nights, in bursts of several hours, her inspirations being recorded by a scribe at the bedside, which was visited by sundry notable radical sectaries  (<span class="italic">Cry</span>, sig. A1<i>v</i>). Her prophecies included God's punishment of Cromwell's corruption, spiritual advice to merchants, promises to the &#145;saints&#146; of becoming &#145;Potentates&#146; in the coming millennium, and invective against universities and churches. The text was published in <span class="italic">The Cry of a Stone</span>.<br>
<br>Anna became a celebrity, viewed by the protectorate as seditious. In 1654 she published a spiritual autobiography, <span class="italic">A Legacy for Saints</span>. Her authenticity was tested by sceptics, such as the anonymous letter-writer of 21 December 1654, who noted that she was &#145;so stiffened in her body &hellip; one would think her dead&#146; and that &#145;she cannot make a verse when she is herself&#146;, persisting for eight days at a stretch without food, &#145;save once in twenty-four hours a little &hellip; small beer&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A21, p. 325).<br>
<br>In her <span class="italic">Report and Plea</span> (1654) Anna described her journey to Cornwall at the behest of God and the imprisoned millenarian ministers, Feake and Simpson, to liaise with Fifth Monarchist Captain Langden, MP in the Barebones Parliament, and local militants including John Bawden and Thomas Allen in Truro. She described interrogation while in a trance by JPs who &#145;pincht me by the nose and caused my pillow to be pull'd from under my head &hellip; but I heard none of all this stir and bussle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report and Plea</span>, sig. D3<i>r</i>). At her assize's trial she was accused of witchcraft, madness, whoredom, vagrancy, and seditious intent. Anna defended herself nervously but vehemently as a free single woman (and hence masterless), whose right to pray, publish, and travel were founded in common and divine law, backed by her rights as taxpayer.<br>
<br>Following her arrest on 23 March 1654 Anna was sent, via Plymouth, by ship to Portsmouth and then to Bridewell, where she was cared for by women members of the All Hallows congregation, especially Ursula Adman, who &#145;kept me company seven weeks &hellip; she was a friend born for the day of adversity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report and Plea</span>, sig. G2<i>v</i>). Anna now set up as a martyr, writing inflammatory letters from prison, and the protectoral government found it prudent to release her on 26 July 1654. In 1656 she revisited Cornwall, canvassed Wales, and was said to be meditating an excursion to the continent. Trance doggerels of 1657 and 1658 were collected in a thousand-page printed folio volume, placed in the Bodleian Library, which, with <span class="italic">A Voice for the King of Saints and Nations</span> (1658), records her dispute with the Quakers (often mistaken by contemporaries for Fifth Monarchists because of their ecstatic and anti-judicial stance). Scathing Quaker representatives were present at these sessions, at which Anna boasted her vintage as God's seasoned chosen prophet (&#145;Poor Instrument hath found thee, Lord, / For fourteen years together&#146;), urging the scribe to keep up and condemning the culture of literacy (&#145;Antichrist's libraries&#146;) as inferior to the unmediated voice. Latterly dissociating herself from the violent militancy of Venner, she loudly espoused politically quietist millenarianism.<br>
<br>Anna was a touchstone for interregnum female seers. Her writing style, close to the spoken word, is quirkily na&iuml;ve, rapturous, canny, and sublimely innocent of humour, with a vein of nature mysticism and a testamentary realism. Her catatonic trances negotiated the danger of criminal stigmatization as immodest, demented, or demonic, identifying her as the Almighty's supine &#145;handmaid&#146;, &#145;vessel&#146;, and mouthpiece: &#145;thy Servant is made a voice &hellip; a voice within a voice &hellip; even thy voice through her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cry</span>). Anna dropped out of public knowledge after the Restoration.<br>
