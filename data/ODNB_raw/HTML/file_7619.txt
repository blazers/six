<span class="headword">Dickson,  Robert</span>  (1804&#150;1875), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Dumfries. Educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and Edinburgh University he graduated MD in 1826 with a thesis on pulmonary consumption. His love of botany began at Edinburgh, leading him to an extensive knowledge and use of vegetable remedies in his medical practice. He became licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1830 and fellow in 1855. In 1834 Dickson married Mary Ann Coope, daughter of a member of the celebrated brewing firm of Ind Coope &amp; Co. In London he looked for a post at a teaching hospital and began by lecturing on botany at St George's Hospital medical school and also at the private medical school in Webb Street, Southwark, established by Edward Grainger in 1819. In 1848 Dickson was disappointed not to receive the support of the medical staff and governors at St George's in his application to be elected physician there and this failure he felt coloured his future practice in London. As a result his clinical appointments were varied and widespread. He was visiting physician to the Camberwell House Lunatic Asylum, physician to the Scottish Hospital, 7 Crane Court, Fleet Street, the British Orphan Asylum in St Mary Axe, and the London branch of the Edinburgh Life Assurance Office (established 1823). In 1855 he assisted his friend Major the Hon. Henry Littleton Powys Keck in founding the Soldiers' Daughters' Home in Rosslyn Hill, Hampstead. Originally intended for destitute war orphans, it later took the daughters of serving officers or retired soldiers. They were admitted from infancy to thirteen and left at the age of sixteen, the able ones being trained to become teachers. Dickson also selected all the shrubs and flowers for the garden. In 1841 he sat on the founding committee of the Brompton Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest.<br>
<br>Dickson was a fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and of the Linnean Society, and was a member of the Microscopical Society. In 1837 he gave a lecture to the Institute of British Architects, &#145;Dry rot and the most effectual means of preventing it&#146;. He wrote popular articles on science in the weekly <span class="italic">Church of England Magazine</span> under the heading: &#145;Sacred philosophy: contributions to the natural theology of the vegetable kingdom&#146;, and also many of the articles on materia medica and therapeutics in the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span> (1833&#150;43) including one on wine, of which his knowledge was extensive and his cellar well stocked. In the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Magazine</span>, 1839, it is said that Dickson gave the botanical descriptions in the first volume and part of the second of Maund's <span class="italic">Botanist</span> which included a collection of fifty articles, each devoted to one plant with a full description of genus, species, character of genus, where grown, derivation of name, and reference in other journals. Dickson had been stimulated to involve himself in this work by Mr Bentham, the secretary to the Horticultural Society. Dickson was also a patron of popular music and art, and was an early subscriber to the Art Union of London, established in 1837.<br>
<br>Dickson was also an early and earnest advocate of sanitary reform. When the cholera epidemic broke out in London in 1831 he offered his house for a cholera hospital to show his contempt of others for their fear of contagion. He was one of the original promoters and guarantors of the public baths and wash houses in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Dickson was an honest, active, learned, and well cultivated gentleman, a friend to any deserving person. In spite of this his practice was small and select, mainly as a result of his failure to be appointed to the clinical staff of St George's Hospital or any other teaching hospital in London.<br>
<br>Dickson and his wife lived for a time at 14 Finsbury Square but soon moved west to 16 Hertford Street, Mayfair. In 1868, with his retirement from active practice, they moved to Cambridge Lodge, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, where Dickson enjoyed gardening. His wife died shortly before him in July 1875. On the evening of 9 October 1875 he took a hot bath and badly scalded his right hand and both legs. Shock and collapse followed and although he seemed to recover he died on 13 October. Of their six children, Frederick John joined the civil service in Ceylon; Robert Bruce entered the church; Charlotte married C. Major, and three daughters, Frances Barton, Anna Maria Emily, and another whose name is unknown, were unmarried at his death.<br>
