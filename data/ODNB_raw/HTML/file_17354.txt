<span class="headword">Macbean,  Alexander</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">writer and amanuensis</span>, of whose origins nothing is known, was employed as an amanuensis by the encyclopaedist Ephraim Chambers. After this he became one of the six amanuenses employed by Samuel Johnson on his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. About 1758 Johnson obtained for him the post of librarian to Archibald Campbell, third duke of Argyll. When, on the duke's death in 1761, Macbean was left &#145;without a shilling&#146;, he became mainly dependent upon charity. Johnson, who praised his learning and faculty for languages, but described his &#145;ignorance of life&#146; as complete, subsequently advised him to write a geographical dictionary, and wrote a preface for his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Ancient Geography</span> when it appeared in 1773. The book was well conceived, but Johnson confessed to Madame D'Arblay it destroyed his hopes of Macbean's doing anything properly &#145;when he found he had given as much labour to Capua as to Rome&#146;  (Fanny D'Arblay, <span class="italic">Diary</span>). Two years later, when Macbean was starving, as his former colleague, Peyton, had already done, Johnson gave him 4 guineas and collected more  (Piozzi, 1.218), and in 1780, through his influence with Lord Thurlow, obtained him admission as a poor brother to the Charterhouse. There he died on 26 June 1784, removing, Johnson lamented, &#145;a screen between him and death&#146;  (cf. <span class="italic">Works of the Rev. Jonathan Swift</span>, 11.246). Johnson said of him: &#145;He was very pious; he was very innocent; he did no ill, and of doing good a continual tenour of distress allowed him few opportunities.&#146;<br>
<br>Besides the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Ancient Geography</span> Macbean published, in 1743, <span class="italic">A synopsis or short analytical view of chemistry, translated from the high Dutch of Dr Godfrey Rothen</span>, and in 1779 he compiled <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Bible</span>. He also compiled numerous indexes, including that to Johnson's edition of the <span class="italic">English Poets</span>  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.30).<br>
