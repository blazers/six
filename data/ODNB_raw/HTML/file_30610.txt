<span class="headword">Barnett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rowland]</span>, Dame  Henrietta Octavia Weston</span>  (1851&#150;1936), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born in Clapham, Surrey, on 4 May 1851, the daughter of Alexander William Rowland (<i>d</i>. 1869), whose family fortune derived from Rowland's Macassar Oil Company, and Henrietta Monica Margaretta Ditges (<i>d</i>. 1851). Her mother died shortly after giving birth to Henrietta, who was raised in comfort by her father. Her formal education consisted of several terms spent at a boarding-school in Dover run by the Haddon sisters, disciples and sisters-in-law of the controversial aural surgeon and social and moral philosopher James Hinton. Given Hinton's and the Haddons' commitment to social altruism it is not surprising that Henrietta first demonstrated compassionate interest in the lives of poor children during her student days. Upon the death of her father in 1869 she devoted herself to helping the housing and charity reformer Octavia Hill conduct her philanthropic labours in the parish of St Mary's, Bryanston Square, Marylebone. Hill introduced her to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30612/', "Samuel Augustus Barnett (1844&#150;1913)")</script>, a fellow worker and curate at St Mary's. They were an unlikely pair: she was, as her friend Beatrice Webb described her, &#145;pretty, witty and well-to-do&#146;  (B. Webb, <span class="italic">My Apprenticeship</span>, New York edn, 1926, 204); he was awkward in appearance and manners. But their shared passion for helping the poor convinced her that the &#145;gift&#146; of Samuel's love &#145;was too holy to refuse&#146;  (H. Barnett, <span class="italic">Canon Barnett</span>, 1.53). On 28 January 1873 they married, and embarked on their remarkable collaboration as social reformers, and husband and wife, in the impoverished parish of St Jude's, Whitechapel, in east London. Beatrice Webb saw the Barnetts as &#145;an early example of a new type of human personality, in after years not uncommon; a double-star-personality, the light of the one being indistinguishable from that of the other&#146;  (Webb, 182).<br>
<br>From the outset Henrietta Barnett was her husband's equal partner in all their celebrated initiatives. She quickly threw herself into parish work on behalf of women and children, and gathered a circle of devoted women workers around her. In 1875 she was the first nominated woman guardian, and in the next year began her long association with the poor law district schools at Forest Gate, as a school manager. Despite her rescue work with female prostitutes and her belief that women should have the parliamentary franchise she was associated with neither the campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> nor the movement for female suffrage. She preferred to use her formidable creative energies and skills as an organizer more directly towards improving the lives of the London poor. She was a co-founder in 1876 of the Metropolitan Association for the Befriending of Young Servants and long-time leader of its Whitechapel branch. Her experiment, in 1877, of sending slum children for restorative country holidays grew into the Children's Country Holiday Fund (1884). She played a leading role in the departmental committee appointed to inquire into &#145;the condition of Poor Law Children&#146;, which led her and her sister Alice's husband, Dr Ernest Hart, to form in 1896 the State Children's Association, with Henrietta Barnett as honorary secretary.<br>
<br>In 1884 Henrietta and Samuel led the movement to establish the University Settlement in east London, better known as Toynbee Hall, in memory of their recently deceased friend the Oxford economic historian Arnold Toynbee. Settlements, as first envisioned by the Barnetts, were residential colonies of university men in the slums intended to serve both as centres of education, recreation, and community life for the local poor and as outposts for social work, social scientific investigation, and cross-class friendships between &eacute;lites and their poor neighbours. A paper that Henrietta delivered on settlement work to the Cambridge Ladies' Discussion Society in the Lent term of 1887 led to the proposal to found the first women's settlement: the Women's University Settlement in Southwark. An important female presence at all-male Toynbee Hall and an outspoken advocate for the worldwide growth of the settlement movement, she also expanded her innovative parish work during these years. As Toynbee Hall demanded more of Samuel's time he confessed in 1886 that Henrietta had become &#145;Church as well as home curate&#146;  (Samuel Barnett to Frank Barnett, Easter 1886, Barnett papers, LMA, F/Bar/132). To the chagrin of more conventional churchmen and women she and Samuel organized free musical concerts and oratorios on Sundays, as well as the renowned Whitechapel Picture Exhibition of fine art held each year, about Easter, in St Jude's schoolrooms. The latter developed into the Whitechapel Art Gallery, of which Henrietta remained a trustee from its founding in 1901 until her death. At nearly seventy-two she took up painting, and her pictures were hung in several Royal Academy exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1903 Henrietta Barnett embarked on her last and most ambitious project, which dominated the final decades of her life: rescuing 80 acres of Hampstead Heath for public enjoyment and creating the Hampstead Garden Suburb. She had long recognized that Toynbee Hall, with its transient and all-male population, was an &#145;artificial protest&#146;  (Barnett and Barnett, 338) against social divisions that could not serve as a society-wide model for those essential links between private domestic and public political life. Collaborating with the pioneer socialist architects of the Letchworth Garden City, Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker, she created a blueprint for a new kind of organic community consisting of young and old, able-bodied and infirm, rich and poor, married and unmarried. While the largest homes of wealthy residents were placed far from the modest cottages designed for artisans Henrietta hoped that residents of the suburb would be bound together by shared religious, social, educational, and recreational spaces. To this end she successfully advocated the erection of an Anglican church and a nonconformist chapel, along with a purpose-built clubhouse for artisans and their families; the institute, designed by Edwin Lutyens, served as the suburb's focal point for educational, cultural, and civic activity. Henrietta balanced her unwavering commitment to the mutual advantages of relationships between the classes with a staunch belief in the ineradicability of class differences. Autocratic and forceful in her dealings with others, her personality was tinged with &eacute;litist discomfort about the impact of the &#145;democratic microbe&#146;  (H. Barnett, &#145;Thrift in the home&#146;, <span class="italic">Charity Organisation Review</span> (June 1907), 307) on British society, and intolerance of her Jewish neighbours in Whitechapel. During her later years she vigorously supported two institutions: Barnett House at Oxford (1914), named in memory of Samuel, which remains the centre for social work and social policy education at the university; and the Dame Henrietta Barnett School (the foundation stone of which was laid on 23 October 1918), a single-sex, voluntary-aided school in Hampstead that emerged out of the educational programmes for girls at the institute.<br>
<br>Henrietta Barnett's many publications spanned fifty years and encompassed topics ranging from domestic economy (<span class="italic">The Making of the Home</span>, 1885) and human physiology (<span class="italic">The Making of the Body</span>, 1894) to social questions (<span class="italic">Practicable Socialism</span>, 1888; <span class="italic">Practicable Socialism, New Series</span>, 1915, and <span class="italic">Towards Social Reform</span>, 1909, all three written jointly with Samuel Barnett). She also wrote <span class="italic">Matters that Matter</span> (1930), a collection of quasi-autobiographical essays on various topics, and her most enduring monument to her partnership with Samuel: the two volume <span class="italic">Canon Barnett: his Life, Work, and Friends</span> (1918).<br>
<br>Henrietta Barnett valued highly motherhood and women's distinct moral gifts as peacemakers capable of defusing class war. Having no children of her own she was legal guardian of both her badly brain-damaged elder sister, Fanny, who shared her home for fifty-eight years, and of Dorothy Woods, the Barnetts' beloved adopted ward. From the 1890s Marion Paterson (whom Henrietta had first met in 1876) was her constant assistant, nurse, secretary, confidante, and companion. After Samuel's death, in 1913, her friendship and dependence upon Marion deepened, and it was Marion who received and responded to letters of condolence when Henrietta died, in their Hampstead home, on 10 June 1936. Henrietta had been appointed CBE in 1917 and DBE in 1924.<br>
