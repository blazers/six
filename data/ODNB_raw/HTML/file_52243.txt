<span class="headword">Cantelowe, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1464), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, is first recorded in 1427, when a complaint was lodged against him and his wife, Margaret. He was then described as a mercer. A Thomas Cantelowe, mercer, mentioned in 1410, may have been his father. In the 1430s William Cantelowe achieved some prominence as an administrator appointed by the crown: in 1431 he was collector of lay subsidy, in 1432 collector of alien subsidy and custom on cloth, both at London; from 1436 to 1440 he was victualler of Calais&#151;a responsible and demanding post, after the French attack of 1436. In 1441 the council decided, apparently after some debate, to allow him to ship wool to Calais independently of staple regulations, presumably in order to recover money due to him as victualler, and in 1442 he had permission to recover &pound;1506, a further sum owed to him as victualler.<br>
<br>Cantelowe is recorded as having many dealings with alien merchants, which were evidently connected with his activity in royal finance. In 1434 he guaranteed that a consignment of wool exported by Milanese to Antwerp would go on to Milan, and in 1440 he guaranteed another consignment going via Middelburg to Milan. Between 1440 and 1443 he is reported as engaged in buying fabrics from Lucchese and Venetians and selling cloth to them. In 1445 he was giving credit at Calais as a stapler for wool purchases by Dutch merchants. In the following year he became alderman for Cripplegate, a position he held until 1461. It was at this time that his substantial financial advances to the crown began. In 1445 he had lent money for the journey of Margaret of Anjou to England, before her marriage to Henry VI. In 1449 he was a contributor to the staple loan of &pound;10,700, and acted as agent for the other contributors in arranging assignments in repayment. Cantelowe was sheriff of London in 1448&#150;9. In the latter year he paid 500 marks owed by the crown to Jean de Luxembourg, the Bastard of St Pol, and in 1450 he advanced &pound;800 for the new college at Eton and was allowed, in return, to ship 300 sacks of wool from Southampton through the Strait of Gibraltar without paying customs or subsidies. This was apparently the background to an unusual shipment of 466 pokes of wool from Southampton to Pisa in 1451. The wool was handled on arrival by branches of the Salviati family and sold by them at Florence, the proceeds then being returned to their branch at London. Cantelowe had been dealing with the Salviati of London, to whom he had a debt of over &pound;4200, built up over several years for payments to woolmen, exchange payments at Bruges, and even drafts of cash. This debt was now cancelled by the proceeds of the sale at Florence, and it is clear that the Salviati had in fact financed the shipment for Cantelowe.<br>
<br>Cantelowe continued to be closely associated with the crown in the early 1450s. In 1450 he was one of those said in a political poem to be responsible for the corruption at court. In the same year he was master of the Mercers' Company, a post he also held in 1456 and 1462. In 1451 he was involved in a loan for the expenses of the king's household, while in 1454 he and others made a loan of &pound;304. In view of his connections with alien merchants and royal finance it is surprising that he was punished as a result of the London riots against the Italians in April 1456. As master of the Mercers he promised the mayor on 3 May that they would keep the peace, and he was himself imprisoned in Dudley Castle from October to December. The reason for the mercers' conduct was no doubt displeasure caused by the commercial policy of the crown, the favour it showed to aliens, and its neglect of staple privileges. Whether this displeasure was really shared by Cantelowe is not known. In any case the position was changed by the accession of Edward IV, which resulted in Cantelowe's being knighted in 1461; in the same year he was exonerated from duties as an alderman on the grounds of age and infirmity. He died in 1464 (his will, dated 21 February, was proved on 11 May), leaving property for life to his second wife, Elizabeth, with remainders to his sons Thomas, William, and Henry, and his daughters Anne, Joan, and Katherine. He was described as being of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, in London, and of Faversham. There were lands in Kent, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire.<br>
