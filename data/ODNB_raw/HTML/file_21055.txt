<span class="headword">Oxenford,  John</span>  (1812&#150;1877), <span class="occ">playwright and translator</span>, was born on 12 August 1812 at Camberwell, Surrey, the son of William Oxenford (1783&#150;1867), merchant, and his wife, sister of Thomas Massa Alsager. Acquiring most of his compendious knowledge as an autodidact, he was also privately educated for some two years under the tutorship of S. T. Friend. The latter probably tried to dissuade Oxenford from his dramatic career, considering that he had the &#145;highest philosophical faculties, together with a versatility of powers which pointed to another sphere&#146;, but was powerless, since Oxenford's &#145;dramatic taste &hellip; was developed so early that his heart was not to be given to other pursuits&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Urged by his family, however, Oxenford began his working life as an articled clerk with Willis &amp; Co. of Tokenhouse Yard, and was admitted to practise as a solicitor in 1833.<br>
<br>Apparently Oxenford did not much enjoy his profession, finding relief, like many of his colleagues, in the theatre. His first play, entitled <span class="italic">My Fellow Clerk</span> (Lyceum, 20 April 1835), is set in a lawyer's office and displays this autobiographical background. It was followed by a rapid succession of all types of drama which ended only two years before Oxenford's death. Out of his total of well over a hundred plays it is perhaps his farces that retain the greatest freshness today. They include such memorable successes as <span class="italic">A Day Well Spent</span> (Lyceum, 4 April 1836), which was adapted by J. Nestroy as <span class="italic">Einen Jux will er sich machen</span> (Vienna, 1845), and via Nestroy's adaptation formed the basis of such well-known pieces as Thornton Wilder's <span class="italic">The Merchant of Yonkers</span> (Boston, Massachusetts, 1936)&#151;later reworked, adapted, and turned into David Merrick's hit musical <span class="italic">Hello Dolly!</span>&#151;and Tom Stoppard's <span class="italic">On the Razzle</span> (Edinburgh, 1981). His numerous melodramas, most of which are adaptations or translations from the French, were equally applauded, particularly <span class="italic">The Two Orphans</span> (Olympic Theatre, 14 September 1874), based on Dennery and Cormon, but also <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> (Surrey Theatre, 5 February 1866), which was the most successful of the many adaptations of Mrs Henry Wood's novel.<br>
<br>Like many of his poorly paid fellow playwrights at the time, Oxenford also had to find other ways to make a living. About 1840 he became theatre critic for <span class="italic">The Times</span> through the influence of his uncle, Thomas Massa Alsager (1779&#150;1846), who managed the City department of <span class="italic">The Times</span> from 1817 to 1846. Although today his theatrical reviews would be considered of slight value as works of criticism, their concise plot summaries and often minute documentation of the productions render them a precious source to the theatre historian. Oxenford's greatest contribution to theatre criticism must, however, be seen in the respectability with which he endowed the profession. As the acclaimed &#145;doyen of critics&#146;, he was deferentially allowed a private box in all theatres  (Fitzgerald, 77f.).<br>
<br>Beyond his work connected with the theatre, the variety of Oxenford's interests is reflected in the many review articles he contributed to a long list of periodicals. His mature and independent critical judgement can best be exemplified by his article on Rabelais in the 1843 <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>, and by &#145;Iconoclasm in German philosophy&#146; in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> for 1853. The latter essay, an assessment of Schopenhauer's style and philosophical system, played a significant role in bringing about the German philosopher's final breakthrough to public recognition: not only in Great Britain, but, in its German translation in the <span class="italic">Vossische Zeitung</span> (May 1853), also in his own country.<br>
<br>Oxenford's work as a translator was equally fruitful. From the French he rendered a number of plays, including Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Tartuffe</span>; from the Spanish, Calder&oacute;n's <span class="italic">La vida es sue&ntilde;o</span> (<span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 1843) and several ballads (<span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, 1846). However, the foreign language in which he felt most at home was clearly German. His major translations of Goethe were that of <span class="italic">Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit</span> as <span class="italic">The Autobiography</span> (1848), and of <span class="italic">Die Wahlverwandschaften</span> as <span class="italic">Affinities</span>, first serialized in the <span class="italic">Musical World</span> (1846&#150;7); together with <span class="italic">Conversations with Eckermann and Soret</span> (1850), translated from <span class="italic">Gespr&auml;che mit Goethe</span> they set a high standard and were frequently re-edited, <span class="italic">The Autobiography</span> as recently as 1971. To this must be added a host of other serialized and minor translations of German legends, stories, and poems by such diverse authors as Gottfried August B&uuml;rger, Hermann Ferdinand Freiligrath, Heinrich Heine, Heinrich von Kleist, Lenau, Jean Paul and Friedrich R&uuml;ckert, to mention only a few.<br>
<br>Oxenford's original writings are more scarce. They, too, range from the musingly philosophical and romantic, such as the 173 sonnets included in the <span class="italic">Musical World</span> (1846&#150;50), to the witty and broadly humorous, such as his contributions to the early numbers of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, or Dickens's <span class="italic">Household Words</span>. Nevertheless they cannot be credited with the same merits as his other literary activities. Here, as with his manifold critical output, it appears that the focusing of the gleanings from his most diverse and wide reading, reliable judgement, and acquired literary taste into unified concepts and original textual structures ultimately eluded him.<br>
<br>Later in life Oxenford began to suffer from some form of pneumonial disease, which more or less disabled him during the last two years before his death. &#145;Long a deist&#146;, as Hawkins reports  (Hawkins, 89), he was received into the Roman Catholic church in September 1875. He died on 21 February 1877 at his home at 28 Trinity Square, Southwark, London. After a requiem mass at St George's Cathedral, Southwark, he was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 28 February. He had been married, albeit none too happily  (<span class="italic">Life and Reminiscences of E. L. Blanchard</span>, 1.134), and was survived by his wife, Alice, a son, John, and a daughter, Caroline.<br>
