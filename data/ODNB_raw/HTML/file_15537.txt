<span class="headword">Killigrew, Sir  Robert</span>  (1579/80&#150;1633), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born in Lothbury, London, the son of <a name="cosubject_15540"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Killigrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1622), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or after 1623), daughter of Thomas Saunders of Uxbridge, Middlesex, and grandson of John Killigrew of Arwennack, Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth Trewennard. William Killigrew and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15533/', "Henry Killigrew")</script>, made their fortunes at Elizabeth I's court. William, though less influential than Henry, acted as a diplomatic courier, became a groom of the privy chamber by 1576, farmed the fees from sealing writs in queen's bench and common pleas (from 1578), and was treasurer of the chamber in 1595. He held various offices in Cornwall and Devon, and sat in parliament for Grantham (1571), Helston (1572), Penryn (1584), Fowey (1593), and the county of Cornwall (1597). Knighted by James I at Theobalds on 7 May 1603, he was MP for Liskeard in 1604 and Penryn in 1614 and chamberlain of the exchequer in 1605&#150;8. In 1594 he was granted an eighty-year lease by the crown for the manors of Hanworth and Kempton in Middlesex. He died at his town house in Lothbury, London, on 23 November 1622, and was buried at St Margaret, Lothbury.<br>
<br>Robert Killigrew matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in January 1591, aged eleven, but took no degree. He entered politics as MP for St Mawes in the 1601 parliament, was knighted by James I in July 1603, and represented Newport in 1604. About this time he married Sir Francis Bacon's niece, Mary Woodhouse (<i>fl</i>. 1590&#150;1650), daughter of Sir Henry Woodhouse of Kimberley, Norfolk, and his wife, Ann, daughter of Sir Nicholas Bacon. Their eldest child, William, was baptized in May 1606. They had twelve children in all; nine (five sons and four daughters) lived to maturity.<br>
<br>By 1606 Killigrew was at court and he eventually entered the circle of the royal favourite Robert Carr and his friend Sir Thomas Overbury. In June 1612 John Chamberlain noted that Killigrew was one of Carr's &#145;next favorites&#146;, after Overbury himself  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.358). Early in May 1613, a few days after Overbury was imprisoned in the Tower, Killigrew was committed to the Fleet for talking with Overbury at his prison window. Killigrew was quickly released, however, and in July was one of two friends permitted to speak with the ailing Overbury. Still a prisoner in the Tower, Overbury died two months later.<br>
<br>As MP for Helston in 1614 Killigrew was involved in a serious altercation in the Commons' committee investigating &#145;undertaking&#146;. On 12 May, Sir William Herbert accused the committee's chairman, Sir Roger Owen, of partiality, and Killigrew, demanding that Owen &#145;should put no more tricks upon the House&#146;, grabbed the chairman and threatened to pull him out of his seat  (Jansson, 228&#150;9). The next day the Commons forced Killigrew to make a formal apology. His motives remain mysterious, but his friendships with Overbury and Sir Henry Neville, both of whom were rumoured to have devised schemes to manage parliament, suggest that he had some personal stake in the &#145;undertaking&#146; investigation.<br>
<br>In July 1614 Killigrew was appointed keeper for life of Pendennis Castle in Cornwall but in the early autumn of 1615 his fortunes at court were jeopardized by the arrest of Carr, now earl of Somerset, his wife, and several accomplices on suspicion of poisoning Overbury. Killigrew himself became entangled in the ensuing investigation. One of Somerset's servants testified that shortly after Overbury's imprisonment the former had obtained from Killigrew a potent emetic. Unbeknown to Killigrew, who thought the powder was for Carr, Carr and Overbury planned to use it to fake an illness they hoped would win royal mercy for Overbury. Though never under direct suspicion Killigrew was questioned by the commissioners investigating Overbury's death, and he spoke at Somerset's trial to counter the favourite's assertion that it was one of his powders that had sickened the imprisoned knight.<br>
<br>Despite Somerset's fall Killigrew had little difficulty maintaining his fortunes. Although he failed to secure a patent for the enrolment of apprentices in 1616 and risked royal wrath by duelling with a Captain Burton early in 1618, Killigrew steadily accumulated the fruits of court favour. In October 1618 he was granted the office of protonotary of chancery for life and in December 1619 the favourite, Buckingham, wrote on his behalf about a suit for &#145;certain concealed lands&#146;, stressing that Killigrew was a &#145;gentleman whom I love and wish very well unto&#146;  (Spedding, 7.69&#150;70).<br>
<br>During the 1620s Killigrew sat in the Commons for Newport (1621), Penryn (1624), the county of Cornwall (1625), Tregony (1626), and Bodmin (1628), and he played an occasional but by no means a major role in the contentious sessions of the decade. He was, however, an active patron on Buckingham's behalf in borough elections across Cornwall, where he had been appointed JP in 1617 and deputy lieutenant in 1623. As early as 1614 Killigrew used his family influence to secure for Sir James Whitelocke control of a seat at Helston, and in 1625 and 1626 he secured a seat at Penryn for Buckingham's client Sir Edwin Sandys.<br>
<br>In September 1625 it was reported that Killigrew was to become resident ambassador to the United Provinces; his appointment was confirmed that December, but he never took up residence, probably because his duties at Pendennis kept him in England during the military mobilization of the mid- and late-1620s. He proved an energetic keeper, constantly petitioning the privy council for more money, men, and ordnance, and was appointed to various commissions concerned with the local war effort, including the 1627 commission for the forced loan. He also continued to accumulate court favour and office. In March 1627 he began farming the fees for sealing writs in king's bench and common pleas, and early in 1630 he became vice-chamberlain to Queen Henrietta Maria. In his last years, he renegotiated the lease on his estates at Hanworth and Kempton, continued his Cornish responsibilities, and embarked on controversial fen drainage schemes in Lincolnshire. His entrepreneurial endeavours in the fens were the last of a string of business activities which included investments in the Virginia and New River Companies. Killigrew died at Hanworth in the spring of 1633 and his will was proved on 12 May 1633.<br>
<br>Killigrew was a cosmopolitan and cultured man. When the Dutch diplomat and poet Constantijn Huygens stayed with Killigrew in 1622 he was introduced by his host to many of London's cultural &eacute;lite, including John Donne, Sir Francis Bacon, the musician and painter Nicholas Lanier, the lutenist Jacques Gaultier, and the lens-grinder Cornelius Drebbel. Killigrew himself dabbled in lens-grinding and in medicine. His skill with medical concoctions had dragged him into the Overbury plot in 1613, and a manuscript of his &#145;Experimenta&#146; survives in a contemporary compendium of medical and scientific writings. Evidence of his cultural patronage is scarce, but two works&#151;Thomas Farnaby's 1615 edition of Martial's epigrams and a 1613 religious treatise by Thomas Broad&#151;were dedicated to him. Killigrew's personal religious sympathies are unclear. His uncle Henry had been an early and militant protestant, but it has been suggested, solely on the circumstantial evidence of his friendship with the Arminian Richard Thomson, that Killigrew himself had anti-Calvinist leanings.<br>
<br>His widow married Sir Thomas Stafford, gentleman-usher to Henrietta Maria, and a number of his children enjoyed lengthy court careers. Perhaps nurtured by the intellectual atmosphere of the Killigrew home, Killigrew's sons William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15538/', "Thomas Killigrew")</script> became playwrights, and his son Henry a noted divine. His daughter Elizabeth was an early mistress of Charles II, with whom she had an illegitimate daughter.<br>
