<span class="headword">Krapf,  (Johann) Ludwig</span>  (1810&#150;1881), <span class="occ">linguist of Swahili and first protestant missionary in east Africa</span>, was born on 11 January 1810 at Derendingen near T&uuml;bingen, in the kingdom of W&uuml;rttemberg, the youngest of four children of Johann Jakob Krapf (1773&#150;1846), peasant farmer, and his wife, Katherina Maria Braun (1776&#150;1846). In 1823 Ludwig Krapf entered the Anatolian school in T&uuml;bingen, where Latin, and later Greek and Hebrew, were among the subjects he learned. When he was still in the first form his father bought him an atlas of the world, and the young Ludwig wondered why so much of north-eastern Africa had been left blank; a little later a bookseller in T&uuml;bingen lent him an odd volume of Bruce's <span class="italic">Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile</span>, from which he learned of the existence of hyenas. At seventeen he entered the missionary college at Basel and remained there for two years. After a break to reconsider his vocation he returned to the college and was duly ordained in the Lutheran faith.<br>
<br>Krapf's original plan was to go to Smyrna as a missionary, so he began learning Turkish and modern Greek but, in 1836, the secretary of the London-based Church Missionary Society (CMS) was recruiting missionaries in Basel, and offered him a post in Abyssinia. He accepted, and was to remain with the society for nineteen years. In 1837, aged twenty-seven, Krapf travelled to Egypt, and thence to Abyssinia, where a CMS station had been founded in 1830 by Samuel Gobat. At first he worked in the Adwa area of Tigr&eacute;. Then, in June 1839, he moved to Ankober, the capital of the kingdom of Shoa, at the invitation of King Sahela Sellasie. In 1841 an English embassy under Major Cornwallis Harris arrived at Ankober and Krapf was able to render assistance as an interpreter. During this time he and another missionary assembled a collection of more than seventy Ethiopic manuscripts, which they presented to the British Museum. Krapf remained in Shoa until 1842, when he returned to Egypt. In that year he was awarded a doctoral degree by the University of T&uuml;bingen.<br>
<br>In September 1842, in the British chapel at Alexandria, Krapf married Rosine Dietrich (1817&#150;1844), the widow of another Basel missionary. He then returned to Abyssinia, hoping to re-enter Shoa, but permission was refused. In 1843 Rosine gave birth to a daughter, who lived for only a few hours. Frustrated in his endeavours to work among the Oromo (Galla) people, largely on account of opposition from Christian Abyssinians and from rival Roman Catholic missionaries, Krapf and his wife sailed for Zanzibar in 1843. Atkins Hamerton, Britain's first consul in Zanzibar, presented Krapf to the sultan, Sayyid Sa&#145;id bin Sultan al Busa&#145;idi, who had recently transferred his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar. Armed with a letter of introduction from the sultan, Krapf, the first European Christian missionary in east Africa since the Portuguese occupation, arrived in Mombasa in March 1844, where he was welcomed by the <i>liwali</i> (the sultan's representative), Ali bin Nasir al-Busa&#146;idi. Krapf and his wife were accommodated in Leven House, a property then owned by the sultan and close to the harbour. In July 1844 Rosine Krapf died, and was followed to the grave a few days later by her second infant daughter; both were buried at Mkomani, on the mainland north of Mombasa.<br>
<br>Krapf's first major task was to learn the Swahili language, which is both the language of the Swahili coast and also, in an attenuated form, the lingua franca of the east African interior. Indeed, Krapf was probably the first European to realize the potential of Swahili as a lingua franca, and the first to grasp that Swahili belonged to the &#145;Bantu&#146; family of languages (as they were later to be called). In 1849 he had published the first printed text in Swahili (three chapters of <span class="roman">Genesis</span> in roman script), and in 1850 the first systematic Swahili grammar appeared in T&uuml;bingen. In 1854 Krapf donated two Swahili manuscripts to the library of the Deutsche Morgenl&auml;ndische Gesellschaft, the first to reach Europe. In 1882 <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Suahili Language</span> was published posthumously in London. &#145;Of course the work cannot claim to having exhausted the complete treasure of the Suaheli language, but in fact no dictionary of any language can lay claim to absolute perfection&#146;  (CMS archives, CA5/016/172, 1878). However, there was some controversy as to Krapf's contribution. He wrote: &#145;In course of time, when [Johannes] Rebmann had mastered the language, he of course added his mite to the original ground-work of Dr Krapf&#146;  (CMS archives, CA5/016/160, 1880). The interest of this great pioneer lexicon is now historical rather than practical, but it also contains many valuable notes on Swahili customs. Altogether there are some twenty-five publications credited to Krapf's name, many concerned with language. He is considered the father of Swahili studies.<br>
<br>In 1844 Krapf had paid a brief visit to <i>kaya</i> Rabai, a settlement in the <i>nyika</i>, Mombasa's hilly hinterland. In 1846 he was joined by a compatriot, Johannes Rebmann (1820&#150;1876), and the two men went to live among the Rabai people who, from this time onwards, were to experience almost continuous exposure to European Christian missionaries. In 1848 Rebmann became the first European to see the snow-capped peaks of Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, while in the following year Krapf became the first European to see Mount Kenya.<br>
<br>After visiting W&uuml;rttemberg in 1850, Krapf returned to east Africa in 1851. In 1854 he visited the CMS headquarters in London, when it was decided that he should go to Jerusalem at the end of that year to confer with Bishop Samuel Gobat. He returned briefly to Abyssinia in 1855, when he met Emperor Tewodros. In 1856 his connection with the CMS ended, and he returned to W&uuml;rttemberg, devoting much of his time to translation work. In 1858 the publication of his <span class="italic">Reisen in Ostafrika</span> (&#145;Travels in east Africa&#146;) set an early, but seldom equalled model of careful observation. In 1867 he was again in Abyssinia, as an interpreter attached to the British army that Sir Robert Napier led to Magdala. Krapf was married again in 1857, to Charlotte Pelargus, and had one daughter. In 1862 he was back in east Africa in order to help Thomas Wakefield (1836&#150;1901) of the United Methodist Free Church to found a mission in <i>kaya</i> Ribe, not far from <i>kaya</i> Rabai. In 1868 Krapf's second wife died and in the following year he married Nanette Schmid; they had no children. He died at his home in Kornthal, W&uuml;rttemberg, on 26 November 1881, and was buried there.<br>
<br>Krapf's journeys prepared the way for the exploration of the great lakes and the sources of the Nile, while his contribution to evangelization, linguistics, and geography increased the tempo of the European scramble for Africa in the 1880s. From time to time Krapf has been compared to David Livingstone, but, in truth, Krapf was overshadowed by Livingstone, and never experienced the popularity that he enjoyed. In New Rabai the primary school (1848) was named after the mission's first convert to Christianity (the mission made one convert in its first ten years), but the secondary school (1967) was named after Krapf himself, while a small museum was established in 1998, with assistance from the German government, commemorating Krapf and Rebmann. In Nairobi, the building housing the German embassy was also named after Krapf. In 1934, at Mkomani, Mombasa, near the graves of Rosine and her infant daughter, a memorial to Krapf was unveiled with inscriptions in Swahili and English; an inscription in German was added later. Subsequently the Krapf Memorial Heritage Park was restored in 2009 with funds donated by the German embassy in Nairobi.<br>
