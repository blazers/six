<span class="headword">Shellabear,  William Girdlestone</span>  (1862&#150;1947), <span class="occ">missionary and Malay scholar</span>, was born on 27 August 1862 at Buttlands, Wells, Norfolk, the son of Samuel Shellabear, accountant, and manager of the earl of Leicester's estate at Holkham Hall, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Young. He was educated at Haileybury College from 1876 to 1879. Intending to pursue a military career, he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1879, and was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1882. From then until 1885 he studied at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham. In 1885 he underwent a conversion to evangelical Christianity before shipping out as an officer in the Royal Engineers to Singapore in 1886. There he became part of a close-knit fellowship of Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregational missionaries. Under the influence of William Oldham, founder of the American Methodist mission in Singapore, he had a second conversion, to &#145;holiness&#146; Christianity. He became known as the &#145;preaching captain&#146; for his frequent sermons to soldiers and sailors, and began to translate Christian hymns into Malay for the Malay soldiers under his command. In 1889 he returned to England, resigned his commission, and on 31 July 1890 married Fanny Maria Kealy, the 20-year-old daughter of John Robert Kealy, medical doctor.<br>
<br>Shellabear returned to Singapore with his new wife and joined the American Methodist mission. Over the next decade, with a brief hiatus in England where Fanny died in 1895 (leaving him with a son, Hugh), Shellabear built the Methodist Mission Press and began hymnals, tracts, and booklets in Malay (most of which he composed or translated) for the Bible Society and the Tract Society. His studies of the Malay language led to his publication of a new edition of the <span class="italic">Sejarah Melayu</span> (&#145;History of the Malays&#146;, 1896) followed by a series of published editions of Malay classical literature. He also wrote and published both <span class="italic">Malay&#150;English Vocabulary</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Practical Malay Grammar</span> (1899). His secular works cemented a long-standing relationship between the Methodist Mission Press and the colonial government, which used them in building up a system of Malay-medium schools.<br>
<br>In 1896 Shellabear was made presiding elder of the Methodist mission, and in this capacity had oversight of the entire mission. With other missionaries he vigorously attacked licensed prostitution and the sale of opium, while fending off attacks from Chinese nationalists who accused the Methodist Anglo-Chinese school of forcing children to convert to Christianity. Convinced that such English-medium schools were absorbing too many resources and missionary personnel, he was also engaged in a struggle with his fellow missionaries over the merits of vernacular versus English-language education. On 16 February 1897 he married Emmaline (Emma) Ferris (<i>d</i>. 1923), with whom he had two daughters, Fanny and Margaret, as well as bringing up his son from his marriage to Fanny Kealy.<br>
<br>In 1900 Shellabear left his various responsibilities with the Methodist mission and began to revise the Malay <span class="roman">Bible</span> while living from 1902 in Malacca with his family. He also worked with Sulaiman bin Muhammad Nur, with whom he edited two books of Malay proverbs and poetry, and served as superintendent of different Methodist districts in Malaya. He published his <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Malay in 1910 and his <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in Malay in 1912. From 1909 to 1911 he managed a rubber estate and orphanage in the midst of a Chinese Christian colony that the Methodists had built at Sitiawan, on the west coast of Malaya. There he began a translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into &#145;Baba Malay&#146;, the Malay dialect of the Straits Chinese, published in 1913. He once again took up residence in Singapore from 1912 to 1916.<br>
<br>Shellabear and his family went to the United States in 1916 to represent Singapore and Malaya at the Methodist general conference. Upon his return to Singapore in 1917 he became embroiled in struggles over leadership of the mission and suffered a mental and physical breakdown, forcing his return to the USA in 1918. An attempt to return to Singapore in 1920 ended with a breakdown in health even before reaching Singapore, and in the same year he officially retired from the mission. In 1922 he joined the staff of the Kennedy School of Missions at Hartford, Connecticut, as a teacher of Malay language and culture. Soon afterwards he travelled to Leiden to study Arabic with Snouck Hurgronje, and then to Cairo to learn <span class="roman">Koran</span> reading and vernacular Arabic. In 1924 he took a permanent position at Hartford, and remained there until his death, briefly occupying the chair of Muhammadan studies and serving as editor of the journal <span class="italic">Muslim World</span> until 1936.<br>
<br>In the final stage of Shellabear's career he sought to create a new kind of Malay Christian literature, sensitive to both the cultural and the religious heritage of the Malays. He translated the story of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and later the gospels, into classical Malay poetry or <i>shair</i>. First published in the 1930s, these books went through a number of editions in the next twenty years. Following the <i>shairs</i> he wrote commentaries on the gospels in Malay, concentrating on what he believed were key theological points of contact with Islamic teaching. These books enjoyed wide circulation, and were published in several editions. At the time of his death, in Hartford, on 16 January 1947, he was engaged in translating the <span class="roman">Koran</span> into Malay, as a tool for Christian evangelism.<br>
