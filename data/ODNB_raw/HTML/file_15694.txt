<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kitto,  John</span>  (1804&#150;1854), <span class="occ">writer and missionary</span>, son of John Kitto, a Cornish stonemason, and Elizabeth Picken, was born at Plymouth on 4 December 1804. He was a sickly lad, caring for nothing but books. Between his eighth and eleventh years he was at four different Plymouth schools, and had no other schooling. In 1814 he was taken by his father to assist him at his trade. On 13 February 1817, while carrying slates up a high ladder, he fell 35 feet, as a result of which he became stone-deaf. Unable to work, he was left to spend his time as he pleased, and devoted himself to reading, selling scraps of old iron, and painting children's pictures and shop labels to make money to buy books. On 15 November 1819 he was sent to the workhouse, where he was set to learn shoemaking. In November 1821 he was apprenticed to a Plymouth shoemaker named Bowden, who treated him badly, and in May 1822 he was taken back into the workhouse. In July 1823 some gentlemen became interested in his case, made provision for his support, and got permission for him to read in the public library. In 1824 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11688/', "Anthony Norris Groves")</script>, an Exeter dentist and one of the early Plymouth Brethren, took him as a pupil, giving him board, lodging, and a small salary. Soon after he underwent a religious conversion and in July 1825 went, at the suggestion of Groves, to the Missionary College at Islington, to be trained for employment by the Church Missionary Society as a printer at one of their foreign presses. In June 1827 he was sent by the society to Malta, but his interest in writing seems to have prevented his giving his whole attention to his duties, and in January 1829 he returned to England.<br>
<br>In June of that year Kitto became a member of a private mission party organized by Groves, and in company with him and others sailed for Persia; an interesting account of the journey appears in his journals. The party reached Baghdad in December, and Kitto, besides acting as tutor to Groves's children, opened an Armenian school. A terrible plague destroyed some 50,000 of the inhabitants of Baghdad in little more than a month, and carried off five out of thirteen inmates of Groves's house. A flood and a siege by Ali Pasha of Aleppo followed; the schools were broken up, and in September 1832 Kitto left Baghdad. On reaching England, after a journey of nine months, he obtained an introduction to the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and was engaged to write for the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>, in which the &#145;Deaf traveller&#146; and other papers of his appeared. He also at this time contributed to the <span class="italic">Companion to the Almanack</span>, the <span class="italic">Companion to the Newspaper</span>, the <span class="italic">Printing Machine</span>, and Charles Knight's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span>. On 21 September 1833 he married a Miss Fenwick; she and seven of their children survived him.<br>
<br>At the suggestion of Charles Knight Kitto began in 1834 a series of narratives illustrative of the life of blind, deaf, and mute people, later collected as <span class="italic">The Lost Senses</span> (1845); in 1835 he wrote a &#145;Biblical commentary&#146;, which resulted in <span class="italic">The Pictorial Bible</span>, originally published anonymously in monthly parts. It was completed in May 1838, and was well received (3 vols. octavo, and 4 vols. quarto, 1835&#150;8). The notes were afterwards published separately under the title <span class="italic">The Illustrated Commentary</span> (5 vols., 1840). He next agreed with Knight to write a <span class="italic">Pictorial History of Palestine and the Holy Land, Including a Complete History of the Jews</span>, which he completed after nearly three years of hard work (1840). <span class="italic">The Christian Traveller</span> was then planned, a work intended to give some account of missionary activities; but Knight ran out of money and only three parts of it appeared (1841). These were the most notable of the many illustrated biblical works which made Kitto a prominent, but never financially successful, author. Following Knight's failure, Kitto suffered much hardship. He had to sell his house at Islington and move to Woking. He wrote for Messrs A. and C. Black, Edinburgh, who published his <span class="italic">History of Palestine</span> (1843). He also began the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature</span>, on which he was at work until 1845 (2 vols., 1845). In 1844, though a layman, he received the degree of DD from the University of Giessen, and in 1845 was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1848 he began the <span class="italic">Journal of Sacred Literature</span>, which he edited until 1853. Financial difficulties continued to press upon him. The <span class="italic">Journal of Sacred Literature</span> did not pay the cost of printing, and he was obliged to leave Woking for a cheaper house at Camden Town. In 1849 he began the preparation of the <span class="italic">Daily Bible Illustrations</span> for Messrs Oliphant of Edinburgh, to be published in quarterly parts. Volume 1 appeared in December of that year, and the concluding volume in January 1854. He was given a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum in 1850 in recognition of his &#145;useful and meritorious literary works&#146;. His health, never robust, began seriously to fail in 1851. In August 1854 he went to Germany to try the effect of mineral waters, but on 25 November 1854 died at Cannstadt, where he had settled. His remains were buried in the cemetery there, a tombstone being erected over them by Mr Oliphant, his publisher.<br>
