<span class="headword">Woddis,  Roger <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Nehemiah Salem]</span></span>  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">poet and satirist</span>, was born on 18 May 1917 at 112 Addison Way, Golders Green, north London, the son of Moses Jacob Woddis, a Polish Jew and an English teacher, and his wife, Leah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marcus.<br>
<br>Woddis was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, and intended to become a doctor; he changed his name during his schooldays, adopting Roger in place of his given forenames. His father introduced him to Ibsen, Tolstoy, and Strindberg, and took him for long walks in the countryside north of London, while they recited poetry to each other.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Woddis joined the Unity Theatre, a left-wing company, and the Communist Party. In the former he acted and fancied himself as a playwright in rhyming couplets, a dramatic form for which there was little demand. He left the Communist Party after the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Woddis served in an army plastic surgery field ambulance in north Africa and Italy. After the war he took the civil service exam, and was set to take a job with HM customs (appropriately enough dealing with bonded warehouses). But he resolved to make his living as a writer.<br>
<br>Woddis worked first for the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, on its satirical back page entitled (characteristically) &#145;Tell me if it hurts&#146;. The satire boom of the 1960s brought him to wider notice. He contributed to BBC television's <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span>, and coined David Frost's catchphrase: &#145;But seriously, they're doing a grand job.&#146; He married Joan Elizabeth Hobson (<i>b</i>. 1928), a teacher, on 21 November 1953. They had a son and a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1975, but the couple remained close.<br>
<br>In 1970 Dick Crossman was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, and determined to discover a successor to Sagittarius and Reginald Reynolds, each of whom had contributed weekly satiric verses to the magazine. Crossman had only to glance at the results of the literary competitions at the back of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> to find his people's Juvenal. Woddis was a regular competitor, finalist, and winner. And so for the next quarter of a century almost without a break Woddis delivered his weekly witty satire. It usually made a barbed political point, sometimes a coarse one (Woddis delighted in sexual imagery).<br>
<br>In his day he hit the bull's-eye of humbug and punctured the pretensions of cabinet ministers during the Thatcher years. He was equally savage about Americans. Woddis retained a fundamental anti-Americanism from his days in the Communist Party, and waffle from successive American presidents often gave him his target. He enjoyed the teamwork of creative collaboration. This suited his lifelong socialist principles, and he saw himself as one of a William Morris brotherhood of poets, parodists, and journalists. He considered himself a popular entertainer, because he did not write &#145;long, torpid tomes&#146;. Kingsley Amis described him as a &#145;virtuoso parodist who is also a true and original poet&#146;.<br>
<br>At one stage Woddis was contributing his sharp rhyming commentaries on the week's news simultaneously to <span class="italic">Punch</span> and the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span> as well as the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. And although he was a master of pastiche, he never plagiarized or repeated himself. His command of metre, rhythm, and style ensured that his verse seldom lapsed into doggerel. He said: &#145;People ask me how I find time to do all this stuff. But I think I'm lazy. If I weren't I would have written <span class="italic">War and Peace</span> or <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span>&#146;.<br>
<br>Lazy Woddis was not, but a professional journalist in an ancient genre of the inky trade. He needed the spur of a deadline. He habitually rose at 5.30 a.m. to start work. When he became a national institution for his verses, he branched out into television. He wrote for the cult series <span class="italic">The Prisoner</span>. In 1971 he wrote a play, <span class="italic">Sherlock Holmes Investigates</span>, for the Victoria Theatre, Stoke-on-Trent. In his spare time he wrote and published serious poetry. His collected works were published in 1984&#150;5.<br>
<br>A sociable and charming man, Woddis lived in a small flat in Palmers Green, north London. It was filled with newspapers. He described his interests as &#145;music, cigarettes, women and whisky&#146;. Roger Woddis was small (5 feet 6 inches tall), with a ginger, silvered beard, and dapper in an arty way. He was not flashy or smart like a City gent, but he took trouble with his appearance and dress. During his last illness from cancer he was nursed by his former wife. He told his family that he would like his epitaph to be: &#145;He always met his deadline.&#146; He died on 16 July 1993 at Whittington Hospital, Islington, and was cremated.<br>
