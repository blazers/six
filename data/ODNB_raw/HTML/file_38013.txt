<span class="headword">Stoakes <span class="st"> [Stokes]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1665), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was a native of Plymouth, which remained his home. Bred up to the sea, he probably commanded merchant vessels before entering the Commonwealth navy. He first appears as captain of the <i>Hector</i> in the spring of 1649, serving in the western approaches, and helped to transport the Cromwellian army to Ireland later that year. He continued in the western station, commanding the <i>Dragon</i> in 1650&#150;52 with considerable success. He carried the royalist frigate <i>Grenvile</i> into Plymouth in February 1652, and in September captured a Swedish vessel with a rich cargo of gold bullion, which was transported under armed guard from Plymouth to the Tower. Stoakes's rise to prominence came with the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652&#150;4), during which he took part in the actions off the Kentish Knock and Dungeness late in 1652 and in the three great sea battles of 1653, in the second of which he was wounded. He was advanced to more senior commands, and during the final winter served as rear-admiral of the blue in the Channel Fleet.<br>
<br>In August 1654 Stoakes sailed as flag captain to Robert Blake in the <i>George</i> in the expedition to the Mediterranean; he took part in the attack on Porto Farina, and was advanced to rear-admiral from 1 September 1655 on Joseph Jordan's return to England, succeeding him in command of the <i>Unicorn</i>. The expedition returned to England early in October. Stoakes sailed again with Blake and Edward Mountagu in March 1656 on the expedition to Spain, commanding the <i>Rainbow</i>. After returning to England in November he rejoined the fleet in February 1657, and commanded the squadron blockading the coast in April 1657 when Blake took the rest of the fleet to attack the plate fleet at Santa Cruz. When Blake sailed for England in July Stoakes stayed on to command the English squadron remaining on station, transferring to the <i>Lyme</i>. At the end of the year he led his squadron through the Strait of Gibraltar and on to Leghorn, where he angered the duke of Tuscany by stopping and searching vessels entering and leaving the port; unperturbed, Stoakes wrote home complaining of the duke's &#145;impertinences&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thurloe</span>, 7.75), and found his actions approved. He then sailed for Tunis, arriving off the port on 28 January and calling on the dey to free his English captives. Both parties recognized, however, that with only six ships Stoakes could not hope to emulate Blake's attack on Porto Farina, and he was obliged to ransom the captives as part of a general treaty of peace and friendship. He secured the release of seventy-two English slaves, including three women, for a third of the sum originally demanded. A similar treaty with Tripoli, negotiated in the summer, was well received in England.<br>
<br>Stoakes's operations against Spanish shipping were hampered by a long and bitter feud with his deputy, Thomas Whetstone, the protector's nephew. A rash young man promoted on the strength of his connections, Whetstone openly flouted the admiral's authority, and Stoakes eventually arrested him in September 1658 and sent him back to England for trial. The squadron itself was summoned home in May 1659, reaching England in September. Stoakes was relieved to find his conduct fully approved.<br>
<br>In November 1659 Stoakes was one of the naval officers ashore who wrote urging Monck to accept the army's coup against the restored Rump Parliament. Despite this he was given a new command by the reinstated Rump in March 1660, probably because Mountagu, now commanding the fleet once more, judged him an officer too important to exclude. He played no part in Mountagu's manoeuvring to restore the monarchy, and Mountagu neither liked nor trusted him. None the less Stoakes made no overt protest, and sailed with the fleet that brought the king home in May.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1660 Stoakes was made second in command of an expedition to Guinea, led by the fiery cavalier Robert Holmes, to support and protect the interests of the Royal African Company. That may suggest earlier trading connections with the region, or simply that the new regime wanted him at a safe distance. There was an inauspicious beginning when his ship, the <i>Amity</i>, foundered at Woolwich during a sudden storm on 9&#150;10 December, before the expedition was ready to depart, and he commanded the <i>Assurance</i> in her stead. Relations became strained between the two commanders; Holmes scorned his &#145;old, fat&#146; deputy and &#145;would have been well contented to have seen him hanged&#146;  (Ollard, 67&#150;8). The small English force attacked several Dutch forts in the Gambia, and arrived back in England in July 1661 with ivory but none of the gold they had been hoping to find. Stoakes, now in the <i>Marmaduke</i>, returned to Guinea in 1663, ahead of Holmes's second expedition, and his exploits in driving out the Dutch and erecting a warehouse and fort for English traders prompted a bitter complaint by the Dutch West India Company in September. The following spring his small force crossed the Atlantic to Barbados, probably carrying slaves, and on to Jamaica in June, bringing Sir Thomas Modyford to take up his post as governor and 700 settlers from Barbados.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, to which the exploits of Holmes and Stoakes had contributed, ensured that Dutch complaints were quickly forgotten. Stoakes was appointed captain of the <i>Triumph</i>, one of the most powerful ships in the fleet, but soon fell ill and died at Portsmouth, probably on board the <i>Triumph</i>, on 11 February 1665; he was presumably buried in either Portsmouth or Plymouth. Stoakes was a pugnacious and capable commander, and during the 1650s had won tributes from four of the generals-at-sea (Blake, Richard Deane, Monck, and Mountagu). Samuel Pepys enjoyed his company, and relished his tale of an African king who had invited him (and Holmes) to sleep with any of his hundred wives. In his will, drawn up in 1662, Stoakes described himself as &#145;gentleman&#146; and divided his estate equally between his wife, Katherine, and his married daughter, Katherine Heydon.<br>
