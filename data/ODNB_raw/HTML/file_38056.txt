<span class="headword">Thom,  Alexander</span>  (1894&#150;1985), <span class="occ">aerodynamicist and archaeologist</span>, was born on 26 March 1894 in Carradale Mains, Argyll, the elder son (there were no daughters) of Archibald Thom, farmer, and his wife, Lily Stevenson Strang of Glasgow. The family moved in 1901 to Dunlop, Ayrshire, where Thom went to school, afterwards attending Kilmarnock Academy, from about 1907. He studied civil engineering at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow and at the University of Glasgow (BSc 1915), where he won the George Harvey prize and also studied archaeology. In 1917 he married Jeanie Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1975), daughter of Allan Kirkwood, farmer. They had two sons and a daughter. The younger son, Alan, an aerodynamicist, was killed in a flying accident in 1945; the other, Archibald S. Thom, followed his father as a lecturer in engineering at Glasgow University.<br>
<br>After working as a structural engineering designer Thom was a draughtsman with aircraft firms before becoming a lecturer at the University of Glasgow in civil engineering and aeronautics (1922&#150;39). He built the first wind tunnel in Scotland and obtained his PhD in 1926 and DSc in 1929 from Glasgow University, both for theoretical and experimental studies of flow around cylinders in various configurations.<br>
<br>Thom worked throughout the Second World War at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, where he commissioned and ran the high-speed tunnel for testing early Spitfires. In 1945 Thom was elected professor of engineering science at Oxford and a fellow of Brasenose College. He took over a small department and greatly expanded it, his research centring on a method of calculation of flow problems. Initially he used a small mechanical calculator to solve each problem, a laborious process later rapidly accomplished by computer. He was an active member of the Aeronautical Research Committee for many years.<br>
<br>In parallel with his academic work Thom spent every summer accurately surveying megalithic sites on the west coast of Scotland, an activity which combined happily with his skill as a yachtsman. On his retirement in 1961 he returned to his home at Dunlop and devoted himself to analysis and further surveys of megalithic circles and aligned stones, from the Orkneys to as far south as the well-known Carnac site in Brittany, with over 2000 stones. The results of these labours over a period of fifty years were many papers and five influential books, the last two of which were completed by his son. These, particularly <span class="italic">Megalithic Sites in Britain</span> (1967), drew attention to the probable astronomical significance of the megalithic remains. By statistical analysis of his surveys he deduced that their builders had employed a common unit of measurement, the megalithic yard of 0.83m, not in simple circles but in circular arcs centred on right-angled triangles. Some sites he considered to be astronomical calendars, others lunar observatories, showing the scientific abilities of prehistoric man.<br>
<br>Thom's ideas remain contentious, and although he presented his theories fully supported by data and lucidly explained, their comprehension requires a knowledge of mathematics, statistics, surveying, astronomy, and archaeology&#151;not a common combination. However, he is regarded as the founder of the subject of &#145;archaeoastronomy&#146;. Thom's work was recognized by honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow (LLD, 1960) and Strathclyde (DSc, 1976). He was a member of the British Astronomical Association, and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London, and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Above all, Sandy Thom was esteemed by his colleagues; he was truly egregious, a kind man and a good skipper, whether of a yacht's crew, a survey party, or a department. Thom died in Belford Hospital, Fort William, on 7 November 1985.<br>
