<span class="headword">Waite,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1634&#150;1668), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was probably the eldest son of Henry Waite of Wymondham, Leicestershire. Thomas Waite was admitted to Gray's Inn on 5 March 1634, and may have been the Thomas Waite appointed king's receiver for the counties of Warwick and Leicester for 1640&#150;41. Waite sided with parliament at the outbreak of civil war. By spring 1643 he held a captaincy from Lord Grey of Groby and was stationed with Sir Edward Hartop at Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire. In December 1643 he raided royalist quarters at Waltham on the Wolds, Leicestershire, and defeated the royalists based at Belvoir Castle at Sproxton Heath in the same county. He was soon commissioned colonel of horse and governor of Rutland.<br>
<br>In July 1644, while serving as governor of Burghley House, Northamptonshire, Waite became involved in a dispute with Lord Grey; articles were framed by Rutland gentlemen to suspend him from his governorship, while counter-petitions were presented in his favour. On 11 August 1645 parliament discharged him from further attendance upon the case and he returned to Burghley. However, the dispute lingered and on 14 October the committee of both kingdoms feared that, with the king nearby, unrest within the garrison might undermine its strength. The dispute was revived on 27 November and Waite was called to attend the House of Commons again on 3 December. The case was still being heard in June 1646. Nevertheless Waite was elected county MP for Rutland in July 1646, and on 9 January 1647 the House of Commons ordered that &pound;2166 be paid him out of Rutland's delinquency fines.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1648 Waite was dispatched from Leicester by Lord Grey with a commission to proceed with martial law to quell a royalist uprising around Peterborough and Stamford. Pursuing the insurgents to Woodcroft House, Waite's forces stormed the building on 6 June and killed the royalist leader, Dr Michael Hudson, for which Waite received parliament's thanks on 8 June. At the end of August, under the command of Lord Grey, Waite participated in the pursuit and capture of the duke of Hamilton, relating the affair to the House of Commons on 28 August 1648. He was among the witnesses at Hamilton's subsequent trial, where Hugh Peter openly accused him of lying over whether Hamilton had surrendered to Grey's or John Lambert's forces. Although not personally excluded, he disapproved of Pride's Purge and withdrew from the House of Commons on 13 December 1648. He returned to his estates, and later alleged that he suppressed republican petitions there before the threat of sequestration compelled him to return to London on 25 January 1649. Named to the high court of justice, he attended only three meetings, but was among the last of the signatories of the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<br>
<br>On 5 March 1650 Waite was appointed commander-in-chief of the Rutland militia's cavalry, but three years later, with the dissolution of the Rump Parliament, he retired from state affairs, and endeavoured to recover his wartime losses. On 31 July 1650, with over &pound;400 still due to him, parliament had authorized his purchase of the duke of Buckingham's Rutland estates. On 13 March 1654 Waite's tenants at Hambleton petitioned the council of state complaining of Waite's doubling their rents, diverting their water supply, violating an earlier agreement by enclosing their commons, and endeavouring to evict eighty families.<br>
<br>Waite did not return to the House of Commons until 1659, and was excepted from the Restoration's <span class="roman">Act of General Pardon and Oblivion</span> on 9 June 1660. Four days later he obeyed the proclamation summoning the regicides to surrender themselves. He was brought to trial on 10 October 1660; pleading not guilty, he claimed that he had been tricked into attending court on 27 January 1649 by a note he thought had come from Lord Grey, but which had actually been sent by Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton. He claimed that he attended on 29 January only after he received assurances that the king would not be executed, and that Cromwell overpowered his objections, demanding &#145;These that are gone in shall set their hands, I will have their hands now&#146;  (Fraser, 287). Waite's absence from the house during much of December and January 1648&#150;9 supports the case that he was a reluctant regicide.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Waite was found guilty and condemned to death. However, on 28 August 1660, because he had surrendered, his name was included on the list of those whose execution was not to take place without a special act of parliament. An act to accomplish this was passed by the House of Commons in January 1662, and Waite was summoned to the bar of the House of Lords on 7 February 1662 to plead for his life. He pointed out, quite truthfully, that he had no part in establishing the high court, but his contention that he was &#145;forced by Cromwell to signe a writing not knowing what was conteyned therein&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 167) remains unconvincing. The act was eventually dropped and his life was consequently spared, but he spent the rest of his life in prison while his wife, Jane, unsuccessfully appealed for his release, pleading her own ill health and the burden of her five children. He remained a prisoner in Jersey, where he was ordered to be committed to the old castle on 13 February 1668. No will survives and the eventual date of his death is not known.<br>
