<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paddy, Sir  William</span>  (1554&#150;1634), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Middlesex, the first of the two children of Roger and Margery Paddy, merchants. His brother, Nicholas, died in 1602. William was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 15 January 1568 to 1570, then at St John's College, Oxford. After receiving his BA in July 1573, he travelled to the University of Leiden to study medicine and was awarded his MD on 21 July 1589. This was incorporated at Oxford on 22 October 1591. Shortly after receiving his MD Paddy returned to London and applied to the College of Physicians for a licence to practise physic. He was examined at the college on 23 December 1589 and unanimously approved for admission as a licentiate, and was sworn in on 8 May 1590. He became a fellow on 25 September 1591 and was a censor in 1595 and between 1597 and 1600; he became an elect in 1606, and was president of the college in 1609, 1610, 1611, and 1618. He became a consiliarius in 1624. Between 1596 and 1609 he was &#145;desector of Anathomies&#146; to the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company.<br>
<br>From 1594 to 1602 Paddy was physician to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. In 1603 he wrote verses lamenting Queen Elizabeth's death, and praising her successor. James I knighted Paddy on 9 July 1603, and appointed him his personal physician. Paddy was summoned in March 1625, when James I became acutely ill. James died two days later, and Paddy recorded the king's last solemn profession of faith in his copy of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, which is preserved in St John's College, Oxford. Paddy was MP for Thetford, Norfolk, from 1604 to 1611, and was a member of the privy council from 1609 to 1610. On 7 April 1620, with his colleague and friend Matthew Gwinne and several merchants, grocers, and apothecaries, he was commissioned to set down ordinances, orders, and directions to regulate the quality and sale of tobacco.<br>
<br>As one of the most prominent physicians of his time, Paddy was a vocal proponent of learned medicine and firmly defended the privileges of the College of Physicians. In 1614 he was appointed to plead the immunity of the members of the college from bearing arms before the lord mayor, Sir Thomas Middleton, and the recorder, Sir Henry Montagu. He spoke before the court on 4 October, and pointed out the nature of the acts 14 and 32 Henry VIII, which set out the privileges of physicians. The recorder decided in favour of the claim of the college. Later that year Paddy and Edward Lister were sent to the bishop of London, John King, to plead for the suppression of Helkiah Crooke's treatise on anatomy. The physicians argued that parts of it were obscene and that no such work should be printed in English. Paddy and Lister succeeded in ensuring that the final two sections of the book were corrected by members of the college, and the work was published, as <span class="italic">Mikrokosmographia: a description of the body of man</span>, in 1615. In February of that year Paddy spoke against the proposals of Henry Atkins for the separation of the apothecaries' professional association from that of the grocers. When the midwives of London petitioned the king in 1615 for a charter for incorporation, regulation, and education, the College of Physicians was consulted, and Paddy proposed an alternative scheme. In May 1624 he again opposed innovations, this time by the surgeons, which potentially infringed the territory of the physicians. Though Paddy's medical ideas were thoroughly Galenic, his 1592 communications with Joannes Heurnius in Leiden show signs of a less rigid adherence to classical medical ideas.<br>
<br>Although Paddy did not publish anything in the field of medical politics, many of his friends and colleagues did. He supported Matthew Gwinne's attack on the chemical physician Francis Anthony, and contributed commendatory verses to Gwinne's <span class="italic">In assertorem chymicae, sed verae medicinae desertorem, Fra. Anthonium, Mattaei Gwynn adversaria</span> (1611), as he had earlier done for his play, <span class="italic">Vertumnus sive annus recurrens Oxonii &hellip;</span> (1607). Paddy also contributed verses to another work aimed against Anthony, Thomas Rawlin's <span class="italic">Admonitio pseudo-chymicis</span> (1610?). Many years before, Paddy had written in support of the <span class="italic">Sphaera civitatis</span> (1588) of the Aristotelian scholar John Case. In 1619, as president of the College of Physicians, Paddy drafted a preface for its pharmacopoeia. Paddy's power and prestige are signalled by the fact that Michael Maier's <span class="italic">Arcana arcanissima</span> (1614?), Robert Fludd's <span class="italic">Medicina catholica</span> (1629), and Raphael Thorius's <span class="italic">Hymnus tabaci</span> (1626) were all dedicated to him. Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne praised Paddy in the preface to his edition of Thomas Moffett's <span class="italic">Insectorum &hellip; theatrum</span> (1634). Paddy was also a friend of William Laud, and on one occasion defended him when he was ostracized after delivering an offensive sermon at Oxford.<br>
<br>Little is known about Paddy aside from his contributions to St John's College, Oxford, and the College of Physicians. However, it is recounted that at the age of fifty-five the eminent physician and one of his female patients were caught with their clothes off  (Pady, 74). Paddy had a son, William (1600&#150;1658), perhaps the product of a brief marriage. Paddy died in London on 3 December 1634, and was buried in the chapel of St John's College, Oxford. He left nearly everything to St John's College; this was in addition to his gift in 1602 of 1123 works in 682 volumes. His bequest included an organ, &pound;1800 for the improvement of the choir, and &pound;1000 towards the commons. After his father's death William Paddy travelled to America, where he became a prominent citizen in Plymouth and Boston.<br>
