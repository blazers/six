<span class="headword">Cooke <span class="st"> [Cook]</span>,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Linen Cooke]</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1726), <span class="occ">vegetarian and author</span>, the elder son of Robert Cooke, came of a family that settled in co. Cork in the early seventeenth century and prospered in the linen and other trades, particularly in Cork city and the town of Youghal. Reliable information on Cooke's genealogy and life is virtually limited to two sources: a biographical entry in <span class="italic">The Antient and Present State of &hellip; Waterford</span> (Dublin, 1746), whose author, the Dungarvan pharmacist Charles Smith, presumably knew Cooke at least by reputation; and a brief article in the magazine <span class="italic">The Patrician</span> for 1847 based on information supplied by a descendant of Cooke's brother William.<br>
<br>Cooke's grandfather Peter Cooke&#151;allegedly of Norfolk origin&#151;was the first of his family to settle in co. Cork. His eldest son, Thomas, was father of another Thomas, an active Quaker, who died in 1706 having made a fortune in the linen trade which enabled him to acquire much land, including Dungallane near Kilworth: renamed Castle Cooke, it was the seat of the Cooke-Collis family down to 1921. Peter's second son, Robert Cooke, who served as an officer in the cavalry regiment raised among the protestant settlers of Munster by Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, settled at Cappoquin, co. Waterford. Robert Cooke, later known as Linen Cooke, was his elder son. The younger son, William Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1742) of Camphire, was mayor of Youghal in 1708 and married a niece of the faith healer Valentine Greatrakes, &#145;the Stroker&#146;.<br>
<br>Cooke inherited Cappoquin from his father but fled to England with many other protestant settlers upon the Catholic take-over of Ireland in 1689 and was among those outlawed as absentees by the Irish parliament of James II. He lived for a time at Ipswich, Suffolk, but returned to Ireland after the Williamite victory of 1691. He was twice married: his first wife was a woman of Bristol (a port with which he had commercial links); his second wife, Cicely, with whom he had three sons&#151;John (of Youghal), Robert, and Josiah&#151;and two daughters, appears to have survived him.<br>
<br>Like his cousin Thomas, Robert Cooke was a member of the Society of Friends, but he left it to pursue his own solitary quest for a relationship with the Almighty. In 1691 he published a pamphlet or broadside (partially reproduced by Smith) in which he explained his vegetarian and theological opinions. &#145;I am a Christian and a Protestant&#146;, he declared:<blockquote>and my Religion is to fear God and to keep his Commandments, to keep my soul undefiled from the worldly evil nature. I abhor the evil and love the good and have fellowship therein with all in every sect or gathered or scattered people. (Smith, 372)</blockquote>In 1695 he was in correspondence with the Dublin merchant and Quaker Anthony Sharp.<br>
<br>Smith states that Cooke would &#145;neither eat fish, flesh, butter, &amp;c., nor drank any fermented liquor, nor wore woollen cloaths, or any other produce of an animal&#146;  (Smith, 371) and relates anecdotes of his eccentricity. Cooke chose white cows rather than black and always had his coach drawn by white horses. On one occasion his servants caught a fox which had killed some of his poultry: Cooke assembled his employees and tenants, and having delivered a lengthy harangue on the fox's crime, ordered it to run the gauntlet of rods before letting it go. In his pamphlet Cooke declared that killing an animal would have done violence to his conscience, &#145;that innocent life in me&#146;, while he preferred &#145;water for drink and pulse (viz.) corn (and other vegitives) for food, and linen and other vegitives for rayment&#146; as &#145;cleanest and wholesomest, and warm, and strengthening, and nourishing, and healthful&#146;  (ibid., 374). Cooke died at Cappoquin Castle about 1726, aged &#145;upwards of four score&#146;  (Smith, 374). In his will he directed that he should be buried with the family of his son John &#145;in the cathedral or church called <i>tempul</i> in Youghal&#146; and stipulated, perhaps unnecessarily, that his shroud be made of linen  (&#145;Fragments of family history&#146;).<br>
