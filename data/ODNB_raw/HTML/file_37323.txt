<span class="headword">Cristall,  Ann Batten</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1769, <em>d.</em> 1848), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Penzance and baptized there on 7 December 1769, the elder daughter and second of the four children of Alexander Cristall (1718/19&#150;1802) of Monifieth, near Dundee, in Scotland, a mariner and later maker of sails, masts, and blocks with yards at Fowey and Penzance in Cornwall and later at Rotherhithe, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1745&#150;1801), the daughter of John Batten, a Penzance merchant. Alexander Cristall already had two sons by the time of his second marriage. When Ann was young, the family moved to London and later to Blackheath. Alexander Cristall apparently had a jealous disposition and family life was unpleasant when he was ashore. He also had a &#145;dread of the arts&#146;, but his wife was a &#145;woman of education and taste&#146;  (Roget, 179); she paid school fees from a small independent income of her own and appears to have had a significant influence on the artistic development of her children. Much of what is known about Ann Cristall's life is due to the modest fame enjoyed by her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6710/', "Joshua Cristall (bap. 1768, d. 1847)")</script>, who became a founder member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1804, although he seems to have suffered financial difficulties all his life. Ann and Joshua were very close. They &#145;studied together as children, and hand in hand did they daily walk to London and back for their schooling when the family lived at Rotherhithe&#146;  (ibid., 179).<br>
<br>Ann Cristall evidently became a schoolteacher but seems, to some extent, to have been financially dependent on Joshua. By the late 1780s she had become a friend of Mary Wollstonecraft and her sister Everina, and there are several references to her in Wollstonecraft's correspondence. In March 1790, Wollstonecraft wrote to Joshua: &#145;I know that you earnestly wish to be the friend and protector of your amiable sister and hope no inconsiderate act or thoughtless mode of conduct will add to her cares&#151;for her comfort very much depends on you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 188). Elsewhere, Wollstonecraft refers to Ann's &#145;tender affectionate heart&#146;  (ibid., 196), and in a letter to Joshua dated 9 December 1790 wrote: &#145;I fear her situation is very uncomfortable. I wish she could obtain a little more strength of mind. I am afraid she gives way to her feelings more than she ought to&#146;  (Roget, 184).<br>
<br>In 1795 Ann Cristall's <span class="italic">Poetical Sketches</span>, published by Joseph Johnson, appeared. Subscribers included both Wollstonecrafts, Anna Letitia Barbauld, John Aikin, Amelia Alderson (later Opie), Samuel Rogers, Mary Hays, and George Dyer, suggesting a fairly distinguished circle of intellectual acquaintances. The poems were often melancholic pieces and mostly concerned with nature. Contemporary reviewers criticized her technical imperfections but praised her &#145;genius, and Warmth of imagination&#146;  (P. Feldman, ed., <span class="italic">British Women Poets of the Romantic Era: an Anthology</span>, 1997, 214). The poet George Dyer became a close friend, and in a letter to Mary Hays suggested a collaborative effort&#151;a &#145;<i>poetical novel</i>&#146;&#151;between the two female writers. He praised Ann Cristall's &#145;very fine talent for poetry: one or two of her songs are, I think, as beautiful as any I know&#146;  (Wedd, 238&#150;9). In 1797 she was introduced to Robert Southey, who declared in a letter to Joseph Cottle, dated 13 March 1797: &#145;the literary circles say she has no genius; but she has genius, Joseph, or there is no truth in physiognomy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 1.306). In May 1799 Southey wrote that Dyer had promised him a piece by Ann Cristall for his <span class="italic">Annual Anthology</span> (1799&#150;1800), but she appears not to have contributed.<br>
<br>Very little is known about Ann Cristall's later life, and she appears to have dropped out of intellectual circles after the 1790s. She seems not to have married and is listed under her own name in <span class="italic">A Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1816). In 1841 Joshua Cristall returned to London, where his household consisted of &#145;two lady wards, between whom and himself there existed a strong attachment&#146;  (Finch, 67), these being Mary Cox and Sarah Woore, former students of his wife. Towards the end of her life Ann may have lived with her younger sister, Elizabeth, as an assistant at Lewisham Hill grammar school, Kent. Ann's death, which came less than four months after that of her brother, occurred on 9 February 1848, and is recorded by a memorial inscription at St Mary's Church, Lewisham, Kent; where she was buried in 15 February.<br>
