<span class="headword">Throckmorton <span class="st"> [Throgmorton]</span>,  Michael</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">agent for Cardinal Reginald Pole</span>, was a son (perhaps the youngest) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63916/', "Sir Robert Throgmorton or Throckmorton (c.1451&#150;1518)")</script> of Coughton, Warwickshire, and Katherine, daughter of William Marrow or Marrowe of London. The family was well connected and Michael's elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38067/', "Sir George Throckmorton (c.1489&#150;1552)")</script> often sat in parliament. Michael Throckmorton was a cousin of William Peto and of Queen Katherine Parr. Although he may have enjoyed Cardinal Wolsey's patronage along with John Helyar, nothing certain is known of him before he appears in Padua in 1533 as a student of law; he was in Venice two years later, perhaps already in Reginald Pole's service. He may have carried Pole's <span class="italic">Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione</span> to Henry in 1536 and was certainly in service with Pole in 1537. Thomas Cromwell tried to capitalize on his position and use him as a spy on Pole. Throckmorton, however, either deliberately manipulated Cromwell, or came to believe that Pole was right in his controversy with Henry; and when Cromwell discovered this in mid-1537, the minister threatened Throckmorton's family with ruin. Meanwhile, Throckmorton had played a key role in Pole's legation of 1537 intended to aid the Pilgrimage of Grace; his special remit seems to have been Pole's personal safety.<br>
<br>At the reorganization of the English Hospice in Rome in 1538 Michael Throckmorton was among its members, the following year serving as auditor when he was identified as Pole's secretary. On 19 May 1539 he was attainted, second on a list beginning with Pole. He appears regularly in the hospice's records as auditor until 1551, but only once as <i>camerarius</i> (&#145;chamberlain&#146;). He accompanied Pole to Viterbo, and during at least some of the 1540s probably also served as his agent in Rome. At the end of the decade Throckmorton along with Richard Hilliard acted as intermediaries between Protector Somerset and Pole, and they may actually have gone to England in 1549; at least a passport for them was issued on 15 February 1549. In 1551 Peter Vannes described Throckmorton as Pole's principal servant. To Throckmorton fell the honour of carrying to Queen Mary in 1553 Pole's bull of appointment as legate to England. He left Maguzzano on 28 August. There were difficulties over his admission to the country, but he seems finally to have secured entry and thereafter to have shuttled back and forth to Pole throughout the first nine months of 1554. In return for services rendered, Mary I granted him a pardon and restored the family manor of Coughton (which was then conveyed to a cousin). Throckmorton apparently did not accompany Pole to England, instead going to Mantua where he seems to have remained for the rest of his life. This move may have been planned by Pole, who relied heavily on Mantuan agents in his diplomatic manoeuvres and on the support of the regent Cardinal Gonzaga. The fact that Throckmorton continued to identify Pole as his master supports this supposition. Then again, Throckmorton had married Agnes Hyde in Mantua, probably in 1553 when the papal licence for the ceremony identified him as living in the Roman curia. After his death he was described as having lived in Mantua &#145;for many years&#146;  (Archivio di Stato, Mantua, &#145;Registrationi notarili anno 1558&#146;, fols. 94<i>v</i>&#150;97<i>v</i>). Once Throckmorton reached Mantua (before June 1555), he assisted the voluntary exile to Italy Edward Courtenay, lending him money and inviting him to visit. They certainly met in Verona. In 1557 Luigi Schiffanoia forwarded an English report of the victory of St Quentin, suggesting that the duke's secretary have &#145;our&#146; Throckmorton translate it  (Archivio di stato, Mantua, Archivio Gonzaga, b. 578, Inviati Inghilterra/Scozia, fols. 169<i>r</i>&#150;170<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Throckmorton has been incorrectly identified as the author of or translator responsible for <span class="italic">A copye of a very fyne and wytty letter sent from the ryght reverende Lewes Lippomanus byshop of Verona in Italy</span>, apparently identical copies of which were published in Emden and London in 1556. The book is really a protestant satire as Throckmorton's identification on the title page as &#145;Curtigiane of Rome&#146; indicates, together with the dedication to Pole accusing him of &#145;propping up prelacy&#146; and trying to seduce the English nobility. Throckmorton is supposed to have died on 1 November 1558, leaving in Mantua a son, Francis, from a previous, undocumented, marriage. A herald's visitation of 1619 incorrectly recorded Michael Throckmorton and a brother killed at Pavia in 1525.<br>
