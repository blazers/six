<span class="headword">Tassie,  William</span>  (1777&#150;1860), <span class="occ">modeller</span>, born in London, was probably the son of David Tassie (<i>bap</i>. 1750), youngest brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26977/', "James Tassie (1735&#150;1799)")</script>, the modeller whom he assisted in the production of portrait medallions and casts of antique jewels. Aged twenty-one he produced a copy of his uncle's medallion of Lord Duncan to exhibit at the Royal Academy. Following his uncle's death in 1799 he took over the business at 20 Leicester Square. The change was advertised in Edinburgh, where Tassie &#145;respectfully informs the Pupils and Friends of his late uncle&#146; that he has:<blockquote>executed Medals of several of the Scotch Kings [of which] he has sent specimens, in paste enamel, to Marshall &amp; Sons, High Street, Edinburgh, where they may be seen; who will receive orders for them and also for portraits modelled by the late Mr Tassie. (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span>, 27 July 1799)</blockquote>Later he was assisted by William Hardy Vernon (1795&#150;1880), son of his sister Anne Tassie and James Vernon, who modelled intaglios of Milton and of Byron. Vernon matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1824 and died vicar of Wootton, Bedfordshire.<br>
<br>Tassie's shop had a counter running its full length, behind which were rows of drawers containing antique gem casts; in the window, covered by a glass dome, stood his uncle's replica of the Portland vase. The studio was a salon for artists and literary men, including Moore and Byron. Tassie was a kindly, cultivated man who loved to feed birds at the back of his house, until developers built over the ground and shot them. Out of kindness he bought a &pound;1 ticket for the Boydell lottery from a struggling artist; on 28 January 1805 he won the chief prize&#151;the Shakspeare Gallery in Pall Mall, pictures, and estate. Tassie made a present to the artist and sold the whole property by auction in May 1805, when the works of art realized more than &pound;6180.<br>
<br>Tassie added to his uncle's collection of reproductions of gems and medals; he supplied additional casts to the imperial collection of Russia. His most popular products were seals and gems in composition paste, inscribed with original mottoes and devices, of which he published a descriptive catalogue in 1816 (2nd edn, 1820) and 1830. His collection of intaglio and cameo impressions in enamel, sulphur, or paste finally consisted of more than 20,000 specimens; among them were many originals of contemporary notables, including Napoleon, Nelson, and Lady Hamilton, by artists employed by him. In 1822 Shelley instructed Thomas Love Peacock to procure for him &#145;two pounds worth of Tassie's gems&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Tassie also modelled portrait medallions in wax and cast them in the white enamel paste used by James Tassie, but his work did not have the ease and precision of his uncle's. He executed a set of twelve medallions of the passions, signed &#145;W. T.&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1840 Tassie retired from his prosperous business, which was continued by his partner John Wilson, an artist who had entered his employment about 1827 and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1824 to 1856. Tassie moved to 8 Upper Phillimore Place, Kensington, where he died, unmarried, on 26 October 1860; he was buried in Brompton cemetery. He left most of his estate to his nephew the Revd William Hardy Vernon and his great-nephew the Revd William Tassie Vernon. In two codicils he left a detailed bequest to the National Galleries of Scotland of portraits of his uncle and aunt by David Allan, a landscape by Nicholas Poussin, and an extensive collection of portrait medallions and casts of gems, giving as complete a collection as possible of the work of his uncle and himself. Those gems that he felt were &#145;licentious&#146; were omitted, and these he destroyed. A portion of the collection was left to his nephew, and part of this was sold at Wootton in February 1881, the remainder at Christies in April 1882; many of the large Tassie medallions were included in the Shadford Walker sale in 1889.<br>
