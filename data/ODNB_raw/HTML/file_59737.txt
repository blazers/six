<span class="headword">MacAlister, Sir  John Young Walker</span>  (1856&#150;1925), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born on 10 May 1856 in Perth, the second of the surviving three sons and three daughters of Donald MacAlister (1825&#150;1881), publisher's agent, and his wife, Euphemia Kennedy (<i>fl</i>. 1826&#150;1905). Educated at Liverpool high school, MacAlister gave up his medical studies at Edinburgh University because of pulmonary tuberculosis, or phthisis, which dogged his life and work. However, though plans for a medical career were abandoned, this time was productive. MacAlister's medical knowledge became useful in his career as a librarian and it was at Edinburgh that he met and, on 7 January 1875, married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1854/5), daughter of George Batley, an architect; they had two sons, Donald and Ian. According to the marriage certificate, MacAlister was then employed as a commercial traveller.<br>
<br>MacAlister's professional career began in 1877 with his appointment as sub-librarian at Liverpool Library. He became librarian of Leeds Library in 1880. A move to London in 1887 was significant for his career, for librarianship, and for medicine. He applied successfully for the new post of librarian at the Gladstone Library of the National Liberal Club. On arrival in London he found he had also been successful in another application for a much better-paid post: librarian to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. The Gladstone Library released him to accept the latter position, but MacAlister nevertheless worked for six months on a voluntary basis to organize its library.<br>
<br>Once established at the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, MacAlister began to make an impression on the wider library community. At the Library Association's conference in 1887 he gave a much discussed paper on the nature of librarianship. Tapping into fears about the status of the emerging profession and the tendency of committees to award senior posts to those without experience of librarianship, the paper caused him to be proclaimed &#145;a leader&#146;  (Godbolt and Munford, 28), a voice for the profession when one was sorely needed. The same conference elected him its joint honorary secretary, and between 1890 and 1898 he occupied the post alone. As honorary secretary he was involved in many consequential projects. In 1889 MacAlister edited (he later also published) the new Library Association journal <span class="italic">The Library</span>, which debated practical library management as well as literary issues and made its editor well-known among librarians. The journal discussed the contentious subject of public libraries and open access, and in 1895 this led to MacAlister's being a co-defendant in a libel case brought successfully by the indicator-advocate Charles Goss. The determination to develop librarianship demonstrated in his role as editor also prompted MacAlister to offer prizes to librarianship students and to support the establishment of the first library school at University College, London, in 1919.<br>
<br>The early 1890s saw MacAlister's involvement with library legislation which culminated in the 1892 <span class="roman">Public Libraries Act</span>. The act regularized aspects of public library provision and provided a clear definition of the term &#145;library authority&#146;. MacAlister performed one further outstanding service to librarianship by initiating plans for chartered status for the Library Association in 1895. After some difficulties the royal charter was granted in 1898, thus establishing a legal identity for the association. Rather belatedly MacAlister's work was acknowledged by the association with his election as vice-president, in 1905; he was also wartime president between 1915 and 1919.<br>
<br>MacAlister's powers of persuasion were also exercised on behalf of the medical community. His employer, the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, was one of many medical societies and MacAlister had long advocated amalgamation. These hopes were revived in 1905, with a plan backed first by Sir William Osler, regius professor of medicine at Oxford, and later by Sir William Church. A meeting at the Royal College of Physicians supported the idea of a single medical society, and MacAlister was instrumental in eventually establishing the Royal Society of Medicine in 1907 as a result of the amalgamation of fifteen societies.<br>
<br>Despite periodic ill health MacAlister injected a dose of &eacute;lan into the library profession and the medical societies. He initiated and invigorated projects in both arenas and yet has attracted little historical attention. Occasionally his extensive social acquaintances, cultivated through membership of the Savage and other London men's clubs, were drawn upon to augment his professional activities, such as during the second international library conference in London in 1897. Although <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> cites &#145;sleeping&#146; as his recreation, his other activities included establishing the University of London Press Ltd in 1910. During the First World War he was organizer for the Emergency Surgical Aid Corps for the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Metropolitan Police, and was honorary secretary of the surgical advisory committee to the War Office. He was knighted in 1919. MacAlister died from heart failure on 1 December 1925 at his home, 33 Finchley Road, London, a few months after resigning from the Royal Society of Medicine. His ashes were interred at Tarbert, Loch Fyne, Argyll, on 5 December.<br>
