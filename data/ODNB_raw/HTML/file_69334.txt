<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Joseph Harger</span>  (1859&#150;1936), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 21 January 1859 at Cross Hill, Greetland, near Halifax, Yorkshire, the youngest child of George Mitchell (1818&#150;1886), grocer and joiner, and his wife, Mary Harger, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holroyd. Both his paternal and his maternal ancestors hailed from Greetland, an industrial village, where Mitchell lived throughout his life. His family had strong Methodist roots and he attended the Greetland Wesleyan Chapel and Sunday school from an early age. He was educated at the Greetland Wesleyan day school before proceeding in 1871 to Heath grammar school, Halifax, where he gained many prizes and was appointed head boy in his final year. He inclined towards a legal career and passed the preliminary examination of the Incorporated Law Society, but then accepted a post on the staff of the Halifax Equitable Building Society in 1876, rising from junior clerk to managing director of the society. On 24 July 1884 at Greetland Wesleyan Chapel he married Harriet Shaw (<i>b</i>. 1859), the youngest daughter of Jacob Shaw, woollen weaver and mason, and Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Parr). They had two daughters and two sons, one of whom, George, a promising Halifax solicitor, was one of eleven young men from the chapel killed on active service in the First World War. His parents established an institute at the chapel in his memory in 1920.<br>
<br>Under Mitchell's leadership the Halifax Equitable Building Society, founded in 1871, expanded rapidly to become one of the largest building societies in the United Kingdom, second only in size and status to the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society, with which it merged in 1927. Mitchell worked at the head office of the society in Halifax and then managed branches at Elland, Greetland, and Stainland, before his appointment as secretary of the society in 1897. For the next twenty-five years &#145;his driving power, enthusiasm and untiring efforts&#146; as secretary led to an enormous expansion in business  (Alderson and Ogden, 24). At the end of his first year as secretary he was specially commended by the board of directors. In the five years following his appointment the society doubled the number of its customers to 3600. By 1914 the number of open accounts had more than trebled to 12,031. By 1921 it had nearly doubled again to 23,445, when the society's assets, which had stood at &pound;163,780 when Mitchell was appointed secretary, had reached &pound;3,126,302. Mitchell also established a reserve fund, which by 1921 amounted to &pound;50,000.<br>
<br>In 1898 Mitchell proposed the establishment of a bank to extend the financial services provided by the society to customers who wished to start small businesses or needed private banking accounts. The directors were initially sceptical and asked Mitchell if he could quote a precedent for his proposal. His reply was that &#145;it was for them to make precedents not simply to follow them&#146;  (Alderson and Ogden, 74). They eventually agreed to his proposal and the Halifax Equitable Bank commenced business on 1 January 1900, with an issue of 2000 &pound;1 shares. However, applications for shares exceeded the number issued by ten times and the initial allocation was raised to 2395. At the end of the first year the bank had accumulated assets of &pound;7921 and a dividend of 4 per cent was declared; by 1911 the assets totalled &pound;148,185 and the dividend was 10 per cent, and by the end of 1920 the assets had reached &pound;1,176,092 and the dividend was 16 per cent. Despite the misgivings of some directors that the bank, which was under the same management as the building society, might detract from the strength of the latter, by 1921 the Halifax Equitable Building Society was fourteen times as large as it was when the bank was founded. It had also acquired a network of fifty-five branches, forty of which were within a radius of 12 miles of Halifax. In 1908, in a speech to the Building Societies Association meeting in Halifax, Mitchell claimed that the amount invested in building societies in his district was forty times as great in proportion to population as the average for the whole country.<br>
<br>Mitchell was elected to the board of the society in 1920 and appointed managing director in 1921. His retirement from ill health in 1921 after over fifty years' &#145;devoted and distinguished service to the society&#146;  (Hobson, 83) provided the opportunity for the amalgamation of the Halifax Equitable with the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society, to become the largest building society in the world. On his retirement the combined assets of the Halifax Equitable Building Society and the Halifax Equitable Bank totalled nearly &pound;14 million, and the staff had increased from an assistant manager and a clerk to a workforce of a hundred.<br>
<br>Outside the business world Mitchell was well known for his work as a Methodist local preacher, temperance leader, politician, and educationist. The Greetland Wesleyan Sunday school and Young Men's Improvement Society had a formative influence on his youth and he subsequently taught in the Sunday school for nearly sixty years; preached in every nonconformist chapel pulpit in the district; and held every office open to a layman in his local Methodist circuit. A lifelong teetotaller, he was honorary secretary of the Halifax and District Band of Hope Union. He was also an advocate of a progressive educational system &#145;with well-staffed and well-equipped schools&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Daily Courier</span>, 5 March 1936) and served on the Halifax district technical instruction committee for eleven years; the Elland-cum-Greetland school board for eighteen years, including six years as chairman; and as the first chairman of the Greetland and Stainland education committee. In 1887 he was unanimously elected a member of the Greetland local board and held the seat until 1892. On the formation of the Greetland urban district council in 1894 he was elected at the head of the poll of twenty-one candidates and was subsequently appointed chairman of the council. Liberal in politics, he served as secretary of both the Greetland and West Vale Liberal Association from its formation in 1885 and the parliamentary division of Elland Liberal Association. He was also a founder member of the 1899 Club, a pioneering Yorkshire young Liberal association. He served as deputy registrar of marriages for the district and was chairman of the Greetland military service tribunal during the First World War. Finally, in 1923, he was appointed to the commission of the peace for the West Riding.<br>
<br>Photographs of Mitchell in 1921 reveal a smart-suited businessman with a strikingly healthy complexion, receding silvery hair, and a neatly trimmed beard and moustache. He died in the Duke of York Nursing Home, Duckworth Lane, Bradford, on 5 March 1936, of hypostatic pneumonia and a subacute intestinal obstruction. He was survived by his wife. His funeral service was held at Greetland Wesleyan Methodist Church on 9 March, followed by burial in the adjoining graveyard, where his maternal great-great-grandfather had been the first interment. The Revd Donald G. Brook in his eulogy observed that while Mitchell had &#145;made his way in the business world&#146; and had &#145;reached the heights&#146; by &#145;hard work and tenacity of purpose&#146;, he had &#145;ever kept in touch&#146; with the local community, and &#145;many people in lowly dwellings had reason to be grateful to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Daily Courier</span>, 9 March 1936).<br>
