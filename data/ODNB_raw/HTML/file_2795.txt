<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boleyn,  Thomas</span>, earl of Wiltshire and earl of Ormond  (1476/7&#150;1539), <span class="occ">courtier and nobleman</span>, was probably born at Blickling, Norfolk. The second son of Sir William Boleyn (<i>c</i>.1451&#150;1505), landowner, of Blickling, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1539/40), second daughter and coheir of Thomas Butler, seventh earl of Ormond (<i>c</i>.1424&#150;1515), he described himself as aged fifty-two in 1529. The MP James Boleyn (<i>c</i>.1480&#150;1561), was his younger brother. His grandfather Sir Geoffrey Boleyn had been lord mayor of London in 1457. In 1497, aged twenty, Thomas was in arms with his father against the Cornish rebels and in 1501 he attended the wedding of Prince Arthur and Katherine of Aragon. Two years later he accompanied Margaret Tudor to Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>By 1500 Boleyn had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1538), first daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13939/', "Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk (1443&#150;1524)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth. The couple had three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/557/', "Anne (c.1500&#150;1536), queen of England")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70719/', "Mary Stafford (c.1499&#150;1543)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2793/', "George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford (c.1504&#150;1536)")</script>. Eager for court advancement and expecting to inherit half the Ormond fortune, Boleyn had to exist on an annuity of &pound;50 and the occupancy of Hever Castle in Kent in the meantime. His father's death gave him a landed base in Norfolk as well as Kent&#151;he was sheriff of the latter county from 1510 to 1511 and from 1517 to 1518.<br>
<br>Already Henry VIII's squire of the body, Boleyn was made a knight of the Bath at the coronation of 23 June 1509. He was also appointed keeper of the exchange at Calais and the foreign exchange in England. In the early years of Henry's reign he was one of the sympathizers with the ambitions of the young warlike king against the more cautious counsel of Henry VII's bureaucrats. He also was a valued participant in royal entertainments, especially tournaments. He was the king's opponent at Greenwich Palace in May 1510 and among his answerers at the great Westminster Palace challenge of February 1511, appearing in the guise of a pilgrim from Santiago de Compostela. At Christmas 1514 he was involved in a fancy dress dance and indoor m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, and at Princess Mary's baptism on 20 February 1516 he was one of a select group holding the canopy. With his linguistic skills, his charm, and his knowledge of horses, hawks, and bowls, Boleyn made an ideal courtier.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticservice"></a>Diplomatic service</h2>Boleyn was of most service to the king as an outstanding diplomat, chosen as an English pioneer of the resident, rather than extraordinary, ambassador. A sophisticated and cultivated man, he was employed for his fluency in French. He spent a year from 1512 to 1513 with Dr John Young, Sir Richard Wingfield, and Sir Edward Poynings at the court of Margaret of Savoy, regent of the Low Countries, and on 5 April 1513 concluded an enlargement of the anti-French holy league to include the empire. Boleyn found favour with the regent as a quick and incisive negotiator, and won a courser from her by concluding the league negotiations within ten days. He joined in the invasion of France in summer 1513 with a retinue of 100 men.<br>
<br>From early 1519 Boleyn spent a year in France as resident ambassador to Fran&ccedil;ois I, arranging the interview at the Field of Cloth of Gold and discussing a marriage for Princess Mary. In June 1520 he returned to France to attend the Field of Cloth of Gold and Henry's subsequent meeting with Charles V at Gravelines. He was involved in the Franco-imperial conferences organized by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1521. In 1522 he was assigned to accompany the king to meet the emperor at Canterbury in May and in October was sent with Richard Sampson to Spain on a further mission promoting an offensive alliance against France, from which he returned in May 1523. Boleyn was one of ten English pensioners of Charles. On 18 June 1525 at Bridewell Palace he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Rochford. He went again to France in May 1527 as a commissioner with Sir Anthony Browne to receive Fran&ccedil;ois's oath to a new treaty with Henry, and was rewarded with a French pension. Back in England at the end of June, he assisted in discussions pursuing the project of Mary's French marriage. In 1530 Henry said that there was no skilled negotiator to equal him.<br>
<br>Henry's high opinion of Boleyn encouraged hopes of substantial reward. He promised him the comptrollership of the household, but during his French embassy in 1519 Wolsey informed him he would not have it, instead extending the prospect of the higher household office of treasurer on the anticipated ennoblement of Sir Edward Poynings. Boleyn, having enquired whether the cardinal perceived some fault in him, was ostensibly reassured. It has been debated whether he held a grudge against Wolsey from this point, but he was apparently comptroller in September 1520 and then, some time between October 1521 and April 1522, treasurer. Reliability was assumed by his presence on the special commission of 1521 that indicted Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham. Meanwhile, Henry also sought to induce Piers Butler, who claimed the earldom of Ormond as heir male, to surrender it to Boleyn. Boleyn's brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13940/', "Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey (1473&#150;1554)")</script>, then lord lieutenant of Ireland, suggested that the dispute could be resolved by marrying Butler's son to Anne Boleyn, but Butler probably baulked. Both Surrey and the king had to strike a balance, as Butler was useful and in fact succeeded Surrey as lord deputy.<h2>
<a name="ThekingsGreatMatter"></a>The king's Great Matter</h2>There is no doubt that Boleyn advanced in royal favour when he unleashed his precocious daughters, Mary and Anne, on Henry's court. In 1513 he had secured from Margaret of Savoy an invitation for Anne to join the schoolroom of her four wards, the grandchildren of Maximilian I. Anne wrote to him from Brussels professing her love and obedience and promising to become fluent in French. Next year the two girls went to the French court; Anne acted as interpreter for Henry's sister Mary Tudor and then remained for seven years in the household of Fran&ccedil;ois's queen, Claude, the most exclusive finishing-school for young ladies in Europe. By 1522 both of Boleyn's daughters were at the English court. Mary was soon the king's mistress, assisting Boleyn's elevation to the peerage as Viscount Rochford in 1525; he had already been made knight of the Garter (and was falsely reported a baron) in 1523. The ambitious father was, however, to benefit yet further when it looked as if Anne, maid of honour to Katherine of Aragon, might come to replace the queen.<br>
<br>There was a more intellectual side to Rochford the courtier, if one not unconnected to his ambitions. He read Latin and owned a printed copy of Martial's <span class="italic">Epigrams</span>. He employed a humanist scholar, Gerard Phrysius, who commissioned on his behalf from Desiderius Erasmus three works which established the Boleyn family's humanist and pietistic credentials: <span class="italic">Enarratio triplex in psalmum xxiii</span> (Basel, 1530), <span class="italic">Dilucida et pia explanatio symboli</span> (Basel, 1533), and <span class="italic">De praeparatione ad mortem</span> (Basel, 1534). The last ironically was used to fortify Katherine of Aragon on her deathbed, but her supporters criticized Erasmus for his dedications. In further partisan humanist patronage Rochford took up the Hebraist Robert Wakefield once he had abandoned his support for Katherine, and housed Thomas Cranmer and John Baker, a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, much engaged with the question of the royal divorce.<br>
<br>The imperial ambassador Eustache Chapuys claimed in 1531 that Anne and her father were more Lutheran than the Lutherans, and a year later he said both were considered true apostles of the new sect. Chapuys was probably concerned with their anti-clericalism, not with solifidian theology. John Foxe too was of the opinion that Wolsey feared the king's marriage to Anne as she and her family would exert their influence to abolish the whole power of the papacy.<br>
<br>The marriage of Henry and Anne initially seemed, not only to the king but also to Rochford, most likely to be brought about through Wolsey. However, once it was obvious that the cardinal was failing to make headway with Clement VII, Rochford's resentments and the increasing power of his family contributed to Wolsey's fall in June 1529. In 1527 it was reported to Wolsey that the king usually took supper with Surrey (now duke of Norfolk), Charles Brandon, first duke of Suffolk, and Rochford. Foreign ambassadors made clear that in the period just before and after Wolsey's dismissal Rochford, unlike the other two, was in constant attendance on the king. Jean du Bellay, the French ambassador, indeed accused him of seeking a monopoly of influence and of leading &#145;the dance against the dukes and Wolsey&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4, no. 2665). The newly arrived Chapuys too thought Rochford's influence was dominant; the viscount also participated in framing the parliamentary charges against the cardinal. Soon after Wolsey's death in November 1530 Rochford had a tasteless farce of the cardinal's descent into hell performed for the French ambassadors.<br>
<br>Rochford's profits included a grant of the revenues of the see of Durham and Durham House in London; it was now clear that he was one of Henry's small inner ring of councillors and that his daughter was Henry's intended queen. On 8 December 1529 he was promoted earl of Wiltshire and earl of Ormond. Piers Butler had been forced to resign the latter title, to which the Boleyn claim as representing only the younger of two sisters was hardly strong. On 24 January 1530 the new earl replaced Cuthbert Tunstall, bishop of Durham, as lord privy seal as part of a significant laicization of the great offices of state brought about by Henry's impatience with clerical restraint on his personal power. Following the example of Wolsey, Norfolk, and Suffolk, Wiltshire was named to every commission of the peace. Whitehall Palace was rebuilt for Anne, and in 1531 her father was allocated a set of rooms there.<br>
<br>Thanks to Anne, Wiltshire had risen faster than Sir William Fitzwilliam, another courtier&#150;diplomat who became earl of Southampton in 1537. Unlike Fitzwilliam, Wiltshire was still used as a diplomat after his promotion. Selected in 1530, with Cranmer, for a tour of Germany, Italy, and France to canvass academic opinion on Henry's divorce, he represented in his own person, being Anne's father, the king's commitment to the policy. Wiltshire also found Charles at Bologna, for his coronation by Clement, and raised the embarrassing question of Henry's divorcing his aunt. Reportedly, Charles told him &#145;that he was not to be believed in this case, as he was a party, and several other things&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4, no. 2827). According to Foxe, Wiltshire declined to pay the pope the accustomed reverence of kissing his toe&#151;an affront perhaps premature when diplomatic channels for the divorce had not yet been exhausted, but a testimony to the family's subsequent anti-clerical reputation. When Cranmer was appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 1533 the king told him he had Anne to thank.<h2>
<a name="Fatherofthequeenandfinalyears"></a>Father of the queen and final years</h2>Wiltshire naturally became an outspoken supporter of the divorce and the Henrician Reformation. In the parliament of 1532 he was one of the first to declare that neither pope nor prelate had the right to make laws and pursued his attack on ecclesiastical jurisdiction by visiting convocation with Norfolk to browbeat the clergy into submission after the supplication against the ordinaries. He canvassed for the bill in restraint of appeals (24 Hen. VIII c.12), reportedly hectoring Thomas Manners, first earl of Rutland, until he voted for it. In 1534 he was sent to Mary to seek an acknowledgement of her own illegitimacy, but without actually threatening her with death by proffering the oath of succession. On the death of Katherine of Aragon in January 1536 Wiltshire showed his self-seeking ruthless nature by remarking that it was a pity Mary had not died too. However, his and his daughter's influence was already being overshadowed by that of Thomas Cromwell. In 1534, for instance, the reliance of Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare, on Wiltshire to maintain him as lord deputy of Ireland&#151;both wanted to keep out Piers Butler&#151;was unavailing in the face of Cromwell's inclination to &#145;reform&#146; the government.<br>
<br>Once Anne fell in 1536 the whole Boleyn family followed. There is no evidence that Wiltshire tried to communicate with his daughter in the Tower of London; he was named to the commission of oyer and terminer to try several of her alleged lovers, Mark Smeaton, Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, and William Brereton. Anne and her brother George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, were executed in May; on 29 June their father lost the office of lord privy seal to Cromwell, agent of their fall, thus becoming the only nobleman dismissed from one of the great offices of state &#145;by the mature Henry VIII apart from those who were also condemned as traitors&#146;  (Miller, 178). He was removed from the commission of the peace even in his native Norfolk and retained only in Kent, and was forced to provide annuities from estates given him by the crown (as late as April 1536) for new favourites. Wiltshire attended Prince Edward's baptism on 15 October 1537, but this did not represent sufficient rehabilitation to end his troubles. Piers Butler reasserted himself, and by early 1538 he had been recognized as earl of Ormond. Wiltshire supposedly sought comfort in the claim that there might be two earls of Ormond as there were two lords Dacre in England. The countess of Wiltshire died at the London residence of Hugh Faringdon, abbot of Reading, on 3 April and was buried on 7 April 1538 in Lambeth church. Whether or not Wiltshire's own service as well as his daughter's rise had helped secure his remarkable gains, all but his English earldom (now without an heir) were irretrievably lost before he died at Hever Castle on 12 March 1539 and was buried in St Peter's Church there. A papal report of 1538 might well call him &#145;wise&#146; but &#145;of little power&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/2, no. 280). Cranmer stood by him in his last, broken years and attempted to untangle his affairs, but disputes over Wiltshire's estates continued until the archbishop's arrest in 1553.<br>
