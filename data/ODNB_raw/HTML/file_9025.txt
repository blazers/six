<span class="headword">Exmew,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1507&#150;1535), <span class="occ">Carthusian monk</span>, was apparently born in London about 1507, probably the son of Sir Thomas Exmew, goldsmith, alderman of London from 1506 onwards and lord mayor in 1517, the year in which he was also knighted. After Sir Thomas's death, on 6 February 1529, his stepson, John West, a friar observant at Greenwich, wrote to Cardinal Wolsey concerning the estate of his mother, Lady Elizabeth Exmew, who had died on 14 February in the previous year. Exmew apparently studied at Christ's College, Cambridge, though no degree is recorded. Maurice Chauncy, a fellow monk of the London Charterhouse, who greatly admired Exmew, attests his competence in both Latin and Greek. An Elizabeth Exmew, who may have been William Exmew's sister, a Dominican nun at Dartford, remained faithful to her vocation even after the suppression, dying in a Dominican convent near Bruges as late as 6 February 1585. In 1522 Sir John Thurston, goldsmith and alderman of London, left W. Exmew the substantial legacy of &pound;100.<br>
<br>The date of Exmew's entry into the London Charterhouse is unknown, but Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall's register records his ordination in 1529. Exmew was soon made vicar despite his youth, and acted also as confessor to his prior, John Houghton. Some time after 29 May 1534 he was appointed procurator in place of Humphrey Middlemore, who then became vicar. During Prior Houghton's imprisonment in the Tower for initially refusing the oath to the succession in 1534, and after the prior's martyrdom in 1535, the onus of running the house fell on the vicar and the procurator. The efforts of Cromwell's agent Thomas Bedyll to persuade Exmew, Middlemore, and Sebastian Newdigate to acknowledge Henry VIII as supreme head of the church in England, made on 4 May 1535, the very day of the martyrdom of Prior Houghton, were unsuccessful. On 25 May the three were summoned to Cromwell's house in Stepney and, after examination, were imprisoned, first, according to Chauncy, in the Marshalsea, then in the Tower, where they were chained upright, being offered only meat, which their rule forbade them to eat. After being tried at Westminster, they were hanged in their habits at Tyburn on 19 June 1535. All three were beatified in 1886. By a misunderstanding of the colophon  (fol. 95<i>v</i>) to the copy which he made of <span class="italic">The Cloud of Unknowing</span>, which is today preserved at St Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster, William Exmew has sometimes been credited with the authorship of that anonymous fourteenth-century mystical treatise.<br>
