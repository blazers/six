<span class="headword">Conder,  John</span>  (1714&#150;1781), <span class="occ">Independent minister and tutor</span>, was born on 3 June 1714 at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, the son of Jabez Conder (<i>d</i>. 1727) and Elizabeth Linkern (1688/9&#150;1730). He came from old nonconformist stock as both his father and grandfather served as minister to an Independent congregation at Croyden in Cambridgeshire. John was sent to school first with the Revd Mr Hicks, a Latin master at Potton, Bedfordshire. On the sudden death of his father from a riding accident in 1727, he was transferred to the grammar school at Hitchin, where he boarded first with Francis Robinson, who died suddenly from smallpox, and subsequently with the headmaster, Mr J. Newman. Conder's recovery from the same smallpox seems to mark a new seriousness in life, leaving behind &#145;wild&#146; colleagues who enticed him into &#145;habits of idle-gossiping, card-playing and other vanities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>). He was initially a reluctant scholar, and cherished the hope of following former generations of Conders in farming. After leaving school he proceeded to Dr Parsons's academy at Clerkenwell and from there to the academy run by the King's Head Society, under the direction of Dr Thomas Ridgley and Dr John Eames, then situated at the Plasterers' Hall, Moorfields.<br>
<br>Conder started his ministerial career in Cambridge, at Hog Hill Independent Church on 23 November 1738, and was ordained there on 27 September following. Restoring harmony to a divided congregation, he reportedly gave instruction to three future bishops of the Church of England: Edmund Keen, William Markham, and Beilby Porteous. An encounter with a highwayman on the road to Peterborough became an evangelistic opportunity: Conder's goods were returned, but his assailant was soon recognized and apprehended. The highwayman was sentenced to death; Conder, who was diligent in visiting him in prison, believed he died a converted man. On 8 March 1744 he married Susan (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of John Flindell, leather seller, of Ipswich; they had seven sons.<br>
<br>During his Cambridge pastorate Conder penned <span class="italic">A Serious Address to all Sober Christians of every Denomination among Protestant Dissenters &hellip; on the Important Subject of a Gospel Ministry</span> (1753); this brought him to the attention of the managers of the King's Head Society, who in October 1754 appointed him theological tutor in place of Dr Zephaniah Marryat and boarding tutor at their academy as it moved from Moorfields to Mile End in the following year. To these duties he added the merchant's lecture at Pinners' Hall from October 1759, and on 21 May 1760 he became assistant to the increasingly enfeebled Thomas Hall, minister at Little Moorfields (later the Pavement); he succeeded him on his death in 1762. When the academy moved to Homerton in 1770 Conder ceased to be boarding tutor, residing in Hackney instead. From 1778 William Bennet was his assistant at the Pavement.<br>
<br>In occupying a major London pulpit while fully engaged in running an academy, Conder had double work imposed upon &#145;his Head, Heart and Hands&#146;  (Winter, 36). In so doing, his great aim was to provide a scholarly evangelical ministry for the churches at a time when there appeared to be much heterodoxy. Thus in both pulpit and study he affirmed the importance of evangelical doctrine; after searching the scriptures &#145;with the closest attention and care&#146; he could attest its truth with &#145;full assurance of faith&#146;; &#145;it was the darling theme of his ministrations to recommend Christ in his person, office, work, and grace unto poor sinners&#146;  (Webb, 26). He stressed the importance of the nonconformist tradition, but was not sectarian, for even among dissenters he discerned too much party spirit both within and between denominations. Concern for unity was not, however, to be at the expense of doctrine; indeed he lamented the &#145;general disrelish and disuse of the several great doctrines of Scripture and the reformation&#146;  (J. Conder, <span class="italic">A Serious Address to All Sober Christians &hellip; on the Important Subject of a Gospel Ministry</span>, 1753, 14) by younger divines, which he identified as the major reason why, under their leadership, once flourishing congregations languished. Critical that insufficient scrutiny was undertaken of those offering themselves for ministry, he even included Philip Doddridge within the terms of his censure. Scrutiny of academic capacity was not enough, for vocational aptitude for the evangelical ministry had also to be probed. Although goodness was a necessary prerequisite, Conder argued that not every good man was qualified to undertake a gospel ministry, which required that candidates be &#145;partakers of the evangelical grace of regeneration&#146;, a conviction shared, he believed, by traditional Calvinists, moderate Calvinists, and Arminians alike  (ibid., 22).<br>
<br>Addressing the Society for the Reformation of Manners in 1763 Conder affirmed the importance of the Reformation in securing that &#145;liberty, civil and religious, which is the boast and the glory of Britons&#146;, but argued that the Reformation needed to be earthed in the lifestyle of each individual. Furthermore the maintenance of civil order was an important ministry, for which all Christians had a responsibility, for by their lives they either advanced Satan's kingdom or curbed it. Since governors and magistrates were God's standing representatives in maintaining order, they needed to be appointed wisely. For their part, Christian ministers were called upon &#145;both to preach down and live down the vice and immoralities of the times&#146;  (J. Conder, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Society for the Reformation of Manners</span>, 1763, 16).<br>
<br>Without prior knowledge on his part, Conder was awarded a DD by the University of Aberdeen. The sudden death of his son William, aged nineteen, in 1769 was a trauma from which he never fully recovered. A paralytic stroke, which he survived only a few weeks, occasioned his death in Hackney on 30 May 1781. Conder was buried at Bunhill Fields the Tuesday following, his self-composed epitaph reading: &#145;Peccavi, Resipui, Confidi, Amavi, Requiesco, Resurgam. Et ex gratia Christi, ut ut indignus, regnabo.&#146; He was survived by his wife. Of his children, Thomas was a cartographer and bookseller and the father of Josiah Conder (1789&#150;1855), hymn writer and doyen of nonconformist journalists, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6057/', "James Conder (1761&#150;1823)")</script> a haberdasher who made a name for himself as a numismatist.<br>
