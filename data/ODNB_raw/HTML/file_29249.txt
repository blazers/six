<span class="headword">White,  Jeremiah</span>  (1629&#150;1707), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, is of unknown parents and background. He matriculated as a sizar from Trinity College, Cambridge, in April 1646, graduated BA in 1650, and proceeded MA in 1653. White claimed in his works that he was a fellow of Trinity, but there is no corroborating evidence of this claim. Upon leaving university he became one of the preachers to the council of state and the chaplain to Oliver Cromwell's household. His position with the Cromwells allowed him to befriend Peter Sterry, another of Cromwell's chaplains, and he later wrote a preface to Sterry's <span class="italic">The Rise, Race, and Royalty of the Kingdom of God in the Soul of Man</span> (1683).<br>
<br>White appears to have been something of a romantic regarding women, and this seems to have caused him more than a degree of trouble. A tale is told that while he was chaplain to the Cromwell household he became smitten by Oliver's daughter, Frances. The feeling was mutual and White sought to obtain Frances's hand in marriage. Cromwell was too wily for White and caught White kissing his daughter's hand. In order to save face, White claimed that he was pleading with Frances to intervene for him for the hand of her maid, Katherine. Cromwell, however, was one step ahead of the game and had White and the maid married. Whether this story is true is unverifiable, but love letters in the British Library sent by White to Elizabeth Rogerson of Tunbridge Wells (where he holidayed) in 1686&#150;7 show him to be a hopeless romantic.<br>
<br>After the Restoration White remained faithful to his former employers, and it was alleged that he was the chaplain to a republican secret society known as the Calves Head Club. The club, if it existed, met annually on 30 January, the anniversary of the execution of Charles I, between 1693 and 1699. Its aim was to revive the memory of the English republic and to celebrate the liberation from Stuart tyranny. Tory propagandists contended that the club would meet in the dining-room of a London tavern and would place an executioner's axe above the door as a symbol that it was in session. The members would eat a meal consisting of calves' heads, which represented the executed Charles I, and pike, which symbolized tyranny. After the meal a copy of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> (which was purportedly written by Charles I) would be burnt while the members sang an anti-monarchist anthem holding John Milton's republican <span class="italic">Defensio populi Anglicani</span>. The meeting would end with White offering a toast to the former republic from the skull of a calf, the wine symbolizing the blood of King Charles. Although these allegations are probably too fantastic to be true, they do show that tory propaganda singled out White as a republican troublemaker.<br>
<br>As White had only been a chaplain, he was not ejected from the Church of England in 1662, but he dissented none the less. By 1666 he and his wife, Katherine, had moved to St Albans, where he reputedly lived as the beneficiary of a trust set up by Elizabeth Cromwell, Oliver's recently deceased wife. In 1669 he was noted as preaching in the Hertfordshire town of Elstree and also occasionally at Meeting House Alley, off Queen Street in Rotherhithe. He was acutely aware of the plight of the dissenters and was among the first to compile an account of the sufferings of the nonconformists under the Anglican-Cavalier regime. Calamy contends that some agents of James II offered him a considerable remuneration if he would publish the account as part of James's attempt to undermine the Anglican establishment; White refused these offers, fearing that he would strengthen the Roman Catholic plans of the king.<br>
<br>Theologically, White was a believer in Origen's doctrine of universal salvation and wrote a posthumously published treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Restoration of All Things</span> on the subject. This tract was held in high regard and was reprinted in the mid-nineteenth century by Victorian universalists. He also held to the doctrine of universal toleration, and his <span class="italic">A Perswasive to Moderation and Forbearance in Love among the Divided Forms of Christians</span>, originally delivered as a union lecture in London, was published posthumously. It argued that the departure from the simple message of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> &#145;into the multiplicity or confusion of carnal and worldly wisdom&#146;  (p. xi) was to blame for the tyranny of one sect over another. White counselled forbearance and moderation as the steps to union.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1688 and the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, White resumed his calling as a public preacher. In November 1701 he delivered a sermon on <span class="roman">2 Thessalonians</span> 4: 14 to the mourners at the funeral of the nonconformist minister Francis Fuller. He was also the assistant to the congregational leader Robert Bragge in the ministry of the gathered church at Pewterer's Hall. He died in 1707 aged seventy-eight.<br>
