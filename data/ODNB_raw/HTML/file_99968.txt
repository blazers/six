<span class="headword">Keatinge,  William Richard <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1931&#150;2008), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 18 May 1931 at 30 Beaufort Mansions, Chelsea, London, the only son of Sir Edgar Mayne Keatinge (1905&#150;1998), land agent, later politician and businessman, and his wife, Katharine Lucile, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burrell (1907&#150;1990). His father was briefly Conservative MP for Bury St Edmunds from 1944 to 1945, and was later active in local government; he was knighted in 1960.<br>
<br>Keatinge was educated at Upper Canada College, Toronto, Canada (1940&#150;44), and at Rugby School (1944&#150;9), from where he won a scholarship to read medicine at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and St Thomas's Hospital medical school in London. On 15 October 1955 he married (Margaret Ellen) Annette Hegarty (1932&#150;2000), daughter of David Hegarty, civil servant. They had a son and two daughters. He completed his national service as a naval surgeon-lieutenant in Cambridge (1956&#150;8) before becoming director of studies in medicine and junior fellow at Pembroke College, Cambridge (1958&#150;60). He then spent a year in the Cardiovascular Research Institute, San Francisco, as a Fulbright scholar before returning to England to a Medical Research Council post at the Radcliffe Infirmary and a fellowship of Pembroke College, Oxford (1961&#150;8).<br>
<br>Keatinge joined the department of physiology at the London Hospital Medical College as reader in physiology in 1969 and was promoted to a personal chair in physiology in 1971. He was appointed head of the department of physiology in 1981. Following the merger of the college's basic medical sciences departments with that of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the move to Queen Mary and Westfield College in 1990, he became head of physiology in the joint school. He held this post until his retirement in 1996 when he became an emeritus professor at Queen Mary, University of London (as the newly integrated institution was known from 1995).<br>
<br>Bill Keatinge, as he was always known, ran an active and successful research group, highly rated and supported by the Medical Research Council for many years. Among his many publications were important articles on survival in cold water and local mechanisms controlling blood vessels. His lifelong interest in the effects of heat and cold on mechanisms controlling blood vessels stemmed from his time with the navy while completing his national service. The navy had lost about 30,000 people from cold immersion in the Second World War and needed to know how to reduce deaths from cold. During the 1980s there was much concern regarding excessive deaths among the elderly in the UK during winter. In a series of experiments Keatinge showed that both cold and heat stress caused alterations in blood composition that promoted arterial thrombosis and subsequently death from strokes and heart attacks.<br>
<br>Keatinge wrote many chapters in textbooks and journals and published more than 200 research papers, principally on temperature regulation and the control of blood vessels. In 1969 he published <span class="italic">Survival in Cold Water: the Physiology and Treatment of Immersion, Hypothermia and of Drowning</span> and in 1980 <span class="italic">Local Mechanisms Controlling Blood Vessels</span>. He was elected to membership of the Physiological Society (1968), was a member of its committee (1977&#150;81), and was a member of the editorial board of the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span> (1979&#150;86). He was elected FRCP (1991) and was a fellow of the Cardiovascular Research Institute, San Francisco. He had numerous international collaborations, developed especially close links with Russia, and led a large EU Eurowinter project that co-ordinated research in eight European countries. After the break-up of the Soviet Union it became possible for him to extend his Eurowinter project to Siberia. He made full use of being part of a multi-faculty environment at Queen Mary and Westfield College by forging a link with the Russian department and learning to speak the language well enough to be understood on his visits to the Russian Federation.<br>
<br>Keatinge served as preclinical dean at the London Hospital Medical College at a time of considerable change and uncertainty. After the move to Queen Mary and Westfield College, a new building and a new curriculum were initiated and Keatinge played a leading role in designing and implementing these changes. He was elected dean of basic medical sciences at Queen Mary and Westfield in 1991. He took up the reins of authority when student numbers were being rapidly increased and staff appointments reduced. His term as dean ended in 1994 and he left administration behind, to concentrate on research. After his formal retirement in 1996 he continued to attract grants and to pursue his research interests. He retained an office at Queen Mary and concentrated on environmental problems, including global warming and the fact that cold caused far more deaths than heat. He was frequently the expert, interviewed by the media, at times of extreme cold and during heatwaves. He also made substantial contributions to the teaching of human physiology to undergraduates and postgraduates throughout his career.<br>
<br>In addition to his lifelong interest in physiology, Keatinge had interests in classical archaeology, history, and poetry. He enjoyed travel, especially dinghy sailing in the waters of the Aegean. He had an enduring love for his home in Teffont Evias, Wiltshire, and had a keen interest in forestry. After the death of his first wife, on 11 November 2005 he married Lynette Margaret Nelson, a widow six years his junior, and daughter of Phillip Anthony Browne, police officer. Although he became ill with prostate cancer he faced his illness with considerable courage and dignity. He continued to work until a few weeks before his death and completed his final projects. He died on 11 April 2008 at his home, Rose Cottage, Teffont Evias, and was buried in the churchyard at Teffont Evias on 19 April 2008. He was survived by his wife, Lynette, and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
