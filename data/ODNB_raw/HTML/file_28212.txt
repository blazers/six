<span class="headword">Vere,  John  de</span>, seventh earl of Oxford  (1312&#150;1360), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the only son of Alfonso de Vere (<i>d</i>. 1328) and his wife, Jane Foliot. Alfonso was the younger brother of Robert de Vere, sixth earl of Oxford, who died childless in 1331, and John thus succeeded to the earldom, and to the hereditary chamberlainship of England, in that year. In 1336 he married Maud, the second of the four daughters and coheir of Giles, Lord Badlesmere, of Badlesmere in Kent, who died in 1338.<br>
<br>Most of John de Vere's adult life was spent in the service of Edward III on campaigns in France and Scotland. He formed a close connection with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2778/', "William Bohun, earl of Northampton")</script>, who was almost exactly the same age. The two were brothers-in-law: Northampton married Elizabeth, the third of Giles Badlesmere's four daughters; they campaigned together in France and Scotland, and were associated on various commissions in England. They died within nine months of one another in 1360. Oxford's military career began with the Scottish campaigns of the 1330s. In 1334&#150;5 he served on the Roxburgh campaign, bringing a retinue of twenty-eight men-at-arms and twelve mounted archers. He then took part in the summer campaign of 1335, on this occasion as a member of the retinue of Earl Warenne. When a French invasion threatened in 1339 he was appointed keeper of the &#145;maritime lands&#146; in Essex; in November he put to sea in the king's service, and in March 1340 he served in Flanders with the earl of Warwick. In February 1342 he took part in a tournament at Dunstable, and Murimuth identifies him as one of the &#145;young earls of the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Adae Murimuth continuatio chronicarum</span>, 123) alongside Derby, Warwick, Northampton, Pembroke, and Suffolk, whom he contrasts with nobles such as Gloucester, Arundel, and Warenne who were absent from the tournament on account of their age and infirmity.<br>
<br>In August 1342 Oxford set out on his first major campaign in France, serving in Brittany with the earl of Northampton, who had been appointed Edward III's lieutenant there. The expedition relieved Brest, and on 30 September put the forces of Charles de Blois to flight at Morlaix in a hard-fought battle. In the following year Oxford served with Northampton on the expedition sent to Scotland to relieve Lochmaben Castle, and in 1345 he again campaigned with Northampton in Brittany. A later tradition has it that on their return his ships were blown so far off course that he and his retinue were forced ashore on the coast of Connacht, where their goods were pillaged by the local people. However, he was at Quimperl&eacute; in Brittany in January 1346, and it is possible that he and Northampton overwintered there.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1346 John de Vere joined Edward III's expedition to Normandy. He and Northampton may have gone to Normandy straight from Brittany. According to Froissart, Oxford fought alongside Edward, the Black Prince, at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy on 26 August, and was one of the commanders who sent word to the king asking for reinforcements, as the division was hard-pressed by the French. Edward replied with his famous message &#145;Let the boy win his spurs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chroniques</span>, 3.183). Oxford then took part in the siege of Calais, but in 1348 he was said to be &#145;detained by severe sickness&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1346&#150;1349</span>, 598), and he did not campaign again until 1355, when he accompanied the Black Prince to Gascony. He then joined in the prince's famous raid into Languedoc, while early in the following year he is reported as campaigning in the area around Rocamadour in Quercy.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1356 the Black Prince's army moved north and encountered the French at Poitiers on 19 September. John de Vere and the earl of Warwick were in command of the vanguard. During the battle Oxford took a group of archers to attack the flank of the French cavalry and brought them down, preventing them from overrunning the main body of English archers. After the battle he returned to Bordeaux, but as the negotiations for peace with France became more difficult he was summoned to a council in London on 10 October 1359, and subsequently joined the king on the Rheims campaign of 1359&#150;60. He died, probably during the raid into Burgundy, on 23 or 24 January 1360. His body was brought home to England and buried in the family burial place at Earls Colne Priory in Essex.<br>
<br>Oxford had enjoyed an active military career, though none of the contemporary chroniclers suggests that he had exceptional prowess or that he acquired great fame on the battlefield. Indeed, Edward III did not reward him as generously as some of his other companions-in-arms. He never became a member of the Order of the Garter, unlike the earl of Northampton, and although he was permitted to re-enfeoff his estates so as to give his wife a substantial life interest in them, he enjoyed little royal patronage. In a sense, the de Veres were on the fringes of the titled nobility. Although their earldom was ancient, their inheritance, and thus their resources, were modest by comparison with their peers. The retinues he brought to his campaigns were small compared with those of his fellow earls. He managed to augment his inheritance with his wife's share of the Badlesmere inheritance, but this too was modest. Service in the king's wars was not obviously a source of reward or profit for Oxford; indeed, his wages were often assigned on the subsidy or paid in the form of grants of wool, and there is no evidence for a major building programme either at his main residence, Castle Hedingham in Essex, or at Earls Colne Priory, of which he was patron, even though the priory was damaged when the tower and crossing collapsed in 1356. In his will Oxford left only 100 marks for works at the priory.<br>
<br>Oxford's widow died in 1366. They had four sons and two daughters. Their eldest son, John, married Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh Courtenay, earl of Devon, but he died <i>c</i>.1350. Another son, Robert, is known to have died in his father's lifetime, but otherwise nothing is known about him. Both John and Robert were buried at Earls Colne Priory. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101271/', "Thomas de Vere")</script>, the elder surviving son, was born between 1336 and 1338, married Maud, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27975/', "Sir Ralph Ufford")</script>, and succeeded to the earldom on his father's death. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28205/', "Aubrey de Vere")</script>, the younger surviving son, was born about 1338&#150;40 and became tenth earl in 1393 on the restoration of the earldom after the exile and forfeiture of Thomas's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28218/', "Robert de Vere, ninth earl of Oxford and duke of Ireland")</script>, Richard II's favourite. The elder daughter, Margaret, married first Henry, Lord Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1369), second Sir Nicholas Loveyn of Penshurst, Kent, (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1375), and third <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7564/', "John Devereux, Baron Devereux (d. 1393)")</script>. John de Vere left 1000 marks in his will for the marriage portion of a second daughter, Matilda, but otherwise nothing is known of her.<br>
<br>If the instructions in his will were implemented, Oxford was buried on the south side of the choir of the lady chapel of Earls Colne Priory. His widow asked to be buried in the priory &#145;near the body of my worshipful lord Earl deceased&#146;  (Benton, 263). The alabaster effigies on one of the tombs known to have been in the priory in 1653, and of which a drawing survives, have been identified as those of John de Vere and his wife, but they appear to have been destroyed in the early eighteenth century. None of the tombs subsequently removed to St Stephen's Chapel near Bures in Suffolk has been identified as that of John de Vere.<br>
