<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pepler, Sir  George Lionel</span>  (1882&#150;1959), <span class="occ">town planner</span>, was born at Croydon, Surrey, on 24 February 1882, the third child and second son of George Henry Pepler (1849&#150;1884), brewer, and his wife, Emma Florence Mills (1853&#150;1935); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66287/', "Harry Douglas Clarke Pepler (known as Hilary)")</script> was his brother. Educated at Bootham School, York, and the Leys School, Cambridge, he was articled to Walter Hooker, a surveyor in Croydon. On 24 July 1903, at Clifton, he married Edith Amy (1877/8&#150;1942), daughter of Alfred E. Bobbett, solicitor, of Bristol; the couple had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>From 1905 until 1914, in partnership with Ernest G. Allen, Pepler carried on a practice in surveying and the then emerging vocation of town planning. The partners were awarded three gold medals at housing exhibitions in 1908 and 1910 and were among the first to specialize in laying out new villages and housing estates for landowners, among others at Fallings Park near Wolverhampton and at Knebworth, Hertfordshire. During that period Pepler became a member of the Garden City (later Town and Country Planning) Association, and was active in the advocacy of the garden city concept and of the operation by local authorities of their permissive planning powers under the first <span class="roman">Town Planning Act</span>, of 1909. In 1914 John Burns, president of the Local Government Board from 1905 to 1914 and the &#145;father&#146; of the act, called Pepler into the planning administration of the board, where he succeeded Thomas Adams as chief technical planning officer, a position which he retained, through several changes of his designation and that of the department, until 1946.<br>
<br>Pepler's qualities proved admirably suited to the task of inducing local authorities to adopt town planning powers and guiding them in putting these into practice. Having a passionate belief in the necessity of planning, as well as persuasiveness, patience, and tact, he was allowed by successive ministers (or perhaps quietly assumed) exceptional freedom and scope in what was essentially propaganda. He was a major influence in the conversion of public and official opinion to acceptance of a new, contentious, and difficult governmental process. The experience and authority which he gained in this key position enabled him, just before his retirement, to make a weighty contribution to the formulation of the <span class="roman">Town and Country Planning Act</span> of 1947, which established the planning of all land as a normal function of central and local government.<br>
<br>Pepler's work and influence in planning extended far outside his official position. He was one of the founders in 1913 of the Town Planning Institute, its honorary secretary and treasurer until his death, twice president (1919&#150;20, 1949&#150;50), and first gold medallist (1953). Keenly interested in the training of planners, he was unfailingly helpful in encouragement and advice to students and young members of the profession, and was chairman (1930&#150;59) of the Town Planning Joint Examination Board. He attended regularly the annual sessions of the town and country planning summer school from its foundation in 1933, and was its president in 1943&#150;59. Pepler was also active in the work of the International Federation for Housing and Town Planning, of which he was president in 1935&#150;8 and 1947&#150;52, and thereafter honorary president for life. The survival of the federation despite the disruption of the Second World War was due mainly to his devotion and that of the honorary secretary, Elizabeth Evelyn Halton, during the war years. On 31 January 1947 Elizabeth (1900/01&#150;1998), the daughter of a merchant, Eldred Halton, became Pepler's second wife. She was a Conservative member of the London county council from 1946 to 1965 and deputy chairman of the council in 1956&#150;7.<br>
<br>Pepler was a member of the regional survey committee for south Wales (1920), of the unhealthy areas committee over which Neville Chamberlain presided (1921), and of the royal commission on common land (1955&#150;8); chairman of the Institution of Professional Civil Servants (1937&#150;42), of the inter-allied committee for physical planning and reconstruction (1942&#150;5), and for many years an active influence in the Council for the Preservation of Rural England and the National Playing Fields Association. With P. W. Macfarlane he prepared the outline plan for the north-east development area (1949) and in 1950&#150;54 he was planning adviser to Singapore.<br>
<br>Pepler was elected an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1937, appointed CB in 1944, and knighted in 1948. His recreations were mainly out of doors and included golf and other games, swimming, gardening, and bonfires. He had a cottage at Lulworth, Dorset, where, with his family, for nearly fifty years he spent happy holidays by the sea. He died at Moffatt House, Weymouth, on 13 April 1959 and was buried at West Lulworth church. In 1960 the headland previously known as East Point, Lulworth Cove, was renamed Pepler's Point. In 1963 the George Pepler international award was established to enable young people to travel abroad to study chosen aspects of town and country planning.<br>
