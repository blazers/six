<span class="headword">Knox,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and army chaplain</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15783/', "John Knox (d. in or after 1654)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15782/', "Knox, John (c.1555&#150;1623)")</script>], minister of Bowden in Teviotdale, Roxburghshire, and his wife, Margaret Douglas. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15782/', "John Knox (c.1555&#150;1623)")</script>, minister of Melrose, who was thought to have been the nephew of the great reformer; the family took conspicuous pride in this link. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and graduated MA on 15 July 1641. Little is known of his activities during the following decade. It is possible that he remained in the Scottish capital, where his father enjoyed an influential position in the assembly of commissions, but it appears that he did not immediately seek a parish and that by 1650 he had instead become private chaplain to Archibald Douglas, earl of Ormond (1609&#150;1655).<br>
<br>As the army of the Commonwealth surged northwards in the summer of 1650, Knox sought refuge behind the walls of the Douglas stronghold of Tantallon Castle and became garrison chaplain. Since the English forces under Major-General Monck were insufficiently equipped to impose a stranglehold on the area, Knox was able to lead the countess of Ormond and her sister-in-law, Lady Alexander Douglas, to the safety of a waiting fishing vessel at North Berwick&#151;despite being marooned on a sandbank at low tide, deserted by his military escort, and assailed by Commonwealth soldiers. Forced to surrender in order to buy more time in which to effect the escape, Knox then charmed his captors over glasses of wine before seizing the horse of an English lieutenant and riding it back to the safety of the castle gates. Thereafter he continued to distinguish himself in the eyes of the royalist garrison by his gallantry and cunning, and was even able to capture a merchant vessel which had been running in supplies to the besieging army across the Firth of Forth. However, the arrival of heavy artillery in February 1651 profoundly changed the nature of the conflict and effectively sealed the fate of the garrison. After a twelve-day bombardment, the castle surrendered on 23 February 1651, though Knox received &#145;very good conditions&#146; upon his own capitulation  (Wodrow, 2.352). He was probably freed almost immediately.<br>
<br>Knox then became chaplain to Sir John Brown's regiment of horse, in the royalist army raised by David Leslie. He was with the troops who blocked the passage of the Commonwealth army across the fords of the River Forth near Stirling in early July 1651. On 20 July he appears to have fought with the detachment which gave battle to Lambert's numerically superior English host at Inverkeithing, and taken part in the furious counter-charges made that day by Scottish lancers. Following the final flight of the royalists, however, he was arrested and taken to Edinburgh. From his prison cell he maintained a lively and useful correspondence with the exiled royalist court, where his elder brother Henry was a courtier and royalist agent. A letter from Charles II, dated 31 August 1653, promised that the king would use &#145;all the endeavours I can to free you&#146;  (Rogers, 72) and in return asked if Knox might find &#145;some way &hellip; to assist me with money, which would be a very seasonable obligation, and could never be forgotten by me&#146;  (Wodrow, 2.352&#150;3). Knox was released from custody late that year, and having been only a probationer during his military service he was finally ordained and became minister for North Leith. He probably did raise money for the royalist cause at this point, and it is clear that he acted as a conduit for secret correspondence between the exiled king and his Scottish supporters. In the mid-1650s the billeting of English soldiers in his church forced him to preach from the citadel of North Leith until he was ejected by the military from his makeshift pulpit. On 23 June 1659 he married the eighteen-year-old Jean Dalgleish of Cramond.<br>
<br>Despite his past loyalties, the Restoration did not bring Knox any improvement in his fortunes. He was firmly committed to the self-government of the kirk and bitterly resented the reintroduction of episcopacy. In defiance of the authorities, he led public worship at Newhaven and as a result was deprived of his parish by parliament on 11 June 1662 and by the privy council on 1 October. Although he was advised to journey to London to petition the king, Knox appears to have remained in Scotland, living near his former parish. He was one of those ministers who accepted the terms of the earl of Lauderdale's second indulgence of 1672 and was licensed to preach again in September of that year. He was given the parish of West Calder but soon fell out with his fellow incumbent, William Weir, who had refused both to appear before the privy council and to quit his manse in favour of Knox and his family. The row deepened and, having been summoned to Edinburgh on 5 September 1673 in order to affirm his own loyalty to the government and the episcopate, Knox appears to have used the occasion to push home his allegations of misconduct against his rival. Having heard that Weir had spoken against the king and had also &#145;by severall indirect and unhandsome wayes circumvein and abuse[d] the said Mr. John [Knox] and forced him to desert the said charge&#146; of his parish, the privy council found against Weir. He was branded a rebel and dismissed from the parish, while Knox was confirmed as the sole incumbent and rewarded with the whole &#145;stipend of that Kirk for the year 1673&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 4.98&#150;9, 101).<br>
<br>A regular income failed to materialize, however. Knox was widowed on 26 October 1673 and, with a young family to support, he felt impelled to petition the Scottish privy council in February 1675 and June 1677 for the payment of his arrears stretching over several years. Financial hardship may have driven him into hardening his attitude towards the hierarchy in both church and state. Charges of refusing to celebrate the king's birthday and of refusing to read out in church the order proclaiming a thanksgiving day for the deliverance of Charles II from the Rye House plot were brought against him in late November 1684 and he was once again brought before the privy council. Despite listing his services to the royal cause during the Commonwealth and protectorate periods, his refusal to sign a bond promising that he would never preach illegally again effectively condemned him in the eyes of the councillors and he was committed to the Tolbooth until such a time as he learned the proper &#145;cautione&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 10.38). He was not, as has been sometimes suggested, sent to serve out part of his sentence on the infamous Bass Rock: from November 1684 to March 1685 he was closely confined in Edinburgh's Tolbooth gaol. By the spring of 1685 poor conditions there had undermined his health, and in March he was paroled for one month on a bond of 5,000 Scottish merks so that he might undertake &#145;a course of phisick&#146;  (ibid., 171). This parole was subsequently extended twice more in April and once in June, &#145;in regard of his continowd sicknes and infirmitie&#146; and on account of his case being so &#145;singular and his loyaltie notourlie known&#146;  (ibid., 38). It was obvious that Knox represented no threat to the established order and he moved hurriedly to embrace the new offers of indulgence made in February and April 1687. Once his release was confirmed as being permanent, he returned to his old parish at North Leith, where he ministered to his congregation without interference or event until his death in March 1688. He was buried in Leith churchyard.<br>
<br>Knox was survived by at least three of his four children. His son John later served as the garrison chaplain to Edinburgh Castle, and in 1691 one of his daughters, Jean, married John Tullidelph, the minister of Dunbarney. Though undistinguished in terms of his preaching style and theological reflections, John Knox managed to combine for most of his career a commitment to both the presbyterian Church of Scotland and the house of Stuart. His move into opposition later in his life reflected the increasing strains placed on the Restoration settlement by its chief beneficiaries in Edinburgh and Whitehall.<br>
