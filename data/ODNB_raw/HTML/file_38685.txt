<span class="headword">Ecroyd,  William Farrer</span>  (1827&#150;1915), <span class="occ">worsted manufacturer and politician</span>, was born on 14 July 1827, at Lomeshaye, near Burnley, Lancashire, the first of the four children of William Ecroyd (1796&#150;1876), worsted spinner, and his second wife, Margaret (1797&#150;1835), the eldest daughter of William Farrer, a farmer at Wythmoor, Kendal, and his wife, Mary. Yeomen in origin (their ancestry was traced back to the fourteenth century by Ecroyd's second son, the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33093/', "William Farrer")</script>), the Ecroyds became members of the Society of Friends in the 1680s. They added further small estates to their existing property in the early eighteenth century, and in 1747 set up the worsted spinning and weaving firm at Edgend, moving in 1780 to Lomeshaye, where the family was to continue to run the firm until 1933.<br>
<br>Educated at Lower Bank Academy, Blackburn, Ecroyd went on in 1837 to the Quaker Ackworth School before joining the family firm in 1841. Having learned the trade under his father, a good-humoured, fat, and communicative mill owner, Ecroyd was made a partner in 1849. This was a period of rapid growth and prosperity for the firm, as it extended its manufacturing capacity to over 3000 looms, and its workforce to about 1250. By the 1860s, it was one of the few remaining houses producing soft woollen fabrics in 150 varieties for the home and foreign trade. Imbued with a strong religious sense of the stewardship of wealth, Ecroyd was involved in a wide range of activities designed to improve the condition of the workpeople and to mollify the embittered industrial relations which had marked north-east Lancashire in the early 1850s. He ensured that the Lomeshaye mills were equipped with healthy, well ventilated rooms and provided dining-rooms, a sick club, a mill library, and half-time schools. He was widely esteemed not only for his business sense but his upright conduct, fair dealing with the workforce, and unselfish actions. However, Ecroyd's broadening theological vision, derived from Kingsley, Maurice, and Arnold, increasingly separated him from his father and from the narrow tenets of the Quakers, which he now believed inhibited the proper Christian endeavours of employers. In 1851 Ecroyd had married, within the Society of Friends, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1867), daughter of Thomas Backhouse of York, a railway and bank director with strong botanical interests; they had three sons and six daughters. Following his second marriage in 1869 to the Baptist Anna Maria (1831&#150;1913), daughter of another local employer George Foster (once a partner of Cobden and a strong free trader), Ecroyd and his wife continued to attend Quaker meetings but he was to renounce formally his membership of the Society of Friends following his father's death.<br>
<br>Having abandoned his family's Quakerism, Ecroyd also abandoned its Liberalism, standing unsuccessfully for parliament in 1874 as Conservative candidate for Carlisle, upholding in politics the Church of England principles which he had now embraced. He also spoke widely on behalf of denominational education and served on the executive of the National Educational Union from 1875 to 1879. His political views, however, were to move in less conventional directions by the later 1870s, when the worsted industry began to suffer more than most from the impact of foreign, especially French, competition. Ecroyd, a member of the Anti-Corn Law League as a youth and a keen reader of political economy, now became one of the more thoughtful critics of free trade and the most articulate exponent of the alternative creed of &#145;fair trade&#146;. In 1879 he composed its leading tract, <span class="italic">The Policy of Self-Help</span>, arguing that Britain's policy of free trade would only be reciprocated by other nations if Britain herself imposed import duties both on foreign wheat and manufactured imports. At the same time, free imports from the colonies would strengthen the empire (on the federal model of the United States) and help prevent Britain's decline to the rank of third-rate power.<br>
<br>Ecroyd stood unsuccessfully on this platform (&#145;Ecroydism&#146; as his opponent Lord Hartington called it) in North-East Lancashire in 1880 but won a dramatic by-election victory at Preston in 1881. &#145;Fair trade&#146; was now at its peak and, with several spokesmen in the House of Commons, was able to bring considerable pressure to bear during the unsuccessful renegotiation of the Anglo-French commercial (Cobden) treaty of 1880&#150;82. Ecroyd did not defend Preston in 1885 (on grounds of ill health) but did unsuccessfully oppose Hartington in the Rossendale division of Lancashire. He was not to stand again but in 1885 he was appointed by Lord Salisbury to the royal commission on the depression in trade and industry, which provided the most effective outlet for the &#145;fair trade&#146; analysis of the British economy in the later nineteenth century. Ecroyd himself dropped from the forefront of this movement after 1886 but its central strands were to be taken up by Chamberlain, with Ecroyd's warm encouragement and approval, in his advocacy of tariff reform in 1903. Ecroyd was ready to campaign locally for tariff reform and reputedly wrote several tariff reform pamphlets.<br>
<br>After 1886 Ecroyd moved back from the national scene to the family firm, and increasingly to the Herefordshire estate at Credenhill which he had acquired in 1880. There he devoted himself to agriculture but also to replicating in the countryside the paternalism he had first practised in the town, erecting model dwellings and new schools, taking over the patronage of and restoring the local church, rebuilding the parsonage, and aiding the Revd Charles Henry Bulmer in his campaign against the adulteration of cider. Yet Ecroyd still spent much time in Lancashire, and at his estate at Whitbarrow in Westmorland. Having overseen the reconstruction of the family firm on limited liability lines in 1896, he remained nominally its chairman until his death, but increasingly withdrew from its affairs. By the standards of its time, it was now only a modestly sized enterprise and Ecroyd's own fortune probably owed more to prudent speculation in overseas railways than to his industrial shareholdings. In 1896 he commemorated over fifty years' service with a retirement address on the duties of employers (<span class="italic">A Few Words to the Workers at Lomeshaye Mills</span>, 1896), with the factory evoked more as a site of moral training than of profit-making. His own practice of such duties had been exemplary, not only within his factory but in his providing the adjoining town of Nelson with schools, a new Anglican church (St Mary's) in 1884, and generous support of Burnley Hospital. He also acted as JP in both Lancashire and Herefordshire and was deputy lieutenant of Herefordshire.<br>
<br>An invalid in later years, Ecroyd died at Credenhill on 9 November 1915, and was buried there on 11 November. Between the 1850s and 1880s he had been a frequent traveller in Europe, and in England, a keen admirer of natural beauty, much influenced by Wordsworth. Ecroyd's own interest in history (he believed his name was derived from the Mercian King Croyda, also providing the derivation of Credenhill, which itself abutted Offa's Dyke) was taken up by his sons, while his eldest son Thomas Backhouse Ecroyd (1857&#150;1945) took over the declining firm. Part of the Credenhill estate later became home to the Special Air Service.<br>
