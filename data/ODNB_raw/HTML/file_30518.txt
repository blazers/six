<span class="headword">Baddeley,  Mountford John Byrde</span>  (1843&#150;1906), <span class="occ">compiler of guidebooks</span>, born at Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, on 6 March 1843, was the second son of three children of Whieldon Baddeley, solicitor, of Rochester, Staffordshire, and his wife, Frances Blurton Webb. His elder brother, Richard Whieldon Baddeley (1840&#150;1876), was the author of several novels and a volume of poems, <span class="italic">The Golden Lute</span> (1876), which was published posthumously. After education at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham, Baddeley obtained a classical scholarship at Clare College, Cambridge, and after matriculating in October 1864, graduated BA with a second class in the classical tripos in 1868. In 1869 he was appointed assistant master, and subsequently he became housemaster, at Somersetshire College, Bath. From 1880 to 1884 he was assistant master at Sheffield grammar school.<br>
<br>After retiring from teaching Baddeley settled at The Hollies, Windermere, and later moved to 2 Lake View Villas, Bowness-on-Windermere. Intimately acquainted with the Lake District and keenly interested in local affairs, he was chairman of the Bowness local board until its dissolution in 1894, and supported movements for preserving footpaths and for popularizing the area as a pleasure resort. On his initiative signposts were placed by the Lake District Association on mountain paths, and a flying squad of young members was organized to report periodically on the condition of the passes. The new road from Skelwith Bridge to Langdale, and the drive along the west side of Thirlmere, which was completed by the Manchester corporation in 1894, were largely due to Baddeley's active intervention. He was opposed to the multiplication of railways or of local industries, favouring legislation for the &#145;preservation of the scenery&#146;  (M. J. B. Baddeley, <span class="italic">English Lake District</span>, 1880, introduction).<br>
<br>From 1884 to 1906 Baddeley, who was an untiring walker through most parts of England and a close observer of nature, mainly occupied himself with preparing the <span class="roman">Thorough Guide</span> series of guidebooks for Great Britain and Ireland. The series opened with the <span class="italic">English Lake District</span> (1880; 21st edn, 1956), Baddeley's most popular work. The series soon extended to fifteen titles, covering Scotland, northern and western England, Wales, Ireland, and the Isle of Man. Baddeley's guides were accurate, concise, and practical. He had the gift not only of describing natural scenery but also of forming a comparative estimate of its beauty. He paid special attention to the needs of the walker; although an enthusiastic mountaineer he deprecated hazardous adventure.<br>
<br>In 1891 Baddeley married Millicent Satterthwaite, daughter of Robert Henry Machell Michaelson-Yeates of Olive Mount, Windermere. They had no children. Baddeley died on 19 November 1906, at his home, 2 Lake View Villas, Bowness, of pneumonia, which he contracted on a visit to Selby while revising one of his Yorkshire volumes; he was buried at Bowness. His wife survived him. In 1907 a clock tower was erected at Bowness in his memory by public subscription from friends and admirers in all parts of the British Isles.<br>
