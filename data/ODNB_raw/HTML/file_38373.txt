<span class="headword">Stephenson,  Rowland</span>  (1782&#150;1856), <span class="occ">art collector, politician, and bankrupt</span>, was born at sea between Florida and England on 19 May 1782 and baptized at St Andrew's Church, Holborn, London, on 2 August. He was the third surviving son and fifth of eight children of John Stephenson (<i>bap</i>. 1741, <i>d</i>. 1822), merchant and banker, of Great Ormond Street, London, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1814), the daughter of James Broadley, of Mersham, Kent. John Stephenson was the nephew of Rowland Stephenson (1728&#150;1807), a distinguished patron of the arts and member of parliament for Carlisle (1787&#150;90), who took him in as a partner in the Lombard Street bank of Stephenson, Remington &amp; Co. after his business as an agent victualler and member (by 1776) of the king's council at Pensacola, Florida, had collapsed during the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>On leaving Eton College, where he was educated from 1796 to 1799, the younger Rowland Stephenson also joined the bank. On 23 April 1807 he married his cousin Mary Eliza (<i>bap</i>. 1786, <i>d</i>. 1821), the granddaughter of Rowland Stephenson senior, with whom he had eight children. Her father, the banker Edward Stephenson (1759&#150;1833), of Farley Hill, Berkshire, was an authority on the composer Johann Sebastian Bach and a collector of Cremona violins. The Stephensons' circle included the conductor Sir George Smart and the comedian Charles Mathews. &#145;The dapper little banker&#146;  (Lennox, 2.48&#150;52), Rowland junior, became renowned for his musical soir&eacute;es and Sunday entertainments for London friends at Marshalls, a villa near Romford, Essex, which he purchased in 1816, adding to it the manor of Cockermouth, Essex, further properties in Romford, and the How Hatch estate near Dagenham. He invested heavily in Thomas Horton's Regent's Park Colosseum, which opened in January 1829.<br>
<br>Stephenson's parliamentary ambitions were thwarted at Carlisle and possibly Hull in 1816 for want of money. He intensified his efforts following the death of his wife on 21 October 1821 and his succession to his father's banking partnership in 1822. Spending lavishly on entertainments, petitioning, and legal costs, he boldly opposed the re-election of Henry Goulburn, lately appointed Irish secretary, for West Looe in February 1822, and of Jonathan Raine for the Cornish borough of Newport in March 1823. He was returned as a tory for Leominster in 1826 after a committee of the House of Commons upheld his claim that the lottery contractor Thomas Bish, who defeated him at the poll, was disqualified, being a government contractor (19 February 1827). Stephenson's parliamentary career was distinguished solely by his manner of leaving it in December 1828, when unsecured advances authorized by his assistant John Henry Lloyd came to light and bankrupted Remington's bank and Stephenson himself. He fled with Lloyd to Savannah, Georgia; rewards were offered for his apprehension, and he was detained in a debtors' prison in New York, but extradition proceedings failed (26 March 1829). He was formally bankrupted under the twelve-month rule on 19 January 1830, and thus forfeited his parliamentary seat. The property and effects seized and sold by the London auctioneer Shuttleworth between 29 January and 3 June 1829 included the Essex estates, a mansion (7 Clarence Place, Dover), a box at the Drury Lane Theatre, and the contents of his apartments at St Bartholomew's Hospital (of which he was treasurer, 1824&#150;9). He had acquired the Shakespearian elbow chair and portrait &#145;after Reynolds&#146; of the dramatist David Garrick, together with numerous books, pictures, and effects from Garrick's villa at Hampton, when they were sold at auction by Robins, Burrell &amp; Sons, and Saunders in 1823.<br>
<br>From October 1829 until his death on 2 July 1856 Stephenson lived at Farley Hill, a 170 acre estate at Bensalem township near Bristol, Pennsylvania, where he was buried in the churchyard of St James's Episcopal Church. The sole beneficiary of his will, proved at Doylestown, Pennsylvania, on 16 July 1856, was his eldest son Rowland Macdonald Stephenson (1808&#150;1895), who was knighted in October 1856 for his services as a civil engineer and managing director of the East India Railway Company.<br>
