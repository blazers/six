<span class="headword">Holliday,  John</span>  (1730/31&#150;1801), <span class="occ">barrister and writer</span>, about whose birth and parents nothing is known, entered Lincoln's Inn on 5 May 1759 and was called to the bar on 23 April 1771. By August 1789 he married Elizabeth, daughter and sole heir of Elizabeth Harrison, widow, of Dilhorne Manor, Staffordshire, with whom he had an only child, Elizabeth Lydia. As well as acquiring Dilhorne through marriage, Holliday purchased nearby Cheadle Park from Sir Joseph Banks, and one or both properties incorporated working coalmines. He also built a successful legal practice, specializing in conveyancing, and engaged in charitable occupations, becoming a governor of the royal hospitals Bridewell and Bedlam, and the Foundling Hospital. Holliday also found time to indulge his eclectic interests. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 9 March 1786, and he was an active member of the Society of Arts and Manufactures, winning the society's gold medal in 1792 for having planted 118,000 mixed timber trees on his estates.<br>
<br>Holliday cultivated his modest literary talent over many years. He is said to have composed a translation of Virgil in hexameter verse in his youth. Towards the end of his life he published <span class="italic">The British Oak</span> (1800), a rambling poem, in couplets, which celebrates selected episodes of local and national history during the life of an ancient oak tree planted in Cheadle Park. The poem was dedicated to Nelson in gratitude for his victory at the Nile (1798). Holliday's most significant prose publication is <span class="italic">The Life of William Late Earl of Mansfield</span> (1797), a well researched biography of his friend and patron William Murray, the controversial judge and eminent politician. Holliday had been in awe of Murray since the latter's appointment as lord chief justice in 1756. Murray's vigorous toryism probably indicates Holliday's politics also. Holliday personally gathered some of his materials for his biography from among the most eminent lawyers of his day, confirming his acceptance within the highest circles of the legal profession. He sat to George Romney, in London, between 1791 and 1793. At the end of the nineteenth century the painting hung in Lupton House, Brixham, Devon, which burnt down on 8 March 1926. The <span class="italic">Torquay Times</span> for 12 March disclosed that a Romney had been destroyed in the blaze. Pictures and books which were salvaged from the fire were subsequently stored on the first floor of a stable block which also burnt down, on 23 February 1928. The portrait survived, much damaged, and after restoration was sold to a private buyer.<br>
<br>At the very end of his life Holliday wrote a brief memoir of Owen Salusbury Brereton, a past vice-president of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, which appeared posthumously in the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> for 1801. By a curious irony Holliday was expected to be selected for the same office but he died at his house in Great Ormond Street, London, on 9 March 1801, a week before the election was due to take place. According to an obituary he died &#145;in his seventy first year&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 71/1). In addition to his immediate family members, Holliday made Charles Abbot, future lord chief justice, one of the beneficiaries of his will. He also directed that mourning rings should be sent to, among others, Nelson's former commander in the Mediterranean Admiral John Jervis, Earl St Vincent, and his wife, his neighbours in nearby Meaford, Staffordshire.<br>
