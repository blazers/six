<span class="headword">Clinton, Sir  Henry</span>  (1771&#150;1829), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 9 March 1771 in Weybridge, Surrey, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5681/', "General Sir Henry Clinton (1730&#150;1795)")</script> and his wife, Harriet (1747&#150;1772), daughter of Thomas Carter. Henry and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5687/', "Sir William Henry Clinton")</script>, were brought up by their aunt, Elizabeth Carter, following the premature death of their mother at the age of twenty-six. In 1782, while his father was commanding the British forces in the United States, Henry was sent to Eton College, where he joined his brother. In 1785 Henry left Eton with William, and soon after entering the army on 10 October 1787 as an ensign in the 11th regiment took leave and set off for France and Germany. In January 1788 he was at Tours, then joined his brother in Valenciennes, where he remained from February until April. After a visit to Brussels he met up with his brother at Koblenz and from there made excursions to Mayen, Bonn (where he was presented to the elector of Cologne), Aachen, D&uuml;sseldorf, and Maastricht, among other places. In October 1788 he became a volunteer in the Brunswick corps raised by Lieutenant-General Riedesel, his father's old comrade, which was acting with the Russian army in the Netherlands. In March 1791 he was transferred to the Grenadier Guards, promoted captain into the 15th regiment in April, and transferred back to the Grenadier Guards in November 1792. In January 1793, at the beginning of the war with France, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the duke of York (a post his brother was to hold three years later) and served on his personal staff throughout the disastrous campaigns in Flanders, being promoted brevet major on 22 April 1794. On 10 May he was severely wounded at Campin. He remained with the duke until he was promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 66th regiment on 30 September 1795, at which time he went to join his regiment in the West Indies.<br>
<br>Clinton was present at the landing in St Lucia under Sir Ralph Abercromby and at the siege and surrender of Morne Fortun&eacute;. In 1796, after having exchanged back into the Grenadier Guards, he sailed to England from San Domingo but <i>en route</i> was captured by a French cruiser and did not arrive home until the summer of 1797. In the following year he was made aide-de-camp to Lord Cornwallis in Ireland and was present at the surrender of the French force under General Humbert. He was attached to Lord William Bentinck's mission with General Suvorov in Italy during April 1799 when he was present at the battles of the Trebia and of Novi. On 23 December 1799 he married the Hon. Susan Charteris (1774&#150;1816), second daughter of Francis, seventh Lord Elcho; they had no children. She insisted on following him to Switzerland when he was appointed military assistant to William Wickham in 1800. In that year he was also employed on a mission to the Austrian army in Swabia and was present at the battles of Eugen and Moeskerch. He was appointed assistant adjutant-general in the eastern district in June 1801 and adjutant-general in India in January 1802, and was promoted colonel on 25 September 1803. George III at this time praised him and his brother as soldiers of &#145;uncommon abilities&#146;.<br>
<br>While in India, Clinton did good service in commanding the right wing at the battle of Laswari, but he left in March 1805. He next acted as military commissioner with the Russian general Kutuzov in the campaign of Austerlitz, and in July 1806 he embarked for Sicily as commander of the flank companies of the guards. He commanded the garrison of Syracuse from December 1806 to November 1807, during which time he met Sir John Moore, who became a close friend. Clinton was promoted brigadier-general in January 1808 and, as such, accompanied Moore, to Sweden. On 21 August following he arrived in Portugal as adjutant-general to Sir Harry Burrard, but on the next day found himself under a new commander, Sir Hugh Dalrymple, whom he later described as &#145;unfit&#146; for the post  (H. Clinton to W. H. Clinton, 17 Oct 1808). When at last the command fell to Moore, Clinton was delighted, although he did not favour his friend's strategy in the Peninsula. Under Moore he proved himself a decisive deputy, but his imperiousness as a disciplinarian made him unpopular with some. According to one victim of Clinton's anger, Captain Cochrane, Clinton, in the presence of several other officers, &#145;loaded me with such a torrent of abuse as could not have been merited by the most &#147;worthless&#148; individual in the army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of a General Court Martial</span>, 8). In May 1809 Clinton unsuccessfully prosecuted Cochrane in a court martial for disobedience and neglect of duty, although his real motive was to clear himself of charges of unreasonable conduct towards Cochrane following the latter's complaint against him. Clinton took charge of the embarkation procedures on arrival at Corunna, but two days before the battle he was taken ill with dysentery and was replaced by his deputy, Colonel Anderson. After Moore's death he was the first person to defend Moore's proceedings, in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A few remarks &hellip; explanatory of the motives which guided the operations of the British army during the late short campaign in Spain</span>, which, along with two other publications by him, appeared in 1809. In that year he also acted as adjutant-general in Ireland. Before leaving for Sweden he had joined his brother as the duke of Newcastle's MP for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, having the previous year failed as Lord Elcho's candidate for the Haddington burghs. When present (which was not often) he voted with ministers, and against parliamentary reform and Roman Catholic relief, until his resignation from the Commons in 1818. (He never spoke in debate.)<br>
<br>After his promotion to the rank of major-general on 25 July 1810, Clinton asked to be sent to the Peninsula for active service. His request was granted, and in October 1811 he joined the duke of Wellington and was given the command of the 6th division. Although lacking the military abilities of Thomas Picton or Lowry Cole, he nevertheless made a competent general of division. After attacking the forts of Salamanca in June 1812, he played a conspicuous part in the battle that ensued on 22 July, when his division took the Arapiles valley following the failure of Pack's Portuguese troops. When Wellington went on to march against Joseph Bonaparte at Madrid, Clinton was entrusted with that section of the army that remained behind on the River Douro. He afterwards co-operated in the costly and unsuccessful siege of Burgos in the autumn of 1812. He was made a local lieutenant-general in April 1813 and on 29 July was created a KB for his services at the battle of Vitoria. In the early spring of 1813 he showed the first signs of the mysterious illness which was to plague him until his death. After a short period of convalescence in England he returned in time to command his division at the battles of the Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and the affairs of C&aacute;ceres and Tarbes.<br>
<br>At the conclusion of the war Clinton's services were amply rewarded. He received a gold cross and one clasp, and the order of the Tower and the Sword; was made colonel of the 1st battalion, 60th regiment; was promoted lieutenant-general on 4 June 1814; and was appointed inspector-general of infantry. On Napoleon's escape from Elba, Wellington applied for Clinton, who took command of the 3rd division, which was posted on the right centre at the battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815. In this position he suffered as much from the French artillery as did the other divisions in the centre, and he also had to resist many cavalry charges. After the battle he was made a knight of the orders of Maria Theresa, of St George of Russia, and of William of the Netherlands, and on 9 August 1815 he was made colonel of the 3rd regiment (the Buffs). Two months earlier his elder brother William had applied to the marquess of Hertford for a peerage for Clinton, in the process waiving his own claims for a barony. However, his words fell on deaf ears. During the occupation of France, Clinton commanded a division of the British contingent, and in the autumn of 1815 William visited him in Paris, where he regretted that his brother's former &#145;open cordiality&#146; towards him had been replaced by a formal &#145;courteous manner&#146;, which he attributed to Clinton's lengthy career as a commander of men.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1816 the Commons, for the third time, thanked Clinton for his military service&#151;on this occasion for his part at Waterloo&#151;and he was again present to acknowledge this honour. However, following the death of his devoted wife, Susan, on 17 August, his health deteriorated rapidly and he became a recluse. In the spring of 1817 he was said to be &#145;very ill&#146; at Lyons, and by 1819 his elder brother held out little hope for his recovery. In the previous year he had already resigned his seat on the grounds of ill health. The exact nature of his affliction is hard to determine, but he is known to have been severely asthmatic. He died at his country seat of Ashley Clinton, near Lymington, Hampshire, on 11 December 1829 and was buried with his wife in the parish church at Barkway, Hertfordshire. A memorial to him was erected in the church, alongside memorials to other members of the Clinton family.<br>
