<span class="headword">Andrewes, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1659), <span class="occ">financier and regicide</span>, was the son of Robert Andrewes of Feltham, Middlesex, a Plymouth adventurer and subscriber to the Massachusetts Bay Company, and his wife, Margaret. He was a member of the Leathersellers' Company (and its master in 1638&#150;9), and from 1631 ran a wholesale linen drapery business at the White Lion, Fish Street Hill, prospering sufficiently to become an undersharer in the farming of the customs. His marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Henry Bonwick of Horsley in Surrey brought them four surviving sons and one surviving daughter, as well as a number of children who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Andrewes came to prominence as a leading financier for the parliamentary side in the Civil War. As the conflict with the king developed, he became more and more involved with the opposition. When he was nominated for alderman for Tower ward in January 1642, there was some trouble about his unwillingness to take the oath of supremacy and allegiance, but he was eventually sworn in, and moved to represent Aldgate ward in 1649. As the war developed he took on many treasurerships for the army and parliament, becoming one of the treasurers for war in 1645 as well as a commissioner for the customs in 1643. He advanced large sums to parliament and later invested heavily on his own account in the purchase of bishops' lands. With Maurice Thompson and Samuel Moyer he was involved in trading ventures with west Africa, which brought him into competition with the East India Company, but he went on to become the company's deputy governor in 1657 and its governor in 1659.<br>
<br>Andrewes was nominated in January 1649 to the high court of justice for the trial of Charles I; he did not attend the early stages of the court, but in the trial week he attended busily, and was in the group of commissioners who stood up to pass the sentence of death on Saturday 27 January [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Although he did not sign the king's death warrant, he was present at his execution. Shortly afterwards, he served on a high court of justice for the trial and condemnation of James, first duke of Hamilton, and others. He remained a leader of the City. He stepped in at mid-term to become the first lord mayor under the Commonwealth in April 1649 and served a full year in 1650&#150;51; he was a firm supporter of Oliver Cromwell and republicanism in the moderate City government in the fifties. He and his son Nathaniel both acquired sequestered properties; in Thomas Andrewes's case, that of Mucking Hall in Essex, of which he was the tenant. He was knighted by Cromwell in 1657. The date and place of his death are not known though it is recorded that he was buried on 20 August 1659. A year later, the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span> exempted Andrewes from pardon in respect of his lands, goods, and all rights of properties.<br>
