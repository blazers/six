<span class="headword">O'Leary,  John</span>  (1830&#150;1907), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and journalist</span>, was born in Tipperary town, Ireland, on 23 July 1830, the eldest child of John O'Leary (<i>d</i>. 1848), merchant, and Margaret Ryan (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1835), the second of his three wives. He was educated at the fashionable protestant Tipperary grammar school and at the age of fifteen entered the Catholic boarding-school Carlow College. A tall, austere, imposing figure, he was admired for his intellect, integrity, and loyalty. In summer 1846 he met James Stephens, the future leader of the Fenians. In common with other young liberal-minded Catholics he identified with the views advocated by Thomas Davis, and after entering Trinity College, Dublin, in 1847 to study law, he attended meetings of the Grattan Club presided over by Thomas Francis Meagher and supported the policies of John Mitchel in 1848. In November 1848 he was detained for two or three weeks as a suspect in the plot to rescue William Smith O'Brien. At this time he made the acquaintance of Thomas Clarke Luby, who like Stephens became a lifelong friend. O'Leary's characteristic political creed&#151;contempt for Irish politicians' agitation at Westminster; dislike of clerical influence in politics; a wish to convert wealthy protestants to nationalism; and a belief in Irish separatism&#151;were formed between mid-1847 and the end of 1849.<br>
<br>On the death of his father O'Leary inherited property in Tipperary town, yielding approximately &pound;200 per year. At the beginning of the same year he had entered the new Queen's College, Cork, to study medicine. In autumn 1850 he moved to the Queen's College, Galway, on being awarded a scholarship, remaining there until 1853 when he proceeded to Dublin in order to attend surgery classes at Meath Hospital. In 1854 he went to study medicine in London and then in 1855 migrated to Paris where he continued his medical education. In Paris, O'Leary established a circle of friends which included the American painter James McNeill Whistler. Late in 1856 he returned to London and then went to Dublin in summer 1857, spending the next year at the Meath Hospital once more. In March 1859 he was again in Paris, having probably given up his intention to practise medicine around this time, though he later claimed that it was only when he became editor of the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> (in 1863) that he finally abandoned the profession.<br>
<br>During 1858, O'Leary established, via Stephens, his &#145;first direct connection with Fenianism&#146;  (O'Leary, 1.85). This close link led Stephens to persuade a reluctant O'Leary, who was not a republican, to visit the United States in order to secure funds for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He sailed in April 1859, returning to Europe in September. While in New York, he turned his hand to journalism with the <span class="italic">Phoenix</span> and travelled extensively. Between 1860 and 1863 he took little part in politics, but then Stephens induced him to come to Dublin and become editor of the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, the new Fenian weekly newspaper, at a salary of &pound;150 per annum. In this venture he was closely associated with Luby, Charles J. Kickham, and Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa among others. During this time O'Leary was the chief financial officer to the revolutionary movement. This, politically and personally his most satisfying period, is described at length in <span class="italic">Recollections of Fenians and Fenianism</span> (1896).<br>
<br>The newspaper was suppressed after ninety-five issues on 16 September 1865. O'Leary was convicted in December of treason-felony by a special commission and sentenced to twenty years' penal servitude. Most of his confinement was spent in Portland prison, where he was obliged to work in the quarries. He regarded the notorious protests of his fellow inmate O'Donovan Rossa against the prison regime as undignified for a political prisoner. On 21 January 1871 he was released, but he was not allowed to return to the United Kingdom, and except for short trips to the United States and one brief sojourn in Tipperary he lived in Paris until 1885. During his long residence there O'Leary acquired a reputation as a letter writer. He continued to uphold the separatist cause, opposing the &#145;skirmishing fund&#146; to promote terrorist acts in Great Britain, rejecting the &#145;new departure&#146; between the militant wing of the Home Rule Party and the Fenians, and also criticizing the land war (1879&#150;82). The land war (and later the Plan of Campaign, from 1886 to 1891, which he opposed) caused a drop in his rental income, and for considerable periods thereafter he faced financial stringency.<br>
<br>Following passage of the amnesty act O'Leary returned to Dublin on 21 January 1885 where, for all but brief periods, he remained for the rest of his life, living with his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20701/', "Ellen O'Leary")</script> until her death in 1889. After his release he was active in promoting the separatist ideal and also played a prominent role in literary circles. At this time William Butler Yeats came under his spell, seeing himself later as &#145;a nationalist of the school of John O'Leary&#146;  (Bourke, 187). O'Leary raised funds for the publication of Yeats's <span class="italic">The Wanderings of Oisin</span> (1888). He was a founder of the Contemporary Club (1885/6), became a patron of the Gaelic Athletic Association (1886), helped form the Pan-Celtic literary group (1888), regularly visited the Southwark Literary Club, and accepted the presidency of the National Literary Society of Ireland. Although he favoured an Irish literature that was Irish in content, he was apathetic towards the Irish language, and ignored the Gaelic League.<br>
<br>Always a fierce critic of parliamentarianism, O'Leary nevertheless admired Charles Stewart Parnell, whom he had first met in the late 1870s; he supported the fallen leader during the Irish party split of 1890 to 1891, and was co-opted onto the Parnell Leadership Committee. In spite of being a bookish man and having engaged in journalism for periods, O'Leary wrote little (authoring only three pamphlets between 1885 and 1895), until during the early 1890s he prepared his <span class="italic">Recollections of Fenians and Fenianism</span>, published in 1896. He helped form the Young Ireland League in 1895, was active in the '98 celebrations, and was president of the Irish Transvaal Committee during the South African War. His last half-sibling died in 1898 and his own health deteriorated from 1901. He continued to support the old causes until he died on 16 March 1907, virtually penniless. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery with a Celtic cross placed over his grave, beside his old friend James Stephens. In 1913 Yeats penned what remains O'Leary's epitaph:<blockquote>
<div>Romantic Ireland's dead and gone,<br>
</div>
<div>It's with O'Leary in the grave.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 1.503)</blockquote>A bachelor, he bequeathed an extensive collection of books and pictures to the National Literary Society.<br>
