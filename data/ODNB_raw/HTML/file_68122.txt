<span class="headword">Hardisty,  Roger Michael</span>  (1922&#150;1997), <span class="occ">haematologist</span>, was born on 19 September 1922 in Finchley, Middlesex, the only child of William Henry Hardisty (1878&#150;1938), insurance assessor, and his wife, Ada Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodcock (1882&#150;1972). Educated at Oundle School and at St Thomas's Hospital medical school, London, he qualified in 1944. After house appointments he did his national service, mostly in Germany and Denmark, as medical officer to the Welsh Guards and the British mission in Denmark. While stationed in Hamburg he met his future wife Jytte Jarnum (<i>b</i>. 1924), of Copenhagen. They married on 24 March 1947 and had two children, Jan Botli, later a photographer, and Jocelyn Sandra, later a music teacher. Following the completion of his national service Hardisty returned to work as a junior clinical pathologist at St Thomas's. He became MRCP in 1949 and proceeded MD in 1950. In 1950&#150;51 he held a University of London travelling scholarship to Arhus, Denmark.<br>
<br>From 1956 to 1958 Hardisty was senior lecturer in clinical pathology at the Welsh National Medical School in Cardiff. In 1958, despite having had no formal training in paediatrics, he was appointed consultant haematologist at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London. Over the next thirty years he built up the first paediatric haematology department in Britain. This rapidly acquired an international reputation, and Hardisty trained many young paediatric haematologists from Britain and overseas. His own interests were in platelets, both in haemostasis and in initiating the processes that lead to the formation of a blood clot. In addition he ran a major centre for the treatment of haemophilia and similar disorders, and he also became involved in the management of childhood leukaemia.<br>
<br>By the time Hardisty was appointed to Great Ormond Street it was known that leukaemia might respond to treatment with drugs such as steroids or antimetabolites. Nevertheless, the disease inevitably recurred within a short period. The suggestion was then made that a positive response might be prolonged if more than one drug was administered at a time, and even that carefully controlled schedules might eventually produce cures. Hardisty became one of the prime movers in the development of clinical trials to determine the best combination of agents, serving first as secretary and then as chairman of the Medical Research Council's working party on childhood leukaemia. The initial difficulties were formidable: the toxic effects of the drugs added to the miseries of the disease, which might anyway recur a few months later in another guise&#151;as a lump in the testicle or ovary, for instance, or as leukaemic meningitis (which Hardisty was the first to describe). As a result both the parents and the medical carers of the children involved were sometimes reluctant to have them treated with the new agents. Nevertheless, Hardisty showed the same attributes as his pioneering colleagues in transplantation surgery, termed &#145;the courage to fail&#146;. His humane but obsessive persistence was rewarded when a trial disclosed that 70 per cent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had survived long term. Another reward came at his retirement in 1987: a secretly organized tea party held in the Great Ormond Street boardroom attended by many survivors from leukaemia.<br>
<br>Hardisty was also highly influential in the development of the wider aspects of the emerging new specialism of clinical haematology. He was a founder member and later president of two societies in the field, as well as vice-president of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The co-author of two notable books, <span class="italic">Bleeding Disorders: Investigation and Management</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">Blood and its Disorders</span> (1974), he was an outstanding editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Haematology</span>. He loved pellucid prose, and would spend hours revising his own and his juniors' drafts (and shunned the reprehensible but common practice of gift authorship&#151;the mere addition of the chief of department's name to papers with which he had not been directly concerned). He could also conduct seminars in Danish and French (for example, during his sabbatical as visiting professor at the University of Paris in 1978&#150;9), and the French government made him a <i>chevalier</i> of the national Order of Merit in 1988.<br>
<br>Hardisty was quintessentially a Thomas's intellectual&#151;irreverent, disdaining the then division between juniors and consultants, wearing bright clothes, and respecting the primacy of the National Health Service. Above all, throughout his life he saw research, followed by more research, as the priority. His outside interests were in photography, the theatre and music (Sir Thomas Beecham being a lifelong hero), travel, and food and wine. Although he continued some research into platelets as emeritus professor at the Royal Free Hospital, London, after retirement, he also devoted much time to bookbinding, which he took up with the same obsession that he had formerly devoted to his department. He died of stomach cancer at his home, 4 Ruskin Close, Hampstead, London, on 18 September 1997, and was cremated seven days later. He was survived by his wife, two children, and four grandchildren.<br>
