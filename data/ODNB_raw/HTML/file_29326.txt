<span class="headword">Whittingham,  Charles</span>  (1767&#150;1840), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born on 16 June 1767 at Stoke Farm, Caludon or Calledon, near Coventry, Warwickshire, the seventh child of Charles Whittingham, farmer, and his wife, Mary. On 25 March 1779 he was apprenticed to Richard Bird, printer and bookseller of Coventry; having completed his apprenticeship in the spring of 1786 he worked for a time in Birmingham before moving to London, where by 1789 he had set up on his own at 10 Dean Street, off Fetter Lane. Whittingham obtained his freedom of the Stationers' Company by redemption on 14 April 1795, and the freedom of the City of London on 6 October of the same year. Over the next few years he occupied various premises in the area of Fetter Lane, and in 1803 established a workshop at 10 Union Buildings, off Leather Lane. It was here that he installed several of the earliest iron Stanhope hand-presses, invented about 1800 and characterized by a large platen allowing an entire sheet to be printed at one impression. For about eight years his business used the imprint the Stanhope Press.<br>
<br>After a further move in 1807 to Goswell Street in Clerkenwell, Whittingham formed a partnership with Thomas Potts and Robert Bishop, capitalizing on Potts's patent for removing tar from old ropes and processing them into pulp for paper making. Premises for this operation were found in 1809 at Chiswick, 7 or 8 miles west of Whittingham's London printing office; within a year he had leased High House on the Chiswick Mall and moved his residence and part of his printing business to Chiswick as well. He left the London shop in the hands of his foreman Robert Rowland, taking him into partnership in 1810, but the London business was gradually given up, and the partnership terminated in 1819. Whittingham also entered into a partnership with the stationer and bookseller John Arliss from 1813 to 1817, and may have been the Whittingham of the ink-making firm of Whittingham and Scarlet, operating in Carnaby Street during the years 1804&#150;10.<br>
<br>By 1811, when Whittingham began on occasion to use the imprint the Chiswick Press, he had already built up a thriving business. His surviving account books, now in the British Library, show a steady progress after the first jobbing entries of 1792, which gradually give way to commissions for type specimen books for the Caslon foundry (1794&#150;6), almanacs and religious tracts printed by the thousands, and even a short-lived anti-Jacobin newspaper (<span class="italic">The Tomahawk! or, Censor General</span>, 1795&#150;6). In 1799 Whittingham produced on his own account an elegant <span class="italic">Poems</span> of Thomas Gray, immediately selling the whole edition to two booksellers and going on to print an entire series of neat, compact editions of such standard works as Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</span> (1800), John Gay's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1801), and James Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span> (1802). In 1803 he formed an association with the bookseller John Sharpe, and the two men jointly undertook the publication of several series: the <span class="roman">British Classics</span>, <span class="roman">Sharpe's British Theatre</span>, and the <span class="roman">British Poets</span>. Later, in 1822, Whittingham issued his own <span class="roman">British Poets</span> series in one hundred royal 18mo volumes; other of his series include <span class="roman">Whittingham's Pocket Novels</span>, <span class="roman">Whittingham's French Classics</span>, and <span class="roman">Whittingham's Cabinet Library</span>.<br>
<br>In his mature years, Whittingham acquired a considerable reputation as a printer of illustrated books. Samuel Jackson Pratt's <span class="italic">Pity's Gift</span> (1797) was his first book to feature wood-engraved illustrations, but it was not until he was established at Chiswick that his work began consistently to exhibit the sharpness and evenness of impression associated with his finest illustrated books: the two series of Northcote's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1829 and 1833), <span class="italic">The Tower Menagerie</span> (1829), <span class="italic">The Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society</span> (1830&#150;31), and <span class="italic">Puckle's Club</span> (1834). Whittingham has been credited with the innovation of using overlays, pieces of paper or thin card pasted to the tympan for the delicate regulation of the amount of pressure applied to various parts of a wood-engraving, but it is doubtful that he was the first to use this technique. Such technical improvements as the iron Stanhope press, the composition inking roller, and smooth, machine-made paper also contributed to the success of Whittingham's woodblock printing, and he is reputed to have manufactured his own printing ink.<br>
<br>Family tradition represents Whittingham as a charitable if severe man, a strict sabbatarian and a strong-willed disciplinarian. Although he married a Mary Mead, who predeceased him, no children (if there were any) survived to adulthood. In 1810 he took <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29327/', "Charles Whittingham (1795&#150;1876)")</script>, his older brother's son, into his business, first as an apprentice and later as a journeyman, and then as a partner from 1824 until 1828, when the younger man moved to London and set up his own printing shop. The Whittingham residence and business was moved about 1818 to the river-front College House at the corner of Chiswick Mall and Chiswick Lane; Whittingham the elder remained there after the departure of his nephew, continuing to print until his health failed in early 1838. On 24 July 1839 he entered into an agreement with his nephew, where, in return for the guarantee of an annuity of &pound;358, Whittingham the elder agreed to hand over the goodwill, types, presses, and fixtures to his nephew, provided that the latter secured a bond of &pound;1000 against possible bankruptcy. On 5 January 1840 Charles Whittingham the elder died at his Chiswick home, leaving his business to his nephew and bequeathing substantial sums to the Stationers' Company, the Printers' Pension Society (which founded special pensions bearing his name), and the poor of Chiswick. He was buried at Chiswick.<br>
