<span class="headword">Dawkins,  Rowland</span>  (1618&#150;1691), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and deputy major-general</span>, was born at Kilvrough (or Cil-frwch), Pennard, Glamorgan, the eldest son of George Dawkins (<i>fl</i>. 1600&#150;1640), a minor gentleman, and Elizabeth, the daughter of the serjeant-at-law William Glyn of Clynnog Fawr, Caernarvonshire. In September 1643, a year after the civil war had broken out, Dawkins suffered the attentions of royalist sequestrators; and he became active on behalf of parliament when Philip Jones became governor of Swansea in 1645. Later that year Dawkins joined the Glamorgan county committee, with the rank of major-general of the garrison troops commanded by Jones. He was present at the battle of St Fagans on 8 May 1648, and became governor of Carmarthen and Tenby the same year. He was unpopular in Haverfordwest for attempting to billet troops there instead of Tenby, which had successfully claimed relief on grounds of its poverty. In 1649 and 1650 Dawkins was added to the Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire committees, and he was a commissioner under the <span class="roman">Act for the Propagation of the Gospel</span> from February 1650. In this body he was very active in letting tithes to laymen to fund the itinerant ministry of Walter Cradock, Vavasor Powell, and other separatist ministers, and he himself rented the tithes of Bishopston, in the Gower, in 1651. He was also, with others in a joint purchase, able to buy crown lands in Pembrokeshire, Monmouthshire, and Carmarthenshire. These had been made available to Philip Jones's garrison regiment, of which Dawkins was a prominent member.<br>
<br>In June 1651 Dawkins ended a royalist revolt in Cardiganshire, and was appointed a commissioner of the high court of justice to try the rebels. As governor of Carmarthen he was a natural choice as MP for the county in 1654, and shortly after his election he became a commissioner for scandalous ministers in south Wales. Dawkins, Philip Jones, Bussy Mansel, and John Price&#151;all from Glamorgan&#151;in effect ran south Wales for the Commonwealth (and later for the protectorate), by virtue of dominating the various committees appointed to provide governance.<br>
<br>With a high profile in local administration, and a county military background, Dawkins was again naturally chosen for leadership of the militia in March 1655, when the government sought to put in place a higher level of security against royalist insurgency. As commander of its militia, Dawkins was <i>de facto</i> major-general for south Wales when in October 1655 no commission was issued specifically for the region. In January 1656, with the rank of colonel, he was confirmed as one of two deputy major-generals under James Berry, whose territory included all Wales and border English counties. Unsurprisingly, in view of the extent of Berry's responsibilities, Dawkins retained his leadership of the military, and was active in supervising the new round of sequestrations and in curbing disorderly meetings in south Wales.<br>
<br>Elected again for Carmarthenshire in 1656, Dawkins proved in parliament a loyal supporter of the protector, but the non-renewal of commissions to the major-generals reduced his power. In 1659 he failed to achieve re-election to parliament at Carmarthen, but sat for Cardigan Boroughs instead. After the collapse of the Protectorate of Richard Cromwell, Dawkins lost his command of the South Wales militia, was temporarily omitted from county committees, and failed to secure a parliamentary seat. After the Restoration he was removed from the corporation of Swansea, where he had been senior alderman from 1656, and was summoned to the consistory court of St David's for not having his children baptized. Unlike some other former &#145;propagators&#146; such as Philip Jones, Dawkins did not conform to the Church of England after 1660. He had been active in approving ministers for the state church during the interregnum, but was hostile to Quakers and was never, either before or after 1660, a member of the celebrated Baptist congregation at Ilston, Gower, near his home. In 1677 he was listed by Sir Edward Mansel as one who had &#145;raised his fortune in the late time&#146;, worth &pound;250 a year  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/398, 283&#150;4). During the 1680s he recovered his place on the Glamorgan bench of magistrates, but was detained at Chepstow as a suspect during Monmouth's rising in 1685. The duke of Beaufort, who employed Dawkins as his steward, noted him in 1687 as still a protestant dissenter. He died on 7 May 1691 and was buried at Pennard church. The date of his marriage to Mary Bowen is unknown.<br>
