</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Laing,  David</span>  (1793&#150;1878), <span class="occ">antiquary and librarian</span>, was born in North St David Street, Edinburgh, on or shortly after 20 April 1793, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15893/', "William Laing (1764&#150;1832)")</script> and Helen Kirk (1767&#150;1837). His father, by profession a publisher and bookseller specializing in secondhand, antiquarian, and foreign literature, was ultimately to have twelve children, nine of whom, four sons and five daughters, survived until adulthood. Laing was educated at the Canongate grammar school between about 1800 and 1805, and thereafter attended Greek classes at Edinburgh University, but these formal studies ended when in 1806, at the age of thirteen, he began work in his father's thriving business, recently moved to 49 South Bridge. Laing made the most of this change in circumstance, reading as much of the stock as he could, with Scottish history and literature proving a particular passion. The learning he thus acquired, and his youthful enthusiasm, soon came to the notice of the many literary people who found Laing's shop an irresistible attraction. He attended several important London auction sales, such as the Porson (1809) and Roxburghe (1812); and, following his father's example, made purchasing trips on the continent in 1816 and 1819. The latter visit was to Scandinavia, and it was on this occasion that he purchased around 1500 items from the library of the Icelandic scholar Gr&iacute;mur Thorkelin, a collection later to be sold to the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. The 1816 journey, to the Low Countries and northern France, was undertaken in the company of Adam Black and James Wilson (brother of &#145;Christopher North&#146;), and when in Holland he made the acquaintance of John Gibson Lockhart. Lockhart referred to Laing in a poem published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> in July 1818 as:<blockquote>
<div>the most sagacious and the best,<br>
</div>
<div>As all Old Reekie's erudites opine,<br>
</div>
<div>Of Scottish Bibliopoles &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>A famous Bibliomaniac, and a shrewd,<br>
</div>
<div>Who turns his madness to no little good.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, 407)</blockquote>The following year Lockhart, in <span class="italic">Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk</span> (letter 43, 2.182) again praised Laing, describing him as &#145;by far the most genuine specimen of the true old-fashioned bibliopole that I ever saw exhibited in the person of a young man&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1819 Laing was a candidate for the vacant keepership of the Advocates' Library, but, despite support for Laing from Walter Scott, Dr David Irving was elected in 1820. Laing's youth no doubt counted against him, but another likely factor was his close links with William Blackwood and his circle, whose satirical writings infuriated many. Laing made a second attempt to become keeper of the Advocates' Library after Irving's retirement in 1848, but withdrew his application, and the post went to Samuel Halkett.<br>
<br>In 1821 Laing became a partner in his father's business. In that same year he issued the first results of his deep love of early Scottish poetry: an edition of the poems of Alexander Scott; an edition (with David Irving) of the poems of Alexander Montgomerie; and the first part of <span class="italic">Select Remains of the Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland</span>. From then on, publications, mainly editions of Scottish historical and literary material, poured from him unabated until his death.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1823 Sir Walter Scott founded the Bannatyne Club, for the purpose of printing hitherto unpublished or long out-of-print material relating to the history and literature of Scotland. Membership was restricted to thirty-one members. Scott was president until his death, and Laing became the first and only secretary, seeing through to publication well over a hundred volumes, at least thirty-nine of which were edited or part-edited by himself, before the society was dissolved in 1861. It was Laing who held the club together and saw that the publication schedule did not flag, either for want of editorial industry or dearth of patrons, as well as ensuring that the clubbable aspects of membership were kept green.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1824 Laing was elected to a fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, having been blackballed at an earlier attempt in 1820. In 1827 his application to become a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh was likewise blackballed, but here he never allowed his name to go forward for re-election, although encouraged to do so. As with the Bannatyne Club, Laing was of inestimable importance to the Society of Antiquaries: for over fifty years there was scarcely a volume of the society's publications to which he did not provide a contribution, and it has been estimated he read over one hundred papers to the society. He helped to edit the society's irregular <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and was joint editor of the annual <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> from their first appearance in 1851/2 until his death. As treasurer between 1836 and 1852 he steered the society through a particularly difficult period, when it seemed possible that its museum might have to be sold to meet debts. The situation was resolved when the government undertook in 1851 to maintain the collections, an important step towards the formation of a national museum of antiquities. Laing was also a vice-president (1859&#150;62 and 1865&#150;8), acting secretary (1839&#150;41), and a secretary for foreign correspondence (1852&#150;78).<br>
<br>Throughout the 1820s and most of the 1830s Laing continued as a bookseller. Between 1825 and 1827 he also found time to supervise the rebinding of older books and to help with the rearrangement of stock in the university library, at that time moving premises. On 21 June 1837 he was elected librarian to the Society of Writers to H. M. Signet, the professional body for Scottish solicitors, in succession to Macvey Napier. His candidature was supported by many luminaries, such as Robert Southey, T. F. Dibdin, John Lee, Sir William Hamilton, J. G. Lockhart, Sir Henry Ellis, and Sir Frederic Madden. Thereafter, Laing gave up his bookselling business, as he undertook to do in his letter of application, selling at auction the stock he did not want for his personal library. The Signet Library when Laing took over had 40,000 volumes; when he died forty-one years later, still in office, it had 70,000. Laing masterminded the production of a printed catalogue of the holdings: the volume covering A-L appeared in 1871, and letter P was reached by 1878.<br>
<br>Laing's own library became very large and impressive. The printed books possibly numbered 20,000 by his death, despite the sale of over 1200 items at auction in London in June 1856. His massive manuscript collections contained much highly important literary and historical material, mainly of Scottish interest, and including 3326 charters, mainly of Scottish provenance, as well as over 120 medieval manuscript volumes. He also collected old master prints and drawings, portraits of Scots, and other items of Scottish historical importance. He undoubtedly used continental visits, especially frequent in the 1850s, as well as travels within Britain, to build up his collections, but also used every opportunity nearer to home, including arrangements with at least one Edinburgh waste paper merchant.<br>
<br>Laing lived an equable bachelor existence, blessed with robust good health, with a wide circle of friends, acquaintances, and correspondents, although to strangers on first acquaintance he could appear brusque, testy, and impatient. He gave freely of his time to help other scholars, and Cosmo Innes declared in 1864 that &#145;no wise man will undertake a literary work in Scotland without taking counsel with Mr David Laing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 21 April 1864). David Masson declared Laing to be &#145;the prince of the Scottish literary antiquarians of this century&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 30 Oct 1878). Laing's principal biographer, Gilbert Goudie, listed Laing's publications in 1913: they number 214, although some multi-volume works received entries for each volume. On the other hand, some anonymous notices, articles, and reviews no doubt slipped through Goudie's net. Laing not only edited material for, and involved himself in the affairs of, the Bannatyne Club and the Society of Antiquaries, but he also performed editorial and organizational work for the plethora of Scottish historical clubs which sprouted in emulation of the Bannatyne, such as its Glasgow equivalent the Maitland Club, and the Abbotsford, Spalding, Hunterian, and Wodrow clubs. For the last-named Laing undertook his most important work, an edition of the writings of John Knox which appeared in six volumes between 1846 and 1864, although the club itself collapsed in 1848. No collected edition has appeared since. Many of Laing's other editions are likewise still the most accessible and accurate available, for example his edition of the letters of Robert Baillie (Maitland and Bannatyne clubs, 1841) or his edition of the diary of Alexander Brodie (Spalding Club, 1853). Laing's editorial methods were of the highest calibre according to the standards of his day, and Scottish literary and historical scholars owe him an immense debt of gratitude.<br>
<br>Laing's knowledge of Scottish art was on a par with his acquaintance of Scottish history and literature, a fact recognized in 1854, when he was elected honorary professor of antiquities to the Royal Scottish Academy; in 1861 he became honorary professor of ancient history there. In 1862 he declined an LLD from St Andrews University, but he accepted the same degree from Edinburgh University two years later. In 1865 Thomas Carlyle, an old friend, was elected rector of Edinburgh University, and Laing was nominated by him his assessor to the university court for the three-year period concerned.<br>
<br>Following his mother's death in January 1837, Laing's youngest sister, Euphemia, acted as housekeeper. Until 1843 he stayed at the family home of Ramsay Lodge, Lauriston Place, but from 1845 he lived at East Villa, 12 James Street, Portobello, to the east of Edinburgh. It was there he died, on Friday 18 October 1878, of kidney failure. He was buried in the family plot in the new Calton cemetery on 23 October.<br>
<br>Laing's collections had varying fates: the manuscripts, including his own correspondence comprising some 9000 items, were bequeathed to Edinburgh University Library. By his express testamentary direction, his printed books were sold by auction in London: Messrs Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge conducted the sale between 1 December 1879 and 24 February 1881. The same firm also sold Laing's finest prints on 21 February 1880. Altogether, there were 11,743 lots of books and 213 of prints, and the total amount realized was almost &pound;17,000. A Scottish bibliophile of the next generation, David Murray, called the dispersal of Laing's library &#145;a national misfortune&#146;  (Murray, 362). Laing's impressive collection of old master drawings were bequeathed to the Royal Scottish Academy, whence they were later transferred to the National Gallery of Scotland. A large residue of prints and drawings, the latter mainly Scottish and dating from after 1800, were sold at auction in Edinburgh: the drawings in 347 lots on 22 and 23 December 1879; and the prints in two sales, 16&#150;19 December 1879 and 13 January 1880.<br>
