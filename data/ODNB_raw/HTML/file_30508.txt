<span class="headword">Aylward,  Gladys May</span>  (1902&#150;1970), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 24 February 1902 in Edmonton, Middlesex, the eldest of the three children of Thomas John Aylward, postman, and his wife, Rosina Florence Whiskin, daughter of a surgical boot maker. After receiving an elementary education, at the age of fourteen she became a shop-girl, then a children's nanny, settling finally to be a parlourmaid. She was efficient and pleasant, liked frequent moves, and served in several well-known households in the West End of London.<br>
<br>Gladys Aylward's father, who had been vicar's warden of St Aldhelm's Church, Edmonton, had joined a nearby gospel mission when she was nine; the Aylwards were brought up as active Christians, and in London a youth movement soon absorbed her free evenings to the exclusion of an earlier interest in the stage. In December 1929 she was accepted for missionary training by the China Inland Mission, which had been founded in 1865 partly to provide opportunity for men and women of strong faith but indifferent education; however, she was soon rejected as a willing yet hopeless student. Still intent on China, Gladys Aylward worked in the slums of Bristol and Swansea until she nearly died of double pneumonia. Back in Edmonton for convalescence, depressed by her failure to reach China, she went reluctantly with her mother to a Primitive Methodist meeting at Wood Green. Here she heard that a widowed Mrs Jeannie Lawson, an elderly member of a small independent mission in north China, needed a helper who must find her own way out.<br>
<br>Gladys Aylward returned home that evening a different woman. She became a parlourmaid again to save money for the cheapest fare, by the Trans-Siberian Railway. In an incident afterwards made famous on film, she sat in an attic room in the South Kensington home of the daughter of Sir Francis Younghusband and put her few coppers on the bed and prayed: &#145;Oh God! Here's me. Here's my <span class="roman">Bible</span>, here's my money! Use us, God! Use us!&#146;  (Burgess, rev. edn, 18).<br>
<br>On 15 October 1932 Gladys left Liverpool Street Station for China. She needed all her cockney wit and pluck to survive the passage through the Soviet Union, and reached north China via Japan to join Mrs Lawson, a prickly, unpredictable Scot, in the country town of Yangsheng, Shansi province.<br>
<br>They opened an inn for muleteers as a means of evangelism. There Gladys Aylward learned Chinese by ear rather than by book. After her patron's death the mandarin made her inspector of feet, in the campaign against female foot binding, a post which gave her openings everywhere. With her tiny size (she was but 5 feet tall) and very dark brown hair, her humour, and entire lack of colour or cultural prejudice, she became a greatly loved and masterly story-teller of simple Christianity: the Jesus of Gladys Aylward was real and alive, to be talked to and consulted at every turn.<br>
<br>Known as Ai Weh-te&#151;the nearest the Chinese could get to Aylward and which meant, felicitously, &#145;the virtuous one&#146;&#151;Gladys became a Chinese citizen in 1936. Her best-known exploit, during the Japanese war, was in 1940 to lead 100 children through hardships and dangers to safety across the Yellow River. At Fufeng she fell dangerously ill, and on partial recovery worked as a <span class="roman">Bible</span>-woman and among lepers. In 1949 she was given passage money, and returned to England after seventeen years.<br>
<br>Gladys Aylward, whose adventures and achievements in China could be equalled by other missionaries, might have remained unknown had not her mother alerted Hugh Redwood, the celebrated religious journalist, who sent reporters to meet her. This led a BBC writer, Alan Burgess, to contact Gladys Aylward and dramatize her story on radio. In 1952 a publisher heard a repeat of the programme and suggested that Burgess should write a popular biography. His fictionalized <span class="italic">The Small Woman</span> (1957) became a best-seller and later a memorable and moving film, <span class="italic">The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</span> (1959). This she tried to stop and refused to see, because of the fictional love interest and her portrayal by a divorcee, Ingrid Bergman.<br>
<br>Book and film together made Gladys Aylward eminent, the archetype of the selfless, dedicated woman of faith, brushing away hardships and danger as she had once brushed crumbs from her employers' tables. Gladys Aylward, more than many of her generation, brought the Christian missionary ideal before the general public.<br>
<br>Gladys Aylward's last twelve years, apart from speaking tours, were spent in Taiwan. There her trusting nature made her the victim of embezzlement by the husband of an adopted daughter who helped her run an orphanage. She saved him from execution but attracted much unpopularity for putting temptation in his way. None the less, she lived it down, still the same uninhibited woman, intensely concerned about the poor and sinful, making Christianity vividly alive, with complete contempt for all she thought was wrong.<br>
<br>Gladys Aylward died in Taibei (Taipei) after a few hours' illness on 1 January 1970. The Chinese buried her in a marble tomb in the hilltop garden of Christ's College, Tamsui (Danshui), overlooking the estuary and facing mainland China.<br>
