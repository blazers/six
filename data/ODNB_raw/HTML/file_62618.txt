<span class="headword">Shipman,  David Herbert</span>  (1932&#150;1996), <span class="occ">film historian</span>, was born on 4 November 1932 at Lyndale, Waldemar Avenue, Upper Hellesdon, Norwich, the younger child and only son of Alfred Herbert Shipman (1898&#150;1981), a commercial traveller in electrical appliances, and his wife, Ethel May Deakes (1903&#150;1988), clerical worker and daughter of a piano-tuner. Both parents were Londoners, and the family moved back to the capital, to Eltham, in 1940, only for the children to be evacuated in the following year to Pensilva, Cornwall. David was educated variously at primary schools in London, then, on a junior county scholarship, at Callington county school, Cornwall, where he spent &#145;some of the happiest years of my life&#146;  (Shipman). With the end of the Second World War he went to Shooters Hill grammar school, which he left in 1949, aged sixteen, after taking his school certificate, to become a clerk in the architects' office of the London county council.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</span> (1937), seen on holiday in Great Yarmouth when he was five, was the film that ignited Shipman's cine-enthusiasm, but he might have been condemned to the &#145;sheer boredom&#146;  (Shipman) of town-planning paper pushing had it not been for national service. In 1951, against his will, he joined the RAF, on the clerical side, and in its democratic conviviality discovered a self-confidence that he never, despite many buffets and supposed buffets, entirely lost. The following year he spent in Singapore, in Changi, where an RAF chaplain, the Revd James Tinline, introduced him to the films of Greta Garbo and the Marx brothers, and persuaded him to take three A-levels and try for Oxford University. Shipman went up to Merton College in 1954 to read English and, although he failed his first-year preliminary examination twice and was sent down after only one year, he enjoyed himself thoroughly. He acted and sat on the Film Society committee, he fell in love with Judy Garland, and he had found a way out.<br>
<br>For the next ten years Shipman worked as a publisher's representative, first on staff, for Victor Gollancz, Methuen, and the Curtis Publishing Company, and after 1963 as a freelance, for Paul Hamlyn, Hale, and Panther. His favourite years were from 1961 to 1963, when he lived in Paris for Curtis, acting as European representative for Bantam Books, and travelled the continent, returning, sometimes just for a night, to London for performances at the National Film Theatre. In 1962 he started contributing to the magazine <span class="italic">Films and Filming</span>. In December 1964 he met Felix Otto Brenner (<i>b</i>. 1923), the New York-born art director of Hamlyn, who was to be his partner for the rest of his life. He moved into Brenner's London flat, at 2 Callow Street, Chelsea, in March 1965, and in September he gave up travelling. In 1968, with an editor from Hamlyn, he hatched the plot of his first great work, <span class="italic">The Great Movie Stars</span>, published in two volumes as <span class="italic">The Golden Years</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">The International Years</span> (1973); a follow-up volume, <span class="italic">The Independent Years</span>, appeared in 1991. In 1982&#150;4, again in two volumes, appeared the book of which he was proudest, initially commissioned in 1972 by Phaidon to be a companion to Ernst Gombrich's <span class="italic">The Story of Art</span> (1950): <span class="italic">The Story of Cinema: an Illustrated History</span>, a vast compendium, from <span class="italic">Fred Ott's Sneeze</span> to <span class="italic">Missing</span>.<br>
<br>Before Shipman there had been <i>ad hoc</i> film critics aplenty, but few prepared to take the long view. The history of film was, after all, young; Shipman was to publish his centenary celebration <span class="italic">Cinema: the First Hundred Years</span> (1993) only three years before his death. Much cinema literature had been ephemeral, much of it hagiographical, much driven by the studios' marketing departments. Shipman, hailing Paul Rotha as his mentor, combined exceptional diligence and an original amateur's enthusiasm. He kept notes of every film he had ever seen (and refused to write critically of a film he had not). He was as much interested in studio history, budgets, salaries, and box-office returns as in individual actor filmographies. He was passionate about the stars he liked, imperiously acidulous about those he did not. He was a populist who was also devoted to the films of Satyajit Ray and Akira Kurosawa. His tours through star careers could be whirlwinds of excitement or brutal exercises in deprecation. He was for Marilyn Monroe (&#145;she glowed, like a moth in candlelight&#146;; <span class="italic">The International Years</span>, rev. edn, 1989, 398) and Buster Keaton; he was against Marlene Dietrich (&#145;Age does not wither her, nor custom stale her infinite sameness&#146;; <span class="italic">The Golden Years</span>, rev. edn, 1989, 166) and Alfred Hitchcock. His vigorous turn of phrase, his large sense of film context, and his independence of judgement marked him out among the swelling ranks of film encyclopaedists.<br>
<br>Shipman's big books never made him rich, and his publishers seemed reluctant, despite their persistent popularity, to keep them in print. This rankled with the author, who felt he had never been adequately recognized. He was a programme consultant to the National Film Theatre, lectured at the University of East Anglia and for the British Council, and served for eight years as film critic of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> and for eight as principal film obituarist of <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, but he necessarily derived his income from more ordinary output such as his books <span class="italic">The Good Film and Video Guide</span> (1984), <span class="italic">A Pictorial History of Science Fiction Films</span> (1985), <span class="italic">Caught in the Act: Sex and Eroticism in the Movies</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">Movie Talk: Who Said What about Whom in the Movies</span> (1988). He wrote two biographies, <span class="italic">Brando</span> (1974, enlarged as <span class="italic">Marlon Brando</span>, 1989) and <span class="italic">Judy Garland</span> (1992). He was working on a third, of Fred Astaire, when he died in his sleep of a heart attack at home, in the house that had been his mother's, 64 Woodlands, Overton, Hampshire, on 22 April 1996. He was cremated at Aldershot crematorium on 2 May.<br>
<br>David Shipman was outdatedly dapper in appearance, sometimes with a discreet beard, and liked a hat. Outside film his enthusiasms were theatre, opera (Maria Callas), pictures (the early Sienese), and travel. There was something eternally boyish about him. This was usually endearing, occasionally infuriating.<br>
