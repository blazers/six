<span class="headword">Ashby,  Thomas</span>  (1874&#150;1931), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at Ashford Road, Staines, Middlesex, on 14 October 1874, the only child of Thomas Ashby (1851&#150;1906), a member of the well-known Quaker family which owned Ashby's brewery at Staines, and his wife, Rose Emma, daughter of Apsley Smith. Young Ashby was an exhibitioner at Winchester College (1887&#150;93), where he was almost immediately dubbed with the lasting nickname Titus. In 1886 the Staines brewery became a private company, and in 1890, when Ashby was sixteen, his father settled in Rome, there to become an enthusiastic explorer of the Campagna and an associate of Rodolfo Lanciani. Learning and enthusiasm won Ashby a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a pupil of Francis John Haverfield and John Linton Myres; he was awarded a first-class degree in classical moderations (1895) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1897).<br>
<br>In 1897 Ashby was awarded a Craven fellowship, thereafter devoting himself to studies of Roman antiquities, on which he obtained the Oxford degree of DLitt (1905) and the Conington prize for classical learning (1906). His first article, &#145;The true site of Lake Regillus&#146;, was published in 1898. At this time the city of Rome was being transformed by a series of excavations: renewed work on the Roman forum had commenced in 1898 under Giacomo Boni. Ashby wrote a regular series of reports on these developments, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> (1899&#150;1906), and subsequently in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, and the <span class="italic">Antiquaries Journal</span> (1921&#150;5, 1930).<br>
<br>Ashby was the first student of the British School at Rome, enrolling in January 1902, under Gordon McNeil Rushforth, its first director. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and appointed honorary librarian of the school. Following Rushforth's early retirement due to ill health Ashby was appointed assistant director (1903) under Henry Stuart Jones. When Stuart Jones had to retire due to ill health (1905) Ashby continued as assistant director until 1906 when he was appointed director, a position he held until 1925. His first assistant director was Augustus Moore Daniel, who subsequently became director of the National Gallery in London. Ashby's position at the school was not always secure but it was strengthened in 1909 by the appointment of Eug&eacute;nie Strong as assistant director, who in effect served as hostess for the school, extending its influence in Roman society.<br>
<br>At this period foreign archaeologists were not permitted to excavate in Italy. This led to an emphasis on topographical and museum studies. Ashby himself produced a series of detailed topographical studies of the Roman roads of Italy, which were brought together in the valuable work <span class="italic">The Roman Campagna in classical times</span> (1927); this was republished in 1970 with an Italian edition in 1982. A second strand of Ashby's research was on the aqueducts of the city of Rome: his first study was published in the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span> (1900).<br>
<br>Ashby became a master of Rome's urban topography, and derived from early literature and prints a unique knowledge of the vicissitudes of the city's monuments and artistic treasures. While the former mastery was evinced by articles eventually running into hundreds, the latter was demonstrated by his treatment of such varied themes as Eufrosino della Volpaia's map of the Campagna (1547), the sixteenth-century architectural drawings of Antonio Labacco, the topographical studies of &Eacute;tienne du P&eacute;rac (1581), Giovanni Battista de'Cavalieri's <span class="italic">Antiquae statuae urbis Romae</span>, and the Windsor Castle, Soane Library, and Eton College collections of drawings and paintings.<br>
<br>Ashby gained experience of excavation at the Roman town of Caer-went in south Wales through the encouragement and support of Haverfield. This project, initiated by the Clifton Antiquarian Club, was organized under the title of the Caerwent Exploration Fund (1899&#150;1910, 1913), with Lord Tredegar as its president. Ashby worked with Alfred E. Hudd and A. Trice Martin, an assistant master at Clifton College, and he contributed to the annual reports which were published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1901&#150;7, 1909&#150;11).<br>
<br>Ashby sought to make the British School at Rome a focus for archaeological research in the western Mediterranean. Duncan Mackenzie, who had been working with Arthur Evans at Knossos, was appointed an associate student of the British School. Ashby and Mackenzie visited Sardinia together in June 1906, and later that summer presented a joint paper on the ethnology of the island to the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in York. This area of research was brought to a close in 1909 when Mackenzie returned to the eastern Mediterranean to work for the Palestine Exploration Fund. Ashby returned to Sardinia in 1912. Attention then turned to the British islands of Malta and Gozo which offered possibilities for research on the prehistory of the Mediterranean. He was joined for the 1905&#150;6 session by Thomas Eric Peet. Ashby made a series of visits to Malta in 1908 and 1909. In 1910 and 1911 he returned with Peet to excavate the sites of Hagiar-Kim and Mnaidra.<br>
<br>In 1912, with the support of the British ambassador, Sir Rennell Rodd, it was decided to expand and relocate the British School at Rome to a new, permanent building in the Valle Giulia, designed by Lutyens. This expansion allowed the school to embrace not only archaeology but also art and architecture when it moved to the new premises in 1915. During the First World War Ashby, with his Quaker leanings, volunteered for service in the first British Red Cross ambulance unit (1915). Though criticized for not fighting in the trenches, and asked to return to Rome where Mrs Strong was trying to run the school, he continued to serve initially as translator in the unit which was based at the Villa Trento near Udine, and was mentioned in dispatches for his intrepidity on the Asiago plateau while working with the Red Cross. Following the Italian defeat at Caporetto, Ashby served at the British Red Cross headquarters in Genoa from late 1917 to spring 1918. He then moved to Rome and undertook a role as an education officer, lecturing on ancient Rome to the troops.<br>
<br>Ashby resumed his role as director of the school in spring 1919. One of the immediate tasks was to resume, with Eug&eacute;nie Strong, the school's work on the sculpture catalogue initiated by Stuart Jones. Ashby returned to Malta in March 1921 to work with Themistocles Zammit at Hal-Tarxien; the work was published in the <span class="italic">Antiquaries Journal</span> (1924). Ashby continued his interest in prehistory by collaborating with Peet and H. Thurlow Leeds on an essay on the western Mediterranean for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span> (1924). On his return from Malta, in spring 1921, Ashby met Caroline May, eldest daughter of Richard Price-Williams, civil engineer, who had been working in the school library; she was a cousin of Walter Ashburner, an old friend of Ashby's who had links with the British Institute at Florence. They married on 20 July 1921; there were no children.<br>
<br>Ashby feared that Eug&eacute;nie Strong would resent losing her role as hostess at the school, and indeed relations between them became strained. In 1924 the school's executive committee decided to renew both appointments for just one more year (when Mrs Strong would be sixty-five, and could be retired). The news was met with shock: Rennell Rodd reported in late November 1924:<blockquote>almost everyone I meet deplores the decision &hellip; In spite of Ashby's eccentricities he had the regard of all the Italian archaeologists and they are all very much upset at his going. In his own particular line he is considered one of the greatest authorities and his collections and maps which have been at the disposal of students are almost unique in their way. (Hodges, 79)</blockquote>In 1925 Ashby, who settled in Rome, set himself to complete three standard works: a valuable revision of the second part of W. J. Anderson and R. P. Spiers, <span class="italic">The architecture of Greece and Rome</span> (1927), first published in 1902; a thoroughly revised edition of Samuel B. Platner's <span class="italic">Topographical dictionary of ancient Rome</span> (1929); and Ashby's own <span class="italic">The aqueducts of ancient Rome</span>, a work of lasting value, published posthumously under the guidance of Ian Richmond in 1935. Ashby lectured in Australia (following up a first visit made in 1914), and in 1926 he embarked on a lecture tour of North America in conjunction with the Archaeological Institute of America. He also completed <span class="italic">Some Italian scenes and festivals</span> (1929), a work dedicated to his wife; it appeared in a revised edition as <span class="italic">Sagre e feste d'Abruzzo</span> (1995).<br>
<br>Ashby was a member of the German Archaeological Institute (1913), of the Pontificia Accademia Romana d'Archeologia (1914); a foreign member of the Reale Accademia dei Lincei (1918); an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1922); an honorary member of the Reale Accademia di San Luca (1925); and a fellow of the Reale Societ&agrave; Romana di Storia Patria (1923), and of the British Academy (1927). His figure was stocky, his head tall and forceful, with a neat beard first red and later white. He spoke equally brusque English and Italian; John Ward-Perkins recalled a &#145;flow of impeccably idiomatic Italian spoken in an accent which to his dying day remained obstinately British&#146;  (Hodges, 6). He was shy with strangers, blunt with acquaintances, and devoted to his friends.<br>
<br>Ashby's health seems to have been in decline&#151;one symptom was a deterioration in his eyesight. In 1930 he was elected to a senior research studentship at Christ Church, Oxford. He returned to England to fulfil the residence requirements and on his way to Oxford, on the morning of 15 May 1931, he fell from the Southampton to Waterloo train between New Malden and Raynes Park, Surrey. The post-mortem revealed that he had an enlarged brain tumour, and although there was a suspicion of suicide an open verdict was recorded. He was cremated and the ashes were interred at St Margaret's Bay in Kent, a place of which R. R. Campbell recalled that Ashby &#145;was almost as fond as of his own beloved Rome&#146;  (Smith, 521).<br>
