<span class="headword">Pryse <span class="st"> [Price]</span>, Sir  Carbery</span>, fourth baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1694), <span class="occ">mine owner and landowner</span>, was the son of Carbery Pryse (Price), landowner, and his wife, Hester, daughter of Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke. His family owned Gogerddan, one of the major estates in north Cardiganshire, close to the county town of Aberystwyth, and had jealously guarded their mineral rights throughout the seventeenth century. Pryse succeeded to the estate and baronetcy in 1682, following the death, without issue, of his two uncles, Richard and Thomas. He was elected as knight of the shire for Cardiganshire in March 1690 (and held the seat until 1694), but the controversy over his election did not endear him to many members of parliament and may help to account for the lengthy proceedings against him during his battle to secure his mineral rights.<br>
<br>Although British landowners had previously enjoyed the right to minerals on their estates, the crown in the sixteenth century sought to encourage mining in Britain by bringing over various German mining experts and granting chartered status in 1568 to two monopoly companies, the Company of Mines Royal and the Society of Mineral and Battery Works. The former was granted the right to minerals containing gold and silver, but since these metals were frequently found mixed with other metals, landowners found their mining rights severely compromised. This was especially true in Cardiganshire, where the lead which was mined all over the county was often very rich in silver. Lessees of the mines royal challenged various landowners over their mines, particularly after one of the lessees, Thomas Bushell, gained the establishment of a mint in Aberystwyth in 1638.<br>
<br>In the late 1680s a shepherd discovered a rich vein of lead ore at Bwlch-yr-esgair-hir on the eastern boundary of the Gogerddan estate. Pryse decided to work the vein himself, and on 1 January 1690 established a company, dividing the capital required into twenty-four shares. Of these, he kept twelve himself and sold the other twelve to shareholders who included the earl of Danby. He was then challenged by Anthony Shepherd, lessee of the mines royal in Cardiganshire, who claimed that the lead ore at Esgair Hir was argentiferous and therefore came within the mines royal monopoly. Pryse refused to surrender his mines, and eventually the case was tried before the House of Lords. Samples of the ore were assayed, and whereas that brought by Shepherd was rich in silver, the specimen submitted by Pryse himself was not. Moses Stringer, a noted mineralogist, believed that the sample came from Derbyshire and was provided by William Waller, Pryse's notorious mine manager, in a deliberate attempt to mislead the court. However, many members of parliament, as landowners themselves, were sympathetic to Pryse's case and the verdict was finally delivered in his favour. The outcome was an <span class="roman">Act to Prevent Disputes and Controversies concerning the Royal Mines</span>, which received royal assent in February 1693  (Shiers, 3), and thereafter landowners could work their own mines, even if they contained gold or silver, so long as the crown could purchase the ore from the mine owner&#151;a right that was rarely exercised. A contemporary report noted that &#145;upon the passing of this Bill, Sir Carbery Pryse, anxious to communicate the glad intelligence to his mining friends, rode from London to Esgair Hir in forty eight hours&#146;  (Hunt, 646).<br>
<br>Sir Carbery did not live long to enjoy his victory. The cost of draining the mines proved beyond the slender resources of the company he had set up, and in 1693 the capital was redivided into 4008 shares, Pryse retaining half and the remainder divided among the original members of the company. He had already engaged William Waller, a mine agent from the north of England, to run the company, though he remained chairman. To promote investment at Esgair Hir, Waller drew up an encouraging estimate of the profit of the mines at &pound;70,500 and later likened the mines to the rich silver mine of Potosi in Bolivia&#151;hence its name of Welsh Potosi. Pryse had intended to be an active chairman, but after his death in 1694 his heir, Edward Pryse, did not pursue the same policy and the company suffered from weak management. Waller eventually persuaded Sir Humphrey Mackworth, an industrialist from south Wales, to take over the company, and it was eventually worked by the Company of Mines Adventurers, founded in 1698.<br>
<br>Pryse, like his immediate predecessors, died unmarried, and the baronetcy, which had been created in 1641, expired with him. His vigour in pursuing his right to work his mines at Esgair Hir had, however, guaranteed the freedom of the British landowner to exploit the mineral resources on his estates, which was an important factor in Britain's early lead in industrialization.<br>
