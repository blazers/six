<span class="headword">Carlyle, Sir  Robert Warrand</span>  (1859&#150;1934), <span class="occ">administrator in India and writer on medieval subjects</span>, was born at Brechin on 11 July 1859, the elder son of James Edward Carlyle (1821&#150;1893), minister of the Free church at Brechin, and his wife, Jessie Margaret, daughter of James Milne, of Huntly, Aberdeenshire. His father was subsequently Free Church of Scotland chaplain in Bombay, Berlin, and Pietermaritzburg. The original spelling of the family name, Carlile, had been altered by Robert's grandfather, a kinsman of Thomas Carlyle.<br>
<br>Robert was educated privately and at Glasgow University. In 1878 he passed the open competition for the Indian Civil Service, and in December 1880, having spent his two years' probation at Balliol College, Oxford, was posted to Midnapore, Bengal, as assistant magistrate. His early career included several stints as an under-secretary to the governments of both Bengal and India. Appointed magistrate of Tippera in August 1894, in March 1896 he was transferred to Darbhanga, Bihar, just as the famine of 1896&#150;7 was beginning to bite. The commissioner of Patna, J. A. Bourdillon, praised without reservation his &#145;heart and soul&#146; relief effort, and in 1898 he was created CIE for his famine work.<br>
<br>In 1902 Carlyle was appointed inspector-general of the Bengal police. In the following year, on 29 September, he married Isabel Jane, daughter of James Barton, of Farndreg, Dundalk, co. Louth. In 1904 he became chief secretary to the government of Bengal. In 1907 he was further promoted to revenue and agriculture secretary to the government of India and in 1910 became head of that department on appointment to the executive council. An advocate of lighter revenue demands, he presided over increased investment in agriculture and an expansion of the fledgeling co-operative rural credit movement. As his council portfolio also included public works, from 1911 he bore responsibility for the planning and initial construction of the new imperial capital at Delhi. He was renowned in the government for his downright, uncompromising expression of opinion, but secretariat work was not particularly congenial to him, nor did he have much liking for the debates in the legislative council. He was appointed CSI in 1910 and KCSI in 1911.<br>
<br>In 1915 Carlyle retired to Essex and thereafter collaborated with his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32291/', "Alexander James Carlyle")</script> on volumes 3, 4, and 5 of <span class="italic">A History of Mediaeval Political Theory in the West</span> (6 vols., 1903&#150;36). An earlier publication, &#145;The political theories of St. Thomas Aquinas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Review</span>, January 1896), had been erroneously attributed to Alexander.<br>
<br>From 1916 to 1918 Carlyle served on the central tribune which determined adjustments between war service and industrial activities, and in 1919 he became a trustee of the king's fund. In 1916 Lady Carlyle was awarded the kaisar-i-Hind gold medal for her work in organizing comfort packages for the troops in Mesopotamia. In retirement both took a great interest in the work of Carlyle's cousin Prebendary Wilson Carlile, founder of the Church Army.<br>
<br>Carlyle died at via Alfieri 10, Florence, on 23 May 1934. He was survived by his wife. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
