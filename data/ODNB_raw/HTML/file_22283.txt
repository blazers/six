<span class="headword">Pillement,  Jean Baptiste</span>  (1728&#150;1808), <span class="occ">painter and designer</span>, was born in Lyon, France, on 24 May 1728. He came from a long line of painters, and after early training in his native Lyon he worked briefly at the Gobelins factory in Paris, before going to Madrid in 1745. In a three-year stay in the Iberian peninsula, the young painter established an enduring reputation. His rococo singerie and chinoiserie designs for the home of the Dutch consul at Seteais, near Sintra in Portugal, are the best-known achievement of this period. He was then offered the appointment of painter to the king of Portugal but, typically, he avoided such a commitment and travelled to London.<br>
<br>In the absence of modern scholarship, knowledge of Pillement's long, ten-year stay in England is incomplete, although he stayed longer in England than in any other country. However, there is no doubt of the success and the ongoing influence of his London period, and subsequent contacts with England. Through a link-up with English and French engravers and print dealers in London and Paris, his gifts for draughtsmanship and inventive design became widely known and, as intended, his prints were used as pattern books for fabrics, wallpaper, ceramics, and a variety of decorative schemes. Nothing is more indicative of the charm and originality of his invention than his book of engraved floral designs entitled <span class="italic">Fleurs de fantaisie</span>. He readily understood the English penchant for landscape and developed his original interpretation of the genre, derived from Nicolaes Berchem, Claude-Joseph Vernet, Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher, and a merging of observed nature and rococo fantasy.<br>
<br>Once the success of this formula had been established, Pillement maintained the same style, unaffected by changes in taste. Thus, among his exhibits at the Society of Artists (1760, 1761, 1762) and the Free Society of Artists (1763, 1773, 1779), landscapes with cattle, travellers, and coast scenes predominated. The same applies to the hundreds of works dispersed through auction in March 1761 from the collection of the French print dealer and publisher Charles Leviez, before Pillement left London. Among a number of English patrons, the actor David Garrick was the most notable. In 1772 the artist painted eleven pictures for Garrick's villa near Hampton Court, and their surviving correspondence reflects the excellent relations that Pillement enjoyed with his English patrons. By chance the best-known works by Pillement in England were acquired, after the artist's death, by the duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War in 1814 and remain at the family seat, Stratfield Saye, in Hampshire.<br>
<br>After London, Pillement made a brief visit to Italy before working in Vienna at the Hofburg in 1763&#150;4, and for the prince of Liechtenstein; he then moved on to further decorative interiors for the king of Poland (1766) at the royal castle in Warsaw, and at the Ujazdow Palace. He was invited to work at St Petersburg but went with his family to Avignon (1768). His unconventional career denied him recognition in his native country, but he exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1776, and executed a suite of three paintings for Marie-Antoinette at the Petit Trianon, Versailles. By 1780 he was again in Portugal where he decorated a celebrated small dining-room, again near Sintra, later recorded by the enchanted William Beckford. His five large canvases of elegant company in the gardens at Benfica, Lisbon (Mus&eacute;e des Arts Decoratifs, Paris), are unique achievements, and further emphasize the versatility of the artist. During a stay in Porto, he established a teaching studio and taught a number of Portuguese painters, among whom Joaquim Marqu&eacute;s (1755&#150;1822) is the most notable. The tradition of Portuguese interest in Pillement has continued in modern times with a recent loan exhibition of his work from Portuguese collections, with a substantial catalogue with French and English editions published in 1996. From his Portuguese experience come his views of shipping and fishermen in the Tagus estuary, often including a &#145;free&#146; impression of the Bel&eacute;m tower, which are, today, among his most admired works. His marine views included shipwrecks and salvaging scenes, experienced at first hand by the artist on one occasion. The influence of Vernet is, of course, apparent in both categories. Pillement died in Lyon on 26 April 1808. His son, Victor Pillement, was an able draughtsman and engraver.<br>
<br>Pillement was a prolific and versatile artist who worked throughout Europe in a long career of ceaseless activity and travel. He worked in most media with a huge and variable output and it is important to distinguish between his two roles: that of designer and decorator, filling pages with, for example, chinoiserie scenes, imaginary flowers, and occupations for the four seasons; and his status as an important French rococo landscape painter, and arguably the finest exponent of the medium of pastel in eighteenth-century landscape and marine painting.<br>
