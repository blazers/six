<span class="headword">Stevenson,  John  Hall-</span>  (1718&#150;1785), <span class="occ">poet and satirist</span>, probably born at Skelton Castle, Yorkshire, the eldest of three surviving sons and one daughter born to Joseph Hall (<i>bap</i>. 1693, <i>d</i>. 1731), a Durham lawyer, and his wife, Catherine Trotter (1694?&#150;1740), sister of Lawson Trotter of Skelton Castle. On 16 June 1735 he enrolled as a fellow-commoner of Jesus College, Cambridge (where he met Laurence Sterne), and on 21 November was admitted to the Inner Temple. Originating in shared literary enthusiasms, notably for Rabelais, his friendship with Sterne, for which he is principally known, lasted until the latter's death. About 1738 Hall left university without taking a degree and made the grand tour. On 7 February 1740 he married an heiress, &#145;Miss Stevenson, a young Lady of 25,000 l. fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">York Courant</span>, 12 February 1740); &#145;The Ceremony was perform'd by the Rev. Mr. Sterne of Sutton-Forest&#146;  (Cash, <span class="italic">Early and Middle Years</span>, 79). Anne Stevenson (buried at Skelton, 1 August 1790) was the daughter of Ambrose Stevenson, of Manor House, Lanchester, near Durham, and his wife, Ann Wharton, daughter of Anthony Wharton of Gillingwood, near Richmond, Yorkshire; her father later lost the fortune for which Hall had married. <br>
<br>Joseph Hall bought Skelton Castle from Lawson Trotter, and his son, who assumed his wife's surname in addition to his own, devoted the partly ruined castle in the north-east corner of Yorkshire's North Riding to baronial hospitality and fashionably Gothic defiance of propriety. An engraving of Crazy Castle, as Hall-Stevenson called it, forms the frontispiece to his <span class="italic">Works</span> (1795); to the indignation of a local clergyman who drew and described the old castle  (Ord, 253), Hall-Stevenson's grandson, who took the surname Wharton, built the existing neo-Gothic building. During the 1745 Jacobite rising Hall-Stevenson and other local hunters formed the royal hunters, a volunteer troop who successfully engaged the Jacobites, earning thanks from the duke of Cumberland. Hall-Stevenson served on the grand jury for the Lent assizes of 1746 but otherwise took little part in public affairs. He collected an extensive library in which Sterne read freely. Contemporaries praised his good breeding and conversation, but he was also a hypochondriac who apparently once took to his bed during an east wind, rising only after Sterne paid a boy to tie the weathercock in a more favourable position. Freethinking and anti-clerical, he supported Sterne in his last days but avoided his funeral. <br>
<br>A lurid reputation for licentiousness and blasphemy attends both Hall-Stevenson's verse and the loosely structured club of &#145;demoniacs&#146; he modelled on Francis Dashwood's <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71306', "Franciscans")</script>. This circle of avid hunters and shooters delighted in bawdy wit. Yet it included some remarkably capable eccentrics, and as A. H. Cash shrewdly observes, &#145;The most rakish of them, Zachary Moore, founded a Sunday school at Loftus&#146;  (Cash, <span class="italic">Early and Middle Years</span>, 193). Nicknamed Panty, after Rabelais's Pantagruel, the unconventional clergyman Robert Lascelles was a fellow soldier who became Hall-Stevenson's gamekeeper in 1755 and accepted the living of Gilling West from him in 1777, writing a book, published posthumously, on angling, shooting, and coursing. Skelton Castle attracted Sterne, another unconventional clergyman, and Andrew Irvine, schoolmaster of Kirkleatham School. Hall-Stevenson celebrated William Chambers, not yet famous, as &#145;Don Pringello&#146;, the architect so impressed by Crazy Castle that he added only a few ornaments  (Hartley, &#145;Don Pringello&#146;). Tobias Smollett praised William Hewett as an original in <span class="italic">Humphry Clinker</span>. Active soldiers included Colonel John Hale, Hall-Stevenson's brothers Thomas and George Lawson Hall (<span class="italic">Letters of Laurence Sterne</span>, 141, n. 6; Cash, <span class="italic">Early and Middle Years</span>, 190, n. 1), and perhaps Charles &#145;Savage&#146; Lee, later George Washington's second in command. <br>
<br>Hall-Stevenson adopted fashionable verse forms as early as <span class="italic">Hymn to Miss Lawrence in the Pump-Room at Bath</span> (1755) but caught the public eye by exploiting the notoriety of Sterne, John Wilkes (with whom he was also acquainted), and Charles Churchill. Typically grouping fables or tales in a loose frame, he imitated not only La Fontaine, whose example justified his irregular verse, but also Rabelais, Boccaccio, and Chaucer. Following <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>'s immediate success, &#145;Antony Shandy&#146; welcomed Cousin Tristram (Sterne) to London in <span class="italic">Two lyric epistles: one to my cousin Shandy on his coming to town; and the other to the grown gentlewomen, the misses of ****</span> (1760). (Hereafter, Sterne frequently addressed his &#145;cousin&#146; Antony, and Hall-Stevenson wrote <span class="italic">Crazy Tales</span> as &#145;A. S.&#146;.) More carnal than sentimental, <span class="italic">A sentimental dialogue between two souls in the palpable bodies of an English lady of quality and an Irish gentleman</span> (1768) followed Sterne's <span class="italic">Sentimental Journey</span>, but Hall-Stevenson did not write the 1769 sequel sometimes attributed to him  (see Hartley, &#145;Yorick's sentimental journey&#146;). <span class="italic">Crazy Tales</span> (1762) assigns Chaucerian tales to fictionalized members of Hall-Stevenson's circle, although many of them cannot be attributed accurately; editions appeared in 1764, 1769, 1825 (attributed to &#145;the late Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#146;), and 1894 (for private subscribers). The prologue evokes Crazy Castle itself, while the opening of &#145;My cousin's tale of a cock and a bull&#146; commemorates Sterne and Hall-Stevenson's days learning to &#145;wrangle&#146; beneath the ancient walnut tree in the quadrangle of Jesus College. Hall-Stevenson compares the tree's windings with both a corkscrew and <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>'s narrative obliquity, characteristically blending conviviality with wit. Even in a satiric collection, <span class="italic">Makarony Fables: with the New Fable of the Bees: in Two Cantos</span>, Hall-Stevenson includes &#145;The Black-Bird&#146;, a poem appropriating Sterne for his own anti-clerical position. <br>
<br>Although some reviewers found them obscure, Hall-Stevenson's eight verse tales in <span class="italic">Fables for Grown Gentlemen, or, A Fable for Every Day in the Week</span> (1761; 2nd edn, 1762; part 2, 1770) were well received. &#145;The River with a Petition&#146; expresses the virulent anti-Scottish feeling that Lord Bute's ministry provoked in England. Having defended himself in <span class="italic">A Nosegay and a Simile for the Reviewers, a Lyric Epistle</span> (1760), Hall-Stevenson defied offended reviewers of <span class="italic">Fables</span> in <span class="italic">Two Lyric Epistles, or, Margery the Cook-Maid to the Critical Reviewers</span> (1762). In an appendix to <span class="italic">A pastoral cordial, or, An anodyne sermon, preached before their graces N[ewcastle] and D[evonshire] by an independent teacher of truth</span> (1763), he attacked &#145;judging Caledonian Pedlars&#146; generally and Smollett particularly  (Hall-Stevenson, 1.134&#150;7). This overt political satire was followed by <span class="italic">A Pastoral Puke: a Second Sermon Preached Before the People Called Whigs</span> (1764). <span class="italic">Lyric consolations, with the speech of Alderman W[ilkes] and delivered in a dream at king's bench prison the evening of his inauguration</span> (1769) imitated Horace's odes to satirize contemporary politics. A prose work, <span class="italic">An essay upon the king's friends, with an account of some discoveries made in Italy &hellip; to Dr. S[amuel] J[ohnson]</span> (1776), comments on fictitious Virgilian variants to satirize Johnson's <span class="italic">Taxation No Tyranny</span>. <span class="italic">Fables for Grown Gentlemen</span>, the most popular of this group, was reprinted with <span class="italic">Makarony Fables</span> and other works (1772), with <span class="italic">Crazy Tales</span> (1780), and in two miscellanies, <span class="italic">The Poetical Calendar</span> (12 vols., 1763) and <span class="italic">The New Foundling Hospital for Wit</span> (4 vols., 1786). <br>
<br>Hall-Stevenson died on 25 March 1785 and was buried at Skelton. More sophomoric than salacious, his irreverent and often sexual verse sometimes captures the ribald masculine wit of Crazy Castle, intermittently suggesting the marital unhappiness he and Sterne had in common. Despite a carefully prepared posthumous collection of his works (3 vols., 1795), he is best remembered as the hospitable friend on whom Sterne modelled his Eugenius.<br>
