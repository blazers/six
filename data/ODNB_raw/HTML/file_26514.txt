<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  William, of Jedworth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1402), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, is often thought to have been a younger son of Sir Alexander Stewart of Darnley, but the evidence to this effect is inconclusive and he may instead have come from a branch of the Stewarts in Teviotdale, Roxburghshire. He was possibly a son of Sir John Stewart of Jedworth, who was active in the English allegiance in the 1350s and 1360s, and his wife, a sister of Sir John Turnbull of Minto.<br>
<br>It is thought that Stewart, himself a Teviotdale landholder, was an ally of the English until 1384, when a major Scottish offensive recaptured the area. Like many around him, he appears to have participated enthusiastically in the process of reconquest, and on 2 July 1384 he was rewarded by Robert II with a grant of Roxburghshire lands. That Stewart was active in further Scottish attacks on England during the 1380s is indicated by his receipt of 100 livres tournois from the French expeditionary force to Scotland of 1385 and by his presence in 1388 in the Scottish host at the battle of Otterburn. Quick assimilation into Scottish aristocratic society is the striking feature of Stewart's career after his change of allegiance. He was knighted between 1385 and December 1390, and throughout the next decade served in official positions in the Scottish government. He frequently acted as an auditor of the exchequer and in the late 1390s took part in diplomatic missions to England, was a commissioner at march days, and was one of those in charge of enforcing border law on the Scottish middle march. He also became sheriff of Roxburghshire.<br>
<br>Stewart received regular pensions and annuities from the royal exchequer in the 1390s, including a retaining fee from 1392 for his services to Robert III's eldest son, David, future duke of Rothesay. A regular witness of royal charters at this time, Stewart seems to have emerged as a prominent figure in national politics; he served on parliamentary commissions, most notably the council of 1399 which was designed to oversee the lieutenancy of the duke of Rothesay. This suggests strong links with the royal household, but Stewart survived the political eclipse of Rothesay in 1401, and apparently retained close ties to the Douglas affinity. He had been involved in attacking Roxburgh some time in the 1390s in the company of Archibald Douglas, later fourth earl of Douglas. The Roxburgh attack, in breach of the Anglo-Scottish truce, and despite the border offices held by Stewart, is an indication of his personal bellicosity towards England, a tendency shared at the time by much of the Scottish nobility. This predilection was given free rein in the climate of severely worsened relations between the two after the deposition of Richard II in 1399.<br>
<br>In 1400 Stewart appears to have made an unsuccessful raid on Northumberland, and he was in the Scottish host which was heavily defeated at Hamildon Hill on 14 September 1402. Stewart's death must have occurred shortly afterwards, as he was captured in the battle, tried, and executed for treason at the instigation of Sir Henry Percy (<i>d</i>. 1403). Stewart had previously been in the allegiance of the English king, which gave a legal justification for his treatment, and there was a precedent in Edward III's execution of the earl of Menteith after his capture in 1346 at the battle of Nevilles Cross. It is hard, though, not to perceive a personal element in Percy's reaction to Stewart's capture. Within the context of Anglo-Scottish warfare in the late fourteenth century there may well have developed a highly charged animosity between Stewart and Percy, which found its expression in 1402. Only the first name is known of Stewart's wife, Isabel, and she was probably still alive in 1420. They had at least two sons, of whom John succeeded.<br>
