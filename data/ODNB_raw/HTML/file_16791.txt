<span class="headword">Ligulf</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1080), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was an Anglo-Danish landowner with substantial hereditary landholdings in Yorkshire. It has been suggested that he may also be that Ligulf, lawman of York, who gave evidence on the archbishop's liberty in 1080. During the Norman occupation of the north of England he seems to have been displaced in the aftermath of the rebellion in Yorkshire against William I, <i>c</i>.1068&#150;1070. He made his way north with his family and his Yorkshire estates may have passed to Robert, count of Mortain. Ligulf is described as a devotee of St Cuthbert and John of Worcester's chronicle says that he would recount to Ealdred, archbishop of York, his visions of the saint; but his decision to settle in the area to the north of the Tees was probably more influenced by his marriage to Ealdgyth, the daughter of Ealdred, earl of Northumbria. With the death of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20929/', "Earl Osulf")</script>, the exile of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11110/', "Earl Gospatric")</script>, and the execution in 1076 of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28646/', "Earl Waltheof")</script>, Ligulf may have become the most senior representative of the comital house of Bamburgh, and therein lies his importance in northern English politics at this period. It was probably in this capacity that he became one of the closest advisers of Walcher, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1080), who had assumed the role of earl of Northumbria after Waltheof's execution. Ligulf is described as a &#145;noble and good thegn&#146; by the author of the Durham compilation the <span class="italic">Historia regum Anglorum</span> and it is said that Bishop Walcher would not conduct any secular matters without his advice, indicating a close working relationship between the Norman-appointed bishop and the representative of the native aristocracy.<br>
<br>The administration was, however, undermined by the antagonism towards Ligulf of two members of Walcher's entourage, his chaplain Leobwin and the bishop's kinsman, Gilbert. Leobwin had been elevated to a high position within Walcher's <i>familia</i> with general oversight of the administration of the bishopric and county of Durham, possibly indicative of archidiaconal status. Leobwin opposed Ligulf's counsel and quarrelled with him often in the bishop's presence. In one meeting of the episcopal council Ligulf seems to have won the day, prompting Leobwin to plot Ligulf's death with Gilbert, who had been appointed governor of the earldom under the bishop. One night in April or May 1080, Gilbert and Leobwin, together with their own men and soldiers of the bishop, marched to Ligulf's residence and slew him and almost all of his family. Learning of Ligulf's murder, Bishop Walcher retired to Durham Castle and sent out messengers dissociating himself from the act, offering to banish Gilbert from the bishopric and submit himself to the judgment of the pope. At this point Walcher may have also tried to conciliate Ligulf's wife with a gift of land. A meeting was arranged between the two sides at Gateshead on 14 May 1080 where, despite Walcher's protestation of innocence, the Northumbrians slaughtered the bishop and his men.<br>
<br>Ligulf had two recorded sons with Ealdgyth, Morcar and Uhtred. By 1074&#150;5 Morcar had been given as a boy to the monastery at Jarrow through the intervention of his uncle Earl Waltheof. He may also be the Morcar, son of Ligulf, who appears as a lawman of York in the early twelfth century. Uhtred may have succeeded his father in some of his Yorkshire lands as <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> records an Uhtred as tenant of the king in the manor of Rudston in Yorkshire in 1086. It is just possible that Ligulf had a daughter, since a Ragnald, daughter of Ligulf and wife of Robert de Sarz, appears making a series of grants to Fountains Abbey, probably in the 1130s.<br>
