</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beaw,  William</span>  (1616&#150;1706), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff</span>, was born in December 1616 in Hagbourne, Berkshire, the son of William Beaw, a beneficed clergyman, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Twisse, who was of German descent and the daughter of William Twisse, clothier. Raised under the influence of his uncle, the puritan theologian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27921/', "William Twisse")</script>, who was later to be prolocutor of the Westminster assembly, William was educated, from 1629, at Winchester College, and at New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 6 November 1635. He graduated BA on 13 June 1637 and was elected to the fellowship on 19 September 1638; he proceeded MA in 1643. Oxford had by now become the king's headquarters in the armed struggle against parliament and Beaw, like some other scholars, joined royalist forces.<br>
<br>However, unlike other future leaders of the Church of England&#151;and after being ejected from his position as proctor in the university by the parliamentary visitors in 1647&#151;Beaw became a mercenary overseas. A portrait of Beaw dating to the late 1690s, and now in the possession of the National Trust at Croft Castle, Herefordshire, reveals a missing right index finger and facial scar, both sustained in his years in the military. Much of what is known of Beaw derives from two autobiographical works written in old age: the first is an often outspoken letter, written to Archbishop Thomas Tenison and dated 21 August 1699, which charts his life since university and the many slights he had received  (LPL, MS 930, fol. 49); the second takes the form of two manuscript statements, written in 1702 in the third person and identified by Sweet-Escott as &#145;almost certainly composed by Beaw himself&#146; (Willis MSS 2 and 3, cited in Sweet-Escott, 397). During the 1650s he served as a secret agent for Charles II in Copenhagen, where he served Edward Hyde, the future earl of Clarendon, who was the chief secretary of state to the king in exile.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Beaw resumed his fellowship at New College, Oxford, and entered holy orders in August 1660 on the advice of Clarendon's kinsman Alexander Hyde, the future bishop of Salisbury. He was instituted into the Oxfordshire vicarage of Adderbury in February of the following year and retained the living until his death in 1706. He proceeded BD on 6 July 1666. Beaw regarded his ambitions as unfulfilled, being convinced that he deserved better reward for his political loyalty to the crown during the civil wars, but he does appear to have received some patronage from Clarendon's son Laurence Hyde, created earl of Rochester in 1682 and brother-in-law of James, duke of York. In the mid-1660s he married Frances Bourchier (<i>d</i>. in or after 1706), daughter of Alexander Bourchier, of Southampton; the couple had eight children of whom the eldest, William, was born in 1666.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1679 a royal directive was issued for Beaw's election to Llandaff, a poor and isolated Welsh bishopric. His consecration in Lambeth Palace chapel on 22 June at the height of the Popish Plot&#151;a period of acute political discord surrounding the eventual succession to the throne of the Roman Catholic duke of York&#151;heralded the start of a vexing career in the episcopate. Beaw fully expected imminent translation to a more prosperous bishopric, claiming in old age earlier assurances that accepting Llandaff would place him &#145;in order to a better&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4292, fols. 65&#150;6). In November 1680 Beaw took his seat in the House of Lords in the second Exclusion Parliament, so called because the attempt by whigs to secure the exclusion of the duke of York from succession to the crown dominated business. He attended that parliament regularly, his voting behaviour consistent with his support for the king and his fellow bishops: in November 1680 he voted against the exclusion of the future James II. In 1683 Beaw suffered a broken ankle which rendered him permanently disabled and added to the problems of travel throughout his diocese and to Westminster.<br>
<br>Beaw was also keen to promote members of his family and was known to be litigious, almost certainly encouraged by his son William, a future MP and diocesan chancellor. His controversial appointment of his son to office resulted in a lengthy chancery case which, by 1692, went to appeal in the House of Lords. The house upheld the chancery decree against the younger William, but the Beaws contested the ruling and lodged an appeal against costs, only for the Lords to dismiss Beaw's appeal as &#145;frivolous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fourteenth Report</span>, HMC, pt 6, 16). Beaw's nepotism did not help his wayward son whose unremarkable career as an MP was marked by debt and eventual death in the Fleet in January 1738. With a large family to maintain, Beaw was also active in chasing additional income. The crown had allowed him to retain <i>in commendam</i> his living at Adderbury together with the Welsh rectories of Bedwas in Monmouthshire and St Andrew's in Glamorgan. The income from Adderbury was &pound;330 per annum, &pound;100 more than his diocesan revenue, but even so Beaw was in permanent straits, admitting that he had lived beyond his means as &#145;answerable to my dignity&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner, 146, fol. 161). He refused to attend the coronation of James II in April 1685 but did continue to attend the House of Lords during every session between 1680 and 1691. During James's reign he opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> and supported the actions of the seven bishops who had been imprisoned, and in June 1688 acquitted, for refusing to obey the king's demand that his declaration of indulgence, granting religious toleration, be read from Anglican pulpits. Beaw did not join the non-jurors after the accession of William and Mary, but in the first session of the Convention Parliament he supported a regency and voted against the motion that James II had abdicated. He made his political feelings clear by failing to attend the Lords for seven sessions during the reign of William III. Less than two months after the death of the king in March 1702, Beaw resumed his seat in the Lords. He attended the house twice in December 1702, but did not reappear until a final visit on 12 November 1705. After prayers that day he took the oath to abjure James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite claimant to the throne.<br>
<br>Beaw's career was characterized by his fruitless pursuit of preferment; his failed bid to transfer to the long vacant see of Hereford was followed by successful attempts for Lichfield and St Asaph in 1692. In 1697 he moved permanently to his vicarage at Adderbury, the upkeep of the medieval bishops' residence at Mathern having been the final straw for Beaw's finances. Overseeing his bishopric from a distance, diocesan oversight suffered severe neglect. In old age he complained bitterly that his meagre episcopal income left him seeking charity  (BL, Add. MS 4292, fols. 64&#150;5). Hoping that the accession of Anne in 1702 would finally reverse his fortunes, he attended her coronation and delivered a lengthy memorandum, dated 23 April 1702, detailing his plight (Willis MSS 2 and 3, cited in Sweet-Escott, 409). The queen referred his request for a grant of tenths from his diocese to the attorney-general. William Beaw died on 10 February 1706 at Adderbury, where he was buried in the chancel of St Mary's Church. He was survived by his wife to whom was granted an annual pension of &pound;40 in acknowledgment of her husband's services.<br>
