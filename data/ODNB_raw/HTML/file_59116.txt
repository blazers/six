<span class="headword">Mingana,  Alphonse</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Hurmiz Mingana]</span>  (1878?&#150;1937), <span class="occ">Syriac and Christian Arabic scholar</span>, was born on 23 December probably in 1878 (not 1881 as usually stated) in Sharansh al-&#145;Ulya in the district of Zakho, vilayet of Mosul (now northern Iraq), the eldest of the eight children of Pa&ocirc;l&ocirc;s Mingana, Chaldean Catholic priest, and his wife, Maryam N&acirc;n&ocirc;, both of Burjan. He had an extraordinary facility with languages. Brought up speaking neo-Aramaic, he was sent in 1891 to the Syro-Chaldean Seminary of St Jean in Mosul where, in addition to the usual theological education, he studied Arabic and Syriac&#151;taught by the great Ya&#145;qub Awgin Manna (1867&#150;1928)&#151;Turkish, Persian, Kurdish, biblical Hebrew, Latin, and French.<br>
<br>After being ordained priest in 1902, when he assumed the religious name Alphonse, Mingana taught Syriac in the seminary. From 1903 to 1910 he was also corrector of Syriac and Arabic books for the Dominican Press in Mosul. This period is remarkable, however, for two publications which established Mingana's controversial reputation. In 1905 he published an edition of the works of Narsai, an important fifth-century theologian, which included in its introduction a passage without any textual basis, despite Mingana's claims. In 1907 he published the Syriac chronicle of Mshiha-Zkha from a manuscript said to be of the tenth century but subsequently revealed to be an early twentieth-century work whose scribe admitted having &#145;aged&#146; it on Mingana's instructions. Most scholars decided that Mingana had composed the chronicle himself, and repeated charges of forgery, though never substantiated, were to dog his career. Ironically one of his footnotes to the chronicle, in which he questioned the historicity of Mar Mari, one of the apostles credited with founding the Syrian churches, angered the Chaldean patriarch who in 1910 removed Mingana from his seminary position.<br>
<br>In March 1913, having severed his connections with the Chaldean church, Mingana left for England where he was welcomed and employed as a teacher of Arabic and Hebrew by J. Rendel Harris, the director of studies at Woodbrooke, a Quaker college in Selly Oak, Warwickshire. Mingana, who from 1914 assumed the title Doctor, collaborated with Harris to produce the celebrated edition of the <span class="italic">Odes and Psalms of Solomon</span> (1916; 1920). While at Woodbrooke, Mingana met Emma Sophie Floor (<i>d</i>. 1974), a Norwegian Lutheran from Stavanger, the daughter of a bookseller. They were married on 14 July 1915 at a Quaker meeting-house in King's Norton, and had two children: John, born in 1916, and Marie, born in 1918.<br>
<br>From 1915 until 1932 Mingana was employed by the John Rylands Library, Manchester, to produce a catalogue of its Arabic manuscripts (published in 1934). For a few years (1916&#150;23) he was a special lecturer in Arabic at the University of Manchester, although he never enjoyed public speaking. During the First World War, Mingana produced vocabularies for the use of the British armed forces in the Middle East and in 1920 he was naturalized as a British citizen.<br>
<br>The remainder of Mingana's life was to be dominated by his passion for manuscripts. Largely at the expense of Dr Edward Cadbury, Mingana travelled in 1924 and 1925 to Syria and Iraq and in 1929 to the Sinai and Upper Egypt where he acquired more than 2000 Syriac and Arabic manuscripts. The majority of these, constituting one of the largest such collections in the world, went to the college in Selly Oak where he himself catalogued them (1933&#150;9). From 1932 he lived not far away, at 168 Middleton Hall Road, King's Norton, in a house named Manuscripta. Some Syriac manuscripts went to the John Rylands Library, although Mingana replaced ten of the most important of these with inferior texts from Selly Oak. He published many Syriac and Arabic texts in the series <span class="roman">Woodbrooke Studies</span> (1927&#150;34), followed in 1935 by Job of Edessa's <span class="italic">Book of Treasures</span>. He died at his home on 5 December 1937.<br>
