<span class="headword">Torch,  Sidney</span>  (1908&#150;1990), <span class="occ">organist, conductor, and composer</span>, was born on 5 June 1908 at 27 Tottenham Court Road, London, the son of Morris Torchinsky and his wife, Annie Hoppen. His father, an orchestral trombonist, sent him to study piano at the Blackheath Conservatoire. Clearly Torch must have been a talented pianist because his first professional engagement was as accompanist to the celebrated violinist Albert Sandler. He then moved into several cinema orchestras playing for silent films, but the arrival of talking pictures towards the end of the 1920s meant that full orchestras were no longer needed, and even prestigious ensembles such as Emanuel Starkey's orchestra at the Regal, Marble Arch (in which Torch also played piano), were disbanded. At the Regal a Christie organ was built in 1928, and Torch was full-time organist there from 1932 to 1934.<br>
<br>Despite the popularity of his jazzy arrangements with cinema-goers who heard him in person, and the thousands of record buyers who purchased his 78s, the BBC did not invite Torch to broadcast regularly until late in 1934. Microphones of the period had great difficulty coping with the wide dynamics and timbral range of modern organs. In 1936 he joined Union Cinemas and recorded at their flagship theatre, the Regal in Kingston upon Thames. The following year he opened the magnificent Wurlitzer organ at the Gaumont State, Kilburn, then the largest cinema organ in England.<br>
<br>The Second World War affected, but did not curtail, Torch's promising career; in 1940 he joined the Royal Air Force, initially being stationed near Blackpool, Lancashire, where he continued to record at the opera house. After training as an air gunner he was commissioned and attained the rank of squadron leader. He became conductor of the RAF Concert Orchestra, thus allowing him to study more closely the intricacies of orchestral scoring. This proved invaluable when he resumed civilian life after the war. He turned to light orchestral composing, arranging, and conducting, in which he quickly established himself through his BBC radio broadcasts and commercial recordings for Parlophone and Columbia.<br>
<br>Torch's composing talents were ideally suited to the requirements of the production music (mood music) publishers, who were rapidly establishing libraries of recorded orchestral music in London. Chappells had already started recording light music on 78 r.p.m. discs for the use of radio, film, newsreel, and eventually television companies as early as 1942, and from 1946 onwards Torch contributed more than a hundred varied works to the Chappell catalogue, both under his own name and as Denis Rycoth (an anagram). He also conducted the Queen's Hall Light Orchestra on these special recordings, and was similarly engaged by rival publishers Francis, Day, and Hunter.<br>
<br>The climax of Torch's career came in 1953, when he helped the BBC devise <span class="italic">Friday Night is Music Night</span>. The BBC Concert Orchestra had been formed the previous year, and Torch conducted them for almost twenty years in this radio series on the Light Programme (and later Radio 2), until his retirement in 1972. His inventive arrangements continued to be heard long after his departure from the programme. During this period he became one of the most popular and respected conductors of light music in Britain. His countless broadcasts included many celebrity concerts, often at London's Royal Festival Hall as part of the BBC's regular light music festivals.<br>
<br>Torch had a reputation as something of a martinet, according to the musicians and singers who performed under his baton. One described the crackle that emanated from his starched shirt-cuffs on some of his rapier-like downbeats. Singers dreaded &#145;the glare of the Torch&#146; if they failed to please the maestro. Yet he was also remembered for various acts of kindness, seldom made public, but nevertheless appreciated by some of his musicians who needed temporary financial assistance. He demanded smartness in the dress sense from his musicians, and always had in reserve an extra pair of gloves or black socks in case of need. His music was also often entertaining to watch as well as to hear: his <span class="italic">London Transport Suite</span> and <span class="italic">Duel for Drummers</span> are ideal examples requiring athletic participation from the percussion section. Among his best-known compositions were <span class="italic">Shooting Star</span>, <span class="italic">Samba sud</span>, <span class="italic">Going for a Ride</span>, <span class="italic">On a Spring Note</span>, and <span class="italic">The Trapeze Waltz</span>. Torch was married to Eva Elizabeth Tyson (1915&#150;1990), a BBC producer.<br>
<br>Following his retirement Torch seemed to lose interest in his previous musical activities. He rarely wanted to talk about his pre-war stardom as a cinema organist, and similarly dismissed most attempts to get him to recall his great moments in light music. In a rare radio interview in 1983 he admitted that he had been cruel to most of his producers, although he felt that many of them probably benefited from the experience. He was appointed MBE in 1985. Torch died at his Sussex home, Flat 3, The Moorings, St Johns Road, Eastbourne, on 16 July 1990 at the age of eighty-two, having taken an overdose. His wife had died on 1 March 1990.<br>
