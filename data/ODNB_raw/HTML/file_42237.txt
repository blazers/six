<span class="headword">Janyns,  Henry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1453&#150;1483), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was probably the son of Robert Janyns senior, master mason of the tower of Merton College chapel, Oxford (begun 1448), and warden of the masons at Eton College from 1449. By 1453/4 John Clerk was the warden at Eton and Henry Janyns was his apprentice. Under Clerk's will of 1459 Henry was left his master's tools and designs, together with 26<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in cash. Apart from a possible reference to him in 1463/4 in connection with carvings for the gatehouse at Merton, he is next heard of in 1478, by which time he was master mason of Edward IV's new chapel of St George in Windsor Castle. Probably in charge since 1475, when work began, he is last mentioned in 1483. In 1481 a house of his at Burford was leased for use by the king's masons, who were no doubt occupied in the nearby Taynton quarries which supplied practically all the stone for the chapel.<br>
<br>St George's Chapel was the most ambitious new church begun in late fifteenth-century England. Of cathedral format but restricted scale, its main sources are the two outstanding church buildings of the preceding century, the choir of St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester (now the cathedral), and the nave of Canterbury Cathedral. The exceptionally consistent use of flattened four-centred arches imparts a distinctive rigour and elegance to the elevations, and the fan vaults in the aisles display complete mastery of the problems of designing a vault type which was much used in the Oxford region.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42238"></a><span class="headword">Robert Janyns junior</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1506), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, probably Henry's son, is first recorded in 1499 as master mason of the extension to the king's lodging in Windsor Castle known as Henry VII's Tower. Its outstanding feature is its multi-tier bay windows of complex form, some of which change plan at each level. Robert probably succeeded Henry Janyns as master mason of St George's Chapel, but there is unfortunately no documentary evidence for the identity of the holder of this post during his lifetime. He is also the master mason most likely to have designed Henry VII's most important architectural commission, the lady chapel built at Westminster Abbey from 1503. The main elevations and many other aspects of the design show a thorough understanding both of the originality of St George's and of its indebtedness to earlier designs. The attribution of the Westminster chapel to Robert Vertue, which has sometimes been advanced, founders on the dissimilarity of its vaults to those at Bath Abbey, which are Vertue's only documented and extant work. Robert Janyns's short and simple will, proved on 9 October 1506, shows that Burford was his home town.<br>
