<span class="headword">Finch,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1663, <em>d.</em> 1738), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and musician</span>, was baptized on 20 April 1663 at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, the fifth surviving son among the fourteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9433/', "Heneage Finch, first earl of Nottingham (1621&#150;1682)")</script>, lord chancellor, and his wife, Elizabeth Harvey (<i>d</i>. 1676), daughter of William Harvey. Edward was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 8 June 1677; he proceeded to the degree of MA in 1679, and from 1680 to 1684 was a fellow there. On 23 April 1683 he was admitted to the Inner Temple but he did not pursue a legal career. In 1689 he was appointed under-secretary of state to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9427/', "Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham")</script>, and in 1690 was elected member of parliament for Cambridge University. He supported the administration in the Commons but became disheartened by party rivalries and in 1693 resigned his under-secretaryship. He did not stand for election in 1695. At the age of thirty-two Edward took holy orders; he was ordained deacon at York on 8 September 1695 and priest a week later. His opportunities in the church were limited following his brother's fall from power and it was not until 1704 that he was preferred to the prebend of Wetwang in York Minster by Archbishop John Sharp. The next year he was appointed rector of Kirkby in Cleveland, a sinecure.<br>
<br>Between 1707 and 1713 Finch was rector of Wigan. There he became involved in a dispute with some of his parishioners concerning the positioning of an organ within the parish church. He also took a leading role in managing the tory interest in the borough. At some time before 1707 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1742), daughter of Nicholas Stanley, fellow of New College, Oxford; the marriage was childless. In 1710 he became a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral, in 1715 a chaplain to George I, and in 1718 rector of Eyam, Derbyshire. On leaving Wigan he probably took up permanent residence in York and from 1728 lived there in the north part of what is now known as the Treasurer's House. He was cited to the chapter of York Minster in 1730 for contempt after failing to give up the keys of the capitular chest. He died at York on 14 February 1738 and was buried three days later in the south aisle of York Minster.<br>
<br>Finch's posthumous reputation rests on his activities as an amateur musician. In the 1680s he composed a piece for violin (or flute) and continuo, &#145;The Cuckoo&#146;, which was published in 1693. Ten other unpublished sonatas for the same instruments are included in a Durham Cathedral Library manuscript. Given the six flutes that he owned at the time of his death and the several flute fingering charts in his music manuscripts, it seems probable that he was a flautist. He composed three pieces of sacred music: a <span class="roman">Te Deum in G minor</span> (1708); a short anthem, &#145;Grant we beseech thee, O merciful Lord&#146; (before 1715); and a <span class="roman">Jubilate in G minor</span> (1721). These works were copied into the York Minster choir books, and thus were probably performed there, but there is no evidence to suggest performance elsewhere. He also adapted two works by A. Steffani for use as anthems in York Minster. Finch's small musical output, in which lapses in technique sometimes reveal the amateur, is made up with a few catches and Anglican chants. After his death a part of his collection of music went to Thomas Sharp, then to the latter's son, Granville, and was finally dispersed by sale in 1814.<br>
