<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cusack,  Cyril James</span>  (1910&#150;1993), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 26 November 1910 in Durban, South Africa, the son of James Cusack, an Irish officer with the Natal mounted police, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cole, a Cockney music-hall dancer. After the break-up of his parents' marriage in 1916 Cusack spent a peripatetic childhood, initially in Ireland, touring with his mother and her actor-lover, Brefni O'Rourke. Having made his stage d&eacute;but in Tipperary as Little Willie in <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> (1916) he went on to play countless juvenile roles in melodramas staged in &#145;fit-ups&#146; such as barns and pubs. He even portrayed a girl in <span class="italic">Shot at Dawn</span> and the cat in <span class="italic">Dick Whittington</span>. During a performance of the latter his tail became entangled in a roller curtain and he was &#145;left suspended in the air and had to be rescued by the second comedian&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 July 1990). By this time he had already begun what turned out to be the longest screen career of any British-based performer. However, his d&eacute;but in Fred O'Donovan's <span class="italic">Knocknagow, or, The Homes of Tipperary</span> (1918) was hardly a model of realism, as the rudely healthy Cyril was cast as an evicted waif left desolate by the roadside.<br>
<br>Yet, this &#145;glorious adventure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Oct 1993) seriously disrupted Cusack's education, as he recalled in &#145;Every week in a different school&#146;, an essay in <span class="italic">A paler shade of green: a unique study of the dominant expatriates of the world Irish arts scene</span> (1972). Speaking in a mixture of his mother's Cockney accent and O'Rourke's brogue, Cusack (who was also fluent in Gaelic) eventually settled into a council school on the Caledonian Road in north London, where he told his classmates &#145;how wonderful Ireland was, how there were Red Indians in Wicklow and how I had seen a lion near the mountains. I almost believed the stories myself. It was my incipient nationalism coming out&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 July 1990). After returning to Ireland in the early 1920s he enrolled in the Dominican College at Newbridge, co. Kildare, and from there entered University College, Dublin, to read politics, modern history, and Roman law, with the intention of applying for the bar. However, his extra-curricular activities soon took precedence, as he published a volume of poetry and appeared in such plays as W. B. Yeats's <span class="italic">The Pot of Broth</span>.<br>
<br>It was clear, therefore, that acting was in Cusack's blood, as he recalled towards the end of his life: &#145;It always was. I could never get away from it. Sometimes I think acting is my <i>first</i> nature, not my second&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 July 1990). So he joined his mother and O'Rourke on their summer excursions to Norwich and Windsor, before making his London bow with a last-act cameo in Arnold Bennett's <span class="italic">Milestones</span>. However, it was in Ireland that he found his feet, as he appeared frequently with his mother's company at the Queen's Theatre and toured with Jimmy O'Brien's troupe. His big break came with his d&eacute;but at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in 1932. He played two small parts in A. P. Fanning's one-act piece <span class="italic">Vigil</span>, but the director listed him twice in the programme, as Cyril Cusack and Cyril O'Rourke.<br>
<br>Over the next thirteen years, Cusack performed in sixty-five productions at the Abbey, although he also spent two seasons at the Gate Theatre, particularly impressing as Paris opposite Mich&eacute;al Mac Liamm&oacute;ir in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. His stock was also rising in London, with his efforts in <span class="italic">Ah, Wilderness</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Thunder Rock</span> (1941) drawing critical acclaim. Yet it was with Irish drama that he was most closely associated. He excelled as Covey in Sean O'Casey's <span class="italic">The Plough and the Stars</span> (1939), and rejected an offer of Hamlet in order to play Christy Mahon in J. M. Synge's <span class="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</span> (1938). But it was his St Patrick's day performance as Dudebat, opposite Vivien Leigh in George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span>, at the Haymarket in 1942, that made the most headlines. Having spent lunchtime sampling illicit whiskey with his stand-in, Cusack already felt unwell as the play began. By the scene in the artist's studio, he started misquoting his lines and was forced to improvise. Eventually he dried altogether and began delivering dialogue from <span class="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</span>. The curtain was brought down and the stage manager sent out the equally inconvenienced understudy to complete the show. Next day, both Dudebats were fired by the formidable impresario Binkie Beaumont, and Cusack entered a twenty-year West End exile.<br>
<br>In 1945 Cusack married the actress Maureen Margaret Kiely (<i>d</i>. 1977); they had three daughters, Sinead, Sorcha, and Niamh, and two sons, Paul and Padraig. In the same year as his marriage Cusack severed his links with the Abbey, following a row over his insistence that a national theatre had a duty to tour the provinces. He had a spell managing the Gaiety Theatre, during which he premiered Synge's <span class="italic">The Bishop's Bonfire</span> (1955). He also formed his own production company, and began appearing regularly in films to finance roving programmes of classical and Irish dramas. Lamenting the scarcity of Irish pictures, he mostly worked in England in such diverse projects as <span class="italic">Odd Man Out</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Elusive Pimpernel</span> (1950), <span class="italic">The Man who Never Was</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">The Waltz of the Toreadors</span> (1962). &#145;In my film parts,&#146; he said, &#145;I have concentrated on veracity of characterisation. In the last few years, I think my work in films has improved in some ways; it is more solid, less intuitive and perhaps technically better than it used to be&#146;  (Cusack, 30). Invariably cast in supporting roles, he effortlessly stole scenes with his customary economy and ease. Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut, who directed him in <span class="italic">Fahrenheit 451</span> (1966), wrote of him:<blockquote>Cyril Cusack is the most restless actor I have known. He is a man of good nature and mildness. He can play his scenes in so many styles; he can be baroque, malicious, lyrical, but he can never be terrifying. (Cusack, 24)</blockquote>Perhaps the most telling description of his method came in a review of his performance in a 1988 Abbey production of Gorky's <span class="italic">The Lower Depths</span>&#151;&#145;His touch is light like a feather, but it has the impact of an electric volt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Oct 1993).<br>
<br>The 1960s proved something of a golden age, which Cusack labelled his &#145;second apprenticeship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Oct 1993). In 1961 he not only won the International Critics' Award as the best actor of the season in <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span> and <span class="italic">Krapp's Last Tape</span> (both 1960), but also premiered <span class="italic">The Temptation of Mr O</span> (1961), a play based on Kafka's <span class="italic">The Trial</span>, which he wrote in rhythmical prose and Dublinese. Two years later he returned to the London stage as Mobius in the Royal Shakespeare Company's Aldwych production of D&uuml;rrenmatt's <span class="italic">The Physicists</span> (1963), and helped restore Boucicault's <span class="italic">The Shaughraun</span> to the international repertory with his 1968 performance as Conn. Whether on film in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Galileo</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Day of the Jackal</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">My Left Foot</span> (1989), or on stage as Fluther Good in <span class="italic">The Plough and the Stars</span> (1977), and The Inquisitor in <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> (1984), he continued to garner acclaim. Particularly admired was his Chebutykin in Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Three Sisters</span> (1990), which co-starred his daughters Sinead, Sorcha, and Niamh. His wife Maureen having died in 1977, in 1979 he married Mary Rose, with whom he had a daughter, Catherine.<br>
<br>Despite plans to concentrate on writing, Cusack persisted in acting almost to the end of his life, appearing with his grandson Sam in <span class="italic">Danny, the Champion of the World</span> (1991). He died of motor neurone disease at 41 Burlington Lane, Chiswick, London, on 7 October 1993. He was survived by his second wife, Mary, and by his six children. A memorial mass was concelebrated at the Church of Corpus Christi, Covent Garden, on 4 November 1993.<br>
