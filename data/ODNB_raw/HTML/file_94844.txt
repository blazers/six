<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aprahamian,  (Apraham) Felix Bartev</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">music critic and concert organizer</span>, was born on 5 June 1914 at 16 Inderwick Road, Hornsey, London, the son of Avedis Aprahamian, formerly Hovhanessian (<i>b</i>. 1871), carpet dealer, and his wife, Araxie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garabedian. His parents were both Armenian immigrants from Turkey. In 1919 the family moved to 8 Methuen Park, Muswell Hill, London, where Aprahamian lived for the rest of his life, for many of the later years sharing his house with his widowed mother. He was educated at Tollington School, Muswell Hill, where he developed a love of music, particularly organ music, so strong that it was detrimental to his schoolwork. On leaving school he was found a job by his father as an office boy in Fenchurch Street, then Mincing Lane, but he had no real interest in business. Meanwhile he took organ lessons, and became lifelong friends with another organist, William Lloyd Webber, father of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. He was assistant secretary of the Organ Music Society from 1931, and secretary from 1935 to 1970. In these capacities he began an extensive correspondence with composers, conductors, and musicians, both in Britain and elsewhere (particularly France), which he preserved (along with diaries, notebooks, autographs, and scores) in an ever-burgeoning archive in Muswell Hill. In 1933 he and two friends visited Frederick Delius at Grez-sur-Loing, and on the same trip he sat in an organ loft beside Charles-Marie Widor.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Aprahamian served as concert director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and as an ARP warden. He also, with Tony Mayer, the cultural attach&eacute; at the French embassy, organized an extensive series of concerts of French music, including contemporary music, and broadcast for the BBC in French, in which he was fluent. He came to be most closely associated with the promotion of French music, and, during the war and later, organized concerts for, and got to know, all of the leading lights of contemporary French music. He played host to Messiaen and his wife, and liked to point out to visitors the plane tree outside his house where Poulenc had relieved himself.<br>
<br>From 1946 to 1984 Aprahamian acted as a consultant to United Music Publishers, the principal publisher of French music in the UK; he kept an office there, which he used primarily as a base from which to promote French music. He pursued a parallel career as a music critic, having penned his first contribution to the music press in 1931. From 1948 to 1989 he was deputy music critic on the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, initially working under the increasingly eccentric Ernest Newman; later, in 1956 and 1958, he edited two volumes of Newman's essays. His own reviews were appreciated for their elegance, perceptiveness, and breadth of interest. He also wrote record reviews for <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span> from 1964 to 1975, and innumerable programme notes, which were invariably stylishly written and informative. His career as a music critic was not without controversy. He was dropped by <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span> for failing to meet deadlines, and by the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> for submitting a review of a Gennady Rozhdestvensky concert when Rozhdestvensky had in fact cancelled the concert because of illness.<br>
<br>Bespectacled, with a neatly trimmed goatee beard, and frequently in the evenings dressed in white tie and opera cloak, Aprahamian was an exotic and larger-than-life character, and a raconteur of notable wit. He had many friends, and was a hospitable host at his home in Muswell Hill. He kept two pianos and an organ there, the latter brought from the Basque country in 1982 specifically for the use of Aprahamian's friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; David Liddle (who later took Aprahamian as a middle name). He also held open house for younger scholars and enthusiasts anxious to make use of his archive of scores and other materials. The &#145;conversation &hellip; at the kitchen table would always range from the extremely intellectual and musically involved, through to the most uproarious and ribald&#146;  (Liddle). He published <span class="italic">Conversations with Olivier Messiaen</span> in 1976, a translation of Claude Samuel's original, and selections of his correspondence with Messiaen, Poulenc, and Charles Tournemire were published in 1998, 2000, and 2003, edited by Nigel Simeone.<br>
<br>Aprahamian reputedly refused appointment as an OBE in 1987, but in 1996 became officier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres, in recognition of his promotion of French music. He lectured widely, including at Morley College and Surrey University. From 1989 he was a visiting professor at the University of East London, and in 1991 at the University of California. He received an honorary doctorate from City University in 1995. His last years were clouded by a series of strokes, with increasingly debilitating effect. He died on 15 January 2005 at St Mary's wing, Whittington Hospital, Islington, London, of heart failure. He never married and had no known descendants.<br>
