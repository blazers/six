<span class="headword">Argyle,  Jesse William</span>  (1859&#150;1924), <span class="occ">social investigator and statistician</span>, was born at 7 Argyle Road, Mile End, London, on 4 September 1859, the elder of two sons of Jesse Smith Argyle (1834/5&#150;1866), a grocer's travelling salesman, and his wife, Martha Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mattocks. After their father's death Jesse and his brother were brought up by their grandfather James Argyle and his wife Eliza James. He attended St John's College, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, as a servitor. By 1881 he was living in Colchester, Essex, employed as a newspaper compositor. In 1888 he married Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), daughter of Richard Condron, master brushmaker, and had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Argyle became an employee of Charles Booth at some point during the early 1880s. In August 1885 Booth seconded him as a young clerk in the Booth shipping company to the Mansion House relief inquiry set up to investigate the causes of destitution in London. He showed considerable flair for the kind of work involved&#151;inspecting and analysing the 1881 census returns&#151;and in the following year Booth decided to employ him on his own inquiry into the condition of the London poor. In the interim Booth offered Argyle's services as a research assistant to Beatrice Potter (later Webb): &#145;Could Argyle help to work up your sketch of the legislation of the last fifty years or did you get enough done yourself &hellip; to prove that &#147;we are not governed by general principles&#148; beyond controversy?&#146;  (Charles Booth to Beatrice Potter, 27 July 1886, Passfield MSS II I (ii) 8). Beatrice responded positively and Booth arranged for Argyle to do the work. Beatrice, who had initially doubted the suitability for the task of research in the British Museum of this &#145;East-end lad made good&#146;, reported back enthusiastically to Mary Booth, one of Argyle's most ardent admirers. When Booth began his work on Tower Hamlets in 1886 it was with Jesse Argyle as one of his chief assistants, with Argyle organizing the inquiry office, first at Talbot Square and then at Adelphi Terrace, Strand.<br>
<br>From 1885 onwards Jesse Argyle was a welcome visitor at the Booth family home, where his sense of humour was much appreciated. A favourite family anecdote reported in the demotic his preference for pudding: &#145;Oy'll troy a little poy if you please Mrs Bewth&#146;  (Norman-Butler, 117). Mary Booth described him as sharing her husband's &#145;zeal for the good of the people&#146;, regarding him as &#145;able, sympathetic and independent-minded&#146;  (M. Booth, 20). In his turn Argyle acknowledged Charles Booth's (&#145;the Chief's&#146;) generosity to him.<br>
<br>Jesse Argyle gradually emerged from his apprenticeship on the <span class="roman">Poverty Series</span> of Charles Booth's survey to become a social investigator in his own right. His interview notebooks, presented in a clear, large, flowing hand, reveal him as active and perceptive. He was given sole responsibility for the inquiry into Walthamstow and special districts of west and north London. Argyle was also responsible for anything between a third and a half of the research underlying the survey of the boot and shoe trade, which was published in 1892 under David Schloss's name. In that year he became a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. Under his own name he contributed important sections to the <span class="roman">Industry Series</span> of <span class="italic">Life and Labour of the People in London</span>. He was involved in the Toynbee Economic Club and in March 1896 gave a lecture entitled &#145;The attractiveness of London to provincial labour&#146;. He undertook much of the interviewing of clergy for the <span class="roman">Religious Influences Series</span> and commented in detail on the draft chapters.<br>
<br>Argyle continued to play a key part in organizing Charles Booth's publications and seeing them through the press. In 1902 and 1903, working alongside Mary and others, he brought together a definitive and agreed version of the <span class="roman">Religious Influences Series</span> and the <span class="roman">Star Volume</span> text, parts of which were in an untyped and rough draft, for the only entire edition of <span class="italic">Life and Labour</span> (1902&#150;3). Although Booth was undoubtedly the &#145;Chief&#146; of his inquiry, the coherence and clarity of the published text of this enormous undertaking owed much to Argyle, his lieutenant. On 19 July 1904 the culmination of the great inquiry was marked by a celebration, involving dinner at the Savoy and a trip to the opera; for Argyle and his wife this was a high point of Argyle's own career.<br>
<br>Jesse Argyle suffered from chronic bronchitis and dyspepsia. Health concerns may have contributed to his death by suicide on 28 July 1924. He jumped from Archway into the Archway Road and died from shock and multiple injuries. At the time of his death he was living at 66 Hornsey Lane, Islington. According to his death certificate he was a journalist and was described as of &#145;unsound mind&#146; by the deputy coroner for London at the inquest on 31 July 1924.<br>
