<span class="headword">Noonan <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Croker]</span>,  Robert Philippe</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Robert Philippe Tressell]</span>  (1870&#150;1911), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born Robert Philippe Croker on 18 April 1870 at 37 Wexford Street, Dublin. But the vastly influential novel for which he is known&#151;<span class="italic">The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</span>&#151;was published posthumously and his true identity remained hidden until forty years after his death. He was the illegitimate son of Samuel Croker, a substantial man of property, resident magistrate, and retired inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary, and Mary Noonan. Two other children were born from this union. Robert's father died when he was a boy, and his education, though good, was incomplete. By all accounts he was an exceptional linguist and skilful artist, but he served no apprenticeship despite working as a signwriter and housepainter from leaving school at sixteen until his death. In 1890 he emigrated to South Africa, where he lived comfortably and bought a plot of land. On 17 October 1891 in Cape Town he married Elizabeth Hartel (<i>b</i>. 1872/3); they had a daughter, Kathleen, the following year, but Elizabeth died shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>Noonan, as he now called himself, raised Kathleen alone, supplementing his artisan's income through journalism. In 1896 he moved to Johannesburg in the Transvaal, where with John (Sean) MacBride (executed in 1916 for his part in the Dublin Easter rising) and Arthur Griffiths, later president of the Irish republic, he helped form the Irish brigade, which fought against the British in the South African War. Before hostilities began in 1899, Noonan had returned to Cape Town and thence to Britain, where he settled in Hastings in 1901. Working in the building trade at subsistence wages, he contracted tuberculosis, was influenced by socialist writers such as Robert Blatchford, and became an active member of the unusually large Hastings branch of the Social Democratic Federation, whose banner he painted. He spent his spare time during the last ten years of his life writing by hand the 1800-page manuscript of <span class="italic">The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</span>, which brought posthumous fame. In 1910, when his daughter was eighteen, Noonan determined to make a new start in Canada, but <i>en route</i> he was taken seriously ill in Liverpool, where, after living for a while in a workhouse, he died in the Royal Infirmary on 3 February 1911; he was buried in a pauper's grave in the city's Walton Park cemetery. In 1913 his daughter, Kathleen, sold his manuscript outright for &pound;25 to the publisher Grant Richards, whose editor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98109/', "Jessie Pope")</script> cut the text to about 100,000 words; and this &#145;damnably subversive, but &hellip; extraordinarily real&#146; novel (as Richards described it) was published in April 1914.<br>
<br>Although the title page of the manuscript is clearly signed Tressell (which was how Noonan wrote the word for a painter's trestle in his manuscript), for some unknown reason the author's name was printed as Tressall in the first edition and in the Grant Richards abridged cheap edition of 1918. Sardonic and satirical in tone, the novel's great strength is its minute and convincing observation of the hero's workmates, whose &#145;philanthropy&#146; consists of letting employers reap the surplus value their labour produces. Its political argument, though crude, is powerful, and the use of names&#151;Crass, Didlum, Graball, Slyme, and Sweater all live in Mugsborough&#151;redolent of John Bunyan and Charles Dickens. The story covers a year in the life of Frank Owen, who tries to arouse his workmates to the evils of the system which exploits them, helped by the mysterious Barrington, an educated, middle-class man, who is another <i>alter ego</i> for the author. A clear, convincing, and often poignant narrative emerges; but Tressell was not a great creative writer and his development of plot and character is much weaker. Moreover, the inability (implied in the title) of the working class ever to see beyond their immediate circumstances makes their acceptance of socialism seem unlikely and gives the novel a pessimistic context. Nevertheless, it presents a unique view of early twentieth-century working-class life through the eyes of an articulate proletarian.<br>
<br>Reissued many times between the wars, <span class="italic">Philanthropists</span> was published in Canada, Germany, and the United States, with pirated translations appearing in Romania and the Soviet Union. Penguin Books published the abridged version in April 1940. By then it had sold, at a conservative estimate, more than 100,000 copies. Penguin reprinted it in May 1940, January 1941, and May 1942, with an Australian edition in October 1942, all widely read and lent on by soldiers during the Second World War, while the Richards Press printed eight abridged editions between 1944 and 1951, with a final Richards original version in 1954. By then F. C. Ball, who had spent his life researching Tressell, had fixed beyond reasonable doubt his Croker&#150;Noonan identity and, equally important, located his manuscript. This was finally published in full (with his pseudonym spelt properly at last) in 1955 by Lawrence and Wishart, who subsequently reprinted it many times. This full text has been published in the Soviet Union and translated into Bulgarian, Czech, French, German, Japanese, and Swahili. Stage adaptations have been frequent since the 1920s. BBC television broadcast one in 1967, the year in which Tressell's daughter, Kathleen, who was believed to have died in 1918, returned from years spent in Canada and was interviewed by a reporter from <span class="italic">The Times</span>; she later confirmed most of the facts of Tressell's life which F. C. Ball had established by years of tireless work.<br>
