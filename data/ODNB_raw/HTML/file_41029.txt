<span class="headword">Barr <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Huddleston]</span>,  Amelia Edith</span>  (1831&#150;1919), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 29 March 1831 in Ulverston, Lancashire, the daughter of Mary Singleton (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;<i>c</i>.1858) and William Henry Huddleston (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1863), a Methodist minister. Her father's vocation required the family to move frequently; she spent her early childhood in Shipley, Yorkshire, began school at Penrith in Cumberland, moved to Ripon, Yorkshire, and then to Castletown, on the Isle of Man. It was while living in Castletown, she recalled in her autobiography, <span class="italic">All the Days of my Life</span> (1913), that &#145;I began to seriously try to write&#146;  (Barr, 58). At sixteen, when her father lost his independent fortune through a friend's fraud, she went as a teacher to a boarding-school in Downham Market, Norfolk. The family fortunes were partially restored a few months later by a gift of property from her mother's uncle, but upon seeing her father, not her mother, draw the first rents to cover his losses, she learned the lesson that a married woman's property was not her own.<br>
<br>Determined to support herself, Amelia Huddleston returned to teaching; when the school employing her failed, she entered the normal school at Glasgow, leaving after a few months to marry, on 11 July 1850, Robert Barr (<i>d</i>. 1866), a local businessman. When Barr's woollen mills failed, she urged him to emigrate, and they sailed for New York city, arriving in September 1853. They first established themselves in Chicago, Illinois, where she opened a school for girls; leaving hurriedly after her husband made enemies, they paused in Memphis, Tennessee, before moving on to Texas, finally settling in Austin. She moved to Galveston, Texas, in 1866 with her husband and five surviving children (she had already lost a daughter in Chicago and two more children in Austin), where almost immediately Robert Barr, her two sons, and another newborn boy died of yellow fever.<br>
<br>With three daughters to support, Amelia Barr returned to New York in 1868, where she at first made her living as a teacher. Encouraged by one of her employers, who told her &#145;If you can write, you can live&#146;  (Barr, 311), and by Henry Ward Beecher, whom she had met briefly years before in England, she began placing stories in magazines. She confined herself to essays and stories for more than a decade before publishing her first novel, <span class="italic">Jan Vedder's Wife</span> (1885), which firmly launched her career as a writer of popular historical romances set in England and the United States. Among her more than sixty other books were <span class="italic">The Bow of Orange Ribbon: a Romance of New York</span> (1886), <span class="italic">The Maid of Maiden Lane</span> (1900), and <span class="italic">Remember the Alamo</span> (1888), the latter surviving to inspire a film in the 1960s starring John Wayne. As a reviewer of <span class="italic">Bernicia</span> (1895) observed, she had found a formula and, &#145;standing always well within its clearly defined lines, continue[d] to give out the white bread and cream which a large public has learned to expect and to enjoy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookman</span>, 167). The formula's steady proceeds allowed her to maintain a country house, Cherry Croft, at Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York. A heat stroke in July 1918 proved to be her final illness; Amelia Barr died on 10 March 1919 in Richmond Hill, Long Island, New York, and was buried on 13 March in Sleepy Hollow cemetery, near Tarrytown, New York.<br>
