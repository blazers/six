<span class="headword">West <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cooke]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1790<span class="mult">x</span>95&#150;1876), <span class="occ">actress</span>, the only daughter of Isaac Cooke, a master upholsterer and amateur actor in Bath, and his wife, Martha, was born in Bath either in 1790 or in 1791 (she died aged eighty-five, according to her death certificate) or on 22 March 1795. Her mother was descended from a Gloucestershire family. Her cousin was the actress Harriet Cooke, later Waylett. On 22 May 1810 she appeared, not very successfully, at the Bath Theatre, for the benefit of her actor uncle James, as Miss Hardcastle in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>. In the next year at the same house she was Emily Tempest in the <span class="italic">Wheel of Fortune</span>. In the summer of 1812 she played at Cheltenham and Gloucester under Watson. She was seen by Charles and Maria Kemble, who formed a very favourable opinion of her and recommended her to Harris at Covent Garden, where she made her London d&eacute;but on 28 September 1812 as Desdemona. Various roles followed with mixed success, Oxberry saying that &#145;she somewhat bordered on the mawkish&#146;. Next season she was Fanny Sterling in the <span class="italic">Clandestine Marriage</span> and the first Georgiana in <span class="italic">Folly as it Flies</span>. She moved to Edinburgh where she was Juliet on 10 November 1814 for ten nights in succession. The coldness of Scottish criticism was thawed into a tide of approbation. In March 1815 in the English church in Edinburgh she married <a href="#cosubject_29105">William West [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a musician and comic actor who played simple lads and country boys. Stanzas by &#145;J. M.&#146; on her Edinburgh performances were printed in Oxberry's <span class="italic">Dramatic Biography</span>. She proceeded to Bath where she remained for two seasons, in a variety of parts, enjoying patronage and many friendships. On 17 September 1818 she made, as Desdemona, her first appearance at Drury Lane with Elliston. Leading parts, mostly tragic, were assigned to her. Sarah Siddons and Elizabeth Kemble publicly expressed high appreciation of her rendering of Belvidera in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>. She supported Kean in many parts. In October 1818 she was Lady Macbeth to his Macbeth, but he remarked that he did not think she would shine in characters of that class although she was excellent in the tender parts. She spoke eloquently on 31 October 1820 at the family benefit for Alexander Rae with whom she and Kean had appeared in <span class="italic">Lear</span>. From 1820 to 1828 at Drury Lane, with occasional appearances at the Haymarket, she played many different parts, some original. After this time her recorded performances were scanty. In 1835 she was at Covent Garden under Osbaldiston playing only secondary parts. Thereafter she was at minor theatres or in the country. Her last London engagement was at the Marylebone about 1847. She parted early from her husband, with whom she had two sons. She died on 30 December 1876 at 24 St George's Road, Glasgow, the house of her great-nephew Henry Courte Cooke, and was buried at Sighthill cemetery on 2 January 1877.<br>
<br>Sarah West was of average size, had eloquent eyes, a transparent skin, and brown, luxuriant hair. She was said to be the most beautiful woman of whom the stage of the time could boast and a fine tragic actress. She was, however, not at her best in parts which called for passions other than love. Her Lady Macbeth was tame and unreal, and she was accused of &#145;ranting&#146; in her later career. In comic parts she was refined but only moderately humorous.<br>

<a name="cosubject_29105"></a><span class="headword">William West</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Father of the Stage]</span>  (1797/8&#150;1888), <span class="occ">actor and composer</span>, lived to be called the Father of the Stage. His father was connected with Drury Lane. After studying music under Thomas Welsh and C. E. Horn he appeared at the Haymarket in 1805 as Tom Thumb. He then at Drury Lane played parts such as Juba in the <span class="italic">Prize</span> and Boy in <span class="italic">Children in the Wood</span>. In 1814 he followed Sarah Cooke to Edinburgh, and the next year married her in the teeth of much competition. His first appearance in Edinburgh was on 10 November 1814 as Don Carlos in the <span class="italic">Duenna</span>. After playing in Bath and Bristol he appeared in London at the East London Theatre, and on 9 May 1822 at Drury Lane played Lord Ogleby in the <span class="italic">Clandestine Marriage</span>. He also acted at the Olympic and other theatres. He gave in 1842 an entertainment illustrative of the clowns of Shakespeare. For some time he was a teacher of music. He died at 45 Tavistock Crescent, Kensington, London, on 30 January 1888, aged ninety. His most popular songs were &#145;When love was fresh from her cradle-bed&#146;, &#145;Alice of Fyfe&#146;, and &#145;Love and the Sensitive Plant&#146;. His glees included &#145;The Ocean King&#146;, &#145;Up Rosalie&#146;, &#145;Oh, Bold Robin Hood&#146;, and &#145;The Haaf Fishers&#146;. He was also responsible for a sonata entitled &#145;Maid Marian&#146; and <span class="italic">An Ancient English Morris Dance with Variations</span>.<br>
