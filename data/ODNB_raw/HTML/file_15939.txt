<span class="headword">Lambert <span class="st"> [Lambart]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1619, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">parliamentary soldier and politician</span>, was baptized on 7 September 1619 at Kirkby Malhamdale, near his home at Calton, Yorkshire. Lambert (who sometimes spelled his name Lambart) was possibly the younger son from Josias Lambert's second marriage, to Anne Heber. The family had been established at Calton by his great-grandfather, also John Lambert (<i>fl</i>. 1516&#150;1566). It is probable that Lambert was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and at the inns of court before returning to Yorkshire to marry Frances Lister (<i>d</i>. 1676), daughter of Sir William Lister of Thornton in Craven, on 10 September 1639. This marriage cemented his links with the Lister family that had been established before the death of his greatly indebted father, Josias, in 1632. The Lister connection brought him further into the orbit of some of the leading Yorkshire gentry families such as the Fairfaxes and Belasyses. With the outbreak of civil war Lambert aligned himself, with his Lister kin, with the forces of Lord Fairfax.<h2>
<a name="Militaryandearlypoliticalcareer"></a>Military and early political career</h2>Lambert was immediately a very active participant in the numerous skirmishes and battles of the northern army. He was noted for his part in the sally from Hull (11 October 1643) and at the battle of Nantwich (25 January 1644), and he played a prominent role in the successes at Bradford (March 1644) and Selby (April 1644). At Marston Moor Lambert was part of the right wing of cavalry that was routed by Goring but which with Sir Thomas Fairfax and five or six troops forced itself through the royalists and joined Cromwell's victorious left wing. Following Sir Thomas Fairfax's appointment as commander of the New Model Army Lambert, then commissary-general of Lord Fairfax's army, was temporarily in charge of the northern forces. In March 1645 he was wounded when Sir Marmaduke Langdale raised the siege of Pontefract. In January 1646, with the end of the war in the north, Lambert was given the command of Montagu's foot regiment in the New Model and participated in the south-west campaign.<br>
<br>Lambert's conduct during his successful military career marked him out for increasing political employments. Recovering from injury in London during December 1644 Lambert kept Sir Thomas Fairfax informed of political developments, including the self-denying ordinance. (In this and his few other remaining letters of this period he signed himself Lambart.) At York in 1644 Lambert had been one of the treaty negotiators. He later acted in this role, alongside Henry Ireton, at the capitulations of Truro, Exeter, and Oxford, in the last of which he remained as governor. Such employments established links between leading army officers, particularly Ireton and Lambert, and those royalists such as Sir John Berkeley who came to favour negotiation with them.<br>
<br>With the dispute between parliament and army in 1647 Lambert was prominent among the officers who opposed enlisting for Ireland before their demands had been met. On 17 April 1647 a meeting of over 100 officers chose a powerful committee, including Lambert, to represent their views. Lambert and the committee of officers represented the sense of the army in <span class="italic">The Petition and Vindication of the Officers of the Armie</span>, which was laid before parliament on 27 April. The regiments proceeded to make their grievances known through regimental returns. Lambert was very active in organizing and directing this action. On 15 May in Saffron Walden church the officers met to listen to these regimental grievances. Colonel Sheffield and other &#145;presbyterian&#146; officers questioned the right of Lambert and others to collect these regimental grievances without informing the troops fully of parliament's latest offers. Lambert in turn told them they had cut themselves off from their comrades by volunteering for Ireland and by their failure to endorse the army's March petition. A committee was formed, including Lambert, to present a summary of the regimental returns. In <span class="italic">A Vindication of 167 Officers</span> (26 June 1647) Lambert was accused of manipulating the presentation of the regimental returns. The unity of the army was restored however by the resignation of Sheffield and other like-minded officers in the face of the determination of Lambert and the majority to resist parliament. On 2 July Lambert was one of the five army commissioners in the first meeting to treat with parliament's commissioners. At a council of war at Reading on 5 July Lambert was also one of the officers appointed to draw up charges against the eleven members whom the army branded &#145;incendiaries&#146;.<br>
<br>It is in line with these employments, and his collaboration with Ireton, that Lambert's contribution to the projected settlement of 1647 needs to be considered. In June 1647 Lambert and other officers met the king at Childerley Hall, near Cambridge. When Charles arrived at Newmarket, Lambert, with Colonel Robert Hammond, took him a message from Fairfax. The result of the army's control of the king was <span class="italic">The Heads of Proposals</span>, which according to Berkeley &#145;Ireton had drawn&#146;, though probably with some input from the army's allies in parliament  (&#145;Memoirs of Sir John Berkeley&#146;, 363). Bulstrode Whitelocke believed Lambert had assisted Ireton in drawing up the heads, and when Ireton presented them to the army council on 17 July 1647 it was Lambert who clarified some issues for Cromwell  (Firth, 1.212).<br>
<br>When, in the summer of 1647, the northern forces revolted against their commander Poynts and sought firmly to align themselves with the New Model, Lambert was sent north to command them. His close links with the northern troops, established since 1642, and in particular with those, such as Captain John Hodgson, who had led the revolt against Poynts, coupled with his leadership skills, quickly calmed the situation in the north. Indeed at the time some believed his appointment was due to his connections with the &#145;adjutators&#146; in the northern forces. Lambert succeeded in disbanding the supernumerary forces, restoring discipline, and mending the relationship with the civilian population, leading to him receiving much praise for his &#145;fairness, civility and moderation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Diurnall</span>, 13&#150;20 Sept 1647, 1734).<br>
<br>With the revolt of northern royalists and the invasion of Hamilton's Scottish army in July 1648, Lambert once more showed himself to be a skilled military leader. He forced Langdale into Carlisle before capturing Appleby and neighbouring castles. Lambert's military strategy around Carlisle forced the Scots to advance to Langdale's aid before their army was properly prepared. In the face of the royalist control of Pontefract, the defection of Scarborough, and the weight of Hamilton's forces Lambert led an organized retreat of his forces to Bowes and Barnard Castle, aiming to hold Stainmore Pass against Hamilton. From there he had to retire further to Richmond and then Knaresborough. There, on 13 August, Cromwell arrived, and their combined forces defeated the Scots at Preston (17&#150;19 August 1648). Lambert pursued Hamilton, who surrendered at Uttoxeter (25 August 1648). In October 1648 Lambert was sent to Edinburgh with an advance party of six regiments of horse and one of dragoons to support Argyll's party.<br>
<br>Lambert supported the <span class="italic">Remonstrance of the Army</span> (16 November 1648), and <span class="italic">The Declaration of Lambert's Brigade</span> (12 December 1648) justified the army's actions and expressed the bitterness felt by army officers towards parliament. Although named to the court to judge Charles I, Lambert was preoccupied by the northern royalist revolt and particularly the siege of Pontefract, whose resistance he finally ended in March 1649. He did not however oppose the court's proceedings or the subsequent execution of the king.<br>
<br>During the invasion of Scotland in 1650&#150;52 Lambert, now a major-general, was second in command to Cromwell but emerged as the leading fighting commander, even to the extent of being judged to have saved the ailing Cromwell and the English forces from disaster. Still only thirty-one, Lambert's military genius became more evident as the campaign proceeded and as the 51-year-old Cromwell's health collapsed. Taking over command of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3419/', "John Bright's")</script> foot regiment Lambert again led his forces from the front, being twice wounded and briefly taken prisoner at Musselburgh (30 July 1650). At Dunbar (3 September 1650), according to Captain John Hodgson, Lambert, backed by Cromwell, persuaded the council of war to adopt the tactics which ultimately led to victory. Having spent most of the previous day observing the Scottish forces Lambert saw how their left wing, being piled up against the steep slope of Spott Burn glen, would be unable to assist their right wing if subjected to a concentrated attack. Lambert was nominated to head the English attack and implement this plan. Lambert led a brigade of three regiments to secure the pass over the Berwick Road which would protect the passage of the main force across Spott Burn ford so that it could fall on the Scots' right. Following an hour-long struggle Lambert's brigade achieved its objective but was then charged by the Scots' cavalry. When Lambert was reinforced by Major Packer, leading Cromwell's horse regiment, the Scots were pushed back. A second combined horse and foot charge ensured the collapse of the Scots' right. The rest of the Scottish forces were then engaged and crushed.<br>
<br>Lambert followed the victory at Dunbar with further blows against Scottish forces. On 1 December he routed an attack on his quarters at Hamilton, destroying the western army and capturing its leader, Colonel Ker. With further success at Aire, Lambert secured the surrender of Colonel Strachan. Briefly in charge of all forces during Cromwell's illness, Lambert forced the surrender of Blackness.<br>
<br>July 1651 witnessed Lambert's most notable personal victory. Managing to cross over into Fife, something which Cromwell and Monck had previously failed to achieve, Lambert, though outnumbered, destroyed a force of 4000 led by Sir John Browne at Inverkeithing. Deciding not to occupy the town Lambert prepared to defend the excellent ground provided by the Ferry hills. Lambert, with a few of his cavalry, led the Scots towards his main body and a party of infantry set to ambush them. Receiving news that Cromwell had withdrawn to Linlithgow and would not be reinforcing him, Lambert, rather than facing being trapped on a peninsula, decided to attack. Concentrating three-quarters of his total force on his right wing and leaving his left wing to prevent him being outflanked Lambert charged up the face of the ridge on the heights of which the Scots had drawn up. Two thousand Scots were killed and Lambert took between forty and fifty colours and 1400 prisoners. &#145;Such was the gallantry of Major-General Lambert, that had it not been for his armor he had been lost, a brace of bullets being found between his coat and his arms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 24&#150;31 July 1651, 965). Inverkeithing was a decisive victory. At the time it was seen as ending all of Charles II's hopes of using the Scots to secure his three kingdoms; and more recently the victory has been seen as more decisive than Dunbar.<br>
<br>With Charles II now forced to advance into England Lambert, with Cromwell's cavalry, harried his rear and succeeded in joining with Thomas Harrison at Warrington (15 August 1651) briefly to check the Scots. At Worcester Lambert captured Upton Bridge (28 August 1651), thus securing passage of the Severn for the English forces. Ludlow claimed that Lambert was prominent in the tactical decisions for the attack on Worcester. During the actual assault on Worcester (3 September 1651) Lambert's horse was shot from underneath him.<br>
<br>Lambert's military record bears comparison with that of any of his contemporaries. By the time of Worcester, although still only thirty-two, Lambert had been in arms for nine years. The enthusiasm of his troops to serve under him was testimony not only to his care of them but also to an awareness of his tactical appreciation and the preparation that preceded his most notable successes at Dunbar and Inverkeithing, crucial elements in a general campaign that otherwise would have seen an ageing Cromwell out-generalled.<h2>
<a name="Entryintocivilianpolitics16511653"></a>Entry into civilian politics, 1651&#150;1653</h2>Lambert did not hold a civil office of real political importance until he became one of the eight commissioners for Scotland on 22 October 1651. He was widely seen as the unofficial head of the commissioners for Scotland and his main task was to prepare for the union of the two former kingdoms. At the same time he still led the army in suppressing those Scots who held out. It was while settling Scotland that, on 23 January 1652, Lambert, following the death of Ireton, was appointed lord deputy of Ireland.<br>
<br>Lambert arrived in London on 24 February to prepare to leave for Ireland. When he bought the rectory of Wimbledon on 13 May Lambert was referred to in the deed of enrolment as the lord deputy  (TNA: PRO, C54/3676/23). On 17 May it was reported that Lambert would begin his journey on 24 May. On 19 May, however, parliament, which had appointed him for only six months, &#145;considered of the businesse of Ireland, and passed a Vote, that no Commission be granted to any Lieutenant of Ireland after the expiring of the present Commission to the Lord Deputy Lambert&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Diurnall</span>, 17&#150;25 May 1652, 1887). Lambert was offered the posts of commander-in-chief and commissioner for the civil government. These appointments would simply have made him <i>primus inter pares</i> in the Irish council. Lambert refused the commission and Cromwell secured the place for Charles Fleetwood, but requested that &pound;2000 out of his arrears as lord lieutenant should go to Lambert. Following Lambert's refusal of the lesser post he also declined a similar position in Scotland. Despite the fact that he held no official position in either country, Lambert was later to be heavily involved in the affairs of Scotland and Ireland through his role on the council of state under the protectorate. It was he who reported on the ordinances for the Union with Scotland, chaired the committee on Irish lands, and headed the Irish committee.<br>
<br>Some contemporaries believed the loss of the lord deputy post was due to Cromwell and that when Lambert later realized this it began the rift between the two men. Lucy Hutchinson, who attacked Lambert for laying out &pound;5000 on his preparations, believed that this had all been a scheme of Cromwell's to get the position for Fleetwood, who had recently married Cromwell's daughter, and Ireton's widow, Bridget. In connection with Fleetwood's appointment, Hutchinson remarked on the bitterness between Frances Lambert and Bridget Fleetwood. Edward Ludlow regarded this episode as a design by Cromwell to turn Lambert against the Rump, and he claimed that Lambert now began to press Cromwell for the dissolution of parliament.<br>
<br>Whatever Cromwell's part in the revocation of the Irish post, the political manoeuvres of the republicans in the Rump and especially those of Sir Arthur Hesilrige also played a part. Between Hesilrige and Lambert there was real animosity. On 31 January 1652 Hesilrige was appointed president of the council of state for a month. In early February the house debated a report recommending Lambert as commander of military forces in Ireland. The tellers in parliament for the motion to abolish the post were Hesilrige and Henry Marten. However, Lambert, like many in the army, had other reasons for antagonism towards the Rump. Legislation that the army had pushed for had been long delayed. Even that which was passed, for example the <span class="roman">Act of General Pardon and Oblivion</span> (24 February 1652), did not fully meet the demands of the army. Since Worcester the army had wanted fresh elections and a new parliament. The revocation of the Irish post just added to Lambert's frustration with parliament.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1653, when Cromwell first dissolved the parliament and then moved on to dismiss the council of state, Lambert and Harrison were with him. Harrison's wish for a council of seventy was opposed by Lambert, who believed power should be entrusted to a much smaller body of about ten or twelve. The subsequent parliament of 139 &#145;puritan notables&#146; appeared to signify a defeat for Lambert. Although elected to the interim council of state for the first time in April 1653, where he was its first president, co-opted to sit as an MP in July, and chosen for the first council of state, appointed on 9 July, Lambert took no part in Barebone's Parliament once it was convened. It was said that &#145;Lambert forbeares the Parlt and Councel much of late, he solaces at Wimbleton, and hath the visits of the most eminent of the Northerne Gentry&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 46, fol. 113). Lambert was not chosen as a member of the second council of state (1 November).<h2>
<a name="TheInstrumentofgovernmentandtheestablishmentoftheprotectorate"></a>The Instrument of government and the establishment of the protectorate</h2>From mid-October at the latest Lambert was preparing an alternative settlement. He appears to have been biding his time while the radicals in parliament discredited themselves. On 19 November he returned from Yorkshire. On 24 November it was reported that &#145;There hath been some late discontents between the General and Harrison in so much as Harrison is retired, and its said Lambert is sent for up hither&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 47, fol. 113). The council had sent for Lambert and on 23 November appointed a committee under Cromwell to confer with him and other officers concerning the Scottish situation.<br>
<br>The moderates in the parliament, led by Sir Charles Wolseley, William Sydenham, Sir Gilbert Pickering, Edward Montagu, Philip Jones, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, Henry Lawrence, and John Desborough, all of whom were on the council of state and would be on the new council established under the protectorate, organized a resignation and abdicated their power to Cromwell. Colonel Goffe and Lieutenant-Colonel White entered the parliament with musketeers and dispersed the members who had remained there. It is most likely they were acting under orders from Lambert. It is perhaps significant that in council on 26 December it was ordered that &#145;the warrant issued by Major-General Lambert on 12 December for restraining all boats and vessels from the port of Dover, be taken off&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653</i>, 311). One contemporary simply commented, &#145;what Lambert hath aimed at he has affected&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 1.632).<br>
<br>Lambert's settlement, the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;, introduced on 16 December, was the written constitution that was the foundation of the protectorate. At the installation of Cromwell as protector it was Lambert who had a prominent place in the proceedings. He rode with Cromwell in his carriage and it was Lambert who handed Cromwell the sword of state. At the time there was comment that Lambert was to be made a duke and general of the three nations and would be the next protector. However, the army was not one united body behind the instrument. In the hectic days before 16 December accounts state that Lambert was presenting the majority of officers with a <i>fait accompli</i>. The most visible army opposition came in the three colonels' petition (18 October 1654). Most disagreement was based on the power given to the single person, especially the power to oppose parliament. It was also noted that Cromwell's successor, probably Lambert, might use the army totally to destroy parliaments.<h2>
<a name="Theheightofhispower16531657"></a>The height of his power, 1653&#150;1657</h2>Lambert's central role in the new regime is demonstrated by his activity in council, membership of key committees, and by his role in promoting important ordinances made by the council before 3 September 1654. For example, Lambert was on committees for chancery regulation, the duchy court, and the regulation of JPs. He was also involved in the army committee and in managing the affairs of Ireland and Scotland. He was also on all the committees considering how best to raise the necessary moneys to fund the army, navy, and civil administration. Indeed, the reorganization of the exchequer has been seen as a significant achievement of the protectorate, and his part in this was central. Alongside this Lambert played a key role in the establishment of Durham University.<br>
<br>The instrument, through its separation of the legislative and executive powers and its concentration of authority in the council as a body and not in the protector, placed tight restrictions on Cromwell's position. In the months leading up to the first protectorate parliament Lambert had his wish of a small council controlling affairs and ruling by ordinance. Contemporaries clearly saw Lambert as the dominating influence in the protectorate, appearing to be semi-independent of Cromwell through his various offices and increasing wealth. Lambert was a major-general, colonel of two regiments, a leading member of the council, warden of the Cinque Ports, and was estimated to have an income of about &pound;6500 per annum.<br>
<br>Despite Lambert's influence the protector was far from being controlled by him and the protectorate councillors were not a unified group following a single line. Indeed, most had stronger links with Cromwell than with Lambert. There was policy disagreement, Lambert's opposition to Cromwell and other councillors' determination to follow the &#145;western design&#146; being a notable example. Gradually, however, a much more serious rift opened between Lambert and Cromwell with regard to their respective views on the nature of a political settlement.<br>
<br>The pragmatic imposition of central government on the localities through the major-generals has widely been attributed to Lambert, though it was probably a wider council measure. Lambert was, however, prominent in the introduction of the original and the additional instructions of 22 August and 4 October 1655 and 19 June 1656. He was major-general of five northern counties&#151;Yorkshire, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Northumberland&#151;but, because of his other duties, this work was undertaken by two deputies, colonels Charles Howard and Robert Lilburne. When the major-generals came under attack in parliament Cromwell abandoned them and thus piqued Lambert. Lambert vigorously defended them and pushed for the decimation tax to be continued: &#145;The quarrel is now between light and darkness, not who shall rule, but whether we shall live or be preserved or no&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.319). Lambert and the major-generals believed that they could control parliament, through the elections and expulsion, and that the issue over the direction of settlement had finally to be decided. When the parliament reassembled it was clear that the major-generals had not got the house they wanted. Cromwell's opposition to decimation and the militia severely undermined Lambert's position. The outwardly religious dispute that followed merely deepened the split.<br>
<br>When Lambert's former quartermaster, the Quaker James Nayler, was brought before parliament accused of &#145;horrid blasphemy&#146; Lambert, who was on close terms with many of radical religious views, was the leading officer to support him. His own religious preferences, behind his outward latitudinarianism, remain as obscure as they were to his contemporaries, who regarded him at various times as anything from a Catholic to an atheist. Lambert's position with regard to the Nayler case needs to be seen in light of the disputes over the major-generals and decimation. For Lambert the constitutional issues crucially underpinned the religious issues. The political framework of Lambert's instrument was the safeguard for a tolerant religious approach. A close associate of Lambert, Adam Baynes, made the point that &#145;for the Instrument of Government says, all shall be protected that profess faith in Jesus Christ&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.59). The essence of Lambert's defence of Nayler was that he did not want parliament to have unlimited judicial power. He was worried that future parliaments might attempt to prosecute those who had acted in the name of past parliaments. The instrument had, in part, sought to counter the power of parliament with a more influential council.<h2>
<a name="Kingshipandresignation1657"></a>Kingship and resignation, 1657</h2>Cromwell's apparent indecision over whether to take the title of king seems to have driven the final wedge between the two men. Although Cromwell asserted that the title of king had been in an early draft of the instrument, in 1657 Lambert led the army's opposition to kingship, a crucial factor in Cromwell's decision not to accept the title. Some contemporaries believed Lambert's opposition was not motivated by principle. Similarly they attributed his removal from office to Cromwell's fear of what he might achieve. That he was solely motivated by ambition would be a misreading of the issues at stake. Lambert saw that kingship represented a wholesale shift towards civilian government. The main issue for Lambert was that those who had won the war, the military, had to maintain a powerful voice in government. The men behind &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146; could not be expected to act as trustees of the army's interest.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1657 parliament decided to impose an oath on all councillors. Lambert opposed this move, refused to take the oath of loyalty required by the new constitution, absented himself from the meetings of the council, and removed himself to Wimbledon. On 23 July 1657 Cromwell sent for him to resign his commands.<h2>
<a name="Wealthandfinancialactivities"></a>Wealth and financial activities</h2>Lambert's estate at the outbreak of civil war was worth less than its nominal &pound;300 value. Lambert claimed that the military impact of the civil war lessened its value further as well as disrupting the wool trade in which he had an interest. However, the success he made of his military career and his subsequent political role saw a significant rise in Lambert's fortunes. Lambert was attacked as one of the officers whose &#145;parks and new houses and gallant wives had choked them up&#146;  (Griffith, 18&#150;19). As well as his army pay Lambert received various gifts and grants of land for his military success, the most notable being &pound;300 p.a. of land in Pontefract and &pound;1000 p.a. in Scotland (9 November 1651). His new wealth was spent on various purchases such as Kirkby Malhamdale fee-farm rent, Ampleforth, Braunton Dean, and Nonsuch as well as works of art, through Baptist Gaspars, fine clothing, and books.<br>
<br>However, there was a less obvious element to Lambert's participation in land speculation. Lambert acted on behalf of his kin in relation to property in Ripon, Burton, Wennington, and Ecclesall. A notable example was his securing of Sheriff Hutton for the royalist Sir Thomas Ingram. Similarly, he acted with various royalists, including his Catholic kinsman John, Lord Belasyse, to secure property for the Vavasors. Such actions belie his increasingly hardline public attitude to royalists. They are, however, in line with the workings of his kinship network prior to 1642 which had kept his own estates secure following the death of his father. They are also mirrored by the actions of his royalist kin, Belasyse and Ingram, after the Restoration to protect Lambert's estates during his long imprisonment. Kinship was thus a determining factor in many of Lambert's investments.<br>
<br>The most notable of Lambert's purchases was the manor of Wimbledon. Following his purchase of the rectory of Wimbledon Lambert, on 17 May 1652, purchased Wimbledon House, formerly belonging to Henrietta Maria, for &pound;16,822 17<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. It was there that Lambert tended his notable gardens and followed his artistic pursuits. Lambert is most associated with the Guernsey lily, <i>Nerine sarniense</i>, and his gardening led him to be satirized in 1660 as the Knight of the Golden Tulip, but, following his dismissal, it also was an opening for royalist advances to him. As lord of the manor Lambert held regular manor courts under his own steward, a fellow soldier, William Claxton.<h2>
<a name="Reemergenceanddefeat16581660"></a>Re-emergence and defeat, 1658&#150;1660</h2>Despite Lambert's dismissal in July 1657 Cromwell allowed him a pension of &pound;2000 per annum. Some saw this as a means to prevent any further opposition from Lambert. The royalists tried to exploit Lambert's dismissal but despite numerous royalist approaches, including a scheme by which his eldest daughter would be married to either Charles II or the duke of York, Lambert kept to his gardens. In the last six months of his life Cromwell received Lambert at Whitehall and appears to have attempted a reconciliation. It was recorded that &#145;Cromwell fell on his neck, kissed him, inquired of dear Johnny for his Jewell (so hee calls Mrs Lambert) and for all his children by name&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 57, fols. 175&#150;6).<br>
<br>With Richard Cromwell as protector Lambert slowly returned to national politics. Sitting in the 1659 parliament as MP for Pontefract Lambert spoke in favour of Richard but also sought to limit his powers over the military and his negative voice in legislation, commenting that &#145;The best man is but a man at the best. I have had great cause to know it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 3.189). Lambert also objected to the admission of the Irish and Scottish members and generally he appears to have been trying to ingratiate himself with the republican grouping.<br>
<br>Despite having no official position within the army Lambert maintained some contacts with those junior officers intriguing at Wallingford House. His exact role in their pressure which led to the dissolution of parliament (22 April 1659) is, however, not clear. When the junior officers forced the recall of the Rump, Lambert was restored to his commands and became colonel of two regiments. Naturally for someone of his ability and past record as soon as he had been invited onto the general council Lambert took a leading role. He was prominent in the negotiations which preceded the restoration of the Rump, and in the presentation of the army's declaration to Lenthall which invited the Rump to return (7 May) and a larger declaration which stated their political demands (13 May). The restored parliament made Lambert a member of a committee of safety (9 May) and council of state (13 May) as well as a member of the seven-man commission for the nomination of officers (4 June). Lambert's response to the long-delayed <span class="roman">Indemnity Act</span>, however, reflected his continued ambivalent attitude to parliaments. &#145;I know not why they should not be at our mercy as well as we at theirs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.100).<br>
<br>Despite this, parliament had little choice but to send Lambert, its most capable commander, to face the rising of Sir George Booth. Lambert efficiently destroyed Booth's forces at Winwick Bridge, Cheshire (19 August), before recapturing Chester (21 August) and Chirk Castle (24 August). Lambert used the &pound;1000 jewel parliament had voted him to pay his troops. These troops took up Fleetwood's submission to the parliament that Lambert be made, once more, a major-general.<br>
<br>This demand, with calls for godly reform, a senate, a proper command structure, and for no officer to be dismissed without court martial, was voiced in Lambert's officers' Derby petition. Although Lambert's role in this was unclear it aroused further suspicion of his motives among many MPs who had long feared his talents and questioned his ambition. Such doubts could only have been heightened by Lambert's strengthening of his links with Sir Henry Vane when he returned to London, for both favoured rule by a small &eacute;lite. The general council of the army, however, vindicated the petition and repeated its request for arrears. When parliament learned that Lambert, Desborough, and other leading officers were seeking subscriptions to their petition they cashiered Lambert and those whom they regarded as his accomplices (12 October 1659). In response, Lambert appealed to the troops around London, most of whom responded and marched on Westminster with him. On 13 October Lambert's force surrounded the regiments of Morley and Moss and the Horse Guards that were drawn up to protect parliament. Finding the gate of Scotland Yard barred by the Horse Guards Lambert walked forward to them alone and persuaded the soldiers to join his own. When Lenthall arrived to attempt to enter parliament Lambert ordered him home. Hesilrige and the MPs soon capitulated and ordered their last defenders, Morley's troops, back to quarters. As they marched out of Westminster Hall these troops gave Lambert an ovation. Lambert now recovered his position as a major-general and became a member of the committee of safety which took over from parliament's council of state.<br>
<br>This body sent Lambert to deal with the advancing forces of Monck, who had declared for parliament (3 November). For Monck, Lambert in many ways represented the factors that had driven him to declare for parliament, the spectre of military rule and particularly the increasing Quaker threat, many being in his forces and his attitude to the sect seemingly tolerant. Although Lambert had a larger force he sought to avoid conflict. His delay saw the disintegration of his army, which, unlike Monck's, had not received any money. Fleetwood and Desborough in London had an increasingly fragile grip on power and as Portsmouth (3 December) and the fleet (13 December) declared for parliament the troops in London itself also acknowledged its authority (24 December). When Lambert's old commander Thomas Fairfax led the Yorkshire gentry in support of parliament (1 January 1660) the Irish brigade in his forces deserted him and his force dissolved. Offered a general indemnity, along with all his soldiers, Lambert submitted. Ordered to retire to his Yorkshire house (26 January), Lambert was further ordered to repair to Holmby, Northamptonshire. This was followed by a proclamation for his arrest (13 February) claiming that he had been in London provoking a mutiny. When he appeared before the council of state on 5 March Lambert hoped to be permitted to enter the Swedish army but he was unable to meet the &pound;20,000 security demanded of him and was placed in the Tower.<br>
<br>On 10 April Lambert escaped from the Tower and attempted to rally forces against the approaching Restoration, staging a rendezvous at Edgehill. Lambert's actual aim was unclear, his personal motivation was still questioned, and his increasing identification in many minds with the Quaker threat meant he was an isolated figure. Despite this he still managed to assemble a number of officers and about six troops of horse. However, these soldiers had no will to fight when approached by troops under colonels Ingoldsby and Streeter near Daventry (22 April). Lambert was taken prisoner and escorted to London. At forty-one his career was over.<h2>
<a name="Trialimprisonmentanddeath16601684"></a>Trial, imprisonment, and death, 1660&#150;1684</h2>Although not a regicide, Lambert was initially excepted by the Commons from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> for punishment not extending to life, but when the Lords voted that he be wholly excepted both houses then stated that if he was attainted they would petition that the death penalty be remitted. Lambert was sent from the Tower to close confinement in Castle Cornet, Guernsey, in October 1661. His wife, Frances, petitioned that she and their ten children be allowed to reside in a house that the king had allowed him to have. On 17 February 1662 a licence for Frances and three of her children &#145;to go and remain with her husband&#146; was directed to Sir Hugh Pollard, then governor of Guernsey  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 276). In July 1661 the Cavalier Parliament demanded that Lambert should be proceeded against. After repeated requests Charles II finally agreed to bring Lambert back from Guernsey.<br>
<br>At the start of April 1662 the duke of York sent ships for Lambert and Vane, who was imprisoned on the Isles of Scilly, to be returned to the Tower for trial. On 25 April the then governor of the Tower, Sir John Robinson, received a warrant to allow Lambert's wife and her children &#145;to have access to her husband, and to converse with him in the presence of his keeper&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 350). Lambert was arraigned in the king's bench for high treason. On 19 June Lambert stood before the bar,<blockquote>trying to excuse and justify the crimes of which he was accused. He was for all the world not upset about them and did not speak to deny his deeds, but tried all the time to make them appear less serious, and appealed to the King's Mercy, by which he won the judges' hearts. (Exwood and Lehmann, 92&#150;3)</blockquote>Although Lambert was sentenced alongside Vane to be executed, the king commuted his sentence to life imprisonment. He was returned to Castle Cornet.<br>
<br>At times Lambert was allowed out of close confinement. In 1663&#150;4 Frances petitioned that she be allowed to live with her husband, whom she felt should have more liberty because he was ill. A warrant allowing Lambert more liberty was issued in November 1664. At times of danger, however, Lambert was put under increased scrutiny. When a plot to free him was discovered in late 1664 it was ordered that he &#145;be kept a close prisoner and if at any time an enemy should appear before the island that he be shot for having had correspondence with the king's enemies&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 47, MS calendar). Again at the time of a threatened invasion in July 1666 orders were given that Lambert should be shot if troops arrived on the island. One of the reasons given by Charles II for dismissing Lord Hatton as governor was his failure to keep a strict vigilance over Lambert. Given Hatton's pre-1660 links with Lambert and the marriage of Mary Lambert to one of his sons, Charles Hatton, the authorities were also probably worried about his loyalty.<br>
<br>During his long imprisonment it is clear that Lambert's financial problems and general affairs were managed by those who had been part of his kinship circle before the civil war and others with whom he had become connected as a result of his military and political career. In December 1667, after an appeal by Lord Belasyse, Viscount Fauconberg, and Sir Thomas Ingram, Lambert was allowed to take a house with his wife and family on the island. Of Lambert's kinship circle, also notable in helping him were his sons-in-law: John Blackwell, Daniel Parrott, John Hooke, and Dr Daniel Cox. In 1670 Lambert was transferred to St Nicholas Island. While he was imprisoned off Plymouth, Samuel Pepys, Miles Halhead, James Yonge, Charles II, and the duke of York are all recorded as having visited Lambert. In 1676 his wife, Frances, died. Lambert remained imprisoned on St Nicholas Island until his own death in March 1684. He was buried in St Andrew's parish church, Plymouth.<br>
<br>Lambert played a significant role in the events of 1642&#150;60. Militarily he ranks with any of his contemporaries and during the Scottish campaign he arguably surpassed his older commander Cromwell as the leading general of the English forces. His evident military genius and care for his troops saw him worshipped by them and described by one contemporary as the &#145;Armyes Darling&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 131, fol. 189). It was this military genius and popularity alongside his youthful dynamism, rather than a close relationship with Cromwell, that saw him rise to the height of his power in the 1650s. However, it was the very same factors that also earned him the distrust of many. This in turn, when added to his general religious tolerance and personal links with those of Catholic to Quaker beliefs, while appearing to hold no firm views himself, was to prove fatal to his cause in 1659&#150;60. Although an aesthete his experience since 1642 ensured he would always seek to preserve military influence in government. Politically Lambert is most remembered as the author of the instrument and as prominent in the establishment of the protectorate, but this is to overlook the scale of his general role, especially in the years 1653&#150;7, when, still in his thirties, he was one of the most influential men in the state and would almost certainly have been chosen by the council as protector if Cromwell had died at this point. The survival of a Lambertian protectorate, however, would, as the events of 1659&#150;60 suggest, have been limited by his narrow power base.<br>
