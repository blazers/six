<span class="headword">Gallaher,  Thomas</span>  (1840&#150;1927), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer</span>, was born on 27 April 1840 in the townland of Templemoyle, near Eglinton, co. Londonderry, the fourth of the ten children of Thomas Gallaher (<i>d</i>. 1855), corn miller, and his wife, Martha. Both his parents were Irish. The younger Thomas was educated privately, and at an early age helped in the substantial family business. He later recalled that, aged twelve, he had been &#145;gaffer&#146; in charge of fifty men. On the death of Thomas senior, the mill passed to his second son, John, the eldest son, Alexander, having entered the Anglican church. Unwilling to accept a subsidiary role within the firm, Thomas established himself independently.<br>
<br>During an apprenticeship with Osborne and Allen, general merchants, of Londonderry, Gallaher learned the techniques of tobacco manufacture. In 1857, with &pound;200 borrowed from his mother at 5 per cent interest, he established his own business in the city. It was an opportune period: from the early 1850s tobacco consumption <i>per capita</i> in Ireland rose steadily, doubling by 1900. Through energy and hard work&#151;Gallaher later claimed to have worked seventeen hours a day&#151;he earned a reputation for producing pipe tobacco far superior to the adulterated product common in Ireland, and built a small export trade to Britain. In 1863 he moved to Belfast, which offered an expanding market and better port facilities. The firm prospered, and in 1873 Thomas married Robina Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1930), with whom he had five daughters and a son, who predeceased him. In 1881 a factory employing 600 workers was constructed in Belfast, replacing hand-operated methods of production with power-driven machinery. During the next decade, following visits by Thomas to America, the firm acquired plantations and stemming factories in Kentucky and Virginia, which he personally supervised. In 1888 premises were established in London, employing 200. In 1896 a new factory was built in Belfast and the company acquired limited liability status. Gallahers had become the largest tobacco firm in Ireland and was one of the biggest in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>In 1898 Thomas's position in the industry was recognized when he became chairman of the National Association of Tobacco Manufacturers. Yet he refused to join the Imperial Tobacco Company founded in 1901 to combat American competition. Gallaher believed the firm's interests were still predominantly Irish, and Imperial was seen as a British organization. Furthermore, Thomas did not relish playing second fiddle to the Wills family. The decision had no adverse effects, though Gallahers had to beat off a challenge from the American Tobacco Company by producing (under the &#145;Park Drive&#146; brand) machine-made cigarettes, which Thomas had originally despised.<br>
<br>During the years before 1914 the firm expanded its markets in Britain, the empire, America, and Scandinavia. The 1920s saw difficulties for the company, however, and Gallaher was, by then, old and troubled by heart problems. There were losses in the southern Irish market following boycott and partition, and increased competition in Britain. After Thomas's death the company's position improved. In 1928 it became public when the Gallaher family sold its holding to a consortium. The move proved decisive in the firm's fortunes, its share of the tobacco market increasing throughout the 1930s.<br>
<br>Gallaher's business interests were not confined to tobacco. He was for a period chairman of the Belfast Steamship Company. In this capacity he came into conflict with James Larkin, the radical Irish trade union leader, who had been sent from Liverpool to organize dock labourers into trade unions. Gallaher was recognized as a good employer, even by the Belfast socialists like William Walker, but he was against trade unions&#151;&#145;Do not argue&#146; was one of the mottoes displayed in his Belfast factory&#151;and resisted Larkin's attempt to unionize the labour force. The ensuing conflict escalated into a bitter industrial struggle, involving most of the workers employed in unloading and transporting goods in Belfast. The dispute spilled over into Gallaher's tobacco factory. Seven girls who attended one of Larkin's meetings were suspended from work, and 1000 walked out in sympathy. The strike eventually petered out, however, and the labour force returned to work.<br>
<br>Gallaher never claimed to be a technical innovator, attributing his success to hard work and an ability to grasp market opportunities; but, as his dealings with Larkin showed, he could be ruthless. He was, nevertheless, the first employer in the tobacco industry to reduce the working week from fifty-four to forty-seven hours. Perhaps his greatest achievement was to create, in Belfast, a non-sectarian workforce, something requiring both moral and physical courage. On one occasion he kept an agitator out of the factory only by acquiring a pistol and threatening to shoot him. Gallaher died on 3 May 1927 at his home, Ballygoland House, Greencastle, near Belfast, aged eighty-seven. He was buried at Belfast city cemetery.<br>
