<span class="headword">Wharton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lee]</span>,  Anne</span>  (1659&#150;1685), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Ditchley Park, Oxfordshire, on 20 July 1659. Her father, Sir Henry Lee (1637?&#150;1659), of Ditchley, had died four months earlier; the death within days of her mother, Anne Danvers (1636&#150;1659), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7135/', "Sir John Danvers (1584/5&#150;1655)")</script>, the regicide, left her and her elder sister Eleanor (1657&#150;1691) coparcenary heirs to the vast wealth of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7133/', "Henry Danvers, earl of Danby (1573&#150;1644)")</script>, which had been left to his sister by Danby's heir male, his nephew Henry Danvers (1633&#150;1654). Both girls were placed by their mother's will under the guardianship of her mother-in-law, twice widowed Anne, countess of Rochester (1614&#150;1696), mother by her second husband, Henry Wilmot, created earl of Rochester in 1652, of the poet Rochester. In her expert hands both motherless girls thrived, but there is little evidence of any formal education for either. When the countess was appointed groom of the stole to the duchess of York in recompense for her role in the complicated dealings that had left her old friend Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, in possession of the principal Danby estate of Cornbury Park, her wards receiving the confiscated estate of Sir John Danvers in exchange, the Lee girls appear to have accompanied their grandmother to the court of St James's. When in the country they lived with their guardian at the Wilmot house at Adderbury which, after having served as a billet for both sides in the civil war, had been left virtually ruinous before the countess had it rebuilt, and, with the benefit of the Lee girls' money, magnificently refurbished.<br>
<br>A principal source for the biography of the poet is the correspondence of Sir Ralph Verney, who was one of her trustees, and John Cary of Woodstock, who acted as steward of Adderbury. In August 1672 thirteen-year-old Anne Lee spent three months at Bath being treated for a virulent sore throat; in September of the following year, against the wishes of the king, who was promoting a match with the heir of Sir John Arundel of Trerice, she was privately married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29175/', "Thomas Wharton (1648&#150;1715)")</script>, who, contrary to the provisions of the will of his mother, Jane Goodwin, who stipulated that her considerable estate be shared with his brother Goodwin Wharton (1653&#150;1704), was created for the purpose sole heir of his father, Philip, fourth Baron Wharton (1613&#150;1696), leader of the country party in the House of Lords. According to the unreliable autobiography of Goodwin Wharton, besides being debauched when very young by Henry Mordaunt, second earl of Peterborough (1624?&#150;1697), Anne had &#145;lain a long while by her uncle Rochester&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 26006, i, 308). Her elegy on the death of the poet in 1680 is evidence of her deep attachment to him; in it she claims that he taught her to write poetry. The sight of her elegy in manuscript prompted poetic responses from John Grubham Howe and Edmund Waller. In March 1681, after recurrent episodes of acute illness, she was escorted by her husband to Paris for medical treatment. Before it could be completed he required her to return to England; with her she brought her verse paraphrase of the <span class="roman">Lamentations</span> of Jeremiah which she showed to the nonconformist divine Samuel Clark, who responded that it would &#145;afford more comfortable reflections at a dying hour, than conversing with what belongs only to, or is fit for the Theater&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Rawl. MS, letters 53, fols. 351&#150;2), implying both that her verse play, &#145;Love's Martyr, or, Wit above Crowns&#146; (BL, Add. MS 28693), was written before this date and that she was not expected to recover.<br>
<br>In July 1682 Mrs Wharton began a correspondence with Gilbert Burnet, who showed her verse paraphrase of <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 53 to Edmund Waller who wrote his two cantos &#145;Of Divine Poesy&#146; in response. After Burnet's flight to Holland, Mrs Wharton engaged in a poetic correspondence with William Atwood and became involved in the project to stage Rochester's <i>rifacimento</i> of Fletcher's <span class="italic">Valentinian</span> which was acted by the United Company at the Theatre Royal on 11 February 1684. In his preface to the printing of the play Robert Wolseley represents himself as acting upon instruction; an exchange of poems between Wolseley and Mrs Wharton reinforces the suspicion that the instruction came from her. By the summer of 1685 she was once more gravely ill and betook herself to Adderbury so that she could drink the waters at nearby Astrop. Her condition worsened; for weeks she lay racked with agonizing seizures. On 29 October she died, and on 12 November she was buried in the Wharton family vault under the chancel of the church of St Mary Magdalen at Winchendon, Buckinghamshire. At the reading of her will it was discovered that she had left her whole fortune, beyond some personal legacies to servants and &pound;3000 to Rochester's daughter by Elizabeth Barry, to her notoriously neglectful and unfaithful husband. Though the countess of Rochester repeatedly besought the earl of Abingdon, since 1672 husband of Mrs Wharton's sister and coheir, and her grandson, Edward Henry Lee, earl of Lichfield, to bring an action to overturn the will, it was never contested. In February 1686 Master William Phillips entered a caveat in the Stationers' register preventing any member of the Stationers' Company from publishing &#145;a play called <span class="roman">Love's Martyr</span> &hellip; and other poems written by the Honnoble Mrs Wharton&#146;. Anne Wharton's surviving <i>&#339;uvre</i> consists of twenty-four poems, all but five of which were printed in miscellanies in the years following her death, her play, seven letters to her husband, and one to Sir Ralph Verney.<br>
