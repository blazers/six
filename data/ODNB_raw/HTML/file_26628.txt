<span class="headword">Stradling, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1563&#150;1637), <span class="occ">scholar and politician</span>, was the son of Francis and Elizabeth Stradling of St George's, near Bristol. He was later adopted by Sir Edward Stradling (with whom he shared a great-grandfather), the childless possessor of large estates in Glamorgan. Stradling was educated at Bristol by Edward Green, a canon of the cathedral, and then at Oxford. He matriculated at Brasenose College on 18 July 1580 and graduated BA from Magdalen Hall on 7 February 1584. During his studies at Oxford he was regarded as &#145;a miracle for his forwardness in learning and pregnancy of parts&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 2.396). As an undergraduate he was a member of the Michelbournes' group of Latin epigrammists, which included Campion and Fitzgeffrey; he is said to have been a fellow of All Souls. He studied for a time at one of the inns of court (possibly Middle Temple) and then travelled abroad. In London he was well regarded by William Camden, John Harington, Thomas Leyshon, and other scholars. On his return he lived with his uncle at St Donats, Glamorgan, mixing estate administration with his continuing studies.<br>
<br>Stradling was particularly drawn to the work of the neo-Stoic and greatest Senecan scholar of the age, Justus Lipsius. The first Lipsius translation he published was <span class="italic">A Direction for Travailers</span> in 1592; it was dedicated to the young earl of Bedford, the son-in-law of Stradling's friend John Harington. Shortly afterwards he translated Lipsius's <span class="italic">Politicorum</span> but the appearance of William Jones's edition in 1594 put paid to any plans to publish. In the same year he made a birthday present of his translation of <span class="italic">De constantia</span> to Sir Edward, who arranged for its publication; perhaps in an attempt to stress his prodigality he stated that it was the product of only five weeks' work. <span class="italic">De constantia</span> explained Stoic philosophy for Christian readers and professed to present a synthesis of the best of both traditions. Stradling's first original work was <span class="italic">De vita et morte contemnenda</span>, published in Frankfurt in 1597. Modelled on <span class="italic">De constantia</span> it takes the shape of a dialogue between Stradling and John David Rhys. The argument leans much more heavily towards Christianity than Lipsius's work. Stradling followed this with a volume of Latin epigrams in 1607.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1599 Stradling married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Gage of Firle, Sussex. She was the niece of his adoptive mother; they had four daughters and nine sons, including the royalist naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26627/', "Sir Henry Stradling")</script>. The Stradlings were staunchly royalist, although his granddaughter Elizabeth (daughter to his eldest daughter, Jane) was the wife of the regicide Edmund Ludlow. Stradling's involvement in the administration of the family estates is evidenced in a composition first written in 1598, revised in 1601, and dated &#145;From my studie in your [Sir Edward's] castle of St Donats&#146;. <span class="italic">The Storie of the Lower Borowes of Merthymawr</span> describes Sir Edward's successful assertion of a claim to the Lower Burrows and narrates the tortuous course of the legal dispute. It lay in manuscript and was not published until the 1930s.<br>
<br>Stradling was knighted in 1608 and his uncle's death the following year saw his succession to one of the largest gentry estates in Wales. He oversaw the completion of the foundation of Cowbridge grammar school. He was created a baronet in 1611 and stood fifth on the first list of them. As might be expected he was heavily involved in county politics; he was sheriff of Glamorgan in 1607, 1609, and 1620 and is known to have been deputy lieutenant in 1626, although he probably had held that office for many years previously. As a client of the third earl of Pembroke he was MP for St German's, Cornwall, in 1624&#150;5 and for Old Sarum in 1625, before being elected for Glamorgan in 1625&#150;6. He was a very active member, being on over fifty minor committees and deputations during the time he sat for Glamorgan. Particularly interesting, given his strong support for James I's peace policies, is his involvement in committees concerned with the prosecution of the war. His shifting view of war can be seen in the difference between his volume of English verse <span class="italic">Beati pacifici</span> of 1623 and the manuscript &#145;A political discourse or dialogue between a knight of the Commons-house of parliament and a gentleman, his friend, being a moderate Roman Catholic&#146; of 1625. By the time of the latter he cautiously asserts that Spain's intransigence had made peace impossible. He published a further volume in English, <span class="italic">Divine Poemes</span>, in 1625.<br>
<br>By the early 1630s Stradling seems to have given way to his heir in politics and administration. He died in 1637 and his burial took place at St Donats on 4 September. According to Sir John Harington:<blockquote>whether it proceeded from the greatness of his parts, the agreeableness of his temper, or the generality of his studies; we shall hardly find any gentleman whatsoever, that among all the eminent scholars of that age, men of very different professions, and very disagreeable studies, appears by his writings to have gained so universal respect and esteem. (J. Harington, &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">Sermons of Revd George Stradling</span> [Stradling's son])</blockquote>
