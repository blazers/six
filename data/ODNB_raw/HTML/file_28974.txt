<span class="headword">Weir,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1670), <span class="occ">criminal and reputed sorcerer</span>, was the son of Thomas Weir of Kirkton, near Carluke in Lanarkshire. At the time of his trial in 1670 he was described as &#145;past the age of 70&#146; and &#145;of great age&#146;  (Scott-Moncrieff, 2.10&#150;11). The family land was sold in 1636, and in February 1642 Weir married Isobel Mein, the widow of John Bourdoun, an Edinburgh merchant, entitling himself to become a merchant burgess. He served in the Scottish army in Ireland in 1642&#150;3, and in 1644 was a major in the Scots army in England.<br>
<br>When the radical covenanting kirk party regime seized power in 1648 it was decided to raise a guard to protect Edinburgh, and on 25 October Weir was given command of this burgh guard. His duties included guarding parliament from January to March 1649, but on 9 May orders were given for paying off Weir and his men. It was later to be asserted that he had had charge of the royalist marquess of Montrose during his imprisonment before his execution in May 1650, and had treated him harshly. Certainly Weir remained closely associated with security in the burgh, and when in 1650 levies were ordered to counter the anticipated English invasion he was appointed major (third in command) of the burgh's forces (7 August).<br>
<br>In 1650&#150;51 the Church of Scotland split into two conflicting factions and Weir gave his allegiance to the uncompromising remonstrant minority. His zeal survived the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and he was by then living in the West Bow of Edinburgh, an area favoured by the &#145;saints&#146;&#151;those who retained allegiance to the later generally discredited covenants. James Fraser (minister of Wardlaw) recalled seeing him in 1660: &#145;His garb was still a clock [cloak], and somewhat dark, and [he] never went without his staffe. He was a tall black [dark] man, and ordinarily looked down to the ground: a grim countenance and a big nose.&#146; His prowess in prayer led some to call him &#145;Angelicall Thomas&#146; (Fraser, fols. 156<i>r</i>&#150;158<i>r</i>; Wilson, 2.158).<br>
<br>In 1670 Weir suddenly began to exhibit terror at the word &#145;burn&#146;, presumably in fear of the fires of hell, and began to confess to many sexual crimes. At first the authorities regarded him as mad, but after he had been examined by physicians he was judged to be sane. On 9 April 1670 he was tried before the justiciary court for &#145;Incests, Adulteries, Fornications, and Bestialitys&#146;. Charges included attempted incest with his sister Jean when she was aged about ten, and actual between 1620 (when she was sixteen) and 1624, at the family &#145;House of Wicketshaw&#146;, the relationship continuing intermittently for many years; incest with his stepdaughter Margaret Bourdoun; habitual adulteries, persisted in even when &#145;he was of great age&#146;; bestiality with a mare in 1651 at Newmylns in Ayrshire, and lying with &#145;Cows and other beasts&#146;. His outward piety and professions of purity beyond other men were denounced as aggravating such offences  (Scott-Moncrieff, 2.10&#150;11).<br>
<br>Weir, by now sunk in despair, failed to plead directly to the charges, although he said that &#145;he thinks himself guilty of the forsaid Crimes and cannot deny them&#146;  (Scott-Moncrieff, 2.12), but his confessions had been detailed, specific and consistent, and some aspects of them were corroborated by confessions by his sister Jean, who had lived with him. She also related how they had once, back in the 1620s, been discovered committing incest by their sister Margaret. Margaret confirmed catching her brother and sister in the act. Otherwise no independent witnesses were called, but there was evidence that the 1651 bestiality incident had been observed and reported by a witness at the time, but that no charges had been brought through lack of supporting evidence.<br>
<br>Thomas Weir was found guilty on all charges, and &#145;not being able to travell for age, was dragg'd on a sled&#146; on 11 April to the Gallowlee, between Edinburgh and Leith, where he was strangled at the stake and then burnt, dying in &#145;despair&#146;  (Scott-Moncrieff, 2.14). Jean was convicted of incest and sorcery, to which she had confessed, and was hanged in the Grassmarket on 12 April, trying to tear her clothes off so &#145;she might die with all the shame she could&#146;  (Scott-Moncrieff, 2.14).<br>
<br>The confessions of Thomas and Jean Weir may have exaggerated their misdeeds, but they may be accepted as basically truthful. Their confessions in old age may simply have been the expression of long suppressed guilt which became intolerable, but it seems possible that the Weirs had fallen into the antinomian heresy, and believed that, as the elect of God predestined for salvation, they could do no wrong&#151;but then lost conviction in their own election and collapsed into wild despair.<br>
<br>The story of Major Weir's crimes was exploited for propaganda purposes as sensational evidence that the supposedly godly presbyterian dissidents in Scotland were immoral hypocrites. In time the propaganda value of his case vanished, but his name survived in popular tales of outstanding wickedness, their crimes being usually bowdlerized as unsuitable subject matter for oral or literary treatment. Weir was transformed into a sorcerer, though he had never been charged with any offences relating to the supernatural, the surviving tales drawing on his sister Jean's confessions rather than his own. Her confessions to witchcraft, including dealings with &#145;the Queen of the Fairie, meaning the Devil&#146;  (Scott-Moncrieff, 2.11), alleged that Thomas too had had dealings with the devil, owning a magical staff that gave him power. As a result, even contemporary reports attributed &#145;horrible witchcraft&#146; as well as sexual offences to &#145;that monster of men and reproach of mankind&#146;  (J. Lauder, <span class="italic">Journals</span>, 1900, 232).<br>
<br>A number of literary figures took an interest in the Weir legend in this form, including Sir Walter Scott, who refers to Weir in <span class="italic">Redgauntlet</span> (1824). His friend Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, however, made it clear in correspondence with Scott that those who exploited stories of Weir as a warlock were well aware of his real crimes: Sharpe refers to Byron's <span class="italic">Manfred</span>, with its themes of the supernatural and incest combined, and suggests that, as with Weir so with Byron, incest would lead on to bestiality. Lady Scott, however, was evidently spared such knowledge of Weir's sexual offences, for she called her husband's walking stick &#145;Major Weir&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 270), oblivious to the phallic resonances of the staff which had given Weir his power.<br>
