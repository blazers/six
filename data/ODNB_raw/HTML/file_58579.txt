<span class="headword">Watson,  Rosamund  Marriott</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rosamund Ball; <em>pseuds. </em>Graham R. Tomson, R. Armytage]</span>  (1860&#150;1911), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, was born on 6 October 1860 at Homerton Row, Homerton, Hackney, London, youngest of the five children of Benjamin Williams Ball (1818&#150;1883), bank clerk and bibliophile, and his wife, Sylvia Good (1818&#150;1874). Educated at home, and prevented by family opposition from attending art school  (Marriott Watson to Chesson, 2 March 1905), she produced six volumes of poems, including <span class="italic">The Bird-Bride: a Volume of Ballads and Sonnets</span> (1889), <span class="italic">A Summer Night, and other Poems</span> (1891), <span class="italic">Vespertilia, and other Verses</span> (1895), and a volume of posthumous collected poems (1912). She was the author of books on interior decoration (1897) and gardening (1906), edited border ballads (1888) and <span class="italic">Selections from the Greek Anthology</span> (1889), headed a woman's magazine (<span class="italic">Sylvia's Journal</span>, 1893&#150;4), and contributed articles on fashion, art, interiors, gardens, and literature (as well as signed poems) to prominent journals such as the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, W. E. Henley's <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. Her contemporaries praised her for impeccable poetic technique and refined diction; equally notable are her female perspective on aestheticism and her anticipation of twentieth-century themes such as troubled (or serial) marriage and divorce.<br>
<br>On 9 September 1879 Rosamund married George Francis Armytage (1853&#150;1921), an affluent colonial from Australia who attended Jesus College, Cambridge; their daughters Eulalie and Daphne were born in 1882 and 1884. In 1884 she also published anonymously her first volume of poems, <span class="italic">Tares</span>. At this time marital discord surfaced, allegedly because of Rosamund's flirtations with other men  (<span class="italic">News of the World</span>, 1)&#151;a charge not unrelated to her remarkable beauty. &#145;Tall, willowy&#146;, with expressive brown eyes crowned by masses of black hair  (Pennell, 157&#150;8), she captivated others through her physical grace, beautiful attire, and exceptional intelligence and wit. Several contemporaries testified to the effect, from Elizabeth Pennell to Richard Le Gallienne, Oscar Wilde&#151;who inscribed a portrait, &#145;For a Poet and a Poem&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oscar Wilde</span>, 2.302)&#151;and Thomas Hardy. Years after her death Hardy wrote &#145;An Old Likeness (Recalling R. T.)&#146;, and Mrs Pine-Avon in <span class="italic">The Well-Beloved</span> may be a partial portrait  (Millgate, &#145;Thomas Hardy and Rosamund Tomson&#146;, 254&#150;5).<br>
<br>Following her separation from Armytage (and adoption of the publishing name &#145;R. Armytage&#146;) Rosamund eloped in 1886 with the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36534/', "Arthur Graham Tomson (1859&#150;1905)")</script>, a member of the New English Art Club. Her divorce from Armytage was finalized on 9 August 1887, and he took custody of their daughters; Arthur Tomson and Rosamund married on 21 September 1887, a month before their son Graham was born. As &#145;Graham R. Tomson&#146; she was &#145;discovered&#146; by Andrew Lang; became friends with William Sharp, Austin Dobson, and Alice Meynell, and entertained other notables such as G. B. Shaw; and quickly rose in prominence as one of the era's finest women poets. In 1892 she was elected president of the &#145;Literary Ladies&#146;, a group formed in 1889 to promote women writers.<br>
<br>As the <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span> contributor and &#145;patroness&#146; to J. M. Barrie's Allahakbarries  (Pennell, 214), Rosamund met Australian-born Henry Brereton (H. B.) Marriott Watson (1863&#150;1921), the atheist son of an Anglican clergyman, co-author with Barrie of <span class="italic">Richard Savage</span> (1889), and a handsome member of Henley's &#145;regatta&#146;. By 1894 they were lovers, leading Tomson to divorce her on 17 February 1896. Although she adopted H. B.'s two surnames, they never married, but expressed devotion to each other and to their son Richard, born in 1895 on his mother's birthday. Rosamund's decision to change her publishing name a third time compromised her visibility as well as reputation, and she gradually lapsed into obscurity despite William Archer's inclusion of her among genuine (if minor) poets in 1902. In 1903 she suffered a nervous breakdown  (Marriott Watson to Paine, 31 March 1903) and moved with H. B. and their son to Shere, Surrey; she died of uterine cancer on 29 December 1911 at Vachery, her home in Shere. She was buried on 2 January 1912 in the churchyard of St James's in Shere; the grave marker of Eulalie Armytage Brown-Hovelt, four years old when her mother eloped with Tomson, was later placed upon that of her mother.<br>
