<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  William Alexander</span>  (1854&#150;1914), <span class="occ">founder of the Boys' Brigade and businessman</span>, was born on 27 October 1854 at Pennyland House, near Thurso, Caithness, the eldest in the family of three sons and a daughter of David Smith of Pennyland, a director of the Labuan Coal Company in China, and his wife, Harriet, daughter of Alexander Fraser, merchant, of Glasgow. He was educated at the local parish school, the Miller Institution, later Thurso Academy, but little is known of his academic record. In 1868, when he was thirteen, his father died in China; the widowed Harriet Smith sold the Pennyland property and moved with her family into Thurso, accepting the offer of her brother, Alexander Fraser, to take William into his home and warehouse business in Glasgow. He soon settled into the routine of prosperous, middle-class, protestant business life, attending YMCA lectures, revival meetings led by the Americans Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey, sailing trips, and soir&eacute;es.<br>
<br>A growing estrangement led to Smith's departure from his uncle's home and business in 1878 to establish the exporting firm of Smith, Smith &amp; Co. with his younger brother Donald. A major factor in his Free Church uncle's disapproval of his nephew's way of life was Smith's enrolment in the 1st Lanarkshire rifle volunteers (he reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel before retiring in 1908), which ran counter to Fraser's pacifist views. In 1881 James G. Findlay, a friend and colleague, entered into partnership with Smith to form the firm Smith, Findlay &amp; Co., dealing in a variety of shawls, plaids, and tartans for export.<br>
<br>Smith was also a Sunday school teacher and, hard pressed, he started the first company of the Boys' Brigade (BB) on 4 October 1883 at the North Woodside mission hall of the wealthy College Free Church in the west end of Glasgow. He used military discipline and drill, acquired in the rifle volunteers, and a simple uniform of haversack, belt, and cap, to instil Christian manliness into unruly boys. The BB, a church-based, interdenominational youth movement, was started twenty-five years before the Boy Scouts first appeared on the scene.<br>
<br>In 1888 Smith, a conscientious and outwardly austere man, gave up his business to become the first full-time secretary of the BB, his salary being donated by prominent Scottish businessmen. The success of the BB, as the world's first voluntary uniformed youth organization, owed much to his tireless stewardship during its first thirty-one years. He toured Canada in 1895 to oversee BB progress at the invitation of his friend and supporter John Gordon, seventh earl of Aberdeen, the governor-general.<br>
<br>On 5 March 1884 Smith married Amelia Pearson (1858/9&#150;1898), daughter of the Revd Andrew Sutherland, a former Presbyterian chaplain to the British army in Gibraltar. They had two sons, both later prominent in the BB. Amelia died in 1898 and eight years later, on 10 April 1906, he married Hannah Ranken (1855/6&#150;1907), daughter of William Campbell, wholesale and retail merchant of Glasgow, a cousin of the British prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Smith inspected the United Boys' Brigades of America with her in 1907 but she died in the same year from the effects of an accident, not long after their return. Two years later, in July 1909, Smith absented himself for the shortest possible time during the annual 1st Glasgow company camp at Tighnabruaich to receive his knighthood in London. On 8 May 1914 he attended a meeting of the BB executive in London but was taken ill and admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he died on 10 May 1914.<br>
