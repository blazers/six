<span class="headword">Western,  Charles Callis</span>, Baron Western  (<em>bap. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> 1844), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the elder son of Charles Western of Rivenhall, Essex, and Frances Shirley, daughter and heir of Frances and William Bollan of Rivenhall (he was agent for the council of Massachusetts), and grandson of Thomas Western (<i>d</i>. 1765) and his wife, Anne Callis. He was baptized at Rivenhall on 9 August 1767. His great-grandfather Thomas Western (<i>d</i>. 1733) of Rivenhall married Mary, daughter and coheir of Sir Richard Shirley of Preston, Sussex, a near relative of the three famous brothers of Elizabethan fame, Sir Anthony Shirley, Robert Shirley, and Sir Thomas Shirley.<br>
<br>Western was educated at Newcome's school, Hackney, at Eton College, and at Queens' College, Cambridge, but apparently left the university without graduating. From his youth he was a close friend of Thomas Creevey. His father died when he was four years old, and upon attaining his majority he succeeded to the Rivenhall estates, purchasing, two years later, that of Felix Hall, Kelvedon. To this mansion, where he lived, he added a fine classical portico, constructed from a scale drawing of the Roman temple of Fortuna Virilis, given in Desgodetz's <span class="italic">&Eacute;difices antiques de Rome</span> (1682). He filled the house with valuable busts, urns, sarcophagi, and other objects collected during his travels abroad. They are given in a <span class="italic">Descriptive sketch of ancient statues, busts, &amp;c. at Felix Hall &hellip; with plates of the most striking objects in the collection</span> (1833).<br>
<br>Western was elected on 16 June 1790 as MP for Maldon, which borough he represented until 1812, with a break in 1806&#150;7. In these years he was seen as a moderate Foxite. In 1812, he stood successfully for Essex &#145;upon the old Whig interest&#146;, distancing himself from the more radical Burgoyne and receiving some tory support. He represented Essex until 1832. During his forty-two years in parliament he became the mouthpiece of the agricultural interests in the Commons, and boldly attacked, although without any immediate result, the currency question, with which the welfare of agriculture was, he considered, indissolubly bound, for he believed the sinking fund kept stocks artificially high. If not the author, he was one of the leading promoters of the <span class="roman">Corn Bill</span> of 1815, and advocated even more protection than it provided. He supported out-and-out protection, being as strongly opposed to the fixed duty of the whigs as to the free-trade doctrines of the Anti-Corn Law League. He became known, inevitably, as &#145;Squire&#146; Western.<br>
<br>Western was also interested in penal policy. He toured gaols and published <span class="italic">Remarks upon Prison Discipline</span> (1821) and <span class="italic">Thoughts on Prison Discipline</span> (1822), which included a design by William Cubitt, the inventor of the treadmill, for a model house of correction to contain 400 prisoners. The earlier tract was highly praised in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (36, 1821&#150;2, 353), and both were answered by George Holford in a <span class="italic">Vindication of the General Penitentiary at Milbank</span> (1822).<br>
<br>Despite his pronounced protectionism, Western remained whiggish on Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform, differing from many Essex men on both. At the first election after the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> he was defeated by thirty-two votes. Melbourne at once created him Baron Western of Rivenhall, Essex. On 21 March 1834 a presentation was made to him at Chelmsford by the county, where he was personally extremely popular. But although he had made his mark in the lower house as a speaker of great ability, he seldom took part in the debates of the Lords, and thenceforth lived in comparative retirement, devoted to practical improvements in farming, and experiments which he invited all agriculturists to examine. He gave his attention particularly to creating improved breeds of sheep; his name was long known and honoured in the colonies for his skilful efforts to &#145;place Merino wool upon a Leicester carcass&#146;.<br>
<br>Western died at Felix Hall on 4 November 1844, and was buried on the 13th in Rivenhall church with his ancestors. He was unmarried, and the peerage became extinct. The estates devolved upon Western's cousin, Thomas Burch Western, of Tattingstone Park, Suffolk, who was created a baronet on 20 August 1864 and died in 1917.<br>
