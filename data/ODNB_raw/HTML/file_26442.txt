<span class="headword">Stevenson,  Seth William</span>  (1784&#150;1853), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Norwich. His father, <a name="cosubject_26442"></a><span class="headword">William Stevenson</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1821), <span class="occ">publisher and author</span>, was the eldest son of the Revd Seth Ellis Stevenson (<i>d</i>. 1796), of East Retford, rector of Treswell, Nottinghamshire. William Stevenson went to Norwich as a miniature painter, having been a pupil of Reynolds, but from 1785 became proprietor of the <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, which he printed and published in partnership with John Crouse in Norwich market place. Stevenson was sheriff of the city in 1799. In 1812 he produced a new edition of James Bentham's <span class="italic">History of the Cathedral Church of Ely</span> (1771), adding a substantial supplement in 1817. He also edited John Campbell's <span class="italic">Lives of the British Admirals</span>, to 1812. He contributed frequently to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>, and helped Elizabeth Bentley (1767&#150;1839), the self-taught Norwich poet, to publish her first work. Elected FSA in 1801, he died after a long illness at Surrey House, Norwich, on 13 May 1821 and was buried at St Stephen's, Norwich, on 21 May.<br>
<br>William Stevenson's wife was Catherine (<i>bap</i>. 1751), eldest daughter of William Chase of the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> and widow of John Matchett. Their only son, Seth William Stevenson, was born in 1784, but only baptized, with a younger sister, on 30 October 1795 at St Peter Mancroft, where all Stevenson family baptisms and marriages were held. He became the third partner of Stevenson, Matchett, and Stevenson, succeeding his father as proprietor and virtual editor of the conservative <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> on the latter's death. He continued in this position until his own death, when his youngest son, Henry, took it on until 1888. For over a century, therefore, the paper was in the successive hands of three generations of a family linked with the principal printing and publishing families of the city. Seth William was elected FSA in 1817, the year he published his <span class="italic">Journal of a tour through part of France, Flanders and Holland, including a visit to Paris and a walk over the field of Waterloo in the summer of 1816</span>. This work, for private circulation, he dedicated to the Society of United Friars, a distinguished Norwich fraternity founded in 1785 by his father and Sir William Beechey for literary and philanthropic purposes. Seth William was initiated in 1813, becoming prior in 1815 and abbot in 1818; he was the most senior member when the society closed in 1828.<br>
<br>In 1827 Stevenson published his two-volume <span class="italic">Tour in France, Savoy, Northern Italy, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands</span>. The next year he was nominated sheriff of the city and elected alderman, serving as mayor in 1832. On 20 October 1817 he married Mary (<i>bap</i>. 5 March 1797), daughter of Francis Newton, silversmith, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashby). Together the Stevensons had two sons and two daughters, one of whom died in infancy. Henry, the younger son already mentioned, a fellow of the Linnean Society, was a founder of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society and the author of <span class="italic">The Birds of Norfolk</span> (3 vols., 1866&#150;90).<br>
<br>On its foundation in 1836 Seth William joined the Numismatic Society, and the British Archaeological Association in 1845. His chief leisure pursuit for many years was the compilation of a complete dictionary of Roman coins, explaining the different types of consular and imperial coins, and the symbols and devices depicted thereon. He included biographies of the emperors, and notes on the history, geography, and mythology associated with the rarest specimens. At his death about half the work was in print, but the remainder was revised by Charles Roach Smith and completed by F. W. Madden, illustrated by F. W. Fairholt, and published in 1889 as <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Roman Coins, Republican and Imperial</span>. It was sufficiently useful to merit a reprint in 1964. After six months of illness, Stevenson died on 22 December 1853 at 2 Pembroke Place, Cambridge, where lived his daughter Adelaide, the wife of John Deighton, a surgeon. Stevenson was buried at St Stephen's, Norwich, on 3 January 1854, where there is an armorial tablet dedicated to him, his father, and his wife, Mary, who had been buried there on 17 August 1848.<br>
