<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  (John) Derek  Alun-</span>  (1933&#150;2008), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born John Derek Jones on 6 June 1933 at 88 Loraine Mansions, Widdenham Road, Islington, London, the only son of Thomas Alun Jones, later Thomas Alun-Jones (<i>d</i>. 1951), solicitor and managing clerk, and his wife, Madge Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1986). He was educated at Lancing College, Sussex, and St Edmund Hall, Oxford. In 1955 he graduated with a third-class degree in jurisprudence, and in 1958 he passed his bar examinations. It was in the business world, however, that he decided to apply his skills, joining Philips Electrical in 1957 and then H. C. Stephens Ltd in 1959 as company secretary, thus initiating a career lasting sixteen years in the oil-related sector. On 16 July 1960 he married Gillian Palmer (<i>b</i>. 1937), a receptionist, and daughter of Ian Hamilton Palmer, businessman. They had a son, Jeremy (<i>b</i>. 1961), and a daughter, Casella (<i>b</i>. 1963), followed by triplets, Nicholas, Sophie, and Emma (<i>b</i>. 1968).<br>
<br>In 1960 Alun-Jones moved to Expandite Ltd, where he was appointed managing director when Expandite was acquired by Castrol in 1966. In turn, Castrol was acquired by Burmah Oil, providing him with an opportunity to join Burmah Industrial Products as managing director from 1971 to 1974. In the latter year he secured a seat on the main board of Burmah Oil, just at the point when it was experiencing severe financial difficulties, largely caused by the tanker division's inability to cope with the spillover from the 1973 oil price crisis. He was consequently deeply involved in handling not only the consequences of multiple mergers, but also the challenges associated with monitoring performance across divisionalized business organizations. It was experience that would stand him in good stead in the next phase of his business career.<br>
<br>At the same time that Burmah Oil, like many other British firms, was struggling in the economically difficult mid-1970s, Ferranti Ltd was experiencing a severe liquidity crisis. Although this family-owned electronics firm had become a major player in various defence markets, especially avionics and naval computer systems, the chairman and managing director, Sebastian de Ferranti, had refused to stem the losses made in the power transformers division, creating acute financial problems in 1974. Given Ferranti's major role in various military aircraft and Royal Navy projects, as well as being a major employer in some depressed parts of Lancashire, the incumbent Labour government used its newly created National Enterprise Board (NEB) to bail out the ailing firm. In return for &pound;15 million, however, not only did the NEB take a 65 per cent stake in Ferranti Ltd, but Sebastian de Ferranti was obliged to stand down as chief executive (though he was able to retain his position as chairman).<br>
<br>On taking over as managing director of Ferranti in 1975, Alun-Jones immediately set about reorganizing the firm's financial and decision-making structures, bringing his previous experience to bear in making Ferranti Ltd much more profitable. Even though the working relationship with Sebastian de Ferranti proved difficult, eventually resulting in the former owner's resignation in 1982, to be replaced as non-executive chairman by his brother, Basil de Ferranti, by 1978 Ferranti had been refloated on the London stock exchange. When in 1980 the NEB sold its holding in Ferranti to a large number of financial institutions, the latter's willingness to buy shares in the company reflected the trust they placed in the management skills of Alun-Jones and the team he had by then assembled.<br>
<br>Having secured its independence of government, Alun-Jones successfully sustained his aim of building Ferranti into a highly profitable defence contractor, using the slogan &#145;Creating wealth from technology&#146; to depict his core strategy. Ferranti shareholders certainly benefited from their investment, with dividend payments and share values increasing significantly up to 1987. This precipitated strong rumours that Ferranti would be targeted by a predator, given its profitability and strong product range. Alun-Jones's reputation was also significantly enhanced, leading to board appointments at Royal Insurance (1981&#150;96), Throgmorton Trust (1978&#150;84), Reed International (1984&#150;90), Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds (1986&#150;8), and Consolidated Gold Fields (1988&#150;9). He was also chairman of governors (1986&#150;99) at his old school, Lancing College, and a fellow of its owners, the Woodard Corporation (1986&#150;2003). In 1987 he was knighted for services to British business.<br>
<br>An essential component in Alun-Jones's strategy for Ferranti was creating a stronger presence in the world's largest defence market, the USA, resulting in a host of acquisitions of American firms between 1978 and 1987. The largest of these purchases, however, International Signal and Control Inc. (ISC), of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, proved to be calamitous. This merger, in 1987, resulted in Alun-Jones's appointment as executive chairman, Basil de Ferranti having been elevated to company president, while ISC's majority owner, James Guerin, became deputy chairman. Unbeknown to not only the Ferranti board, but also a small army of advisers and auditors, Guerin had built hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of phoney missile contracts into the accounts. It also transpired that he had been supplying armaments to South Africa and other countries on the United Nations embargo list, acting as the CIA's agent in regions that were regarded as strategically important. When these phoney contracts and illegal transactions eventually came to light in September 1989, Ferranti shares were immediately suspended and Alun-Jones was obliged to request a massive bailout from a syndicate of twenty banks. Although he had led Ferranti into the ISC merger for all the right reasons&#151;to build a stronger presence in the USA, as well as forestalling a predatorial bid&#151;it destroyed his reputation. He was obliged to resign as chairman of Ferranti in 1990. There was considerable controversy over the &pound;491,000 package he received on leaving Ferranti, but not only did he have two years of his contract to run, he successfully negotiated the bank rescue package and the sale of the avionics business to the General Electric Company for &pound;300 million, keeping the firm afloat. Guerin was subsequently sentenced to a fifteen-year prison term in the USA, for fraud and money-laundering.<br>
<br>Alun-Jones effectively retired in 1990, having given up all his other directorships to concentrate on helping to look after an increasing number of grandchildren, play golf, and fish. (In 1993 there was again controversy when it emerged that he had bought Ferranti's fishing rights on the River Test at a knock-down price.) He lived for much of his married life at The Willows, Effingham Common, Leatherhead, Surrey. He died on 19 January 2008, of bronchopneumonia, at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford. He was buried in Effingham, and a memorial service was held at Chelsea Old Church, London, on 24 April 2008. He was survived by his wife, Gillian, and their five children.<br>
