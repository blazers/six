<span class="headword">Welles <span class="st"> [Welle]</span>,  Adam  de</span>, first Lord Welles  (<em>d.</em> 1311), <span class="occ">baron and soldier</span>, was the son of a Lincolnshire landowner, William de Welle (<i>d</i>. 1264), and his wife, Isabel Periton (<i>d</i>. 1315). The family derived its name from Well, near Alford in Lincolnshire. Adam succeeded his elder brother, William, in or after 1286. He went abroad with Hugh Despenser on a royal embassy to Germany in 1294. The date of his entry into the royal household is not known, but he was listed as a banneret of the king's household from 1297 to 1306. In 1297 he was among those appointed to receive fines from those clergy who wished to re-enter the king's protection during Edward I's dispute with Archbishop Winchelsey. It seems certain that he continued to support the king during the developing political crisis in that year; he participated in the fruitless royal expedition in Flanders in the autumn with a retinue of one knight and twelve squires. Two of the latter were knighted in the course of the campaign. Welles fought with Edward at the battle of Falkirk in 1298. In 1299 he was given custody of Rockingham Castle and was made keeper of the royal forests between Oxford and Stamford, a clear sign of royal favour. In the same year he was summoned to parliament as a baron. In 1300 he was present on the Caerlaverock campaign in Scotland, serving with a contingent of three knights and nine squires. He served in Scotland again in 1301 and in 1303&#150;4. His involvement in the Scottish wars continued under Edward II, with service in the campaign of 1309&#150;10. He was also summoned regularly to parliament.<br>
<br>Adam de Welles died on 1 September 1311, and was buried in Greenfield Priory, Lincolnshire. He was survived by his wife Joan (<i>d</i>. 1315), daughter of Sir John Engaine and widow of Walter Fitzrobert, whom he had married by 1296. Virtually all his estates were in Lincolnshire. In 1297 he acquired lands in that county from William (II) of Wyleby, and he later bought the manor of Wyberton from John Holland. Edward II granted him lands there worth &pound;42. The inquisition taken on his death showed that he held the whole or parts of seventeen manors, and five advowsons. He left two sons, Robert and Adam.<br>
