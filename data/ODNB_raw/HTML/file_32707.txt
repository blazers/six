<span class="headword">Daniel,  Evan</span>  (1837&#150;1904), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman, educationist, and author</span>, born at Pontypool on 4 September 1837, was the second son of Evan Daniel of Pontypool, builder and architect, and his wife, Sarah Beach. After education at the national school, Pontypool, he entered St John's Training College, Battersea, in 1856. He became lecturer in English literature at the college in 1859 and vice-principal in 1863. In the same year he was ordained deacon, and priest in 1864. He was appointed principal in 1866, a post which he held for twenty-eight years. On becoming principal he began reading for a degree at Trinity College, Dublin; both in 1868 and 1870 he won there the vice-chancellor's prize for English verse, and in 1869 the prize for English prose. He graduated BA in 1870 as senior moderator and gold medallist in English literature, history, and political science, and proceeded MA in 1874.<br>
<br>Daniel was well regarded as an educationist, and published several books on the subject, including <span class="italic">How to Teach the Church Catechism</span> (1882) and <span class="italic">Elementary Algebra</span> (2 vols., 1883&#150;5). He edited John Locke's <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on Education</span> (1880), and made the complex history of the prayer book comprehensible in his popular <span class="italic">The Prayer-Book</span> (1877), which went through at least twenty editions. From 1873 to 1879 he served on the second London school board, and in 1881 he was appointed practical lecturer on education at Cambridge. In 1879 Anthony Wilson Thorold, bishop of Rochester, made him an honorary canon of his cathedral, and from 1892 he was proctor in convocation for the dean and chapter of Rochester. On his resignation of the principalship of St John's Training College in 1894, Archbishop E. W. Benson nominated him to the vicarage of Horsham, and in 1902 he became rural dean of Storrington. Daniel, who held broad-church views, was known as a powerful preacher. He married in 1863 Elizabeth Mosell of Pontypool, who died in 1901. They had six daughters and three sons. Daniel died at Horsham vicarage on 27 May 1904, and was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
<br>A portrait of Daniel, painted after his death by P. Keelan, was hung in the hall of St John's Training College, Battersea, where he was also commemorated by the establishment of the Daniel Library. A stained-glass window to his memory was installed in Horsham parish church.<br>
