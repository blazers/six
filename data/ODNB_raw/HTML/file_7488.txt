<span class="headword">Denison,  George Anthony</span>  (1805&#150;1896), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, born at Ossington, Nottinghamshire, on 11 December 1805, was the fourth son of John Denison (1758?&#150;1820), merchant, of Leeds, MP for Colchester (1802&#150;6) and for Minehead (1807&#150;12), and his second wife, Charlotte Estwick. His siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7486/', "Edward Denison (1801&#150;1854)")</script>, bishop of Salisbury, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7490/', "(John) Evelyn Denison, Viscount Ossington (1800&#150;1873)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7492/', "Sir William Thomas Denison (1804&#150;1871)")</script>, colonial governor. Denison was educated at private schools, at Eton College from 1817 to 1823, and at Oxford, for which he was prepared by a private tutor, Charles Drury, whose severe discipline he described as the most salutary experience of his life. He matriculated from Christ Church on 14 November 1823, graduated BA (with a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>) in 1827, and proceeded MA in 1830. He twice gained the chancellor's prize&#151;by his Latin essay in 1828, in which year he was elected fellow of Oriel College, and by his English essay in 1829.<br>
<br>In 1832 Denison took holy orders and served as curate of Cuddesdon. In 1830 he was elected to a college tutorship at Oriel, which he retained until 1836, when he exchanged it for the office of treasurer. He found Oriel society extremely uncongenial, and in 1838 accepted from his brother Edward, bishop of Salisbury, the vicarage of Broadwinsor, Dorset. On 4 September of that year he married Georgiana (1819&#150;1908), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12929/', "Joseph Warner Henley")</script>. He was collated on 10 August 1841 to the prebend of Wilsford and Woodford in the church of Sarum, and on 28 April 1849 to the ninth prebend of Combe in the church of Wells. This he exchanged for the two prebends of Milverton in the same church on his appointment in September 1851 to the archdeaconry of Taunton. In 1845 he had been appointed vicar of East Brent in Somerset.<br>
<br>From the first a strong high-churchman, and subsequently very sympathetic to the teachings and practices of the Tractarians, Denison united with Henry Edward Manning in organizing resistance to the regulation of parochial schools by the state, on which subject he wrote extensively from 1847, becoming a champion of the National Society. He also joined in the protests against the preferment of the broad-churchman R. D. Hampden to the see of Hereford in 1847 and against the final judgment of 1850 in the Gorham case. He was himself defendant in another ecclesiastical <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. The high-church doctrine of the eucharist which, as examining chaplain to the bishop of Bath and Wells, he set before the candidates for ordination led to a disagreement with the bishop's commissary, in which Denison was so poorly supported by the bishop, Richard Bagot, that he resigned (June 1853). He then defined his doctrinal position with precision in three sermons preached in Wells Cathedral (7 August 1853, 6 November 1853, and 14 May 1854). In these sermons Denison affirmed a real (though non-material) presence of Christ in the elements by virtue of consecration and prior to their reception. All communicants thus received the inward grace of the sacrament (though not necessarily its spiritual benefit) together with the outward sign. Such a view seemed to contradict article twenty-nine of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and, moreover, to encourage devotion to the sacramental species. The terminology which he employed reflected that of other Tractarians, especially R. I. Wilberforce in his <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist</span> of 1853. Denison's position was also explicitly supported by John Keble in the latter's <span class="italic">On Eucharistical Adoration</span> (1857) when the Evangelical Alliance, on the basis of Denison's sermons, instituted proceedings in the ecclesiastical courts. The prosecution, initiated ostensibly by the Revd Joseph Ditcher, vicar of South Brent, was pursued with vigour, and met with firm resistance from Denison. The result, as in the Gorham case, served only to illustrate the uncertainty of the law. Denison's views were declared contrary to the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth of the articles of religion by Archbishop J. B. Sumner, sitting with assessors at Bath on 12 August 1856, and as Denison declined to recant he was sentenced to deprivation on 22 October. However, the execution of the sentence was deferred, pending an appeal to the court of arches, which resulted in its reversal on a technical point on 23 April 1857. An appeal from this decision was dismissed by the judicial committee of the privy council on 6 February 1858 without any decision on the substantive question, but to the relief of most Tractarians.<br>
<br>Denison was editor of the <span class="italic">Church and State Review</span>, published from 1862 until 1865. For many years he was a potent conservative voice in the convocation of Canterbury, which he succeeded in committing in 1863 to a censure (20 May) of J. W. Colenso's <span class="italic">Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua Critically Examined</span>, and in the following year to a more formal condemnation (24 June) of the controversial <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> (1861). He also led opposition to the endowment of the regius chair of Greek at Oxford, apparently for no other reason than that it was held by the heterodox Benjamin Jowett (1817&#150;1893), and in December 1869 entered his protest against Frederick Temple's consecration to the see of Exeter. He was also a consistent opponent of any change in the law of divorce. Denison remained staunchly opposed to any form of state intervention in Church of England schools and viewed the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> with disgust. His attempt to foreclose the discussion on the Athanasian creed, in the course of Dean Stanley's speech in the lower house of the convocation of Canterbury, on 24 April 1872, caused a dramatic scene which terminated in his temporary secession from the assembly.<br>
<br>The one issue upon which Denison himself admitted to a change of opinion was that of ritualism. His eucharistic beliefs gradually led to his support for more ceremonial, a fact signalled by his joining the Society of the Holy Cross in 1877. He remained entirely unreceptive to development of biblical criticism, and his disapproval of <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span> (1889), a series of essays by more liberally inclined younger Anglo-Catholics, caused his secession in 1892 from the English Church Union, of which he had been one of the founders. He was resolutely opposed to the policies of the Gladstonian Liberal Party in the 1880s and 1890s, and his vehement denunciations in print of Gladstone's character and opinions attracted much public attention. Embittered by the progress of the social, political, and religious change which he had vainly but vigorously opposed, he spent his last years in comparative seclusion at East Brent, where he died on 21 March 1896. He was buried in East Brent churchyard on 26 March.<br>
<br>Although an unsparing opponent in public controversies, Denison's private character was an appealing one. He reserved his <i>odium theologicum</i> exclusively for public use: despite the depth of his public differences he always maintained harmonious private relations with Dean Stanley. As a parish priest he shared in the Tractarian desire to restore the neglected aspects of worship, and had a keen eye to the temporal as well as the spiritual needs of his parishioners. With him the popular harvest festival is said to have originated, and he improved the water supply at East Brent at his own expense.<br>
