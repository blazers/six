<span class="headword">Warren, Sir  Peter</span>  (1703/4&#150;1752), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the youngest son of Michael Warren of Warrenstown, co. Meath, an officer in the army of James II, and Catherine, only daughter of Sir Christopher Aylmer, baronet, brother of Admiral Matthew Aylmer. Born into a Roman Catholic family, Warren was brought up a protestant so as to enter naval service. He followed his eldest brother, Oliver (<i>d</i>. 1724), into the navy, entering at Dublin as an ordinary seaman on the <i>Rye</i> (30 guns) in 1716, under Aylmer's patronage and that of his son-in-law, Admiral Sir John Norris. After serving in Irish waters Warren spent most of his early years either on the coast of west Africa or in the West Indies, hunting pirates and warding off <i>guarda-costas</i>. He was made lieutenant in the <i>Guernsey</i> off the Liberian coast in January 1723, when natives killed one of his brother officers. Placed in command of the <i>Falkland</i> (50 guns) upon the death of his captain in 1726, he earned freight money by carrying bullion owned by the South Sea Company. In 1728 he took post as captain of the <i>Grafton</i> (70 guns) under Norris, then commanding the Baltic fleet. Later that year, in command of the <i>Solebay</i> (20 guns), he carried to Jamaica and Vera Cruz news of the peace treaty and called at South Carolina on his route home, where he met George Anson. In July 1731 Warren married Susannah, daughter of Stephen DeLancey of New York and sister of James DeLancey, later the colony's lieutenant-governor. The couple had six children.<br>
<br>Between 1730 and 1732 Warren commanded the <i>Solebay</i> on the New York and South Carolina stations. In 1734&#150;5 he served in the <i>Leopard</i> (50 guns) as part of the western squadron commanded by Norris. In 1736&#150;41 he was captain of the <i>Squirrel</i> (20 guns) at Boston, and in 1739 he submitted a report on the state of the Nova Scotia fisheries. Upon the outbreak of war with Spain, Warren served at the 1740 failed siege of St Augustine, under the senior captain, Vincent Pierce. From Florida he sailed for Jamaica to serve under Vernon, who thought him an &#145;active good officer&#146; for his success in taking Spanish prizes. In January 1742 he was given command of the <i>Superbe</i> (60 guns) and was again appointed to the New York station. That August the Admiralty adopted Warren's suggestion that some of the ships stationed on the North American coast be formed into a squadron to serve in the West Indies during winter months. In this way he came to command the Leeward Islands squadron, which distinguished itself by taking prizes, especially in 1744 when war ensnared France.<br>
<br>Warren became well known as a result of the 1745 siege of Fortress Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. In 1741 he had first discussed the idea with William Pepperell, appointed the military commander. In 1743 he told the Admiralty that its capture and that of Canada would prove of great consequence to Britain. In April 1745 he took his squadron (the <i>Superbe</i> and three frigates) north to Canso, where he found a dozen colonial armed vessels escorting the colonial expeditionary force. He effected a close blockade of the Louisbourg harbour, and was rewarded when the <i>Vigilant</i> (64 guns) was taken, and immediately commissioned by the commodore. Naval reinforcements thereafter joined him, so that by mid-June he commanded six ships of the line and five frigates mounting 558 guns with 3585 officers, seamen, and marines. In the face of this naval force and on the eve of a planned frontal assault by the New Englanders, the fortress capitulated on generous terms.<br>
<br>News of this success caused a great sensation in London. In celebration there were bonfires, the Tower guns were fired, poems and broadsheets were published, loyal greetings drafted, and public houses renamed. Warren's behaviour was contrasted with the unfortunate naval officers implicated in the inglorious affair off Toulon in February 1744, when a Franco-Spanish squadron had escaped the navy. For the first time American affairs commanded widespread attention at home. Warren was promoted rear-admiral. He declined a baronetcy as he had no son. Named first English governor of Cape Breton, he immediately begged to be relieved, pleading ill health with Anson and Sandwich, and his desire to serve at sea with Bedford and Newcastle. His real thoughts were probably on half pay and the governorship of New York, for which he had been negotiating with the governor, Vice-Admiral George Clinton, and where he had acquired important family and financial connections.<br>
<br>Warren's enthusiasm for Cape Breton was at first almost boundless. In letters home he wrote of Louisbourg as a mere stepping stone to the conquest of Canada, and thus Britain's domination of both fur and fish, while he pressed for an expeditionary force to be mounted in 1746. The politicians were divided. Henry Pelham thought Louisbourg's capture an obstacle to peace. By contrast, lords Newcastle and Hardwicke basked in the reflected glory while John Carteret, William Pitt, and George II spoke warmly of the action.<br>
<br>Relieved of his governorship in June 1746, Warren spent the summer in Boston concerting plans with Governor William Shirley to secure colonial support for a planned expedition to Canada. The plan, which was only formulated by the ministry in late March, called for a two-pronged attack: one centred on Albany via Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River to Montreal; the other based in Portsmouth involving 4000 regulars, an artillery train, and a large squadron under Warren's command to seize Quebec via the St Lawrence River. The campaign was a fiasco, as the force never left England, and the American troops accomplished nothing north of Saratoga. Without orders, Warren sailed home with a detailed plan for 1747 worked out with Governor Shirley. The Admiralty was now convinced that it had too few ships both to blockade the French in their home ports and also undertake the Canada expedition. At first Warren was given command of an eight-ship squadron planned to reinforce Louisbourg. Plans were altered when news arrived of a French armament, and Warren was named second-in-command to Anson to cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Off Cape Ortegal on May 1747 they caught the French force, under La Jonqui&egrave;re, and overwhelmed it. Anson was rewarded with a peerage and &pound;62,991 in prize money, Warren with the Order of the Bath and &pound;31,496. In July he was promoted vice-admiral. Yet France still retained formidable naval forces both in her Atlantic ports and in Toulon, while French trade to the Caribbean and Quebec was little hindered. Mastery of the western approaches was established only in October when Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke&#151;illness having kept Warren ashore&#151;crushed a French squadron off Cape Finisterre. Warren resumed command of this western squadron in 1748, but no French or Spanish fleet put to sea before peace preliminaries ended the war.<br>
<br>Warren never again went to sea. In 1747 he had been elected MP for the city of Westminster at the cost of &pound;2200 and, as he then owned no land in England, the purchase of an annuity for &pound;4800 on land from the duke of Bedford. In December 1748, despite Anson's support, he failed in a bid for a vacancy on the Admiralty board. He soon alienated his supporters by leading opposition to one clause of Anson's 1749 naval bill, by which half pay officers became subject to court martial on grounds identical to serving officers. Pamphlets were written and naval officers were summoned to meetings at which Warren and Norris presided. Warren and others addressed the Admiralty board, a most unusual circumstance. Warren's point carried the day, but it cost him his alliance with Bedford, Sandwich, and Anson. In parliament he was active in committees, chairing several and twice carrying bills to the Lords. He was one of the best informed members on American affairs, concerned especially with colonial trade, currency, boundary disputes, and the fisheries. Deeply suspicious of French ambitions, Warren advocated a strong navy and powerful European alliances. He also proposed in 1747 new designs for admirals' and captains' uniforms.<br>
<br>The war allowed him to garner &pound;127,405 in prize money, the bulk of it in 1745 and 1747. Only Anson perhaps accumulated more. His wealth was invested in land and money-lending in England, Ireland, and the American colonies; he also bought heavily into the national debt. Much of Greenwich Village on Manhattan Island was later erected on his farm, which was sold by his heirs after 1787. He installed his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14925/', "William Johnson")</script>, to superintend his Mohawk valley lands, launching the young man into a celebrated career on that frontier. His Hampshire estate in the Meon valley, conveniently close to Portsmouth, purchased in 1747, remained in the hands of his heirs until the 1860s. In 1747 he also purchased 15 Cavendish Square, in London. Of Warren's six children, two were born in Boston, two in New York, and two in London, to which he summoned his family in 1747. Two of his children, including his only son, died in a 1744 epidemic. His eldest daughter married Charles Fitzroy, later Baron Southampton, while his third daughter, Charlotte, married the earl of Abingdon. Warren died suddenly of a fever in Dublin on 29 July 1752 and was buried in Warrenstown, co. Meath. His widow commissioned Roubiliac to carve his monument, now in Westminster Abbey.<br>
