<span class="headword">Hollis,  Aiskew Paffard</span>  (1764&#150;1844), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, entered the navy in 1774, under the protection of Captain Parry, and in 1778 was present on the <i>Vigilant</i> in Keppel's action off Ushant. In January 1781 he was promoted lieutenant, and, continuing in active service during the peace, was appointed in July 1793 to the <i>Queen</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Gardner. In her he took part in the battle of 1 June 1794, where he was seriously wounded in the head by a splinter, and the encounter off Lorient on 23 July 1795. In November 1796 he was promoted to command the <i>Chichester</i> (44 guns), employed as a storeship. On 10 November 1797, at the Cape of Good Hope, he was ordered to take temporary command of the <i>Jupiter</i> and bring in the frigate <i>Crescent</i>, then in a state of mutiny at Robin Island. This delicate service was well performed, and the <i>Crescent</i> towed into Table Bay, under the batteries. Six days afterwards he was given an acting commission as captain of the flagship <i>Tremendous</i> (74 guns), from which he was shortly moved to the frigate <i>Vindictive</i> and sent home in charge of an East Indies convoy. On his arrival his commission was confirmed by the Admiralty.<br>
<br>In June 1801 Hollis was appointed to the frigate <i>Thames</i> (32 guns), and commanded her in the action in the Gut of Gibraltar on 12 July, and in the operations on the coast of Egypt. The <i>Thames</i> was paid off in January 1803, and in the following autumn Hollis was appointed to the <i>Mermaid</i>, in which he served in the West Indies under the flag of Sir John Duckworth. He returned to England in 1807, and in March 1809 joined the <i>Standard</i> (64 guns), forming one of the fleet up the Baltic under Sir James Saumarez, and in which he was detached in command of the squadron which in May occupied the Isle of Anholt. Early in 1811 the <i>Standard</i> went out to Lisbon in charge of a large convoy, and for a short time assisted in the defence of Cadiz. In April Hollis was moved into the <i>Achilles</i> (80 guns), attached to the fleet before Toulon, and later employed in the Adriatic, returning to England in the summer of 1813. After the peace Hollis commanded the <i>Rivoli</i> (74 guns) from 1816 to 1817, and the <i>Ramillies</i> from 1818 to 1821, as guardships at Portsmouth. He saw no further service, though he became in course of seniority rear-admiral in 1825 and vice-admiral in 1837. He died at his residence, Highfield, Southampton, on 23 June 1844.<br>
