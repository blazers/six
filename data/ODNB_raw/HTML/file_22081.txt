<span class="headword">Peyton, Sir  John</span>  (1579&#150;1635), <span class="occ">soldier, spy, and administrator</span>, was probably born at Beaupr&eacute; Hall in Outwell, Norfolk, in 1579, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22080/', "Sir John Peyton (1544&#150;1630)")</script>, soldier and administrator, of Doddington, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beaupr&eacute; (<i>d</i>.1603), widow of Sir Robert Bell. He was admitted as fellow commoner of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1594. At Queens' he was an exact contemporary of the poet and later traveller John Weever and there he may have met Nathanial Fletcher, elder brother of the future playwright John Fletcher. Peyton must have acquired excellent Latin, and his later writings certainly exhibit some knowledge of German and Italian.<br>
<br>In 1596 Peyton left on a confidential mission for Germany and Bohemia, reaching Poland in spring 1598. His task was to gather detailed information on Spanish activities in the Holy Roman empire and in the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth, and his mission appears to have been arranged and at least partly financed by Robert Cecil, who had recently been appointed secretary of state. From Poland, Peyton travelled to Padua, then to Basel, where he was in November 1599, before returning to Italy. Writing to his father from Basel, Peyton complained about his life as a spy: &#145;it being &hellip; dangerous for a man to bee noted of curious enquiry&#146;  (CUL, MS Kk.5.2., fols. 2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). He returned to England between 1601 and November 1602 at the latest.<br>
<br>Peyton's reports have survived in three separate manuscripts. The accounts of Germany and Bohemia&#151;together with some of his letters&#151;were begun in 1599 but completed in 1619 on the island of Jersey and are held in the Cambridge University Library (CUL, MS Kk.5.2). The contents are written by a variety of scribes; only Peyton's letters were copied into the codex by himself. His <span class="italic">A Relation of the State of Polonia and the United Provinces of That Crowne</span> is the most celebrated early description of Poland written in English. It was prepared in Cracow and Warsaw between April and September 1598 and was long thought to have been anonymous. The work survives in two manuscript copies: one at the British Library, London (BL, Royal MS 18 B I), and a second at the University of St Andrews (U. St Andr. L., MS 38902). The former is an unfinished presentation copy given by Peyton to James I and VI on his accession to the English throne in May 1603 and most likely prepared in London by one of his father's scribes; the latter is the only complete version of the work, produced under Peyton's supervision between 1619 and 1635 in Jersey. On 25 November 1602 Peyton married Alice Peyton, the second daughter of his cousin Sir John Peyton of Iselham, at Iselham, Cambridgeshire. They had three sons and six daughters: his heir, Robert, Algernon (heir to his brother Robert), Henry, Elizabeth, Alice, Dorothy, Frances, Susanna, and Anne.<br>
<br>In March 1603, when Queen Elizabeth lay on her deathbed, Peyton's father, a close associate of Robert Cecil and a member of the Jacobean camp, placed his son in daily attendance at court. When the queen died, Peyton raced to Edinburgh to break the news to James and assure the future king of his father's loyalty. Although he was not the first to reach James, Peyton was rewarded with a knighthood, which was bestowed on him either on 28 March or on 12 April 1603. He was afterwards known as the king's &#145;first Knight&#146;  (Chambers, 2.11).<br>
<br>Some time between the queen's death and James's arrival in London, Peyton presented the king with what is now the British Library manuscript of <span class="italic">A Relation of the State of Polonia</span>. On 18 August 1603 James granted to Peyton in fee simple Lingen manor in Gloucestershire and five other manors in Herefordshire. At the time his father was lieutenant of the Tower of London, and Peyton was alleged to have been friendly with Sir Walter Ralegh, one of the prisoners.<br>
<br>In 1612 and 1618 Peyton served in the Low Countries and, with the help of his friend and neighbour Sir Robert Cotton, he unsuccessfully attempted to secure the post of lieutenant-governor of Brill. From 1618 until 1630 Peyton served intermittently as lieutenant-governor of Jersey on behalf of his father, who had assumed the lieutenancy of Jersey on leaving his post at the Tower in July 1603. Throughout much of his life Peyton acted jointly with his well-connected father, both in running Jersey and maintaining the family estate in Cambridgeshire. In a letter to Cecil sent in 1605 Peyton hints at his past intelligence gathering: &#145;[h]aving divers times attended to present my service, as well of myself as by my father's directions&#146;  (Cecil MSS 112/112, 1605, 10 Oct or later). Peyton's hand appears in a number of letters sent by his father to Cecil.<br>
<br>Peyton's will is dated 24 February 1635 and was proved by his wife, the sole executor of the will, on 22 April of that year  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/167/4). The exact date of his death is unknown and he was buried in the chancel of the church of St Mary the Virgin, Doddington. In 1633 his daughter Alice (1607&#150;1649) married the composer Edward Lowe, professor of music at Oxford and long-time organist of Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
