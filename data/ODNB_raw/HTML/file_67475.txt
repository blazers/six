<span class="headword">Simon,  Ulrich Ernst</span>  (1913&#150;1997), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born in Berlin on 21 September 1913, the younger son of James Martin Simon (1880&#150;<i>c</i>.1944), concert pianist and composer, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levi (1885&#150;1969), a freelance broadcaster on literary matters. This cultured environment was to bear fruit in the breadth of his learning and culture. He met among others Thomas Mann and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, being a near contemporary of the latter at Grunewald Gymnasium, which he attended from about 1923 to 1931. (The school was later renamed the Walther Rathenau Schule, and Simon retained vivid memories both of the man and of the assassination which took place nearby in 1922.) After escaping from Germany in 1933&#151;his father was later to perish in Auschwitz, his brother, J&ouml;rn Martin (1910&#150;1937?), almost certainly under Stalin&#151;he moved to London and, after a brief employment in a small firm in the City, trained for the Anglican priesthood, first at King's College, London (1935&#150;8), and then at Lincoln Theological College (1938), having been baptized in July 1934. He was ordained deacon in 1938 and priest in 1939. In 1949 he married Joan Edith Raynor Westlake (<i>b</i>. 1920), daughter of Canon Herbert Francis Westlake (1879&#150;1925), custodian and historian of Westminster Abbey. His wife was herself a teacher of classics and divinity. They had three children: Sophia Anne (<i>b</i>. 1950), Martin Francis Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1952), and Peter Paul (<i>b</i>. 1954).<br>
<br>After serving in two curacies&#151;St Helier, Southwark (1938&#150;42), and Upton with Chalvey, Slough (1942&#150;5)&#151;Simon returned to King's College in 1945 and devoted to it his whole career until retirement in 1980. He taught both <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and Christian theology, and, beginning as lecturer in Hebrew and <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, achieved in 1959 both a DD of London University and a readership in theology. He became in 1971 professor of Christian literature, devoting his inaugural lecture to Mann's <span class="italic">Der Zauberberg</span> (&#145;The Magic Mountain&#146;). He was elected a fellow of King's College in 1957.<br>
<br>Simon's outlook matched his experience, and he commented pungently and often pessimistically on his times, being particularly caustic about sloppy thinking which ignored the signs of the times. Indeed, it was his unerring sense of evil which drove his impatience with what he saw as effete and blind liberalism&#151;he described John Robinson's best-selling <span class="italic">Honest to God</span> (1963) as a &#145;mean little book&#146;. His final years at King's were as dean of the college, in which post he succeeded Sydney Evans in 1978, adapting the office to the reduced circumstances forced on it by changes in the college's constitution. There he both revealed his priorities and strained the patience of his secretary by insisting on reading for a period&#151;a passage from Proust for instance&#151;before he faced the morning's correspondence.<br>
<br>Simon's intellectual achievement was various and reflected the range of his teaching responsibilities and the breadth of his interests. Noteworthy among his ten books was <span class="italic">A Theology of Auschwitz</span> (1967), which was unique among the vast literature generated by that evil. More than anything, it was a meditation on the suffering of Simon's own people in the light of the passion of Christ. Other books included <span class="italic">Theology of Crisis</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Heaven in the Christian Tradition</span> (1958), <span class="italic">A Theology of Salvation</span> (1961), a theological commentary on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 40&#150;55, <span class="italic">The Trial of Man</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Story and Faith</span> (1975). He was firmly of the opinion, if that is not too weak a word, that those who have no music in their soul should leave theology alone; indeed, what he took to be a slighting reference to Bach once induced anger. Mozart was another love, one shared with Karl Barth, the theologian who influenced him most, sustaining him during the war and giving him breathing space on a visit to Basel after it, and whose later neglect he deplored. And into all his thinking was fed his reading of literature&#151;Dante, Shakespeare, and Dostoyevsky perhaps most prominent, but also Goethe, Mann, Milton, and Kierkegaard.<br>
<br>In 1978 Simon published the characteristically titled <span class="italic">Sitting in Judgement, 1913&#150;63: an Interpretation of History</span>. A kind of autobiography, as the first date in the title implied, it was, like many of Simon's writings, idiosyncratic and unusual, far exceeding the expectations aroused by the genre. It both told the story of his first fifty years&#151;ending in time, though not in the organization of the narrative, with the assassination of Kennedy, which shocked him deeply&#151;and was the vehicle for characteristic judgements on his times. One chapter, &#145;This precious isle&#146;, took over from the allusion to Shakespeare's words both love for his adopted land and church and sharp observations on those whose apostasy threatened the nation's integrity and liberty. The chapters on the Second World War provided a unique perspective on British society and its leaders, cameos of figures as different as Bishop George Kennedy Allen Bell of Chichester and Victor Gollancz helping to illuminate the atmosphere of the times. One review described the book as &#145;dazzling in its virtuosity, devastating in its accusation, yet offering hope and not despair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Expository Times</span>, 1978, 288). Similarly, his public speaking was eloquent, pungent, and beautifully organized, often with the help of a few scribbled notes.<br>
<br>Simon's writing virtually ceased after his retirement, reflecting, it would seem, a measure of disillusionment with developments in the Church of England. His musical activities became his main interest; the day before his death (of an aneurism, at his home, 22 Collingwood Avenue, London) on 31 July 1997 he had bought a new set of strings for his violin, of which he was an accomplished player. His ashes were buried in Coton churchyard, Cambridgeshire, on 5 July 1999; he was survived by his wife.<br>
