<span class="headword">Andrews,  John Miller</span>  (1871&#150;1956), <span class="occ">prime minister of Northern Ireland</span>, was born on 17 July 1871 at Ardara, Comber, co. Down, the eldest child in the family of four sons and one daughter of Thomas Andrews DL, flax spinner, also of Ardara, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of James Alexander Pirrie, of Belfast, and sister of William James, Viscount Pirrie. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30417/', "Sir James Andrews")</script> became lord chief justice of Northern Ireland. He was educated at the Royal Academical Institution, Belfast. He married in 1902 Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1950), eldest daughter of Joseph Ormrod, stockbroker, of Bolton. They had one son and two daughters. His younger brother James married Jessie's sister.<br>
<br>Following his father in business and politics, Andrews developed interests in a large number of commercial enterprises, not least in flax spinning and the Belfast and Down Railway. A Liberal Unionist, he was at one time president of the Ulster Liberal Unionist Association and a member of the committee of the Ulster Reform Club. He threw himself wholeheartedly into Ulster Unionist opposition to home rule in the early twentieth century, and was an active member of the Ulster Unionist Council and first president of the Ulster Unionist Labour Association. As one of the architects of Northern Ireland, he sat in its parliament for County Down (1921&#150;9) and then for Mid-Down and County Down from 1930, and held high office for over twenty years, as successively minister of labour (1921&#150;37), minister of finance (1937&#150;40), and prime minister (1940&#150;43). He remained in parliament until 1953.<br>
<br>Although firm on the link with Britain and steadfastly opposed to a united Ireland, and although not immune to the pressures of extreme protestant organizations, Andrews was never a strident Unionist. Only in 1941 did he first hold significant office in the Orange order, and in 1949 he reached the highest rank on his election as imperial grand master of the grand Orange council of the world. His ministerial career was characterized by tolerance, humanity, and dedication. Unlike some of his colleagues, he did not allow his recreations, such as hunting, yachting, and golf, to interfere with his ministerial duties. As minister of labour, he was concerned that the government should not become totally identified with the Unionist Party and was determined that people in Northern Ireland should have the same standards of living as those in the rest of the United Kingdom. He particularly championed the &#145;step by step&#146; policy which ensured the automatic adoption in Northern Ireland of the main British cash social services. As minister of finance, however, he readily adopted a narrower approach to service delivery and his main concern was to keep a balanced budget and to maintain good relations with the British Treasury.<br>
<br>As a cabinet minister, Andrews was keenly aware of the increasing weakness of the government, as James Craig, first Viscount Craigavon, prime minister since 1921, lost control of affairs in the 1930s. Nevertheless, on becoming prime minister after Craigavon's death in 1940, Andrews was also at sea, since his loyalty to old colleagues prevented him from bringing in new men. His ageing government showed insufficient energy in pursuing the effort of the Second World War and its prestige and confidence were undermined by the German air raids in April&#150;May 1941, indecision over conscription, the corruption of Belfast corporation, what was seen as the weak and complacent handling of industrial relations, and confused planning for the post-war world. Dissidents forced Andrews out of office and looked for leadership to Basil Brooke (later Viscount Brookeborough), the minister of commerce and war production, who had been completely identified with the war effort. Although Andrews was convinced that his minister had conspired against him, Brooke seems to have played a passive role in the 1943 crisis, refusing to lead a party revolt, and becoming prime minister almost by default. Excluded from Brooke's new cabinet in 1943, and missing departmental responsibilities, Andrews took little solace in becoming CH (1943). He died on 5 August 1956, at his home, Maxwell Court, Comber.<br>
