<span class="headword">Day,  Angell</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1563&#150;1595), <span class="occ">stationer and writer</span>, was the son of Thomas Day (Daye), parish clerk. Though little is known of his personal life, Day was apprenticed to Thomas Duxsell, stationer in London, in 1563, beginning his service on Christmas day of that year. By 1575 Day probably had completed his apprenticeship, and on 4 December 1582 he married Frauncis Warley in London. Following the completion of his apprenticeship Day next distinguished himself as the compiler of a handbook for epistle writing entitled <span class="italic">The English Secretorie</span>, printed first in 1586 in London by Robert Waldegrave and sold by Richard Jones. Day's book was so successful that it was reprinted in 1592 and again in 1595, 1599, 1607, and 1614. Other subsequent printings occurred: one identified as &#145;now newly revised&#146;, which Pollard and Redgrave dated at 1618, and later printings which are identified as having been printed in 1621, 1625, 1626, and 1635. There also appears to have been a printing of the second part of the book alone in 1614. By the time of its final printing <span class="italic">The English Secretorie</span> had been in print regularly for almost fifty years. The second printing of the book, entered in the Stationers' register in 1587, but not printed finally until 1592, was dedicated to Sir William Hatton, to whom Day had appealed for patronage in his dedication to <span class="italic">Daphnis and Chloe</span>, also published in 1587.<br>
<br>Encouraged perhaps by the success of this early work, and urged on by the popularity of pastorals such as Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">Shepheardes Calendar</span> (1579), Day produced an adaptation of <span class="italic">Daphnis and Chloe</span>, a pastoral romance translated from the Greek into French by Jacques Amyot (printed in 1559). Day's version appeared in 1587 (also printed by Robert Waldegrave). Since its republication in a facsimile edition (1890, ed. Joseph Jacobs) literary critics have noted the poem's overt nationalism, with its idealized depiction of Queen Elizabeth as a symbol of England. Today Day's translation of <span class="italic">Daphnis and Chloe</span> survives in only one copy, now housed in the collection of the British Library.<br>
<br>Day's other literary work was more modest in scope and stature. In 1595 he published commendatory verses, <span class="italic">Nennio, or, A Treatise of Nobility</span>, a translation of the Italian humanist treatise by William Jones, &#145;gentleman&#146;, printed by Peter Short, who produced the 1599 edition of <span class="italic">The English Secretorie</span>. Two additional pieces are frequently attributed to Day. The first is the printing of a poem in six-line stanzas entitled <span class="italic">Upon the Life and Death of the most Worthy and Thrice Renowned Knight, Sir Phillip Sidney</span> by Robert Waldegrave in 1587 bearing the authorial initials &#145;A.D.&#146;. The second is a pamphlet (not dated, but thought to be <i>c</i>.1585) entitled <span class="italic">Wonderfull Strange Sightes Seene in the Element, over the Citie of London and other Places</span>.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Day's life beyond the details of his apprenticeship and his publications. Although biographers have assumed that he gave up a career as a stationer in order to pursue his writing there is, in fact, no evidence to corroborate this. If nothing else, Day's consistent association with printers such as Robert Waldegrave and booksellers such as Cuthbert Burbie and Richard Jones suggests that he retained close ties with the world of printers and booksellers throughout his literary life.<br>
