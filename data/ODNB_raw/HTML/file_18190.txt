<span class="headword">Martin,  John</span>  (1619&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 12 December 1619 in Mere, Wiltshire, the son of John Martin, a schoolmaster. He became a batteler of Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1637, moving to Oriel College when he failed to obtain a scholarship. He graduated BA in 1640 and is recorded as having an MA by 1645. Martin was ordained by Bishop Robert Skinner of Oxford on 21 December 1645 and two days later was instituted vicar of Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire, by the presentation of Sir John Penruddock, who also granted him the endowed lectureship attached to the church, worth &pound;30 a year.<br>
<br>As a bronze monument placed in the chancel observed  (Hoare, 5.87), Martin twice paid the price for his loyalty to the Stuart monarchy. The first occasion came with the civil war and its aftermath. Ejected from his benefice in 1647 for refusing the covenant, he rented a small grazing farm in nearby Tisbury, although there is reason to believe that he was reinstated before the Restoration. Martin was suspected of involvement in the unsuccessful royalist insurrection led by Colonel John Penruddock, the son of his late patron, at Salisbury in 1654, and was briefly imprisoned. After his release he sheltered Penruddock's children and, as trustee for his estate, preserved it from sequestration. Although nothing is known of his marriage, Martin may have been the father of a son John, who was born in Tisbury at this time and who later also became a clergyman. Martin welcomed the Stuart Restoration by printing a sermon, <span class="italic">Hosannah: a Thanksgiving Sermon, June 28th 1660</span> (1660), dedicated to Bishop Brian Duppa, who had instituted him, the first of four published works. This exhibits his learning and loyalty, seeing the hand of God in the restoration of &#145;the cornerstone of our Church and State&#146;  (p. 32).<br>
<br>Martin had moderate success in his career after the Restoration, and by combining several modest benefices was able to achieve an annual income of at least &pound;120, above the &pound;80 considered to be the minimum for a cleric at that time. In addition to Compton Chamberlayne, in January 1661 he was instituted as rector of Melcombe Horsey, Dorset, by the presentation of Thomas Freke. Bishop Seth Ward collated Martin to the prebend of Yatesbury in Salisbury Cathedral on 22 November 1668, moving him to the more valuable prebend of Preston on 5 October 1677. Martin was also rural dean of Chalke, but refused appointment as canon residentiary of Salisbury. In October 1675 he became chaplain to Charles, earl of Nottingham. His pluralism and failure to appoint a curate led to his presentment in 1674 for non-residence in Compton Chamberlayne. The absence of further complaints suggests that thereafter he fulfilled his promise to the churchwardens to reside and was on good terms with the congregation. Martin's attention to the siting of the pulpit and his decision to bar from communion two men embroiled in a legal dispute testify to his pastoral diligence, as does his publication of <span class="italic">Go in Peace</span> (1674), a guide for young clerics visiting the sick which he dedicated to Sir George Howe, bt, whom he described as &#145;a Lover of the clergy&#146;.<br>
<br>Martin suffered for his loyalism a second time when he lost his living in Melcombe Horsey in February 1690 and his prebendal stall in 1691 after he refused to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. Bishop Gilbert Burnet allowed him to retain the benefice of Compton Chamberlayne, however, and also claimed that he paid Martin from his own purse the annual income of the prebend from which he had been deprived, citing this example to disprove George Hickes's allegations that the bishop had victimized nonjurors in Salisbury diocese. Burnet recognized that Martin's behaviour resulted from his consistent record of loyalty to the Stuarts rather than from the troublesomeness which he disliked among many of the lesser clergy, reporting that Martin had said that &#145;he would never join the Schism with the rest of the Non-Jurors, whose Principles and Practices &hellip; he detested&#146;  (Burnet, 62&#150;3). Burnet perhaps also approved of Martin's emphasis upon pastoral visits and collation of scriptural passages in <span class="italic">Go in Peace</span>. John Martin died on 3 November 1693 in Compton Chamberlayne, where he was buried.<br>
