<span class="headword">Mactaggart, Sir  John Auld</span>, first baronet  (1867&#150;1956), <span class="occ">builder</span>, was born on 30 September 1867 in Anderton, Glasgow, the eldest son and second in the family of two sons and two daughters of Neil Mactaggart (1835&#150;1904), coppersmith, and his wife, Anne Auld (<i>d</i>. 1906). Mactaggart was educated in Glasgow and was intended for the civil service, but instead joined Robert Mickel &amp; Co., timber merchants and sawmill owners, where he was trained as a mercantile clerk, and became chief accountant at the firm's Glasgow office. In 1897 he married Margaret Lockhart, daughter of Robert Curtis, a master blacksmith, of Ramelton, co. Donegal, Ireland. They had one son and one daughter. Margaret Mactaggart died in 1927, and in 1928 Mactaggart married Elizabeth Ann 
    (Lena; <i>d</i>. 1958)
  , eldest daughter of the Revd David Orr of Govan, Glasgow. In 1898 he left Mickels to set up his own business, and until 1901 he was in partnership with the builder Robert Pollock, making concrete steps and later building tenements.<br>
<br>In 1901 Mactaggart started his own firm, J. A. Mactaggart &amp; Co. He began by manufacturing concrete pipes, steps, and lintels, but soon started to build large tenement buildings, mainly for middle-class tenants, in west and south Glasgow. Most of the houses had bathrooms: Mactaggart later claimed to be &#145;the man who had made Glasgow bathroom conscious&#146;  (Morgan, 2.154). He kept some of the properties to let himself, and by 1911 eighty-three tenements provided him with an annual rental of &pound;14,000, and also security to raise loans to buy land and finance building operations. In addition to these, Mactaggart built forty-four cottages for the English workers at the new Yarrow shipyards which opened at Scotstoun in 1908.<br>
<br>When the royal commission on housing was set up in 1913 to tackle the housing problem in Scotland, Mactaggart gave evidence, urging the reduction of local property taxes in order to encourage people to move into larger houses, thus helping to solve the problem of overcrowding. He also argued for rent control, and this led to the passing of the rent restriction acts.<br>
<br>During the First World War Mactaggart was occupied with government work, including an Admiralty contract at Gourack. In 1919 he converted the firm into a limited company. The largest shareholders were members of his family, and he became managing director. Mactaggart benefited from the 1919 <span class="roman">Addison Act</span>, which tried to fulfil the government's wartime promise to provide &#145;homes fit for heroes to live in&#146; by obliging local authorities to undertake housing schemes, and providing large subsidies to enable them to do so. His most important single contract was the Mosspark housing scheme for 1502 houses for Glasgow corporation, worth &pound;1.8 million, which Mactaggart completed despite shortage of building materials and disputes with the trade unions. At the same time, through a consortium made up of his wife and other members of his family, Mactaggart was buying land in Glasgow with a view to future property development, including land at King's Park, to the south of the city, and 114 acres of the Kelvinside estate, at its west end.<br>
<br>In 1924 J. A. Mactaggart Ltd went into voluntary liquidation, and Mactaggart's son Jack, and his partner, Andrew Mickel (nephew of Mactaggart's former employer, Robert Mickel), formed Mactaggart and Mickel Ltd, with John Mactaggart as the largest shareholder, to concentrate on building houses for private owner-occupiers, while John Mactaggart took over the Western Heritable Investment Company Ltd in 1925. He applied for permission to build blocks of cottage flats at King's Park, subsidized under the terms of the 1924 <span class="roman">Housing Act</span> which promised subsidies to build houses for rent. Mactaggart had encouraged the MP John Wheatley to include these clauses in the bill. By 1930 he had completed 1356 houses, not only subsidized under the 1924 act, but also financed by Glasgow corporation through loans of 75 per cent of the value of the completed houses. In 1931 agreement was reached for a subsidy and loans for a further 1512 houses at King's Park. Following this he built subsidized houses at Kelvinside, and on corporation land at Cardonald. Altogether the company built 6038 houses for rent with subsidies offered by the 1924 act.<br>
<br>Mactaggart turned his attention to the London property market in the 1930s. He formed a new company, the London Heritable Investment Company Ltd, which developed luxury flats on a site in Park Lane, next to the Dorchester Hotel, between 1935 and 1938. After the Second World War he formed a new company, Grove End Gardens Ltd, which built and managed luxury flats in St John's Wood. He visited the United States in 1936 to study housing conditions, and was asked by President Roosevelt to prepare a memorandum. Increasingly consulted by the government as an authority on housing, Mactaggart was created a baronet in 1938.<br>
<br>Although at one time a socialist, and a member of the Independent Labour Party from 1889 to 1902, Mactaggart joined the Liberal Party in 1902 and became secretary of the Glasgow branch, although he refused to stand for election either to Glasgow corporation or to parliament. In 1930 he gave the house and grounds of the Aitkenhead estate, next to the King's Park development, to Glasgow corporation, to be preserved as a public park. He financed the Peace Pavilion at the 1938 Glasgow Empire Exhibition, and, always interested in the film industry, he gave &pound;5000 towards the building of the cinema at the exhibition. Mactaggart was a member of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, to which he read a paper on housing and planning in 1943. He was also a JP for Glasgow. His interests spread beyond Scotland: he founded the American and British Commonwealth Association in 1941 (it was merged with the English-Speaking Union in 1947), served as president of the Economic Research Council, and was elected president of the National Federation of Property Owners for 1950&#150;52.<br>
<br>Mactaggart died at his Glasgow home, Kelmscott, 110 Springkell Avenue, Pollokshields, on 24 November 1956.<br>
