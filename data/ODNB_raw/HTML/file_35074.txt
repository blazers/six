<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Montagu,  Edwin Samuel</span>  (1879&#150;1924), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 6 February 1879 at 12 Kensington Palace Gardens, London. He was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35076/', "Samuel Montagu, the first Baron Swaythling (1832&#150;1911)")</script>, a millionaire banker and later Liberal MP, and his wife, Ellen (1848&#150;1919), daughter of Louis Cohen, a member of the prominent Jewish banking family of Liverpool. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53683/', "Henrietta Franklin (1866&#150;1964)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40837/', "Lilian Helen Montagu (1873&#150;1963)")</script> were his elder sisters.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyyears"></a>Education and early years</h2>From 1887 to 1891 Montagu attended Doreck College, a preparatory school in Kensington Gardens Square. In 1891 he was sent to a boarding-school, Clifton College, where he did not settle, suffering from frequent bouts of homesickness, especially missing his mother, to whom he was very close. Severe headaches resulted in his being sent on a recuperative sea voyage round the world from December 1891 to April 1892, accompanied by a young tutor, J. D. Israel. His personal unhappiness was reflected in increasingly poor grades and he was removed from Clifton on 7 April 1893, being enrolled soon after in the City of London School.<br>
<br>Though an intelligent student with an interest in the sciences, Montagu was not strongly academic and his full potential was not reflected in school reports. He cared little for sport, but took a keen interest in ornithology, shooting, and walking, which became lifelong passions. In December 1895 he entered University College, London, specializing in biology, and in June 1896 was placed in the first division, being awarded an exhibition and gold medal in the bachelor of science examination. Although he failed in his attempt to pass the inter-science degree exam in July 1897, he succeeded a year later. After briefly attending University College Hospital as a medical student, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1898.<br>
<br>Montagu's years at Cambridge were eventful. In strictly academic terms he was an undistinguished student, obtaining a second in part 1 (1900) and a third in part 2 (1902) of the natural sciences tripos. Instead, he made his mark in the extracurricular field as a witty and eloquent debater, editor, and amateur dramatist. He was elected librarian (and later acting president) of the Amateur Dramatic Club in 1900, president of the Magpie and Stump (the celebrated Trinity College debating society); and secretary (1902) then president (1903) of the prestigious Liberal club. Finally, after two unsuccessful attempts, he was elected president of the Cambridge Union in 1902.<h2>
<a name="Liberalpolitics"></a>Liberal politics</h2>Montagu increasingly focused his energies in two areas&#151;the law and politics. In 1903 he started work with Messrs Coward Hawksley and Chance, solicitors, at 30 Mincing Lane, London, and later in 1904 in the chambers of Mr Pollock KC. In November 1905 he passed the constitutional law section of the bar examination. However, he disliked studying law and realized that the legal profession did not appeal to him as a short cut into politics. Instead, he paid greater attention to the political arena itself. In autumn 1903 he went to Canada with Auberon Herbert in order to test the &#145;imperial value&#146; of Joseph Chamberlain's imperial preference proposals. Montagu and Herbert were free-trade imperialists and their book, <span class="italic">Canada and the Empire: an Examination of Trade Preferences</span> (1904), argued vigorously that Canada did not wish to receive imperial preference.<br>
<br>While at Cambridge, Montagu had come to the attention of Liberal leaders, especially H. H. Asquith, as an intelligent and eloquent debater at the Liberal club. He also began speaking for the Liberal Party at meetings throughout the country, earning a reputation as an up-and-coming Liberal of radical opinions. He was rewarded for his exertions when he was adopted as the Liberal candidate for the West Cambridgeshire (Chesterton) constituency, and was elected to parliament as part of the Liberal landslide of 1906. He held the seat until 1918, representing the combined county of Cambridgeshire from 1918 until November 1922.<br>
<br>Montagu rose to prominence under Asquith's wing, beginning a close political and personal partnership that lasted until the end of Asquith's premiership, serving as his parliamentary private secretary when the latter was chancellor of the exchequer from February 1906, and retaining his post when Asquith became prime minister in 1908. Among Montagu's chief concerns during these years was land reform, in which his constituency's strongly rural character gave him a special interest. He took an interest, also, in fiscal issues, and his calls for the reform of the tax system (and especially income tax), while not always successful, highlighted his radicalism.<h2>
<a name="IndiaOfficeTreasuryandwarcabinet"></a>India Office, Treasury, and war cabinet</h2>Montagu's official connection with India began in early 1910 when he was appointed under-secretary of state at the India Office, serving under lords Morley and Crewe until February 1914. His maiden Indian budget speech in July 1910 was a <i>tour de force</i> and marked him out for a considerable political future. Apart from financial issues, Montagu concerned himself with political matters, particularly the growing unrest in India. While acknowledging that demands for increasing political participation emanated from a small section of the educated intelligentsia, he nevertheless asserted the importance of responding to the challenging nationalist climate constructively in order to avoid major conflagration, for &#145;the amount of yeast necessary to leaven a loaf is very small&#146;. In 1912 he left for his first tour of the Indian subcontinent, being keen to establish a personal understanding of the land, its people, and its problems. Accompanied by his brother Lionel, Montagu's visit enabled him to make valuable contacts with several influential Indians (including politicians and princes) that endured for the rest of his career and cemented a growing passion for the Indian empire.<br>
<br>In February 1914 Montagu became financial secretary to the Treasury, and held several posts between 1914 and 1917. He joined the cabinet (and was sworn of the privy council) in February 1915 as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. However, in May he was replaced by Winston Churchill and returned to his former post at the Treasury with the formation of the first coalition ministry. During his second tenure at the Treasury he played a leading role in popularizing the first war loans and in establishing voluntary war savings associations and the issue of war savings certificates (February 1916). In July 1916 he was appointed minister of munitions with a seat on the war committee of the cabinet. An agreement he made with J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. saved the allies millions of pounds in their American purchases.<br>
<br>Forced to resign with the fall of Asquith's coalition in December 1916, Montagu continued to harbour hopes of re-entering the government. The opportunity first arose in January 1917 when the new prime minister, Lloyd George, offered him a cabinet post as minister without portfolio in charge of reconstruction. Montagu accepted, much to the annoyance of the Asquithian Liberals, becoming vice-chairman of a second reconstruction committee with Lloyd George as its titular head.<h2>
<a name="SecretaryofstateforIndia19171922"></a>Secretary of state for India, 1917&#150;1922</h2>These were eventful years in the history of the subcontinent, with a growing nationalist movement and an increasing realization among the British ruling &eacute;lite that more co-operation and political reform were urgently required. Such concerns were made more acute by India's immense contribution to the war effort. Montagu was impatient to play an active part in this process and hoped to succeed Lord Hardinge as viceroy in 1915. &#145;Indian problems attract me with an intensity&#151;which I can find for no other problems. I have no other ambition save to go to India&#146;  (Kaul, &#145;Press and empire&#146;, 112). Although unsuccessful in his bid to become viceroy, his interest in the governance of India found unexpected fulfilment when, following the resignation in July 1917 of the Conservative secretary of state, Austen Chamberlain, Montagu was appointed in his place. Montagu was the last Liberal and only Jew to become secretary of state, and his period of office constituted a turning point in the history of the raj.<br>
<br>Montagu inherited a difficult situation, and one of his first acts was to make a clear statement of the government's position on future constitutional advance for India, a position which had broad cross-party support and had been drafted by the former viceroy, Lord Curzon. His historic pronouncement in the Commons in August 1917 declared that:<blockquote>The policy of His Majesty's Government, with which the Government of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration, and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.(&#145;Report on Indian constitutional reforms&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1918, 8.60, Cd 9109; also S. Char, ed., <span class="italic">Readings in the Constitutional History of India</span>, 1983, 457)</blockquote>Montagu was personally committed to this process, and his enthusiasm was evidenced by his decision in winter 1917&#150;18 to undertake an extensive tour of India in order to ascertain public opinion at first hand and formulate with the viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, a concrete scheme for constitutional reform. Apart from a brief visit by Crewe accompanying the king for the Delhi durbar in 1912, no secretary of state had officially visited the subcontinent over whose destinies they presided, and Montagu's tour proved a landmark. He kept a daily record of the visit, published posthumously as <span class="italic">An Indian Diary</span> (1930). The <span class="italic">Diary</span> reveals his frank opinions on a range of issues, including the nature of the political problems confronting India; the need for major reforms and an overhaul of the machinery of empire; the hundreds of Indian political delegations he received; his frustration at what he considered unnecessary bureaucracy and the inherent conservatism of the Indian Civil Service; his fluctuating and often less than charitable views of Chelmsford; as well as the pleasures of dining, shooting, and birdwatching with his many friends in princely India.<h2>
<a name="TheMontaguChelmsfordreforms"></a>The Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms</h2>The resultant Montagu&#150;Chelmsford report of July 1918 formed the basis of the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span>, which formally entered the statute book in December 1919. One of the major innovations was the introduction of diarchy, or dual government (the concept being first mooted by Lionel Curtis and the Round Table organization), under which there was to be a devolution of power and responsibility in the executive and legislative spheres to Indian administrators elected on a restricted franchise at the provincial level. Subjects &#145;transferred&#146; to Indian ministers included education, agriculture, and local self-government, although several &#145;reserved&#146; subjects such as irrigation, police, the press, finance, and justice were retained under British control. Reserve powers were also vested in the governors and the viceroy, and the central government retained overriding powers. A bicameral system was set up at the centre with the legislative assembly having elected majorities but no control over ministers. The electorates were enlarged to 5.5 million in the provinces and 1.5 million in the imperial legislature.<br>
<br>Apart from the moderates, most Indian nationalist leaders criticized the report and subsequent act for promising much but delivering little actual power into Indian hands, given the impractical division of duties through diarchy, the fact that politically less important departments were transferred to Indians with limited funds, the extension of the system of separate electorates, and the extensive veto powers retained by the British. Provincial diarchy was, in fact, subsequently revoked in the 1935 act. Nevertheless, the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms did represent an important step in the advance of self-government and a stage on the road to the complete devolution of constitutional power.<br>
<br>The constitutional process was jeopardized, however, by the political repercussions of the government of India's clumsy handling of disturbances during 1919, and in particular by the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh in Amritsar. The officiating General Dyer was eventually dismissed from the army and the Hunter committee report (1920) was critical of official actions. Montagu was appalled by the massacre and by the justifications offered by Dyer and his supporters, and in the Commons spoke out against the evils of racial arrogance and government by &#145;terrorism&#146;. However, his emotional outburst was resented by a significant section of the Conservative-dominated Commons, and die-hard back-benchers called for his resignation. He withstood the opposition, but his political position was severely shaken.<br>
<br>The non-cooperation movement (1920&#150;22) was a further testing period for the secretary of state as the raj witnessed unprecedented India-wide opposition. Montagu, as head of the government of India, was increasingly blamed in parliament for the troubles, while Lord Reading, the new viceroy, adopted a cautious policy, preferring to avoid or postpone confrontation. To Montagu's critics this implied weakness and a lack of decisive leadership, and his position in the Commons grew increasingly precarious. Ironically, Montagu enjoyed a more harmonious relationship with Reading. They were friends and liberal Jews who shared a common approach to imperial policy and governance, had worked together during the war, and were temperamentally better suited&#151;Reading's charm, diplomacy, and political pragmatism proving a useful counterfoil to Montagu's impetuousness and idealism.<br>
<br>Montagu was eventually compelled to resign from the India Office on 9 March 1922, following his decision to publish the views of the Indian government on the revision of the treaty of S&egrave;vres without previously consulting his cabinet colleagues&#151;thus flouting the principle of collective responsibility. These views were critical of Lloyd George's anti-Turkish stance in the conflict between Greece and Turkey, an attitude which aroused strong feeling among the Muslim population of India. Montagu felt he had been harshly treated by Lloyd George at the instigation in particular of Curzon, the foreign secretary. Montagu and Lloyd George were not close, and when the prime minister's position as the Liberal head of a Conservative-dominated coalition became more precarious Montagu, who was increasingly seen as a political liability, represented a convenient scapegoat. His earlier betrayal of Asquith meant that he was now politically isolated, and in the general election of November 1922 he lost his seat.<h2>
<a name="Personallifefamilyandreligion"></a>Personal life, family, and religion</h2>Montagu was a tall, slim man with a reflective and studious manner. His appearance was striking rather than handsome, with large eyes, black moustache, dark hair, and a receding hairline on a large head, a dark and faintly pock-marked complexion, with a monocle producing a slightly owlish effect. His first love was the natural world. He was a keen ornithologist and was active in the pursuit of country sports, especially shooting. He devoted considerable time and expenditure to renovating his country residence, Breccles Hall near Attleborough in Norfolk, which he purchased in 1916. Along with Lord Grey of Fallodon he established a bird sanctuary at nearby Hickling Broad.<br>
<br>Despite an apparently abundant and successful life, Montagu frequently appeared a solitary and insecure figure. His incisive eloquence and often abrupt manner won him few political friends and helped to alienate potential allies. He was rarely relaxed, was painfully self-deprecating, and suffered a range of health, marital, familial, and religious problems. After a protracted, and not always smooth, courtship Montagu married on 26 July 1915 the Hon. Beatrice Venetia (1887&#150;1948), youngest daughter of Edward Lyulph Stanley, fourth Baron Sheffield and Baron Stanley of Alderley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41069/', "Stanley, (Beatrice) Venetia")</script>]. Their relationship lacked passion, and Montagu bravely tolerated his wife's many indiscretions&#151;her affair with Lord Beaverbrook being only the most prominent&#151;and her profligate and expensive lifestyle. The triangular relationship between Asquith, Montagu, and Venetia created a major stir in society circles and widened the rift between mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Montagu's close personal friendship with the Asquith family, including Asquith's wife, Margot, meant that his marriage to Venetia and subsequent decision to join Lloyd George's government were highly damaging personally as well as politically.<br>
<br>Montagu had always had a tempestuous relationship with his father, finding his insistence on the strict observance of the Orthodox Jewish faith intellectually and temperamentally hard to countenance. His relationship with his father remained a source of strain, both emotional and financial, into adulthood, as Samuel Montagu used his monetary control over his son to enforce his Orthodox opinions. Samuel Montagu had financed his son's university and legal studies, and paid &pound;500 p.a. as support for his political career. The result was conflict and resentment and a continual financial straightjacket for Montagu. Even after his father's death, when he had an annual income of &pound;10,000 p.a., Venetia was compelled to convert to Judaism upon marriage in order to save his inheritance. For Montagu, religion was a purely personal affair; he had no formal religious beliefs, was anti-Zionist, and constantly emphasized his foremost identity as a Briton.<h2>
<a name="Antisemitism"></a>Antisemitism</h2>It has been contended that, although Montagu was not a practising Jew, religious persecution afflicted him throughout his life and helped to destroy his career. His case exemplifies a fundamental paradox in English society: namely, that while England permitted Jews to climb to the pinnacle of economic and political success, it condoned antisemitism  (Levine, 4&#150;5). However, concrete links between religious persecution and the ultimate fate of Montagu as a politician are tenuous and can be exaggerated, as no doubt they often were in Montagu's own mind. Personal and political differences were often confused, and developments in his career owed more to a combination of factors within and outside his control than to overt religious bigotry.<br>
<br>This is not to deny that antisemitism was a constant undermining factor in his political life. Conservative critics often portrayed him as unreliable, disreputable, and corrupt on grounds of his religion. In 1913, while under-secretary at the India Office, Montagu had to endure antisemitic taunts in parliament and in the press in connection with the contracts of his cousin, Sir Stuart Samuel, and his father's firm, Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., to supply silver to the Indian government. Montagu had played no part in these proceedings, but though cleared of all charges of corruption he was tainted by the connection. Subsequently, during the Dyer debates in parliament, Montagu riled the Conservative back-benchers. Although his words were insensitive, there is no doubt that antisemitism was a component of the strong reaction they evoked. However, it is important to consider the fate of Montagu in the light of other factors, including the momentous changes that he helped to effect in India, his advanced and idealist views on Britain's imperial mission, his penetrating criticism of Indian government officials, his popularity among Indian politicians, his alienation of key political affiliations in the domestic context, and no doubt his overall political tactlessness. As he himself noted to Chelmsford:<blockquote>You see you and I are so much more vulnerable than any other Secretary of State and Viceroy because we have set our signatures to plans and proposals which are controversial &hellip; when beaten in the attacks on our scheme, they find it easier to attack us. (Kaul, &#145;Press and empire&#146;, 121)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Twilightyears19221924"></a>Twilight years, 1922&#150;1924</h2>India had been Montagu's lifelong passion and after his dismissal he was, in significant respects, a broken man. He continued to work half-heartedly on a number of business ventures and always planned to revisit India, though he never did. In February 1923 he became vice-chairman of the board of De Beers, and later that year joined the board of the Underground Electric Railways and the board of the Metropolitan and District Railway Company. He was a deeply unhappy man in the last years of his life, and continued to suffer from stress and a variety of medical symptoms. Though these were not always serious, he remained preoccupied with premonitions of an early death. On his return from a trip to Brazil (December 1923 to January 1924), undertaken in his capacity as chairman of a British financial mission sent to advise the government on financial and banking reforms, he complained of sickness.<br>
<br>Montagu's condition worsened, though doctors were unable to agree on a diagnosis. He was admitted to a nursing home at 7 Queen Anne Street, London, in autumn 1924, and died there on 15 November 1924. The cause of death was given as a combination of arteriosclerosis and septicaemia coma. He was buried, in accordance with his wishes, in the grounds of his beloved Breccles, on 20 November, in a private ceremony without a religious service&#151;though a rabbi, Vivian G. Simmons, officiated at the gravesite. A public memorial service, at the behest of his family, was held on 21 November in the West London Synagogue, which Venetia did not attend. He left his property equally divided between Venetia and a daughter, Judith, born in February 1923, though there is some weight in the speculation that her father was, in fact, Eric Ednam, the third earl of Dudley.<br>
