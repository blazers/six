<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Picton, Sir  James Allanson</span>  (1805&#150;1889), <span class="occ">antiquary and architect</span>, the son of William Pickton, a joiner and timber merchant, was born in Highfield Street, Liverpool, on 2 December 1805. After an elementary education at Richard Prior's school, Church Lane, St Peter's, Liverpool, he entered his father's business at the age of thirteen. A few years later he joined the office of Daniel Stewart, an architect and surveyor, to whose business he ultimately succeeded. On 28 April 1828 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of Henry Pooley, a Liverpool iron-founder; they had six children. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35527/', "James Allanson Picton")</script>, was MP for Leicester from 1884 to 1894; another son, William Henry Picton, was later the architectural partner of his father. Picton executed some important buildings in and about Liverpool, including the corn exchange and Richmond Buildings, an office block where he used three storeys of round-arched openings forming arcades, &#145;a good solution to the problem of letting in light&#146;  (Dixon and Muthesius, 127). He also became an authority on land arbitration, an expertise which he subsequently used to good effect for the city council.<br>
<br>Picton soon became involved in the public life of Liverpool, and became a member of the town council in 1849; he was also a member of the Wavertree local board from its establishment in 1851, and its chairman from soon after this date. Immediately after joining the Liverpool town council, Picton started campaigning for a public library for the borough, an idea which had first been mooted in 1848. Claiming that public libraries performed a vital civic role, fostering social unity and cultural harmony, he advocated support from public funds rather than private philanthropy. In 1852, as a result of his advocacy, a special act of parliament was obtained to authorize the levying of a penny rate for the support of a public library and museum. The pioneering new institution thus founded grew to be one of the most important of its kind. Sir William Brown subsequently provided magnificent buildings for the library and museum in 1860, and in 1879 the corporation added the fine Picton Reading Room, modelled on that of the British Library in London. Picton was appointed as first chairman of the library and museum committee in 1851, a position which he retained until death.<br>
<br>Although a Gladstonian Liberal in politics, Picton believed that party loyalties should not influence the conduct of local affairs; on certain matters he voted with the Conservative members of the town council. His colleagues were not so minded, and it is probable that his Liberalism prevented his appointment as mayor, alderman, or MP; his attainments and public services did, however, earn him a knighthood in July 1881. By the mid-1880s Picton was increasingly concerned by the growth of the immigrant Irish community in Liverpool and the accompanying spread of slum districts; he believed, moreover, that the homeless Irish of the city had links with the Fenian movement.<br>
<br>Picton's political commitment was combined with a strong Christian faith. He took part in local religious and philanthropic work, and edited a controversial magazine, the <span class="italic">Watchman's Lantern</span>, started in 1834 by the Liverpool Methodist Association. Picton was, in fact, a Congregationalist who attended the Great George Street Chapel of the famous Thomas Raffles, but he as readily accepted diversity in religion as he did in politics: he once declared that he could worship with fellow Christians ranging &#145;from Roman Catholics to Ranters&#146;. His publications included <span class="italic">Modern Christian Faith</span> (1884), and the <span class="italic">Liverpool Pulpit</span> of February 1895 praised him for his &#145;civic patriotism&#146;.<br>
<br>Picton had wide-ranging historical, scientific, and linguistic interests. He was a promoter of the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution, founded in 1824, a president of the Liverpool Philomathic Society, founded in 1825 to promote &#145;learning by discussion&#146;, the literary and philosophical society, the architectural society, the geological society, and other local societies. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of other archaeological and scientific associations, and a frequent contributor to their journals, as well as to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>; between 1853 and 1876 he also published pieces in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, founded in 1848. In 1858 he published his <span class="italic">Architectural History of Liverpool</span>, which was followed by his well-known work <span class="italic">Memorials of Liverpool, Historical and Topographical</span> (1873&#150;5), which became an inspiration to subsequent local historians of Liverpool. He subsequently edited <span class="italic">Selections from the Liverpool Municipal Archives and Records, 1207&#150;1835</span> (2 vols., 1883&#150;6). Picton's linguistic interests were diverse: well read in the classics of Greek and Roman literature, he had a good knowledge of modern languages, and even of Hebrew and Sanskrit. His publications reflected his wide range: they include <span class="italic">Philosophical Papers, comprising Notes on the Ancient Gothic Language &hellip; and Sanskrit Roots and English Derivations</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Our Mother Tongue</span> (1869), and <span class="italic">The South Lancashire Dialect</span> (1865). Some of Picton's many other interests are indicated by the titles of such works as <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Changes of Sea-Levels on the West Coast of England</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">On the Origins and History of the Numerals</span> (1874).<br>
<br>Picton died on 15 July 1889 at his home, Sandyknowe, Wavertree, near Liverpool, and was buried at Toxteth Park cemetery. He played a prominent role in Liverpool in forging and maintaining the fruitful links between local history, civic pride, and liberal learning.<br>
