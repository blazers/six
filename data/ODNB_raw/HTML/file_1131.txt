<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1568&#150;1645), <span class="occ">religious writer and historian</span>, was born at Sissinghurst, Kent, the elder son of John Baker (<i>b</i>. in or before 1531, <i>d</i>. 1604&times;6), MP in 1554&#150;5 and lawyer, and Catherine, daughter of Reginald Scott, of Scots Hall, Ashford, Kent. His father was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1124/', "Sir John Baker (c.1489&#150;1558)")</script>, of Sissinghurst, by his second marriage, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1558), daughter of Thomas Dingley of Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, and Middle Aston, Oxfordshire. Sir Richard Baker has to be distinguished from his uncle Richard (<i>b</i>. in or before 1530, <i>d</i>. 1594), also a knight, who was Sir John's elder son and heir. The historian's father, John Baker, had moved to London, where he was a member of the Inner Temple, and in Michaelmas term 1584 Richard Baker, described as a gentleman, of Kent, matriculated at Oxford from Hart Hall. Contemporaries there included John Donne, and Baker shared a room with Henry Wotton, the diplomat, who was then a commoner of New College. Like Donne, Baker left the hall without graduating, and after studying law in London he travelled on the continent, acquiring languages and journeying as far east as Poland; after his return he was granted the degree of MA by decree, in 1594.<br>
<br>Baker sat in the Commons as member for Arundel in 1593 and East Grinstead in 1597, probably as a nominee of Thomas, Lord Buckhurst, his uncle by marriage. He served and reported on a Commons committee on the weaving trade in 1597. In 1603, when he was knighted by James I at Theobalds, he was living in Highgate in north London. He was a JP for Middlesex, and he also had lands in Essex, Gloucestershire, Kent, and Oxfordshire, where he had inherited the manor of Middle Aston. He served as high sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1620&#150;21. Shortly afterwards he married Margaret (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1600), daughter of Sir George Mainwaring of Ightfield, Shropshire. They had at least five children&#151;two sons and three daughters survived them&#151;but the alliance proved even more ill-starred than John Aubrey's unlucky contract with Joan Sumner, another paradigm of the age. To the entire ruin of his fortune, Baker gave security for his father-in-law's debts. By 1625 he was a crown debtor, and his Oxfordshire estate was impounded. Within ten years his other lands had followed, and he was reduced to living in the Fleet prison in London for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>With his lands and offices gone, Baker turned, as his friend Thomas Fuller observed, to the consolations of scholarship. He seems to have kept his books, or some of them, with him in the Fleet, and he manifestly had access to printers. His first published work was an essay in popular moralism: <span class="italic">Cato variegatus, or, Catoes Morall Distichs, Translated and Paraphrased with Variations of Expressing in English Verse</span>, which appeared in 1636. He followed it with <span class="italic">Meditations on the Lord's Prayer</span> in 1637, and a translation of the letters of J.-L. Guez de Balzac (1597&#150;1654) in 1638. The renderings and variations of Cato's themes were only moderately inspired, but Baker's religious writings struck a popular response. He produced a series of meditations on the penitential psalms, beginning with <span class="italic">Meditations and Disquisitions on the Seven Psalmes of David</span>, published in 1639 and dedicated to Mary, countess of Dorset, with an additional study of <span class="roman">Psalms</span> 102, 130, and 143 dedicated to Henry Montagu, earl of Manchester. A further study of <span class="roman">Psalm 23</span> followed in 1640, and <span class="italic">An Apologie for Laymen's Writing in Divinity, with a Short Meditation upon the Fall of Lucifer</span> in 1641. The <span class="italic">Apologie</span> was dedicated to his cousin Sir John Baker of Sissinghurst (<i>d</i>. 1661), and <span class="italic">Motives for Prayer upon the Seaven Dayes of the Weeke</span> (1642), a meditative work on the creation of the world, to Sir John's wife, Elizabeth. Sir John Baker's adherence to the king in the early years of the civil war began the final decline in the family's fortunes.<br>
<br>Richard Baker also wrote a rebuttal of Prynne's <span class="italic">Histrio-Mastix</span> which remained in manuscript until 1662, when it was published posthumously under the title <span class="italic">Theatrum redivivum, or, The Theatre Vindicated</span>. It was characterized by much common sense, and contained notices of Alleyn, Burbage, and Tarlton. It was reprinted in 1670 as <span class="italic">Theatrum triumphans</span>. The meditations on the psalms, some of which were reprinted at Leipzig in 1688, were collected and edited by Alexander Balloch Grosart in 1882.<br>
<br>While his pious and occasional works were appearing in print, Baker was also reflecting on history. He translated a study of Tacitus by Vergilio, marchese di Malvezzi, probably on a commission from Richard and Thomas Whittaker, printers and booksellers, who published it as <span class="italic">Discourses upon Cornelius Tacitus</span> in 1642. By that time Baker had almost completed his principal work, <span class="italic">A Chronicle of the Kings of England from the Time of the Romans' Government unto the Death of King James</span>, which was published in 1643. It was dedicated to Charles, prince of Wales, and contained a commendatory letter from Sir Henry Wotton. In his preface Baker refers to the distinction between histories, which were literary exercises reflecting upon matters of state, and chronicles, which could touch on &#145;meaner accidents&#146;&#151;the prosaic detail of everyday life. He made a robust defence of his labours and listed more than ninety authors and texts which he had consulted. His narrative is lively, often but not excessively anecdotal, and he took notice of what would later be called literary, social, and even economic affairs.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was reprinted posthumously with some revisions in 1653, and a third edition was published in 1660 with a continuation to the end of 1658 by Edward Phillips, John Milton's nephew. Five more editions, with extended continuations, appeared from 1665 to 1684, when an abridgement was also published. The ninth edition was printed in 1696. The later editors were anonymous, though the account of Charles II's restoration, which first appeared in 1665, was attributed to General Monck's brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Clarges. The last edition of the work, extended to the end of the reign of George I, appeared in 1730 and was reprinted in 1733.<br>
<br>Baker's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was translated into Dutch as early as 1649, and republished in Amsterdam in 1681. There was evidently a steady demand for it in England, though it was sharply criticized by Thomas Blount, in <span class="italic">Animadversions upon Sir Richard Baker's Chronicle and its Continuation</span> (1672). Blount was learned, and given to publishing animadversions. Some of his strictures were merely captious, but Baker's frankly engaging narrative was perhaps already at odds with the emergent historical scholarship evident in the works of Rymer and Madox. Thomas Hearne commented in 1721 that the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> was a slight work but that it had become rare and expensive; he lived to see its tenth edition nine years later. Daines Barrington subsequently observed that Addison had done Baker a disservice by noting that Sir Roger de Coverley thought highly of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> and kept it close to hand. No doubt it had an old-fashioned air before the middle of the eighteenth century, but even so James Boswell turned to it in 1785 for the epigraph of his <span class="italic">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>.<br>
<br>Both the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> and its critics have to be seen in a historical context. Baker intended his narrative to be readable, and so it proved. It was vigorous enough to survive successive extensions, and for three-quarters of a century it was effectively unrivalled on its own ground. More specialized studies aside, a new era began only in 1725, with Nicholas Tindal's translation of Rapin's <span class="italic">History</span>; it continued from 1752 onwards with Hume's work. In some respects, Baker was closer to his older sources than to the world of his readers. On the one hand he had read law in Elizabeth's London and had spoken in her parliaments. On the other he cites without elaboration a story of Froissart about a knight who knew instantaneously of events occurring at a great distance. He was thoroughly a man of his own time, who wrote in unpromising circumstances, keeping his good humour and wide sympathies, and his work proved surprisingly durable.<br>
<br>Baker died in the Fleet on 18 February 1645 and was buried in St Bride's Church. His daughters married London tradesmen, one of whom is said to have burned an autograph manuscript of Baker's life, a loss which was regretted by Isaac D'Israeli. Baker's printed books, or a substantial number of them, were acquired by Archbishop John Williams, who gave them to the chapter library of Westminster Abbey as one of his many benefactions there.<br>
