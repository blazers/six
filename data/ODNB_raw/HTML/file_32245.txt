<span class="headword">Calderon,  George Leslie</span>  (1868&#150;1915), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in St John's Wood, London, on 2 December 1868, the fifth son of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4373/', "Philip Hermogenes Calderon, RA (1833&#150;1898)")</script> and his wife, Clara Marianne, daughter of James Payne Storey. He was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he gained a second in classics in 1891. He was called to the bar in 1894, but turned to literature and journalism for support. Calderon spent the years 1895&#150;7 at St Petersburg, and he returned with a profound knowledge of Russian and a lasting bent towards Slavonic studies. In November 1900 he married Katharine, widow of his college friend Archibald Ripley, and daughter of John Hamilton, of Brown Hall, co. Donegal. The couple lived at Hampstead, and had no children.<br>
<br>From 1900 to 1903 Calderon held the post of specialist in Slavonic literature on the library staff of the British Museum. During this period he wrote two stories in a vein of ironic extravaganza, <span class="italic">Downy V. Green</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">Dwala</span> (1904). In 1906 he spent several months in the South Seas, writing a collection of impressions called <span class="italic">Tahiti by Tihoti</span>, eventually published in 1921.<br>
<br>Calderon was best known as a dramatist, and his first play, <span class="italic">The Fountain</span>, was produced by the Stage Society in 1909; it was followed by <span class="italic">The Little Stone House</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Revolt</span> (1912), and a few shorter pieces. Two volumes of his collected plays were published posthumously in 1922 by Grant Richards. Among these plays, in strong contrast with the rest, is a tragedy in blank verse, <span class="italic">Cromwell: Mall o' Monks</span>.<br>
<br>Calderon's gift as a dramatist inhered in a quick eye for modern character, and a remarkable command of vivid and expressive dialogue. Calderon's plays were carefully designed for the conditions of the stage, and it was perhaps an accident that none of them had a popular success. Nevertheless, <span class="italic">The Times</span> wrote of his death as &#145;the heaviest blow which struck the English drama during the war&#146;.<br>
<br>Calderon's work was always to some extent hampered by his great versatility. He was primarily a man of letters; but he might equally have been a scholar, a publicist, an adventurer. He was an exceptional linguist, translating Chekhov's <span class="italic">The Cherry Orchard</span> and <span class="italic">The Seagull</span> into English for publication in 1912. He also took an active and enterprising part in various public affairs, and was especially known as the secretary and passionate campaigner for The Men's League for Opposing Women's Suffrage, whose arguments he promoted in lecture tours and in his book <span class="italic">Woman in Relation to the State</span> (1908).<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914 Calderon was determined, in spite of his age, to reach the fighting line. He went to France as an interpreter, was wounded in the first battle of Ypres, and in May 1915 was sent, with a commission in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, to the Dardanelles, where he was attached to the King's Own Scottish Borderers. He was reported wounded and missing in the action of 4 June 1915, and was afterwards presumed killed on that date.<br>
