<span class="headword">Hartley,  Henry Robinson</span>  (1777&#150;1850), <span class="occ">eccentric and philanthropist</span>, was born on 12 November 1777 in Southampton, second and only surviving child of Henry Hartley (1731&#150;1800) and his wife, Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lavender (1742&#150;1821). His father inherited a prosperous wine business from a childless uncle, George Robinson, and, despite intermittent service as mayor of Southampton and as a justice of the peace, appears to have been a taciturn and retiring individual. The atmosphere in the Hartley home was strict, probably reflecting a strong Calvinist faith.<br>
<br>Hartley attended Southampton grammar school (from about 1787) where he exhibited pronounced intellectual talents, although he did not attend a university. Scholarly interests were to dominate his life and he showed little aptitude for other occupations. Upon leaving school, in 1794 or 1795, Hartley lived at home, chafing at its restraints. He adopted, and briefly practised, a philosophy of libertinism, possibly based on the French <i>philosophes</i>' conception of personal liberty, fuelling an adolescent rebellion against a puritanical father  (Anderson, 77). This phase of Hartley's youth left him with a distaste for the restrictions of English society and with a severe venereal infection which would cause him great suffering throughout his life and may have increased his susceptibility to depression.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1798 Hartley married Celia Ann Crowcher (1779&#150;1848), a chance acquaintance, over the objections of his parents. The failure of this marriage further encouraged him to emigrate, but ill health and a deep attachment to his native Southampton made him hesitate. The marriage was annulled in 1802, after Celia had given birth to a daughter. The child was almost certainly not Hartley's and was never acknowledged by him.<br>
<br>Upon the death of his mother in 1821, Hartley inherited a considerable fortune and continued to live a reclusive and scholarly existence in his family home in Southampton. Unable to accept any change in his neighbourhood and irritated by the presence of small businesses in his district, Hartley quarrelled with his neighbours, closed his house, and travelled to Calais in 1825, where he lived until 1838. Unable to settle, he returned to England, living in Southwark, London, between 1838 and 1846. In 1842 he made a will leaving the bulk of his estate to the city of Southampton to preserve his house as a museum and to promote the study of his favourite subjects: natural history, astronomy, antiquities, classics, and oriental literature.<br>
<br>In 1846 Hartley returned to Calais where his health continued to deteriorate. He died there on 24 May 1850 of cardiac ailments and complications of a stricture of the urinary tract which had afflicted him since his youth. He was buried in London in a vault in New Bunhill Fields, a burial-ground for dissenters.<br>
<br>Hartley's biographer describes him as an eighteenth-century scholar and dilettante, alienated by the commercial and industrial expansion of the nineteenth century  (Anderson, 202). His existence was certainly unhappy and would have remained obscure were it not for the bequest to Southampton. The estate was valued at approximately &pound;110,000. The will was contested in chancery, principally by Celia Hartley's daughter, Sarah. The claimants eventually accepted a settlement but the sum remaining to the corporation of Southampton was less than half the original amount.<br>
<br>After much debate, the city used the bequest to establish the Hartley Institution (1862) which combined a museum, library, and venue for public lectures. The institution evolved in a pattern familiar in the nineteenth century, becoming Hartley College (1896), Hartley University College (1902), University College of Southampton (1914), and the University of Southampton (1952). Notwithstanding the intentions of his bequest, Hartley's house was demolished and, except in his association with the university, Hartley has been largely forgotten, even in his native Southampton.<br>
