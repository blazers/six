<span class="headword">Sykes, Sir  Tatton</span>, fourth baronet  (1772&#150;1863), <span class="occ">landowner and racehorse breeder</span>, was born at Wheldrake, near York, on 22 August 1772, the second son of Sir Christopher Sykes, second baronet (1749&#150;1801), MP for Beverley, and his wife, Elizabeth Tatton (<i>d</i>. 1803). He was educated at Bishopthorpe, at Westminster School, and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was briefly in residence but did not take a degree. He was articled to Atkinson and Farrar, solicitors, of Lincoln's Inn Fields. While in London, he walked to Epsom to see the 1791 Derby, and he rode down to see the race the following year, but thereafter he never visited Epsom again. At this time he became an expert boxer, learning the sport from Gentleman Jackson and Jim Belcher.<br>
<br>Sykes worked for a bank in Hull for a short time, but in 1803 began sheep farming and breeding by purchasing ten pure Bakewells, and driving them on foot from Lincoln to his home at Barton, near Malton, Yorkshire. This was the start of a lifelong interest, and until nearly eighty he rode each year to sales of stock in the midlands. In 1861 he held his own fifty-eighth and last annual sale of sheep. It was said that he loved a good sheep almost, if not quite, as well as a good horse.<br>
<br>Sykes married on 19 June 1822 Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1861), second daughter of Sir William Foulis, bt. She was a cousin of his nephew Mark Foulis, and Sykes first suggested that the two cousins marry. When Mark Foulis rejected the idea Sykes replied &#145;If that is the case there is nothing for it but for me to wed&#146;  (Fairfax-Blakeborough, 67&#150;8) and immediately proposed to her himself. They had two sons and six daughters. In the year after his marriage Sykes succeeded to the baronetcy following the death of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26869/', "Sir Mark Masterman Sykes")</script>, on 16 February 1823, and moved to Sledmere, near Malton. Unlike his brother, he did not have parliamentary ambitions, and instead devoted his time to agriculture. He was keen on introducing new farming methods. His use of bone manure to enrich the land with phosphates enabled sheep to be fed and corn to be grown on previously infertile land and raised the agricultural value of his estates in the Wolds. He was also a master of foxhounds for forty years, hunting the country from Coxwold to Spurn Head in the East Riding.<br>
<br>Sir Tatton was one of the largest breeders of bloodstock of his day, and at his death his stud numbered around 300 thoroughbreds. Such a number reveals that the emphasis was on quantity rather than quality, and it is remarkable that he never bred the winner of the Derby or St Leger, his best horses being Grey Momus, third in the Derby of 1837, and Black Tommy, second in 1857. He never sold any of his fillies and so lost the chance of seeing any of them compete in the fillies' classics.<br>
<br>Sir Tatton's connection with the turf as an owner was not extensive. The first horse he ran was Telemachus, at Middleton in 1803. For over twenty years after this he occasionally kept horses in training at Malton, and mainly rode them himself in races for gentleman riders. His last victory on one of his own horses was in 1829, when he won the Welham cup at Malton on All Heart and No Peel. He was a well-known patron of Doncaster races and saw seventy-seven runnings of the St Leger; in 1846 he had the honour of leading in the winner of the St Leger, which had been named Sir Tatton Sykes after him. During his visits to Doncaster he lodged, for forty years, with a cow-keeper whom he had once met by accident and who had offered him hospitality when he was unable to find lodgings in the town. This was typical of a man who made no distinction of classes; farmers, dealers, and stone breakers were welcome to his hospitality at Sledmere, when he would often serve them the famous Sledmere ale himself, and he treated poachers leniently, thereby preserving his own game. Sir Tatton died of pneumonia at Sledmere on 21 March 1863, and was buried there on 27 March. Three thousand people were present, and, as a mark of respect, there was no fox-hunting in Yorkshire that day. A memorial tower 120 feet high was erected at Garton Hill, near Sledmere, by public subscription. Like other sporting squires, he became a popular figure well beyond his native county and almost revered within it. He was mentioned in the sporting novels of Robert Smith Surtees, and was famous for his adherence to the fashions of the Regency. His family, however, knew him as a brutal figure, who ruled over them &#145;with the vicious rage of a stone-age tyrant&#146;  (Sykes, &#145;Behind the tablet&#146;, 13).<br>
<br>The eccentricities of his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_57018"></a><span class="headword">Sir Tatton Sykes</span>, fifth baronet  (1826&#150;1913)<span class="occ"></span>, may be attributed to his barbaric upbringing. He was born on 13 March 1826, and on his father's death inherited both the baronetcy and the largest estate (some 34,000 acres) in the East Riding of Yorkshire. His wealth increased as he raised rents during the prosperity of the 1870s, but when depression took hold in the agricultural sector, he became a hated figure among his tenant farmers and received death threats. He re-established the Sledmere stud, which had been dispersed on his father's death. He was a more successful breeder than his father, and produced two Derby winners, Doncaster (1873) and Spearmint (1906), and Mimi, winner of the One Thousand Guineas and the Oaks in 1891.<br>
<br>Sykes's other great interest was church-building and restoration: he reputedly spent &pound;1.5 million in east Yorkshire on this object during his lifetime. In his early life, to escape his tyrannical father, he travelled widely in the Orient, studying ecclesiastical architecture. Unlike his father, who had treated church-building as an aspect of estate management, he was deeply interested in high Anglican ecclesiology, and employed the Gothic revivalists G. E. Street and (later) Temple Moore to carry out his projects.<br>
<br>A shy and reserved figure, Sykes lived alone in Sledmere for over a decade before his marriage on 3 August 1874 to (Christina Anne) Jessica (<i>c</i>.1856&#150;1912), daughter of George Augustus Cavendish-Bentinck MP. She was some thirty years her husband's junior and the marriage, which produced only one child, was not a happy one. Lady Sykes, who was received into the Roman Catholic church in 1882, became increasingly estranged from her husband, who, it was alleged, failed to pay her marriage settlement. Their affairs, and her debts, were the subject of a legal dispute (<i>Sykes v. Sykes</i>) in 1897, when a judge described Sir Tatton as &#145;an obstinate and extremely whimsical old gentleman&#146;  (Sykes, &#145;Sir Tatton Sykes&#146;, 71). She subsequently published novels and an eyewitness account of the South African War, following a visit there in 1900.<br>
<br>The second Sir Tatton Sykes's oddities were marked by his belief that the body should be kept at a constant temperature. To achieve this, he would wear six overcoats or two pairs of trousers, discarding layers as necessary. Obsessive about diet, he had milk puddings specially prepared for him by his personal cook wherever he went. He hated seeing flowers in his farm and cottage gardens, believing they should be used for growing potatoes or other vegetables, and so strongly did he insist on his views that traditional country gardens largely disappeared from the Sledmere estate. He also disliked cottagers using their front doors, perhaps because he hated to see women gossiping or children playing in the street, and as a result he built estate houses without front doors. A couple of years before his death he suffered the destruction by fire of his home, Sledmere House, on 23 May 1911. Sykes died of pneumonia in the Hotel Metropole, Northumberland Avenue, London on 4 May 1913 and was buried at Sledmere. He was succeeded by his only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36394/', "Sir Mark Sykes, sixth baronet")</script>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65292"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Sykes</span>  (1831&#150;1898)<span class="occ"></span>, younger brother of the second Sir Tatton Sykes, reacted to his father's bullying by joining the &#145;swells&#146; of London society in the 1850s. He was born at Sledmere on 10 January 1831, and was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1848 but left without graduating. Never marrying, he became a man of fashion (and a snob), and was a connoisseur of books, china, and furniture. From 1865 to 1868 he was Conservative MP for Beverley, and represented the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1868 to 1885, and the Buckrose constituency of the East Riding from 1886 to 1892. During his long parliamentary career he made only six speeches. His one intervention of note was his 1869 bill for the preservation of seabirds (which were being slaughtered by shooters off the east coast); this earned him the sobriquet the Gull's Friend.<br>
<br>Christopher Sykes fell in with the circle of the prince of Wales (the future Edward VII), whom he entertained lavishly at his seat at Brantingham Thorpe, Brough, Yorkshire, when they visited the Doncaster races, and at his London home, 11 Hill Street, Berkeley Square. He was one of the founders of the Marlborough club, promoted by the prince. Disraeli portrayed him in <span class="italic">Lothair</span> as Mr Brauncepath, the young man who knew the art of giving dinners supremely well. But the prince exploited his slavish loyalty, and subjected his courtier to a string of humiliations; on one occasion he poured a glass of brandy over his head at a dinner, to which Sykes responded, &#145;As your royal highness pleases&#146;  (Sykes, &#145;Behind the tablet&#146;, 28). He was financially ruined by the prince's extravagance, and though his bankruptcy was narrowly averted in the early 1890s, he lost his country estate and his home in Berkeley Square. Sykes died at home (2 Chesterfield Street, Mayfair, London) on 15 December 1898 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. The prince erected a tablet to his memory in Westminster Abbey. His life was the subject of a poignant memoir by his great-nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39845/', "Christopher Hugh Sykes")</script>.<br>
