<span class="headword">Fielding,  (Anthony Vandyke) Copley</span>  (1787&#150;1855), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, the third and best-known of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9403/', "Nathan Theodore Fielding (1746/7&#150;1819)")</script> and Elizabeth (Betty) Baker or Barker (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1806/7), was born near Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire, on 22 November 1787. Although he is said to have been named after his father's friend the history painter John Singleton Copley, there is no obvious evidence for such a friendship at that time, and Copley, the name by which he was generally known, was also the name of the neighbouring hamlet to Sowerby. Fielding's father was a peripatetic portrait and landscape painter, and the family moved to Acton, where Copley attended a school. He and his brother Frederick [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/72903">Fielding,  Felix Ferdinand Frederick Raffael</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/9404">Fielding,  Newton Smith Limbird</a>] were later employed as engrossing clerks in the enrolment office of the court of chancery. About 1804, after periods at Durham and London, the Fieldings settled in the Lake District, first at Ambleside, where a neighbour at Troutbeck was the landscape painter Julius Caesar Ibbetson, and later at Keswick. By this time Nathan Fielding was teaching his children to paint by copying his own landscapes. The Fieldings were also noted for practical jokes, as when they diverted a picturesque waterfall just before the arrival of a party of tourists. Mrs Fielding died about 1806, and after a stay in Manchester Copley went to Liverpool with his father in 1807.<br>
<br>The following year Fielding toured north Wales and visited London, where he settled in 1809, lodging in Wells Street. According to Cornelius Varley he &#145;came to town with indifferent drawings, and received most free instruction and advice as a friend&#146;  (Royal Watercolour Society archives, J.97) from the ever-generous John Varley, living near by in Broad Street, Golden Square. This understates Fielding's talent, and by January 1810 he had absorbed enough to be elected associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. That summer he visited his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9407/', "Theodore Fielding")</script> at Penrith and Frederick at Carlisle, and toured the borders, while in 1811 he revisited Liverpool and north Wales. Although he became the most eminent of the brothers, his career was the least eventful, and despite family connections with Paris (his brothers established an atelier in the place Dauphine), he never ventured to the continent. This may have been due to the poor health of his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1856), daughter of Zachariah Gisborne of Ramsgate and sister of John Varley's wife, and also the illness of their first daughter. The couple married on 19 December 1813 at St Pancras parish church, and in 1815 they took Mrs Siddons's old house in Judge's Walk, Hampstead, but two years later the doctors decreed that sea air was necessary for their daughter, and they settled at Sandgate. Later they moved to Brighton, and finally to Worthing. Mrs Fielding is described by the historian of the Old Watercolour Society, J. L. Roget, as &#145;a lady whose high principles, pious feeling, and sound judgement, with which were united a refined taste and some literary acquirements, enabled her to become a main support to her husband during the rest of his life&#146;  (Roget, 1.328). Gisborne's third daughter, Emma, married Muzio Clementi (1752&#150;1832), the pianist and composer admired by Beethoven but not Mozart. In 1821 Fielding's sister Cleobulina Amelia married Henry Willey Reveley (<i>d</i>. 1875), son of Willey Reveley the architect (1760&#150;1799), whose widow Maria (the friend of Shelley) had married Susannah's brother John. As she reported to Mary Shelley, Maria Gisborne was not impressed by artistic London:<blockquote>since we have been in England it has never been our fate to pass an agreeable evening &hellip; Clementi is at least a century behind hand; the Fieldings are good, but nothing can be less intellectual or more insipid; Varley is mad; Cristall quaint and quizzical &hellip; (letter of 17 May 1822, <span class="italic">The Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span>, ed. B.T. Bennett, 1980&#150;88, 86)</blockquote>Fielding was elected a full member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1811, serving as treasurer in 1813 and secretary on several occasions thereafter. In 1817 he bought the house at 26 Newman Street which was to be the London base of the family business for the next thirty years. At various times the brothers Theodore, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9406/', "Thales Fielding")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9404/', "Newton Fielding")</script> taught private pupils and apprentices there, including William Callow and Charles Bentley. John Ruskin took lessons from Copley, commenting, &#145;I know not whether Papa or I most enjoyed the six hours in Newman Street, my father's intense delight in Fielding's work making it a real pleasure to the painter that he should stay chatting while I had my lesson&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 35.214); despite this, Fielding did manage to teach his pupil. Fielding produced occasional oil paintings, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution, but almost all his exhibited watercolours were shown at the Society of Painters in Water Colours, 1748 in all. A later commentator argued that &#145;probably no member of the Society was ever held in greater affection and respect by his colleagues&#146;  (Smith, 14), and Fielding's life was largely devoted to the society, especially after his election as deputy president in 1823 and president in 1831. He was fitted for the position, his colleagues felt, &#145;not only by his genial disposition and painstaking habits, but by his courtly manners and a more than ordinary share of social tact&#146;  (Roget, 2.79).<br>
<br>Fielding's works, whether northern or Welsh mountain and moorland views, marine subjects or studies of the South Downs and cliffs, were immensely popular with collectors and the public, although critics then and subsequently have usually qualified their praise. Roget quoted a gibe that Fielding &#145;painted but one sea, one moor, one down, one lake, one misty gleam&#146;  (Roget, 2.77) and in the 1960s Hardie noted that &#145;in after years his art became facile, dextrous, but not always sincere&#146;  (Hardie, 225). Even Ruskin, a lifelong admirer, had reservations:<blockquote>In his down scenes and moorland showers he produced some of the most perfect and faultless passages of mist and rain cloud which art has ever seen &hellip; Had he painted five rather than five hundred such, and gone on to other sources of beauty, he might, there can be little doubt, have been one of our greatest artists. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.245)</blockquote>Fielding's prolific output was noted by David Cox, who referring to the Old Watercolour Society's exhibition in a letter of 1846 sounded a slightly sour note: &#145;I have at present sold only two 10gn drawings &hellip; Fielding has sent more than 40 drawings, some large, and a great number appear to be sold&#146;  (Hall, 157&#150;8). In his <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span> Ruskin observed a kinship to Turner's method of &#145;driving the eye into the distance by the use of brown moorland foregrounds&#146; created with &#145;wet broad sweeps of the brush&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.185). A later commentator noted: &#145;His mannerisms include the dragging of the brush to give an idea of distance and the effect of sunlight through mist, which cleverly disguises the lack of more original ideas&#146;  (Mallalieu, <span class="italic">Watercolour artists</span>).<br>
<br>It should not be forgotten, however, that although Fielding's work became formulaic, when new those formulae had a powerful effect. In the 1824 English salon which was the sensation of the Paris art world, Fielding shone along with Constable and Richard Parkes Bonington. For the artist Paul Huet, his exhibits were full of poetry, but they also conveyed the impression of truth  (<span class="italic">Paul Huet</span>, 95), while the critic Auguste Jal feared that the merits of Thales and Copley Fielding would so turn the heads of public and dealers that &#145;we shall be inundated with stupid imitations&#146;  (Jal, 417&#150;18). In fact, Fielding's strengths&#151;tact, and the arts of pleasing&#151;were also his weaknesses. Ruskin reminisced of visits to the Old Watercolour Society's exhibitions to discuss:<blockquote>the unimposing merits of the favourites, from whose pencils we knew precisely what to expect, and by whom we were never either disappointed or surprised. Copley Fielding used to paint fishing boats for us, in a fresh breeze, &#145;Off Dover,&#146; &#145;Off Ramsgate,&#146; &#145;Off the Needles&#146;&#151;off everywhere on the South Coast where anyone had been last autumn, but we were always pleasantly within sight of land, and never saw so much as a gun fired in distress. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.389)</blockquote>Later Hardie commented that Fielding was a good example of those painters who supplied what their patrons demanded but in whose &#145;early work and unexhibited sketches made for their own satisfaction &hellip; we find true art and genuine emotion instead of mechanical formula&#146;  (Hardie, 2.223&#150;8).<br>
<br>Fielding's daughter Susanna Henrietta died in 1847, and he himself on 3 March 1855, at his home, 5 Park Crescent, Worthing, of a disease of the bladder; he was buried in Hove, probably on 10 March. His wife followed on 15 December 1856, and their surviving daughter, Emma, on 12 January 1867. There are examples of his work in most major British public collections.<br>
