</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deutsch,  Andr&eacute;</span>  (1917&#150;2000), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 15 November 1917 in Budapest, Hungary, the only child of Bruno Deutsch, dental surgeon, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Havas. His father was Jewish and his mother partly so. Deutsch was educated at various schools in Budapest, Vienna, and Z&uuml;rich; the atmosphere at home was Anglophile and he learned to speak English at an early age. In 1939 when he was twenty-two he went to London aiming to become a student at the London School of Economics. But with the outbreak of war, funding from his parents, who remained in Hungary, ceased and he was forced to take a job at the Dorchester Hotel.<br>
<br>As a Hungarian citizen Deutsch was rounded up under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span> and interned on the Isle of Man. He was soon released, however, and returned to the wartime London of the blitz. He became a fire-watcher and joined the Home Guard. An introduction from a fellow internee to John Roberts, the volatile Welsh managing director of the publishers Nicholson and Watson, resulted in Deutsch's joining its staff as sales representative and soon after becoming sales manager. He acquired a thorough grounding in all aspects of the book trade and became convinced that publishing was his vocation.<br>
<br>Deutsch belonged to a circle of gifted refugees from Europe. He was a friend of George Weidenfeld who, exiled from his native Vienna, was then working for the BBC with plans to publish <span class="italic">Contact</span>, a high-level miscellany that would serve as a forum for the cultural and political life of post-war Britain. Thanks to Deutsch this compilation, which ran for several numbers, appeared under the imprint of Nicholson and Watson. As the war in Europe drew to an end Deutsch decided it was the time to found his own publishing company. With an initial capital of only &pound;3000, the firm Allan Wingate, a name he conjured out of the air, was born. It was saved many times from bankruptcy by the irrepressible buoyancy of its founder and his knack of finding people prepared to inject fresh capital into the company in exchange for directorships.<br>
<br>Deutsch had a nose for the kind of book that, in journalistic parlance, is called a &#145;scoop&#146;. It led him to go to Turkey after the Second World War in pursuit of the spy Elyesa Bazna (Cicero), valet at the British embassy, who had sold allied secrets to the Germans. This led to two books Deutsch published at an interval of ten years: <span class="italic">Operation Cicero</span> by Bazna's German contact L. C. Moyzich, and a later one by Bazna himself, <span class="italic">I was Cicero</span>. While on the trail of Cicero, Deutsch met Franz von Papen, Germany's wartime ambassador in Turkey. Deutsch quickly realized that here was an even bigger potential catch for his list. He persuaded von Papen to write a volume of memoirs to be published by Wingate. Unfortunately by 1951 when these were written the company was in total disarray. Deutsch lost control to his fellow directors and had to resign.<br>
<br>Deutsch soon set about forming a new publishing company, Andr&eacute; Deutsch Ltd. He persuaded Diana Athill (<i>b</i>. 1917), who had been with him at his former firm since its outset in 1945, to join it. Athill, an Oxford English literature graduate, became Deutsch's business partner for the rest of their publishing careers. Her cool sound judgement and skill as an editor were the perfect complement to Deutsch's initiative and flair. At the start for a short time they became lovers, or, as Athill explains in her entertaining memoir <span class="italic">Stet: an Editor's Life</span> (2000), &#145;we ate an omelette and went to bed together, without&#151;as I remember it&#151;much excitement on either side&#146;. Excitement often came to them but in a different form, as colleagues in the two publishing houses that Deutsch founded. Deutsch exploited Athill, but she put up with it because she loved her work. &#145;So while it is true that Andr&eacute; took advantage of my nature&#146;, she wrote, &#145;in getting me cheap and having to bother so little about my feelings, it cannot be said that <i>in relation to the job</i> he did any violence to those feelings&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Deutsch regarded the rights to the von Papen book as his and planned to publish it. His former director-colleagues took a different view of the matter and made an approach to the author to keep the book on the Wingate list. A puzzled von Papen telephoned Deutsch to find out what was going on and after talking to him at some length affirmed his loyalty to Deutsch and his right to be the publisher of the book. Deutsch then sold the serialization rights to <span class="italic">The People</span>, the Sunday newspaper, for &pound;30,000. The book was successfully published by Deutsch's new company in 1952 and was the means of its early survival.<br>
<br>In seeking authors Deutsch made an annual trip to the USA where he signed up Philip Roth and John Updike before either was known in Britain. Back home on his expanding fiction list he published Roy Fuller, the wartime poet turned novelist; Brian Moore, the Belfast writer whose first novel, <span class="italic">Judith Hearne</span>, appeared in 1955; and Wolf Mankowitz, whose novella about the antique business <span class="italic">Make me an Offer</span> struck a refreshingly new note of Anglo-Jewish humour. Even more successful in the comic field was a short book, <span class="italic">How to be an Alien</span>, by Deutsch's fellow Hungarian George Mikes, destined to remain in print for many years. Illustrations for it by the artist Nicolas Bentley resulted in Bentley's becoming a working director of the company.<br>
<br>A meeting in London between Athill and V. S. Naipaul led to the publication of <span class="italic">The Mystic Masseur</span> (1957) and many of Deutsch's subsequent books. His appreciation of Athill as an editor was shared by many of the firm's authors. The Trinidad historian and politician Eric Williams was another Caribbean writer published by Deutsch. The discovery of Jean Rhys's prequel to Charlotte Bront&euml;'s <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span>, <span class="italic">Wide Sargasso Sea</span> (1966), set in Dominica (where the author was born) and Jamaica heralded a revival of interest in a hitherto unjustly neglected writer. In 1962 Deutsch founded the African Universities Press in Lagos, Nigeria, and in 1964 the East Africa Publishing House, Nairobi, Kenya. During the 1970s his friendship with Harold Evans, the editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, resulted in Deutsch publishing the work of the paper's Insight team, investigative journalism in book form. Deutsch's love of travel made him an ideal ambassador for his profession. He would head missions promoting British publishing in central Europe or throughout the Indian subcontinent.<br>
<br>At sixty-five Deutsch had no thought of retirement but he realized, albeit reluctantly, that the company could not continue solely under his leadership for ever. In 1984 he received an approach from T. G. (Tom) Rosenthal (<i>b</i>. 1935), the former chairman of William Heinemann Ltd, to take over Andr&eacute; Deutsch Ltd. Somewhat unwisely Deutsch tried to conclude a deal with Rosenthal whereby he would still retain a large measure of control of the company. After protracted negotiations conducted for Deutsch by Lord Goodman, Rosenthal acquired 50.1 per cent of the company, with the two men as joint chairmen and joint managing directors. An unhappy time ensued for Deutsch who was reluctant to cede any form of authority to the younger man. He lingered on with an office and various titles until he was seventy-two, when in considerable bitterness he retired completely from active involvement in the company. In 1989 he was awarded the CBE for his contribution to publishing. In 1991 he became a director of Libra, an imprint in his native Budapest.<br>
<br>Deutsch was a popular member of the Garrick Club and had a wide circle of friends who enjoyed his lively talk with its insights into politics and people uttered in what always remained a distinctly Hungarian accent. His boyish good looks never deserted him even in old age. Until he became crippled by the debilitating illness Crohn's disease, he was a keen skier, going to Davos every year.<br>
<br>On one of these holidays when he was still young Deutsch met Gwen, an English woman ten years his senior and the wife of Francis Winham. There was instant rapport; the two of them formed an attachment that proved lifelong. Gwen survived the death of her husband by many years but she and Deutsch never married and always had separate residences. It was, however, recognized among their circle that they were a devoted couple. Deutsch died of heart failure at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 11 April 2000 aged eighty-two and was cremated.<br>
