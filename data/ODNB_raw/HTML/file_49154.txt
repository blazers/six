<span class="headword">Pigott <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kemp]</span>,  (Emily) Jessie</span>  (1851&#150;1900), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, born on 8 August 1851 at 43 Tavistock Square, London, was the daughter of George Tawke Kemp JP, a flannel manufacturer, and Emily Lydia Kemp, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelsall, later of Beechwood, Manchester Road, Rochdale. The family was well off, Baptist, and heavily imbued with missionary zeal. In 1877, after accompanying her father to Egypt, Jessie Kemp went on to become a missionary in Allahabad and Delhi, working with the Baptist Missionary Society. Ill health forced her to return to Britain in 1879, and she was refused medical permission to return to India. However, a cousin, Harold Schofield, had opened a medical mission in Taiyuan, Shansi province, China, under the aegis of the China Inland Mission (CIM), and suggested she join him. With her sister, Florence, she travelled to China, and in early 1883 she arrived in Taiyuan, where she became an associate of the CIM.<br>
<br>In China, Jessie Kemp engaged in evangelistic work but she also undertook medical duties, notably&#151;and as an amateur&#151;operating on cataracts. There, too, she met another CIM missionary, Thomas Wellesley Pigott (1847&#150;1900), of Ryevale, co. Kildare, Ireland, whom she married in Peking (Beijing) on 16 July 1883. In order for Pigott to recover from the effects of an assault, the couple spent from May 1885 until March 1888 in Britain, where Jessie studied treatments of the eyes, and gave birth to their only child, William Wellesley, on 4 August 1887.<br>
<br>The Pigotts resigned their connections with the CIM on 4 June 1890, after disputes over the society's rules, its &#145;Principles and practice&#146;. The rapidly growing mission was still under the &#145;godly leadership&#146; of J. Hudson Taylor, but Thomas Pigott wanted democratic elections, a committee structure, and greater autonomy in the Shansi district, of which he had recently become CIM superintendent. The society was fractious at the best of times, but the couple were wealthy and confidently able both to assert themselves and then to support themselves independently of the mission in their quest for autonomy of action.<br>
<br>After a spell in Britain&#151;in part because of Jessie Pigott's health, but also because they needed to establish a firm domestic base of support for their efforts&#151;the couple returned to China in April 1891 and established their own non-denominational mission at Showyang (Shouyang), east of Taiyuan, in 1892. The mission was not lacking in financial security and Pigott continued her medical work; by 1900 the station had eleven personnel and another branch in Taiyuan. However, in May and June 1900, the anti-foreign Boxer movement began to threaten foreigners in Shansi. On 29 June the Showyang magistrate withdrew protection from the small foreign community and the Pigotts fled to a Christian village outside the town. As the situation in the countryside grew more unstable they returned, and surrendered themselves to his custody. On 6 July they were transported to Taiyuan, and on 9 July Jessie, Thomas, and William Pigott were among the forty-four missionaries and their families publicly beheaded in the presence of the provincial governor, Yuxian.<br>
<br>Jessie Pigott's persistence&#151;a family trait: her mother had taken over the running of the family mills after George Kemp's death&#151;and her husband's wealth meant that their missionary careers were atypical. In Showyang they had a governess and a tutor for their son, both from Britain. Nevertheless, their wealth ultimately did little to counteract her loneliness and the pain of separation from her family in Rochdale, to which she was very attached. Ill health, isolation, and an early death were, moreover, fairly typical rewards for missionaries in nineteenth-century China. In this Jessie Pigott was no exception.<br>
