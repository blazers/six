</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cleveland,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 20 June 1613 at Loughborough, the son of Thomas Cleveland (<i>d</i>. 1652) and Elizabeth Hebbe (<i>d</i>. 1649). He was the second of their eleven children, not all of whom survived, and their eldest son. Thomas Cleveland was then assistant to the rector of the parish church as well as usher at Burton's Grammar School. In 1621, however, he became vicar of Hinckley.<br>
<br>Cleveland's education continued with his admission to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 4 September 1627. He was enrolled as a lesser pensioner and his fees were therefore &pound;50 a year, a substantial sum in those days and one indicating that his family had become financially comfortable since the time when his father had been trying to glean an adequate income from two jobs. John's tutor at Christ's was William Siddall, who stood high in seniority&#151;perhaps second&#151;among the fellows.<br>
<br>The years at Cambridge were distinctly productive for Cleveland with regard to both academic achievement and the writing of poems. In September 1629 he was selected to deliver the Latin speech of welcome to the earl of Holland, who was chancellor of the university. The earl was accompanied by the French ambassador. Later, though perhaps while he was still an undergraduate, John acted as &#145;father&#146; (that is, master of ceremonies) at the Cambridge revels. If his having been selected to make the Latin speech to the university chancellor suggests the esteem accorded his Latinity and his rhetorical skills, his appointment as father of the revels implies that he was not merely well liked by students and fellows but also esteemed for his wit. Aubrey described him as &#145;a comely plump man, good curled haire, darke browne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.174&#150;5).<br>
<br>In any event, although John's role as father may not strictly count as one of his academic achievements, there were certainly others. He graduated BA early in 1632, was elected to the Hebblethwaite fellowship at St John's College in 1634, and proceeded MA in 1635. Two of the students under his guidance were Samuel Drake and John Lake; they compiled the 1677 edition of his works. Anthony Wood's claim that John proceeded MA from Oxford as well as from Cambridge remains unsubstantiated. It should be added that, although fellows of St John's College were obliged to take holy orders within six years of their elections, John did not. He was admitted to the law line in 1640. Between 1635 and 1637 he became rhetoric reader. His duties involved writing orations and also letters on behalf of St John's, for example to the archbishop of Canterbury and to Lord Herbert of Cherbury. In 1636 he delivered an address to Charles Lewis, son of Frederick, the elector palatine, and of King Charles's sister. In March 1642 he addressed the king himself. The king apparently liked the speech and ordered that a copy be sent him after his departure that evening from the university. Cleveland also contributed verses to two university miscellanies. One of these was an elegy for the death of Edward King, and was published in the same volume as fellow Christ's man John Milton's &#145;Lycidas&#146; (<span class="italic">Juxta Edouardo King</span>, 1638). It is among the earliest of Cleveland's datable poems, but reveals qualities to be seen throughout his verse as a whole. Writing in the tradition of the &#145;literature of tears&#146; (primarily though not solely a religious literary tradition in seventeenth-century English verse), Cleveland portrays his grief as being a virtual re-enactment of King's death.<blockquote>
<div>My tears will keep no channells, know no laws<br>
</div>
<div>To guide their streams; but like the waves, their cause,<br>
</div>
<div>Run with disturbance, till they swallow me<br>
</div>
<div>As a description of his miserie.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Juxta Edouardo King</span>, ll. 13&#150;16)</blockquote>Such hyperbole and catachresis (an extravagant metaphor using words in an alien or unusual way) recur in many of Cleveland's poems. Sometimes he uses the figures to indicate intense anger, as in his political poems; sometimes to indicate wonder in celebration of the ineffable, as in poems extolling the king; sometimes, as in various erotic poems, he uses them for comic effect. The elegy also shows John Donne's influence on Cleveland: notably in the tendency to paradox and epigram.<br>
<br>It has been argued that many of Cleveland's amatory and non-political poems were written while he was still at university&#151;June 1642 is the last sure date that marks his presence there. They show him fully engaged in the social and political upheavals of the times, with mocking denunciation of the king's enemies running through the verses. In 1640 Cleveland opposed Oliver Cromwell's campaign for election to the Long Parliament. As Samuel Drake and John Lake later described the event:<blockquote>When <i>Oliver</i> was in Election to be Burgess for the Town of <i>Cambridge</i>, as [Cleveland] engaged all his Friends and Interests to oppose it, so when it was passed, he said with much passionate Zeal, That single Vote had ruined both Church and Kingdom. (Drake and Lake, foreword, sig. Ab<i>v</i>)</blockquote>More vigorous political action on Cleveland's part would follow, and it is as political satirist that he is chiefly famous. In &#145;Upon the Kings Return from Scotland&#146;, for example, he represents Charles I as a godlike figure, a sun king who is also the soul of the state (ll. 1&#150;8), and the guarantor of both its peace and of its established religion (ll. 35&#150;40). &#145;To P. Rupert&#146;, in harmony with that poem, portrays the prince as mysteriously the embodiment of past, present, and future heroic virtue (ll. 55&#150;70), standing between the state and those who would confound it (ll. 155&#150;72). Drawing upon the resources of royalist polemic and adding to them, the poems suggest that law and religion, reason and virtue are centred on the monarchy. The enemies of the crown are presented as men who would undo the law, who promote a parody of true religion, and who are (often wilfully) self-deluding creatures driven by unreason and expediency. They are the instigators of anarchy, who would turn the world upside down and so erase all decorum. In &#145;A Dialogue between two Zealots, upon the &amp;c. in the Oath&#146;, for example, two puritan divines construct a crazy, self-interested, apocalyptic fantasy around the ampersand in the so-called etcetera oath of 1640 legitimizing the new ecclesiastical canons. Another satire, &#145;Smectymnuus, or, The Club-Divines&#146;, continues Cleveland's portrait of the puritan grotesque in its depiction of the five ministers who under that name published anti-episcopal pamphlets in 1641.<br>
<br>Some time after June 1642 Cleveland left Cambridge, which was a difficult place for an outspoken royalist to live, as violent hostilities had begun between parliamentary supporters in the town and members of the university. He joined the king at his headquarters, established at Oxford in November. There John wrote &#145;The Rebell Scot&#146; and <span class="italic">The Character of a London-Diurnall</span>. The former, a satirical poem against the Scots, is now perhaps the best-known poem in the Cleveland canon; certainly it is the most famous of his verse satires. The speaker of the satire derides the Scots as being the bestial inhabitants of a wilderness whose wretched poverty drives them abroad as mercenaries. Early in the poem the speaker is quick to suggest the unnaturalness of a Scottish threat to England and his fury at such a prospect (ll. 3&#150;7). He thereafter says:<blockquote>
<div>Nature her selfe doth Scotch-men beasts confesse,<br>
</div>
<div>Making their Countrey such a wildernesse:<br>
</div>
<div>A Land that brings in question and suspense<br>
</div>
<div>Gods omnipresence, but that CHARLES came thence:<br>
</div>
<div>But that <i>Montrose</i> and <i>Crawfords</i> loyall Band<br>
</div>
<div>Atton'd their sins, and christ'ned halfe the Land.<br>
</div> (ll. 47&#150;52)</blockquote>The Scots are pictured as creatures whom nature has excluded from civil life (elsewhere in the poem they are portrayed as having no sense of the common weal; see ll. 63&#150;80). They and their country have been definitely brought into the divine order of things only because of the English monarch's recent visit to Scotland and the redemptive, military power of his representatives. <span class="italic">The Character of a London-Diurnall</span>, a prose satire ridiculing the London newsbooks, was published anonymously early in 1645. The London newsbooks reported lies, Cleveland's speaker declared, not news, and inflated their accounts of parliamentary victories. &#145;A Diurnal is a puny Chronical&#146;, Cleveland wrote,<blockquote>scarce Pin-feather'd with the wings of Time. It is History in Snippets: The English <span class="roman">Iliads</span> in a Nutshel: The Apochryphal Parliament's <span class="roman">Book of Maccabees</span> in single sheets. (J. Cleveland, <span class="italic">The Character of a London-Diurnall</span>, 1645, 108)</blockquote>The satire also contains a vigorous caricature of Cromwell. The publication of the pamphlet was noted by Marchamont Nedham in <span class="italic">Mercurius Britannicus</span> on 10 February, though Nedham waited until the following week to print his attack. Many other newsbooks printed their responses, and three pamphlets were published attacking <span class="italic">The Character</span> in three weeks. A later &#145;character&#146; continued the attack. With Nedham's <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> (1650) in his sights, Cleveland suggested: &#145;It is time that we had our State-scold to the Ducking-stool&#146;  (quoted in J. Raymond, <span class="italic">The Invention of the Newspaper</span>, 1996, 219).<br>
<br>From approximately spring 1645 to that of the following year Cleveland served as judge advocate with the royal garrison at Newark. His appointment was noticed by the opposite faction in the <span class="italic">Kingdome's Weekly Intelligencer</span>:<blockquote>But to speak something of our friend Cleveland, that grand malignant of Cambridge, we hear that now he is at Newark, where he hath the title of advocate put upon him. His office and employment is to gather all college rents within the power of the king's forces in those parts, which he distributes to such as are turned out of their fellowships at Cambridge for their malignancy. (<span class="italic">Kingdome's Weekly Intelligencer</span>, no. 101, 27 May 1645, 811)</blockquote>The king left Newark just before the city was besieged by the Scots in November 1645 and it was Cleveland who wrote in refusal of a demand for the city's surrender. However, on 5 May 1646 the king surrendered himself to the Scots at Southwell, not far from Newark. The Scots' demand for the city's surrender was agreed to by the king and surrender was made on 6 May. There seems little evidence to support a story that, after the surrender, Cleveland was tried and disdainfully dismissed by David Leslie, commander of the Scottish forces.<br>
<br>Following the popularity of <span class="italic">The Character of a London-Diurnall</span> (<span class="italic">ESTC</span> notes four variants of the 1645 edition), Cleveland published <span class="italic">The Character of a London-Diurnall: with Several Select Poems</span> (1647). This was the first time that many of the poems had been published, and it shows how Cleveland's political satires helped to secure his place in popular taste. Eight different variants of this edition exist from 1647. In the same year another volume of mixed prose and poetry was published, <span class="italic">The Character of a Moderate Intelligencer with Some Select Poems</span>. Cleveland's works proved tremendously successful. <span class="italic">Poems by J. C. with Additions</span>, first published in 1651, was reprinted in 1653, 1654, 1656, 1657, 1659, 1661, 1662, 1665, and 1669. Other volumes of his poetry and prose were published in 1658, 1659, 1677, and 1687. Yet another indication of his popularity is the many works not by Cleveland that were published under his name by booksellers keen to exploit his fame.<br>
<br>Not much seems to be known about what happened to Cleveland after the war. There has been a reasonable assumption that, in Berdan's words, &#145;[l]ike the great majority of the unfortunate cavaliers, he wandered about in complete dependence upon his more fortunate friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, ed. Berdan, 39). He may sometimes have worked on royalist newspapers in London but that remains uncertain. It is certain, on the other hand, that when he was arrested on 10 November 1655 he admitted to having been in London about a year beforehand. His arrest probably took place at Norwich, where he was living in the house of an Edward Cooke. He claimed to be Cooke's private tutor but those who arrested him seem to have been uneasy about the claim, for Cooke was well known as a royalist sympathizer who drew other such folk about him; moreover, Cleveland's genteel garb but lack of funds, along with his role at Newark and his acknowledged abilities, excited suspicion. Consequently he was imprisoned at Great Yarmouth for three months, whereupon he wrote to Cromwell and obtained his release (the exact date of which is not known). The letter to Cromwell has been admired for the way in which its author pleads his cause without demeaning that of his party.<br>
<br>After his release Cleveland appears to have had no fixed abode. There is a likelihood that from the latter half of 1657 he lived at Gray's Inn, London, and that he received financial support from a John Onebye who came from Hinckley, where the poet's father had been vicar. Cleveland died in London of an intermittent fever on 29 April 1658. He was buried on 1 May at the church of St Michael Royal, College Hill, London, and the preacher at his funeral was Dr John Pearson, one of his contemporaries at Cambridge.<br>
<br>In 1675 Edward Phillips described Cleveland's high standing as a poet: &#145;a Notable High soaring Witty Loyalist &hellip; he appear'd the first, if not only, Eminent Champion in verse against the <i>Presbyterian</i> Party&#146;. He also noted that some &#145;Grave Men&#146; declared Cleveland to be &#145;the best of English Poets&#146;  (E. Phillips, <span class="italic">Theatrum poetarum</span>, 1675, 104&#150;5). But the decline of his reputation, so high during Cleveland's lifetime, had already begun by this point. His use of catachresis, and the influence of that use, were attacked in Dryden's <span class="italic">An Essay of Dramatick Poesie</span>, &#145;that which the world has blam'd in our satyrist Cleveland; to express a thing hard and unnaturally, is his new way of Elocution&#146;. Dryden also observed that Cleveland expressed &#145;common thoughts in abstruse words&#146;  (J. Dryden, <span class="italic">Essay of Dramatick Poesie</span>, 1668, 42&#150;4). The disparagement just quoted is, however, almost immediately followed by praise for lines 63&#150;4 of &#145;The Rebell Scot&#146;. Samuel Johnson famously added to Dryden's dispraise of Cleveland in his &#145;Life of Cowley&#146;. The revival of Cleveland's reputation in more recent times effectively dates from Berdan's edition of the poems in 1903.<br>
