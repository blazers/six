<span class="headword">Cooper <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Price]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1698, <em>d.</em> 1761?), <span class="occ">playwright and anthologist</span>, was the daughter of Aubrey Price (<i>d</i>. 1698) and his wife, Bridget Claypoole (<i>c</i>.1674&#150;1738), daughter of John Claypoole, Oliver Cromwell's son-in-law and master of horse, and his second wife. Both her mother and grandmother were unfortunate in choosing the men in whom they placed their trust: though Blanche Claypoole had brought to her marriage perhaps &pound;10,000, Bridget, already an orphan and her parents' only heir, was at or shortly after Elizabeth's birth a widow and a pauper. Where Elizabeth was born, brought up, and educated remains unknown, but both her parents during their brief marriage and she herself after her own marriage inhabited various parishes in Westminster. On 25 February 1722 she married John Cooper (1691&#150;1729), a successful auctioneer in Covent Garden of major art and book collections such as those of the duke of Portland and Dr Woodward. They had six children, including one who died in its first year, before John Cooper's death in 1729 (when she may have been pregnant with a seventh). Their house (cum auction rooms) in the Great Piazza was visited by scholars such as Thomas Birch, and it was presumably through a shared interest in the contents of the books and manuscripts passing through that she came to know the writer and theatrical entrepreneur James Ralph and the antiquary William Oldys. John Cooper's own art collection was sold at auction in 1730, as well as the house, the latter perhaps to the auctioneer Christopher Cock (immortalized by Fielding), with whom Cooper had sometimes been associated.<br>
<br>In the 1730s Elizabeth Cooper seems to have been seeking a means of financial support. Early in 1734 she acted as a member of the company at Drury Lane in Ralph's <span class="italic">The Cornish Squire</span> and a pantomime, <span class="italic">Cupid and Psyche, or, Columbine Courtezan</span>. That April she organized a benefit for herself at Lincoln's Inn Fields, Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span>, with herself playing Lady Easy. Her activities then expanded to playwriting: in 1735 appeared at Covent Garden <span class="italic">The Rival Widows</span>, in which she played the lead for her two benefits, and the following year at the Haymarket <span class="italic">The Nobleman</span>, which reached the third night benefit but which was never printed. Fielding's <span class="italic">Pasquin</span> was that season the sensational hit at his and Ralph's theatre, the Haymarket, and though Ralph had foregone production of one of his own plays to extend its run, he is said to have urged that Mrs Cooper's play be produced. But then came Walpole's <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>, which closed the Haymarket and ended Fielding's dramatic career and incidentally Mrs Cooper's as well.<br>
<br>Cooper then turned to compiling an anthology of English poetry from the eleventh century (Edward the Confessor) to the sixteenth (Samuel Daniel). For this she borrowed books from William Oldys and sought unpublished manuscripts from poets' families. Cooper added biographical information about the poets and gave brief critical assessments of the works. The volume, called <span class="italic">The Muses Library</span>, is competent in every respect and remains well worth reading. It has been credited by reputable modern scholars as the model for Samuel Johnson's format in his <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span> and as the chief inspiration for Thomas Chatterton's antique style. Elizabeth Cooper planned a further volume, of poetic theory, but unhappily the first failed to sell well, and the project collapsed.<br>
<br>The last record of Cooper, in a letter of disputable date (probably 1742), places her in St James's. J. Yeowell wrote that she died on 5 August 1761, but David Baker wrote in 1764 &#145;Of this Lady, who is still living, and whom we must rank among the Female Geniuses of this Kingdom&#146;  (Baker, sig. H1<i>r</i>).<br>
