<span class="headword">Collins,  William John Thomas</span>  (1788&#150;1847), <span class="occ">landscape and genre painter</span>, was born on 18 September 1788 at Great Titchfield Street, London. He was one of three children; an elder sister died before his birth and his younger brother, Francis, predeceased him in 1833. His father, William Collins (<i>d</i>. 1812), was Irish but had settled in England. He was a picture dealer and writer and the author of a memoir of the painter George Morland (1763&#150;1804), who had allowed the young artist to observe him at work in his studio. Although in later years Collins denied that he had gleaned any useful training from Morland, a comparison between their work demonstrates that Collins emulated Morland's work, both in its style and subject matter. Collins's mother (<i>d</i>. 1833) was from Edinburgh. Collins entered the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1807 and thereafter began to exhibit small landscapes and genre subjects. He also produced a few portraits during these early years, presumably to supplement his income rather than from any real vocation in that direction. In 1813 he had his first popular success at the Royal Academy exhibition with <span class="italic">The Sale of the Pet Lamb</span> (Guildhall Art Gallery, London). The composition, combining a narrative incident of touching pathos with a carefully observed landscape setting, became the model for future subjects. The popularity of such pictures ensured Collins's election as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1814. <span class="italic">The Reluctant Departure</span> (1815; Birmingham City Art Gallery) was the first of many seashore compositions adopting a similar sentimental formula, as a mother takes leave of her child. It is typical of Collins's early highly finished and luminous style. Collins's choice of narrative genre subjects was not wholly original but formed part of a revival of interest in genre painting in Britain during the early decades of the nineteenth century. The taste for narrative scenes from everyday life was epitomized in the work of Sir David Wilkie (1785&#150;1841), whose early popular success encouraged other artists, including Collins, William Mulready (1786&#150;1863), and Thomas Webster (1800&#150;1886), to experiment with similar themes. Collins and Wilkie became close friends and Wilkie's influence is clearly present in Collins's choice of subjects. Collins's most original contribution to genre painting was in the recurrent and popular theme of childhood and he was one of the most successful artists to deal consistently with this theme. His childhood genre subjects were predominately rural, set against a backdrop of a country cottage or village scene and focused on a trivial domestic incident, as in <span class="italic">The Kitten Deceived</span> (1816; Guildhall Art Gallery, London).<br>
<br>Following the death of his father in 1812, and subsequent financial concerns, Collins appears to have made a deliberate decision to widen the scope of his subject matter in the hope of increasing his commissions. In 1816 he made a prolonged stay at Hastings and thereafter began to paint coastal subjects which, however, still relied on the activities of shrimp boys and fishermen's children, working or playing by the seashore, for their main interest. A slight variation on the coastal subjects were those of children fishing or playing by rivers or woodland streams: <span class="italic">Young Anglers</span> (1820; RA) was presented as his diploma picture following his election as a Royal Academician in 1820. In 1822 Collins married Harriet Geddes (1790&#150;1868), a cousin of the painter Andrew Geddes ARA (1783&#150;1844).<br>
<br>Collins was somewhat unusual as a painter of genre in habitually using a rural landscape setting for his compositions, particularly since he was born and permanently resided in London. Throughout his career, however, he made almost annual trips to stay at the houses and country seats of important patrons, among whom were Sir Robert Peel, Sir Thomas Baring, and Lord Liverpool. In addition to his short residences with patrons and friends, he also embarked on sketching tours solely with the aim of gathering material for his paintings. His earliest trips took him to the coast of Norfolk in 1815, Hastings in 1816, and the Lake District in 1818, where he became acquainted with the poets Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. During the course of his career he continued to travel widely in Britain and in the 1820s took up summer residences in Hampstead or Hendon, in the countryside north of London, so that he could sketch directly from nature. It is in his approach to naturalism that Collins's work can be related to the landscape paintings of his contemporaries although, unlike John Constable (1776&#150;1837) and the painters of the Norwich school, he seems to have built up his compositions by sketching the components directly from the motif and combining them in his studio to form imaginary landscapes. His aim was not simply to capture the beauties of an actual scene but to create a suitably idealized backdrop for his narrative events. During the 1830s the narrative element of Collins's genre scenes, particularly those involving children, took on a more vigorous role. The comparatively uneventful scenes of his earlier works gave way to compositions with a more actively dramatic element, as in <span class="italic">Rustic Civility</span> (1833; V&amp;A), one of the artist's most original compositions. As his subjects became more lively, so did his brushwork, and he no longer painted with the high degree of finish that had made his earlier works so attractive.<br>
<br>Collins's foreign travels were few; his first journey abroad, in 1817, was to Paris in the company of the painters Washington Allston (1779&#150;1843) and Charles Robert Leslie (1794&#150;1859). He visited Holland and Belgium in 1828, Boulogne in 1829, and Germany in 1840. The only prolonged foreign journey was to Italy, between 1836 and 1838. The trip had an important impact in providing material for a new range of Italian subjects, including landscapes and genre. Soon after his return from Italy he began to produce a range of figure subjects such as <span class="italic">Poor Travellers at the Door of a Capuchin Convent, Near Vico, Bay of Naples</span> (1839; Sudley Art Gallery, Liverpool), as well as scenes illustrating events from biblical history. Collins continued to exhibit Italian and figure subjects until 1844 when, according to his son, his illness caused him to revert to more familiar subjects. However, his return to his more popular English landscapes may have been the result of the criticism which his new endeavours had received. His final works were mostly coastal views, which resulted from short trips to the Isle of Wight in 1844 and Devon in 1845. His last important work was <span class="italic">Early Morning&#151;Cromer</span> (1846; Tate collection), which, prior to its exhibition that year, was praised by John Ruskin in his <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span>.<br>
<br>Collins was an established figure in his profession and throughout his life was closely involved with Royal Academy affairs, serving as librarian in 1840&#150;42. He died at his home, 1 Devonport Street, Hyde Park Gardens, London, on 17 February 1847 and was buried at St Mary's, Paddington. He had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5961/', "William Wilkie Collins (1824&#150;1889)")</script>, the novelist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5935/', "Charles Allston Collins (1828&#150;1873)")</script>, the Pre-Raphaelite painter.<br>
