<span class="headword">Farnon,  Robert Joseph</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">composer and musical arranger</span>, was born on 24 July 1917 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the second son and third of four children in a musical family: his father, a clothier, played the violin, and his mother played the piano. He himself learned to play the violin, piano, percussion, and trumpet, while still young. He gained experience on radio as a teenager and became, at nineteen, lead trumpet in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra (conducted by Percy Faith). He was also, from 1937 to 1943, a member of the Happy Gang, broadcasting skits, comedy routines, and a variety of musical items each weekday lunchtime on CBC Radio. On trips to New York he played in jam sessions with Dizzy Gillespie and Oscar Peterson, both of whom became lifelong friends. He studied composition with Louis Waizman, and initially had high-art ambitions, composing two symphonies (the first given a performance by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1942). In September 1944, as a Canadian army captain, he came to Britain as conductor of, and arranger for, the Canadian band of the allied expeditionary forces. His forces' post gave him an opportunity to experiment creatively within lighter idioms.<br>
<br>Farnon decided to settle in England after the war. British bandleaders like Bert Ambrose and Lew Stone had already taken to his music, and he soon found work as an arranger for Geraldo, whose band he took over when Geraldo embarked on an American tour in 1947. The next year the Robert Farnon Orchestra was heard frequently on radio, and he was also working for Decca as a house conductor and arranger. His reputation was clinched with Decca's release of the vinyl 78 rpm disc number F9038 towards the end of 1948. This became one of the most celebrated of all light music recordings containing, as it did, &#145;Portrait of a Flirt&#146; on one side, and &#145;Jumping Bean&#146; on the other. The latter has been used more widely as a signature tune than any other piece of light music. &#145;Jumping Bean&#146; begins with a snarling brass tritone (the &#145;devil's interval&#146; or <i>diabolus in musica</i>), but then menace turns unexpectedly to comedy as the tension suddenly evaporates. The tritone was also used to comic effect in &#145;Peanut Polka&#146; (Decca LF1020, 1950). It is a mark of Farnon's talent that the tritone loses its usual associations with the demonic in the context of his musical idiom and becomes, instead, a source of amusement.<br>
<br>Farnon became interested in composing for screen, and made his first individual and distinctive contribution to film music with his score to <span class="italic">Just William's Luck</span> in 1947, in which he created an influential vocabulary of comic musical devices. Humour in music was always something at which Farnon excelled. The next year he was composing for another William film, as well as providing music for <span class="italic">Spring in Park Lane</span>, one of Britain's commercially most successful films, starring Anna Neagle and Michael Wilding. The closing titles music, for orchestra and wordless chorus, revealed his orchestral palette at its richest. The opening titles music anticipated his arrangements of traditional material on Frank Sinatra's album <span class="italic">Great Songs from Great Britain</span> (1962). Sinatra (who nicknamed Farnon the Guv'nor) was just one of many singers for whom he composed and arranged; the list included Tony Bennett, Gracie Fields, and Vera Lynn, as well as such lesser-known figures as Beryl Davis, Denny Dennis, and Donald Peers. Farnon's film score to <span class="italic">Captain Horatio Hornblower RN</span> (1951) showed his ability to compete with the swashbuckling Hollywood style of Erich Korngold. Among the many other films for which he composed were <span class="italic">Expresso Bongo</span> (1959), starring Cliff Richard, and the final Bob Hope and Bing Crosby collaboration, <span class="italic">Road to Hong Kong</span> (1962). In the mid-1950s, in Toronto, he married Patricia (Pat) Smith, a casting director, with whom he had five sons and two daughters. About 1959 they moved to Guernsey, where Farnon continued to compose prolifically. During the 1970s, when interest in light music had faded, he was writing scores for TV series, including <span class="italic">Colditz</span> (1972&#150;4) and <span class="italic">Secret Army</span> (1977&#150;9).<br>
<br>Farnon was a versatile composer who could turn his hand to any musical mood, but he was without equal in his ability to communicate joy through music. Andr&eacute; Previn reputedly called him &#145;the greatest living writer for strings in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 April 2005). His polished technique can be heard to effect in &#145;Westminster Waltz&#146; (Decca F10818, 1956), which won for Farnon one of his four Ivor Novello awards; another was given for outstanding services to British music (1991). In 1996 he received a Grammy award for best instrumental arrangement (for &#145;Lament&#146;, performed by J. J. Johnson and the Robert Farnon Orchestra). He was honoured with the order of Canada in 1988.<br>
<br>Farnon was influenced early in his career by the British light music composer Eric Coates, especially regarding the care taken over orchestral effects, but became himself a major influence on the sound of light music after the Second World War. Many of his characteristic devices, such as the use of divided strings sweeping up and down in parallel motion, as well as decorative wind phrases, harp glissandi, and other musical devices that he termed &#145;gingerbread&#146;, were widely imitated. His music had an influence on the film composers Quincy Jones and John Williams. He never lost his interest in more classically oriented composition, as is evident in his rhapsody for violin and orchestra (a BBC commission of 1958), or one of his last works, the third symphony (first performed in Edinburgh in the month after his death). He regretted that he did not have more opportunity to work with jazz players he admired, especially with personal friends like Gillespie and Peterson.<br>
<br>Early in the twenty-first century there was a revival of interest in Farnon's compositions, thanks to their being championed by the conductors Ronald Corp and John Wilson. He was therefore enjoying renewed attention in the years before he died peacefully, during the early hours of 23 April 2005, in St Martin's, Guernsey. He was survived by his wife, Pat, and their seven children. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 24 July.<br>
