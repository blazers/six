<span class="headword">Hubback <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spielman]</span>,  Eva Marian</span>  (1886&#150;1949), <span class="occ">social reformer and feminist</span>, was born at 23 Oxford Square, London, on 13 April 1886, the second child and elder daughter in the family of two daughters and two sons of Sir Meyer Adam Spielman (1856&#150;1936), stockbroker (later inspector of Home Office schools), and his wife, Gertrude Emily (1864&#150;1949), daughter of George Raphael, banker. After St Felix School, Southwold, Eva persuaded her parents to allow her to go up to Newnham College, Cambridge, in October 1905. This was the formative time of her life intellectually&#151;she took a first in part two of the economics tripos in 1908&#151;and emotionally, through enduring friendships formed. Her circle included Rupert Brooke, Dudley Ward, the Olivier sisters, Dorothy Layton, Ka Cox, and Shena Potter.<br>
<br>In 1911, after voluntary social work for the London county council and for the suffragists, Eva Spielman married Francis William Hubback, son of John Hubback, corn merchant of Liverpool. He had been a Cambridge friend and was then lecturing in classics and economic history at Manchester University. She shared his love of strenuous holidays by the sea and in the mountains, and retained it throughout life. Two daughters and a son were born to them before Bill was killed on the western front in February 1917. Eva Hubback taught economics briefly at Newnham in 1916&#150;17 before becoming parliamentary secretary to the suffragists, in 1919 transformed into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. She rapidly mastered the art of lobbying, working on all legislation concerning women and children, from franchise reform to divorce law. Her organizational flair complemented the charisma of Eleanor Rathbone in the campaign for family allowances.<br>
<br>In 1927 Eva succeeded Barbara Wootton as principal of Morley College, which provided non-vocational adult education in Lambeth. She secured new buildings; and her recruitment of distinguished lecturers and performers from many spheres brought intellectual excitement and cultural richness. Morley became well known for its music (Sir Michael Tippett), its theatre and ballet (Rupert Doone), and its art (Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden). Morley took up her evenings but daytime was given to voluntary work. Her initiatives led to the creation in 1930 of the Townswomen's Guilds, the founding, with Sir Ernest Simon, of the Association for Education in Citizenship (1934), and the launching of the Children's Minimum Committee (1936) to campaign for better standards of care and nutrition. She became a JP in 1939 and a London county council Labour councillor in 1946. Her work for the Eugenics Society and the Family Planning Association gave her a keen interest in population issues. Many considered she should have been a member of the royal commission on population (1946&#150;9), but she did give evidence and published her widely read <span class="italic">The Population of Britain</span> in 1947. Perhaps her very strengths, her enthusiasm and drive for so many causes, led to inadequate public recognition of her work. Illness and death came suddenly: it was as if, over many years, she had simply worn herself out. Eva Hubback died at Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex, on 15 July 1949.<br>
