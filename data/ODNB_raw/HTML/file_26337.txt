<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stebbing,  Henry</span>  (1799&#150;1883), <span class="occ">author and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 26 August 1799 at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the son of John Stebbing (<i>d</i>. 1826) and his wife, Mary Rede (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1843), who was from a prominent Suffolk family. By the time he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1818 he was already a published author, having in August produced <span class="italic">The Minstrel of the Glen and other Poems</span>, which, while patently romantic juvenilia (in one poem a sun sets in the east), attracted favourable notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Stebbing graduated BA from St John's (having migrated briefly to Sidney Sussex in 1819/20) in 1823 and MA in 1827; he was a DD in 1839 and was admitted <i>ad eundem</i> at Oxford in 1857. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Bathurst of Norwich (a family friend) in 1822 and priested the following year, and then undertook duties as a curate in three parishes, including that of Felthorpe, Norfolk, reputedly riding 40 miles each Sunday to serve his churches.<br>
<br>In 1824 Stebbing was appointed perpetual curate of Ilketshall St Lawrence, Suffolk, the same year in which he married, on 21 December, Mary Griffin (1805&#150;1882), a daughter of William Griffin of Norwich, with whom he had nine children who survived infancy. These included Henry Theophilus (1825&#150;1863), who assisted Stebbing in his literary labours; John (1829&#150;1885), who translated Humboldt and Thiers; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38300/', "Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing (1835&#150;1926)")</script>, a divinity lecturer at Worcester College, Oxford, who became a Darwinian apologist and a fierce critic of orthodox Christianity; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38888/', "William Stebbing (1831&#150;1926)")</script>, a barrister and assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the 1870s. Two of his daughters, Beatrice (later Batty) and Grace (<i>fl</i>. 1876&#150;1888), also achieved renown as authors. During 1825 Stebbing supplemented his income by taking the duties of evening lecturer at Bungay, Suffolk, and during 1825&#150;6 served as usher under Richard Valpy at Norwich grammar school, where he was remembered as a popular master.<br>
<br>Stebbing's life took a decisive turn when, as one obituarist believed, thirsting &#145;for access to London publishers and London literary society&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 29 Sept 1883, 400), he transferred his family to London, probably in 1827. He continued his clerical career, from 1829 serving as alternate morning preacher at St James's Chapel in Hampstead Road, St Pancras, the funeral chapel for St James's, Piccadilly. In 1834 he assumed the duties of chaplain to University College Hospital (a post he retained until 1879), and after serving for less than a year as incumbent of Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, on the nomination of John Norris, Stebbing returned to London in 1836 to take charge of St James's&#151;in effect as a proprietary chapel. He seems to have been a diligent pastor, and claimed to have conducted more than 18,000 funerals. In 1849 he assumed responsibility for the parochial district added to the chapel, establishing a district school and attending the local workhouse when other local clergy refused.<br>
<br>It was as a literary figure, however, that Stebbing now established his reputation. Although he later told potential patrons that his writing was a burden undertaken to support his large family, it is clear that he relished both authorship and the literary circles into which he was absorbed, the Thackerian aspects of which he would later recall, along with his Norwich years, in his novel <span class="italic">Near the Cloisters</span> (1868). His career as a contributor to periodical literature commenced with a review for the evangelical <span class="italic">Christian Review and Clerical Magazine</span> in 1827, but only a year later he was a key figure in the foundation of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, serving as working editor after the first few numbers, and contributing editorials and many reviews of books &#145;of the contents of which I knew little, and of the meaning less&#146;  (&#145;Athenaeum in 1828&#150;30&#146;, 88), until he was succeeded as editor by F. D. Maurice.<br>
<br>Between 1830 and the mid-1850s Stebbing produced a continuous stream of publications, many on a considerable scale. He published more of his poetry; produced a three-volume <span class="italic">Lives of the Italian Poets</span> (1831), dedicated to and much admired by Samuel Rogers; briefly conducted a periodical, the <span class="italic">Christian Enquirer and Literary Companion</span> (1848); and produced popular editions of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which long remained in currency on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as theological works and sermons, histories, and editions of Defoe's works. The most significant element of his work, much of it contributed to popular series such as Lardner's <span class="roman">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</span> or his own thirty-volume <span class="roman">Library of English Sacred Classics</span> (1834&#150;6), conducted with R. Cattermole, consisted of editions of major English theologians and religious literature (including Bunyan, Cowper, and Milton), translations of religious travel literature and history, and his original contributions to the history of the church. These began with a history of the crusades (1829&#150;30) and embraced studies of the primitive church (1845), the medieval church (1833&#150;4, 1849), the Reformation (1836&#150;7), and the period between the diet of Augsburg and the eighteenth century (1839&#150;42).<br>
<br>The apparent contradiction between a clerical career and the literary activity through which he came to know Southey, Coleridge, Scott, Dickens, and Thomas Campbell was recognized but deplored by Stebbing, who argued in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and elsewhere that the divorce between contemporary literature and the Church of England was a significant weakness in the religious life of the nation. This argument was partly fuelled by Stebbing's resentment at the failure of the literary labours, which in 1845 earned him a fellowship of the Royal Society, to win him ecclesiastical preferment, despite a series of pleading letters to both Gladstone and Bishop Blomfield. By the late 1840s he was sufficiently disenchanted publicly to demand reform of the patronage system and a tax on dignities, and to support the radical Edward Horsman's opposition to the creation of a Manchester bishopric (a later radical moment would see him protest against the Crimean War). In 1857, however, the new bishop of London, A. C. Tait, offered Stebbing the City living of St Mary Somerset with St Mary Mountshaw, a preferment accepted by Stebbing in an almost hysterical letter. After this he seems to have scaled down his literary activities, although he still complained of his inadequate income. In consequence he sub-let, rather than totally severed his connection with, St James's, Hampstead Road, and he remained resident in its parsonage for the remainder of his life. His parochial responsibilities were increased by the addition to his parish of the churches of St Nicholas Cole Abbey and St Nicholas Olave in 1866, and then of St Benet Paul's Wharf in June 1879.<br>
<br>In 1844 Stebbing was described to the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;decidedly low church&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. c. 290). He might have resented this, for although clearly an evangelical committed to the Reformation as a landmark in the history of the advance of both truth and true religion, his theological, pastoral, and historical writings reveal a complicated position incompatible with evangelical partisanship, not least in an overwhelming commitment to religious tolerance which underpinned criticism of both Calvin and the English Reformers where they had persecuted their religious opponents. Moreover, Stebbing encouraged his flock at St James's to observe at least fast and saints' days if not the daily service, and strongly valued the visible church. The final chapter of his <span class="italic">History of the Church from the Diet of Augsburg</span> (1842) is remarkable for his sympathetic account of the origins of the Tractarian movement as in part a reaction to evangelical deficiencies. The fact that he adopted the evangelical practice of extemporary preaching was more a response to the demands of his other literary activities than an indication of party alignment. Stebbing was always a popular preacher, however, and he continued to preach until shortly before his death at St James's parsonage, Hampstead Road, on 22 September 1883, his family linking his decline to the death of his wife the previous year. He was buried on 27 September in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
