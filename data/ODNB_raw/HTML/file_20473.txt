<span class="headword">&Oacute; Bruadair,  D&aacute;ibh&iacute;</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1698?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, has left little documentary evidence of his life apart from his poems. Even these have very little concrete information and so much of what can be said about him is speculation, however plausible. The surname &Oacute; Bruadair may be an amalgamation of the Gaelic Ua/&Oacute; (=grandson of) and the Norse Brodir and it occurs in several places in Ireland, especially in Munster and south-east Leinster. The surname is Anglicized as Bruder and Broderick. D&aacute;ibh&iacute; was associated with both co. Cork and co. Limerick and the suggestion that he was born and brought up in the former is very likely. Some of his poems refer to the Barrys of Timoleague as being his early friends and patrons. His literary early connections are also with co. Cork. Although he did not belong to one of the hereditary families of learning he had obviously received training in one of the poetic schools which were in a state of great decline in the first half of the seventeenth century, probably the school of the &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh poetic clan at Blarney. His date of birth can be speculated by working back from the earliest of his poems that can be dated which is about 1648, suggesting that he may have been born about 1625 or even slightly earlier. His family seem to have been moderately well off as he often makes comparisons between the conditions of his early life and later hardships. There is no record of when he transferred to co. Limerick but it must have been in the 1650s or early 1660s when he looked for and received patronage from the well-to-do families of that territory, the Roches, Bourkes, and Fitzgeralds.<br>
<br>As mentioned above &Oacute; Bruadair did not belong to one of the hereditary families of traditional learning and before this period of decline this would have shut him out for ever from becoming a master of what he called the &#145;s&eacute;ada r&uacute;in&#146; or mysterious treasures of traditional Irish lore. However one of the features of the decline was that those, like him, who were interested and able, took the place of the traditional families and acted as preservers and transmitters of that lore. They read and wrote Irish, making important copies of the few manuscripts there were, and taught others to do likewise. Some, like D&aacute;ibh&iacute;, were inspired to add their own compositions to this work of preservation. D&aacute;ibh&iacute; is known to have written manuscripts, making at least one copy of Geoffrey Keating's &#145;History of Ireland&#146; and a copy of another historical compilation of the well-known O'Mulconry family of hereditary historians. Unfortunately there are only fragments of his scribal work still extant.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Bruadair also copied his own poems and Se&aacute;n Stack, a scribe who copied them from D&aacute;ibh&iacute;'s hand, reports that the poet himself annotated them in English, although Stack was unwilling to &#145;stain his own book with English&#146;. We have some proof of &Oacute; Bruadair's knowledge of and competence in English. One of his patrons and a friend, Sir John Fitzgerald of Clenlish, co. Limerick, was implicated in the Popish Plot and D&aacute;ibh&iacute; wrote a poem in Irish accompanied by a letter in English to Lord Chief Justice John Keating in 1682 thanking him for the fact that Fitzgerald and others had been acquitted. The letter not only shows him to be interested in affairs of political importance, it also contains some direct information about himself which is worth quoting:<blockquote>The Author of the Inclosed Poem is a man not concerned at all in the Weighty Affairs of this World, yet see'th an can smile or frown on things as well as any other fool. He is a great Lover and admirer of honest men, and as great a hater of the adverse party. He holdeth his abode in the proximity of a quiet Company, the Dead, being banished the Society of the living for want of means to rent so much as a House and Garden amongst them. He lives like a Sexton without Salary, in the Corner of a Churchyard, in a Cottage (thanks be to God) as well contented with his stock, which is only a little Dog, a Cat, and a Cock, as the Prince of Parma with all his Principalities. (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, ed. MacErlean, 1.xxxiii&#150;xxxiv)</blockquote>Although &Oacute; Bruadair above indicates his satisfaction with his lowly estate a poem composed, according to its title in 1674, &#145;Mairg n&aacute;r chrean re maitheas saoghalta&#146; (&#145;Alas the person who did not save worldly wealth&#146;), on the occasion of his fall from a comfortable position, also gives us personal information about him. The title declares him to be stricken with poverty (&#145;i nd&iacute;th costais&#146;) and tells us that his friends did not come to his aid. In it he contrasts his former condition when he had money to spend and was acceptable to all and sundry as both poet and wit with his present penury and isolation. Having lost his means of wealth, probably his entitlement to sufficient land, he has become an outcast and &#145;a horseman on foot&#146;. Servants will no longer serve him drink and food and he must engage in manual labour with a spade which causes his knuckles to swell and gives him pains in his joints. The complaint is made even more effective as &Oacute; Bruadair sees his suffering in contrast with the honour due to a poet and scholar in the Gaelic tradition. For example, a poet who was forced to travel on foot would be a disgrace not only to himself but also to all those who could be considered his potential patrons. This poem also mentions a wife and family but it is not known who the wife was nor how many children he had.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Bruadair's poetry spans almost the whole of the second half of the seventeenth century. This alone makes it of great importance. Altogether about seventy items exist which can be confidently ascribed to him and most of these have been published, with copious notes and literal, but sometimes untrustworthy, translations, in the three-volume edition by John C. MacErlean, (1910&#150;17). These poems cover not only the demise of poetry and learning but also comprise a sharp and invaluable commentary on the politics and events of Irish history from Cromwell to the penal laws. His poetry clearly portrays each of the most important events and the major personalities with realistic changes of mood as the fortunes of the native Irish ebbed and flowed. It is notable that as his own fortunes changed for the worse his poetry became more eloquent and passionate. There is no direct evidence that he had read the political poetry in English of the period, like that of Abraham Cowley, or Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>, or the <span class="italic">Poems on the Affairs of State</span>, but the flavour of his work is very similar to all of these. He combines this sharp political commentary with a metrical and verbal virtuosity that has seldom been equalled in Irish. Some of his poems were translated into English by the Irish writer James Stephens, who described &Oacute; Bruadair's poetry as &#145;an unending rebellious bawl which would be the most desolating utterance ever made by man, if it were not also the most gleeful&#146;. A more recent, and equally free, verse translation of a selection of the poems was published by Michael Hartnett, an Irish poet hailing from the border region between Limerick and co. Kerry that was &Oacute; Bruadair's home in the second part of his life.<br>
<br>Like much else about &Oacute; Bruadair's life the date of his death is uncertain. He is known to have followed the careers of the &#145;Wild Geese&#146;, military exiles who went to the continent after the treaty of Limerick, especially Patrick Sarsfield and his friend and patron Sir John Fitzgerald, the fortunes of both of whom he celebrated in poems. His last datable poem was composed in 1693 and most scholars believe he died about five years later in 1698. There is a tradition that he lived for a number of years longer.<br>
