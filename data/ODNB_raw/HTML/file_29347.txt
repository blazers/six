<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wiche,  John</span>  (1718&#150;1794), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister</span>, was born at Taunton, Somerset, on 24 April 1718. His parents were members of Mary Street Baptist Church whose pastor, Joseph Jefferies senior (<i>d</i>. 1746), had rejected Calvinism. Jefferies, who baptized the sixteen-year-old Wiche in the meeting-house on 25 June 1734, and Thomas Lucas, Baptist minister at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, from 1721 to 1743, provided his early education. Joseph Burroughs and James Foster, Socinian pastors of London's non-aligned Paul's Alley/Barbican Baptist Church found assistance from the General Baptist Fund in 1726 for Wiche to study successively at the liberal dissenting academies at Taunton, Kendal (1738&#150;9), and Findern (1740).<br>
<br>In 1743 Wiche went to assist a Mr Phillips, an aged Baptist minister at Salisbury, who soon died leaving Wiche as pastor. Here he met and corresponded with the deist writer Thomas Chubb who lived nearby. In addition, Chubb's sermon <span class="italic">Englishmen Urged to Loyalty by their Sense and Love of Liberty</span>, about the 1745 Jacobite uprising, foreshadowed Wiche's future concerns for civil and religious liberty. In 1746 Burroughs and Foster introduced him to a small General Baptist church meeting at Rose Yard, Maidstone, and Tovil in Kent. Here he remained as elder for the rest of his life. As a means of livelihood he established a school. In 1755 he married Elizabeth Pine (1735/6&#150;1766) of the leading family in the church. Of their six children, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 11 July 1821, aged sixty-three) became a London bookseller; Sarah married the banker Sampson Kingsford (<i>d</i>. 1821), General Baptist elder and messenger from Canterbury; and Mary married John Evans (1767&#150;1827), pastor of the General Baptist church meeting in Worship Street, London.<br>
<br>When, in 1759, Nathaniel Lardner published his <span class="italic">Letter on the Logos</span> (written 1730) postulating &#145;that Jesus Christ is a man with a reasonable soul and a human body&#146;  (Wilbur, 2.265), Wiche read it and became a Unitarian. He also began a correspondence with Lardner which lasted until Lardner's death. Lardner's <span class="italic">Letter</span> also converted Joseph Priestley to Unitarian beliefs, and later, under the pseudonym Nazaraeus, Wiche contributed &#145;Observations favouring the miraculous conception&#146; to Priestley's <span class="italic">Theological Repository</span> (5, 1786). Later, after the 1791 Birmingham riots had driven Priestley from his home, Wiche personally approached Henry Dundas on Priestley's behalf. Another of Wiche's correspondents was the Anglican theologian Francis Blackburne. When Wiche publicly supported Blackburne's <span class="italic">Confessional</span>, which called for an end to subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, the two men entered into another extended correspondence. Until the American war, Wiche had loyally responded to every public fast. The war caused him to re-examine this practice, and henceforth he rejected public fasts as dependent on human authority. Likewise, he rejected Christmas day worship as based on the human authority of the papacy. Scripture alone was the only permitted authority. Eventually he abandoned sermons for scriptural exposition, and regarded public prayers that used the &#145;we&#146; form as presumptive and unscriptural.<br>
<br>A frugal person, Wiche's only extravagance was to buy books, and he amassed a considerable library. &#145;Let all descriptions of men write and publish what they please, and every thing that is false can be refuted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Protestant Dissenter's Magazine</span>, April 1797, 128) was his firmly held belief. After he died, on 7 April 1794 at Maidstone, his General Baptist church amalgamated with the Presbyterian/Unitarian congregation in Earle Street, Maidstone, where another friend, William Hazlitt senior (1737&#150;1817), was once minister. Wiche was buried at the General Baptist burial-ground in Tovil, near Maidstone. Quiet and retiring, he valued personal honesty and truthful searching more than popular appeal in ministry. George Wiche (1767&#150;1799), Unitarian minister at Monton, Eccles, Lancashire, from 1788 to 1795, was his nephew.<br>
