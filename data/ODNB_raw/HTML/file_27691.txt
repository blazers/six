<span class="headword">Tremayne,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1582), <span class="occ">administrator and conspirator</span>, was the second son of Thomas Tremayne, gentleman, of Collacombe, Devon, and Philippa, daughter of Roger Grenville of Stow. Nothing is known of his early life. Late in 1553 he entered the service of Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon, and was sent to the Tower in February or March of 1554 on suspicion of involvement in Wyatt's rebellion. Despite torture, he refused to provide evidence against either Courtenay or the Princess Elizabeth. Released on 18 January 1555 on payment of a fine of &pound;40, he followed Courtenay to the continent where the earl established a household in Venice by mid-January 1556. Tremayne, however, left Courtenay's service soon after, probably as a consequence of his master's refusal to enter more actively into the conspiracies against Mary organized from France by Sir Henry Dudley. Tremayne's brother Nicholas was deeply involved in the conspiracy and had carried proposals from Dudley to Courtenay in Italy, meeting the earl in Ferrara on 21 March 1556, together with Francis Russell, earl of Bedford. However, Courtenay would not commit irrevocably to the conspiracy by joining the rebels.<br>
<br>It is likely that Edmund Tremayne returned with his brother to Paris, where he is recorded by 13 July 1556, but soon after departed for the English rebel camp at Rouen. Despite their adherence to the rebels and their presence in Paris in April 1557 in the company of Christopher Assheton, a leader in the Dudley conspiracy, and the Staffords, neither Edmund nor his brothers followed Thomas Stafford in his assault on Scarborough Castle later that month. Almost simultaneously, the betrayal of the Dudley conspiracy (April 1557) resulted in the dissolution of the rebel faction in France. It is likely that it was at this time that Edmund Tremayne joined the household of the earl of Bedford, who is documented in Calais on 26 July 1557.<br>
<br>The accession of Elizabeth brought Tremayne quick preferment from both Bedford and the queen. He was returned to parliament in 1559 for Tavistock, and appointed deputy butler for Devon in 1561 through the patronage of Bedford who had been named lord lieutenant. Between 1561 and 1574 he served as receiver in nine counties for the duchy of Lancaster, in which office his deputy was Humphrey Michell; Michell, a former servant to Edward Courtenay and a servant to Francis Russell, earl of Bedford, also sat several times in the Commons. William Cecil sent Tremayne to report on Ireland in 1569, and he subsequently wrote a report entitled <span class="italic">Causes why Ireland is not Reformed</span>. In May 1571 he was sworn clerk of the privy council. In 1572 he was returned MP for Plymouth, and on 13 March he inherited his family's estates on the death of his elder brother Roger. He remained interested in the Irish situation, visiting the island again in 1573; and in 1574 he was granted by the city of Exeter the reversion of Sir Gawen Carew's pension of &pound;40, and was serving as receiver of exchequer revenues for Devon. In that year he also undertook substantial renovations to his house at Collacombe.<br>
<br>Tremayne married in September 1576 Eulalia, daughter of Sir John St Leger (<i>c</i>.1516&#150;1593&times;6) of Annery, Devon; she outlived him. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, and a son, Francis (<i>d</i>. 1582), named for his patron, Bedford. In religion Edmund was an adherent of the west-country puritan faction. Much of his political activity was directed towards local issues. He was in 1576 involved in a parliamentary committee on ports, and was appointed piracy commissioner for Devon in 1577. In 1580 he was made a freeman of Plymouth. The close connection between Tremayne and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8022/', "Sir Francis Drake")</script> is reflected in the queen's instructions to Tremayne to register the treasure unloaded from the <span class="italic">Golden Hind</span> in October 1580. Charged to investigate the allegations of cruelty made against Drake by the Spanish ambassador, Tremayne found his cousin innocent.<br>
<br>Tremayne died in September 1582, at Collacombe, just weeks before his son. The earl of Bedford oversaw his will. His estates passed to his brother Degory, who erected a monument to five of his brothers, Roger, Edmund, <a href="#cosubject_27693">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and the twins Andrew and Nicholas. Both the latter had been involved in conspiracy against Mary, and Andrew was implicated with Sir Peter Carew and Sir Anthony Kingston; both brothers were killed at Newhaven in 1563. Edmund's effigy provides an image of the man late in life.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_27693"></a><span class="headword">Richard Tremayne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1584), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Devon, the fourth son of Thomas Tremayne and his wife, Philippa Grenville. He graduated BA from Exeter College, Oxford, in 1548 and was elected a fellow on 28 March 1553, proceeding MA on 17 July of that year. The accession of Mary drove Tremayne to flee to Louvain with his pupil, the son of Sir Nicholas Arnold. Early in 1556 he returned to England where he appears to have acted as an agent for the Dudley conspiracy, together with his brother Nicholas. Although discovered, both men escaped to France where they were joined by their elder brother Edmund. Soon afterwards Richard set out for Strasbourg, perhaps as an agent with Arthur Saule to try to convince John Brett to remain on the continent and not perform the queen's commission of searching out the exiles. Failing in that mission, Tremayne returned to France until the reign of Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Named archdeacon of Chichester in April 1559, that summer Tremayne accompanied James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, in secrecy to England from Geneva. In October 1559 he was restored to his fellowship at Oxford, and in January 1560 Bishop Grindal of London ordained him deacon; the following month he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. In addition he held several church livings in Cornwall and Devon. His continued absence from Oxford resulted in his losing his fellowship at Exeter College, and in February 1565 he migrated to Broadgates Hall. One year later, on 15 February 1566, he took the degree of BTh, followed on 26 April by that of DTh. On 19 September 1569 Tremayne married Joanna, daughter of Sir Piers Courtenay of Ugbrooke, who outlived him. They had a daughter, Mary, who became wife of Thomas Henslowe.<br>
<br>Richard Tremayne, like his brother Edmund, was a client of the earl of Bedford, who in 1570 recommended him unsuccessfully for the see of Exeter. He sat in convocation for Exeter and endorsed the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, speaking in favour of substantial revision to the prayer book, reflecting his puritan commitment. He had troubled relations with his bishop, William Bradbridge, over the licensing of an unfit puritan preacher and accusations of nepotism. Richard Tremayne was buried on 30 November 1584 at Lamerton.<br>
