<span class="headword">St George,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Master James of St George]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1306<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, is first recorded as Master James, son of Master John <i>cementarius</i>, working in 1261 with his father on the castle of Yverdon for Count Peter of Savoy, earl of Richmond (<i>d</i>. 1268); by 1265 he was chief master mason. In the 1260s and 1270s he was concerned with works throughout Savoy, notably Aosta, Chillon, and St Georges-d'Esp&eacute;ranche. He worked with the count's military engineer, Sir John de Masoz, knighted by Henry III after the siege of B&eacute;nauges (1254). It is probable that James, and the brothers Tassin and Giles of St George, masons named in the building accounts of Saxon (Valais) in 1279/80, all sprang from the well-authenticated &#145;de sancto Jorio&#146; family, originating at St Jeoire in Faucigny. But it is also possible that the surname by which he was known in England reflects his connection with the building of Count Philip of Savoy's castle of St Georges in the Viennois, which was nearing completion when Philip, who had succeeded his brother Count Peter in 1268, did homage there to his great-nephew, the as yet uncrowned Edward I, during Edward's return from crusade in 1273. Works were then also proceeding within a day's ride of St Georges at Voiron, La Cote, and St Laurent-du-Pont, visits to which might have occasioned Edward's first acquaintance with James's person and capabilities. Only for St Laurent, where the castle itself has disappeared, is there a substantial works account; in it &#145;tasks&#146; are assigned &#145;per dominum J de Masout et Magistrum Jacobum&#146; in the same terms as they are later authorized &#145;per dominum J de Bonovillario [deputy of Sir Otto Grandson] et Magistrum Jacobum&#146; at Conwy.<br>
<br>James St George first appears in English records in March 1278, when as Master James <i>ingeniator</i> he travelled to Wales &#145;to ordain the works of the castles there&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the King's Works</span>, 1.320). He thus assumed control of the works begun in July 1277, probably under the ageing Master Bertram <i>ingeniator</i> (<i>d</i>. 1284), at Flint, Rhuddlan, Ruthin, Aberystwyth, and Builth, at each of which the ground plan had been determined and building started several months before his arrival. By the outbreak of the second Welsh war in March 1282, Rhuddlan was complete and the others well advanced. St George proceeded to Aberystwyth &#145;ad castrum regis ibidem construendum&#146;; in July 1282 he ordered the demolition of the old keep at Hope. Later, as James <i>machinator</i>, he was involved with works at Ruthin and Denbigh. In January 1283 he was at the siege of the castle of Dolwyddelan, whose nodal position made its capture crucial to the English conquest of Snowdonia.<br>
<br>The programme of castle building which St George now directed as &#145;master of the king's works in Wales&#146; marked the climax of his career. The castle and walled town of Conwy, adjudged together to be &#145;incomparably the most magnificent of Edward I's Welsh fortresses&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;Edward I's castle building&#146;, 38), were begun in March 1283 and virtually completed by late 1287. Harlech, started in May 1283, was finished in 1289. Caernarfon was begun in June, but not completed in St George's lifetime. With its polygonal towers and decorative banding in the imperial style of Constantinople, Caernarfon was envisaged as the state capital of a future dynasty of English princes of Wales, and was designed on an altogether grander scale than its contemporaries. Its creation has been attributed to Walter of Hereford, builder of Edward's abbey of Vale Royal, who took charge when construction was resumed after damage by the Welsh in 1294. Nowhere, however, is Walter named in connection with the initial, creative campaign of the 1280s, when Caernarfon was conceived as the visible embodiment of Macsen Wledig's dream of &#145;a mighty castle, the fairest man ever saw&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mabinogion</span>, 1.137). Realization of so special an assignment would surely be entrusted to the king's chief military architect.<br>
<br>In December 1280 St George was granted letters of protection for seven years, probably the estimated time for completing the works he took over in 1278. In 1284 his responsibility for the operations launched a year earlier was put on a permanent footing with the grant of 3<i>s</i>. a day for life and a future widow's pension of 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a day for his wife, Ambrosia, should she survive him. There is no further mention of Ambrosia in the records and possibly she is to be identified with the &#145;Dame Ambroise de Saint-Joire&#146; named in 1288 among the first entrants to the Carthusian nunnery of Melan (Haute-Savoie), founded in 1282 by Beatrice de Faucigny. St George himself was appointed in 1290 to the constableship of his newly completed Harlech Castle.<br>
<br>The defeat of the Welsh rising of 1294 led to the inception in 1295 of St George's last great commission, Beaumaris Castle in Anglesey, Britain's most perfect example of the concentric castle plan. The first eighteen months saw phenomenal progress, with a labour force of 3000 men, 400 of them masons, and expenditure of over &pound;10,000. Thereafter the more urgent demands of Gascony and Scotland reduced the average yearly outlay to a mere &pound;300. From 1298 to 1305 St George was with the king in Scotland, where he executed works at Linlithgow and Kildrummy castles; in 1304 he was probably directing engineer of the siege works at Stirling. He resumed work at Beaumaris in 1306 but died before May 1309.<br>
<br>On any reckoning St George's achievement in the field of medieval military architecture was outstanding. His was the genius that enabled Edward I to raise great fortresses by threes and fours in the space of five or six summers. Unstereotyped, of striking beauty and enduring strength, the north Wales castles have survived as a unique and lasting monument to their age and their creator.<br>
