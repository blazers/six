<span class="headword">Landseer,  Thomas</span>  (1793/4&#150;1880), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, was born at 71 Queen Anne Street, London, the eldest son of the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15986/', "John George Landseer (1762/3&#150;1852)")</script> and his wife, Jane Potts (1773/4&#150;1840), and was baptized, along with the other Landseer children, in the parish of St Marylebone on 23 May 1821. He was the eldest brother of seven surviving children who all displayed artistic talents and received their earliest general training from their father. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15984/', "Edwin Landseer (1802&#150;1873)")</script> was his youngest brother. With another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15983/', "Charles Landseer (1799/1800&#150;1879)")</script>, he went on to study under the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, when he was a fellow pupil of the young printmaker William Bewick (whose biography, <span class="italic">Life and Letters of William Bewick (Artist)</span>, he edited in 1871).<br>
<br>Having been taught various engraving techniques by his father, Thomas Landseer produced his first published print, <span class="italic">Study of the Head of a Sibyl</span> (1816), in a mixture of aquatint and etching after one of Haydon's drawings. He followed this in 1817 with a series of academic figure studies entitled <span class="italic">Haydon's Drawing-Book</span>, which he executed in soft-ground etching to emulate chalk drawing. Before this point he had etched a number of animal sketches, such as <span class="italic">A Bull Marked T. W.</span> (1811), after sketches by his youngest brother Edwin. Throughout his career he reproduced more than 125 of Edwin's heroic animal paintings in a blend of etching and engraving, which can be seen in plates such as the <span class="italic">Hunted Stag</span> (1848) or <span class="italic">Monarch of the Glen</span> (1852). This characteristic style of engraving effectively captured the textures and tones of his brother's originals, and Sir Edwin's financial success and popular acclaim owed much to Tom's reproductions, which were usually sold for between 3 and 10 guineas, depending on whether they were artist's proofs or finished prints. Although he engraved a number of sporting subjects and satirical vignettes to illustrate respectively texts such as <span class="italic">The Annals of Sporting and Fancy Gazette</span> (1822&#150;8) or Coleridge's <span class="italic">The Devil's Walk</span> (1831), Landseer always returned to animal subjects. Sometimes, as in the case of <span class="italic">Twenty Engravings of Lions, Tigers, Panthers &amp; Leopards</span> (1823), these were reproductions of ennobled prototypes by Rembrandt and Rubens; at other times he appealed to more scientific concerns with his <span class="italic">Characteristic Sketches of Animals</span> (1832), which was dedicated to the Zoological Society. He also exploited graphic traditions in <span class="italic">Monkeyana, or, Men in Miniature</span> (1827), where he depicted monkeys in fashionable dress, engaged in human activities, as a way of satirizing contemporary life. Landseer was also a painter, and between 1853 and 1877 he exhibited several landscape and genre paintings at both the British Institution and the Royal Academy. However, in 1867, when he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, it was for his talents as an engraver.<br>
<br>Surprisingly little is known of Thomas Landseer's private life or personality except that he was deaf, like his father, and was, according to his brother Edwin, rather dissolute and disorganized. He was the only one of his close family to marry, but the identity of his wife remains entirely unknown, probably as a result of her indiscretion. The nature of this was made clear in Haydon's diary when, in 1829, he mentioned that &#145;Tom Landseer &hellip; took back his wife after she had a child by another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, ed. Pope, 3.398). Though this reference casts doubt on the paternity of George Landseer (1829&#150;1878), Thomas brought him up as his own, and the boy followed in the family footsteps by becoming a portrait and a landscape painter. Towards the end of his life Landseer left his wife and moved in with his brother Charles and sister Jessie, at 11 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, where he died on 20 January 1880. He was buried at Highgate cemetery on 24 January, and his will, dated 28 April 1878, was read on 13 February. In it he left a fortune of around &pound;45,000 to his executors Thomas Hyde Hills and Arnold William White, as well as a bequest of &pound;5000 to the Artists' Orphan Fund and substantial legacies and annuities to various friends and family, including his sisters Jessie and Emma and the widow of his late son George.<br>
