<span class="headword">Mott, Sir  Frederick Walker</span>  (1853&#150;1926), <span class="occ">neuropathologist</span>, was born in Brighton on 23 October 1853, the only son of Henry Mott, of Brighton, Sussex, who was of Huguenot descent, and his wife, Caroline, daughter of William Fuller, of Pulborough, Sussex. Both parents died when he was a child. He studied medicine at University College, London, where he graduated MB, BSc in 1881 and MD in 1886, and obtained many distinctions. In 1883 he was appointed assistant professor of physiology at Liverpool University, but in the following year returned to London in order to take up the post of lecturer on physiology at Charing Cross Hospital medical school, where he became, in succession, lecturer on pathology, assistant physician, physician, and lecturer on medicine. In 1885 he married Georgina Alexandra, daughter of George Thomas Soley, shipowner, of Liverpool; they had four daughters. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1892 and fellow of the Royal Society in 1896.<br>
<br>Mott laid the foundation for his subsequent study of the diseases of the nervous system by researches into its normal structure and functions. Most of his earlier work was carried on in Edward Sharpey-Schafer's laboratory at University College, some of it in collaboration with other workers. These investigations included the paths of conduction in the spinal cord, localization in the cerebral cortex (especially relating to movements of the eyes), and the effect of acute anaemia on the brain. These studies were to have great influence on his later work.<br>
<br>In 1895 the London county council decided to appoint a pathologist in charge of the laboratory which it was proposing to establish at Claybury, Essex; all indications pointed to Mott as the most suitable occupant of the post. He stipulated, however, that he wanted to retain his clinical appointment at Charing Cross Hospital, considering it essential that the study of diseased conditions should be combined with clinical observation. The council agreed, and was therefore able to secure Mott's services for a long period of years, during which a vast amount of research work was carried out by him, his pupils, and assistants. Most of this is published in a series of important volumes as the <span class="italic">Archives of Neurology (and Psychiatry)</span>.<br>
<br>Subsequently, when the Maudsley Hospital for mental diseases was established at Denmark Hill, Mott's pathological work for the council was transferred to the newer and better-equipped laboratory attached to that institution, and was continued there until his final resignation from the position of pathologist to the London county council asylums in 1923, the age limit having been stretched in order that he might remain in the post as long as possible. But his activities were by no means at an end, as he continued to teach at the Maudsley Hospital, and also accepted the post of lecturer in morbid psychology at the University of Birmingham. He held this position up to the time of his death.<br>
<br>Besides the articles in the <span class="italic">Archives of Neurology</span>, Mott contributed numerous papers on the nervous system to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Royal Society, to <span class="italic">Brain</span>, to the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span>, to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine</span>, and to other scientific and medical periodicals.<br>
<br>Largely owing to Mott's researches it became established that the previously obscure disease of the nervous system known as &#145;general paralysis of the insane&#146; was, in fact, a manifestation of syphilis, and was associated with the presence of the specific spirochaete. The determination of the association between syphilitic infection and this and other mental disorders is the achievement by which Mott's name will probably be best known. But it was by no means his only important contribution to neuropathology; he further demonstrated the close relation between the nervous system and the sexual organs manifested in dementia praecox, as well as the association of deficient mental condition with degeneration of the thyroid and other endocrine organs.<br>
<br>As the result of these researches Mott firmly and insistently supported the view, which had previously been ignored, that mental disorders are, for the most part, correlated with bodily changes. Indeed, all his work tended to be based on this doctrine. Even in the disorder known as &#145;asylum dysentery&#146; the cause used to be attributed to a hypothetical nervous affection of the intestine, instead of to an infection associated with micro-organisms, which Mott showed to be its true cause. He wrote a report on his work concerning sleeping sickness, entitled <span class="italic">Histological Observations on Sleeping Sickness and other Trypanosome Infections</span>, which was published as no. 7 of the <span class="roman">Reports of the Sleeping Sickness Commission</span> of the Royal Society in December 1906.<br>
<br>Mott received numerous honours and prizes, as well as appointments to lecturerships, in recognition of his scientific work. He was awarded the Stewart prize of the Medical Association (1903), the Fothergill gold medal and prize of the Medical Society of London (1911), and the Moxon gold medal of the Royal College of Physicians (1919). He was Croonian lecturer (1900), Oliver-Sharpey lecturer (1910), Lettsomian lecturer (1916), and Harveian orator (1925) to the Royal College of Physicians, London, Morrison lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh (1921), Huxley lecturer at Charing Cross Hospital (1910), Bowman lecturer to the Ophthalmological Society (1904), and Fullerian lecturer at the Royal Institution. He delivered the Chadwick lecture at the University of Liverpool in 1917 and 1926. At the time of his death he was president of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association.<br>
<br>Mott, an accomplished singer, was devoted to music, especially to vocal music, and published two works. His interest in this was recognized by his election as president of the Society of English Singers in 1923. In 1919 he was created KBE in acknowledgement of his war services as lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps. His work on shell-shock was especially notable. In the same year he received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University. He was a good lecturer, always speaking to the point, and an honest investigator. Mott died in Birmingham General Hospital on 8 June 1926 as a result of cerebral haemorrhage, survived by his wife. A memorial volume, <span class="italic">Contributions to Psychiatry, Neurology and Sociology</span>, edited by J. R. Lord (1929), contains an appreciation of the man and his work by his lifelong friend, W. D. Halliburton, as well as a bibliography of his published writings.<br>
