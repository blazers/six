<span class="headword">Polier,  Antoine Louis Henri</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1795), <span class="occ">military engineer and collector of oriental manuscripts</span>, was baptized on 28 February 1741 at Lausanne, Switzerland, the younger son of Jacques Henri Polier (<i>bap</i>. 1700, <i>d</i>. 1781), of a French protestant family which had settled in Switzerland in the sixteenth century, and his wife, Jeanne Fran&ccedil;oise Moreau de Brosses, who was French. Polier was the nephew of Paul Philippe Polier (<i>bap</i>. 1711, <i>d</i>. 1759), sometime commandant of Fort St George in Madras, and he sailed for Madras on the <i>Hardwicke</i> in 1757, intending to join his uncle in that city, but instead joined the British East India Company service, as a cadet in the Madras army, and sought active service under Robert Clive against the French. He was transferred to Bengal in 1761, and was appointed lieutenant. In 1763 he attained the rank of captain, and acted as engineer in the construction of a new fort in Calcutta. He remained in this position until 1764 when he was superseded by Captain Fleming Martin, and himself became field engineer to the army under Major Hector Munro. In 1765 the court of directors permitted him to succeed Captain Martin as chief engineer and he acted in that capacity for two years. In 1766 he was promoted major, but could rise no higher because of a military order of that year which prohibited the promotion of foreigners to ranks higher than major.<br>
<br>In 1773, in response to a request from the nawab-wazir of Oudh, Shuja ud-Daula, Polier was asked to go to Oudh as engineer, surveyor, and architect. The following year he incurred the displeasure of a majority of the council for assisting Najaf Khan, the ambitious Mughal general who besieged the fort at Agra, which had fallen into the hands of the Jats. The council was incensed to find that Polier had exceeded his brief by accepting the command of a contingent of the nawab's troops which had been dispatched to assist Najaf Khan at Agra. Polier was subsequently recalled to the Bengal presidency, and the court of directors ordered him to resign in 1775. He returned to Oudh to settle his commercial affairs, through which he had amassed considerable wealth, and in 1776 took up service with the Mughal emperor Shah Alam, raising a contingent of troopers and receiving a <i>jagir</i> (an assignment of land revenue) in the district of Agra. In May 1780 Polier informed the governor-general that he had been appointed by the nawab-wazir to his former position of architect and engineer. The court of directors agreed to this appointment, and in 1782 he was readmitted to the service of the East India Company with the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Polier maintained a fully-fledged household in Fyzabad, under the care of his trusted servant Lal Khan. It contained his two Indian wives, identified in his Persian correspondence as the &#145;senior&#146; and &#145;junior&#146; wives, and his sons by them. In addition, Colonel Claude Martin's will identified two other Indian women as &#145;women of Polier&#146;, Johquenow Begam and Zinnet Begam, and left them each a pension of 10 <i>sicca</i> rupees per month. During his time at Oudh, Polier collected oriental manuscripts and miniatures, and maintained a fascinatingly rich library of oriental manuscripts in Lucknow. More than 550 of these manuscripts were bought by the British civil servant E. E. Pote, who donated them to King's College, Cambridge, and to Eton College. Other parts of Polier's collections eventually found their way into the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris and the British Library in London. The Biblioth&egrave;que Cantonale, Lausanne, has a manuscript catalogue of 120 oriental works with annotations by Polier.<br>
<br>In 1789 Polier returned to Europe, and on 20 January 1791 he married Anne Rose Louis Bertthoudt, daughter of Jacob, Baron Van Berchem, in France. They had two sons, Georges Maximin Jacques Henri (1793&#150;1842) and Pierre Amed&eacute;e Charles Guillaume, who became comte de Polier. Antoine Polier bought property near Avignon, and settled there. He was pensioned on Lord Clive's fund on 14 March 1792. He was killed by robbers at his home near Avignon.<br>
<br>The life of Antoine Polier adds new dimensions to the understanding of the making of early colonial India. His activities highlight the extent to which the British relied on the co-operation of the French, even in an era of heightened Anglo-French conflict. Polier supervised the East India Company's survey and commercial operations, supplied his friend Warren Hastings with information on the political plans of indigenous rulers, and wrote the histories of the Sikhs and the Jats. Thus he actively aided the company's project of understanding the people and politics of India, which was vital to the stability of early British rule. Finally, Polier's collections and writings, and his Persian and English correspondence, enable the reader to view the Orient through the eyes of an eighteenth-century Frenchman, bringing a different perspective to understanding and interpretation of India.<br>
