<span class="headword">Hoadly,  John</span>  (1678&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born at Tottenham, Middlesex, on 27 September 1678, son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13378/', "Revd Samuel Hoadly (1643&#150;1705)")</script> and his second wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pickering (1639&#150;1703); his elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13375/', "Benjamin Hoadly (1676&#150;1761)")</script>. He was educated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1697. In September 1700 he was appointed deputy headmaster of Norwich grammar school, of which his father was headmaster. Having passed some years there he became chaplain to Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who preferred him to the rectory of St Edmund's, Salisbury, and made him successively prebendary (21 February 1706), archdeacon (6 November 1710), and chancellor (16 April 1713) of that diocese. In 1717 Lord King, then chief justice of the common pleas, presented him to the rectory of Ockham in Surrey. He was also appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to George II.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1727 Hoadly was consecrated bishop of Ferns and Leighlin. William Whiston violently objected to this appointment on account of Hoadly's standard of learning. Others were more complimentary about his accomplishments: &#145;I know&#146;, wrote the primate, Archbishop Hugh Boulter, &#145;his affection for his majesty, and that he has spirit to help to keep up the English interest here.&#146; In July 1729, when the archbishopric of Dublin fell vacant, Boulter again wrote of Hoadly's loyalty to the crown, this time to Sir Robert Walpole. Hoadly was accordingly translated to Dublin on 13 January 1730. When Boulter died, Hoadly was chosen to succeed him as primate and was appointed on 7 October 1742.<br>
<br>As primate Hoadly displayed a tolerant spirit by consenting to the abolition of restrictions on Roman Catholic services. As archbishop of Dublin he built the residence of Tallaght, co. Dublin, at a cost of &pound;2500. Unlike his brother, Hoadly was not a prolific theological writer. His few publications included several sermons, a pastoral letter on the Jacobite rising of 1745, a defence of Gilbert Burnet, and a commentary on the work of Bishop William Beveridge of St Asaph. Details of Hoadly's marriage are unknown but his only daughter, Sarah, married Bellingham Boyle, MP for Bandon Bridge (1731&#150;60) and for Youghal (1761&#150;8).<br>
<br>Hoadly was for many years influential in managing the Irish privy council and the House of Lords, especially after his appointment as a lord justice on 25 November 1742. He died at Rathfarnham on 16 July 1746, of a fever caught while superintending workmen, and was buried at Tallaght. &#145;He gave universal content and satisfaction&#146;, said a writer in the <span class="italic">Dublin Courant</span> (22 July 1746) &#145;by his easiness of access, his knowledge of affairs, and capacity for business&#146;.<br>
