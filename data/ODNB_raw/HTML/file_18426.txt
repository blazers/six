<span class="headword">Mayart, Sir  Samuel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1587, <em>d.</em> in or after 1646), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Gilbert Mayart of Ipswich (<i>d</i>. in or before 1607) and was of Flemish extraction. He matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 18 May 1604 and entered the Middle Temple on 16 February 1607, being called to the bar on 8 July 1614. He was admitted to King's Inns, Dublin, in 1616. In 1624 he was reported to have offered &pound;300 to secure the place of second justice of the common pleas in Ireland. Chief Baron Sir Richard Bolton, and his son Sir Edward, solicitor-general, &#145;strongly&#146; recommended the appointment of this &#145;man of learning and honesty&#146;, despite the fact that &#145;aspersions are being cast upon him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1625&#150;33</i>, 18). Mayart received a patent for the office on 19 January 1626. He was knighted on 5 November 1631 and lived at Oxmantown, Dublin. He was named treasurer of King's Inns in 1633.<br>
<br>In April 1644 the Irish parliament took notice of an anonymous treatise &#145;A declaration how and by what means the laws and statutes of England &hellip; came to be of force in Ireland&#146;, sometimes attributed to Sir Richard Bolton. Mayart was involved in the discussion of the document and appears to have drawn up a manuscript response, approximately five times the length of the original text. Drawing heavily upon legal records stretching back over several centuries he sought to reject the notion that English made law was only valid in Ireland upon re-enactment by the Irish parliament. He was confident that &#145;in divers respects <i>Ireland</i> is a separate and distinct kingdom, &hellip; yet the Dominion and Government thereof is not separate from <i>England</i>&#146;  (Harris, 2.127) but rather that Ireland was under the jurisdiction of the English parliament. Though his case was based firmly upon precedent he admitted that he believed the recent rising had shown the &#145;inconveniency, mischief and prejudice&#146;  (Harris, 1.73) that would result if curbs were not placed upon Irish autonomy. It is unclear what response the document generated, though its arguments were addressed by Sir William Domville in 1660. The manuscript was published in <span class="italic">Hibernica</span>, a collection of sources on Irish history edited by Walter Harris under the title &#145;Serjeant Mayart's Answer to a Book Intitled, A Declaration&#146;. The manuscript was presented to Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
<br>Despite the fact that Mayart's stance on the powers of the Irish parliament was out of step with the Dublin royalist political establishment he was among the legal figures consulted by Ormond during the lord lieutenant's negotiations with the confederate Catholics in 1645. He continued to fulfil his functions in the Irish parliament, being recorded there as late as February 1646. Little is known of his family&#151;he is sometimes reported as having married thrice, although the name of his first wife is unknown; his second wife, Mary Smith (<i>d</i>. in or before 1631?), was twice a widow already. In 1631, and again in 1638, his wife's name is given as Dorcas (<i>d</i>. 1644?), on the latter occasion the name also given to their daughter, baptized on 9 January 1638. He had at least one other daughter, Letice (<i>d</i>. 1641), and a son, Roger (<i>d</i>. 1668). He is last heard of in 1646 and his date of death is unknown.<br>
