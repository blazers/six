<span class="headword">Shackleton,  Abraham</span>  (1696&#150;1771), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born on 27 October 1696 into a family of yeoman farmers, at Shackleton House, Harden, near Bingley, Yorkshire, the youngest of the six children of Richard Shackleton (1643&#150;1705) and his wife, Sarah Brigg (1658&#150;1703) of Keighley. His father, the first of the family to become a Friend, had suffered three years' imprisonment at York Castle for non-attendance at church, and the family home, Shackleton House, became a registered Quaker meeting-house in the year that Abraham was born.<br>
<br>Abraham's parents both died before he was nine, and at the age of twenty he sold his share of the family inheritance to his brother Roger (1691&#150;1766) and took to studying Latin, duly becoming a good prose stylist. He then taught at David Hall's school at Skipton, Yorkshire, and on 7 October 1725 he married Margaret Wilkinson (1688&#150;1768) of Knowlbank, a first cousin of his employer. In 1720 he moved to Ireland and became tutor to the children of two Quaker landowners, John Duckett of Duckett's Grove, co. Carlow, and William Cooper of nearby Cooper's Hill, Queen's county. With their encouragement he established, in 1726, a boarding-school for boys in the tree-lined, Quaker village of Ballitore, co. Kildare. The school was multi-denominational and took both native Irish and Anglo-Irish pupils alike, with a sprinkling from France, Scandinavia, and further afield. He was an extremely diligent and careful teacher, strong on fatherly oversight, and always set a good example of uprightness, temperance, and humility. Because of him Quakerism came to be better understood in Ireland and the Quakers admired. His most famous pupil was the statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke.<br>
<br>Shackleton retired in 1756, having educated over 500 boys in 30 years, and occupied himself with farming and occasional religious journeys, such as travelling around Ireland with Joseph Oxley in 1762 and to the yearly meeting of Friends in London in 1769 (when he also visited Burke at Beaconsfield). He died on 24 June 1771 at Ballitore, where he was interred in the Quaker burial-ground. Burke said of him that &#145;He was indeed a man of singular piety, rectitude and virtue and he had, along with these qualities, a native elegance of manners which nothing but genuine good nature and unaffected simplicity of heart can give&#146;  (Leadbeater, <span class="italic">Memoirs and Letters</span>, 98). He left one son, <a href="#cosubject_25187">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and one daughter, Elizabeth Raynor.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25187"></a><span class="headword">Richard Shackleton</span>  (1726&#150;1792), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and poet</span>, was born at Ballitore on 9 December 1726. He studied Hebrew and the classics, and became one of the leading Quaker scholars of his day. Educated at his father's school and Trinity College, Dublin, he subsequently taught at Ballitore School and was its master from 1756 to 1779. His cheerful, affectionate disposition opened his way with all ranks, and he became a lifelong friend of Edmund Burke, his contemporary at school and university. Sixty-four letters from Burke to him are printed in <span class="italic">The Leadbeater Papers</span> in a correspondence characterized by wit and by philosophical and moral discussion.<br>
<br>Shackleton greatly relished meeting such men as George Crabbe and Joshua Reynolds in Burke's circle; however, he kept his own worldly ambitions firmly under control. He lived a quiet, virtuous life, became a Quaker elder, and although not a minister he promoted Friends' principles in the school by his example, and through his correspondence greatly encouraged those who were in the ministry. He was a warm, compassionate man who practised daily spiritual retirement, seeking salvation through self-denial and humility. Burke said of him that &#145;No life was better &hellip; [or] more happily spent than his&#146;  (Leadbeater, <span class="italic">Papers</span>, 1.201). He was twice married: his first wife, whom he married on 2 April 1749, was Elizabeth Fuller (1726&#150;1754), with whom he had four children and lived at Fuller's Court in Ballitore. She died on 19 May 1754 and on 17 October in the following year he married Elizabeth Carleton (1726&#150;1804). They first lived at the school, then at Griesebank, and finally at The Retreat, in Ballitore.<br>
<br>In 1767 Shackleton inherited a small estate, with a farm, which was successfully operated by his wife, and a mill, which he rented. In 1779 he was succeeded as master of Ballitore School by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68181/', "Abraham Shackleton (1752&#150;1818)")</script>, and thereafter he travelled frequently in Quaker service in Ireland and in England; there he often spent the summer months, attending London yearly meeting and visiting such friends as Burke and the industrialist Abiah Darby, for whom he wrote the poem &#145;On Travelling to Coalbrook Dale in the Night-Time&#146;, in both Latin and English versions, in 1783. With his second wife he had four children, including the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16232/', "Mary Leadbeater (1758&#150;1826)")</script>, in whose <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1808) appear seven short compositions by her father. He was a round-faced man, whose portrait, commissioned by Burke, was painted in 1766 by Richard Sisson. He died of a fever, on 28 August 1792, while visiting Mountmellick, Queen's county, and was buried on 30 August in the Quaker burial-ground, Ballitore.<br>
