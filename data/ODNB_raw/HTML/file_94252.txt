    (Bess of Hardwick; 1527?&#150;1608)
  . Queen Elizabeth, her godmother, named her Aletheia to signify &#145;veritie&#146; or &#145;truth&#146;. The deaths in infancy of her two brothers made Aletheia and her two sisters, Mary Herbert, countess of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1650), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11530/', "Elizabeth Grey, countess of Kent (1582&#150;1651)")</script>, the joint heirs to three of their father's titles and much of the great family estate.<br>
<br>A devout Roman Catholic throughout her life&#151;an allegiance that she nurtured in her children and grandchildren&#151;in September 1606 Aletheia married a member of England's premier Catholic family, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13943/', "Thomas Howard, fourteenth earl of Arundel and fourth earl of Surrey (1585&#150;1646)")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13929/', "Philip Howard, thirteenth earl of Arundel (1557&#150;1595)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46907/', "Anne Howard, countess of Arundel (1557&#150;1630)")</script>. Through the influence of her cultured parents and grandmother Lady Arundel came to her marriage with knowledge of architecture, patronage, and collecting. In 1608 the couple moved to Arundel House in London and were prominent at the court of King James and Queen Anne. Lady Arundel acted in many court masques, including Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Masque of Beauty</span> (1608) and <span class="italic">Masque of Queens</span> (1609) and as the River Arun in Samuel Daniel's <span class="italic">Tethys' Festival, or, The Queen's Wake</span> (1610). The couple had six sons, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Lady Arundel enjoyed her first adventure abroad in June 1613, when she and her husband escorted the newly wed couple Princess Elizabeth and Frederick, the elector palatine, to Heidelberg. Rather than return directly to England, the Arundels moved on to Italy, and that winter spent six weeks studying Italian in a monastery near Siena. Their party included Inigo Jones, whose ability to speak Italian made him a significant asset, and their travels together marked the beginning of a lifelong friendship. After a year and seven months of absence the Arundels returned to England in November 1614. In the years following, while Lord Arundel was occupied with political obligations, Lady Arundel maintained a high profile in court. She supervised Inigo Jones's architectural renovations on Arundel House and hosted elaborate social gatherings, such as a dinner for the Florentine ambassador, which displayed her immersion in Italian culture. Her souvenir gondola, Venetian maid servants, and Italianate banquets with their multi-layered tablecloths all caused much excitement among her guests. A contemporary account of the queen's banquet for Pietro Contarini, the Venetian ambassador in England, held in August 1618, noted that she was &#145;the chief lady of the court and kingdom, no other taking precedence of her either for descent, or in the Queen's favour&#146; and added that she retained a partiality for &#145;the city and aristocracy of Venice where she received much favour and courtesy a few years ago&#146;  (Hervey, 141). Her pre-eminent position at court was confirmed at Queen Anne's funeral in May 1619, when she acted as chief mourner.<br>
<br>In June 1620 Lady Arundel set off without her husband for Padua, where her two elder sons had gone the previous year to study. Her self-sufficiency in foreign travel was one of the most remarkable aspects of her independent character and she occupied herself for two years in Padua and Venice corresponding with artists and acting autonomously as an art patron and collector. Soprani's description of her as a &#145;Dama molto amante di Pittura&#146;  (Hervey, 200) pays testament to her engagement with Italian art. She had already stopped in Antwerp on her way to Italy, and sat for Peter Paul Rubens to paint her portrait. Tizianello, a relative of the artist Titian, dedicated his <span class="italic">Breve compendio della vita del famoso Titiano Vecellio de Cadore</span> (1622) to Lady Arundel. Intending to commission more paintings, Lady Arundel tried to arrange for Tizianello to return to England with her, but this agreement did not materialize. Anthony Van Dyck was probably part of her circle in Venice and even part of her entourage during her travels.<br>
<br>Lady Arundel's audacious spirit is best captured in April 1622 when she was falsely implicated in allegations of treason. The previous Venetian ambassador to England, Antonio Foscarini, was accused of privately meeting with foreigners and conferring state secrets. He was strangled in prison and his body was hung in the piazza San Marco. Sir Henry Wotton, English ambassador at Venice, warned Lady Arundel that the senate suspected Foscarini had held some of his clandestine meetings at her house on the Grand Canal and that they intended to expel her within three days. Wotton encouraged her to leave immediately, but the accusations deeply angered Lady Arundel and she insisted on reporting before the Venetian cabinet. An audience was called for her the following morning and she delivered her case before the doge. He declared the accusations untrue, and vowed to punish anyone involved in spreading these slanderous remarks. Shortly afterwards, Lady Arundel's innocence was publicly displayed when she was given a gallery at the national festival for accession day and was escorted to the event by two government officials. Public banquets were also held in her honour at Murano and on the Lido.<br>
<br>In late September 1622 Lady Arundel left Venice with her two sons to begin her return to England. Her eccentric response to the accusations of treason and her extensive travels abroad without her husband supplied substance for rumours that began circulating in London. Yet instead of heading directly back to England to dispel the attacks on her reputation, Lady Arundel spent many months in Turin and Genoa. She probably stalled in the hope of being conveniently placed to escort the Spanish infanta to England for her proposed marriage to Prince Charles. In April 1623, after the anticipated marriage was vetoed, Lady Arundel set out for The Hague to visit Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, stopping in Mantua to negotiate an art purchase with Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga of Mantua on behalf of Prince Charles. The group had not yet reached The Hague when in July Lady Arundel's eldest son, James, died suddenly of smallpox. The tragic news caused Lord Arundel to join her abroad and in September 1623 the couple finally returned to England together, concluding Lady Arundel's three years of travel.<br>
<br>From almost immediately after Charles I's coronation in February 1626, the intense relationship between the king and George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, caused hardships for the Arundels. The first instance of their troubles occurred when their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13915/', "Henry Frederick Howard, Lord Maltravers")</script>, secretly married Lady Elizabeth Stuart, whom the king had intended for Lord Lorne. Hoping to explain his innocence, Lord Arundel went immediately to Charles but the king still punished the family, sending Lord Arundel to the Tower and confining Lady Arundel to her mother-in-law's house at Horsley, Surrey. The birth of their grandson in March 1627 allowed them the freedom to return to London but they had to stay confined to Arundel House. It was not until a meeting of parliament in March 1628 that their punishment was fully lifted. After Buckingham's assassination the Arundels slowly regained their favour at court. Lady Arundel cultivated a friendship with Queen Henrietta Maria and the royal couple visited Arundel House in December 1628, touring every room to view their collections.<br>
<br>In 1633 the Arundels purchased Tart Hall, a villa on the west edge of St James's Park, and for the rest of the decade Lady Arundel supervised its architectural renovation. Inspired by the architecture she had seen in Venice and Padua, she paid Nicholas Stone to produce a building embodying a hybrid of English and Italian design. For the remainder of her time in England the house became Lady Arundel's favourite and was where she displayed her personal art collections, entertained her Catholic circle, and invited priests to dine with her. It was at Tart Hall that in March 1637 Lady Arundel received George Conn, the Italian papal agent in England. The two played chess and engaged in a four-hour discussion of possible Catholic modifications to the oath of allegiance, a highly contentious contemporary debate. Conn later wrote of his obligation to act as Lady Arundel's confessor, noting that she was &#145;most charming&#146; and &#145;Catholic in all but outward profession&#146;  (Hervey, 398, 399). Her social skills had also been deployed the previous year when she tried acting as mediator in a dispute between her husband and the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Thomas Wentworth, over Lord Arundel's attempt to recover Irish possessions once owned by his grandfather.<br>
<br>It is likely that it was Lady Arundel who initiated the revival of the scheme to colonize Madagascar, which originally involved the conversion to Catholicism of its proposed leader, Prince Rupert. In 1639 the Arundels revived what proved a popular scheme, and the last months of the year were spent preparing ships and enlisting volunteers. Van Dyck's impressive portrait of the couple known as the &#145;Madagascar portrait&#146; was probably painted in 1639 or 1640. It shows Lord Arundel pointing to Madagascar on a globe with Lady Arundel sitting at his side holding navigation instruments. It is unclear why the two did not embark on this journey, although Lord Arundel's ill health provides a plausible explanation.<br>
<br>Lady Arundel helped to promote and finance the commercial development of Lincoln's Inn Fields at the beginning of the 1640s, although the outbreak of the civil war put a premature stop to this endeavour. In 1641 Charles appointed the Arundels to escort the queen's mother, Maria de' Medici, abroad. Frustrated when the latter delayed, Lady Arundel left early for the Netherlands in the company of her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13948/', "William Howard, Viscount Stafford")</script>, and his wife, and of three of the children of her eldest son. She continued to live in Amsterdam after Lord Arundel left England with the queen and settled in Italy. The reason for their living apart in exile remains unclear, as no letter between the two is extant from this period. In June 1644 Lord Arundel was created earl of Norfolk, making Lady Arundel countess of Arundel, of Surrey, and of Norfolk. Lady Arundel was not with her husband when he died in Padua on 4 October 1646 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> and a bitter family argument erupted when her son, Henry Frederick, then fifteenth earl of Arundel, appears to have personally executed his father's will and usurped properties that should have passed to his mother.<br>
<br>Throughout her fourteen years of exile Lady Arundel maintained an art collection in her Amsterdam house and retained a circle of intellectuals and artists including Sir Edward Walker and Hendrick van der Borcht the younger. Francis Junius, the Arundels' librarian, frequented Lady Arundel's Amsterdam home and recorded that she &#145;carried over a vast treasure of rarities&#146; and that &#145;Shee caused mee to sett her librarie in some order, and to make a catalogue of all the books that were in it&#146;  (Levy Peck, 7). She continued to finance Tart Hall and in 1652 even planned a return there. Following the deaths of her childless sisters, Mary in 1650 and Elizabeth on 7 December 1651, Lady Arundel inherited the baronies of Furnivall, Talbot, and Strange of Blackmere. She died in Amsterdam on 3 June 1654 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> but was buried in Rotherham, Yorkshire. The issue of who would inherit her properties and collections was disputed between her only surviving son, Viscount Stafford, and her grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13907/', "Henry Howard, later sixth duke of Norfolk")</script>, a dispute that required an admonition as late as 1714. An inventory of her remaining collections was therefore taken in 1655, but it lists only a fraction of the items known to have been in them. The same year a sophisticated book of domestic science entitled <span class="italic">Natura exenterata</span> was published bearing a copy of Lady Arundel's portrait on the flyleaf. There is little information to confirm Lady Arundel's actual participation in the compilation of this recipe book, but some of her contemporaries, including Samuel Hartlib, attributed it to her.<br>
