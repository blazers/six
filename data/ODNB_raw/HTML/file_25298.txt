<span class="headword">Sheffield,  John</span>  (1653/4&#150;1726), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Ibstock, Leicestershire, the son of William Sheffield (<i>d</i>. 1673), who was rector at Ibstock from 1644 to 1662. After attending Kibworth grammar school John Sheffield was sent to learn a trade, but he was eager to enter the ministry and began to study under John Shuttlewood, ejected clergyman and in the 1660s an itinerant preacher in Leicestershire, accompanying him from one hiding place to the next. In December 1668 Shuttlewood, Sheffield, and others were surprised at a conventicle. The next day Sheffield was required by the local magistrate to state &#145;when he had been at his parish church to hear Divine Service&#146; and whether he would go next Sunday, but &#145;answered that he did not know how Divine Providence might dispose of him before that time&#146;  (Pearse, 79). He was sent to Leicester gaol in the custody of Charles Gibbons, quartermaster of the trained bands. In 1672 an attempt was made to distrain his goods, despite his possession of a licence. In 1674 Sheffield was living at Lubenham, Leicestershire, where he was visited by his old friend Gibbons, &#145;roaring into his congregation after his wonted manner&#146;; a warrant was secured &#145;to distrain upon Mr Sh for forty pounds: And the officers took away seven milch cows of Mr Sheffields&#146; which were sold for &pound;7 and the proceeds paid to the justices  (ibid., 81). Eventually Sheffield found a position as chaplain to Mrs Palmer at Temple Hall, in the parish of Sibson, Leicestershire. There he married; although his wife's name is unknown, they had at least two daughters, Letitia and Lydia, and two sons, Nathaniel, a lawyer, and the eldest child, William, born in 1682, who became a dissenting minister at Buckingham, Windsor, and later Haverhill, Suffolk.<br>
<br>On 27 September 1682 Sheffield was ordained by Shuttlewood and three other ejected ministers. Two meeting-houses were built for him, probably in 1689, at Temple Hall and at Atherstone, Warwickshire, where he had also begun preaching. In the early 1690s he was granted &pound;4 a year for his pastoral work at Appleby, Leicestershire, by the managers of the Common Fund of Presbyterian and Independent ministers, and continued to receive this support until 1703. He himself was elected to serve as a fund manager in 1697. Also in that year, he succeeded as minister of the Presbyterian congregation in St Thomas Street, Southwark. He was a friend of the philosopher John Locke, whom he visited at Oates, near High Laver. In the Salters' Hall debates of 1719 he sided with the non-subscribers. In March 1720, when his son Nathaniel was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple, John Sheffield was given as resident of Queen Street, Southwark. Despite his earlier stormy relationships with the authorities, Sheffield has been described as akin to Richard Baxter in his views. According to Calamy:<blockquote>He was much for catholic Christianity: and therefore did he the less relish the National Establishment, and therefore was he the more contented to renounce the emoluments of it, because he thought it set up such a sort of uniformity as hindered unity, and turned the national church into a mere party. (Calamy, 37)</blockquote>Judging from Calamy's gruesome account of the results of the autopsy, Sheffield must have spent his last years in agony, eventually succumbing to stone of the bladder and kidneys on 24 January 1726, aged seventy-two. He probably died in Southwark.<br>
