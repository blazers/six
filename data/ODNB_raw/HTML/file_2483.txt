<span class="headword">Bisset,  Robert</span>  (1758/9&#150;1805), <span class="occ">historian and novelist</span>, was one of the leading anti-Jacobin writers during the era of the French Revolution. Little is known of his life beyond his published works. His first production, appearing in 1793&#150;4 (with a second edition in 1799), was a new edition of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, to which he prefixed biographies of the authors. In 1796 he graduated as doctor of laws from the University of Edinburgh, and in the same year he published a <span class="italic">Sketch of Democracy</span>, the aim of which was to show, by a survey of the democratic states of ancient times, that democracy is a vicious form of government. His next work, <span class="italic">The Life of Edmund Burke</span> (1798; 2nd edn, 1800), was well received, but his militantly conservative sentiments are most evident in his many contributions to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>. Over the period 1798 to 1800 Bisset produced more articles for that magazine than anyone save its editor, John Gifford. He has been called the <span class="italic">Review</span>'s &#145;pacesetter&#146;  (de Montluzin, 58), and as such Bisset has a strong claim to be thought of as having set the standard for the whole loyalist campaign of the 1790s and early 1800s.<br>
<br>Bisset edited the short-lived <span class="italic">Historical, Biographical, Literary, and Scientific Magazine</span> in 1799, and then produced two vociferously anti-Jacobin novels, <span class="italic">Douglas, or, The Highlander</span> (1800) and <span class="italic">Modern Literature</span> (1804). His chief targets here, as well as avowedly radical writers such as Thomas Paine, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, were contemporary novelists who, in Bisset's opinion, undermined the morals, piety, and loyalty of an all too susceptible readership. Also in 1804 Bisset published, in six volumes, <span class="italic">A History of the Reign of George the Third, to the Termination of the Late War</span>, to which he prefixed &#145;a view of the progressive improvement of England, in prosperity and strength, to the accession of his Majesty&#146;. (Volume 7 was written by the miscellaneous author Ralph Rylance and published anonymously in 1820.) The work was generally praised and, surprisingly, was applauded for its impartiality. Three pamphlets are attributed to Bisset by manuscript notes in the British Library copies: <span class="italic">A Defence of the Slave Trade</span> (1804), <span class="italic">A Plain Reply to the Pamphlet calling itself &#145;A Plain Answer&#146;</span> (1804), and <span class="italic">Essays on the Slave Trade</span> (1805). By 1796 he was living in Chelsea, and at the time of his death in 1805 at the age of forty-six he was master of an academy in Sloane Street. His death, at his home in Sloane Terrace, is said to have been caused by &#145;chagrin under embarrassed circumstances&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
