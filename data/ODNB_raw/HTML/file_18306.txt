</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Massinger,  Philip</span>  (1583&#150;1640), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born in November 1583, probably in Salisbury, and baptized at St Thomas's, Salisbury, on 24 November 1583. He was the son of Arthur Massinger (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1603), fellow of Merton College, Oxford, MP, general agent for the earls of Pembroke, and examiner to the council in the marches of Wales, and of Anne Crompton (<i>d</i>. in or after 1614), whose father was a merchant of Stafford and London. According to John Aubrey, Philip Massinger was married and his widow, who lived and died in Cardiff, continued to receive from the earl of Pembroke and Montgomery a pension formerly paid to her husband. Nothing further is known of the marriage.<br>
<br>Massinger went up to St Alban Hall, Oxford, in 1601 or 1602. Gerard Langbaine and Anthony Wood credit him with three or four years at Oxford&#151;studying hard, says Langbaine; sidetracked by poetry and romances, says Wood&#151;but he left without a degree so his departure probably occurred sooner than that, perhaps at about the time of his father's death in 1603. Conceivably he became an actor; in his poem &#145;The Copy of a Letter&#146; (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1620) he speaks of not being &#145;knowne beyond A Player or A Man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.390). But nothing certain is known about Massinger's activities from his arrival in Oxford until (probably) 1613, when, with his fellow playwrights Nathan Field and Robert Daborne, he wrote from the Clink prison to ask Philip Henslowe for &pound;5 that was owed to them for an unidentified play. (By 1629, when Massinger apparently owed Field's brother Nathaniel &pound;60, his credit must in some respects have improved.)<br>
<br>Another area of some uncertainty is Massinger's religious affiliation; a tradition grew up in the nineteenth century that he was a Roman Catholic. There is no strong evidence for this; the tradition was based mainly on the presence of Catholic characters and contexts in two of his plays with Mediterranean settings&#151;<span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span> and <span class="italic">The Renegado</span>&#151;and a third, <span class="italic">The Virgin Martyr</span>, which was set at the time of the early church. Perhaps more significantly it is known that Massinger's uncle Anthony Crompton was a recusant in the 1580s and that another uncle, Thomas Crompton, was suspected of being a Catholic although he later became chancellor of the diocese of London and vicar-general for the archbishop of Canterbury. Massinger also had a number of Catholic friends or associates, including Sir Aston Cokayne and the playwright James Shirley, but this in itself proves little.<h2>
<a name="Collaborations"></a>Collaborations</h2>Writing collaborative drama was Massinger's principal occupation between 1613 (or before) and the early 1620s. There has been a strong measure of agreement among scholars as to his share in these works. About 1613 he is believed to have contributed part of act <span class="smallcap">III</span> of <span class="italic">The Honest Man's Fortune</span>, which was written mainly by Nathan Field and John Fletcher. He is given a more substantial role in his other collaborations with Field and Fletcher of about 1616&#150;18 (<span class="italic">The Knight of Malta</span>, <span class="italic">The Queen of Corinth</span>, and the lost <span class="italic">Jeweller of Amsterdam</span>); with Field alone (<span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>, 1616&#150;18?); with Thomas Dekker (<span class="italic">The Virgin Martyr</span>, probably 1620); and in the series of plays written with Fletcher mostly between about 1618 and 1623. Often Massinger writes the opening and closing scene (or sometimes the whole of act <span class="smallcap">I</span> and act <span class="smallcap">V</span>); partly as a result his share contains a somewhat higher percentage than his partners' of expository, rhetorical, and forensic material and a lower percentage of comic material. (One of his best early opportunities for forensic oratory occurs in the judicial and quasi-judicial scenes of <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>.)<br>
<br>The collaboration between Fletcher and Massinger was at its height about 1619&#150;22 and included such plays as <span class="italic">The Custom of the Country</span> (<i>c</i>.1619&#150;1620), <span class="italic">The Double Marriage</span> (<i>c</i>.1621), <span class="italic">The False one</span> (1620?), <span class="italic">The Prophetess</span> (licensed 14 May 1622), and <span class="italic">The Spanish Curate</span> (licensed 24 October 1622). Almost all the Fletcher/Massinger pieces are either comedies or tragicomedies in the tradition established earlier by Fletcher and Francis Beaumont. In the summer of 1619, however, they produced the controversially topical <span class="italic">Tragedy of Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt</span>, concerning the fall of the Dutch statesman and opponent of Prince Maurice. Barnavelt was executed on 3 May and the play was ready for performance by the King's Men by mid-August when, as Thomas Locke wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton, they &#145;at th' instant were prohibited by&#146; the bishop of London  (Bentley, 3.415). (This is the first of several known instances when a Massinger play encountered censorship problems.) Somehow, Locke reports on 27 August, &#145;Our players have fownd the meanes to goe through with the play of Barnavelt, and it hath had many spectators and receaved applause&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>How Massinger and others regarded his collaborative work is largely uncertain. The &#145;toyes I would not father&#146; in &#145;The Copy of a Letter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.390) probably refers to such work but could, of course, be disingenuous or could, since the poem may date from as early as 1615, predate prestigious co-operation with Field and Fletcher, the leading actor and leading playwright of the day. (According to Sir Aston Cokayne in <span class="italic">A Chain of Golden Poems</span> (1658), Massinger and Fletcher were &#145;great friends&#146; as well as collaborators  (p. 186).) It seems likely that at the time Massinger's role in the plays was known and even celebrated; in 1620, before any recorded non-collaborative work, John Taylor, the &#145;water poet&#146;, lists him among the best-known playwrights in <span class="italic">The Praise of Hemp-Seed</span>. And clearly even after Fletcher's death in 1625 Massinger continued to engage with their joint work; it is evident that in a number of plays datable in their original form to 1622 and after his role is that of reviser. This is almost certainly the case, for instance, in two plays performed in 1634: <span class="italic">Cleander</span>, a revision of Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Lovers' Progress</span>, and <span class="italic">A Very Woman</span>. Several of the plays, moreover, continued to flourish on stage during Massinger's later career. As Fletcher's original joint-author, reviser, or both Massinger worked, in addition to plays already mentioned, on <span class="italic">The Little French Lawyer</span> (1619&#150;23), <span class="italic">The Sea Voyage</span> (1622), <span class="italic">The Elder Brother</span> (1625?), and <span class="italic">Love's Cure</span> (1625?). He may also, less certainly, have had some role in <span class="italic">Beggars' Bush</span> (1615&#150;22) and a revised version of <span class="italic">Thierry and Theodoret</span> (before 1621).<br>
<br>The work with Fletcher and others may, then, have contributed much to Massinger's earnings and renown. This fact&#151;to the detriment of his reputation during the later seventeenth and eighteenth century in particular&#151;was subsequently obscured by the complete omission of his name from the Beaumont and Fletcher folios of 1647 and 1679. Only Massinger's friend Cokayne is known to have protested about this state of affairs, and then chiefly out of concern for Fletcher's honour:<blockquote>
<div>In the large book of Playes you late did print<br>
</div>
<div>(In <i>Beaumonts</i> and in <i>Fletchers</i> name) why in't<br>
</div>
<div>Did you not justice? give to each his due?<br>
</div>
<div>For <i>Beaumont</i> (of those many) writ in few:<br>
</div>
<div>And <i>Massinger</i> in other few; the Main<br>
</div>
<div>Being sole Issues of sweet <i>Fletchers</i> brain.<br>
</div> (A. Cokayne, <span class="italic">A Chain of Golden Poems</span>, 1658, 217)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Plays16211625"></a>Plays, 1621&#150;1625</h2>About 1620 Massinger started to work with companies other than the King's Men, for whom he had so far co-scripted almost all his surviving plays. <span class="italic">The Virgin Martyr</span> was performed at the Red Bull, probably in 1620 and probably by His Majesty's Revels. And between about 1621 and 1625, while not breaking his connection with the King's Company, he wrote in all five unaided plays&#151;four tragicomedies and a comedy&#151;for the companies based at the Phoenix or Cockpit theatre. Another tragicomedy, <span class="italic">The Great Duke of Florence</span>, was licensed for performance by the queen's company at the Phoenix in July 1627. Since it is Massinger's only non-King's play after 1625&#151;unless, as seems unlikely, Donald S. Lawless is right that <span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span> was first performed in 1630 and not merely revived&#151;this has caused some puzzlement. It seems probable either that <span class="italic">The Great Duke</span> was written a year or two earlier and remained the property of the Phoenix company or that it was written in 1627 in fulfilment of an earlier obligation.<br>
<br>In the Phoenix tragicomedies&#151;<span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span> (1621/2?), <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> (1623), <span class="italic">The Renegado</span> (1624), <span class="italic">The Parliament of Love</span> (1624), and <span class="italic">The Great Duke of Florence</span> (1627)&#151;romantic plots are so shaped, as in many other Massinger plays, as to emphasize ethical themes and dilemmas. Seeming uprightness is often undermined or forced to rethink itself. For instance Leosthenes, in <span class="italic">The Bondman</span>, falls victim to the belief that military success gives him right of conquest over Cleora and, particularly where the disguised Pisander is concerned, that physical slavery is an index of moral slavery. More immediate political concerns are also explored. <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> fairly evidently, in its opening scenes, suggests support for the new anti-Spanish views embraced by Prince Charles and by the duke of Buckingham since their return from Spain in October 1623; the play was performed before the prince on 27 December 1623 at Whitehall. But it also, more subtly&#151;potentially less palatably&#151;sounds a warning note through the slaves' rebellion and through Pisander's lecture on the wider issue of a perceived &#145;descent from a benevolent patriarchy to governmental tyranny&#146;  (Patterson, 85). Similarly <span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span> (1621/2?) explores, without risking censorship or imaginative limitation, a situation at least analogous to the affairs of Frederick, elector palatine, and James I's policy of non-intervention on his behalf.<br>
<br>The comedy <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> (1625) scores more direct hits at the universally vilified monopolist Sir Giles Mompesson, from whom the rapacious Sir Giles Overreach is at least in part developed. Set in the country (although drawing on many of the conventions of &#145;city comedy&#146;) the play pits aristocratic virtue against <i>nouveau riche</i> greed, which it defeats by encouraging it to overreach itself. That <span class="italic">A New Way</span> became overwhelmingly Massinger's most popular play in later generations, however, is mainly the result of Sir Giles's energy of language and activity. Forever concocting new schemes, berating his underlings, walking &#145;to get me an appetite&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">II</span>.iii), triumphing over his enemies, and in defeat violent, insane, hallucinating, he is more like the protagonist of a revenge tragedy than the central figures in most contemporary comedy.<h2>
<a name="Patronage"></a>Patronage</h2>Massinger says in his 1624 dedication of <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> to Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery, that &#145;When it was first Acted, your Lordships liberall suffrage taught others to allow it for currant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 1.313). Many of the issues explored in Massinger's plays at this time&#151;attitudes to engagement in foreign wars, for instance&#151;were dear to the heart of Montgomery, Montgomery's brother the third earl of Pembroke, and their associates. It was at this point very probably, therefore, that the playwright succeeded in gaining Montgomery's patronage, perhaps in the form of the pension referred to by Aubrey. His first known attempt to attract the notice of the &#145;Honourable House&#146; in whose service his father &#145;Many years &hellip; happily spent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 1.313) was &#145;The Copy of a Letter&#146; (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1620), addressed to Pembroke. Later evidence of patronage by Montgomery (from 1630 also fourth earl of Pembroke) is the poem &#145;Sero, sed serio&#146; (1636), addressed to him as &#145;my most singular good Lord and Patron&#146;. The poem, on the death of the earl's son Charles, starts apologetically from Massinger's failure to write in honour of his marriage in 1634:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">I cursd my absence then<br>
</div>
<div>That hindred itt, and bitt my Star-crost pen<br>
</div>
<div>Too busie in Stage-blanks, and trifeling Rime.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.419)</blockquote>Massinger also sought the patronage of Robert Dormer, Philip Herbert's son-in-law, to whom <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> was dedicated on its publication in 1633.<br>
<br>Lady Katherine Stanhope (later countess of Chesterfield), Massinger's first known patron, was the sister of Fletcher's patron the earl of Huntingdon and was of fairly similar political persuasion to the Herberts. <span class="italic">The Duke of Milan</span> was dedicated to her in 1623; she is acknowledged as Massinger's &#145;Lady and Mistress&#146; in his poem &#145;A Newyeares Guift&#146; (<i>c</i>.1622). In 1630 he dedicated <span class="italic">The Renegado</span> to George Harding, Lord Berkeley, Stanhope's relative by marriage, and in 1632 he dedicated <span class="italic">The Emperor of the East</span> to Lord John Mohun, her son-in-law, noting that:<blockquote>My worthy friend M<sup>r</sup> <i>Aston Cokaine</i> your Nephew [also Stanhope's nephew], to my extraordinarie content, deliver'd to mee, that your Lordship at your vacant hours sometimes vouchsaf'd to peruse such trifles of mine, as have passed the Presse, and not alone warranted them in your gentle suffrage, but disdain'd not to bestow a remembrance of your love, and intended favour to mee. (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.403)</blockquote>As well as these aristocratic patrons Massinger attracted the attention and the money of, among others, Sir Francis Foljambe, recipient of an autograph poem to accompany a copy of <span class="italic">The Duke of Milan</span> in 1623 and co-dedicatee of <span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span> in 1632; the Norfolk landowner Sir Philip Knyvett, co-dedicatee of <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span> in 1629, to whose daughter Massinger addressed &#145;The Virgin's Character&#146; (<i>c</i>.1625&#150;1630); Sir Thomas Jay, a close associate of Massinger, also from Wiltshire, co-dedicatee of <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span>; Sir Robert Wiseman&#151;&#145;for many yeares&#146;, the playwright tells him in the 1636 dedication to <span class="italic">The Great Duke of Florence</span>, &#145;I had but faintly subsisted, if I had not often tasted of your Bounty&#146;; and Sir Warham St Leger and his son Sir Anthony, the former commemorated in &#145;A Funerall Poem Sacred to the Memorie of the Trewly Noble &hellip; Sir Warham Sentliger&#146; (1631?), the latter dedicatee of <span class="italic">The Unnatural Combat</span> in 1639.<h2>
<a name="TheKingsMen"></a>The King's Men</h2>By 1625 Massinger was well established as a playwright. Payment for plays and pensions or gifts from well-connected patrons mean that he may also have become fairly prosperous. (No doubt he was not rich, but the later perception of his knowing extreme poverty results mainly from the early &#145;tripartite letter&#146; and over-literal reading of references such as that, in the 1639 dedication of <span class="italic">The Unnatural Combat</span>, to his &#145;necessitous fortunes&#146;.) He became all the more well known when he succeeded Fletcher as company dramatist of the King's Men in 1625 or soon afterwards. (Fletcher had died in the major plague outbreak of that year, which was the subject of Massinger's poem &#145;London's Lamentable Estate, in any Great Visitation&#146;.) Although no contract survives it is clear that there must have been one; all Massinger's remaining plays were for this company with the exception of <span class="italic">The Great Duke of Florence</span>.<br>
<br>Contact with the king's company appears to have been maintained during Massinger's Phoenix years since he wrote for it the tragedies <span class="italic">The Duke of Milan</span> (<i>c</i>.1621) and <span class="italic">The Unnatural Combat</span> (<i>c</i>.1624). These explore, respectively, obsessional jealousy and a father's incestuous passion for his daughter; here seemingly brave and admirable public figures&#151;exposed or redeemed in the tragicomedies and comedies&#151;are destroyed by private flaws. <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span>, as performed in 1626 and published in 1629, is somewhat more complex in effect. This inaugural fanfare for and by the company's new staple dramatist draws on many classical sources in a way that is likely to excite comparison with Ben Jonson's Roman tragedy <span class="italic">Sejanus</span>, itself another of Massinger's sources. And with its three inset plays and impassioned defence by Paris of the moral, reformative function of the stage, <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span> encourages debate on the very premises of drama. The &#145;most perfit birth of my <i>Minerva</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.15) is presented confidently in print, complete with six commendatory poems: one in Latin; several, including one by the esteemed classicist and playwright Thomas May, stressing the appropriate Roman dignity of the work; and one by Joseph Taylor, the leading King's Men &#145;sharer&#146;, who first played Paris, professing &#145;our loves Antiquitie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.20).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span> was followed by several lost plays, which include <span class="italic">The Judge</span> (1627), <span class="italic">The Honour of Women</span> (1628), and <span class="italic">Minerva's Sacrifice</span> (1629). (Eight plays written by Massinger after 1625 are known to be lost and a number of other titles have been more conjecturally attached to his name.) <span class="italic">The Picture</span> (1629), a tragicomedy, subtly and often humorously examines jealousy, vanity, and double sexual standards before arriving at the deceptively simple conclusion:<blockquote>
<div>And to all married men be this a caution<br>
</div>
<div>Which they should duly tender as their life:<br>
</div>
<div>Neither to dote to[o] much nor doubt a wife.<br>
</div> (V.iii)</blockquote>In the process audiences were provided with some scenes that help to explain the dramatist's presence in the library of love studied by &#145;our courtly dames&#146; in John Johnson's <span class="italic">Academy of Love</span> (1641). For instance Queen Honoria enters masked, with <i>&#145;Musicke above, a song of pleasure&#146;</i>, to offer or seemingly offer Mathias:<blockquote>
<div>This moist palme, this soft lippe, and those delights<br>
</div>
<div>Which Darkenesse should onely judge of.<br>
</div> (P. Massinger, <span class="italic">The Picture</span>, 1629, <span class="smallcap">III</span>.v)</blockquote>According to the author, <span class="italic">The Picture</span> &#145;in the presentment found &hellip; a generall approbation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.195).<br>
<br>Massinger's last surviving tragedy, <span class="italic">Believe as you List</span> (1631), returns to the ancient world but only as a result of censorship. On 11 January 1631 Sir Henry Herbert, master of the revels:<blockquote>did refuse to allow of a play of Messinger's, because itt did contain dangerous matter, as the deposing of Sebastian king of Portugal, by Philip the [Second], and ther being a peace sworen twixte the kings of England and Spayne. (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.293)</blockquote>Probably there was also too evident a parallel between the hero's plight and that of Frederick of Bohemia, but changing the story of Sebastian (or the pretender claiming to be him) to the conveniently similar story of King Antiochus was apparently sufficient for Herbert to grant the revised play its licence on 6 May. Hearers may have rejoiced in the disingenuousness of the prologue to <span class="italic">Believe as you List</span>, which blames the apparent similarity of ancient things to &#145;a late, and sad example&#146; on the author's ignorance of &#145;<i>Cosmographie</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.305). As with <span class="italic">Barnavelt</span> and, in 1638, <span class="italic">The King and the Subject</span>, the non-publication of the play (until 1849) may suggest that it was too dangerous or too immediately topical to print, but this did not preclude its stage success.<br>
<br>It seems likely, although performances are not recorded, that <span class="italic">The City Madam</span> (1632) was successful in the theatre. This city comedy features a tester tested: Luke Frugal secretly observed by his brother Sir John as he uses the intended reformation of the wilful Frugal wife and daughters as an excuse for unreasonable harshness, revenge, and personal financial gain. Luke provides a central role popular with actors, especially in the nineteenth century. (Nineteenth-century adaptations of the play, however, give a somewhat exaggerated impression of Luke's importance; <span class="italic">The City Madam</span> is less a one-man play than <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>.) Luke's rapt soliloquy &#145;'Twas no phantastick object, but a truth&#146;  (<span class="smallcap">III</span>.iii), on the gold, silver, and jewels he thinks his own, is one of the more psychologically convincing speeches in Massinger.<h2>
<a name="Theuntundkennellquarrel"></a>The untun'd kennell quarrel</h2>Massinger's commenders' confident proclamation of the excellence of <span class="italic">The Roman Actor</span> in 1629 may have been directed at sections of the literary community who were more doubtful about his worth. This at least is suggested by the fact that in the same year the playwright became embroiled in a quarrel over the place and function of professional playwrights and their work. The dispute began, or perhaps only simmered over, when William Davenant's <span class="italic">The Just Italian</span> was badly received at the Blackfriars theatre in October. Davenant's supporters, led by the poet Thomas Carew, attacked James Shirley's contrastingly well received <span class="italic">The Grateful Servant</span>, given at the Phoenix in November, as work for a stage:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">where not a tong<br>
</div>
<div>Of th' untun'd Kennell, can a line repeat<br>
</div>
<div>Of serious sence.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Poems of Thomas Carew</span>, ed. R. Dunlap, 1949, 96)</blockquote>Shirley's supporters replied in kind in the verses attached to the 1630 quarto of his play. They included Massinger, who used terms similar to those in which his own commenders often praised his own work to contrast Shirley's &#145;well/Exprest and orderd&#146; composition with Davenant's &#145;forc'd expressions&#146;, &#145;rack'd phraze&#146;, and<blockquote>
<div>Babell compositions to amaze<br>
</div>
<div>The tortur'd reader.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.416)</blockquote>The documents of the second, more vitriolic phase of the struggle remained unpublished until 1980; Massinger contributed a prologue for a 1630 revival of his Phoenix play <span class="italic">The Maid of Honour</span>, which attacked those resolved to dislike any play performed at that theatre and also censured Carew's Italianate &#145;Chamber Madrigalls or loose raptures&#146;  (Garrett, 60); a reply, almost certainly by Davenant, defends Carew, his &#145;ditties fit onely for the eares of Kings&#146; and all &#145;Ingenious Gentlemen&#146; and attacks Massinger and the actors&#151;as a professional playwright he is merely their &#145;hirelinge&#146;  (Garrett, 62&#150;3). Finally, in a furious counter-defence, &#145;A charme for a libeller&#146;, Massinger attacks the libeller for hiding behind the so-called &#145;poets tribune&#146; Carew as well as for slander and immorality, upholds writing plays for money on classical precedent, and maintains that &#145;witlesse malice&#146; cannot overthrow:<blockquote>
<div>The buildinge of that Meritt whiche I owe<br>
</div>
<div>To knoweinge mens opinions.<br>
</div> (Garrett, 65)</blockquote>It is clear that this is less an argument between rival companies than one between professional dramatists and newer courtly rivals. (Massinger remains staple dramatist at the Globe and Blackfriars while rallying to the defence of Phoenix actors and playwright.) How long the quarrel went on, whether it ended in any sort of reconciliation, and how consistently seriously the participants took it&#151;it was no doubt good for trade at both the Blackfriars and the Phoenix&#151;are unknown. But it may explain a number of references to discontent with Massinger's plays&#151;by, for example, the &#145;gallants&#146; of Henry Parker's manuscript poem &#145;To his honoured frend Mr Phillip Massinger, having not had that just applause for one of his playes which was due to him&#146;  (T. A. Dunn, <span class="italic">Philip Massinger: the Man and the Playwright</span>, 1957, 33) or by:<blockquote>
<div>[the] <i>tribe</i>, who in their <i>Wisedomes</i> dare accuse,<br>
</div>
<div>this ofspring of thy <i>Muse</i>.<br>
</div>(Shirley's poem printed with <span class="italic">The Renegado</span>; <span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 2.14)</blockquote>In 1631 or 1632 the dramatist himself says that <span class="italic">The Emperor of the East</span> has:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">suffer'd by the rage,<br>
</div>
<div>And envie of some Catos of the stage.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.408)</blockquote>It is clear from several remarks in its front matter, and probably from its early publication in 1632, that <span class="italic">The Emperor</span>, a tragicomedy with sources in Byzantine history, was one of Massinger's least popular plays.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Either the &#145;untun'd kennell&#146; affair rumbled on for some time or there were similar &#145;wars of the theatres&#146; soon afterwards. The prologue of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> (1633) speaks of two plays failing, of two years' silence (mystifying commentators since this was clearly not the case), and of the need to confute rumours that the author has &#145;quite forgot to make a Play&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.114). <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, performed at the Blackfriars in 1633 and &#145;well likte&#146; at court in January 1634, seems an appropriate play with which to &#145;regain his credit lost&#146;. For while there are elements of serious testing and moral interrogation here, and a shadowing of some contemporary issues in the Robin Hood-like code observed by Severino and his bandit followers, on the whole the play is less morally absolute and more light-hearted and festive than most of Massinger's earlier work. (Its title-page in <span class="italic">Three New Playes</span>, 1655, bills it as &#145;A Comical-History&#146;.) That this is the case is due, above all, to the presence of the energetic, generous, red-blooded, sometimes outrageous Durazzo, the eponymous guardian whose love of hunting, good living, and no-nonsense lust is set against the more swooning amours of his nephew and ward Caldoro and his beloved Caliste.<br>
<br>However much sniping may have continued from supporters of Davenant or some other rival, Massinger's career in the 1630s continued to thrive, perhaps buoyed up, indeed, by the publicity attendant on the &#145;untun'd kennell&#146; affair and the brush with censorship over <span class="italic">Believe as you List</span>. It can be argued that the publication of six of Massinger's plays between 1630 and 1633 suggests decreasing popularity since companies often (if by no means invariably) protected work from publication while it was likely to be reusable. But confidence in achievements so far is suggested by Massinger's action, about 1632&#150;3, in having copies of his then published seven unaided plays, together with <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>, bound into what is now called the Harbord volume (Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington). The volume contains corrections in Massinger's hand up to about half way through. Perhaps he intended to present the collection to a patron but he may also have been at least thinking ahead to putting together his works, following the example of the Jonson and Shakespeare collections of 1616 and 1623. And if non-publication is indeed a sign of continuing theatrical viability it may be significant that only two of Massinger's hitherto unpublished plays were printed between 1633 and his death in 1640: <span class="italic">The Great Duke of Florence</span> in 1636 and <span class="italic">The Unnatural Combat</span> in 1639.<br>
<br>Massinger's last decade was one of undiminished business&#151;of making good &#145;in some labor'd Song&#146; that &#145;Though he grow old, <i>Apollo</i> still is yong&#146;  (epilogue to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.197). He produced at least a play a year, besides working on poems for patrons and friends (usually left in manuscript; a number of similar works may have perished) and revision of Fletcher or Fletcher/Massinger plays, including <span class="italic">A Very Woman</span> (1634) and <span class="italic">Cleander</span> (a version of Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Lovers' Progress</span>), which was presented before Queen Henrietta Maria at Blackfriars in May 1634. There were also court productions, untouched or more lightly revised, of the Massinger/Fletcher collaborations&#151;<span class="italic">The Spanish Curate</span> in 1638 and 1639, and <span class="italic">The Custom of the Country</span> in 1630 and 1638&#151;and <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>, which was given at the Cockpit-in-Court, Whitehall, on 3 February 1631. A second edition of <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> was brought out in 1638.<br>
<br>In 1636 <span class="italic">The Bashful Lover</span>, Massinger's last surviving play, exploited the fashion for romance and Neoplatonism particularly associated with Henrietta Maria. Galeazzo, the suitor of the title, exemplifies noble, selfless, sometimes self-abnegating love and ultimately wins Matilda through it. But that this was by no means the only sort of drama Massinger was writing in the late 1630s is shown by the one speech that survives from the tragedy <span class="italic">The King and the Subject</span> and begins:<blockquote>
<div>Monys? Wee'le rayse supplies what ways we please,<br>
</div>
<div>And force you to subscribe to blanks.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Sir Henry Herbert recorded it because some time before June 1638 Charles I himself, &#145;readinge over the play at Newmarket, set his marke upon the place with his owne hande, and in thes words: &#147;This is too insolent, and to bee changed&#148;&#146;. &#145;Note&#146;, Herbert continues, that &#145;the poett makes it the speech of a king, Don Pedro, king of Spayne, and spoken to his subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 1.xxxix); he might have added that Charles probably understood, and the playwright and company perhaps intended, an allusion to his raising of forced loans. Following a change of title (possibly to <span class="italic">The Tyrant</span>, which appears in Humphrey Moseley's 1660 list of Massinger plays) and &#145;reformations&#146; which were to be &#145;most strictly observed&#146; in performance, <span class="italic">The King and the Subject</span> was licensed on 5 June, a day after Herbert was &#145;given &hellip; power from the king to allowe of the play&#146;.<br>
<br>When dedicating <span class="italic">The Unnatural Combat</span> to Anthony St Leger in 1639 Massinger looked back with pride and a degree of nostalgia on &#145;this old Tragedie, without Prologue, or Epilogue, it being composed in a time (and that too, peradventure, as knowing as this) when such by ornaments, were not advanced above the fabricque of the whole worke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 2.197). But his plays do not generally seem to have been perceived as old-fashioned. The last of them, the lost <span class="italic">The Fair Anchoress of Pausilippo</span> (1640) may, to judge from the title, have been in the fashionable vein of <span class="italic">The Bashful Lover</span>. And where older plays were concerned, in August 1639 the lord chamberlain protected the five Phoenix plays of the 1620s for the King and Queen's Young Company, and in August 1641 he protected from publication, for the King's Men, seven plays wholly by Massinger (<span class="italic">The City Madam</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">The Bashful Lover</span>, and four late lost works), and eleven of the collaborations.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Massinger died in March 1640 in a house on Bankside, &#145;neer the then playhouse&#146;; &#145;he went to bed well, and dyed suddenly&#151;but not of the plague&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 1.xliv, xliii). He was buried on 18 March in Southwark Cathedral, either, as Aston Cokayne says, in the church and in the same grave as John Fletcher or, according to the probably less reliable testimony of Aubrey and Wood, in the Bull-Head churchyard. Since he was a &#145;stranger&#146;&#151;resident outside the parish&#151;the burial fee was doubled to &pound;2.<br>
<br>Almost nothing is known of Massinger's personal life and character as opposed to his literary associations. His friends or acquaintances included John Selden, the jurist; among his fellow dramatists were John Ford and James Shirley. In a younger generation, Philip Edwards and Colin Gibson point out, a group of men who were at Oxford in the early 1620s seem to have shared &#145;an enthusiasm for the theatre and an admiration for the dramatist who was twenty years their senior&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 1.xxxviii); one of these was the minor poet James Smith, whom Massinger hailed (in a largely humorous context) as his &#145;son&#146; (&#145;To his sonne, upon his <i>Minerva</i>&#146;, <i>c</i>.1635?; <span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 4.423). He also had contacts at the Inner Temple, to his &#145;Honored, and selected friends&#146; at which he dedicated <span class="italic">The Picture</span> in 1630, mentioning no names mainly because &#145;I had rather injoy (as I have donne) the reall proofes of their friendship, than mountebancke like boast their numbers in a Catalogue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 3.195). Particularly in the nineteenth century Massinger was supposed, on flimsy evidence, to be of a gentle, grave, melancholy nature. The subsequently discovered irate &#145;Charm for a libeller&#146;, where he does not rule out the possibility of confuting his critic with a cudgel, is one useful corrective to this image.<br>
<br>The only known likeness of Massinger is the engraving by Thomas Cross in <span class="italic">Three New Playes</span> (1655); all other representations of him derive from it but adapt it to accord with different generations' perceptions of the author. Eighteenth-century editions use Grignion's engraving based fairly closely on Cross; Massinger is more vigorous and earnest in the 1820 engraving by John Thurston, and more melancholy and uncertain in the R. Bocourt version used as the frontispiece of Arthur Symons's selection of 1887.<br>
<br>Massinger's reputation has undergone a series of fluctuations; it reached its zenith in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century and its nadir in the early to mid-twentieth century. Commenders of his work in his own lifetime emphasize its constructive skill and strength, and the purity, dignity, and theatrical appropriateness of its language; for example Sir Thomas Jay praises <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> for:<blockquote>
<div>The craftie <i>Mazes</i> of the cunning plot;<br>
</div>
<div>The polish'd phrase, the sweet expressions; got<br>
</div>
<div>Neither by theft, nor violence; the conceipt<br>
</div>
<div>Fresh, and unsullied.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 2.296)</blockquote>Those who disagreed, then as often later, perceived crude moralizing and dull dialogue&#151;Davenant's &#145;rude/Modells of vice and virtue unpursued&#146;  (Garrett, 62) or what Abraham Wright, about 1640, saw as &#145;onely plaine downright relating the matter; without any new dress either of language or fancy&#146; in <span class="italic">A New Way</span>  (<span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span>, 2.379).<br>
<br>During the 1640s and 1650s Massinger was quite well represented in such miscellanies as Cotgrave's <span class="italic">English Treasury</span> (1655). Then and for the rest of the century he features in lists of notable poets much more frequently than such subsequently more popular contemporaries as Webster, Marston, Ford, or Middleton. While the theatres were closed <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">A Very Woman</span>, and <span class="italic">The Bashful Lover</span> first became available to readers in 1655, and <span class="italic">The City Madam</span> in 1658. With other pre-interregnum successes a number of Massinger's plays remained popular on the early Restoration stage. <span class="italic">The Bondman</span> seems to have appealed most; between 1661 and 1666 Samuel Pepys saw and read the play several times with enthusiasm, and praised especially Thomas Betterton's Pisander and the Cleora of Mrs Saunderson (later Mrs Betterton). On the whole, however, Massinger's fame declined markedly during the remainder of the century. Unmentioned in the Beaumont and Fletcher folios he did not share those authors' high renown. Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span> (1703), founded on <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>, was popular throughout the eighteenth century; Rowe's failure to acknowledge his original suggests to what extent Massinger's star had waned.<br>
<br>From the mid-eighteenth century, however, this trend began to be reversed. Massinger fared well in such selections as <span class="italic">The British Muse</span> (1738) and Dodsley's <span class="italic">Select Collection</span> (1744), and full editions followed in 1759 (reissued in 1761) and 1779. The plays were studied for their historical interest and admired for their &#145;flowing, various, elegant, and manly&#146; diction, clear morality, strength of characterization, and, concomitantly, their theatrical viability  (Garrett, 93). From about 1780 performance of some of the plays, above all <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> (somewhat adapted) became more frequent. After John Henderson first played Sir Giles in 1781 the part was soon established as one which all leading male actors would wish to attempt. It was one of Edmund Kean's most successful roles from 1816; audiences, among them Byron, Mary Shelley, and William Hazlitt, were deeply affected by Sir Giles's outrageous boldness and sudden and total overthrow, and by Kean's suitably spasmodic and passionate style. The play remained immensely popular in Britain until at least the 1860s and in America until the 1880s, with some productions in the early twentieth century. <span class="italic">The City Madam</span> enjoyed not inconsiderable but briefer success in such adaptations as Sir James Bland Burges's <span class="italic">Riches, or, The Wife and Brother</span>, first performed in 1810.<br>
<br>Massinger was at his most well known, partly because of such productions, in the early nineteenth century. He was established, in repeated references to his &#145;sentimental biography&#146;, as a noble, &#145;melancholy&#146; figure. William Gifford's editions of 1805 and 1813 were the most thorough that had so far been accorded a contemporary of Shakespeare. In some quarters, however, critical disenchantment soon began to make itself felt; in particular, clarity of language and morality began to seem to some, as in the playwright's own time, insipid. Hazlitt found him harsh, crabbed, unpoetic; Charles Lamb, in his influential <span class="italic">Specimens of English Dramatic Poets</span> (1808), judged him inferior in &#145;the higher requisites of his art&#146; to &#145;Ford, Webster, Tourneur, Heywood, and others&#146;&#151;&#145;He never shakes or disturbs the mind with grief. He is read with composure and placid delight&#146;  (Garrett, 116). While Massinger still had his partisans, notably Coleridge, such perspectives became, increasingly&#151;with the addition, later in the century, of complaints about his &#145;indecency&#146;&#151;the critical orthodoxy. Lamb's and Hazlitt's views are essentially repeated in the mostly unfavourable Victorian verdicts of Leslie Stephen and Edmund Gosse and, most famously, in T. S. Eliot's essay of 1920, where the dramatist is easy, bland, an initiator of the &#145;dissociation of sensibility&#146;  (T. S. Eliot, &#145;Philip Massinger&#146;, <span class="italic">The Sacred Wood</span>, 1920, 123&#150;43).<br>
<br>Eliot long seemed to have delivered the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to Massinger's reputation. By the 1970s, however, some interest in him was reviving in scholarly circles, much helped by a major edition in 1976. Study has concentrated especially on social and political aspects of the plays. <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span> continued periodically to be revived in the theatre.<br>
