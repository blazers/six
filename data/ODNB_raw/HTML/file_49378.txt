<span class="headword">Balliol,  Dervorguilla  de</span>, lady of Galloway  (<em>d.</em> 1290), <span class="occ">noblewoman and benefactor</span>, was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49362/', "Alan, lord of Galloway (b. before 1199, d. 1234)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49365/', "David, earl of Huntingdon (d. 1219)")</script>. Born some time after 1209, the date of her parents' marriage, her distinctive Gaelic name, Derbhforgaill, was probably derived from an Irish ancestor in the Galloway line, possibly from an aunt, and was in turn transmitted to a granddaughter through one of her own daughters. Although Dervorguilla was the lord of Galloway's third daughter, and the second of his marriage to Margaret, the fact that Margaret was herself an eldest daughter was adjudged to give Dervorguilla's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John")</script>, the stronger right to the vacant throne of Scotland over the claims of Robert (V) de Brus, son of Margaret's younger sister, Isabel. This was the outcome of the Great Cause of 1291&#150;2, the culmination of a series of events in which Dervorguilla's connections transformed the fortunes of the Balliol family.<br>
<br>In 1233, at least five years after the death of her mother, and two years after the death of her uncle&#151;the last of her father's legitimate male heirs&#151;Dervorguilla married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1208/', "John de Balliol (b. before 1208, d. 1268)")</script>, lord of Barnard Castle in co. Durham. In the following year, on or about 2 February 1234, her father died, and Dervorguilla and her new husband inherited a third share of the Galloway lordship; they later took charge of her natural brother, Thomas of Galloway, imprisoning him in Barnard Castle. Following the death in 1237 of her maternal uncle John (le Scot), earl of Huntingdon and Chester, Dervorguilla and her elder sister, Christina (or Christiana), succeeded to their mother's right in the honour of Huntingdon and in Earl John's Scottish lands, mainly in eastern and north-eastern Scotland, and to various properties in eastern England granted in exchange for their claims upon the earldom of Chester which Earl John had inherited in 1232 through his mother, Maud, wife of David, earl of Huntingdon, and sister of Ranulf (III), earl of Chester; after 1237 the honour of Chester was retained in English royal hands. The deaths of Christina (in 1246) and Earl John's widow meant that Dervorguilla's share was substantially enlarged. Christina's death also meant that her share of her father's inheritance was divided between Dervorguilla and her eldest (half-)sister, Helen, wife of Roger de Quincy, earl of Winchester and constable of Scotland, Dervorguilla's evidently being the larger and more valuable share.<br>
<br>Between 1234 and 1246 Dervorguilla clearly brought a considerable accession of wealth to the Balliol family. Precise figures are lacking, but her Scottish lands alone probably came to be worth slightly less than &pound;470 per annum. In her widowhood, after 1268, she retained much of her vast inheritance and dower in her own hands and was a considerable patron. An early fifteenth-century chronicler, Andrew Wyntoun, composed a lengthy panegyric entitled &#145;How Devorguil that Lady Spendyt hyr Tresoure Devotly&#146;, crediting her with the foundation of friaries in Dumfries and Wigtown. As in the case of the fifteenth-century bridge across the Nith at Dumfries that bears her name, her reputation for pious munificence has probably gone beyond authenticated record. None the less, she was the first and last member of the Balliol family to have both the incentive and the means to become the founder of a major monastery. In 1273 she endowed the Cistercian abbey of Dulce Cor or Sweetheart in eastern Galloway in fond memory of her husband, whose corpse was reburied there, and whose embalmed heart she kept in an ivory casket. On his behalf, she also brought together the endowments and formulated the statutes of Balliol College, Oxford, a house of scholars founded as an indirect result of transgressions committed by her husband against the bishop of Durham in 1255 (her name is commemorated there by the Dervorguilla Society).<br>
<br>Dervorguilla de Balliol died on 28 January 1290 and was buried in Sweetheart Abbey. She is known to have had at least eight children with John de Balliol, and she outlived all except the youngest of her four sons, Hugh, Alan, Alexander, and John, later King John. The names and sequence of her four daughters are uncertain but they were probably Margaret, Cecily, Ada, and Eleanor, in that order.<br>
