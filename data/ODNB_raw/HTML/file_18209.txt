<span class="headword">Martin,  Samuel</span>  (1817&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born on 28 April 1817 at Woolwich, the son of William Martin, shipwright, and his wife, Mary Pool (<i>d</i>. 1829). His mother died when he was twelve years old and that left a lasting impression upon him. He received his early education from Thomas James, the minister of Salem Chapel, Woolwich, and later at the school conducted by the Revd Richard Cecil at Turvey, Bedfordshire. In 1829 he joined a firm of architects in the City of London but abandoned his training there and entered the Western College, Exeter, in October 1836. His ambition to serve the London Missionary Society in India was thwarted when the society decided in 1839 that he was not strong enough physically for the work. In 1839 he was ordained at Highbury Chapel, Cheltenham, and on 2 October of the same year he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1880), the daughter of John Trice of Tunbridge Wells. They had at least three sons. In July 1842 he moved to Westminster Chapel, London, the new church built by the Metropolitan Chapel Building Association the previous year. His ministry there was extremely successful and in 1863 the chapel had to be pulled down and a new one, capable of seating up to 3000 people, was opened in 1865. In 1862 he was chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. His last years were dogged by ill health and in 1876 Henry Oliver joined him as co-pastor. He delivered his last sermon in June 1877 and died on 5 July 1878 at 19 Belgrave Road, Pimlico, London. He was buried at Abney Park cemetery, London, on 10 July after services conducted by his fellow congregationalist J. C. Harrison and by A. P. Stanley, the dean of Westminster.<br>
<br>Samuel Martin made Westminster Chapel one of the foremost nonconformist preaching stations in London, although his preaching style was quiet and simple with no dramatic rhetorical flourishes. He had modified the strict Calvinism of his father and propounded an evangelicalism that was both practical and devotional and which centred on God's universal beneficent rule. His numerous publications exemplify the way in which the horizons of evangelicalism were broadening during the Victorian era. Many of these were lectures delivered at meetings of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and reveal his concern for young people. These covered a large number of topics, such as history in <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Christianity</span> (1862), morals in <span class="italic">Gambling</span> (1856), politics in <span class="italic">Christianity, Pure Socialism</span> (1851), science in <span class="italic">Michael Faraday</span> (1867), and economics in his twelve lectures, <span class="italic">Money</span> (1850). He was one of the first vice-presidents of the YMCA, and his lectures attracted a wide audience among the shop assistants of West End stores. Above all he was a gifted and attractive pastor, sensitive to people's needs and predicaments, and radiating a warm sympathy with all who sought his ministrations.<br>
