<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Henry</span>  (1809&#150;1899), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, son of George Vaughan and his wife, Elizabeth Andrews, was born into a Quaker family on 17 April 1809 in Southwark, London, where his father carried on a successful business as a hat manufacturer. He was privately educated at Walthamstow, and on the death of his father in 1828 succeeded to a large fortune. He spent much time travelling and became a cultivated, enthusiastic, and eclectic collector of works of art, especially of prints and drawings by J. W. M. Turner, with whom he was personally acquainted. He was a member of the Athenaeum, was elected FSA in 1879, and was one of the founders and most active members of the Burlington Fine Arts Club. Though undoubtedly one of the outstanding English collectors of his time, and a generous lender to exhibitions and museums, he appears to have been something of a recluse, whose reputation is largely based on his important gifts and bequests to British museums. He died, unmarried, on 26 November 1899, at 28 Cumberland Terrace, Regent's Park, London, where he had lived since 1834.<br>
<br>In 1886 Vaughan had presented (anonymously) John Constable's celebrated <span class="italic">Hay Wain</span> to the National Gallery, having purchased it at Christies twenty years earlier. In 1887 he gave five important Michelangelo drawings, all bought at the Woodburn sale in 1860, to the British Museum. By his will Vaughan distributed his wealth among various medical charities and hospitals, and the bulk of his art collections among museums. Thus the British Museum department of prints and drawings received a further 555 items, including fifty-seven old master drawings, over 300 drawings by John Flaxman, Thomas Lawrence, and Thomas Stothard, and, above all, nearly a hundred proofs of Turner's <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span> and twenty-three drawings connected with it. Some of the drawings were transferred from Vaughan's bequest to the National Gallery, which also received various sculptures and Italian and British paintings (the latter now in the Tate collection). To the Victoria and Albert Museum he assigned his collections of stained glass and carved panels, six Turner watercolours, and the full-scale studies for Constable's <span class="italic">Hay Wain</span> and <span class="italic">Leaping Horse</span>, which had been on loan to that museum since 1862. To University College, London, he bequeathed the remainder of his <span class="italic">Liber</span> prints, his collection of Constable mezzotints, his Rembrandt etchings and other prints, and a number of English drawings. The rest of Vaughan's outstanding and scholarly collection of Turner watercolours&#151;he was described by Ruskin as &#145;a great Turner man&#146;  (Dawson, 39)&#151;was divided between Edinburgh and Dublin. The National Gallery of Scotland received a representative selection of thirty-nine drawings, and a similar group of thirty-one drawings went to the National Gallery of Ireland.<br>
