<span class="headword">Stanley,  James</span>, seventh earl of Derby  (1607&#150;1651), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, the so-called &#145;martyr earl&#146; executed for his loyalty to Charles I during and after the English civil war, was born at Knowsley in Lancashire on 31 January 1607, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72296/', "William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby (bap. 1561, d. 1642)")</script>, and Elizabeth de Vere (1575&#150;1627), daughter of Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford. On 26 June 1626 he married, at The Hague, Charlotte de La Tr&eacute;moille (1599&#150;1664) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26260/', "Stanley, Charlotte, countess of Derby")</script>], daughter of Claude de La Tr&eacute;moille, duc de Thouars, and Charlotte Brabantine de Nassau, daughter of William the Silent. They had six children who survived beyond infancy, Charles, Edward, William, Henrietta Maria, Katherine, and Amelia. Until the death of his father on 29 September 1642 James Stanley was known as Lord Strange, despite the fact that Earl William had not inherited the barony of Strange.<br>
<br>Lord Strange was given great responsibilities at an early age. After being educated by private tutors in the great Stanley households at Knowsley and Lathom, and on his return in 1625 from journeys to France and Italy, he was elected MP for Liverpool&#151;a seat of which the Stanleys were chief patron&#151;and on 1 February 1626 he was admitted to the Order of the Bath at the coronation of Charles I. More importantly on 27 September 1626 Attorney-General Heath was ordered by the duke of Buckingham to draw up joint grants to Lord Strange and his father of the offices of lord lieutenant of Lancashire and Cheshire and chamberlain of the county palatine of Chester. It soon became apparent that his father's participation in these major offices, as in the running of the Stanley estates, was purely nominal. Lord Strange was left to run single-handedly the lieutenancy and to restore the Stanleys' economic fortunes that had been seriously damaged by a ruinous inheritance dispute between his father and his nieces that had begun in 1594 when William succeeded his brother as sixth earl of Derby. The settlement of the dispute in 1610 was only achieved at huge expenses in lawyers' fees and out-of-court settlements with the earl's nieces, which were funded by heavy borrowing and sales of land. In meeting this problem Lord Strange was helped by a handsome dowry of &pound;24,000 on his marriage, part of which he used to recover some of the lost family estates. He also undertook a vigorous estate administration policy in both England and the Isle of Man.<br>
<br>Lord Strange's <span class="italic">Private Devotions</span> and his surviving commonplace books and prayers indicate that he adhered firmly to the theology and liturgy of the English church as it had developed during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. These views were confirmed by his marriage to a woman who was so closely connected with the anti-Catholic cause in Europe that the elector palatine and his wife were present at the wedding in 1626. His distaste for the ecclesiastical policies of Charles I and Archbishop Laud accounts for his withdrawal from the court for much of the 1630s. His antipathy to Laudian bishops also explains his decision to vote for a bill aimed at excluding bishops from the House of Lords early in 1641 during the first session of the Long Parliament, at which he was a frequent attender.<br>
<br>Yet his misgivings about royal ecclesiastical policies did not prevent Lord Strange from being a loyal supporter of Charles I in the months before the outbreak of the civil war in 1641&#150;2. In 1642 he seized stores of ammunition in the castles at Liverpool and Lancaster for the king. His attempt on 15 July 1642 to persuade the municipal authorities in Manchester to surrender their ammunition failed and provoked a riot, an incident which was used as the basis of parliament's impeachment of him for high treason, which was published on 16 September 1642. Ironically he was also mistrusted by Charles I and those around him. Clarendon blamed him for being &#145;unactive&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.471). One of the reasons for this may have been that in the late summer and autumn of 1642, because Lord Strange was appalled at the growing divisions in the north-west and the damage they caused to Stanley power there, he made unsuccessful attempts to get parliamentarians and royalists in the north-west to agree to truces. This might have been misinterpreted as lukewarmness to the king's cause. Relations between the court and Lord Strange were also damaged when the king decided to set up his standard declaring war on the parliamentarians on 22 August 1642 at Nottingham and not, as Lord Strange had recommended, at Warrington. His reputation at court was not improved by his poor showing as a soldier in the early months of the civil war, which is partly to be explained by his strained relations with his fellow royalist commanders, Richard, Lord Molyneaux, and Thomas Tyldesley, both Catholics.<br>
<br>Strange was forced to abandon his week-long siege of Manchester on 2 October 1642, four days after he became earl of Derby, and he failed to prevent parliamentarian garrisons occupying Preston and Lancaster. He made an unsuccessful attack on Bolton on 16 February 1643 and two days later failed to capture Lancaster Castle. Although in March 1643 he retook Preston and in April repelled Sir William Brereton's attack on Warrington, these successes were forgotten in the wake of a major defeat he suffered at the hands of a smaller parliamentarian force at Whalley on 20 April 1643, which was quickly followed by the surrender to the parliamentarians of Preston, Wigan, and Warrington. It has been suggested  (Hutton, <span class="italic">Royalist War Effort</span>, 82&#150;3, 121) that these defeats contributed to the decision of the royalist council of war to reduce its reliance on territorial magnates like Derby in favour of professional generals like John Lord Byron. Derby's visit to York after these defeats to plead with Queen Henrietta Maria for armed assistance proved fruitless and he was ordered to the Isle of Man, which it was believed was threatened by a Scottish invasion.<br>
<br>Derby arrived on the Isle of Man on 15 June 1643 to find it on the brink of a rebellion led by Edward Christian of Maughold, who had been deprived of the governorship of the island in 1634 but who had been restored to favour as receiver-general in 1636. Among the rebels' grievances were payments of tithes to the church and the earl's policy of trying to replace the Manx &#145;tenure of straw&#146; by which many of his tenants held their lands, a customary tenure akin to freehold, with commercial leases. They also demanded that the 24 Keys (the island's governing body) be chosen by the people and that the deemsters (the island's judges) be chosen by this body and not by the earl of Derby. Derby forestalled this major attack on the Stanleys' prerogative powers in the island by adroitly combining a willingness to listen to the islanders' grievances (meetings to consider them were held at Castle Peel on 18 July and at Castle Rushen on 30 October) with minimal concessions and firmness (Christian was imprisoned and remained there until 1651).<br>
<br>In March 1644 Derby returned to England because Lathom, commanded by Countess Charlotte, was besieged by parliamentarian troops. He appealed successfully to Prince Rupert for assistance and their combined forces won a battle at Stockport on 25 May, relieved Lathom, and retook Liverpool. On 28 May they also recaptured Bolton, but only after the massacre of at least 1000 soldiers and civilians. In the words of a contemporary pamphlet, Rupert took Bolton, &#145;denying quarter to any, whether soldiers or men in their houses, till the sword drunk with blood was sheathed&#146;  (Pendlebury, 9). The earl was personally blamed for the murder of one parliamentarian, Captain Booth. Rupert's military success in the north was halted by his defeat at the battle of Marston Moor on 2 July 1644. The countess retired to the Isle of Man on 30 July and she was joined in September by her husband, leaving Lathom again under siege (it finally surrendered in December). After crushing a resurgence of revolt, led this time by Edward Christian's brother, William, Derby set about rebuilding and extending the island's defences from his home at Derby House within the walls of Castle Rushen. He remained there until 1651, the island providing a safe haven for royalist refugees.<br>
<br>Derby's refusal to surrender the island to the parliamentarians ensured that all his efforts to end the sequestration of his English estates failed. At the very end of 1644 negotiations brokered by two of the earl's officers, William Farington and John Greenhalgh, came to nothing. Countess Charlotte's journey to London in 1647 to plead his case was in vain. On 12 July 1649 Derby's petition to parliament submitted in January 1649 to allow him to compound for his estates was accepted on Fairfax's recommendation (the fine was fixed at over &pound;15,572), but this decision was later reversed. The earl was also excepted from the amnesties offered to royalists in the parliamentarian proposals made for a settlement at Uxbridge in 1644, in the Newcastle propositions in 1646, and at Newport in 1648.<br>
<br>In the period after the king's execution hatred of Derby among supporters of the new regime was increased by his scornful reply in July 1649 refusing Henry Ireton's demand that he surrender the Isle of Man, which was printed by parliamentarian order. A petition circulating in some south-eastern parishes of Lancashire at about this time indicted the earl as &#145;the first and principall Incendiary of war in the countie&#146; and (echoing army remonstrances against Charles I in 1648) concluded that &#145;our Countye being thus defiled with blood cannot otherwise be purged then by the blood of those who shed it&#146;  (Manchester Central Library, Manchester Archives and Local Studies, BR f 942.962 P 13). In May 1650 his daughters were imprisoned by parliamentarian order. Stanley estates began to be sold by the trustees of the Commonwealth under the first of three acts of sale passed in July 1650. In these circumstances Derby's return to England in August 1651 to join the king's army <i>en route</i> from Scotland was extremely risky. It was later alleged that his wife prodded him into action, telling him to &#145;pull off the breeches and she would put them on, and then lead them on&#146;  (Green, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, 1296).<br>
<br>Derby landed with a small force in Lancashire on 15 August and met the king on 17 August. His attempt to rally presbyterian support in Lancashire behind the king failed and on 25 August his forces were comprehensively defeated near Wigan by Colonel Robert Lilburne. He escaped, after being given shelter by the Penderels at Boscobel House in Shropshire, to join the king's army at Worcester a day before the royalist defeat there on 3 September. He helped the king escape capture, guiding him to his friends at Boscobel. From there he went north, but at Newport in Shropshire gave himself up to parliamentarian troops led by Captain Oliver Edge. After being imprisoned in Chester Castle, on 29 September, he was arraigned on a charge of high treason by a court martial. Despite the support of Oliver Cromwell his plea for clemency was rejected, as was his defence that he had been given quarter when he had surrendered to Captain Edge. He was condemned to death. During his last days he met his daughters and was reconciled with his eldest son, Charles, whom he had disinherited in a will he had drafted before he left the Isle of Man on the mistaken assumption that his son had accepted the English republic. On 15 October he was executed at Bolton, the scene of the massacre of 1644. His body was then taken to be buried in the Derby chapel in Ormskirk church.<br>
<br>Derby's violent death ended an undistinguished career. He had made only a limited contribution to the royalist war effort in north-west England and his heavy-handed rule of the Isle of Man had prompted mounting opposition among many islanders. At the end of his life even his earlier success in restoring his family's economic fortunes had been undone. Not only were the Stanley estates confiscated, but by virtue of a parliamentary act of July 1651 some of these were sold. It is difficult to envisage a more problematic legacy than the one he left his son.<br>
