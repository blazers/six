<span class="headword">Ransome,  Robert Charles</span>  (1830&#150;1886), <span class="occ">agricultural engineer</span>, was born on 1 June 1830, at Carr Street, Ipswich, Suffolk, the eldest son of Robert Ransome (1795&#150;1864), agricultural engineer, and his wife, Sarah Coleby (1794&#150;1863). He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23139/', "Robert Ransome (1753&#150;1830)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59149/', "Ransome family")</script>], the founder of the well-known firm of ironfounders and makers of agricultural implements in Ipswich.<br>
<br>Educated at the Friends' schools in Hitchin and York, at the age of sixteen Robert Charles entered the Ransome firm as an apprentice. He was made a partner in 1856. During the 1860s he took over most of the general management of the firm as the health of his uncle James Allen Ransome, then senior partner, began to deteriorate. Subsequently Robert Charles became senior partner, until the business was converted into a limited liability company in 1884, when he became the first chairman of Ransomes, Sims, and Jefferies Ltd.<br>
<br>Ransome's contributions to the firm's development were in general commercial management. He was credited by the <span class="italic">Implement and Machinery Review</span> for 1885&#150;6 with being &#145;the first of his firm to cultivate the foreign export&#146;. There had been sales overseas before his time, but he actively sought them out. One of his first jobs after being admitted to the partnership was an extensive tour of Europe and Egypt. He subsequently travelled widely, visiting such countries as Russia, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and the United States. The strength of the contacts established by his efforts was reflected by the fact that his death was reported in newspapers and magazines in Europe and America. He was similarly assiduous in promoting the firm's business at home, and took a lead in establishing its main strengths in ploughs and cultivating implements, steam engines, and threshing machines.<br>
<br>Ransome was a member of the council of the Smithfield Club and also of the council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (1875&#150;86). He was a founder member of the Agricultural Engineers' Association, established in 1875. Prominent in the local affairs of Ipswich, he was first elected to the borough council in 1859, served as mayor in 1867, and in 1877 became an alderman. He was president of the Ipswich Liberal Association from its foundation in 1873, and was invited on several occasions to stand for parliament but refused on the grounds that he would not be able to find time for parliamentary duties as well as managing his business. In his home town, however, Ransome was able to be chairman of the Ipswich school board for twelve years from its inception in 1871. A governor and a founder trustee of Framlingham College, he was also active in the founding of Ipswich middle school. He was a member of the Ipswich docks committee. He was appointed a justice of the peace for the borough in 1877, and for the county of Suffolk in 1883.<br>
<br>In 1854 Ransome married Sarah Jane, daughter of Richard W. Baker of Cottesmore, and they had a daughter. His wife died in 1856. In 1864 he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Gibb of London and Calcutta. They had three daughters and two sons. Deteriorating health caused Ransome to take nine months away from work in 1879&#150;80, which included a recuperative visit to Australia. He died, from aneurysm and asphyxia, at Belstead Road, Ipswich, on 5 March 1886, and was buried at Ipswich cemetery on 11 March. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Ransome's successor as head of the firm was his younger brother <a name="cosubject_48139"></a><span class="headword">James Edward Ransome</span>  (1839&#150;1905)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 13 July 1839 in Norwich Road, Ipswich. In 1856, aged seventeen, he entered upon his apprenticeship at the firm's Orwell works, and in 1868 he became one of the managing directors. On the death of his brother in 1886 he became joint chairman, with J. R. Jefferies, and was sole chairman from 1900 when Jefferies died. Ransome married Alice, daughter of Samuel Gross of Woodbridge, in 1863. The couple had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Whereas his brother was noted for his commercial achievements in the business, James Edward Ransome was more involved in the engineering side. There are several patents for improvements to ploughs, harrows, and lawnmowers in his name, and he presented papers on ploughs and their development, two of which were published. He was recognized also as a shrewd man of business. His first responsibilities within the firm after completing his apprenticeship were with the plough and implement department. He worked on the development of new designs of plough and the promotion of them through agricultural shows and ploughing matches. One of the early successes with which he was associated was the winning of the top prizes at the Royal Agricultural Society's show at Newcastle in 1864. The &#145;Newcastle&#146; design of plough subsequently became one of the most celebrated and commercially successful of the firm's ploughs. Ransome retained active interest and managerial control of the plough and implement department throughout his career, and took responsibility for the design of the new plough and implement shops at the Orwell works in 1900.<br>
<br>James Edward Ransome's other particular contribution to the firm's development was his promotion of the lawnmower from a &#145;plaything&#146; to a serious part of the firm's activities. New models were introduced from the late 1860s, and in 1876 Ransome oversaw the construction of a new lawnmower works. The culmination of his efforts was the successful introduction of the motor mower in 1902. The result of the commercial and technical leadership of Robert Charles and James Edward Ransome, together with J. R. Jefferies, was the success of their firm in withstanding the effects of the commercial and agricultural depression of the late nineteenth century. By the time James Edward Ransome died the company's workforce had grown to more than 2000.<br>
<br>A member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers from 1886 onwards, James Edward Ransome was also a member of the council of the Agricultural Engineers' Association. In addition he served on the councils of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (1886&#150;1905), and of the Bath and West of England and Southern Counties Society; and he belonged to the Suffolk chamber of agriculture. He was a member of Ipswich borough council and devoted his energies in local affairs particularly to sanitary improvements and education. Chairman of the governors of Ipswich endowed schools, he gave strong support (including financial contributions) to the building of a new science block at the grammar school. He was appointed a magistrate for the borough of Ipswich, but died before he could take the oath.<br>
<br>Ransome's political allegiances at first were with the Liberal Party, but he later became a Conservative. He was chairman of the Suffolk branch of the Tariff Reform League, and was elected president of the Ipswich Conservative Club a few weeks before he died. A keen huntsman, he was associated with the duke of Hamilton's harriers for some years. His other recreations included skating and golf.<br>
<br>James Edward Ransome died from cancer on 30 January 1905 at 4 Upper Wimpole Street, London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
