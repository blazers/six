<span class="headword">Simmons,  Samuel Foart</span>  (1750&#150;1813), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the only child of Samuel Simmons (1724&#150;1766), town clerk of Sandwich, Kent, and his first wife, Katherine (1726&#150;1750), daughter of Josiah Foart, was born on 6 March 1750, presumably in Sandwich. After education at a seminary in France, he studied medicine at Edinburgh and graduated MD at Leiden in 1776, with a treatise on measles. He then travelled, visiting continental universities and calling on Petrus Camper, Albrecht von Haller, and Voltaire. In Paris in 1778 he became a member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Royale de M&eacute;decine. Established in London, he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in the same year. Simmons had a paper published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1773, and on 4 November 1779 he was, on the recommendation of William Cullen, elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1780 he was appointed physician to the Westminster General Dispensary; and in 1781, physician to the Bethlem Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1780 Simmons was living in Bentinck Street, Cavendish Square, London. With his first wife, Susanna, he had a son, Richard Simmons (<i>bap</i>. 1781, <i>d</i>. 1846), who was baptized at St James, Piccadilly, on 20 January 1781. As a widower he married, second, on 24 December 1798, Susanna Lamb.<br>
<br>Simmons published a number of papers on a variety of subjects, mainly accounts of work by other people, reviews of current medical practice, or cases confirming earlier observations. He published as <span class="italic">Elements of Anatomy and the Animal Economy</span> (1775), a translation with a commentary of a work by Claude Person. He also published one volume of a projected <span class="italic">Anatomy of the Human Body</span> (1780). He provided no new medical insights. His contributions to medicine lay in his publication of the <span class="italic">Medical Register</span> in 1779, 1780, and 1783. Though unofficial and incomplete, the registers were of use both to the profession and to laymen, as they displayed the extent of medical provision in England, listing practitioners with their qualifications and hospitals, and noting the availability of charitable provision for the sick poor.<br>
<br>More important was Simmons's publication between 1781 and 1790 of eleven volumes of the <span class="italic">London Medical Journal</span>, and, between 1791 and 1800, eight volumes of <span class="italic">Medical Facts and Observations</span>. Other medical journals were published by professional societies, but Simmons offered medical men outside societies an opportunity to publish their interesting cases. The journals also contained reviews of new medical works, accounts of papers in other journals, &#145;medical and philosophical news&#146;, and quarterly catalogues of medical books; all of particular interest to provincial practitioners. In 1780 Simmons was president of the Medical Society of London, founded by J. C. Lettsom. When the president of the Society of Collegiate Physicians, William Hunter, died in 1783, Simmons, as a member of the society, though little acquainted with Hunter, offered a eulogy on him, which was subsequently published (1783).<br>
<br>When George III's illness returned in 1804, Simmons, as an expert on insanity, was called to look after him and on 15 May was gazetted physician-extraordinary to the king. His treatment relied on total restraint and the king loathed the &#145;horrible doctor&#146;, his son Richard, and the &#145;shabby attendants&#146; who assisted them. The king was unco-operative, and on 18 August the doctors were virtually dismissed. In 1810 the king was again taken ill and, in spite of opposition from the royal family, Simmons was sent for. He demanded sole management of the case, and when this was refused, he withdrew. The king remained ill and on 6 August 1811 Simmons with others was consulted, but would not give advice without seeing the patient. The queen objected particularly to Simmons's being allowed near the king, because previously &#145;his Conduct and Proceedings &hellip; had rendered him <i>justly</i> obnoxious to the King, to myself, &amp; to the whole Royal Family &amp; to every individual attendant&#146;  (Macalpine and Hunter, 161&#150;2). Nevertheless, they were allowed to observe but not to talk to the king. In January 1812 Simmons believed with others that the king would not recover, and the temporary regency was made permanent. Later that same year Simmons refused to give evidence at the trial of John Bellingham, who had assassinated the prime minister, Spencer Perceval, when an attempt was made to prove that Bellingham was insane; he was found guilty and executed.<br>
<br>Simmons had been elected to the Society of Antiquaries in 1791, and was an honorary member of the Manchester Philosophical Society, a member of the medical societies of Nancy, Montpellier, and Madrid, a foreign associate of the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine, and a correspondent, premi&egrave;re classe, of the Institut imp&eacute;rial. By contributing 100 guineas, he became a hereditary governor of the British Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts and a proprietor of the Royal Institution.<br>
<br>From 1790 until his death Simmons lived in Poland Street, Westminster. On 10 April 1813 he was taken ill with violent vomiting and died on 23 April. He was buried in St Clement's churchyard, Sandwich, on 2 May. He made an ample fortune from his private madhouse, but its location is not known. By his will he left to his wife the house in Poland Street and its furnishings, and &pound;23,900 in trust, provided that she did not remarry. Near relatives, six charities, and servants were all remembered. Land, houses, and premises in Sandwich went to his son, Richard Simmons, his residuary legatee. The latter was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BM (1806) and DM (1809), and was elected FRCP (1810), but became so wealthy that he had no further need to practise medicine.<br>
