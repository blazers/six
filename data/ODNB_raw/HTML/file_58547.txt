<span class="headword">Golombek,  Harry</span>  (1911&#150;1995), <span class="occ">chess player and writer on chess</span>, was born on 1 March 1911 at 200 Railton Road, Herne Hill, London, the younger son in the family of two sons and three daughters of Barnet Golombek (1877/8&#150;1943), a successful grocer, and his wife, Emma Sendak (<i>d</i>. 1967). All Golombek's grandparents came from a small Jewish community near Warsaw, migrating to England about 1903. Golombek won a scholarship to Wilson's Grammar School, Camberwell, where his ability at chess (first taught to him by his brother) became evident, as did a strong facility at languages and mathematics. His school won the London schools' team championship and in 1929 Golombek won the second London boys' championship (after finishing last the previous year). Golombek also began, but did not complete, a general degree at King's College, London, leaving in 1932.<br>
<br>For many decades Golombek was a fixture on the British chess scene. He played for England at nine chess olympiads (three times before the Second World War&#151;Warsaw 1935, Stockholm 1937, and Buenos Aires 1939) down to 1962, and captained the English team five times between 1952 and 1962. He became British champion three times, in 1947, 1949, and 1955, the last occasion at the relatively late age (for a chess champion) of forty-four. He lost the 1959 championship following a play-off. He also won a number of small international tournaments both before and after the war, such as Antwerp 1938, and Baarn 1948. In international chess, his greatest moment probably came with his very creditable result in the Bad Pyrmont zonal tournament of 1951, making him the first British player to qualify for the inter-zonal phase of the world championship round. He continued to play in chess tournaments until his seventies, tying for first place in the British veterans' championship in 1984. At the very highest level of international grandmaster play, however, it is clear that he could seldom successfully compete, although on a good day he could beat almost anyone.<br>
<br>Golombek's chess career was interrupted by the Second World War. Joining the Royal Artillery, with his linguistic and analytical gifts he (like other leading British chess players) was a natural candidate for Bletchley Park and the efforts by Britain's top code-breakers to crack the German military code with Enigma. At Bletchley he often played chess against Alan Turing, giving him queen odds but still beating him comfortably.<br>
<br>In 1945 Golombek again became a full-time chess player and writer, and in the latter capacity was for over thirty years probably the best-known writer on chess in the country. British chess at this time was in a paradoxical state. Britain had not produced a world championship contender for sixty years nor, indeed, many players of true international stature. Yet a flourishing chess scene existed, with many clubs, an excellent chess press, and a record of hosting some of the most notable chess tournaments of the previous half-century. The failure to produce many top-flight players was due, as much as anything, to the meagre rewards attainable in chess, and to the unfortunate image of chess in the popular mind as a game for prodigies and elderly eccentric savants. In the 1970s, however, a &#145;British chess explosion&#146; occurred, with England producing large numbers of highly talented younger players second to few countries in the world. Golombek's efforts as a chess writer and activist in popularizing chess and raising its visibility were responsible in significant measure for this improvement.<br>
<br>In 1945 Golombek became <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s chess correspondent, holding that position until his resignation in 1985, following a stroke the previous year. In addition, he wrote a weekly chess column for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> between 1955 and 1979, and was closely connected with the <span class="italic">British Chess Magazine</span>, briefly serving as its editor in 1938&#150;40. From 1949 until 1967 he was the magazine's games and overseas editor. An excellent and often memorable prose stylist, he wrote, edited, or translated more than thirty books on chess, ranging from the enormously popular <span class="italic">The Game of Chess</span> (1954), for novices, to an <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Chess</span> (1977). In contrast to accounts of more recent world championship matches by later writers, often pot-boilers which appeared as soon as the contest ended, Golombek's books on the 1948, 1954, and 1957 championship events were careful works of lasting value. Arguably his best works were his biographical games collections of the great Cuban world champion, <span class="italic">Capablanca's Hundred Best Games of Chess</span> (1947), which was widely praised, and <span class="italic">R&eacute;ti's Best Games of Chess</span> (1954), the only English-language account of the seminal Czech player and theorist, which Golombek regarded as his favourite book. He was also a regular contributor, between 1958 and 1964, to the BBC's <span class="italic">Radio Chess Magazine</span>, broadcasting on personalities of modern chess, a series which made the history and lore of chess known to thousands of listeners.<br>
<br>Golombek also enjoyed a distinguished career as a chess official and administrator. From 1952 until 1985 he served on the rules commission of FIDE, the international chess federation, which is responsible for the rules of chess, and was the British delegate to FIDE's annual conferences for most of this period. He served as official arbiter at many international tournaments and at six world championship matches in the 1950s and 1960s. All these matches took place in the Soviet Union between Soviet grandmasters, and Golombek's appointment, at the height of the cold war, was a remarkable one, and a tribute to his reputation for integrity. He was awarded the title of international master by FIDE in 1950 and of international arbiter in 1954. At the end of his career, in 1985, he was also given the title of international grandmaster emeritus. In 1966 he was appointed OBE, the first such appointment for &#145;services to chess&#146;.<br>
<br>With a prominent nose and ears, Golombek was instantly recognizable. Apart from chess, he had a wide range of interests, especially in music, theatre, opera, and ballet. He collected a large and diverse library, and his important holding of chess books went, after his death, to form the nucleus of the National Chess Library at the University Centre, Hastings. Many spoke highly of the kindness and encouragement he showed to younger players, and he left nearly two-fifths of his estate to further the encouragement of chess in Britain. While some critics regarded his writings as egocentric and opinionated, no one questioned his important role in the development of British chess. From 1944 he lived in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire. He died on 7 January 1995 in Dawn House residential home, South Park Crescent, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. Hitherto a lifelong bachelor, he quickly separated after a brief marriage contracted in the late 1980s.<br>
