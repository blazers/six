<span class="headword">Bower, Sir  (John) William  Nott-</span>  (1849&#150;1939), <span class="occ">police administrator</span>, was born on 20 March 1849 at 17 Micklegate, York, one of the children of John Bower, a barrister and leader of the bar in the ecclesiastical court of the province of York, and his wife, Charlotte, one among the fourteen children of General Sir William Nott GCB (1782&#150;1845), commander of the army which marched from Kandahar to Kabul in 1842, during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In 1858 the family moved to Wales, where his father bought some slate quarries, and in 1862 he was sent to Cheltenham College. From there he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1865, where he won the sword of honour; but after deciding to take up a police career he left the army at the end of 1872, when he managed to get a much sought-after cadetship in the Royal Irish Constabulary through the Liberal politician W. E. Forster, a friend of his father, who gave him a letter of introduction to Lord Hartington, chief secretary for Ireland. After training at the constabulary depot in Phoenix Park, Dublin, Nott-Bower took charge of a large district in the west of Ireland, and moved to Limerick in 1873, before returning to Dublin in 1876 to command a company at the constabulary depot. Again through influential friends of his father he was appointed chief constable of Leeds in 1878, and during his three years there handled the case of the notorious burglar Charles Peace, tried in Leeds for murder and hanged in 1879.<br>
<br>Nott-Bower was appointed head constable of Liverpool in 1881, and remained there until 1902. On 1 June 1889 he married Florence (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of Reginald Harrison, a Liverpool surgeon. Two of their five sons were killed in action in the First World War; of the others one, Sir John Nott-Bower (1892&#150;1972), followed his father into the police and served as commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1953 to 1958. Liverpool had the largest police force in the country outside London. With high levels of unemployment, over half the working population employed as casual labour in the docks, and large slum areas, the rate of violent crime was rising. In addition there were outbreaks of violence between members of the large Catholic and protestant Irish communities, and shortly before his arrival in Liverpool members of the Fenian Society had attempted to blow up the town hall. He also faced industrial conflict, most notably the great dock strike of 1890, when Nott-Bower, alarmed by the huge processions of dockers, advised the calling in of troops, to be stationed in the docks in order to prevent bloodshed. Not all his problems concerned the working classes: his most famous case was that of Mrs Maybrick, wife of a cotton merchant living in a fashionable suburb, who was sentenced to death in 1889 for poisoning her husband with arsenic, but who was reprieved by the home secretary.<br>
<br>Nott-Bower initiated a number of reforms in the Liverpool police force. With the help of his future father-in-law, Reginald Harrison, he organized the police ambulance system: it was the duty of the police to remove those injured or taken ill in the streets, but when he arrived in Liverpool, this could be done only by stretcher or handcart. In 1884 he persuaded the watch committee to supply horse-drawn ambulances, to be stationed at the hospitals, which would be part of the police force, and also set up a system of telegraph signal boxes to enable the police to summon the ambulances. He instituted the compulsory training of the Liverpool police in first aid, and was created a knight of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem in recognition of his services to first aid work. In 1886 he formed the Liverpool mounted police to deal with riots and public disorder, and also to control large crowds during public processions, as when Queen Victoria visited Liverpool in 1886. In 1891 he got the watch committee to buy three horse-drawn patrol wagons, on the lines of those introduced in some towns in the United States. He also founded the Liverpool police athletic club, and raised money to build the Liverpool and Bootle police orphanage, which opened in 1895. Although he put pressure on the watch committee to increase the pay of police constables, not enough was done until the implementation of the report of the 1919 Desborough committee. In 1885 his scheme to reorganize the two police divisions into six smaller ones was approved by the home secretary, and after the city boundaries were extended in 1895, increasing the area the police had to patrol from 277 miles of streets to 399 miles, he was able to increase the force from 1294 men to 1460. As his reputation grew, Nott-Bower was asked for advice by police forces as far away as Hong Kong and South Africa, and in 1897 he was asked to give evidence before the royal commission on the liquor licensing laws.<br>
<br>In March 1902 Nott-Bower was elected commissioner of police of the City of London, the second most prestigious position in the police service in the country. A much smaller force than the Metropolitan Police, the City police was responsible mainly for police arrangements at public functions in the Guildhall, including visits by members of the royal family and foreign heads of state. Nott-Bower made the arrangements for the royal progresses through the City during the 1902 and 1911 coronations, when he rode in front of the royal carriage until it passed the City boundary. He was involved in the battle of Sidney Street in January 1911. On that occasion members of the City and Metropolitan Police forces, reinforced by two squads of Scots Guards from the Tower of London, laid siege to a house in Sidney Street, Whitechapel; there two members of a gang of Russian anarchists, who had murdered three policemen during a raid on a jeweller's shop in Houndsditch, were surrounded. In 1911, in response to a circular from the home secretary, Nott-Bower began to recruit members of the City of London police reserve, who could be called on in case of emergency. They were valuable during the First World War, when many of the regular police were away on active service, helping to deal with the Zeppelin raids in 1915 and aeroplane bombing raids on the City later in the war. He was also confronted with the police strikes of 1918 and 1919, called by the National Union of Police and Prison Officers. He was in sympathy with the 1918 strike, acknowledging that the police were underpaid, but he dismissed all those who went on strike in 1919 because he believed that most of their grievances had already been remedied. He retired from the City police in 1925.<br>
<br>Nott-Bower was knighted in 1911 and created KCVO in 1918. He published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Fifty-Two Years a Policeman</span>, in 1926. He died on 4 February 1939 at his home, the Hotel Stuart, Richmond Hill, Richmond, Surrey, and was buried three days later at Bognor Regis, Sussex.<br>
