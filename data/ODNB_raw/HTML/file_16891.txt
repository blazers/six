<span class="headword">Lock <span class="st"> [Locke]</span>,  William</span>  (1732&#150;1810), <span class="occ">art connoisseur and patron</span>, is believed to have been the natural son of William Lock (<i>d</i>. 1761), MP for Grimsby, from whom he inherited considerable wealth, and Mrs Mary Wood (<i>d</i>. 1785) of Cavendish Square, London. The suggestion that he was of the same family as John Locke the philosopher is not proved. On 13 January 1767 he married Frederica Augusta (1750&#150;1832), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24798/', "Sir Luke Schaub (1690&#150;1758)")</script>. In 1749 Lock set out on the grand tour and in Venice met the landscape painter Richard Wilson, with whom he travelled to Rome. He now began to collect art: among his purchases were Claude's <span class="italic">Embarkation of St Ursula</span> (National Gallery, London), antique statuary including a bronze version of the <span class="italic">Discobulus</span> (Duncombe Park, Yorkshire), and terracotta models attributed at that time to Michelangelo.<br>
<br>It was, however, as a friend and patron of contemporary artists and men of letters that Lock was most respected. At Norbury Park, near Mickleham, Surrey, which he bought in 1774, the Locks were generous hosts to French &eacute;migr&eacute;s, including Madame de Sta&euml;l, who lived nearby at Juniper Hall; Fanny Burney, to whom Lock gave land for the building of Camilla Cottage on her marriage to M. d'Arblay, was a friend for life. So too was Thomas Lawrence, whom he introduced to the influential circle of J. J. Angerstein; his daughter Amelia married Angerstein's son John, MP for Camelford, in 1799. Lawrence first painted Lock in 1790 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts) and in 1829 he made a masterly portrait of Frederica Lock in old age (Nelson Atkins Museum, Kansas). The dining room of Lock's home, Norbury Park (which still stands), was painted with celebrated landscapes and <i>trompe-l'&#339;il</i> effects by George Barret the elder, G. B. Cipriani, and B. Pastorini. Lock's features suggest a refined, almost ascetic character but his cellar was fine and noted for its Etna Tokay which was said to have aphrodisiac qualities. He died at Norbury on 5 October 1810.<br>
<br>His elder son, <a name="cosubject_16891"></a><span class="headword">William Lock</span>  (1767&#150;1847), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in 1767. He distinguished himself as an artist of promise in his early years. Educated at the Revd William Gilpin's school at Cheam, he was also a pupil and&#151;like his father&#151;a friend of Henry Fuseli, who dedicated his lectures on painting to him. He is known principally for his mannered drawings in the Fuseli style, but he produced some paintings, and his <span class="italic">Death of Cardinal Wolsey</span> was engraved in stipple by Charles Knight in 1797. Lock sold Norbury in 1819 and lived afterwards principally in Rome and Paris. He married in 1800 the beautiful Elizabeth Jennings (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1846), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14758/', "Henry Constantine (Dog) Jennings (1731&#150;1819)")</script>, a fellow collector. There was one son, William, and a daughter, who married Joseph Blake, third Baron Wallscourt. William Lock the younger died in 1847.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_16890"></a><span class="headword">William Lock</span>  (1804&#150;1832), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, served as a captain in the Life Guards and was remarkable for his personal beauty. Lock eloped with Selina (1812&#150;1892), daughter of Admiral Richard Delap Tollemache, formerly Halliday; they were married soon after, in Brighton, on 7 December 1829. He published some illustrations to Byron which were lithographed by V. de Villeneuve. He was drowned in Lake Como on 14 September 1832; his daughter, Augusta Selina, married successively Ernest, Lord Burghersh; the duke of Santo Teodoro; and Thomas de Grey, sixth Baron Walsingham.<br>
