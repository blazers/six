<span class="headword">Montagu, Lord  Charles Greville</span>  (1741&#150;1784), <span class="occ">colonial governor and politician</span>, was born in England on 29 May 1741, the second son of Robert Montagu, third duke of Manchester (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1762), and his wife, Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1755), daughter of Edmund Dunch of Little Wittenham, Berkshire, and Elizabeth Godfrey. Through his mother's side Montagu was the great-nephew of John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough. Like most second sons of high-ranking aristocrats, he had the advantages of family connections and money, but did not have the convenience of a life that was mapped out as carefully as that of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19016/', "George Montagu, fourth duke of Manchester")</script>.<br>
<br>Montagu entered Christ Church, Oxford, in 1759 and married Elizabeth, daughter of James Balmer of Huntingdon, on 20 September 1765. They had one son and two daughters. He succeeded his elder brother as a member of parliament for Huntingdonshire in June 1762, and voted both with government and with the opposition before settling in as a supporter of the Rockingham administration. Rockingham rewarded Montagu in 1765 with an appointment as governor of South Carolina. After vacating his seat at the end of the session in December, Montagu set his affairs in order and set sail for Charles Town, arriving on 12 June.<br>
<br>Montagu's South Carolina was a land in turmoil. The combination of the proclamation of 1763, which severely restricted the colonies' westward expansion, and the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> of 1765, by which the British government sought directly to tax internal colonial American commerce, had created substantial tensions between the South Carolinians and the British. As an associate of the Rockingham administration, which had repealed the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, Montagu was received in South Carolina with great favour and expectation, but the initial rejoicing soon wore off as new problems with Britain arose and the colonies marched down the road to revolution. Moreover, the Carolinas had numerous internal problems, the worst of which was between the eastern counties, which were wealthier and disproportionately represented in the colony's assembly, and the poorer frontier counties, which erupted in the regulators' rebellion. As governor, Montagu sought to ease tensions by pardoning seventy-five of the failed rebellion's leaders, but this only agitated further the colonists of the more settled areas of the colony, who were becoming increasingly critical of British rule.<br>
<br>Although he remained the governor in title, Montagu effectively had given up by the summer of 1769, and on 29 July he set sail for England, where he worked as hard for a new position as the South Carolina assembly did for his recall. He returned briefly, arriving on 15 September 1771, but found a colonial assembly more hostile to British rule than ever. Part of the assembly's tax bill, put forward the day after his arrival, included the &pound;10,500 that the assembly had already advanced to John Wilkes's fund, for the support of that English radical's flagrant attacks on the king and his government. At stake was control of the colony's purse. Montagu was under strict instructions from the king and Wills Hill, first earl of Hillsborough, secretary of state for the American colonies, not to allow the assembly to dispose of public money without the consent of the governor and council. The assembly resented such interference as unacceptable infringements on its authority. In the face of such intransigence, Montagu had no choice but to dissolve the assembly time and again. Either unable or unwilling to suffer the situation any further, he left the colony without leave, and officially resigned his post in the first months of 1773.<br>
<br>Montagu made a bid in the general election of 1774 for a Southampton seat, but without the North administration's support was soundly defeated. With the assistance of his brother, he was placed in charge of raising a corps from among the American prisoners of war for the king's service against the colonies of Spain, which had entered the war in 1779. In New York he toured the prison ships and recruited upwards of 500 men to form the duke of Cumberland's provincial regiment. When it was disbanded in 1783 Montagu and a number of his men, along with thousands of other loyalists, resettled in Nova Scotia. He died in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 4 February 1784 and was buried there in St Paul's churchyard.<br>
