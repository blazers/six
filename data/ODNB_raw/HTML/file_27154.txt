<span class="headword">Thackeray,  George</span>  (1777&#150;1850), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Windsor on 10 October 1777 and baptized at the parish church on 23 November 1777. He was the fourth and youngest son of Frederick Thackeray (1737&#150;1782), a physician of Windsor, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter of Abel Aldridge of Uxbridge. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27153/', "Frederick Rennell Thackeray")</script> was his elder brother. George became a king's scholar at Eton College in 1792, and a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, in 1796, where he graduated BA in 1802, MA in 1805, and BD in 1813. He was a fellow of King's from 1800 to 1803, when he married (9 November 1803) a Miss Carbonell. He was ordained, and in 1801 was appointed assistant master at Eton, becoming lower master in 1809. On 4 April 1814 he was elected provost of King's College, and in the same year obtained the degree of DD by royal mandate.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, Thackeray married, in 1816, Mary Ann, eldest daughter of Alexander Cottin of Cheverells, Hertfordshire. Her death, in 1818, cast a gloom over Thackeray's subsequent life. He devoted much of his time to collecting rare books, and &#145;there was not a vendor of literary curiosities in London who had not some reason for knowing the provost of King's&#146;. He directed the finances of the college with great ability, and during his provostship an extensive building programme was carried out. But he was chiefly remembered as an obstinate opponent of reform, invoking his sole right, under the founder's statutes, to initiate business at college meetings to prevent the abolition of the privilege whereby Kingsmen could graduate without examination. He held the appointment of chaplain-in-ordinary to George III and to the three succeeding sovereigns.<br>
<br>Thackeray died in Wimpole Street, London, on 21 October 1850, and he was buried in a vault in the ante-chapel of King's College. His daughter, Mary Ann Elizabeth, bequeathed Thackeray's library to King's College on her death.<br>
