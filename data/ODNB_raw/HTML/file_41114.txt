<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ravenstein,  Ernst Georg</span>  (1834&#150;1913), <span class="occ">geographer and cartographer</span>, was born in Frankfurt am Main on 30 December 1834 into a family which had a long tradition of work in engraving and cartography. After studying at the Frankfurt Gymnasium and the St&auml;delsches Kunstinstitut, he emigrated to London in 1852 and soon became a pupil of August Petermann before, in 1855, accepting a post as cartographer with the topographic department of the War Office. In 1858 his ties with England were strengthened when he married Ada Sarah Parry of Bromley, Kent, fifty years of marriage to whom he celebrated with the publication of <span class="italic">A Life's Work</span> (1908). He began to write in 1856, publishing a work on Russian exploration (in English) and travel guides and general geographical handbooks (in German). He developed his interest in sport: he published works on gymnastics and was the founder in 1861 and the first president of the German Gymnastic Society (a post he held until 1871), as well as president of the London swimming club. He established the German gymnasium which opened at St Pancras in 1866 and collaborated with John Hulley and William Penny Brookes in founding the National Olympian Association, which held games in London in 1866 and Birmingham in 1867.<br>
<br>In 1872 Ravenstein retired from the War Office and, as he had declined the position of chief cartographer at the Royal Geographical Society after being refused permission to smoke on the premises, he had time to develop his own research interests. He continued to compile and publish maps, especially of Africa, many of which appeared in the publications of the Royal Geographical Society; he was an active member of the society, and, from 1894 to 1896, a member of council. He was also cartographic editor of the <span class="italic">Geographical Magazine</span>, a semi-official publication of the society. His relations with the society were not always smooth, notably when he was preparing his &#145;Map of eastern equatorial Africa&#146;, which took far longer than the society hoped, though its standard was exceptionally high. None the less, the society was his natural base, given his interest in both exploration and systematic geography. He was also on the council of the Royal Statistical Society and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and an active member of the International Geographical Union and several foreign learned societies. He lectured on physical geography at Bedford College in 1882&#150;3, being styled &#145;professor&#146;, but apparently with little success. He developed his interest in discovery, plotting the course of African exploration in his maps and helping to supply meteorological instruments to African settlers and missionaries and publishing their observations. His interest in the history of discovery led to his translation of the account of Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1898). In particular he developed his ideas on demography, notably his laws of migration, and it is for these that he is chiefly remembered. His laws reflected his familiarity with German advances in statistical and thematic mapping, notably those of Petermann, and his wish to explain geographical phenomena after detailed empirical observation. This, and work such as his study of Celtic languages in the British Isles (1879) based on questionnaire data and his maps of religious denominations in Britain, used methods ahead of their time.<br>
<br>In 1902 Ravenstein was awarded the first Victoria gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in recognition of his services to cartography and demography. In 1909 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of G&ouml;ttingen for his book on the Nuremberg geographer Martin Behaim (1908), a work which is still respected. He died on 13 March 1913 at Dr Schulze's Sanatorium at Hofheim in the Taunus Mountains in Germany. His dogged and loyal work for the Royal Geographical Society and his independent research were always of a high standard, but have not received the recognition they deserve in either England or Germany. Ravenstein was important in improving the standard of British cartography, and his work on migration has influenced demographers, sociologists, and economists, as well as geographers. His work has endured beyond that of many who achieved greater prominence in their lifetime. His &#145;Oarsman's and Angler's Map of the River Thames&#146; (1893) was reprinted in 1991, and shows the rediscovery of the lighter side of his work.<br>
