<span class="headword">O'Malley,  George</span>  (1780&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of George O'Malley and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke. He was a volunteer in the Castlebar yeomanry during the attack on the town by the French on 27 August 1798, and was present when it was attacked a fortnight later by a strong Irish rebel force, which was defeated by the yeomanry and a company of Fraser fencibles. O'Malley was confirmed as a lieutenant in the Castlebar yeomanry by Lord Cornwallis in recognition of his services, and soon after joined the North Mayo militia, from which he brought volunteers to the 13th regiment. He was appointed ensign on 23 February 1800, serving with the 13th at Ferrol and in Egypt, where he was severely wounded in the action of 13 March 1801, and afterwards at Malta and Gibraltar. For his success in recruiting in Ireland he received a company in the new 2nd battalion 89th regiment on 25 April 1805, and served with it until Colonel Henry Augustus Dillon raised the 101st regiment, in which O'Malley was appointed major. In Mayo he assisted in forming the regiment. He served with it in Ireland and Jersey, and was dispatched with 300 men to Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1808, when war with the United States was imminent, and the Americans were reportedly collecting a large force near that place. For his services in command of the garrison, and the exemplary conduct of the troops under his command, he received the freedom of the city on 19 July 1809. As major, he commanded the regiment for four years in Jamaica, obtaining the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel on 4 June 1813. (The regiment was disbanded as the 100th in 1817.)<br>
<br>O'Malley's applications for employment in Europe were initially unsuccessful, but on 27 April 1815 he was appointed to the 2nd battalion 44th foot, and commanded it in Picton's division at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. On 18 June the battalion lost very heavily, being reduced to five officers and 200 men. O'Malley was twice wounded and had two horses shot under him, but he remained in command, for which he was made CB. He commanded the battalion in France until it was disbanded in 1816, when he was placed on half pay. He was appointed major 38th regiment on 12 August 1819 and lieutenant-colonel 88th Connaught Rangers on 2 June 1825. He commanded that regiment, which he brought to a fine state of discipline, until promoted major-general on 23 November 1841. He died in London on 16 May 1843, and was buried at Murisk Abbey, co. Mayo, Ireland. A statue was erected to him at Castlebar, co. Mayo.<br>
