<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pope,  Jane</span>  (1744&#150;1818), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the daughter of William Pope (1707/8&#150;1784), barber and wigmaker for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, until his retirement in 1782. According to a manuscript note on the Pope family, now in the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University, Jane Pope was born on 20 January 1744 in Little Russell Street, London; this seems to be confirmed by the baptism of Jane Pope, daughter of William and Susanna, on 26 January 1744 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. Nothing is known of her mother, beyond the fact that she had at least three sons and two daughters. To judge by the terms of Jane Pope's will, though, the family was a close one. Jane and her sister Susanna, neither of whom married, lived together for much of their adult lives, caring, in the latter stages, for a possibly orphaned niece, who married in the year following Jane's death. William Pope prospered by an association with the theatre that necessarily had an impact on his children. His shop in Little Russell Street was adjacent to the stage door of Drury Lane, and on 3 December 1756 Jane and one of her brothers featured in the novelty production of David Garrick's farce <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>, in which the Lilliputians were all played by children and Gulliver by the adult Astley Bransby. There is no evidence that William Pope provided his daughters with a formal education, but Jane's surviving letters are literate and fashionably allusive, evidence in themselves of the sophistication of Garrick's Drury Lane company, of which she was a full member from 27 October 1759, when she played Corinna in Sir John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Confederacy</span>. With the exception of the single season of 1775&#150;6, she remained at Drury Lane until her retirement at the end of the 1807&#150;8 season, thus giving a half-century of service for which there are few parallels.<br>
<br>Playing Flippanta in <span class="italic">The Confederacy</span> when Jane Pope made her adult d&eacute;but was Catherine (Kitty) Clive, whose career Pope, in many ways, shadowed and several of whose roles she inherited when Clive retired. The friendship that developed between the old actress and the d&eacute;butante was an unusual one. It lasted until Clive's death in 1785, and was memorialized when Pope oversaw the erection of a monument to her in the churchyard at Twickenham. In 1790 Kitty Clive's brother, James Raftor, left &pound;250 each to Jane and her sister Susanna and appointed them executors of his will. It may have been on Kitty Clive's advice that Jane confined her acting career to comedy. It was a career that never reached the heights or plumbed the depths. Like Clive before her, she began by playing pretty young coquettish women, or soubrettes, such as Biddy in Garrick's <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span> and Prue in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> (1759&#150;60) and the title role in George Colman's <span class="italic">Polly Honeycomb</span> and Lucinda in Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Englishman in Paris</span> (1760&#150;61). She played these parts with sufficient spirit to attract praise from the demanding Charles Churchill in <span class="italic">The Rosciad</span> (1761). By the time she came to select a role for her benefit at the end of the 1761&#150;2 season, however, she was confident enough of her maturity to plump for Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</span>, and in the 1762&#150;3 season the Drury Lane management trusted her with the flighty but knowing Widow Belmour in Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">The Way to Keep Him</span>.<br>
<br>Pope was now receiving a salary of &pound;4 per week, an amount inferior only to that of the star actresses in the company. In the major success of the 1765&#150;6 season, Colman's and Garrick's <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>, she created the secondary role of Miss Sterling, and on 4 December 1767 she played Polly Peachum in John Gay's frequently revived <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. She was, according to contemporary critics, an indifferent singer, though a talented dancer until a rapid increase in weight during the 1770s led her to abandon dancing. She was also celebrated by audiences for the clarity of her speaking voice and by theatrical colleagues for her even-temperedness. Her on-stage reliability was reflected in the prudence with which she conducted her private life. Of her two known romantic attachments, her engagement to the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13515/', "Charles Holland the elder (1733&#150;1769)")</script> was broken off in 1768 when Holland, a well-known philanderer, was found in a boat on the Thames with the actress Sophia Baddeley. Her second engagement, to John Pearce (1727&#150;1797), a stockbroker, ended (at an unknown date) when Pearce made it clear that, as his wife, Pope would be expected to abandon her stage career.<br>
<br>The single interruption to Jane Pope's Drury Lane career followed a dispute with Garrick over salary at the end of the 1774&#150;5 season. She was, by then, receiving &pound;8 per week, and Garrick, not without some misgivings, rejected her demand for &pound;10. Out of work in London, Pope performed in Dublin through the 1775&#150;6 season, Garrick's last at Drury Lane, but the relationship between actress and manager was fundamentally warm enough to survive the salary dispute. Garrick wrote to her in February 1776, expressing his eagerness to secure her place with the new managers of the theatre, and she replied fondly, with an agreement to settle for her former salary. As a result of Garrick's negotiations she was back at Drury Lane in good time to create the role of Mrs Candour at the sensational opening of Richard Brinsley Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> on 8 May 1777. From then on, her major contribution to comedy was in frumpish parts such as Audrey in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> and eccentric older women such as Mrs Heidelberg in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>. For her new manager, Sheridan, she created the comically exaggerated Tilburina in <span class="italic">The Critic</span> (1779&#150;80) and played Mrs Malaprop and the title role in revivals of <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1796&#150;7) and <span class="italic">The Duenna</span> (1801&#150;2). Her last original role was as the Dowager Lady Morelove in the ill-fated single performance of Sophia Lee's <span class="italic">The Assignation</span> on 28 January 1807. She gave her farewell performance on 26 May 1808, as Deborah Dowlas in George Colman the younger's <span class="italic">The Heir at Law</span>, taking her leave of Drury Lane with a speech in the character of Audrey.<br>
<br>Jane Pope's retirement must have been comfortable. Living with her sister Susanna, or living alone, she amassed sufficient wealth to bequeath upwards of &pound;5000 to Susanna, as well as various properties, including the house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, where she had lived from 1782 until her retirement from the stage. Her last years were spent, initially at no. 25 and then at no. 17 St Michael's Place, in Brompton, where she died on 30 July 1818. She was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 10 August 1818.<br>
