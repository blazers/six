<span class="headword">Weaver,  Thomas</span>  (1616&#150;1662), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Worcester, the son of Thomas Weaver. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 21 March 1634, graduating BA in 1637 and MA in 1640. He became a chaplain or petty canon at Christ Church Cathedral in 1641, and stayed in Oxford following the outbreak of the civil war.<br>
<br>As a member of Christ Church in the late 1630s and early 1640s, Weaver was heir to a vibrant and expansive poetic tradition. During the early years of the civil war he wrote most of the lyric poems which appear in the extensive collection now in the Bodleian (MS Rawlinson poet. 211). Weaver's poetry was typical of royalist verse of the early 1640s&#151;politically engaged, satirical, and witty. He had a modest reputation, and several of his early poems were circulated in Oxford manuscripts. Furthermore, &#145;Zeal Over-heated&#146;, which deals with the comic consequences of a fire in an Oxford puritan merchant's shop, was published as part of John Taylor's <span class="italic">A Three-Fold Discourse betweene Three Neighbours</span> (1642). The poem particularly attacks the avaricious and hypocritical character of the puritan and his brother.<br>
<br>Weaver was ejected from his position at Christ Church Cathedral by the parliamentary visitation in 1648. He may have been imprisoned also at this time: a poem entitled &#145;A Song in Prison&#146; appears in his manuscript of poetry from the 1640s. This verse asserts:<blockquote>
<div>no foule offence,<br>
</div>
<div>But Loyaltie unto my King<br>
</div>
<div>Caus'd my Restraint.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He fled Oxford, and Anthony Wood says that he &#145;shifted from place to place and lived upon his wits&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.622). His whereabouts until the Restoration are unclear. A verse letter in the Bodleian manuscript &#145;From Llangiby Castle in Monmouthshire to Sir Evan Lloyd in London&#146; seems to indicate that he was in Wales for a period. He evidently spent much time wandering between loyalist country houses, as there is a poem in the 1640s manuscript written from Lengiby Castle and also a lyric in his <span class="italic">Songs and Poems</span> (1654) &#145;To the Three Incomparable Ladies at K. Castle&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Songs and Poems of Love and Drollery, by T. W.</span> was dedicated &#145;To my most obliging friend E. M. Esquire&#146; and the &#145;Epistle Dedicatory&#146; asserts that<blockquote>It was not by my endeavor, but permittance only, that these trifles were preferred to the Press; nor had the perswasions used procured so much from me, but that upon strict Examination, I conceived them to be good for nothing, but to be printed.</blockquote>The collection includes lyrics, ballads, carols, and pastoral dialogues; the majority of the poems appear in the 1640s manuscript. The poems, which are very political, include &#145;To Sylvia Going to an Enemies Quarters&#146;, &#145;An Epitaph on Major Owen and Captain Edward Wynne&#146;, and &#145;On Mauricia's Wound which she Received from a Round-Head&#146;. The poem &#145;Rotundos&#146; mocks the &#145;pretty tricks&#146; of the roundheads. However, as printed in 1654, the volume betrays a royalist sense of loss: &#145;For since the late Deluge of Ignorance overflowed this Land, it fares with Books, as with Men; the light and frothy float and flourish, whilst the Grave and Solid sink and perish.&#146; The updated version of &#145;Zeal Overheated&#146; changes the ending of the ballad as printed in 1642, adopting a more defiant tone:<blockquote>
<div>God blesse this Land, and keep it Aye<br>
</div>
<div>Against all that oppose:<br>
</div>
<div>And let the Supream head bear sway<br>
</div>
<div>In stead o'th Supream nose.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The volume concludes with &#145;An Epitaph on the Right Honorable the Lord Byron, Buried in France&#146; and the sarcastic &#145;An Epithalamium, upon the Late Nuptial Act&#146; which attacks the puritan attempts to unify religion and the law:<blockquote>
<div>Justice and Priesthood by Supreme Decree,<br>
</div>
<div>For mutual helps sake must remarried be.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The printing of these poems led to Weaver's being arrested and tried for treason; he was only saved by the judge who, according to Wood, advised the jury to acquit this &#145;scholar and a man of wit&#146;.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Weaver was appointed by Charles II as the excise collector for Liverpool. A petition for the retrieval of moneys paid to &#145;[the late] Thos. Weaver, late collector of customs at Liverpool&#146;, probably refers to an old case  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 346). Weaver has sometimes been credited with the writing of <span class="italic">Plantagenets Tragicall Story</span> which is in fact by Thomas Wincoll  (Wing, <span class="italic">STC</span>, 672). Weaver died in Liverpool on 3 January 1662.<br>
