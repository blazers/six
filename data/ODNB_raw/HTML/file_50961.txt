<span class="headword">Dawes,  William</span>  (1762&#150;1836), <span class="occ">astronomer and colonial administrator</span>, probably born at Portsmouth, was the eldest son of Benjamin Dawes, clerk of works in the Office of Ordnance in Portsmouth. He was gazetted second lieutenant of marines in September 1779, and was wounded in the <i>Resolution</i> (74 guns) during action against the French in Chesapeake Bay in September 1781. In 1786 he volunteered for service in the first fleet going to New South Wales. He had hoped to get posted ashore but there were no vacancies, so he was appointed to the marine detachment in the <i>Sirius</i> (22 guns). However, William Bayly, headmaster of the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, who had been Captain Cook's astronomer, wrote to Sir Joseph Banks recommending Dawes for a similar job, citing his knowledge of languages, botany, mineralogy, and also astronomy. Subsequently the board of longitude appointed him their official astronomical observer and lent him instruments appropriate for setting up an observatory in the new colony. He was asked especially to look out for a comet expected in 1788 or 1789.<br>
<br>The first fleet sailed in May 1787 under the command of the future governor of New South Wales, Captain Arthur Phillip. After leaving the Cape of Good Hope, Dawes and Captain Phillip transferred from the <i>Sirius</i> to the armed tender <i>Supply</i>, and pushed on ahead of the main fleet to land at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Dawes was thus one of the first to land in the new colony. Having decided that Port Jackson a few miles to the north was a better place for the new settlement, Phillip founded the city which he named Sydney on 26 January. Soon after, when news reached Sydney that two French frigates, the <i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astrolabe</i> under the command of La P&eacute;rouse, were anchored in Botany Bay, Dawes accompanied John Hunter, captain of the <i>Sirius</i>, from Sydney to Botany Bay to offer any assistance that might be needed, and spent the night in the <i>Boussole</i>. The two French ships sailed northwards on 10 March, never to be seen again by white men.<br>
<br>From March 1788 Dawes was employed ashore as engineer and surveyor, and by early July had been discharged from the <i>Sirius</i>. He had already begun to build an observatory on what became known as Dawes Point on the west side of Sydney Cove, then known as Point Maskelyne. He saw no comet but made many other observations, principally for settling latitude and longitude. As the new colony's engineer and surveyor&#151;with no extra remuneration&#151;he constructed gun batteries at the entrance to Sydney Cove, and laid out the government farm and the first streets and allotments in Sydney and Parramatta. Often with Watkin Tench, he went on many expeditions in the mountains, where his surveying training and skills were invaluable.<br>
<br>Dawes contemplated settling in Australia but, having fallen out with Governor Phillip, he had to return to England in 1791 and was soon recruited by the anti-slavery evangelicals Wilberforce and Henry Thornton to go to Sierra Leone, where he served as governor in 1792&#150;4 and again in 1795&#150;6. A strong evangelical, he became a member of the Clapham Sect.<br>
<br>In January 1799 he succeeded William Wales as mathematical master at Christ's Hospital. He had married Judith Rutter (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1800) in July 1794, and they had a daughter, Judith, and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7337/', "William Rutter Dawes")</script>, born in Christ's Hospital on 19 March 1799, who was to become a distinguished astronomer; and Macaulay, who died young (named after Zachary Macaulay, a colleague in Sierra Leone and father of the historian).<br>
<br>Dawes resigned from Christ's Hospital on 7 November 1800 to return to Sierra Leone, where he was again governor from 1801 to 1803. He left William Rutter in the care, first, of his grandfather in Portsmouth, then, from 1807, of Thomas Scott, a colleague at the Church Missionary Society, for whom Dawes worked in England from 1804 to 1808. In 1813, at Wilberforce's suggestion, he went to Antigua to work for the anti-slavery cause, taking his daughter (who later married there) but not his son. Either in Antigua, after 1813, or around 1811, before he left England, he married Grace Gilbert. He died in penury in Antigua in 1836, survived by his second wife. A novel by Jane Rogers based on Dawes's life in Australia, which contains much historical information about him, was published in 1995 under the title <span class="italic">Promised Lands</span>.<br>
