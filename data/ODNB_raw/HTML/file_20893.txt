<span class="headword">O'Shaughnessy,  Arthur William Edgar</span>  (1844&#150;1881), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at 46 Pembroke Square, London, on 14 March 1844, the son of Oscar William O'Shaughnessy, a painter of animal pictures who died of consumption in 1848, and his wife, Louisa Anne Deacon (1813&#150;1896), a schoolteacher. Arthur and his younger brother, Oscar, grew up in Kensington, where the family lived together with Louisa's eldest sister, Caroline. The boys were educated privately.<br>
<br>In June 1861 Arthur O'Shaughnessy was appointed a transcriber in the department of printed books in the library of the British Museum, and in August 1863 he was promoted to an assistantship in the zoological department. Both positions, it seems, were attained partly through the patronage of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a Conservative MP. The transfer gave great offence to naturalists and was condemned by a resolution passed at a meeting of the Zoological Society. O'Shaughnessy knew very little about natural history; in 1870 he narrowly escaped being sacked for his consistently bad work, but Bulwer-Lytton's intervention saved him. Thereafter, he became such a good authority on herpetology (the study of reptiles) that he was made responsible for that section of the annual zoological record. His death in 1881 was deplored as a loss to science by Dr Albert G&uuml;nther, the head of the museum department to which O'Shaughnessy belonged.<br>
<br>Also in 1870, O'Shaughnessy published, to acclaim, his <span class="italic">Epic of Women and other Poems</span>, illustrated by his friend J. T. Nettleship. <span class="italic">Lays of France</span>, which appeared two years later, was chiefly adapted from the poems of the twelfth-century poet Marie de France. His work was heavily influenced by French romanticism and, fluent in the language, he spent most of his holidays in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1873 O'Shaughnessy's protector, Bulwer-Lytton, died. Finding him in tears at work, and remembering visits to Bulwer-Lytton by a very well-dressed woman who always wore a veil, O'Shaughnessy's friend Edmund Gosse, then a transcriber, leapt to the conclusion that Bulwer-Lytton was O'Shaughnessy's natural father. In fact, Bulwer-Lytton's interest in the young man arose from his relationship with O'Shaughnessy's aunt Laura, as, after his separation from Rosina Bulwer-Lytton, he and Laura were married in all but name. Nevertheless, the rumour was not laid to rest until after the deaths of all concerned.<br>
<br>O'Shaughnessy married Eleanor Kyme Marston, daughter of the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18165/', "John Westland Marston (1819&#150;1890)")</script>, on 26 June 1873. He published <span class="italic">Music and Moonlight</span> (1874) to lukewarm reviews, and then he and his wife wrote a book of tales for children: <span class="italic">Toyland</span> (1875). Their first child, Westland Kyme, was born 31 July 1874 but died two months later; a second son also died in infancy. On 8 February 1879 Eleanor herself died, of cirrhosis of the liver, and her husband deplored her death in an elegy of great beauty. He was working as the English correspondent of <span class="italic">Le Livre</span>, and planning to remarry, when, after a few days' illness, he died of a lung infection at his London home, 163 Golbourne Road, Notting Hill, on 30 January 1881. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery in London on 3 February.<br>
<br>O'Shaughnessy's posthumously published poems, <span class="italic">Songs of a Worker</span> (1881), were, apart from a few poems on sculpture, criticized as repetitious. His contemporaries tended to agree that his reputation suffered from a lack of editorial rigour in selection. In general, though, his musicality was praised, but not his intelligence or imagination. His most lasting poem, set to music by Edward Elgar, is probably the &#145;Ode&#146; from <span class="italic">Music and Moonlight</span>, which begins:<blockquote>
<div>We are the music makers<br>
</div>
<div>And we are the dreamers of dreams.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
