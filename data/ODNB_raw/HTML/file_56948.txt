<span class="headword">Volk,  Magnus</span>  (1851&#150;1937), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born on 19 October 1851 at 35 (now 40) Western Road, Brighton, Sussex, the eldest child of Magnus Volk (1824&#150;1869), a clockmaker from Langenbach, Germany, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maynard (1825&#150;1909). There were also six daughters, of whom five survived their father. Volk was educated partly at home and at Philip Capon's proprietary school, one of many elementary schools in Brighton. Although he learned basic clockmaking from his father, he was apprenticed to a scientific instrument maker, but this was cut short when his father died in 1869.<br>
<br>With Volk's help Sarah Volk carried on her late husband's shop, which in 1867 had moved to 51 Preston Street. He sought new sources of supply in Paris as soon as it was safe to travel there after the Franco-Prussian War. However, new technology interested him far more than old, and in the early 1870s he designed and produced an electric telegraph instrument for household use. In 1877 he was described as &#145;telegraph apparatus manufacturer&#146; and when, on 8 April 1879, he married Anna (<i>b</i>. 1857), the daughter of Frederick Banfield, a Brighton merchant, his occupation was recorded as &#145;electrician&#146;. He wrote articles about electricity, which, combined with his mechanical ability, led to work for an armaments firm, the London Ordnance Works. He built a short telephone line linking his home with a friend's, and in 1880 installed electric lighting in his home, using a dynamo from Siemens of Woolwich and a Crossley gas-engine. In 1881 he successfully demonstrated a fire alarm system, and was appointed agent to the United Telephone Company, which opened an exchange in Brighton in 1882 for which Volk supplied equipment. A large electric light installation in the Royal Pavilion was completed in 1883.<br>
<br>Volk then had time on his hands, and his thoughts turned to an electric railway. Electric traction was first demonstrated in Berlin in 1879 and he would have known of early experiments. He had a set of generating equipment spare as his house now used mains electricity, and an electric motor from a cancelled contract. On 14 June 1883 he wrote to Brighton corporation asking for permission to lay a 2 ft gauge line along Madeira Road. This was granted and Volk's Electric Railway opened on 4 August 1883, the first permanent electric railway in Great Britain. Following storm damage the line was relaid in 1884 to a 2 ft 8&frac12; in. gauge.<br>
<br>Volk's next transport venture was an electric dog-cart in 1887, which led to an order by the sultan of Turkey. This is believed to have been the first export order for a British motor car. The motors for these vehicles were supplied by Moritz Immisch of London. By now Volk was in severe financial difficulties, and he agreed to install and manage the charging stations for an electric launch service Immisch was planning on the River Thames. Having filed for bankruptcy in January 1888, he was discharged in August 1891 and returned to Brighton in 1892. He was able to devote more time to the railway, and another new venture&#151;the Brighton and Rottingdean Seashore Electric Tramroad. This bizarre line, involving a car mounted on four stilts running on a pair of tracks laid on the seabed, and advertised as offering &#145;a sea voyage on wheels&#146;, was officially opened on 28 November 1896. Although abandoned in January 1901, this venture demonstrated the versatility of electric traction.<br>
<br>In 1901 Magnus Volk Ltd was registered to take over Volk's businesses to give financial stability, and his eldest son, Herman, became a director, gradually taking responsibility for managing the railway. Herman was particularly interested in aviation, and in 1913 established a seaplane station near the line, of which Magnus did not quite approve. In 1903 Magnus moved to Hassocks, seven miles north of Brighton, where he was an active member of the Congregational church and ran the children's Sunday school. In June 1914 he moved back to Brighton. He managed the railway during Herman's absence in the First World War, and also supplied X-ray and other equipment to a military hospital in Brighton.<br>
<br>In later life Volk, who had a daughter and six sons, was an active member of the Church of England and a generous supporter of the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children. After taking part in the opening of the rebuilt terminus of his railway at Black Rock on 7 May 1937, he died peacefully at his home, 38 Dyke Road, Brighton, on 20 May 1937. He was buried on 25 May in the churchyard at Ovingdean near Brighton. Shortened at one end and greatly extended to the east, the line built by Volk remains in business during the summer and is the world's oldest electric railway. In 1933, on its fiftieth anniversary, it was described as &#145;an epoch in the history of Brighton. It is even a milestone in the progress of the world&#146;  (Volk, 223). Although Volk is credited with numerous inventions and patents, his importance lies in his practical application of new technologies which were later taken for granted.<br>
