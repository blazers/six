<span class="headword">Maccall,  William</span>  (1812&#150;1888), <span class="occ">writer and public lecturer</span>, was born in Largs, Ayrshire, on 25 February 1812, the eldest child of six sons and six daughters of John Maccall (<i>b</i>. 1793), a builder, and his wife, Elizabeth Murdoch (<i>b</i>. 1792). He later told the biographer Francis Espinasse (1823&#150;1912) that he enlisted in the dragoons but was soon bought off. Then, intended for the ministry in the evangelical United Secession church, to which his parents belonged, he matriculated in the University of Glasgow in 1827. By the time he left the university in 1833 doubt had set in, and he was attracted by the preaching of the Revd George Harris (1794&#150;1859), the Unitarian minister at Glasgow, who secured his appointment as minister at Greenock in 1833&#150;4.<br>
<br>Maccall then entered a theological seminary in Geneva, where he learned German and became an ardent disciple of Rousseau. On returning to England he supplied pulpits in London, and in 1837 became minister at Moor Lane Chapel, Bolton, where Harris had been the first and only truly successful pastor. By 1840 the declining congregation was unable to pay a stipend, and Maccall resigned. After a brief involvement with the anti-corn law and Chartist agitations, he failed in candidacies at Bristol and Brixton. A visit to James Forrest (<i>d</i>. 1858), minister at Devonport, whom he had known at Glasgow and who had succeeded him at Greenock, led to his appointment at Crediton, in Devon, in 1841. After three months he moved to Coseley but, disliking it, returned to Crediton, where he preached until 1846, supplementing his stipend of &pound;100 by teaching languages.<br>
<br>While at Bolton, Maccall had courted Mary (1819&#150;1837), fifth child and fourth daughter of John Haselden (1785?&#150;1835), a cotton manufacturer who belonged to Moor Lane. Five months after her death, at the age of eighteen, he proposed to her older sister Alice (1813&#150;1878); they were married on 3 March 1842, helped by a small legacy from her uncle. Any expectations from the Haselden inheritance collapsed with the failure of the family firm following a disastrous mill fire in November 1842. Their only child, Elizabeth, was born the next year.<br>
<br>In 1839, in a sermon published as <span class="italic">The Clergy and the Nation</span>, Maccall told the Unitarian congregation at Todmorden that they must demand that their ministers preach and act in politics or choose those who would. He later insisted that he did not preach politics at Crediton, making only appropriate references to the game laws and the corn laws; but one member of the congregation organized a campaign against his &#145;indecent political declamation&#146;. While the congregation supported their minister, his stipend was reduced to &pound;40 by what he alleged was the trustees' financial mismanagement. He resigned in mid-summer 1846 and moved to London, supplying pulpits&#151;&#145;of the least <i>tight-laced</i> Unitarian species&#146; Carlyle called them  (T. Carlyle to O. Blewitt, 6 March 1853, Archives of the Royal Literary Fund)&#151;and trying to maintain himself and his family by writing and lecturing.<br>
<br>The most curious surviving instance of Maccall's potboiling is a collection of materials for the history of amber, translated mostly from German and published in <span class="italic">Cope's Tobacco Plant</span>, the house organ of a Liverpool tobacco manufacturer. More seriously, in 1854 he translated Spinoza's <span class="italic">Tractatus politicus</span>, a French textbook in biology in 1877, and <span class="italic">Christian Legends</span>, from the collection by Karl Eduard von Bulow (1803&#150;1853), in 1884. He had mixed success in writing for periodicals, quarrels or changes in editorship cutting short his contributions to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, <span class="italic">The Critic</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Many of his reviews and essays were subsequently republished in books.<br>
<br>A tall, erect man, with a wonderful conversational gift, Maccall profoundly impressed John Sterling (1806&#150;1844), who met him on a stagecoach in 1842 and whose letter written at the time led in 1848 to a meeting with Thomas Carlyle, who went out of his way to help with connections. When Maccall suffered a serious illness and mental collapse, Carlyle gave impressive support for an application in 1853 to the Royal Literary Fund that resulted in a grant of &pound;40. Carlyle continued to think well of Maccall, though he described him as &#145;harsh-edged, as a rusty <i>lipped</i> [broken-edged] razor&#146; and suspected that his difficulties with his congregations had been largely of his own making (T. Carlyle to M. Carlyle, 13 Feb 1853; Fielding, <span class="italic">Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</span>, 28 2000, 40). Certainly his aggressiveness and savagery alienated editors and some well-disposed friends, and the continued sympathy of both John Stuart Mill and George Eliot did not prevent his harshly criticizing their work in publications such as <span class="italic">The Newest Materialism</span> (1873). Espinasse remarked that, while Maccall could be indulgent with foreign writers, he &#145;seemed to regard as a criminal offence the mere writing of an English book&#146;  (Espinasse, 251).<br>
<br>Predictably, these qualities were better adapted to the lecture platform, although even there Maccall's self-absorption could alienate audiences. He had given up the Unitarian connection by the 1850s, distressed, like his friend Forrest, by what he came to see as Unitarian frigidity, shallowness, and narrowness  (Maccall, <span class="italic">Via crucis</span>, 21), but he remained a Christian of a cloudy and expansive sort, suggested in the medieval ideals set out in the preface to his 1884 translation of <span class="italic">Christian Legends</span>.<br>
<br>Most of Maccall's subsequent work must, however, be seen as flowing from <span class="italic">The Elements of Individualism</span>, thirty-five lectures given to his Crediton congregation in 1845&#150;6 and published in book form by John Chapman in 1847. This elaborate credo, rambling and self-indulgent, is a call to the fullest individual development, to reveal God existing in every man and woman, and a passionate plea for toleration. John Stuart Mill saw the work as a major predecessor of his <span class="italic">On Liberty</span> (1859), one of the books Maccall reviewed so stringently. He also revealed a Carlylean prophetic streak, hailing the hero both as individual&#151;notably in his 1857 panegyric on Charles James Napier (1782&#150;1853)&#151;and as archetype in <span class="italic">The Agents of Civilization</span> (1840; repr. 1893), shallow, inspirational ruminations on the hero, poet, priest, artist, prophet, philosopher, apostle, and martyr. In <span class="italic">National Missions</span> (1855) each of the great national cultures is matched to a single characteristic: Egypt and religion, Greece and beauty, Palestine and faith, Italy and art, France and manners, England and science, and so on.<br>
<br>In 1878 Alice Maccall died after long suffering from a blood disorder. <span class="italic">Via crucis</span> (1880) is a husband's passionate lament and a harrowing revelation of his own life of failure and misery. He died on 19 November 1888 at his home, Fountain Villa, Woolwich Road, Bexleyheath, Kent.<br>
