<span class="headword">Linton,  David Leslie</span>  (1906&#150;1971), <span class="occ">geographer and geomorphologist</span>, was born on 12 July 1906 at 883 Old Kent Road, London, the second of three children of Samuel James Linton, master grocer, and Elizabeth Baird Kennedy. His parents were immigrants from northern Ireland. He was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham School and then went up to King's College, University of London, on a scholarship to read for a general honours degree in chemistry, physics, and geology. He was awarded a first class in 1926 and then proceeded to a special honours degree in which he obtained a first class in geography in 1927. He stayed on at King's, where he succeeded S. W. Wooldridge as demonstrator. In 1929 he moved to Edinburgh University and remained there until 1945, although during the Second World War he was on photo-reconnaissance duties with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, where he held the rank of squadron leader.<br>
<br>In 1945 Linton was appointed professor of geography at Sheffield University, and then in 1958 professor of geography at Birmingham University, where he remained until his sudden death in 1971. Linton held a range of national positions including the editorship of <span class="italic">Geography</span> (from 1947 to 1965), the presidency of section E of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1957), the presidency of the Institute of British Geographers (1962), and the presidency of the Geographical Association (1964). In 1942 he received the Murchison award from the Royal Geographical Society, while in 1971 he was appointed honorary fellow of King's College, London. He was the first chairman of the newly formed British Geomorphological Research Group (1961), a body that rapidly grew in stature and influence.<br>
<br>Linton's personality was seen as complex by his contemporaries. Though shy and sometimes appearing aloof and distant he was a gifted lecturer and fluent writer. Though capable of charm, fairness, and kindness, he could also appear obdurate, brusque, arrogant, and disinclined to accept opposition to his ideas. He worked long hours and suffered from repeated bouts of insomnia and migraine, yet he was also a devoted family man with four children (three sons and a daughter), having married Vera Cicely (<i>b</i>. 1903/4), daughter of William Tebbs, manager, on 13 August 1929. He was an able artist and gifted musician.<br>
<br>Linton was a geographer with wide interests, though he is most remembered for his work in geomorphology. Under the influence of Sidney Wooldridge, with whom he wrote the classic <span class="italic">Structure, Surface and Drainage in South East England</span> (1939, second edition 1955), he became a leading exponent of denudation chronology&#151;the attempt to reconstruct long-term landform evolution on the basis of the identification of erosional remnants. Although in the 1980s some of the major findings of this work were challenged, it remains as an enduring monument to one of the most distinctive phases of British geomorphology.<br>
<br>Another area where Linton made a major impact was in the study of tors (upstanding rock features, often of granite, characteristic of Devon and Cornwall). He regarded tors as ancient features that were the product of warm climate weathering. He distrusted those who regarded them as relict periglacial features and this involved him in a less than edifying debate with those who opposed his ideas. He also held firm views about the extent of the impact that glaciation had had on the British landscape, and championed the importance of preglacial events and forms. Above all Linton was a fieldworker in the era before process studies and quantification came into vogue.<br>
<br>In addition to his work as a geomorphologist Linton also made some contributions to the study of landscape value assessment, and to the geography of development and energy. In his last years he had developed an interest in the landscapes of the moon, but his premature death stopped these and other new ventures. Suffering from carcinoma of the colon he died on 11 April 1971 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham.<br>
