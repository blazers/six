<span class="headword">Macfarlane <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Brodie]</span>,  Jessie</span>  (1843&#150;1871), <span class="occ">preacher</span>, was born on 20 January 1843 in Edinburgh, the daughter of Archibald McFarlane, a clothier, and his wife, Mary Maxwell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner. Her parents were presbyterians and her early religious experience was influenced by an uncle who, it appears, was a minister. In 1859 she heard Brownlow North (1810&#150;1875), the aristocratic lay preacher, in Edinburgh, and this began an intense period of conviction of sin. Further attendance at revival meetings brought her to an evangelical conversion towards the end of 1860 during the singing of Charlotte Elliott's hymn &#145;Just as I am&#146;. In January 1861, shortly after the death of a younger sister who had implored her to be religiously active, she spontaneously began extemporary preaching at a meeting for women, proving highly effective. She started preaching regularly to other women and throughout 1861 spoke at revivalist missions elsewhere in Scotland, among them one in and around Kelso, where her meetings were arranged by Horatius Bonar (1808&#150;1889), the Free Church of Scotland minister and hymn writer, and while she was there an evangelical awakening took place. During a mission in 1862 at Gullane, East Lothian, so many men crowded around the place she was preaching that she began to admit them to her meetings.<br>
<br>Jessie Macfarlane's active lay ministry was controversial. The man whom she was to marry broke off their engagement because of her public preaching to mixed-gender audiences. She began the religious instruction of new converts in various places, an even more contentious issue than preaching to those deemed unconverted. She was promoted to a larger audience in Glasgow and Edinburgh by Gordon Forlong (1819&#150;1908), an upper-class revivalist who had become convinced of the legitimacy of female preachers on eschatological grounds. In 1864 she published a pamphlet <span class="italic">Scriptural Warrant for Women to Preach the Gospel</span> (1864), in which&#151;repeating the arguments commonly used by contemporary supporters of women preachers&#151;she claimed that the role of prophetess had not been abolished in the church, and that seemingly negative <span class="roman">New Testament</span> strictures on a public role for women were the result of either mistranslation or misinterpretation.<br>
<br>In 1862 Jessie Macfarlane had undergone believer's baptism in an Edinburgh Baptist church, and although she remained non-denominational her views accorded with those of the (Plymouth) Brethren, whose millenarian opinions she shared. She was dependent on free-will offerings for her financial support. Her preaching, often deeply emotional, was enhanced by her &#145;rich full voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Memoriam</span>, 23). One contemporary report noted that her &#145;demeanour is exceedingly ladylike&#146;  (ibid., 47). Her activities were paralleled by women such as Geraldine Hooper (1841&#150;1872), whom she met. The emergence of women preachers was made possible by the revivalist enthusiasm for converts and the egalitarian impulse often implicit within such movements. It has been argued that their activities were important at a popular level in making expanded roles for women possible in the later nineteenth century.<br>
<br>From 1866 onwards Jessie Macfarlane preached in many places in England, including Ipswich, Manchester, and London. On 31 October 1869 she married David Brodie, a physician from Liberton, Edinburgh. Although it had been her intention to continue preaching, she was increasingly troubled by ill health. She died childless on 18 August 1871 at Columbia Lodge, Liberton, survived by her husband. She was buried in Grange cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
