<span class="headword">Sevenoak <span class="st"> [Sevenoke]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1432), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was the son, or foster son, of William Rumschedde of Sevenoaks in Kent. There is no evidence to substantiate the legend that Rumschedde rescued him from abandonment in infancy. It was not unusual for London apprentices to assume the name of their birthplace, and the legend seems to have grown up from Sevenoak's own concern for the poor of his native town. He became a freeman of London in 1394 after an apprenticeship to an ironmonger, but he was readmitted to citizenship as a grocer in 1397, almost certainly under pressure from the Grocers' Company because he was engaged in their trade. He paid the substantial fine of &pound;10 to join the Grocers' livery, and this fact, combined with his remarkably swift commercial rise in a difficult period for trade, must mean that he was well endowed with capital. By 1401 he was advancing credit of &pound;100 to a grocer, and three years later he owned a ship which attacked Prussian ships between England and Zeeland. His foreign trade was diverse and included shipments of cloth, wool, and salt to Flanders and Zeeland and imports of wine in return. In 1409 he transported wheat from Yorkshire to relieve the dearth in London, and he also invested widely in London property, including a quay by the Tower of London. Although he advanced &pound;100 in 1417&#151;one of the highest contributions&#151;towards Henry V's second expedition to France, he generally avoided government finance.<br>
<br>Sevenoak was warden of the Grocers' Company in 1404&#150;5 and gave &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. towards the building of its hall. After serving as a warden of London Bridge in 1404, he was elected alderman in 1411, sheriff in 1412, and a member of the Commons for London in 1417. In that decade of economic distress his responsibility for collecting the taxes of his ward may well explain the outburst of a fellow grocer, Thomas Mayneld, who threatened Sevenoak with hanging if he did not &#145;conduct himself well and honestly&#146;  (Sharpe, <span class="italic">Calendar of Letter-Books</span>, I, 132). When Mayneld was sentenced for his behaviour Sevenoak successfully interceded with the mayor for him, but there was a rigorous side to his character: when he was mayor himself in 1418 he tried to suppress Christmas mummings in London. However his piety and integrity are evident from the permission he obtained to use a portable altar, and from his appointment as a trustee of Whittington's charity. In his own wills were many bequests to churches, chantries, and the poor, and he provided for the foundation of almshouses and a grammar school in Sevenoaks. There is no mention in his wills of a wife or children. He died in or after July 1432 and may have been buried at St Martin Ludgate, London.<br>
