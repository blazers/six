<span class="headword">Hayward <span class="st"> [Heyward]</span>, Sir  Rowland</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1593), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was the eldest son of George Hayward of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Whitbrooke. He was educated at Bridgnorth School, and then apprenticed to a London clothworker, becoming a freeman in the Clothworkers' Company of London in 1541 or 1542 (and its master in 1559). By 1560, when he was elected alderman, he was already a substantial figure in London, and he became one of the city's commercial magnates. He was a merchant adventurer (he had traded at Antwerp before 1553), exporting cloth, importing fustians, camlets, and buckram, and dealing in silk. He was a founder member of the Russia Company and remained active in its affairs, serving as governor eight times between 1567 and 1587. He was a promoter of the third slaving voyage of John Hawkins in 1567 and a governor of the Mineral and Battery Works from 1568 onwards. These varied interests brought him considerable wealth and influence. In 1553 he bought property in four counties, some of it formerly monastic, and by his death he had seventeen manors in five counties, besides London property. He had a large house, Elsinge Spital, in the city, and, from 1583, a country residence, King's Place, Hackney, where he entertained the queen, to whom he also lent money.<br>
<br>Hayward married twice, first Joan Tillesworth (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter of a London goldsmith, and then Catherine, daughter of &#145;customer&#146; Thomas Smith and granddaughter of alderman Sir Andrew Judde. Nine children survived infancy. The two sons&#151;George, who died childless at the age of twenty-eight, and John, who settled in Kent&#151;were both knighted. Of the seven daughters, Elizabeth married Thomas, Baron Knyvet of Escrick, and Joan [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64886/', "Thynne, Joan")</script>] married John Thynne, son of the builder of Longleat.<br>
<br>A major figure in the politics as well as the business of the city of London, Hayward emerges from the records of the corporation as the most active and energetic of Elizabethan aldermen, a man with a finger in every pie and an obsessive devotion to committee work. He was president of St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1572 to his death, comptroller-general of all the hospitals from 1581, and MP for the city from 1572 to 1583, naturally serving on House of Commons committees concerning London, trade, and industry. He was lord mayor in 1570&#150;71, when he was knighted, and again in 1591, when he stepped in on the death of a mayor in mid-term. As father of the city (senior alderman) from 1586, he was involved in matters as various as military preparations in case of Spanish attack, the management of the city's property, and the furtherance of its interests in parliament. He was a mainstay of city government in the crisis caused by plague in 1593, when he was in his seventies, just as he had been thirty years before, in the devastating epidemic of 1563.<br>
<br>Hayward's fortune was dispersed at his death, his personal estate being divided according to the custom of London between his widow, his children, and various legacies. He left money for the poor and the sick, and an endowment of &pound;20 a year for Bridgnorth School. He died on 5 December 1593, and was buried at St Alfege, London Wall.<br>
