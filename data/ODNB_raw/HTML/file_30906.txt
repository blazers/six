<span class="headword">Cary, Sir  (Arthur Lucius) Michael</span>  (1917&#150;1976), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Harrow, Middlesex, on 3 April 1917, the eldest of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32318/', "(Arthur) Joyce Lunel Cary (1888&#150;1957)")</script>, author, and his wife, Gertrude Margaret Ogilvie (1891&#150;1949). His younger brothers included the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99798/', "Tristram Cary")</script>. He went to Eton College as a scholar from 1931 to 1935, and won the king's prize for German. He won a major classical scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford, where he took first classes in classical honour moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1937 and 1939). He was prominent in college life and gained a half-blue at lacrosse. He passed the home civil service examination and joined the Air Ministry in 1939. He spent little more than a year there before joining the Royal Navy in December 1940.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Cary, who had shown an interest in electronics at Eton, served as a radar instructor, then as radar officer on the aircraft-carrier <i>Illustrious</i> before joining the staff of the director of radar equipment in the Admiralty. Early in 1945 he left the navy and returned to the Air Ministry, where he became private secretary to the parliamentary under-secretary of state for air, John Strachey. Finding him deluged with vast numbers of letters about demobilization, Cary asked for a team of bright young people to draft less formal replies and speed up the process. This was an early example of his positive method of work&#151;to size up a problem, find the solution, and persuade colleagues to take action.<br>
<br>Cary soon became private secretary to the secretary of state for air. He was promoted to assistant secretary in 1951. After a spell as head of the air staff secretariat he went to Paris as counsellor in the United Kingdom delegation to NATO. He was admirably suited for the post, not least because of his fluency in French and German. He became a well-known figure in NATO, and in wider circles in Paris.<br>
<br>On his return to the Air Ministry in 1958 Cary became assistant under-secretary of state (personnel). This post primarily concerned RAF personnel, and involved many visits to talk directly with service personnel about their problems. In 1961 he then became deputy secretary of the cabinet, initially under Sir Norman Brook and subsequently under Sir Burke Trend. He was much involved in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when he was acting cabinet secretary because of his chief's illness.<br>
<br>In 1964 Cary became second permanent secretary in the Admiralty in the newly reorganized and unified Ministry of Defence. The next four years were difficult. There was much inter-service bickering over policy and roles. Resources were cut, which led in 1966 to the resignation of his minister, Christopher Mayhew, and the chief of the naval staff. The hard grind of these years required all his skills. He suffered a near-fatal heart attack and went on a recuperative voyage. He fell ill again and was flown off to hospital in Malta.<br>
<br>Cary was the last secretary of the Admiralty (Samuel Pepys had been the third). The first sea lord had seen to it that on Cary's arrival he was immediately measured for his &#145;board rig&#146;, invented by Winston Churchill for civilian board members to wear while on Royal Navy ships. Cary was the last person entitled to wear it. He questioned whether it was appropriate for him to appear on the Admiralty's letters patent as &#145;A.L.M. Cary Esq. C.B., late Lieutenant R.N.V.R.&#146; after a row of senior admirals. He was told that records showed that no other secretary had held commissioned rank in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>Cary next became permanent secretary of the Ministry of Public Building and Works, where from 1968 to 1970 he worked hard at modernizing the ministry, welding professional and administrative staff into single teams as recommended in the 1968 Fulton report, and paying many visits overseas to find out how the ministry managed its stewardship of government buildings. Once he stayed overnight at an RAF airfield in the Persian Gulf manned totally by males unaccompanied by wives. Cary inquired about accommodation for his female private secretary&#151;then a relative rarity&#151;and was told she would be safe in the sick bay under armed guard.<br>
<br>The year 1970 saw the advent of very large Whitehall departments. The Ministry of Public Building and Works was abolished and its functions included in the new Department of the Environment, in which Cary became the secretary, housing and construction. He was caught again by changes in the machinery of government in 1971, when he was sent as secretary to the newly established procurement executive, a free-standing part of the Ministry of Defence. He became its chief executive in 1972. He was permanent under-secretary of state for defence from 1974 until his death.<br>
<br>In all these posts&#151;five in six years&#151;there was a heavy, time-consuming and sometimes acrimonious problem of reorganization, restructuring, reducing, and redeploying of staff. Cary was heavily involved in the Labour government's defence review, which started in December 1974. Its aim was to cut defence expenditure from 5.5 per cent to 4.4 per cent of gross national product by 1985. In policy terms the outcome was to concentrate primarily on NATO and Europe. Service manpower was cut back and substantial equipment savings achieved by re-phasing or delaying deliveries. Cary was chairman, until he died, of yet another committee tasked with reviewing defence organization.<br>
<br>Cary was an extraordinary man by any standards. Possessed of outstanding intellectual ability, he used it not only in his career but over a wide range of other interests. He excelled in making harpsichords and clavichords in the well-equipped workshop in his house at Blackheath, to which he moved in 1947. He had a deep commitment to the highest standards of workmanship. He chose the wood and other materials with the utmost care, made the plans with meticulous concentration, and cut every piece with exactitude. The completed instrument was proudly endorsed with the letters A.L.M.C. He also had a penchant for old Rolls-Royce motor-cars&#151;rather battered&#151;starting in the 1950s with a 1926 model. Into these he crammed his family and careered in style around the streets of Paris when he worked there. He was twice married: In 1942 he married Betty Yingcheng, daughter of Sao-Ke Alfred Sze, a Chinese diplomat, whom he divorced in 1946. In the same year he married Isabel Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1998), daughter of Charles Duff Leslie, mining engineer; they had four sons (one adopted) and a daughter.<br>
<br>Cary had enormous self-confidence. He was immensely good with people. He was relaxed and informal. His habit of talking to everyone on visits frequently upset minutely timed programmes. He was an outstanding conversationalist, enjoying his own talk as well as that of others. He was a complex character. He had much talent and so many interests that he did not always find it easy to decide on which to concentrate. He believed that there was more to life than work. He was a quick worker and a natural delegator, but as a craftsman his attention to detail was total.<br>
<br>Cary enjoyed to the full a wide and active social life. Growing up in the Joyce Cary family meant much to him. His own family life was important to him; family gatherings, rituals, and celebrations mattered. This zest for living a full life, and a range of abilities that few possessed, prevented him attaining the Whitehall heights that in early days had seemed within his reach. This was his choice.<br>
<br>Cary was appointed CB in 1964, KCB in 1965 and GCB in 1976. In 1967 Cary was elected a fellow of Eton; in 1971 he became commodore of the Civil Service Sailing Association; in 1972 president of the Institution of General Technician Engineers; and in 1973 he was elected to an honorary fellowship of Trinity College, Oxford, and to a fellowship of the Royal College of Art. He died suddenly of a coronary thrombosis at his home, Huntswood House, Harpsdon, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on 6 March 1976.<br>
