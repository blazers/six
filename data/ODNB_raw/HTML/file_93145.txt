<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McKechnie, Dame  Sheila Marshall</span>  (1948&#150;2004), <span class="occ">housing reformer and consumer rights campaigner</span>, was born on 3 May 1948 at Dunrowan day hospital, Falkirk, the daughter of Hugh McKechnie, then a commercial traveller, and his wife, Christina Hamilton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall. She was brought up in a council house in Camelon, Falkirk, where her father worked as a baker. Her mother was an avid and wide reader who gave her daughter confidence, but it was her proud and indomitable grandmother whom McKechnie later saw as a particularly influential figure. Even at that time she was determined: her mother observed that she could &#145;start a fight in an empty house&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 5 Jan 2004). Having passed her eleven-plus examination, she went to Falkirk high school and became head girl. She then read politics and history at Edinburgh University, and was the first member of her family to enter higher education. As a senior member of Edinburgh Students' Union she campaigned for student rights and representation. It was probably this formative period that encouraged her to be assertive and direct in her dealings with people in authority. During this period she also became friends with the future Labour chancellor and prime minister Gordon Brown.<br>
<br>Having graduated from Edinburgh in 1970, McKechnie passed the civil service entrance examination and studied for an MA in industrial relations at Warwick University, followed by a year as a researcher at Oxford University (1971&#150;2). Most of her next thirteen years was spent in the trade union movement. In 1972 she became assistant general secretary of the Wallpaper Workers Union and, after a spell as a WEA tutor at Manchester University (1974&#150;6), she took over as health and safety officer at the Association of Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) in 1976. Here, through her work with the union's general secretary Clive Jenkins, she gained an apprenticeship in handling the media to promote an institution or campaign. Through her influence the ASTMS became increasingly sensitive to the health risks faced by some of its members, with McKechnie highlighting the importance of environmental issues in her negotiations. During the 1970s she also played an active role in the women's liberation movement and was involved in the collective responsible for the journal <span class="italic">Red Rag</span>. McKechnie drew attention to the issue of what became known as the &#145;work&#150;life balance&#146;, seeking to reconfigure men's relationships with women, children, and work. Feminism remained an important theme throughout her later career. In the late 1970s she met Alan Frederick Grant, who became her partner for nearly thirty years.<br>
<br>In 1985, after nine years at the ASTMS, McKechnie was appointed director of the housing and homelessness charity Shelter. On arrival she found a demoralized and factional organization struggling to adapt to the changes to public housing policy introduced by Margaret Thatcher's government. McKechnie felt that the charity had become introspective and was failing to engage directly with policy issues. She presided over a revolution at Shelter which saw her move the organization to the political centre ground and considerably increase its external profile and campaigning activity. Under her strong leadership it grew from a staff of fifty, and an annual turnover of &pound;1 million, to 250 staff and a turnover of &pound;10 million.<br>
<br>In policy terms McKechnie challenged the Conservative government's approach to housing head-on. She argued that ministers' emphasis on home ownership meant that sufficient attention was not being paid to the homeless and to some owner-occupiers who, in retirement, could face huge hidden repair bills. While accepting the government's &#145;right to buy&#146; policy, she predicted that a refusal to replace public housing stock, now transferred to the private sector, would lead to social problems. She was also an innovator in developing homelessness services. In the early 1990s she developed the &#145;foyer scheme&#146;, which provided opportunities in training, employment, and personal development and helped to break the &#145;no home&#150;no job&#150;no home&#146; cycle. Her campaigning work with Shelter gave her a public and media profile that was virtually unequalled by other voluntary sector leaders in this period. She became a regular interviewee on national television and radio, including programmes such as <span class="italic">Question Time</span> and <span class="italic">Any Questions</span>, where she repeatedly challenged ministers on their policy towards housing and homelessness. She also applied her feminist perspective to housing issues, highlighting the fact that homelessness affected men and women differently, with more men left as owner-occupiers than women. It was her repeated belief that &#145;People who are homeless are not social inadequates. They are people without homes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 January 2004). Her proudest achievement at Shelter, she maintained, was her success in convincing others that young people living on the street were &#145;more throwaways than runaways&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening News</span>, 10 Jan 2002).<br>
<br>In 1995 McKechnie left Shelter to become director of the Consumers' Association. Her appointment again led to the repositioning and revival of an organization&#151;then known principally as a research body&#151;which she believed failed to offer consumers adequate information on the quality and safety of commercial products and services. Under McKechnie's control the Consumers' Association became an active and highly effective campaigning organization which paid particular attention to the introduction of stronger food regulations, reform of car pricing, and greater accountability in the financial services industry. Her appointment came shortly after a link had been established between non-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. McKechnie thought the government's response inadequate; she campaigned for the creation of an agency for maintaining food standards, and sat on the committee that led to the creation of the Food Standards Agency in 1998. In June 1999 she began a campaign to achieve greater competition in the British car market, which had long operated as a cartel. To publicize the cause she drove a Ford Focus bedecked with a union flag and branded with the slogan &#145;the Great British rip-off&#146; to the headquarters of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The media coverage was intense and several dealerships subsequently reduced their prices. In March 2000 she initiated a &#145;carbusters&#146; scheme, which advised British motorists on how to buy cars at lower prices in continental Europe. In financial services&#151;the third key focus of her leadership, and the one which most exercised her sense of injustice and her reforming spirit&#151;she led a successful campaign to secure compensation for thousands of borrowers after the mis-selling of endowment mortgages. Characteristically she referred to Britain's financial institutions as &#145;the Wild West&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Jan 2004) and argued that sections of the insurance industry were able to treat customers with contempt without fear of sanction. Her aim was to recast completely the environment within which individuals bought financial services, and in 2002 she argued for the creation of a new financial advice network to provide consumers with access to unbiased advice.<br>
<br>In addition to her campaigning roles, McKechnie held a series of senior public positions that reflected her growing influence and authority. In 1998 she was appointed by the chancellor of the exchequer as one of six new non-executive directors to the Bank of England's court. Three years later she was elected president of the European Union Consumer Group. She used both platforms to fight successfully for changes to the competition laws, the labelling of foodstuffs, and regulation of the promotion of pharmaceutical products. In 1995 she had been appointed OBE for services to the homeless and in 2001 was made a DBE for services to consumers. She was in her own words &#145;a fully paid-up member of the awkward squad and will remain so for the rest of my life&#146;, describing both herself and the Consumers' Association as &#145;fiercely, fiercely independent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Jan 2004).<br>
<br>In 1997 Sheila McKechnie was diagnosed with breast cancer but continued to work remarkably hard during a long illness. She died on 2 January 2004 at the North London Hospice, 47 Woodside Avenue, Finchley, London, and was survived by her partner, Alan Grant. Following her death a group of her closest friends and colleagues from her days at Shelter and the Consumers' Association formed the Sheila McKechnie Foundation in her memory. The foundation was established to help equip a new generation of campaigners to make an impact on decision makers.<br>
