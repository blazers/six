<span class="headword">Colquhoun, Sir  Patrick Macchombaich</span>  (1815&#150;1891), <span class="occ">diplomatist and legal writer</span>, was born on 13 April 1815, the eldest son of James Colquhoun (1780&#150;1855) and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5992/', "Patrick Colquhoun")</script>. His father was charg&eacute; d'affaires of the king of Saxony, the duke of Oldenburg, and of the Hanseatic republics, L&uuml;beck, Bremen, and Hamburg; he was also political agent for many of the West Indian islands, a knight of the Ottoman empire, and commander of the Saxon order of merit. Patrick entered Westminster School on 25 May 1826, left in August 1832, and was admitted pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 27 February 1833. He graduated BA in 1837, MA in 1844, and LLD in 1851; he was also LLD of Heidelberg (1838). On 1 May 1834 he was admitted student of the Inner Temple, and on 4 May 1838 he was called to the bar; he became QC in 1868, bencher of his inn in 1869, and treasurer in 1888. In 1843 he married Katherine, daughter of M. de St Vitalis. They had at least one child, Eliza, who married the orientalist James William Redhouse in 1888.<br>
<br>Through his father's connection with the Hanse towns, Colquhoun was in 1840 appointed their plenipotentiary to conclude commercial treaties with Turkey, Persia, and Greece. These duties occupied him for four years, and on his return to England in 1844 he joined the home circuit. In 1845 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, during Hallam's presidency; he was placed on the council in 1846, was made librarian in 1852, vice-president in 1869, and president in succession to the duke of Albany in 1886. During his residence in England he wrote a substantial work in four large volumes on Roman civil law (1849&#150;54). In 1857 he was appointed aulic councillor to the king of Saxony, and he was standing counsel to the Saxon legation until it was abolished by the war of 1866.<br>
<br>In 1858 Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, then colonial secretary, appointed Colquhoun a member of the supreme court of justice in the Ionian Islands, and in 1861 he became chief justice of the court, and was knighted. In the following year the high commissioner, Sir Henry Knight Storks, dismissed two Ionian judges. Colquhoun took their part, and in 1864, after the cession of the islands to Greece, he published a bitter attack on Storks. Storks's action was, however, upheld by the Colonial Office.<br>
<br>Between 1875 and 1878 Colquhoun published two works on legal subjects and one on foreign affairs, provoked by events in Bulgaria. In 1886 he was elected honorary fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. He died at his chambers in King's Bench Walk, 41 the Temple, on 18 May 1891; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Colquhoun was a man of remarkable linguistic attainments; he spoke most of the tongues and many of the dialects of Europe, was a thorough classical scholar and a jurist. He received orders of merit from the sultan of Turkey, the kings of Greece and of Saxony, and the duke of Oldenburg. He was also, like his brother, James du Colquhoun (<i>d</i>. 1891), who founded the Cercle Nautique at Cannes, a noted oarsman. In 1837 (one source says 1835) he won the Wingfield sculls, which made him amateur champion of England, and in the same year he founded the Colquhoun sculls for the benefit of the Lady Margaret Boat Club; in 1842 the prize was thrown open to the university. In 1837 he also rowed at Henley in a race between St John's College, Cambridge, and Queen's College, Oxford, the head boats of the respective universities, and for many years he was secretary of the Leander Boat Club.<br>
