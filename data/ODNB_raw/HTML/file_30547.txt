</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  Herbert</span>  (1862&#150;1946), <span class="occ">architect and author</span>, was born on 9 June 1862 at Owletts, Cobham, Kent, the fourth of the eleven children of Thomas Henry Baker (1824&#150;1904), gentleman farmer and JP, and his wife, Frances Georgina (<i>d</i>. 1916), daughter of William Davis of Rochester. After a rural childhood at Owletts and a public school education, Baker trained as an architect in London before embarking on one of the great imperial careers in British architecture. He designed major government buildings in South Africa, India, Rhodesia, and Kenya, as well as imperial works in London and Oxford. Baker was also an accomplished domestic architect, the designer of several war memorials, and the rebuilder of the Bank of England. A literary man, Baker produced grand-manner classicism at the core and on the periphery of the British empire during the sunset decades of that architectural tradition and political era.<h2>
<a name="Educationandarchitecturaltraining"></a>Education and architectural training</h2>Baker briefly attended Haileybury College, then in 1873 entered Tonbridge School, where he excelled in mathematics and captained both the cricket and football teams. At this point he decided upon a career in architecture, largely because his parents thought him skilled in drawing. A cousin in London, Arthur Baker (1841&#150;1896), was an architect and young Herbert went to him about 1880 for his first professional training. After a three-year pupillage Baker joined the more established firm of Ernest George and Peto, where he rose to become the partners' leading assistant. Baker also pursued studies at the Royal Academy School of Design and took sketching trips across Britain and northern Europe, often in the company of his younger office-mate Edwin Lutyens. He won the Royal Institute of British Architects' Ashpitel prize (1889) for the highest score in the associate examination before opening his own office in Gravesend in 1891. One year later he set out to seek his fortune in South Africa.<h2>
<a name="CareerinSouthAfrica"></a>Career in South Africa</h2>Baker travelled to the Cape Colony in 1892, ostensibly to assist in the nascent fruit farm operation of his brother Lionel. A chance meeting with Cecil Rhodes led to the commission for the prime minister's Cape Town residence, Groote Schuur (completed in 1896). Baker developed his so-called Cape Dutch style from careful study of early Dutch and Huguenot homesteads, favouring simple massings of whitewashed walls and random-laid stone, generous verandas, broad tiled roofs, high gables and chimneys, and wood-beam interior ceilings. Altogether, Baker designed some 300 South African houses, including The Woolsack (Cape Town, 1900) for Rudyard Kipling and the Big House (1902&#150;5) for the duke of Westminster. Before the South African War (1899&#150;1902) Baker worked in the British Cape Colony. Afterwards, he was invited by the British high commissioner, Alfred, Lord Milner, to help reconstruct and integrate into the British system the defeated Transvaal and Orange Free State. Shifting his post-war practice northward, the architect moved to Johannesburg in 1902, building his home, Stonehouse, which he shared for a while with several of Milner's young, Oxford-educated colonial administrators.<br>
<br>During the South African War, Baker's patron Rhodes had sent the architect on a Mediterranean study trip in 1899&#150;1900. When the empire-builder died two years later, Baker designed a stoa-like memorial, composed of a U-shaped, open Doric colonnade, on the side of Table Mountain above Groote Schuur (1905&#150;8). When South Africa's four colonies formally united in 1910, Baker's political connections with the general and politician Jan Smuts secured him the commission for the main government office complex in Pretoria. Drawing inspiration from Greek hillside sanctuaries, Baker's Union Buildings (1910&#150;13) sprawl across their own acropolis-like site on the slope of Meintjes Kop, with two massive office blocks linked by a semicircular colonnade embracing an outdoor amphitheatre designed for large public gatherings. A pair of tall towers symbolized the &#145;two races of South Africa&#146; (British and Dutch). From elevated corner offices ministers could look out from columnar loggias to &#145;gather inspiration and visions of greatness&#146;  (Baker, 60).<br>
<br>Altogether Baker spent some twenty years in South Africa, having been given, as he said, &#145;the opportunity for an architecture which establishes a nation&#146;  (Baker, 48). Besides mansions and official complexes, he built cathedrals in Pretoria and Johannesburg, Pretoria's rail station, a Johannesburg medical institute, commercial offices, colleges, and also mineworkers' villages on the Witwatersrand. Baker's partners in South Africa were Ernest Willmott Sloper (1871&#150;1916), Francis Fleming (1875&#150;1950), Franklin Kendall (1870&#150;1948), and Francis Masey (1861&#150;1912).<h2>
<a name="CareerinIndia"></a>Career in India</h2>In 1904 the architect returned briefly to England, where he renewed a boyhood acquaintance with a distant cousin, Florence Edmeades (1878&#150;1965) of Nurstead Court, Kent, daughter of Major-General Henry Edmeades and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Collings. They married on 21 June 1904, when Baker was aged forty-two, and together had four children: Ann, Henry, Allaire, and Alfred.<br>
<br>Despite great success in South Africa during the prime of his life, Baker recognized the limits of a career located on one imperial fringe. In 1912 he welcomed the opportunity to collaborate with his old friend Lutyens in the designing of a vast new government complex at New Delhi. The fifty-year-old Baker left South Africa, moved his family and practice back home to England, and travelled out to India as needed over the next decade and a half.<br>
<br>In India, Baker successfully argued for the positioning of Lutyens's Viceroy House and his secretariat buildings at the same level on either side of the crest of Raisina Hill. This created an acropolis-like platform and symbolized to Baker the equality of the colonial bureaucracy and executive. Baker's pair of quarter-mile-long, matching secretariat buildings (1912&#150;27) flanked the ceremonial King's Way up to the viceroy's house. The secretariat buildings themselves were composed of thick, dark-stone basements surmounted by lighter-coloured office storeys, projecting loggias as at Pretoria, plus skyline towers, turrets, and high central domes. The overall massing bore reminiscences of Greenwich Hospital (begun in 1696).<br>
<br>Off the King's Way to the north-east, Baker also constructed a new legislative building (1917&#150;29). This was a circular structure at Lutyens's insistence, three storeys high and 570 feet in diameter. Behind its sweeping colonnade lay a central domed hall symbolizing a united India, plus three semicircular halls for the council of state, the legislative assembly, and the chamber of princes, the last of which Baker emblazoned with specially invented heraldic escutcheons.<br>
<br>Baker's purpose was to &#145;graft&#146; the &#145;ordered beauty&#146; of a Wren-inspired English classical composition&#151;which the architect thought symbolized &#145;good government&#146; and the &#145;idea of law and order&#146;&#151;with selected features of an otherwise unruly Indian architecture: for example, wide overhanging <i>chajjas</i> to block the rain and sun, pierced window screen <i>jaalis</i> for shade and ventilation, and open columnar <i>chattris</i> for skyline interest and guard shelters  (Baker, 63 and 219&#150;21). Along with their warm wall colours, generous interior courtyards, and small recessed windows, Baker's hybrid buildings functionally adapted European classicism to a tropical climate. At the same time they deliberately symbolized the larger imperial project, in which Indians could politically elevate themselves only by grafting their own culture onto British constitutional structures.<h2>
<a name="PracticeinBritain"></a>Practice in Britain</h2>Back in his home near Westminster Abbey (first at 14 Barton Street and then 2 Smith Square), Baker in the 1920s and 1930s established with his partner Alexander T. Scott (1887&#150;1962) a flourishing practice in his native country. He designed a series of church renovations, City banks, and a Thames bridge at Mortlake, as well as the imperial India House (1928&#150;30), South Africa House (1930&#150;35), Royal Empire Society (1938), and London House, a Commonwealth students' hostel for the University of London (1936&#150;8). Here Baker transposed his grand-manner classical style evolved on the imperial periphery back to the metropolitan core: broad wall surfaces, pitched tile roofs, discrete ornamental flourishes, and large, loose-jointed geometrical massings.<br>
<br>Baker also possessed a more informal public manner which confirmed his early loyalties to the arts and crafts movement. This was evidenced in the brick, stone, and flint Church House (1935&#150;40; bombed and rebuilt), built as the administrative headquarters for the Church of England, and emblazoned with carefully researched saints' arms and emblems. At Rhodes House in Oxford (1929), for his late patron's scholarship students, Baker's rough stone exteriors, tile roofs, and interior oak ceilings and whitewashed walls synthesized classical grandeur with Cotswold vernacularism in an attempt to be, as Baker explained, &#145;as styleless and elementary as possible&#146;  (Baker, 136).<br>
<br>Baker served, too, as one of the architects for the Imperial War Graves Commission from 1917 to 1928. Advocating the symbolism of the cross and the atmosphere of the English churchyard, and utilizing a sombre classical palette, he supervised the construction of over 100 cemeteries in France and himself designed the memorial cemeteries for the South African missing at Delville Wood and for the Indian missing at Neuve Chapelle. At home he produced several schools' war memorials, including what is often considered his greatest masterpiece, the war memorial cloister at Winchester College (1922&#150;4), a simple four-square block beneath a solid pitched roof, &#145;a work after my own heart&#146;, wrote Baker, &#145;building in a manner which I loved in the architecture of my native country, flint and stone, oak roof-trees, all made living in expression with symbols, heraldry, and sculpture&#146;  (Baker, 97).<h2>
<a name="TheBankofEngland"></a>The Bank of England</h2>Baker's last great public commission occurred in the heart of the City of London. Here Baker rebuilt the Bank of England (1921&#150;42), razing the entire pre-existing 3 acre complex, except for the early nineteenth-century perimeter walls erected by John Soane. In stages Baker erected a steel-framed, stone-clad office building, seven storeys at its highest, with a ring of vaulted, top-lit, Soanean bank halls along the lower perimeter base. Always attentive to symbolism, Baker tried to embody the Bank of England's &#145;tradition of the private house&#146; and &#145;that invisible thing, Trust&#146;  (Baker, 123&#150;4). He created a domiciliary executive core and lavishly embellished the building with allegorical sculptures, marble mosaics of historic coins, Greek inscriptions, and wall paintings depicting contemporary bank staff at work. At the bank Baker employed a whole host of artistic collaborators, notably the sculptor Charles Wheeler and the artist D. Y. Cameron. Today Baker's mixed reputation rests largely on the perceived failures of this his most prominent English building. The Bank of England's stacked superstructure rests uncomfortably on the low base, and critics continue to resent the loss of the earlier building, conveniently ignoring Soane's wilful destruction of his own predecessors' work as well as the existential perils faced by any capitalist architecture.<h2>
<a name="Privatelifefriendsidealsinterests"></a>Private life: friends, ideals, interests</h2>In his personal as well as professional life, Baker lived amid Britain's leading imperial protagonists. He numbered among his friends and acquaintances Rhodes, Kipling, Smuts, Milner, T. E. Lawrence&#151;who wrote <span class="italic">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</span> (1926&#150;35) while living upstairs from Baker in Barton Street&#151;and of course that other great imperial architect Lutyens, with whom Baker's fortune and fame has been inextricably linked.<br>
<br>After their early London friendship, Lutyens had visited Baker in South Africa, and in 1908 the two briefly discussed joining formally as partners. In India after 1912, antagonisms arose over aesthetic and administrative matters, which were only much later soothed, when in the 1920s and 1930s the two became rival bank headquarters builders in the City of London. Historians have judged Baker the lesser of the two architecturally and Baker frankly credited his friend's superior handling of &#145;abstract and geometrical qualities&#146; and the &#145;Shakespearean quality&#146; of Lutyens's architecture, &#145;with its wit, fun, vitality, and rare beauty&#146;  (Baker, 67 and 208). Baker, on the other hand, concentrated on legible symbols, messages, sentiments, and significations. &#145;Content in art, national and human sentiment, and their expression in architecture, seem to me to be of the greatest importance&#146;  (Baker, 68). Towards this end, Baker's public buildings were usually composed with symbolic meaning and festooned with appropriate heraldry, sculpture, painting, and inscriptions. Modernist eyes have favoured Lutyens's inventive handling of classicism's broad masses and surfaces, above the more literary approach of Baker, the less naturally assured artist.<br>
<br>On a personal level, Baker's friends knew him as a British patriot and pious Anglican, reserved, idealistic, and with an underlying gentleness. &#145;I like the look of that young man&#146;, Rhodes reportedly remarked after their first meeting, &#145;he doesn't talk too much&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 Feb 1946, 7e). Outside architecture, literature was Baker's chief intellectual interest. He translated French verse, was a member of the Literary Society Dining Club, and besides the biography <span class="italic">Cecil Rhodes by his Architect</span> (1934) also wrote texts explaining several of his buildings' decorative programmes, including <span class="italic">The Church House: its Art and Symbolism</span> (1940). Baker's own autobiography, <span class="italic">Architecture and Personalities</span> (1944), is chock full of quotations and allusions and is perhaps the most literary memoir ever penned by an architect.<br>
<br>In physical appearance, the well-built architect possessed a high, broad forehead and strong, prominent features, with eyes sloping down seriously at the ends. From Baker's schooldays athletics was a passion, and he continued playing cricket in South Africa. While in India he rode regularly in the mornings and was known to run the 3 miles back and forth between his home and office. When Baker returned to live in England he was active in Kent county cricket, designed a new grandstand at Lord's, and hosted rustic cricket parties for his colleagues at the family home, Owletts.<h2>
<a name="Owletts"></a>Owletts</h2>Throughout Baker's life Owletts and the Kent countryside remained touchstones of his personality and inspired his love of local materials and fine craftsmanship. The four-square, red-brick Owletts, with its high tiled roof and massive pair of chimneys, had been built in 1683 and came into Baker's family in 1796. Baker spent his boyhood there and lived at Owletts as much as in London when he returned from South Africa. In his memoir Baker described &#145;the life of the country&#146; as &#145;the deeper part &hellip; of my being&#146;, and himself as &#145;one born and bred in an English home and amongst English fields&#146;  (Baker, 210 and 215). He enjoyed working in the Owletts garden, with its bird-bath made of salvaged Bank of England Corinthian capitals, and he donated the house to the National Trust in 1937. At the beginning of the war, physically disabled from a stroke suffered some years earlier, Baker retired to Owletts, where he died after a short illness on 4 February 1946. His wife survived him. An old cherry tree from the orchard provided wood for a casket, handmade by Baker's three sons to hold their father's ashes, which was interred in Westminster Abbey on 12 February 1946.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>The end of Baker's life marked also nearly the end of Britain's overseas empire and the grand-manner classical style with which his career was so strongly connected. After going out to South Africa to seek his fortune, Baker became that emerging nation's most significant architect, before returning in middle age to the heart of empire to fashion, in Lutyens's shadow, great public buildings for New Delhi and the metropolis itself.<br>
<br>For his efforts and talents Baker was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1900) and a member of the Royal Academy (1932). He was knighted in 1926 and created KCIE in 1930. He was awarded the royal gold medal for architecture (1927) and honorary doctorates at the universities of Witwatersrand (LLD, 1934) and Oxford (DCL, 1937). Baker himself in 1912 endowed a travelling scholarship for young South African architects to the British School at Rome, and out of a bequest of &pound;60,221 left &pound;5000 to the Royal Academy of Art for advanced students from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Commonwealth. An architectural firm bearing Baker's name continued to operate until the early 1970s.<br>
