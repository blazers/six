<span class="headword">Diceto,  Ralph  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1199/1200), <span class="occ">chronicler and ecclesiastic</span>, is of unknown origins. His surname has given rise to much discussion; William Stubbs pronounced it &#145;an artificial name, adopted by its bearer as the Latin name of a place with which he was associated, but which had no proper Latin name of its own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Opera historica</span>, ed. Stubbs, 1.xvii), and was inclined to connect it with one of three places named Dissai or Diss&eacute; in Maine. However, recent scholarship has noted Ralph as occurring in charters under such name forms as Dysci and Dici, which can very plausibly be construed as deriving from Diss. Certainty on the point is not presently to be had, but it is undoubtedly possible that he was a Norfolk man. It would appear that he was born in the 1120s, for his notices of events concerning St Paul's begin in 1136, and &#145;certainly have the appearance of personal recollections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Opera historica</span>, ed. Stubbs, 1.xx). These recollections imply Ralph's presence there from boyhood, and his nomination as archdeacon of Middlesex by Bishop Richard de Belmeis of London (<i>d</i>. 1162), as the latter's first episcopal act after his consecration on 28 September 1152, and the bishop's tenacity in adhering to his choice in the face of competition, alike suggest that Ralph himself belonged to the Belmeis family, which prospered in the diocese under its two Bishop Richards. Diceto's most likely place in the pedigree is as son or nephew of Ralph of Langford (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1154?), brother of Bishop Richard de Belmeis, and dean of St Paul's in 1152.<br>
<br>When he was appointed archdeacon in 1152, Diceto was styled &#145;master&#146;. Twice a student at the Paris schools, Diceto appears to have gone there for the first time in the 1140s. He was back in England in the early 1150s, and was probably present at Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154, but then seems to have returned to Paris, perhaps to study law. Thereafter evidence for his career is provided both by his own writings and by independent record evidence. By 1164 he had acquired the livings of Aynho, Northamptonshire, and Finchingfield, Essex, and served them both by vicars. In that year he attended the Council of Northampton, and in 1166 was sent as a messenger by the English bishops to Archbishop Thomas Becket, who was then in exile. In the aftermath of Becket's murder, about the end of 1171, he was one of a delegation to the pope, sent to petition for the lifting of the suspension of Gilbert Foliot as bishop of London. He was active as an archdeacon, for instance trying to maintain his own jurisdiction over St Margaret's, Westminster. In 1180 he was elected dean of St Paul's, and early in the following year conducted a detailed survey of the chapter's property. He also enacted a statute of residence for the cathedral, in which he tried to strike a realistic balance between the needs of St Paul's for residentiary clergy, and the ever-increasing tendency for the canons to be pluralists and absentees. In December 1187 he acted alongside Hubert Walter as a papal judge-delegate, while on 3 September 1189 he acted in place of the bishop of London (the see being vacant) at the coronation of Richard I. The latter's visit to St Paul's in 1194, along with the archbishop of Rouen, was but one of the visits by secular and ecclesiastical rulers in the 1180s and 1190s that Diceto recorded, and presumably attended.<br>
<br>Diceto refers to himself for the last time on 23 May 1199, when he presented William de Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise to Archbishop Walter for consecration. The date of his death, like the place of his birth, is problematic. Although his chronicle continues to 1202, and his obit was commemorated at St Paul's on 22 November, it has been persuasively argued that Diceto died on that day not in 1202 but in either 1199 or 1200, and that the section dealing with events after the coronation of King John, on 27 May 1199, is the work of a continuator. Diceto was fittingly remembered at St Paul's as &#145;the good dean&#146;  (<span class="italic">Opera historica</span>, ed. Stubbs, 1.lxxxv). He codified the cathedral's customs and statutes, and built a deanery house and chapel within its cathedral precincts, which he bequeathed to his successors, along with relics (which included the staff of St Martin of Tours and the head of St Eugenius), vestments, ornaments, and books.<br>
<br>In this last bequest there was a volume of chronicles. Diceto was the author of two major historical narratives, and also of a collection of shorter pieces, his <i>opuscula</i>. Though mainly little more than lists&#151;bishops of various English dioceses, popes, archbishops of Canterbury, emperors, kings, and the like&#151;the latter are nevertheless characteristic of an important side of Diceto's intellectual personality, as both historian and ecclesiastic. For he was a methodical and exact compiler of information of all kinds, and had probably been assembling material for years before he began to compose his chronicles. This can also be seen in his survey of the St Paul's manors, with its list of headings under which the inquest was to be made, the precise timetable under which it was carried out, and the remarkably detailed notice of its date, placing it in time by reference to no less than six different chronological systems, ranging from the year <i>anno Domini</i> to Diceto's own deanship.<br>
<br>But in spite of his concern for the minutiae of history, Diceto was a man of wide vision. His epitome of chronicles, the <span class="italic">Abbreviationes chronicorum</span>, covers the history of the world from the creation to 1147 in a series of brief annals, and represents the most ambitious attempt at a world history made until then by an Englishman. That it contains some original material towards the end, mostly concerning St Paul's, is arguably less significant than the work's terms of reference. In an extended prologue (in which the influence of Hugh of St Victor is apparent), Diceto explains that the <span class="italic">Abbreviationes</span> are divided into three sections, defined as the very ancient (that is, before Christ), the ancient (the Christian era), and the modern&#151;his own time. He follows this with a list of the important writers on whose work he has drawn, along with notes of the periods covered in their writings, in the process providing evidence for the impressive range of his reading (he was also well read in the classics, elsewhere quoting such authors as Claudian, Lucan, and Sidonius Apollinaris, and making a disparaging reference to the French by way of a neatly adapted line from Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>). And he also makes an important technical innovation (later imitated by Matthew Paris), in the use of a number of marginal <i>signa</i>, pictorial devices employed to indicate the presence in the adjacent text of particular subjects, such as councils, royal unction, disputes between king and church.<br>
<br>These signs (along with two new ones, including one for dissension between the king and his sons, represented by two hands grasping a crown from either side) are also used in Diceto's more important historical work, the <span class="italic">Ymagines historiarum</span>. Starting with the knighting of the future Henry II in 1149, it likewise draws on a wide range of materials, although until 1171, perhaps until 1183, Robert de Torigni is the principal source used. But before, as well as after, 1171 Diceto makes considerable use of documents, as for instance in his account of the Becket dispute, which is largely made up of letters and papal bulls. And he also exploited his personal contacts. Men of the importance of Hubert Walter, William de Longchamp, Walter de Coutances, archbishop of Rouen and justiciar, several of whose letters are quoted verbatim, Richard fitz Nigel, and Richard of Ilchester, who is recorded as asking Diceto for advice in 1166, could provide letters and news. With such sources of information, it is not surprising that Diceto was well informed, not least about events abroad, especially in France, where he often reports on events in Henry II's continental lands. He also followed events in the kingdom of Jerusalem, and sometimes in Constantinople. He made systematic use of Richard I's newsletters.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Ymagines historiarum</span> are not just a valuable source for events in the last half of the twelfth century. Diceto was an intellectual historian, seriously interested in problems arising from the deployment of power, which he saw from the perspective of an ecclesiastic who appreciated the benefits of strong and relatively impartial royal government, and could grasp the concept of public authority. He admired Henry II's concern for good order, and his chronicle is an important source for such acts of government as the peacekeeping measures of 1179; he also condemned acts of rebellion and disorder, like the massacres of Jews in 1190. The dean of St Paul's saw nothing incongruous in bishops' being involved in secular government, arguing rather that they made better officials than did laymen. The Becket dispute inevitably put a severe strain on his loyalties, divided as they were not only between the king and the primate, but also, and perhaps more stressfully, between Becket and Diceto's own bishop, Gilbert Foliot, who remained a determined opponent of the archbishop for as long as the latter lived. To some extent, both in the <span class="italic">Ymagines</span> and in his abbreviated account of the quarrel, known as the <span class="italic">Series causae</span>, Diceto used his marginal <i>signa</i> simply to draw attention to the issues at stake; but they also acted as a sort of silent commentary on events, and one that had the positive advantage of enabling him to avoid taking up too clear-cut a position on the rights and wrongs of a painful controversy. If in the end Diceto favours Becket, his remarkably even-handed account nevertheless shows that he appreciated the strength of Henry II's position on the issue of criminous clerks.<br>
<br>Diceto's judgement was not always faultless; he was taken in by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and in his account of the events of 1189 shows that he regarded the death of Henry II as fulfilling the prophecies of Merlin. But as a historian he deserves the admiration with which he has been regarded, and the use that has been made of his writings, from the thirteenth century onwards. His chronicles were first printed in 1652, in the <span class="italic">Historiae Anglicanae scriptores X</span> of Roger Twysden and John Selden, an excellent edition marred only by its failure to reproduce Diceto's <i>signa</i>. This deficiency was remedied in Stubbs's edition of 1876, which has remained the basis for the study of Diceto's work.<br>
