<span class="headword">Smith,  Elizabeth</span>  (1776&#150;1806), <span class="occ">scholar and translator</span>, was born on 27 December 1776 at Burn Hall, near Durham, the second child and eldest daughter in the family of four sons and three daughters of George Smith, banker, and his wife, Julia, daughter and sole heir of Richard Mott of Carlton, Suffolk. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25785/', "Sir Charles Felix Smith")</script> was her brother. Her extensive learning was acquired in spite of many disruptions in her life. In June 1785 the family moved to Piercefield Park, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire; when her father's business collapsed after the declaration of war by France (1 February 1793) the family and its valuable library were broken up. In 1794 her father took a commission in the army, serving for some years in Ireland. For a few months in 1796 she and her mother joined her father in Sligo; here she studied the Irish language. In summer 1799 they moved to Ballitor, co. Kildare, where she had access to a good library. Until they moved to Coniston in 1801 she did not have a settled home, spending much of her time visiting friends in London, Shirley, and Bath.<br>
<br>Aside from a governess who taught her French and a little Italian, from six to eight years of age and again from ten to twelve, Smith was largely self-taught. In 1789 she became governess to her siblings and began an influential friendship with Henrietta Maria Bowdler. In 1794 she began learning Arabic and Persian from her brother's oriental dictionary; in 1796 she studied Hebrew from a <span class="roman">Bible</span> belonging to Henrietta Bowdler's mother. Between 1795 and 1799 she learned Spanish, German, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, some Syriac, and Erse, as well as music, mathematics, and astronomy.<br>
<br>Henrietta Bowdler visited Coniston in 1802, introducing Smith to Elizabeth Hamilton, who much admired her. In 1803 Elizabeth Smith completed her translation of <span class="roman">Job</span>, and was encouraged to translate F. G. Klopstock's memoirs for publication. She dreaded being called a learned lady: her mother said that &#145;she was a living library; but locked up, except to a chosen few&#146;. Hannah More, in <span class="italic">Coelebs in Search of a Wife</span> (1804), praised her acquirements, which were &#145;beautifully shaded, by the gentle exercise of every domestic virtue&#146;. In 1805 Elizabeth Smith caught a cold, from which she never fully recovered. She died, unmarried, on 7 August 1806 in Coniston.<br>
<br>After Smith's death Bowdler published <span class="italic">Fragments in Prose and Verse</span> (1808), a selection of Smith's works interspersed with an account of her life; it ran into many editions. The poems, some in imitation of Ossian, are graceful if unremarkable and her reflections conventional but lively. It is in her flowing translations and philological work that she shines. Also published from her papers were: <span class="italic">Memoirs of Frederick and Margaret Klopstock</span> (1808); her translation of <span class="roman">Job</span> (1810), edited by Francis Randolph; and <span class="italic">A Vocabulary, Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian</span>, edited by John Frederick Usko, vicar of Orsett, Essex, who supplied &#145;A praxis on the Arabic alphabet&#146; (1814). Usko thought this the first systematic collation of these languages. Selections from her didactic writings appeared in <span class="italic">The Lady's Monitor</span> (1828).<br>
