<span class="headword">Sutton,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1665), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, whose parentage is unknown and whose birth date depends upon the assumption that he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen, was bound to Thomas Browne, mathematical instrument maker, in the Joiners' Company on 18 August 1638. He was made free of the company in August 1648 and became a liveryman in 1657. He booked five apprentices in the company, one of whom, John Marke (free 1664), succeeded him.<br>
<br>Sutton, who lived and worked in Threadneedle Street behind the Royal Exchange, London, was quickly integrated into the circle of superior craftsmen, mathematical practitioners, and savants of mid-century London, which included men such as John Collins, Thomas Harvey, Samuel Morland, and Euclid Speidell. In the <span class="italic">Sector on a Quadrant</span> (1658), a work written by John Collins at Sutton's request, and of which the latter was joint publisher, Henry Sutton shares an advertisement for &#145;All manner of Mathematical Instruments, either for Sea or Land &hellip; in Wood or Brass&#146; with William Sutton (free of the Joiners' Company 2 February 1656); as William's father was also a Henry, it is likely that they were related, as both may also have been to the instrument maker Baptist Sutton (<i>fl</i>. 1636&#150;1653).<br>
<br>Sutton was a prolific maker, more than thirty of whose instruments are known to have survived, and he also exploited the possibilities of printing and publishing to advance his career. Many of his instruments were cheap, popular sundials printed on paper from copper plates which he had engraved, and he was noted for the accuracy of his scale division. On 6 December 1653 he was paid &pound;20 2<i>s</i>. for instruments supplied for &#145;the service of the publique in Ireland&#146;, and in 1654 he provided the graph paper for Petty's &#145;down survey&#146;. Sutton's first wife, Susan, was buried on 20 October 1658. He quickly married again on 22 February 1659, but his new wife, Jane, soon followed her predecessor to the grave. She was interred on 26 November 1659.<br>
<br>Instruments signed and dated by Sutton cover the whole of his active career from 1648 to 1664, and those known to have been made for clients such as Samuel Morland and William Rook attest to his contacts with the learned world. Sutton also maintained creative collaboration with other craftsmen, in particular with John Browne, son of Thomas Browne, Sutton's master, for whom he was joint publisher of two books, and with the clockmaker Samuel Knibb, cousin of the clockmakers Joseph and John Knibb. Sutton collaborated with Samuel Knibb in the making of Samuel Morland's trigonometrical machine of 1664, and John Knibb was apprenticed to William Sutton in the same year. Henry Sutton's connection with Morland can be shown to go back to the 1650s: some of the earliest examples of a perpetual calendar invented by Morland are to be found on quadrants by Sutton dated 1658. On 8 August 1663 Sutton, who, as John Collins had noted, was not without knowledge of the mathematical sciences, observed a lunar eclipse in company with Thomas Streete and Robert Anderson.<br>
<br>Sutton died of the plague and was buried at St Christopher-le-Stocks, London, on 21 September 1665, soon to be followed by his two surviving children. His early death robbed the scientific community of London of a highly talented craftsman who was clearly only just beginning to realize his full potential. In 1669, R. Morden reissued a single sheet <span class="italic">Description and Use of a Large Quadrant</span> by Sutton, and in the next century his quadrants could still be described by Edmund Stone as &#145;the finest divided instruments in the World, and the Regularity and Exactness of the vast Number of Circles drawn upon them is highly delightful to behold&#146;  (Bion, suppl.).<br>
