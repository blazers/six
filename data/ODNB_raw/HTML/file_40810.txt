<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thompson,  William</span>  (1793&#150;1854), <span class="occ">ironmaster and financier</span>, was born at Grayrigg Head, near Kendal, Westmorland, the second son of James Thompson. He was educated at Charterhouse before joining the business of his uncle William Thompson, who had been a partner with Richard Crawshay (1744&#150;1799) in the leading firm of iron merchants in the City of London. After Crawshay's death Thompson's uncle formed a new merchant house with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49103/', "Samuel Homfray (1762&#150;1822)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47499/', "Homfray family (per. 1702&#150;1833)")</script>] and William Henry Forman (<i>d</i>. 1869) of the Penydarren ironworks at Merthyr Tudful in Wales.<br>
<br>The elder William Thompson, like the Crawshay family, had major interests in south Wales iron furnaces. In 1799 he leased the Tintern ironworks, and in 1806 he purchased three-tenth shares of the Redbrook and Lydbrook ironworks. Most important was his involvement with Homfray, one of the leading south Wales ironmasters at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. In 1800 Homfray leased coal and iron ore from the Tredegar estate and formed a partnership with Thompson and others to establish the Tredegar ironworks with a capital of &pound;30,000. Homfray was also involved in establishing the Aberd&acirc;r works in 1801 and was a partner in the Penydarren company at Merthyr Tudful where Thompson acquired an interest. The younger William inherited his uncle's fortune, and in 1817 he married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1861), the second daughter of Homfray and niece of Sir Charles Morgan of Tredegar. By the early 1820s he was the sole owner of Penydarren; he seems to have left day-to-day operations to managers at Merthyr Tudful, and he concentrated on more general issues such as leases and, possibly, marketing.<br>
<br>Lady Charlotte Guest, the wife of Sir Josiah John Guest of the Dowlais works, commented in 1836 that Thompson &#145;is the <i>Alderman</i> in every sense, and has not the uprightness which I should have been inclined to give most City merchants credit for&#146;  (<span class="italic">Guest: Extracts</span>, 41). Her comment probably reflects the simmering boundary dispute between the two works, but in 1846 Sir Josiah Guest and Thompson were willing to submerge their differences in hostility to a greater foe, namely, John Crichton-Stuart, the second marquess of Bute, who was demanding more realistic terms for the renewal of leases. They proposed to form a single joint-stock company in order to negotiate with Bute, but this was declared inadmissible under the lease. In 1848 the Bute estate attempted to make terms with Thompson to take over the Dowlais works. By this stage the south Wales works were past their peak, and Penydarren was in decline. On his death in 1854, Thompson's interests in the south Wales iron industry and related canals and tramways went, in trust, to the younger sons of his brother James as tenants-in-common. The trustees were to manage the works with full rights as owners, including the power to sell; Penydarren was sold to the Dowlais Iron Company for &pound;59,875 in 1859.<br>
<br>Although the iron industry formed the basis of Thompson's fortune, his interests were diverse. The centre of his business career was in London. Through his interests in marine insurance, he was most actively and publicly involved in shipping. In 1720 the Royal Exchange Assurance and London Assurance were granted a monopoly of marine insurance by corporations, and the act also prohibited underwriting by partnerships. The result was to stimulate individual underwriting, which was organized at Lloyd's Coffee House. An attack on the monopoly of the Royal Exchange and London assurance companies was, therefore, an indirect attack on Lloyd's. In 1806 and 1810 assaults on the monopoly failed; in 1824 the outlook was less auspicious when Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777&#150;1836) and other City figures, including Alexander Baring, Samuel Gurney, and Moses Montefiore, launched the Alliance British and Foreign Fire and Life Insurance Company. The Alliance was, in the opinion of one critic, &#145;the whole united money interest of the empire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 11, 1824, 928), and it had the support of the government. William Huskisson, for example, was prepared to see Lloyd's destroyed. &#145;Unquestionably, the public would go wherever they could get their business done in the best and cheapest manner. And why, he begged to ask, ought they not to be permitted to do so?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 2</span>, 11, 1824, 772). Such a view was firmly opposed by Thompson, who had entered parliament in 1820 as member for Callington in Cornwall:<blockquote>So far from creating competition, the present bill, when passed, will only give rise to a new monopoly in the establishment of a huge, all-absorbing joint-stock undertaking. Everybody knows that it is impossible to have more and sharper competition in marine insurance than exists at present. There are more than a thousand underwriters at Lloyd's, and competition is as open to the insurer who goes to the Royal Exchange as Mark Lane is open to the corn merchants and Mincing Lane to the sugar dealers. (Martin, 295)</blockquote>In the event, most marine insurance continued to be effected at Lloyd's, and Thompson served as chairman of its committee from 1825 until he was obliged to resign as a result of criticism of his joining the Sunderland Shipowners' Mutual Assurance Association. Unfortunately, it is not possible to establish how active he was in underwriting and how far this contributed to his considerable fortune.<br>
<br>Thompson's subsequent parliamentary career was marked by his staunch defence of the navigation laws. He followed the line of London shipowners such as Joseph Somes and G. F. Young that shipping had been in decline since Huskisson's reforms in the 1820s. Although the navigation laws might be modified, Thompson was opposed to their repeal which could destroy British shipping and the security of the country. The question of repeal, he informed the Commons, was &#145;one of the greatest national questions which had been discussed in modern times&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 99, 1848, 35&#150;43). He may also have invested in shipping, as was common for many merchants in the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Thompson was a leading figure in the City and public life from the 1820s. In 1821 he became an alderman of the City; he retained the position to his death, and was lord mayor in 1828&#150;9. He was active in his livery company, the Ironmongers' Company, of which he was master in 1829 and 1841. He was also president of Christ's Hospital from 1829 until his death; treasurer of King's College; and colonel of the Royal London militia from 1851 to 1854. He became a director of the Bank of England in 1829, and remained on the court until his death. His standing in the City was confirmed by his election, at the head of the poll, as one of its MPs in 1826. He was, nominally, a whig and moderate reformer, but he received tory support as a result of his opposition to Catholic emancipation. He was re-elected in 1830 and 1831, but in 1832 he stood for Sunderland as a moderate whig and advocate of the repeal of the corn laws. He came bottom of the poll, but was elected in 1833 and was again returned in 1837.<br>
<br>By this time, Thompson was associated with the tories and by 1841 had shifted to support agricultural protection. Although re-elected for Sunderland in 1841, he resigned his seat in order to stand for Westmorland, which he represented from that year until his death. He opposed the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span>, and he voted against repeal of the corn laws which he considered a concession to the unconstitutional power of the Anti-Corn Law League. He was a leader of City Conservatism, and part of the world of protection which was overturned in the 1840s as the City was remade in an open, competitive form with which he had little sympathy. At the same time, the south Wales iron industry was passing its peak of prosperity.<br>
<br>Thompson, one of the wealthiest and most important figures in the City, owned a fortune considered to be on a par with James Morrison (1790&#150;1857) and Nathan Mayer Rothschild. The comparison with Morrison is more apt than that with Rothschild, for Thompson did not create a continuing presence in the City. In association with Isaac Lyon Goldsmid (1778&#150;1859) Thompson was involved in managing remittances for the payment of the dividends on the Brazilian debt to Portugal, which was taken over by the Rothschilds on his death. He was almost certainly involved in various other City ventures, as a director or investor: there is, for example, a passing reference to his involvement in the Santiago Mining Company. However, Thompson, like James Morrison and Morrison's son Charles, increasingly concentrated on accumulating railway stocks (he acted as chairman of the Cambrian and the Gloucester and London railways) and, above all, land. The explanation was, in part, that his only child was a daughter, Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1864). In 1842 she married the earl of Bective (1822&#150;1894), who became third marquess of Headfort; his family held considerable landed estates in Ireland.<br>
<br>It was claimed by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> after Thompson's death in 1854 that Thompson lived well below his means, and he certainly invested heavily in both land and railway shares. A few months before his death he purchased the Barnacre estate from the duke of Hamilton for &pound;98,000, and he also owned the Underley estate at Kirkby Lonsdale. In the new <span class="roman">Domesday</span> survey of 1883 the estates were recorded as being held by his son-in-law and amounted to 12,851 acres in Westmorland with a gross annual value of &pound;13,686; 4534 acres in Yorkshire with a gross annual value of &pound;2305; 3393 acres in Lancashire with a gross annual value of &pound;4198; and 178 acres in Glamorgan with a gross annual value of &pound;42  (Bateman, 214). The Headfort estates in Ireland had by this time a gross annual value of &pound;19,372 and the land accumulated by Thompson in England and Wales &pound;20,234.<br>
<br>Thompson died on 10 March 1854 at Bedwellty House, Monmouthshire. His estate was sworn at under &pound;900,000 in Canterbury, &pound;60,000 in York, and &pound;16,000 in Ireland, which excluded the investment in land. He had been one of the greatest figures in the City of London in the 1830s, and a significant ironmaster in south Wales. His wife died in 1861 and his daughter in 1864, and his considerable fortune disappeared&#151;in common with the Crawshays and his partner William Henry Forman&#151;into the landed &eacute;lite without leaving any apparent dynastic trace.<br>
