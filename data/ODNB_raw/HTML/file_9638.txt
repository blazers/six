<span class="headword">Fitzroy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Howard]</span>,  Mary</span>, duchess of Richmond  (<em>c.</em>1519&#150;1555?), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13940/', "Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk (1473&#150;1554)")</script>, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13897/', "Elizabeth Howard (1497&#150;1558)")</script>, eldest daughter of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, and his wife, Lady Eleanor Percy. The ages of her siblings suggest that she was born about 1519 and she spent her childhood at Tendring, Hundson, and Kenninghall, all in Norfolk. Arrangements for a marriage with Lord Bulbeck, heir of the earl of Oxford, were abandoned when in December 1529 Henry VIII proposed one of Norfolk's daughters should marry his illegitimate son. Norfolk always maintained the king instigated the match, but his wife later attributed it to the influence of Anne Boleyn. On 1 September 1532 Mary had a prominent role in Anne's creation as marquess of Pembroke and afterwards attended her as queen. Mary embraced the changes in religion, moving her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13905/', "Henry Howard, styled earl of Surrey")</script>, to seek to dissuade her from going too far in reading the scriptures. In September 1533 she carried the chrism at Princess Elizabeth's baptism. While at court she was a major contributor, together with Margaret Douglas and Mary Shelton, to the anthology of poetry known as the Devonshire manuscript (BL, Add. MS 17492).<br>
<br>On 26 November 1533 Mary Howard was married, with a dispensation for relation in the fourth degree of consanguinity, to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9635/', "Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond (1519&#150;1536)")</script>, only illegitimate son of Henry VIII and his mistress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73234/', "Elizabeth Blount")</script>. Due to their youth the union was not consummated. A portrait by Hans Holbein, commissioned after her marriage, was never completed; the work was perhaps interrupted by Richmond's death, on 23 July 1536. The widow retired to Kenninghall, but the king refused to acknowledge her rights, and she struggled to obtain her jointure. Both she and her father made repeated attempts to press her suit. However, the king's position had nothing to do with the validity of her union, but reflected the uncertain standing of the Howards at this time. In July 1536 Mary herself had fallen under suspicion of having furthered Margaret Douglas's clandestine relationship with Thomas Howard. Not until the Howards' return to favour did she receive (11 March 1539) the first of a number of grants, which by 1540 assured her of a jointure worth over &pound;700 a year. In the interim she incurred numerous debts, being forced to sell her jewels in an attempt to make ends meet. Plans to place her in Anne of Cleves's household in January 1540 were frustrated when the new queen brought her own attendants.<br>
<br>Although Mary Fitzroy did return to court following Henry VIII's brief marriage to Katherine Howard on 28 July 1540, there was no repetition of the marked favour she had enjoyed under Anne Boleyn, and she was never to remarry. Her father's plan in 1538 for a betrothal to Sir Thomas Seymour of Sudeley, younger brother of the late Queen Jane, was approved by the king, perhaps with the expectation of being released from any financial obligation towards her. However, she remained determined to secure recognition of her status as dowager duchess of Richmond. The proposal was revived in 1546 as part of a suggested triple alliance, also involving the offspring of her brother Henry, and Thomas's brother Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford. Again she rejected the match. In 1547 Sir Garwen Carew testified &#145;her fantasy would not serve to marry with him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/227, fol. 105). Her brother Henry scathingly suggested that she might instead use this opportunity to become the king's mistress. On these grounds she has been vilified by Howard biographers for her role in Surrey's execution, on 19 January 1547.<br>
<br>After the arrest of her father and brother in December 1546 Mary Fitzroy was interrogated by the king's commissioners. Much of her deposition descended into reports of the earl's posturing and name-calling. Writing in 1938 Edwin Casady condemned the petty nature of her testimony as &#145;evidence that she was vindictive [and] bitter &hellip; eager to do anything to harm her brother&#146;  (Casady, 199). Mary's intentions were perhaps more laudable. &#145;Some passionate words of her brother she likewise repeated, as also some circumstantial speeches little for his advantage, yet so as they seemed much to clear her Father&#146;  (Herbert, 626). On the crucial, and only significant, point of Surrey's armorial bearings she was so vague that her evidence was no more instrumental in condemning her brother than in securing her father's release. Under Edward VI, Mary continued to petition the council without success. As a Howard, a member of a staunchly Catholic family, her enthusiasm for the protestant faith was sometimes regarded with caution, but her patronage of John Foxe and John Bale suggests she was a willing convert. From 1548 she undertook the upbringing of Surrey's children, engaging John Foxe as tutor. After Queen Mary's accession in 1553 Mary Fitzroy maintained a tactful distance from court. She died perhaps in December 1555 and was buried beside her husband in St Michael's Church, Framlingham, Suffolk.<br>
