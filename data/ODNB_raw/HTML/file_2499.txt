<span class="headword">Black,  William</span>  (1841&#150;1898), <span class="occ">journalist and novelist</span>, was born at Glasgow on 9 November 1841, the son of James Black (<i>d</i>. 1855), a merchant. After receiving his education at various private schools, he studied landscape painting for a short time in the Glasgow School of Art, but, becoming connected with the <span class="italic">Glasgow Citizen</span>, gradually exchanged art for journalism. His contributions to the <span class="italic">Citizen</span> included sketches of the most eminent literary men of the day.<br>
<br>In 1864 Black published his first novel, <span class="italic">James Merle: an Autobiography</span>, which was a total failure. In the same year, after an unhappy love affair with an actress, he went to London and built up a reputation as a contributor to the magazines. He married a German woman, Augusta Wenzel, on 8 April 1865. She died in May 1866, and left him a son, who died in 1871. In 1865 he became connected with the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, and in the following year went to Germany as its correspondent in the Franco-Prussian War. As he himself admitted, he had no special qualification for the part except for a smattering of German. During most of the very short campaign he was under arrest on suspicion of being a spy, but the observations he made in the Black Forest aided the success of his third novel, <span class="italic">In Silk Attire</span> (1869), partly set there. He had already, in 1867, produced <span class="italic">Love or Marriage</span>, which was unpopular on account of its discussion of delicate social questions, and which he spoke of later as &#145;fortunately out of print&#146;. The success of <span class="italic">In Silk Attire</span> helped <span class="italic">Kilmeny</span> (1870), a story equally delightful for its sketches of artistic life in London and its rural scenery, and <span class="italic">A Monarch of Mincing Lane</span>; but the author's first real triumph was won by <span class="italic">A Daughter of Heth</span> (1871). Here he was most fortunate in his subject, depicting the transformations and tragic adventures of a lively French girl, a coquette, transplanted into a Scottish puritan family. <span class="italic">The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton</span> (1872) was even more successful, and introduced what became Black's special characteristic: so thorough a combination of scenes of actual experience in travel and sport with fictitious adventures that readers sometimes hardly knew whether they were reading a book of travel or a novel. After the interruption of publication of the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span> Black became connected with the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1870, and was for some time assistant editor, but retired from journalism upon gaining an assured position as a novelist. In 1874 <span class="italic">A Princess of Thule</span> thoroughly confirmed his reputation. It was very popular in both England and America and was translated into German, Russian, and Swedish; Queen Victoria even had an imaginary portrait of the heroine painted for her private collection. Both in this book and in <span class="italic">Madcap Violet</span> (1876), as previously in <span class="italic">A Daughter of Heth</span>, the delineation of young female characters was particularly successful. In 1874 Black married Eva Simpson, the daughter of a journalist.<br>
<br>Black was a very entertaining author, and continued to maintain his popularity to the end of an active career, although he never regained the level of the best work of his middle period. The most remarkable of his later novels were <span class="italic">Macleod of Dare</span> (1878), the story of a highland chief who discovers London; <span class="italic">Sunrise</span> (1880), a controversial picture of international socialism; and <span class="italic">Judith Shakespeare</span> (1884), a romance about the dramatist's daughter. He also wrote the study on Goldsmith in the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series (1878). A collected edition of his works in twenty-six volumes appeared between 1892 and 1894. Although lacking in extraordinary incidents or situations and in subtlety, his novels were built on precise and exhaustive descriptions which won the admiration of many readers, among whom was Ruskin, who commended warmly their closely observed picturesqueness.<br>
<br>Black was wealthy enough to spend most of his time in travelling and yachting, and his amusements helped to provide material for his novels. His permanent residence was Paston House, 1 Paston Place, Brighton, where he was a liberal host. He died at his home after a short illness, on 10 December 1898. He was buried on 15 December within a few yards of Sir Edward Burne-Jones in Rottingdean churchyard. A William Black memorial lighthouse tower, designed by William Leiper RSA and erected on Duart Point in the Sound of Mull, was lit for the first time on 13 May 1901.<br>
