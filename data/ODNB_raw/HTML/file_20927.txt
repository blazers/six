<span class="headword">Oswine</span> <span class="st"> [St Oswine, Oswin]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 651), <span class="occ">king of Deira</span>, was the last independent ruler of Deira, the southern part of Northumbria. His father was the apostate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20905/', "Osric (d. 634)")</script>, but Oswine is portrayed by Bede as a model of royal submission to the authority of the church. Following his father's overthrow in 634 he is said to have been taken to Wessex. His rival <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu (d. 670)")</script>, who became king of Bernicia in 642, appears to have been unable to establish his authority over Deira, despite marrying <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8392/', "Eanfl&#230;d")</script>, a member of the Deiran royal family and Oswine's second cousin. Oswine became king in Deira two years later (644 deduced from Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.14; 643 in the E text of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>). His attractive personality and appearance are described in unusual detail by Bede, who notes that his bounty attracted followers from other kingdoms. Despite his rule in the southern part of Northumbria, he appears to have accepted the authority of the Irish mission based in Bernicia.<br>
<br>Bede's principal story about Oswine concerns his complaint about &Aacute;ed&aacute;n's misuse of a gift he had given him, the bishop's reproof, and Oswine's acceptance of that criticism. This level of humility was inappropriate for an Anglo-Saxon ruler, and despite Bede's praise of his ability to attract a retinue, when Oswiu finally moved against him, Oswine was forced to dissolve an outnumbered army and was murdered in the company of a single follower, through the treachery of one of his thegns. The murder took place on 20 August 651, at a place called &#145;Ingetlingum&#146;. As Bede says that the army was dissolved near Catterick, this has been taken to be Gilling West, north Yorkshire; the alternative identification, as Collingham, west Yorkshire, is based on a speculation by Daniel Haigh (<i>d</i>. 1879). Oswiu was induced by his wife, Eanfl&aelig;d, to compensate for the murder by founding a monastery at Gilling, where another blood relative, Trumhere, became first abbot. Oswine was omitted from Alcuin's poem on the rulers and saints of York, but evidence for a growing cult is suggested by his inclusion in the eighth-century calendar of Willibrord, although on 19 rather than 20 August.<br>
<br>Bede does not directly state that Oswine's body was buried at the newly founded monastery. His cult was revived four centuries later when it was claimed that his body had been discovered on 11 March 1065 at Tynemouth, a former Bernician monastic site near Newcastle, after he had appeared in a vision to the priest there, named &AElig;dmund. This claim is complicated by several factors. A later king of Northumbria, Osred (<i>d</i>. 792), is the only royal burial recorded at Tynemouth and the names may have been confused. Also, Tynemouth monastery was initially claimed by Durham, but later given to St Albans by the earl of Northumberland in 1090 following a dispute. The account of Oswine's rediscovery in 1065 appears in a life written about the year 1111 in the interests of St Albans (edited by J. Raine in 1839); but a rival account from early twelfth-century Durham claims that his bones were exposed by &AElig;lfred Westou, a priest of Durham, and that in 1075 these were granted, together with the church at Tynemouth, to the Jarrow monks who subsequently formed the community at Durham  (Symeon of Durham, <span class="italic">Opera</span>, 1.88, 124&#150;5).<br>
<br>The St Albans life of St Oswine  (BL, Cotton MS Julius A.x) was composed by an anonymous monk of St Albans, later prior of Wymondham, a year after the translation of Oswine's body to a new shrine in the newly completed church of St Mary at Tynemouth, which took place on 20 August 1110, the anniversary of his death. It includes a copious list of miracles ascribed to Oswine's intervention, with subsequent additions. The offices for his festival are given in a fourteenth-century abridgement of this life by John of Tynemouth (BL, Cotton MS Tiberius E.i; Oxford, Corpus Christi College, 134 edited by C. Horstmann in 1901). A now badly damaged psalter fragment bearing the inscription &#145;Liber Oswini Deiorum regis&#146; (&#145;the book of Oswine, king of the Deirans&#146;; BL, Cotton MS Galba A.v) is certainly much later, probably dating from the revival of his cult in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Oswine's shrine was broken up at the Reformation in 1539.<br>
