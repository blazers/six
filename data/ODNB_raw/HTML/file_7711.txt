<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobbs,  Arthur</span>  (1689&#150;1765), <span class="occ">colonial governor and writer on trade</span>, was born at Girvan in Ayrshire on 2 April 1689, the son of Richard Dobbs, army officer and future high sheriff of Antrim, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. before 1711), daughter of Archibald Stewart of Ballintoy. Richard Dobbs, a supporter of the protestant interest in Ireland, had sent his pregnant wife to Scotland to avoid the fighting which followed the revolution of 1688&#150;9. Mary and her child returned to Ireland at the peace and settled in the family's residence, Castle Dobbs in co. Antrim. Prior to his father's death in 1711 Arthur Dobbs served in the British dragoons in Scotland. In 1719 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1747), daughter of John Osburn, a London silk dyer, and the widow of Captain Norbury; the couple had three children. After inheriting his father's property, he became sheriff of Antrim in 1720, represented Carrickfergus in the Irish parliament in 1727&#150;30, and in 1728 became deputy governor of Carrickfergus. In 1730 the archbishop of Armagh introduced Dobbs to Robert Walpole, who in 1733 appointed him engineer-in-chief and surveyor-general in Ireland. Although Walpole's fall from power in 1742 was a set-back, Dobbs secured other patrons, notably lords Hertford, Holdernesse, and Halifax, who helped secure his appointment as governor of North Carolina in 1754, a colony in which he was already a substantial landowner thanks to his association with Henry McCulloh.<br>
<br>The quarter-century that Dobbs spent seeking preferment was uniquely creative. He made himself useful to Lord Halifax, president of the Board of Trade from 1748 to 1761, and Lord Holdernesse, a privy councillor and trusted prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the duke of Newcastle, by drafting lengthy proposals about Irish and colonial affairs which combined scrupulous research with bold and candid advocacy of policies for strengthening and reforming the empire. His two-part <span class="italic">Essay on the Trade and Improvement of Ireland</span> (1728, 1730) advocated relaxation of restrictions on Catholics and the benefits of free trade between England and Ireland. His unpublished &#145;Scheme to enlarge the colonies and increase commerce and trade&#146; (<i>c</i>.1730) fused imperial energy with Anglican piety. Historically, Dobbs argued, empires had arisen from either &#145;thirst for dominion&#146; or a more mature appetite for trade and commerce. Domineering imperialism tended to become self-destructive, and even commercial empire needed a mature metropolitan economy to absorb colonial wealth and free institutions (especially churches) to discipline and channel the energies and desires of the colonial populace. The British empire of the Augustan age, Dobbs warned, was in danger of degenerating from a commercial to a domineering regime because African slavery institutionalized human exploitation, and the dispossession of the Indians from their ancestral lands perverted Britain's civilizing mission and threatened a whirlwind of retaliation. In the long run both Africans and Indians would have to be incorporated into the colonial populace, but for the immediate future Britain should invest massive sums in Anglican missionary work so that both minorities could be converted to Christianity and brought under the protection and blessing of the Church of England:<blockquote>Shall we, who by the precepts of our Lord and Saviour, ought to love our neighbours as ourselves &hellip; instead &hellip; pride our selves by our superior knowledge in arts and sciences and despise them as an inferior race, not worthy of reclaiming? (Calhoon, 59&#150;60)</blockquote>Dobbs's Irish sensitivities, his personal stake in colonial development in the prosperity and development of North Carolina, and his career ambitions as a crown official were a volatile and potentially creative compound of attitudes, temperament, and ideology. His friend and early patron, Lord Hertford (who had introduced him to Holdernesse), frankly warned both Dobbs and Holdernesse that his visionary proposals for reforming English&#150;Irish relations could wreck his career. The rebuke only spurred Dobbs to bolder advocacy for the reform of Irish policy. Dobbs's experience in Scotland, moreover, convinced him that free trade could effect the same social miracle in Ireland that it had in Scotland. Dobbs's encyclopaedic knowledge of Irish economic problems, especially the wool trade, were of a piece with his candour, eloquence, and sense of imperial urgency. He argued cogently for a strengthening of the North American colonies as the best preparation for the inevitable next war with France, and the implication that a distressed Ireland threatened Britain's national security lay just below the surface of his policy recommendations. Dobbs's ability to incorporate a radical indictment of exploitation and injustice into writings on Irish and colonial policy administration was typical of Anglican&#150;Irish political discourse in the age of Swift and Burke, and he was one of the foremost Irish protestant &#145;commonwealth men&#146; of the eighteenth century  (Robbins, 149&#150;51).<br>
<br>Dobbs's governorship in North Carolina (1754&#150;65) was one of the most significant in the colony's proprietary or royal history. No governor in any of the southern royal colonies worked as hard or manoeuvred as adroitly as Dobbs to curb legislative autonomy and maintain his own and the Board of Trade's influence over appointments and fiscal policy. He recognized that the assembly's control of the colony's accounts undermined imperial administration, and he waged a persistent and fruitless campaign to curb this crucial means of legislative supremacy. He regained royal control over the way the assembly spent the money reimbursed by the crown for provincial military expenditures during the Seven Years' War. He worked closely with the Board of Trade to influence the extension of legislative representation to new towns. He sought to limit the power of John Starkey, the colony's treasurer, a creature of the legislature whom Dobbs considered a &#145;professed violent Republican&#146;, and he resisted assembly efforts to make the office of colonial printer a legislative prerogative. But Dobbs also recognized that, by respecting custom and practice in the administration of the court system, he could most effectively serve the crown's long-term interests, and he risked censure in London for concurring with the legislature on issues of the independence of the judiciary.<br>
<br>Dobbs's skill and patience in dealing with the assembly and his tenacity in seeking to curb legislative power set the stage for the pre-uprising struggle, between 1765 and 1775, over the ultimate location of authority. Neither a high-handed villain nor an ambitious careerist, Dobbs exemplified British administration at its best. His character and conduct taught North Carolina leaders that they would have to become more than a legislative opposition; they would need to become arbiters of the public good and defenders of both liberty and order. Dobbs died at his home in Brunswick, North Carolina, while packing to return to England, on 28 March 1765, and was buried in the town's St Philip's Church.<br>
