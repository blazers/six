<span class="headword">Wells,  Samuel</span>  (1614&#150;1678), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born on 18 August 1614 in St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, and baptized there on 24 August, the son of William Wells of Oxford. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 11 May 1632, graduated BA from New College on 27 June 1633, and proceeded MA from Magdalen Hall on 3 May 1636. He was ordained as deacon in Salisbury on 25 September 1636 as curate at Ashbury, Berkshire, and was for some time a schoolmaster at Wandsworth, Surrey. In 1637 he married Dorothy Doyley of Wiltshire; the couple had ten or eleven children, including a son, William, and daughter, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1669). During the civil war Wells served as chaplain to Colonel Charles Essex's regiment in 1642. After his chaplaincy he was made vicar of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, on 9 October 1643. Subsequently he was given, by the Westminster assembly, on 1 July 1646, the lucrative sequestered rectory of Remenham, Berkshire, where, with only about twenty households in the parish, he had little work to do yet &pound;200 per annum of living. Therefore when the House of Lords ordered, on 13 September 1648, that &#145;Dr Bennet give Institution and Induction unto Sam. Wells clerk, to the vicarage of Banbury, in the County of Oxon.&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 10, 1647&#150;8, 501), although it carried far less remuneration Wells took this ministry opportunity with enthusiasm and eager expectation.<br>
<br>One of Wells's early accomplishments in Banbury was organizing an anti-regicide campaign in which he, along with eighteen other ministers in Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire, condemned the proceedings of the high court of justice against Charles I. This resulted in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The humble advice and earnest desires of certain well-affected ministers &hellip; of Banbury in the county of Oxon &hellip; to his Excellency Tho. Fairfax: presented 25 January 1649 by two of the subscribers</span> (1649). The two presenting subscribers were Wells and John Bayley of Fringford, Oxfordshire. In 1654 Wells, along with John Owen, Thomas Goodwin, and others, was appointed a member of the commission for Oxfordshire to reject incompetent and scandalous ministers. Moreover, the trustees for maintenance of ministers granted an annual augmentation of &pound;30 to his salary. As the Quakers gained greater numbers of converts, including some within Oxfordshire, Wells became affected by this overtly anti-clerical movement. In 1654 he brought charges against Anne Audland, who had called Wells a &#145;false prophet&#146; and was incarcerated for blaspheming against the Lord's servant. In a letter dated 27 July 1655 Thomas Curtis, a former captain in the parliamentary army, accused Wells of being unnecessarily severe in his dealings with Audland. The same year Wells was reprimanded by a certain Sarah Timms who called him to &#145;fear the Lord&#146;; in return Timms was imprisoned for six months.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1661 Wells wrote to Richard Baxter enquiring of Baxter's view on the imminent and increased pressure to conform exerted by the Restoration Church of England, so as to &#145;reduce the publick worship of God to the forme of that Liturgy which was formerly in use in England&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.15). Eventually, refusing the terms of conformity set forth by the Restoration church settlement, Wells was ejected from his living in November 1662. However, he soon became the leader of the group which, having seceded from the parish church, formed a presbyterian conventicle. He continued to live and minister in Banbury until the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> of 1665, which prohibited former parish incumbents from coming within a 5 mile distance of their parishioners, forced him to move to Deddington, Oxfordshire. Although removed from Banbury he wrote weekly letters of encouragement and spiritual counsel to his erstwhile congregation, and in 1669 he was preaching at Adderbury, Bicester, and elsewhere in Oxfordshire. Wells's farewell sermon at Banbury, <span class="italic">The Spiritual Remembrancer</span>, based on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 20: 27 was published in 1676, along with the regular letters to his former flock. <span class="italic">The Spiritual Remembrancer</span> shows the typical puritan casuistical genre of epistolary counselling and pastoral guidance.<br>
<br>After Charles II issued the indulgence of religion on 15 March 1672, Wells returned to Banbury and, being a man of considerable means, bought a house and took a licence to preach as presbyterian at his residence or that of James Sutton of Banbury, on 20 April 1672. He is said to have kept a cordial relationship with the new incumbent of Banbury, Dr Richard White, maintaining a &#145;very fair and friendly correspondence&#146; in which White said, &#145;I pray God bless your Labours in private, and mine in publick&#146;. Wells died in June or July 1678 in Banbury, and was buried there on 7 July. His wife survived him.<br>
