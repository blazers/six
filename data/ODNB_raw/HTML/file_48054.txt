<span class="headword">Society of Antiquaries</span>  (<em>act. </em>1586&#150;1607)<span class="occ"></span> constituted a group of scholars whose coming together was the culmination of a process that had begun with John Leland's <span class="italic">New year's gift to King Henry the VIII</span> (1546) and his <span class="italic">Itinerary</span> (1550), and was developed thereafter in works like William Lambarde's <span class="italic">Perambulation of Kent</span> (1570). These works sprang from anxiety about the loss of objects that in post-Reformation England were in danger of destruction as idolatrous, notably funerary monuments and Catholic books, but which nevertheless deserved preservation for their association with the nation's history. In 1561 a petition led to a royal proclamation against the defacement of tombs, and the attempts to moderate religious fervour inherent in the Elizabethan religious settlement also helped to curtail the losses. But it was the Society of Antiquaries who arguably did most to develop a historical perspective able to accommodate such potentially dangerous survivals from the past. <h2>
<a name="WilliamCamdenandthefoundationofthesociety"></a>William Camden and the foundation of the society</h2>The dissolution of the monasteries created a landscape full of monuments, signs pointing into a vacuum where a historical and cultural identity had previously been sited. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4431/', "William Camden")</script> describes in the preface to his great chorographical work <span class="italic">Britannia</span> (1586), the grief and curiosity he felt when as a boy he walked among these ruins. Determined to reconcile Britain to the past represented by these slighted antiquities, he spent years walking across the counties of England, Wales, and Scotland, recording inscriptions, turning over stone heaps to find more, inquiring of gentry what had been taken from monasteries and of farmers what they had turned up when ploughing fields. The <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was the product of these walks. More continental than British in criticizing a Trojan foundation (even though Camden shrank from rejecting it altogether), the <span class="italic">Britannia</span> combined Flavio Biondo's archaeology, Guillaume Bud&eacute;'s numismatics, and Conrad Gesner's encyclopaedic bibliography. It defined its subject only with reference to what could be attested in the extant record: objects, inscriptions, interviews, and documents. A nuanced philology helped to reconstruct what could be known about the past, in &#145;Celtic&#146;, Roman, Saxon, Norman, and late medieval times, county by county. As discussions of evidence are nearly as frequent as narrative, the <span class="italic">Britannia</span> proved a work of massive length, and Camden himself admitted turning his back on refinements of literary style. The result was an abstruse and difficult work whose scholarly Latin is regularly interspersed with Anglo-Saxon, and which embraces languages as distant as Persian. Nevertheless it was surprisingly popular, inspiring poets and playwrights like Edmund Spenser and Michael Drayton. <br>
<br>Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> exerted a great, even directive, influence on Elizabethan scholars. Its preoccupation with the accumulation of evidence created a long-lived tradition of historiographers who were &#145;not quite historians&#146; because they insisted on system rather than chronology, and because they collected all facts, rather than those that fitted into a narrative. The <span class="italic">Britannia</span> was not in fact entirely Camden's work, for he had drawn upon the researches of many scholars. But, as a common enterprise, it helped propagate common skills and habits among the members of the Society of Antiquaries. In particular they were expert in epigraphy and palaeography, and familiar with a wide variety of languages from several periods. The <span class="italic">Britannia</span> similarly provides a model for their work, which can be best understood as interconnected parts of a vast historiographic programme, rather than as individual, narrative, or even patriotic histories with conventional subjects. Its example did much to promote a collaborative scholarly enterprise&#151;what Lambarde described as &#145;joining our pennes and conferring our labours&#146;  (dedicatory letter, Lambarde, v). <br>
<br>Although the date at which that enterprise first took a settled form is not entirely clear, and the year 1572 was often proposed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the preface that Sir Henry Spelman wrote in the late 1620s for his treatise <span class="italic">The original of the four terms of the year</span> implies strongly that it was in 1586 that<blockquote>Gentlemen in London, studious of Antiquities, fram'd themselves into a College or Society of Antiquaries, appointing to meet every Friday weekly &hellip; [T]wo Questions were propounded at every Meeting to be handled at the next that followed &hellip; That which seem'd most material, was by one of the Company (chosen for the purpose) to be enter'd in a Book; that so it might remain unto Posterity. (Van Norden, 134&#150;5)</blockquote>It is possible that the <span class="italic">Britannia</span> merely gave focus to an informal group that was already meeting, but no satisfactory evidence has been found for the activities of such a group. <h2>
<a name="Activitiesandmembership"></a>Activities and membership</h2>Manuscript copies of summonses, discourses, and papers exist from thirty-eight meetings between 27 November 1590 and 21 June 1607; except in the plague years 1594&#150;8 these were held every Friday during the law terms, most often at Derby House, the seat of the College of Arms. Some are reprinted in Thomas Hearne's <span class="italic">A Collection of Curious Discourses</span> (1720, enlarged edition 1771). Topics for discussion were arranged in advance. Though it was agreed that they should be limited to British sources, they covered a great range of subjects, including legal history, land tenure, numismatics, inscriptions, heraldry, medals, and devices, along with the records, collections, lineages, rights and properties of monarchs and nobles, and of religious foundations, colleges, hospitals, corporations, cities, and towns. Funerary customs, the use of sterling money and the introduction of trial by combat into England were all discussed, as were all kinds of surveys, whether of counties or parishes. While disagreements were not unknown, it seems that the Elizabethan society was as much concerned to collect and preserve antiquities as to deliver definitive judgements upon them. <br>
<br>The exact membership of the Elizabethan society is unknown. Spelman's list identifies at least thirty-seven members but may contain errors and almost certainly suffers from omissions. Hearne's <span class="italic">A Collection of Curious Discourses</span> identifies others, as does a list in Arthur Agarde's hand  (BL, Harley MS 5177, fols. 48ff.). These and other sources indicate that there must have been yet others as well. While the exact membership was probably not a concern to the Elizabethan society, it is undoubtedly greater than the names attested in these sources. As well as Camden the list must include at least the following: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/206/', "Arthur Agard")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1804/', "Robert Beale")</script>; Henry Bourchier or Bouchier; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37211/', "Robert Bowyer")</script>; Richard Broughton; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4635/', "Richard Carew")</script>; either Richard or John Clyffe; William, second Baron Compton; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6257/', "Walter Cope")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6425/', "Robert Cotton")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7245/', "John Davies")</script> (and another man of that surname, unidentified); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7558/', "William Dethick")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8015/', "Dr Thomas D'Oyly")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7745/', "John Dodderidge")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8834/', "Sampson Erdeswick")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9690/', "William Fleetwood")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11891/', "William Hakewill")</script>; Abraham Hartwell; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12919/', "Michael Heneage")</script>; Joseph Holland; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15102/', "William Jones")</script>; Charles Lailand; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15903/', "Thomas Lake")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15921/', "William Lambarde")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16382/', "Francis Leigh")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16619/', "James Ley")</script>; Arnold Oldisworth; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21573/', "William Patten")</script>; Robert Plott; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24741/', "John Savile")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26104/', "Henry Spelman")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26611/', "John Stow")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69727/', "James Strangman")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26942/', "Thomas Talbot")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26981/', "Francis Tate")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27420/', "Francis Thynne")</script>; William Thynne or Thinne; Robert Weston; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29299/', "James Whitelocke")</script>; Thomas Wiseman; and also perhaps <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/520/', "Lancelot Andrewes")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2800/', "Edmund Bolton")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3585/', "Hugh Broughton")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5826/', "Edward Coke")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27627/', "Hayward Townshend")</script>. <h2>
<a name="Tworepresentativemembers"></a>Two representative members</h2>Of the men listed, many were lawyers, many were or became knights, and many were landed gentlemen, often lords of manors. Almost all were university educated, with slightly more from Oxford than from Cambridge. A notable minority were accused, or even confirmed, recusants. Few were clergy, though some had close connections with the established church. One such man was <a name="cosubject_12507"></a><span class="headword">Abraham Hartwell</span>  (1553/4&#150;1606)<span class="occ"></span>, who attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1568, graduated in 1572, and became a fellow in 1574. He then entered the service of John Whitgift, accompanying him to Worcester in 1577. By 1583 he was a notary public, by 1584 Whitgift's secretary. No doubt it was thanks to the archbishop that Hartwell became MP for East Looe in 1586 and Hindon in 1593. He had become a member of the Society of Antiquaries by 1600, when he described himself as &#145;in time the last that was admitted into this society&#146;  (Hearne, 1771, 2.375). In that year he contributed to the discussion of epitaphs, referring to one at Lambeth and another at Cambridge, and he is also recorded as presenting a paper on heraldic mottoes. <br>
<br>Hartwell's most important contribution to scholarship was as a translator. Between 1595 and 1604 he published three translations from Italian and one from French, the former all dedicated to Whitgift. The first of these, <span class="italic">The history of the warres betweene the Turkes and the Persians</span> (1595), is described as completed in &#145;houres &hellip; stollen from your Grace's graver businesses whereon I should have attended&#146;  (sig. A4). It was followed in 1597 by <span class="italic">A report of the kingdome of Congo</span>, an English version, amplified by woodcut plates and a map, of an Italian translation of the Portuguese original by Duarte Lopes. In his address to the reader Hartwell explains that he had been pressed by Richard Hakluyt to translate it, and presents as his primary motive a desire to advance missionary activity. Then in 1599 he published a translation from the French of a case of fraudulent demonic possession, with a dedication to Richard Bancroft, bishop of London, and finally, on 1 January 1604, in &#145;this my Quinquagenarian yere of Jubile&#146;, he produced a translation, <span class="italic">The Ottoman of Lazaro Soranzo</span>, describing how he had been prompted to &#145;thrust it forth&#146; by a question put to him by Whitgift concerning the promotion of the grand vizier at the sultan's court. Hartwell made his will on 7 December 1606  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/109, fols. 47<i>v</i>&#150;49). He named as his executor &#145;my derely beloved wiefe Elizabeth&#146;. She was the daughter of Robert Garnet of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where she inherited lands. They had a son John, who was still a minor when his father died, and to whom Abraham bequeathed purchased estates in Thanet, Kent, and Cheshunt, near Broxbourne. His cousin Robert Wright, parson of Woodford, Essex, received many of his &#145;books of divinity, humanitie, polymathie or of any other profession whatsoever&#146;. Hartwell had died by 17 December 1606, when he was buried at Lambeth. <br>
<br>Few members of the Society of Antiquaries were heralds. Relations with the College of Arms cannot have been inherently unfriendly, since the Society met at Derby House, but the factious state of the college may have limited the membership of heralds, for fear they would bring their quarrels with them. Many members had heraldic interests, however. A good example is <a name="cosubject_48054"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Holland</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1605)<span class="occ"></span>, who also illustrates some of the virtues and shortcomings found among the less celebrated members of the society. Born at Weare in Devon, Holland was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1571, and continued to live in London, where on 16 May 1575 he married Angella Bassano, presumably a member of the celebrated family of musicians. Their son Philip was born on 14 March 1576. Angella had died by 24 October 1584 when Holland married Sara Hewett, also of London, with whom he had two sons and a daughter, and whom he made his sole legatee and executor on his deathbed in November 1605. He was granted a coat of arms on 28 September 1588, appropriately, in the light of his own heraldic collections, which included one for his native county, recorded in the College of Arms in the eighteenth century. He was typical of members of the Society of Antiquaries in that he lived in London (he still had chambers in the Inner Temple in 1601), where a residence was probably essential, since attendance at meetings seems to have been required. As these were held during the law terms, members with country residences might not have been completely excluded, but they would not have been easily able to participate. Holland had become a member of the society by 3 June 1598, when he spoke concerning the antiquity of English cities, declaring that &#145;I have divers antiquities in coin stamped at several times in England&#146;, the oldest &#145;a British piece of gold&#146; from Colchester  (Hearne, 1771, 1.38). He collected documents too, among them a charter of King Edgar and a deed of the Edward, the Black Prince, and manuscript volumes, notably the mid-thirteenth-century almoner's cartulary from Reading Abbey (now BL, Cotton MS Vespasian E.v) which John Dodderidge gave him on 16 May 1605. Holland also noted monumental inscriptions and other physical remains of the past, for instance Maiden Castle, Dorset, and the prehistoric barrows surrounding it. The twenty papers that he is recorded as giving to the society show him to have been a careful observer and assiduous collector, but fallible in his judgements. Thus he confidently derived sterling money from its having been first struck by Edward I at Stirling in Scotland; better-informed colleagues contradicted him. <h2>
<a name="Thehistoriographyofthesociety"></a>The historiography of the society</h2>The writings of Elizabethan antiquaries circle around a few historiographical poles, notably the use of legal and heraldic sources and the collection of evidence in the form of manuscripts, coins, and marbles. Some authors followed in Camden's footsteps by publishing chorographies, a form defined by a contemporary as &#145;the description of some particular place, as Region, Ile, citie, or such like portion of the earth severed by it selfe fro the rest&#146;  (Mendyk, 23). The results varied widely, embracing John Stow's scholarly and affectionate <span class="italic">Survey of London</span> and Richard Carew's more exuberant <span class="italic">Survey of Cornwall</span>, as well as many less personal productions, like the history of Norfolk, in Latin, that Sir Henry Spelman left unfinished at his death. Equally closely linked to antiquarian concerns was a large body of legal writing: many antiquaries searched the evidence of the past to find arguments for legal positions, reaching back as far as the ancient Hebrews for arguments on natural law. Besides religious sources, Spelman cites linguistic and textual evidence from Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic sources. Francis Thynne discusses the legal functions of ambassadors with reference to etymological and philological evidence. William Lambarde comments on the high courts of justice by relating them to Hebrew precedents in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, as well as to what was then known about Anglo-Saxon and Norman courts. Robert Cotton used antiquarian evidence to defend the rights of parliament and to assert the primacy of the king of England over the king of Spain. A few antiquaries, including John Stow and William Thynne, also took an interest in literary editing: Stow and Thynne collaborated on an edition of Chaucer, and Stow published a selection of Skelton's poetry. There was an abiding interest in language. <br>
<br>The work of the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries has been described as Baconian, or inductive, both in its reasoning style and in its focus on collecting data. Many antiquaries were indeed collectors, involved in determining the provenance of objects from medieval texts to Roman pavements. Both acquisition and cataloguing required serious financial commitment. Robert Cotton is the prime example. His manuscript collection included the Lindisfarne gospels, two contemporary copies of the <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, the only surviving copy of the poem <span class="italic">Beowulf</span>, many medieval cartularies and chronicles, and numerous Anglo-Saxon texts. Before the disastrous fire in Ashburnham House in 1731, in which a number of manuscripts were utterly destroyed and still more were damaged, Cotton's collections had been even greater. An eighteenth-century list, complemented by John Speed's <span class="italic">History of Great Britain</span>, indicates that Cotton's coins included Greek, Roman, and ancient British specimens, along with 160 Anglo-Saxon coins (the first scholarly collection of these ever assembled in Britain) as well as Norman and later ones. Cotton's marbles included significant finds from Hadrian's Wall, together with Romano-British inscriptions. Some of the Cotton manuscripts came from the royal library. Stories of antiquaries' acquisitiveness were not uncommon. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Cotton and his contemporaries were not above failing to return books and manuscripts that had been lent to them. <h2>
<a name="ThedemiseoftheElizabethansociety"></a>The demise of the Elizabethan society</h2>About 1602 Cotton, Ley, and Dodderidge petitioned Queen Elizabeth for the incorporation of a library and academy to support English historical scholarship, a &#145;Collegium Antiquariorum&#146;. A draft for a royal charter was composed  (BL, Cotton MS Faustina E.v, fol. 12) but the project failed. Some five years later the society itself was brought to an end. The causes of its demise in 1607 are obscure. There is manuscript evidence for society meetings until about 1607&#151;also the year of the sixth and final edition of the <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. But no documentation survives from the period following 1608, strongly suggesting that the society discontinued its meetings at that time. Spelman's account attributes its cessation to the deaths of members, which is certainly relevant in some cases. On the other hand, his reference to &#145;some Rules of Government and Limitation&#146; as proposed for a re-formed society in 1614, &#145;That for avoiding Offence, we should neither meddle with Matters of State, nor of Religion&#146;  (Van Norden, 135), also points to possible reasons for the society's earlier discontinuance. At the end of the sixteenth century its discussions had become increasingly concerned with political issues, and in the years immediately after the accession of James I they had been specifically directed towards religious topics as well. It may be, therefore, that government pressure had brought meetings to an end. If so, Spelman clearly hoped that the hiatus would only prove temporary. His optimism would not have been unreasonable. Society members still alive in 1614, like Robert Cotton, had not ceased to be active in the collection and preservation of antiquities. Camden was still publishing. It cannot be supposed that informal discussions had not occurred between friends and colleagues in the years since 1607. Perhaps, then, prudent members planned to refrain from investigating subjects that seemed provocative to James I, whom they believed disliked their proceedings. If so, their hopes of renewed activity were disappointed. Before they could meet again they learnt that &#145;his Majesty took a little Mislike of our Society&#146;  (ibid.) and the attempt to relaunch it was abandoned. Nothing survived except its name when the Society of Antiquaries of London was founded in 1717.<br>
