<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Buttall,  Jonathan</span>  (1752&#150;1805), <span class="occ">ironmonger</span>, the possible subject of Thomas Gainsborough's painting <span class="italic">The Blue Boy</span>, was the eldest of the three sons of Jonathan Buttall (<i>d</i>. 1768), ironmonger, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Higgins (<i>d</i>. 1780). He was probably born at the family's house in King Street, Soho, London. Jonathan was the last in a line of three generations of ironmongers who worked either in Wrexham or London. His grandfather, Jonathan Buttall (1693&#150;1761), a freeman of the City of London, had married Priscilla Beale (<i>b</i>. 1700) at St Michael Cornhill on 19 January 1719. By June 1721 the couple had moved to premises in King Street previously occupied by Priscilla Beale's parents. From then until December 1796 the Buttall family occupied two (and later three) adjoining houses in the parish of St Anne's, Soho, on the north side of King Street, shown on Horwood's <span class="italic">Plan of London</span> as numbers 68, 69, and an unnumbered house at the corner with Greek Street. Jonathan followed his father, grandfather, great-uncle 
    (Joseph; <i>d</i>. 1726)
   and uncle 
    (James; 1718&#150;1792)
   into the ironmongering trade, from which he was said to have become &#145;an immensely rich man&#146;  (Smith, 301).<br>
<br>After the death of his parents and brothers, Buttall's business ran into financial difficulties as a result of a difficult trading market, perhaps caused by fears of a French invasion of England in the 1790s. As a result, a &#145;commission of bankrupt&#146; was awarded against him, and in 1795 he was sued by a creditor for more than &pound;3000. In December of the following year, the stock-in-trade of Buttall's business and other property was sold by Sharpe and Coxe, auctioneers. The sale included a valuable collection of drawings and paintings by the artist Thomas Gainsborough (1727&#150;1788). The close friendship between the Buttall family and Gainsborough may have begun in the 1750s during the artist's days in Ipswich where the Buttalls are thought to have had property  (Whitley, 378). Jonathan was probably the Mr Buttall present at Gainsborough's funeral at Kew on 9 August 1788, an occasion attended, as the artist requested, only by a few of his most respected friends.<br>
<br>The collection of paintings sold in 1796 included the portrait that came to be known as <span class="italic">The Blue Boy</span>&#151;now one of Gainsborough's, and the period's, best-known works&#151;which is generally thought to be a portrait of Buttall as a child. The portrait depicts a youth of approximately fourteen or fifteen years with collar-length dark brown hair, dressed in a fine blue suit in the Van Dyck style. In his right hand he holds a wide-brimmed hat with plumes, and his left is placed on his hip. The precise date of the portrait, which is accepted to be Gainsborough's homage to Anthony Van Dyck, remains unknown. It is thought to have been the <span class="italic">Portrait of a Young Gentleman</span> exhibited at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1770, but if the sitter is Jonathan Buttall, it must have been painted around 1766&#150;7. It is possible that Buttall may have sat for the portrait during a family trip to Bath; local newspapers record visits to the town by a married couple of this surname&#151;perhaps Jonathan's uncle James and his wife&#151;in 1764 and 1774. The painting may have come into the family's possession through James on his later visit, just before Gainsborough's move to London. The first connection between the portrait and a &#145;Mr Buttall&#146; was made by Edward Edwards in his <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painters</span> (1808). It was affirmed in November 1832 by the elderly artist John Taylor who, in a conversation reported by the printmaker John Thomas Smith, identified the &#145;Blue Boy&#146; as &#145;an ironmonger &hellip; He lived at the corner of Greek and King Streets, Soho&#146; (quoted in Whitley, 373). For Whitley, Jonathan Buttall remained the &#145;supposed original of the picture&#146;. However, the uncertainty over the portrait's date leaves open the possibility that, while <span class="italic">The Blue Boy</span> is &#145;generally considered to be a portrait of Jonathan Buttall&#146;  (Sloman, 74), the sitter could be&#151;as Sloman suggests&#151;the artist's nephew, Gainsborough Dupont, who was two years younger than Buttall.<br>
<br>On 31 March 1798 Buttall married Mary Jump (1739&#150;1826) at St Marylebone Church, London; the couple had no children. A note in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> in July 1798 shows that, despite the sale of his property, he was paying a bankruptcy dividend to his creditors some months after his marriage. During his last years Buttall lived at 241 Oxford Street, London, as a neighbour to his lifelong friend and executor, the coach builder Philip Godsal (1747&#150;1826). Buttall died from &#145;spasms&#146; at his home on 29 November 1805, aged fifty-three. The <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> (2 December) described him as a &#145;Gentleman whose amiable manners and good disposition will cause him to be ever regretted by his numerous and respectable friends&#146;. Buttall was buried in a vault at St Anne's Church, Soho, on 6 December 1805. He was survived by his wife, who died at 236 Oxford Street and was buried beside her husband on 31 March 1826.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Blue Boy</span>, the name by which Gainsborough's portrait was known by the late 1790s, was bought in 1796 by the politician John Nesbitt and purchased in his sale in 1802 by the artist John Hoppner. It was subsequently acquired by the second Earl Grosvenor about 1809, and remained in the possession of the dukes of Westminster until purchased by Joseph Duveen in 1921 and sold to the American collector Henry Huntington. One of Gainsborough's most iconic images, <span class="italic">The Blue Boy</span> now hangs in the H. E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, California.<br>
