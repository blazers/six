<span class="headword">Brady,  William</span>  (1881&#150;1960), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born in Yorkshire Street, Salford, son of John Brady, commission agent, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanoran. Known as Billy, he attended St John's Cathedral Boys' School in Salford and went to work with his two brothers at a local cable manufacturing business. He played rugby league for the factory team and later for Salford as a half-back. Brady and his brothers took bets at work, giving them to their father when they went home.<br>
<br>Since the passing of the <span class="roman">Betting Houses Act</span> in 1853 cash betting on horse-races away from the racecourse had been unlawful, but the activity remained popular among working-class people. In 1902 the Bradys were caught by the management and were sacked. Billy Brady then became a full-time illegal bookmaker. It is likely he took bets on the street, but in 1906 the <span class="roman">Street Betting Act</span> forced bookies into spots more protected from the police. The housing in Salford was mostly two-up, two-down and at the rear of each terrace there ran a common entry or passage. Brady set up a pitch in the backyard of the family's home: his punters (or customers) came up the entry and handed him their bets and cash over the yard's wall.<br>
<br>During the First World War Brady served with the Royal Army Service Corps, becoming a sergeant and taking part in the battle of the Somme. On leave in 1915 he married his fianc&eacute;e, a shop assistant called Ellen Devine (<i>b</i>. 1883/4), on Christmas day; they had three daughters and two sons. His wife helped greatly in his bookmaking business, which he expanded after his discharge. He took over several pitches and was acknowledged as the biggest bookmaker in Salford. Most bookies protected themselves against large pay-outs by imposing a limit on the amount that could be won on a certain kind of bet. Brady was regarded as the founder of no-limit betting. He had a large notice painted on the end of his pitch proclaiming &#145;world record payout&#146; to an old lady who had won several hundred pounds for an outlay of 6<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Street bookies were decried by some people as immoral and unchristian. Others felt they drew the working class away from political action and encouraged wasteful spending. These negative images were reinforced by Walter Greenwood in his powerful novel <span class="italic">Love on the Dole</span>, written in 1933. Set in Hanky Park, Salford, it features the notorious bookie, Sam Grundy. Small and fat with beady eyes, sporting diamonds of a preposterous size and a collection of gold pendants, spade guineas, and masonic emblems, suggestively Grundy boasts that he has no limits.<br>
<br>Many working-class people, however, looked on street bookies more positively. A former detective recalled Brady &#145;as a benefactor of the Catholic church rather than a criminal, despite the illicit status of his business&#146;  (Davies, 155). This opinion was widespread locally, and he was regarded as a good churchman and family man with a strong social concern, who sponsored parties and outings for the young and underprivileged. A governor of many schools, he was said to have an affable disposition and be unassuming and modest. He died at home at Southwood, Old Hall Lane, Worsley, Salford, on 12 September 1960, the year in which off-course cash betting was legalized. Following a requiem mass at St John's Cathedral, Salford, he was buried at St Mary's cemetery, Wardley. He was survived by his wife.<br>
