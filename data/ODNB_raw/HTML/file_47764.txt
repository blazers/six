</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayub Khan, Mohammad</span>  (1907&#150;1974), <span class="occ">president of Pakistan</span>, was born on 14 May 1907 at Rehana, in the Hazara district of the North-West Frontier Province of undivided British India. He was the fifth child of Mir Dad Khan, a retired Indian army junior officer. The family were comfortably off, but not wealthy members of the Tarin. They were &#145;lowland&#146; Pushtuns whose native tongue was Hindko. Ayub was thus culturally isolated during his youth from the Pushtun nationalism of Abdul Ghaffar Khan's Khudai Khidmatgar movement. Ayub's later contribution to Pakistani nation-building was to lie not by the way of Pushtun nationalism, but by co-opting the Pushtun to the project of a centralized state.<br>
<br>His pious father had earmarked Ayub for religious training rather than a military career. These hopes were ended when the adolescent Ayub slapped the village <i>maulvi</i> (priest) when he chastised him. Ayub seemed far more interested in horse-riding than in studying, but Mir Dad Khan insisted that he be sent to the prestigious Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh in the United Provinces. Here Ayub met Muslims from across northern India and gradually improved his Urdu pronunciation. He also imbibed the college's modernist approach to Islam which was to be a hallmark of the social and religious policy of his later rule.<br>
<br>Ayub sailed for England in July 1926 to take up a scholarship at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned in 1928. He saw active service in Burma during the Second World War as the second in command of the 1st Assam regiment. In August 1947 he was appointed as an advisory officer to the ill-fated Punjab boundary force commanded by Major-General Rees. This force lamentably failed to prevent the massacres which accompanied the partition of the Punjab following independence. Ayub was later to date his distrust of politicians and his insistence on a strong army from this experience. These sentiments were reinforced during his posting as general officer commanding in East Pakistan from January 1948 onwards. He experienced the Bengali language riots and the turbulent student movement in Dacca at first hand. On 17 January 1951, shortly after his return to West Pakistan, he became the first Pakistani commander-in-chief, replacing the remaining British general, Douglas Gracey. From October 1954 to August 1955 Ayub also served as minister of defence. This was a period during which power was increasingly slipping from the politicians to the ailing, but authoritarian governor-general, Ghulam Muhammad. Ayub shared with Ghulam Muhammad and, later, with his successor Iskander Mirza, a distrust of the apparently chaotic democratic process. Ayub's main concern was to strengthen the Pakistan army, and to this end he was instrumental in forging closer security ties with the United States. The fear that these ties might be endangered if Bengali politicians from the more populous eastern wing of the country held power in the wake of Pakistan's first projected national elections precipitated the military coup of 8 October 1958. Some five months earlier Mirza and Ayub had separately conveyed their opinion to the US ambassador that &#145;only a dictatorship would work in Pakistan&#146;. Following the coup President Mirza named Ayub as chief martial law administrator. But the Mirza&#150;Ayub duumvirate lasted only until 27 October, when Mirza was deposed and shunted off to exile in London. Ayub Khan then became president of Pakistan, a post which he was to hold for over a decade.<br>
<br>Ayub sought to ensure political stability through a system of &#145;guided democracy&#146;. This was to provide the platform for the modernization of the country. Its key components were land reform, and social reforms such as the Muslim family laws ordinance of 15 July 1961. Ayub also believed that rapid economic growth led by the private sector would assist the modernization process. Political parties were banned until July 1962, and the freedom of many individual politicians to take part in public life was restricted under the accountability process instituted by Ayub. These measures had an especially alienating impact in East Pakistan, where the Bengali &eacute;lite had always looked to democratic politics rather than to influence in the bureaucracy and army to make its voice heard. The basic democracy scheme was introduced in 1959. This consisted of a five-tier structure of representation. Direct elections were held only at the lowest tier of union councils, and even here up to a third of the voting members could be nominated. The 1962 constitution created a powerful president who was to be elected by the 80,000 &#145;basic democrats&#146;. Although Ayub claimed that the system was to provide a training in citizenship, it was primarily intended to create a loyal support base for his regime. However, when Ayub's fortunes began to decline the basic democracy scheme proved a useless prop.<br>
<br>Ayub's social and economic reforms had a more lasting impact. The 1959 land reforms, with their high ceilings and generous compensation, were far from radical, but they did encourage the shift in parts of the Punjab from feudalism to capitalist farming, and the Muslim family laws ordinance formed the high-water mark of Islamic modernist influence with its establishment of arbitration in divorce cases and its discouragement of the contraction of polygamous marriages. The <i>&#145;ulama&#146;</i> (religious scholars), however, branded these reforms un-Islamic and were henceforth implacably opposed to Ayub's government.<br>
<br>Ayub Khan attached so much importance to economic advancement that he assumed the chairmanship of the planning commission in 1961. Compared with other developing countries, however, the key role in economic growth was given to the private sector. This reflected the preferences of the United States, which was Pakistan's major aid-giver. Rapid growth was achieved, including a rise in per capita income of 14 per cent during the period of the second five year plan (1960&#150;65). But this growth-orientated strategy of directing resources to an entrepreneurial &eacute;lite generated increasing social and regional tensions.<br>
<br>With the restoration of the political parties following the lifting of martial law and the introduction of a new constitution in 1962, discontent was increasingly channelled into opposition to the regime. Ayub was uncomfortable with his new political role (from December 1963) as head of the &#145;court party&#146; Convention Muslim League. Although he won the tightly controlled 1965 presidential election contest against Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Pakistan's founder, the campaign revealed growing discontent. This was increasingly orchestrated by his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; and foreign minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto had split with Ayub after his alleged betrayal of Pakistan's interests in the 1966 Tashkent treaty. This had been brokered by the Soviet leader Kosygin in the wake of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, which had been caused in part by the infiltration of insurgents into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Ayub's acceptance of a ceasefire on 22 September 1965 had shocked a populace fed on a diet of victory reports by the state-controlled media.<br>
<br>Popular disturbances from November 1968, sparked by clashes between students and the police, lost Ayub the support of his former army colleagues. By March 1969 he was forced to step down in favour of General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan. Ailing with heart problems, Ayub lived in quiet retirement in Islamabad, and died there on 20 April 1974. His son, Gohar Ayub, after an army career, rose to prominence in contemporary Pakistan politics.<br>
<br>Ayub Khan is remembered as a hard-headed administrator whose modernizing impulses foundered because his regime never acquired political legitimacy. Despite his best intentions, the &#145;golden decade&#146; of development exacerbated class inequalities and Bengali grievances.<br>
