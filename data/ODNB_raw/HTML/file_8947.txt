<span class="headword">Evans,  Cornelius</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1648), <span class="occ">impostor</span>, is said to have been born at Marseilles, of a Welsh father and a Proven&ccedil;ale mother. Nothing is known of his early life, but it was reported in 1648 that he spoke English &#145;not perfectly and in another dialect than it is usually pronounced by Englishmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 955). Despite his slight resemblance to Charles Stuart, prince of Wales&#151;the future Charles II&#151;he was &#145;shorter than the Prince by the head, a little bowed in his shoulders, with hands like to a butcher's boy's hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Declaration</span>, 1). Evans himself claimed that he was a poor gentleman who had been in the service of the king, but a parliamentarian newsletter sneered that he was &#145;well known in London especially at some of the common gaols&#146;  (<span class="italic">Perfect Weekly Account</span>, 29 May 1648). In early May 1648 Evans was lodging in the house of Nicholas Evans, a seaman, in the parish of St Katharine by the Tower, London. Seeking shipboard work, but failing to find it, he set out on foot shortly afterwards for the channel ports.<br>
<br>Whether Evans had yet hatched the idea of impersonating Prince Charles is unclear. Having walked from London to Dover, he set off for Deal, and there fell into the company of dissident sailors from the ship <i>Providence</i>. At this meeting the idea of an imposture (whoever suggested it) was agreed. Evans later tried to implicate Vice-Admiral Thomas Rainborowe in the business, but he and his new friends quietly left Deal, where Rainborowe was governor, and made instead for Sandwich, the sailors by means of a longboat, and the &#145;prince&#146; on foot. It was here that his imposture was launched. Arriving probably on 17 May, Evans refreshed himself at the Bell tavern, with a butcher, Casimir Mathew, and a victualler, Charles Baron, while the sailors (including some officers) spread the news of the princely presence. A Captain Henry Foster was persuaded of Evans's royal status and presented him to William Mandey, the mayor. To Mandey the visitor explained that his mother, Queen Henrietta Maria, had sought to poison him, forcing him to flee in haste from France. When it was proposed to carry him to London so that parliament could verify his credentials, Evans found a reason for refusal which conflicted with his first explanation: Kent and other counties:<blockquote>had declared their affections to settle him and his father in their rights, and that therefore he was come over to join with them, and that his intent is to assist them to the bringing of the king his father to London. (<span class="italic">A Letter from Kent</span>, 5)</blockquote>It seems that Evans had concocted the poisoning story in advance, but that a sceptical response decided him to risk taking advantage of the loud rumblings of rebellion newly heard in Kent.<br>
<br>Despite this inconsistency, Evans's claims were treated as true until proved otherwise. Lodged at Captain Foster's house, he held court: &#145;many gentlemen and women came daily to kiss his hand, and many presents he had made him&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Letter from Kent</span>, 6). A gentlewoman, revealed Evans later, brought him &#145;one hundred pieces of gold and three bunches of asparagus&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 1647&#150;8, 300). He had arrived in Sandwich &#145;in an old black ragged suit, with no companions but lice&#146;, but the authorities accepted that this misfortune stemmed from the hardships of his escape  (Carter, 43). They put to work the tailors of the town, and on Sunday 21 May the eminent visitor was able to attend church:<blockquote>in a rich suit lined with crimson satin, and laced with gold and silver lace. One Thomas Richards, a man of an extraordinary stature, was chosen to carry the sword &hellip; [he] walking before him in a slow and stately posture, commands the people to bear back: and cries out, &#145;Room for the Prince&#146;. (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 953)</blockquote>At Foster's house dinner was taken in the grand manner, &#145;trumpets sounding his meat to the table most commonly&#146;  (Carter, 44). Evans promised a knighthood to his host and posts to various others.<br>
<br>Evans's imposture was reported to have received crucial support: &#145;certain ancient servants of the king then in the town being desired to give their attestation who by a great mistake did all affirm that it was the prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 953&#150;4). The presence of navy officers and sailors may also have exerted influence, especially if, as seems likely, they were armed. The mayor and jurats were suspicious, and sent to parliament a detailed description of their guest, set down by the town clerk, James Thurburne. On 20 May the committee of both houses wrote back, explaining that whereas Thurburne had depicted a blond-haired man with light skin:<blockquote>the Prince himself is of a black complexion and very black hair&#151;we are fully satisfied he is only an imposter, and doth now appear of purpose to raise tumults and insurrections in the county. We therefore desire you to take special care for securing the person of the above said man. (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1648&#150;9</i>, 73)</blockquote>But in Sandwich there were the sailors, and many others, who believed Evans's claims. Even doubters understood his value as a figurehead:<blockquote>it is believed by most of judgement that it is not the prince; but that he was one that was appointed to have been reputed so, to have animated the cavaliers to join in a speedy body, out of this and some other counties. (<span class="italic">A Letter from Kent</span>, 6)</blockquote>Meanwhile there had arrived at Dover a servant to the queen, Sir Thomas Dishington, who was startled to hear of his young master's presence at Sandwich, since he had only just received from the real prince a letter sent from the court of St Germain, in Paris. He persuaded the mayor of Dover to send an express to Sandwich, explaining that Charles was still in France. But Mandey was unmoved, so on Saturday 20 May Dishington hastened there himself. What he found on arrival was Evans, &#145;delighting himself in the town haven with the pleasures of hunting the duck &hellip; in a boat attended by many of the chiefest inhabitants&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kingdomes Weekly Intelligencer</span>, 955). As Carter remarked, this was &#145;indeed a Welsh prince but not the prince of Wales&#146;; Sir Thomas, &#145;being much incensed, called him villain, and counterfeit rogue&#146;  (Carter, 43). But Evans had already grown accustomed to his part, and was equal to the challenge. Feigning high indignation, he &#145;commands the Mayor to clap Sir Thomas up in prison for his treason; the mayor presently obeys his command&#146;  (ibid.). The mayor may have had less choice than this implies, for as Dishington explains, it was the mayor &#145;with 20 or 30 mariners&#146; who effected his arrest, and &#145;presently committed me to the common gaol&#146;. There he remained until, on Sunday, several friends arrived from Dover to vouch for him  (<span class="italic">A Declaration</span>, 1). In the evening Dishington was released. Confronting Evans for a second time, he demanded to know the names of the prince's servants, and posed other questions designed to expose before the governors of Sandwich the falsity of the man he knew to be a fraud.<br>
<br>Evans's failure to answer was not immediately fatal to his scheme. The authorities did not rearrest Dishington, and gave him permission to leave the town. Many of the inhabitants, however, had other ideas:<blockquote>the women, and mariners would have stoned me in the streets, for not confessing that rogue to be the Prince: when we got to our horses, they refused to let us out at Dover gate, and beat us back with halberts, we were forced to take us to Canterbury gate, where with much ado we got out. (<span class="italic">A Declaration</span>, 2)</blockquote>It is also likely that the defectors from the <i>Providence</i> remained in Sandwich and continued to champion Evans's cause. Caught between conflicting forces, it seems that the town authorities, though aware that his imposture could no longer be doubted, still hesitated to arrest and expose the counterfeit prince.<br>
<br>On Tuesday 23 September parliament sent a second order demanding that Evans be secured, and instructed Rainborowe to take him by force if the Sandwich authorities should prove obstructive. That day, however, rebel Kentish troops under the command of Sir Richard Hardress and captains Hamond and Carter gained entry to the town and quickly imposed their authority. Would they recognize the pretended prince? At first the rebel commanders were uncertain. Captain Carter paid Evans a visit &#145;to satisfy not only himself, but some deputy lieutenants in the county whether it were he or not&#146;  (Carter, 43). By Friday, it seems, they too had become convinced of Evans's imposture and sought to persuade him to leave quietly with them, for &#145;the hearts of the people were much inclined to him&#146;  (ibid., 44). But Captain Foster, Evans's host, was one of the believers. When the &#145;prince&#146; declined the rebel leaders' offer of a coach, Foster refused to admit them, even when confronted by sixty musketeers; and &#145;now the whole town grew into a mutiny, and distraction&#146;  (ibid., 45). The officers:<blockquote>commanded all houses and shops to be shut up. Meanwhile this young imposter, ranting in his new invested authority, waves his hat and plume out at the window, calling out, &#145;raise the town, raise the town; seamen, stand to me seamen&#146;, throwing out handfuls of money into the streets among the people, which began to swarm up and down in throngs and tumults;</blockquote>these street scenes &#145;would have ended in much mischief, had not the gentlemen bestirred themselves resolutely, and undauntedly in the quelling of them&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>At length Evans was taken by his followers from the house, &#145;through the backside; and some seamen waiting purposely at the waterside, transported him immediately over into the Isle of Thanet&#146;  (Carter, 45). Here, it seems, Evans may have been handed over to the parliamentarian authorities by means of Sir Nicholas Crisp, the customs farmer and sequestered royalist of Birchington, Thanet, for the committee of both houses summoned him to appear before them on Saturday 27 May and that day or the next Evans was found in Thanet, &#145;at Mr Crispe's house at supper&#146;  (Carter, 46). Taken to Rochester and examined by the mayor, Philip Ward, and a JP, George Newman, Evans made a full written confession which revealed his true identity. He was taken to London and appeared before the House of Lords, who consigned him to Newgate. Mysteriously, Evans was able, or was enabled, to escape from his confinement. On 5 June he signed a letter addressed to his role model, the prince of Wales, in which he recommended his services. It may be assumed that Charles did not reply. The following month the real prince left for England to reclaim it for the Stuarts, but the attempt met with no more success than that of his imitator. Evans had already vanished into the mist, as quickly as he had appeared.<br>
