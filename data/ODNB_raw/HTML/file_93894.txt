<span class="headword">Feilden,  Geoffrey Bertram Robert <span class="st"> [Bob]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2004), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born on 20 February 1917, at 31 Meadway Court, Golders Green, London, the oldest of five sons of Captain, later Major, (Robert) Humphrey Feilden, an officer in the Royal Field Artillery, and his wife, Olive, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Binyon. His father was the victim of a gas attack on the western front later in the First World War; this led to his being medically advised to take up residence in the beneficial climate of British Columbia, western Canada. The family settled on a ranch near Mara, where Feilden first attended school. As a young boy he showed an interest in elementary technical science, experimenting with a defective telephone system and spending time exploring Leclanch&eacute; cells. After the death of his father while bathing in a nearby lake, in 1925 Feilden was sent to England to continue his education. He attended school in Hampstead, was a scholar at Bedford School, and was an exhibitioner at King's College, Cambridge. Between Bedford School and Cambridge he worked as an apprentice at the engineering company British Thomson&#150;Houston, in Rugby; he also attended a course in engineering drawing at Rugby Technical College. He went up to Cambridge in 1936 to read for the mechanical sciences tripos. During the university long vacation of 1937 he joined the engineering firm of Brown Boveri, in Baden, Switzerland, on a two-month vocational apprenticeship. For the following year's long vacation he was sent to serve as fifth engineer on a tanker to gain experience of large, low-speed marine diesel engine problems. He gained a first-class honours degree in 1938 then, seemingly to expand his industrial and managerial knowledge, stayed on for a further year taking the economics part 2 tripos, in which he obtained second-class honours. He came to doubt the value and wisdom of trying to secure profound knowledge of industrial management by taking an economics degree&#151;a not uncommon disappointment at that time.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge Feilden joined Unilever in Port Sunlight as a technical trainee, but soon after the outbreak of the Second World War he was seconded to Power Jets Ltd&#151;seemingly in view of his recent experience working on gas turbines at Brown Boveri Ltd. He came to manage engine test programmes and in April 1941 the new W1 engine he had helped develop was flown for 200 yards. This went on to be bettered until full confidence in its future was well established by the successful trial flight of the Gloster&#150;Whittle E28/39 in May 1941. Production of the engine was thereafter revolutionized, but with inspection and experiment being closely monitored by Feilden's group. The strong limitations of time-honoured diesel engines were exposed and then surpassed, with air transport now able to become revolutionized. Feilden moved on from Power Jets in 1946 but only after a tour delivering repetitions of Whittle's Thomas Hawksley prize lecture of 1945, which stimulated widespread interest in improving industrial gas turbines.<br>
<br>Feilden joined Ruston and Hornsby Ltd of Lincoln in 1946 (the year of his marriage to Elizabeth Ann Gorton, with whom he had a son and two daughters), his reputation having been urged on the company in order to develop industrial gas turbines. As chief engineer he worked on engine designs which could cope with fast changes of load and temperature. Start-up times of 1 minute were soon achieved, and the response from across the country, especially the oil industry, was immediate. Prospects of great reductions in the weight of equipment were soon envisaged. Feilden left Ruston and Hornsby early in 1959 to become managing director of Hawker Siddeley Brush Turbines Ltd, then a company building steam and gas turbines but one deficient compared with Rustons. It seems that it was a transfer decision he regretted. Two years later he moved to Davy&#150;Ashmore Ltd as group technical director but this appointment also gave rise to no prodigious technical breakthroughs.<br>
<br>In recognition of the quality and quantity of his scientific work and publications, Feilden had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1959. He proved a valuable member of the society, serving two periods on its council and making substantial contributions especially on its official visits overseas, such as to the Soviet Union in 1963 and India in 1967; the former country was helped to overcome its technical isolation and the latter was looking for advice regarding the expansion of its own gas turbine establishment. He also visited China (twice) and Brazil under Royal Society auspices. With the former, views were exchanged about international standardization; with the latter Feilden discussed expansion of its automobile industry.<br>
<br>The so-called &#145;Feilden report&#146;, <span class="italic">Engineering Design</span>, was published in 1963; it had been called for by Lord Hailsham, when minister of science. Some 10,000 copies were published. An encapsulating phrase frequently used in it was that &#145;In [engineering] design, everything matters&#146;; the importance and value of good design, and of design education for engineers, were heavily underlined. As a consequence of the report a design advisory service was created by the Design Council and forty-three guides were offered regarding diverse subjects. For his work in connection with the report Feilden was appointed CBE in 1966. Two years later he became deputy director-general of the British Standards Institution, becoming director-general in 1970 and holding that post until 1981. As director-general he sought to improve design through a ten-year programme of metrication and in anticipation of the problems confronting a European Common Market. Recommendations for the development of design quality assurances, nationally, were started in 1979. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in 1961 in divorce, on 27 December 1972 he married (Elizabeth) Diana Angier, a 53-year-old widow, and daughter of Percy Charles Lloyd, solicitor.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from the British Standards Institution, Feilden moved from Henley-on-Thames to a house at Painswick, Gloucestershire&#151;a region where he had long desired to live. His new property was large and included a swimming pool; he was also able to indulge himself in many other favourite outside activities, especially photography. He continued to tackle issues such as those raised by standards unification, with occasional visits to South Africa, Canada, and mainland Europe. He also now found time for his great personal interest in mechanical rotating machinery, and enjoyed the company of his neighbour Alex Moulton, a prolific inventor. Furthermore, he was able to set up his own company, Feilden Associates Ltd, for consultancy work. Opportunities to continue old and treasured friendships with former colleagues from the Royal Society and the Academy of Engineering were also made the most of. He was disappointed at not being elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. However, with the Royal Society he helped instigate several professional lectures on design. He also helped set up, from 1998, an annual prize award at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for young engineers writing on &#145;aerospace propulsion&#146;. He died in the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, Gloucester, on 1 May 2004, and was buried in Gloucester Cathedral. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Wilton Place, London, on 28 September 2004. He was survived by his wife, Diana, the three children of his first marriage, and three stepchildren.<br>
