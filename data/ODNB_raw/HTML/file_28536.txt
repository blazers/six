<span class="headword">Wallace, Sir  James</span>  (1731&#150;1803), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, details of whose parents and upbringing are unknown, entered the navy as a scholar in the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth in 1746. He afterwards served in the <i>Syren</i>, <i>Vigilant</i>, and <i>Intrepid</i> and passed his lieutenant's examination on 3 January 1753, being described on his certificate as &#145;appearing to be 21&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 107/4). On 11 March 1755 he was promoted lieutenant in the <i>Greenwich</i> under Captain Robert Roddam and was in her when she was captured off Cape Fran&ccedil;ois in the West Indies on 16 March 1757. In April 1758 he was appointed to the <i>Ripon</i> (60 guns, Captain Edward Jekyl), one of the squadron under Sir John Moore at the reduction of Guadeloupe in April 1759. In January 1760 he was appointed to the <i>Neptune</i> (90 guns) when she went to the Mediterranean as flagship of Sir Charles Saunders. On 1 November 1762 he was promoted commander and in the following April he was appointed to the sloop <i>Trial</i> (14 guns) for the North American station. He later commanded the <i>Dolphin</i> (24 guns) in the East Indies and the <i>Bonetta</i> in the English Channel. On 10 January 1771 Wallace was promoted captain of the <i>Unicorn</i>, and in November 1771 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Rose</i> (20 guns) which he took to the North American station in 1774. In the course of 1775 and the first part of 1776 the <i>Rose</i> was actively engaged in operations designed to maintain a sense of insecurity among the rebels in the small towns and harbours along the coast. His activity attracted the attention of Rear-Admiral Shuldham who wrote to Philip Stephens at the Admiralty: &#145;Captain Wallace's services deserve every reward that can be conferred on him. I humbly recommend it to their Lordships' consideration sending him out a larger and better ship&#146;  (ibid., 1/484, fol. 378). Perhaps as a consequence he was given the <i>Experiment</i> (50 guns) in July 1776. In her, he was sent to England with dispatches in January 1777, a service for which he was knighted on 13 February.<br>
<br>In July Wallace returned to the North American station and to his earlier cruising activities. In July 1778 the <i>Experiment</i> became one of the small squadron which Vice-Admiral Richard Howe assembled for the defence of the channel past Sandy Hook against the fleet under d'Estaing. The <i>Experiment</i> continued with the squadron when Howe followed the French to Rhode Island, and took part in the manoeuvres on 10&#150;11 August at the end of which, just as battle was to be joined, both fleets were scattered by a storm. The <i>Experiment</i> remained in the area and on 20 August was off Newport when the French were standing in towards it. On 23 August the <i>Experiment</i> was chased into Long Island Sound by three French line ships, thus becoming &#145;the first two decker that ever attempted that dangerous passage&#146; (that is, Hell Gate, the East River connecting Long Island Sound and New York harbour)  (Beatson, 4.354), and rejoined Howe at Sandy Hook on 25 August. In the following December, while cruising on the coast of Virginia, the <i>Experiment</i> was blown off the land in a violent westerly gale. Wallace, conscious that his ship would find it hard to get to New York in her distressed condition, and knowing that the dockyard could not supply the spars and rigging he needed, bore away to the east to be refitted in an English dockyard. When ready, Wallace joined the squadron which sailed from St Helens under Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot on 1 May 1779 and with him turned aside for the relief of Jersey, then threatened by a French force of five ships of the line under the prince of Nassau. Hearing that Nassau had been repulsed and that some frigates had been sent from Portsmouth, Arbuthnot pursued his voyage, leaving the <i>Experiment</i> to strengthen the force at Jersey. When Wallace was joined by Captain Gidoin, commanding the expected frigates, the two captains concerted an attack on the French squadron which had gone towards the mainland and was endeavouring to reach St Malo. Wallace, now benefiting from the tide, drove them into Cancale Bay, following them in, despite the refusal of the pilot to navigate the channels. He then succeeded in silencing a six-gun battery under which they had sheltered, and burnt two of the frigates and a small cutter that were fast on shore. The third frigate, the <i>Danae</i> (34 guns), and two smaller vessels were brought off and sent to England.<br>
<br>Wallace then rejoined Arbuthnot, who had been forced by foul winds to wait in Torbay, and sailed with him for New York. In September 1779 he was sent to the southward with a considerable sum of money for the payment of the troops in Georgia. On 24 September he fell in with a detachment of d'Estaing's fleet, and was captured after a spirited resistance. In the action Wallace lost his secret signal books to the enemy, making it necessary for Arbuthnot to issue a new set to the fleet. Wallace was exonerated at the court martial he faced on the loss of his ship and was given command of the <i>Nonsuch</i> (64 guns) in March 1780, a position he fulfilled &#145;<i>dress'd or rather undress'd</i> in a white Jacket, Night cap and Flannel Trowsers&#146;  (NMM, JOD/23). In July, cruising off the coast of France, Wallace captured the corvette <i>Hussard</i>, followed soon afterwards by the famous frigate <i>Belle Poule</i>, commanded by Raymond-Marie Kergariou de Coatl&egrave;s, the former captain of the <i>Danae</i>, who was killed in the engagement. In April 1781 the <i>Nonsuch</i> was with Admiral Darby's fleet at the relief of Gibraltar. Darby praised all the captains who &#145;had greatly exerted themselves in their attacks on the gunboats&#146; which had threatened the relief  (ADM 1/95). On the homeward voyage the <i>Nonsuch</i> was lookout vessel of the van squadron and chased and brought to action a French line-of-battle ship. According to Wallace the fight started at half past ten at night when he brought the <i>Nonsuch</i> alongside the Frenchman, exchanging broadsides and for a time being caught in her rigging. Wallace considered he had the best of the action when, about midnight, his opponent seized the chance to sail away. The <i>Nonsuch</i> continued to chase and the action was resumed at 5 a.m. and in the early light of dawn Wallace said she appeared to be an 80-gun ship and some &#145;who pretended to know say she is the <i>Languedoc</i>&#146;  (ADM 1/95, fol. 210). By half past six, with much damage and many casualties, Wallace thought it prudent to disengage and rejoined the fleet, the <i>Languedoc</i> pursuing her course to Brest. Darby ordered Wallace to make his own way back to Plymouth to send his sixty wounded men to hospital and to dock the <i>Nonsuch</i>.<br>
<br>In October Wallace was appointed to the <i>Warrior</i> (74 guns), which sailed for the West Indies in January 1782 with Sir George Rodney and took part in the battle of the Saints on 12 April 1782, sailing in Hood's rear division. He returned to England in 1783 and for the next seven years was on half pay. In the Spanish armament of 1790 he commanded the <i>Swiftsure</i> for a few months and, in 1793, the <i>Monarch</i>, in which he went to the West Indies, returning at the end of the year. On 12 April 1794 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white and appointed commander-in-chief at Newfoundland with his flag in the <i>Romney</i> (50 guns). He was further promoted rear-admiral of the red on 4 July 1794. The remainder of his squadron was composed of frigates and smaller vessels intended for the protection of trade from the enemy's privateers. Wallace was therefore unable to offer any serious resistance to a French squadron of seven ships of the line and three frigates commanded by Rear-Admiral Richery which came out to North America, having been freed from Cadiz (August 1796) by the Spanish declaration of war. The French were free to inflict considerable damage on the fishermen, plundering their huts, stages, and boats. Wallace was bitterly mortified; but the colonists and traders, realizing that he had done all that was possible under the circumstances, passed a vote of thanks to him. He returned to England early the next year and had no further service. He had been made a vice-admiral of the white on 1 June 1795, vice-admiral of the red on 14 February 1799, and finally admiral of the blue on 1 January 1801.<br>
<br>At the time of his death on 6 January 1803 Wallace was living at Hanworth in Middlesex  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1389), but he died, according to James Ralfe, in Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London. He left to his wife, Anne, the estates which had come to her from her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30035/', "Sir James Wright")</script>, a former governor of Georgia. After some other bequests Wallace left the remainder of his property and various moneys including prize money and arrears of pay equally to his wife and their daughter, Mary. The amount of his fortune is not clear from his will but it is evident that he died a wealthy man with estates in Middlesex and Huntingdon and cash bequests in excess of &pound;20,000.<br>
