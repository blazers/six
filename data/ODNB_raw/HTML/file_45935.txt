<span class="headword">Broome,  John Egerton <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1985), <span class="occ">naval officer and illustrator</span>, was born in Seattle, Washington, USA, on 23 February 1901, the younger child and only son of Louis Egerton Broome (1875&#150;1951), an explorer, and his wife, Clara Kathleen Lake (1863&#150;1948). His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3570/', "Sir Frederick Napier Broome (1842&#150;1896)")</script>. Broome's early years were spent in Alaska, Detroit, and Panama; he went to England in 1908 and was educated at Oakwood School, near Caterham, Surrey. It was decided that a career in the Royal Navy would be suitable for him and &#145;there were the inevitable exams, selection boards, and then waiting in endless suspense&#146;  (private information). Broome entered the Royal Naval College, Osborne, in September 1914 and was rushed through the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He left in August 1917 and was appointed a midshipman on the <i>Colossus</i>, commanded by Dudley Pound (later first sea lord). Broome watched the surrender of the German high seas fleet from the <i>Colossus's</i> foretop.<br>
<br>From 1918 to 1919 Broome was a midshipman on the destroyers <i>Vivacious</i> and <i>Malaya</i>. Promoted to the acting rank of sub-lieutenant, he served on the <i>Scimitar</i>, taking and passing the sub-lieutenants' exam and gaining a certificate 2 in seamanship. He served as a sub-lieutenant on the <i>Clematis</i> in 1920 and the <i>Courageous</i> in 1922. When he returned to England in October 1922 he entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he became art editor of the magazine <span class="italic">Granta</span>. Broome left Cambridge in 1923 and, holding the acting rank of lieutenant, was sent on a submarine course. From 1924 to 1937 he spent most of the time serving on and commanding submarines, apart from two brief periods: 1928&#150;9, when he served on the <i>Tiger</i>, and 1932&#150;4, when he served as a lieutenant-commander on the <i>Royal Oak</i>. In 1928 Broome married Sybil (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of Admiral Nicholas; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Between 1936 and 1938 Broome was an instructor at the RAF Staff College, at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and at Andover. At the outbreak of the Second World War he learned that at thirty-eight he was too old to continue serving in submarines. However, he recommissioned the destroyer <i>Veteran</i> and served in the western approaches, where he was involved in convoy work under the direction of Admiral Dunbar Naismith, commander-in-chief, western approaches. At the beginning of the Second World War Broome took part in the annual operations at Narvik, Norway, in 1940, and picked up survivors after the aircraft-carrier <i>Glorious</i> was sunk. Broome briefly served ashore under Admiral Sir Percy Noble. While working for Noble, Broome helped to implement a scheme whereby escort ships would be formed into reasonably well-balanced groups which trained and worked together under the same commander. Because of his age and experience Broome was appointed senior officer (O), with the <i>Victorious</i> serving as the &#145;father&#146; to miscellaneous escorts. In 1941 he was appointed air liaison officer at Liverpool and was promoted temporarily to captain (D) at the Liverpool base. He was appointed Escort Group 1 in the destroyer <i>Keppel</i> at Londonderry in September 1941.<br>
<br>In mid-June 1942 Broome was the senior escort commander for Convoy PQ17, which was composed of thirty-five merchant ships&#151;mainly American&#151;commanded by Commodore J. C. K. Dowding. This convoy sailed from Reykjav&iacute;k on 27 June 1942 bound for Archangel as Murmansk had been virtually destroyed by German bombing raids. The close escort force commanded by Broome in the <i>Keppel</i> joined the convoy three days later on 30 June. On 1 July the destroyers attacked U-boats sighted on the surface and on 4 July the convoy, about 130 miles north-east of Bear Island, was attacked about 7.30 p.m. by German aircraft, some of the bombs falling near the <i>Keppel</i> and the American cruiser <i>USS Wainwright</i>. Broome remarked that it was the <i>Wainwright's</i> &#145;Fourth of July enthusiasm&#146; as she sped round the convoy firing at the aircraft that was largely the reason the German attack failed  (TNA: PRO, ADM 234/369, p. 59). A further attack was launched an hour later and the leading aircraft hit the <i>Navarino</i> in the middle of the convoy with two torpedoes before crashing in flames just ahead of the <i>Keppel</i>. Two other ships were torpedoed, one of which was sunk while the other, a Russian tanker, Broome found &#145;holed but happy&#146;. Following this attack on the convoy Broome's impression on seeing the resolution displayed by the convoy with its escort was &#145;provided the ammunition lasted, PQ17 could get anywhere&#146;  (ibid., 60).<br>
<br>The Admiralty believed, however, that the <i>Tirpitz</i> and other warships were planning to attack the convoy. In the event this fear proved to be tragically unfounded. The first sea lord, Sir Dudley Pound, decided shortly after 9 p.m. that the cruisers must withdraw and the convoy scatter immediately. The decision was relayed to Rear-Admiral Hamilton, in charge of the cruiser force, at 10 p.m. The message was sent to Broome who expected to see the cruisers open fire as the enemy's masts appeared over the horizon. He decided therefore to take the escort destroyers to reinforce the cruisers and ordered the two submarines P165 and P168 to stay with the convoy and to try to attack the enemy while the rest of the escorts sailed independently to Archangel. At 10.15 p.m. on 4 July therefore Broome passed on the order for the convoy to scatter and with his destroyers sailed to join Hamilton. As the escorting destroyers parted Dowding signalled to Broome, &#145;Many thanks; goodbye and good hunting&#146;, to which Broome replied, &#145;It is a grim business leaving you here&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 234/369, pp. 63, 67). Broome later described his decision to leave the convoy as the hardest decision he had ever had to make, but in the circumstances it was clearly the right one and his action was later approved by the commander-in-chief, Sir John Tovey, and Rear-Admiral Hamilton. The convoy scattered as ordered, but on 5 July it was attacked by a German aircraft and submarines. Twelve of PQ17's ships were sunk. The attacks continued over the next three days and 23 merchant ships were sunk (10 bombed, 3 torpedoed by aircraft, and 10 by U-boats); only 11 merchant ships reached Russia. For his part in the action Broome was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross early in 1943.<br>
<br>Broome was appointed captain of the escort aircraft-carrier <i>Avalon</i> in 1942 and in April 1943 he was appointed captain of the <i>Begum</i> in which he served with the Eastern Fleet under Admiral Sir John Somerville. In February 1945 Broome was mentioned in dispatches, as the <i>Begum</i> had sunk a Japanese submarine; and in May he was appointed commandant of <i>HMS Vernon II</i>, the shore establishment at Portsmouth. Afterwards he was captain of the <i>Ramillies</i>.<br>
<br>In 1947 Broome retired from the navy and became editor-in-chief of <span class="italic">Sketch Magazine</span>, a position he held until 1952. In the 1950s he drew a set of drawings for the Royal Navy signal school which were based on the new NATO phonetic alphabet; and he also drew the &#145;crossing the line&#146; certificate presented to Princess Elizabeth when she crossed the equator in 1947. In 1969 Broome sued the author David Irving for libellous remarks he had made about him in <span class="italic">The Destruction of Convoy PQ17</span> and won the case. He was awarded &pound;40,000 in damages and half the costs. The libel law was changed as a result of the case. Broome was the author of five books, including <span class="italic">Make a Signal</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Make another Signal</span> (1973). He also illustrated a further six books between 1936 and 1971 including <span class="italic">Fabulous Admirals</span> by Geoffrey Lewis (1952). He was the naval adviser on several films including <span class="italic">The Cruel Sea</span> (1953) and, with Admiral Sir Roy Foster-Brown, wrote the scripts for the television series <span class="italic">The War at Sea</span> in 1959. He was one of the original members of the Lords Taverners.<br>
<br>Broome and his wife, Sybil, were divorced in 1954, and in the same year he married Joan Featherstonhaugh (<i>d</i>. 1996), the daughter of Bernard Crisp. They had no children. Broome moved to Nettlebed, near Henley-on-Thames, in 1960 and played an active part in village life. He died at his home, Gannock Cottage, Nettlebed, on 19 April 1985.<br>
