<span class="headword">Evans,  Evan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ieuan Fardd; <em>called </em>Ieuan Brydydd Hir]</span>  (1731&#150;1788), <span class="occ">scholar and poet</span>, was born on 20 May 1731 at Cynhawdref farm in the parish of Lledrod, Cardiganshire. The son of Jenkin Evans (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1758), a farmer, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1788), he sat at the feet of Edward Richard at his celebrated school in Ystradmeurig before entering Merton College, Oxford, in December 1750. He left without graduating, but by 1754 he was an ordained priest and he spent the following two decades wandering disconsolately from curacy to curacy. He served in at least eighteen different cures in England and Wales, and became an instantly recognized figure among his countrymen. He adopted the bardic name Ieuan Fardd (Ieuan the Poet), but since he was an extraordinarily tall and lean man his contemporaries normally referred to him as Ieuan Brydydd Hir (Ieuan the Tall Poet) or Longobardus.<br>
<br>For much of his life Evans was preoccupied by two issues of critical importance in eighteenth-century Wales. The first was the Anglicization of the established church in Wales, the direct result of the appointment of non-Welsh prelates. Evans despised the absentee &#145;Esgyb-Eingl&#146; (&#145;Anglo-bishops&#146;) who passed over deserving Welsh clergymen in favour of pliant, non-Welsh-speaking time-servers, and became convinced that ardent and outspoken Welsh patriots within the church would always be denied affluent and permanent preferments. As avenues of advancement were closed to him, he began to thunder and rage against his <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>, the Anglo-bishops and the place-hunters and sycophants who preached &#145;horrid unintelligible jargon&#146; in Welsh pulpits. In 1764&#150;5 he completed an unpublished polemic entitled &#145;The grievances of the principality of Wales in the church considered&#146;, the most sweeping indictment of the established church since the publication of Erasmus Saunders's tract on the diocese of St David's in 1721. Since the manuscript was riddled with barbed references to &#145;ravenous wolves&#146;, &#145;ignorant bunglers&#146;, and &#145;useless rogues&#146; who had turned the church into a &#145;house of Merchandise and a den of thieves&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 2009B), it is not surprising that the Society of Cymmrodorion was reluctant to publish it. Convinced that bishops looked upon him with &#145;an evil eye&#146;  (Owen, 2.620), however, Evans continued until his dying day to vent his spleen on arrogant English churchmen, tithe-grabbing landowners, and the new Methodist enthusiasts.<br>
<br>Evans's second preoccupation was the sorry plight of Welsh culture. At a time when Wales lacked major cultural institutions and libraries, he resolved to concentrate on fostering the cause of Welsh scholarship. Influenced by Edward Richard and Lewis Morris, he joined the Morris circle and spent his leisure hours seeking out and copying manuscripts of literary and historical interest. He tramped the length and breadth of Wales in search of unpublished manuscripts in private libraries, many of which had been subjected to the ravages of mildew, mice, rats, and rain. His manuscripts and books were so numerous that two men and horses were required to move his library in 1767. He established fruitful links with the poet Thomas Gray and the antiquary Thomas Percy, and his joy was boundless when he discovered valuable texts such as &#145;Y Gododdin&#146; and the work of Taliesin. His knowledge of the contents of Welsh manuscripts was second to none, and his major work, <span class="italic">Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Antient Welsh Bards</span> (1764), has been widely acclaimed as a seminal landmark in the history of Welsh scholarship. This was the first attempt to interpret the works of the Poets of the Princes and to chart the development of Welsh poetry from the sixth century to the Tudor period. It established Evans's reputation as the greatest Welsh scholar since Edward Lhuyd. Evans also composed <i>awdlau</i>, <i>cywyddau</i>, and <i>englynion</i>, mainly for the benefit of his patrons and companions, and his most celebrated poem is &#145;Llys Ifor Hael&#146; (&#145;The court of Ifor the Generous&#146;), a series of <i>englynion</i> lamenting the demise of the heroic poetic tradition which he composed in 1779 during a visit to the ruins of the court of Ifor Hael (Ifor ap Llywelyn) at Gwernyclepa, near Basaleg, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>Increasingly, however, Evans became a misanthropic, disorganized, and dishevelled figure, given to fits of melancholic depression which he sought (unsuccessfully) to relieve by imbibing prodigious quantities of alcohol. During the 1770s the second Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1749&#150;1789) took pity on him and gave him a modest pension and access to the literary treasures at the Wynnstay library. But Evans remained at odds with himself and the world around him. His writings became passionately patriotic and Anglophobe, and in the preface to a collection of translated sermons in 1776 he berated the likes of Williams Wynn for &#145;wearing the badge of their vassalage, by adopting the language of their conquerors, which is a mark of the most despicable meanness of spirit&#146;  (E. Evans, <span class="italic">Casgliad o bregethau</span>, 1, 1776, sig. B3). Similarly, in his best-known English poem&#151;<span class="italic">The Love of our Country</span>, published in 1772&#151;he depicted Owain Glynd&#373;r as a popular hero rather than as a bandit rebel in order to instil into his fellow countrymen greater pride in their national heritage.<br>
<br>During the latter years of Evans's life Paul Panton and Thomas Pennant sought to relieve his penury by inviting subscriptions from well-wishers on his behalf, and in 1787 Panton also purchased his remarkable collection of manuscripts, much of which entered the public domain when <span class="italic">The Myvyrian Archaiology</span> was published in three volumes between 1801 and 1807. Although Evans's burning patriotism and hard-hitting criticisms did not endear him to the establishment in Wales, he was highly regarded as a scholar. Unmarried and virtually penniless, he died on 4 August 1788 in the remote farmhouse where he had been born, and was buried in Lledrod churchyard. Such a gifted man deserved a better fate than a life of penury and neglect.<br>
