<span class="headword">Mullock,  Richard</span>  (1851&#150;1920), <span class="occ">sports administrator</span>, was born on 31 May 1851 in Newport, Monmouthshire, the eldest of the four children of Henry Mullock (1826&#150;1914), a local commercial printer, and his wife, Henrietta (1819&#150;1896). The Mullock family played a prominent role in the municipal, commercial, philanthropic, and artistic life of nineteenth-century Newport. Richard Mullock, who entered into partnership with his father in 1877, invested his own energies outside the daily routine of the family printing business in the organization of local and national sport.<br>
<br>Mullock helped bring the Newport athletic club into existence in 1874, when he handed over a &pound;100 profit from an athletics meeting he had arranged to the secretary of the town cricket club, Edward Bellerby. The two men occupied the joint secretaryship until 1883. Mullock's administrative skills were also in evidence as secretary of the Newport Infirmary from 1877 to 1884, but it was as an energetic promoter of the emerging game of rugby football that he became most widely known. He arranged the first erratically flickering &#145;electric light&#146; match seen in Wales, when Newport played against Cardiff at Rodney Parade on 16 October 1878, and then pulled off another coup by inviting the crack English side Blackheath to play their first ever fixture in Wales, against Newport on 20 November 1879. The subsequent drubbing by the &#145;heathens&#146; of the leading Welsh side of the time convinced Mullock that rugby in Wales would improve only if it were taken out of the unambitious hands of its Neath-based organizing body, the South Wales Football Union. On his own initiative he met with other Welsh club representatives at Swansea in March 1880 and then proceeded to open independent negotiations with the Rugby Football Union in London, who on 30 November 1880 considered &#145;a letter from Mr. R. Mullock of Newport, Monmouthshire, proposing a match with Wales&#146;. Drawing on a wide range of personal, club, and college contacts Mullock hurried to assemble a side that played the full English fifteen at Blackheath on 19 February 1881.<br>
<br>Although Mullock's scratch team was heavily defeated, the momentum generated by his bold move proved unstoppable. With characteristic bravado, and to the chagrin of official Welsh rugby circles, he summoned representatives of eleven clubs to the Castle Hotel, Neath, on 12 March 1881, and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) came into existence. Mullock, who had precipitated its birth, was elected both secretary and treasurer, and the retrospective award of caps to the fifteen who had played at Blackheath gave official recognition to Wales's first international team. For the next decade the purposeful Mullock, portly in appearance and brusque in manner, ran the fledgeling union's affairs until his perceived high-handedness and casual approach to financial matters provoked his downfall. Having narrowly survived a bid to unseat him at the WRU's annual meeting in 1886, he obtained a stay of execution in 1887, when he was able to report the union's first credit balance, and for the next two years he was one of Wales's three nominees on the International Rugby Board (founded in 1886). But whereas in the WRU's early years Mullock had met some of its expenses from his own pocket, by 1890 he was rumoured to be guilty of financial impropriety, and the following year he was forced to relinquish the treasurership. He remained as honorary secretary, but only for one more year: at the WRU's annual general meeting on 10 September 1892 he was awarded a testimonial of 100 guineas and the decision was taken to appoint a paid secretary.<br>
<br>Had Mullock enjoyed the annual stipend of &pound;50 voted to his successor, W. H. Gwynn of Swansea, by the WRU he might have been saved from his subsequent financial difficulties. In April 1893 he was declared a bankrupt, although he continued in the family firm, which in 1897 bound the testimonial book for A. J. Gould, illuminated by Mullock himself. His considerable artistic talent won him high praise as curator of the fine art section of the Royal National Eisteddfod held in Newport in 1897, and he was renowned as a skilled copyist of engravings. When in 1902 he was sued in court for &pound;3 of goods he pleaded that the &pound;1 a month he earned from selling drawings was insufficient to support his wife, Emily (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips), whom he had married in March 1874, and their six children. He left the Newport area and disappeared from public view. The family's artistic streak was inherited by his daughter Dorothy Mullock, whose stylish illustrations for two plays by Clifford Bax, <span class="italic">The Rose and the Cross</span> (1918) and <span class="italic">Prelude and Fugue</span> (1923), indicate her currency in fashionable London circles of the time.<br>
<br>Richard Mullock died in St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 8 July 1920, after an operation for throat cancer. By then he was living and working as a printer's clerk in Chiswick, in an elusive obscurity far removed from the publicity that had surrounded him as the founding father of the Welsh Rugby Union.<br>
