<span class="headword">Siebe,  (Christian) Augustus</span>  (1788&#150;1872), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born in Saxony, southern Prussia; the details of his parentage and place of birth are unknown. During the 1790s Augustus, as he was called throughout his life, moved with his family to Berlin, where he showed an aptitude for mechanical and handicraft skills. After leaving school he was apprenticed to a master caster in the capital and soon won medals at fourteen or fifteen for his work in modelling, chasing, and watchmaking.<br>
<br>At twenty-four, according to his own account, Siebe served as an officer of artillery in the Prussian army and was wounded in the battle of the Nations at Leipzig in 1813. After leaving the army at the end of the Napoleonic wars he went first to Denmark and then to England to find employment. He worked for a time with Garrards of London, the royal jewellers, and then as an instrument maker. After a brief period as a manager for an engineering firm he decided to set up for himself as a watchmaker and silversmith at 145 High Holborn.<br>
<br>After some success in mechanical inventions and in business, Siebe moved in 1829 to larger premises nearby&#151;at 5 Denmark Street, Soho. This substantial terraced house gave the Siebe family domestic accommodation as well as workshop space and a shopfront from where he could sell his many mechanical products. Among these were a rotary water pump, which was a great financial success, and the world's first dial weighing machine, which reputedly weighed and measured new recruits for the Crimean War. Siebe later manufactured under licence the Australian James Harrison's ice-making machine, which worked on the ether principle. In 1823 he won the Vulcan medal from the Royal Society of Arts for an improved screw threading tool.<br>
<br>Siebe's major claim to fame, however, was to improve and develop an invention not his own. In 1827 he met Charles Anthony Deane, who in 1823 had invented a smoke helmet for use in firefighting. Deane commissioned Siebe to make up a few sets, and the design was very soon adapted for use as a diving helmet, developed in conjunction with Charles Deane's younger brother John. Before this, the centuries-old diving bell, a cumbersome and unwieldy tool, had been used for shipwreck salvage and other underwater work. The naval establishment and the wider maritime economy were ready for something better. The Deanes and Siebe provided the answer. In 1830 they collaborated in producing a complete diving apparatus kit, which consisted of a beaten copper helmet with windows fixed to a corselet. This metalwork was worn over an all-enveloping india-rubber suit, with chest weights and heavy boots. The helmet was supplied with air through a hose connected to a pump operated from above; the exhaled air bubbled out from the rim of the corselet and was known as the &#145;open helmet&#146;. The &#145;closed helmet&#146; incorporated a loose flange sealing the dress to the helmet around the edge of the corselet, a modification devised and given freely to Siebe by George Edwards, the engineer in charge of Lowestoft harbour in 1840. These suits gradually proved themselves over the next ten years or so, until in 1840 Siebe supplied a few suits to Colonel Pasley of the Royal Engineers, then engaged in removing the wreck of the <i>Royal George</i>, lost some fifty years before in the main anchorage of Portsmouth harbour. This government recognition firmly established &#145;Siebe's patent diving dress&#146; as the accepted replacement for the outmoded bell system, despite Siebe's having no patent and being essentially a manufacturer and promoter. The apparatus was, however, greatly improved by the provision of a two- or three-cylinder pump of his own manufacture. The use of these instead of a bellows pump enabled air to be forced down to much greater depths.<br>
<br>The invention was much copied in the United Kingdom and in other countries and remained in its use until the SCUBA-type equipment replaced it in the 1950s. Until the 1970s Siebe &amp; Co. and the successor firm of Siebe Gorman &amp; Co. published several manuals and other related books that became standard works in the industry. The company stayed in business until the 1990s, when the expanded nature of its business and a change of name effectively subsumed it.<br>
<br>Augustus Siebe married Susannah Glidden (1796&#150;1856) of Sherwell, Devon, at St Anne's Church, Soho, on 11 July 1819. They had six children of whom his second son, Henry Herepath, together with his son-in-law William Gorman, succeeded him in business on his retirement in 1868.<br>
<br>Siebe died at his home in Denmark Street on 15 April 1872 and was buried in Norwood cemetery, London. The Institution of Civil Engineers described him in their <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> as &#145;retiring, kind of heart, and upright and honourable in his dealings&#146;  (vol. 36, 1873). Although not the originator of either the closed or open diving helmet dress, Siebe certainly prompted its eventual improvement and development. One of the best and most imaginative machinists of his time, he took the novel but sometimes crude ideas of others and combined them in an improved form to produce what became known throughout the world as &#145;the standard diving dress&#146;. Old Siebe helmet dresses can still be found in many countries and are a monument to his effort and genius.<br>
