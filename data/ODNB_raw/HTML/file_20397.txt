<span class="headword">Nugent,  Richard</span>, first earl of Westmeath  (1583&#150;1642), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest of six sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20387/', "Christopher Nugent, fifth Baron Delvin (1544&#150;1602)")</script>, and Lady Mary or Marie (<i>d</i>. 1610/11), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eleventh earl of Kildare")</script>, and succeeded to his father's title, aged nineteen, in October 1602. He was knighted at Dublin Castle on 29 December 1603, and in or before 1604 married Jane, daughter of Christopher Plunkett, Lord Killeen, and Genet Dillon. They had five sons, of whom the eldest, Christopher, was born in 1604, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Delvin was implicated in the conspiracy which was uncovered after the &#145;flight of the earls&#146; in 1607, having promised Rory O'Donnell, earl of Tyrconnell, that he would help to seize Dublin Castle if Spanish military aid was forthcoming. The main reason for his plotting seems to have been that the government forced him to surrender title to certain lands in Longford. He was imprisoned in Dublin Castle in November 1607 but escaped and fled to co. Cavan. From there he wrote to Lord Deputy Chichester (himself accused of abetting the escape) asking pardon for his inchoate plotting and pleading youth and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> as an excuse. Unable to capture him, and fearful of the return of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell with outside military assistance, Chichester promised him a pardon if he submitted. He did so in May 1608, and then went to court where his conduct was forgiven and he was granted lands in recompense for those he had surrendered by royal command.<br>
<br>Delvin again incurred the displeasure of the government in 1613. &#145;Unmindful of his majesty's great favour to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Carew Manuscripts</span>, 1603&#150;23, 275), he participated in Catholic protests against the creation of new boroughs to secure a protestant majority in the new parliament. In 1620 he was one of three Irish representatives who had some success in petitioning James I with, the latter noted approvingly, &#145;much modesty, humility and discretion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1614&#150;25</i>, 282) against new alehouse licensing arrangements. Evidently Delvin regained royal favour since he was created earl of Westmeath on 4 September 1621. His attempt, from December 1623 to April 1624, to mobilize opposition to a proposed plantation in Ossory aroused the hostility of Lord Deputy Falkland, who was particularly stung by Westmeath's prescient claim that this was a prelude to a larger plantation in Connaught. It is unlikely to be coincidence that informers now emerged to allege, variously, that Westmeath claimed to be king of Ireland, that he was in correspondence with Spain, and that he would be the next lord deputy. Embarrassed by the allegations, the earl was required to satisfy himself with &#145;private exercise of his conscience&#146;, not to &#145;set himself up hereafter in the conceit of the multitude&#146;  (ibid., 488) and to go to London to clear his name.<br>
<br>War with Spain in 1625, and later with France, and the threat of invasion created the apparent opportunity for Irish Catholics to extract concessions from the crown. Following the refusal of the government to entrust defence to local trained bands in 1626, Westmeath played a leading role in attempts to secure guarantees of religious toleration in return for subsidizing an expanded standing army. Arriving in London in March 1626, he and Sir John Bath presented Catholic grievances to Charles I. They secured what seemed to be significant concessions with the enumeration of &#145;matters of grace and bounty&#146; including the promise to replace the oath of supremacy with an oath of allegiance as a qualification for formal inheritance of estates, office-holding, and the practice of law. The Catholic leadership as a whole, however, did not consider the concessions adequate, and in May 1627 Westmeath was sent again to England, where he persuaded Charles I to agree to discuss the wider ramifications of his policy with a full delegation. He took part in another delegation, in 1628, which secured additional concessions including, crucially, the promise to renounce crown titles to land of more than sixty years' standing. Ultimately, however, these latter &#145;graces&#146; were withheld and a period of repression followed.<br>
<br>In 1632 Westmeath lobbied successfully to be chosen to go to England to present a statement of Catholic grievances to Wentworth, the newly appointed lord deputy. He was granted a royal audience and returned despite the efforts of the administration in Dublin to have him detained in London, citing as their reason that he was &#145;a vehement papist and of a popular carriage among the Irish &hellip; none of that religion appears in more eminency upon all occasions for the papists&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1625&#150;32</i>, 689). Wentworth's subsequent denial of the promised &#145;graces&#146; and the impotence of parliamentary opposition were among the longer-term factors which alienated the Old English and precipitated their involvement in the 1641 rising. It also marked the end of Westmeath's political activism.<br>
<br>Westmeath held back from personal involvement in the rising despite the pleas of the Catholic lords of the pale that he raise 1000 men to reinforce their siege of Drogheda. While one of his sons armed many of the household servants and brought them to the siege with &#145;the said Earl's privity&#146;  (TCD, MS 820, fol. 65), that was the extent of Westmeath's involvement. In June 1642 Ormond, the commander of the king's army, rested his army for a few days at the earl's castle at Clonyn while marching reinforcements to relieve Athlone. While Ormond was there Westmeath pleaded unsuccessfully with him for the life of an elderly Catholic priest taken in a clash with insurgent troops. This expedition proved to be the high-water mark of the government's counter-attack and Westmeath's co-operation with Ormond now exposed him to revenge attacks. Shortly afterwards insurgent cavalry intercepted him while fleeing to the nearest government garrison at Trim, dragged him out of his coach, and shot him in the thigh. He died of his wounds and subsequent manhandling, apparently some time in the summer of 1642, and was probably buried at Clonyn. His will, dated 2 October 1640, was proved by his widow, Countess Jane, on 12 February 1643. Christopher Nugent, Lord Delvin, their eldest son and heir, having died in 1625, their grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20398/', "Richard Nugent")</script> succeeded to the earldom.<br>
