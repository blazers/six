<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  William</span>  (1814&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Killaloe</span>, was a son of Maurice Fitzgerald MD and his second wife, Mary, daughter of Edward William Burton of Clifden, co. Galway. He was born at Lifford, co. Limerick, on 3 December 1814 and was the younger brother of Francis Alexander Fitzgerald, third baron of the exchequer. He was educated privately and then attended Midleton School, co. Cork. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in November 1830, obtained a scholarship in 1833, the primate's Hebrew prize in 1834, and the Downes premium for composition in 1835 and 1837. He took his degree of BA in 1835, his MA in 1848, and his BD and DD in 1853. He was ordained deacon at Elphin on 25 April 1838, and priest on 23 August 1847.<br>
<br>While serving as curate of Lackagh, Kildare, Fitzgerald made his first attempt to publish. Philip Bury Duncan of New College, Oxford, had offered a sum of &pound;50 for an essay entitled &#145;Logomachy, or, The abuse of words&#146;. Fitzgerald won the prize with the special commendation of the donor and an additional grant of &pound;25 to pay for the printing of the essay. After serving as curate of Clontarf, Dublin, from 1846 to 1848, he became vicar and prebend of Donaghmore, in the diocese of Dublin, on 16 February 1848.<br>
<br>From 1847 to 1852 Fitzgerald was professor of moral philosophy in Trinity College, Dublin, and from 1852 to 1857 was professor of ecclesiastical history in the same university. His next promotion was to the vicarage of St Anne's, Dublin, on 18 July 1851 and he also became private chaplain to Archbishop Richard Whately. In 1855 he moved to the perpetual curacy of Monkstown, Dublin, and was also appointed prebendary of Timothan, Dublin, and archdeacon of Kildare. On 8 March 1857 he was consecrated bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, and in 1862 was moved to Killaloe by letters patent dated 3 February. After disestablishment he was one of the most influential and persuasive speakers in the general synod. His moderate, broad-church views helped to settle the controversy over the revision of the prayer book between 1874 and 1877. He published many works both under his own name and anonymously, and was the chief contributor to the series of papers called <span class="roman">The Cautions for the Times</span>, which was edited by Archbishop Whately in 1853. His edition of Joseph Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy of Religion</span> was much praised by contemporaries; according to the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> of 1857 it was learned, without pedantry, and its depth of judgement superseded all earlier editions. His other published works include many sermons and charges, often addressing controversial topics. He was the author of <span class="italic">Episcopacy, Tradition and the Sacraments Considered in Reference to the Oxford Tracts</span> (1839), <span class="italic">The Connection of Morality with Religion</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Thoughts on Present Circumstances of the Church of Ireland</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">The Athanasian Creed, a Letter to the Dioceses of Killaloe and Kilfenora, Clonfert, and Kilmacduagh</span> (1875).<br>
<br>In 1840 Fitzgerald married Anne, the elder daughter of George Stoney of Oakley Park, Queen's county. They had six children: three sons, including the physicist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33151/', "George Francis FitzGerald")</script>, and three daughters. Anne died on 20 October 1859, aged thirty-six, and was buried in Cork Cathedral. Fitzgerald died at Clarisford House, Killaloe, Clare, on 24 November 1883 and was buried in the family vault at St Nicholas's Church, Cork, on 28 November.<br>
