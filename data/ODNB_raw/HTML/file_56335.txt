<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Terence Ian Fitton</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Gawsworth]</span>  (1912&#150;1970), <span class="occ">poet and journal editor</span>, was born at 97 Gunterstone Road, Kensington, London, on 29 June 1912, the younger of the two children of Frederic Percy Armstrong (1877&#150;1943), colonial broker, and his wife, Ethel Laura Jackson (1878&#150;1947). The Armstrongs were of lowland Scottish descent, and through his father's line Terence Ian Fitton Armstrong claimed both Ben Jonson and Lionel Johnson as ancestors. His early choice of John Gawsworth as a pen name reflected the Jacobite link he claimed, through his mother, with Mary Fitton, supposedly Shakespeare's Dark Lady, who was born in the family home of Gawsworth, Cheshire.<br>
<br>Of few writers has it been more true to say that they peaked too soon. Educated at Manor House School, Horsham, Sussex, and at Linton House and Merchant Taylors' schools, London, Gawsworth's adolescent passion for books and manuscripts was fanned by employment from 1928 in Andrew Block's bookshop, a stone's throw from Foyle's. Before he was twenty his published poetry was being praised, and he had acquired a wide knowledge of post-1890 literature. On 27 March 1933 he married Barbara Kentish (1907&#150;1972), who divorced him in 1948. By 1935 he was a freeman of the City of London, and in 1938 a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (Benson medallist, 1939). By 1937 he had been recognized as the originator, coordinator, and leader of the neo-Georgian movement, and was founder editor of the <span class="italic">English Digest</span>, from 1939 to 1941. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1941, serving on Algerian, Tunisian, Sicilian, and Italian campaigns, and in India, in 1942&#150;5. D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des &Eacute;crivains de l'Afrique du Nord, Tunis, in 1943, he was elected to the Salamander Society of Poets, Cairo, in 1944.<br>
<br>Leaving the RAF with flying officer rank in 1946, unscathed by either shot or shell, Gawsworth found post-war England a more testing challenge. Fourteen years had passed since Ernest Benn, by whom he had been employed, had published his <span class="italic">Ten Contemporaries</span> in 1932. In that same year had come his study of Wyndham Lewis, <span class="italic">Apes, Japes and Hitlerism</span>, and <span class="italic">Lyrics to Kingcup</span>, the latter prompting John Masefield's view that Gawsworth was &#145;one of the most beautiful and promising of our younger writers&#146;. <span class="italic">Poems, 1930&#150;1932</span> followed in 1933, and (with much in between) <span class="italic">New Poems</span> from Martin Secker in 1939. Throughout the thirties Gawsworth had made many friendships with writers mostly older than himself, including Arthur Machen, M. P. Shiel, and Eden Phillpotts.<br>
<br>Younger post-war modernists, however, remembered the presumption of a 21-year-old traditionalist poet's retrospective selection, and the publication by Sidgwick and Jackson in 1948 of <span class="italic">The Collected Poems of John Gawsworth</span> was for some the final straw. The often unattractive evidence of Gawsworth's increasing reliance on alcohol&#151;exacerbated by his growing fear of failing creativity&#151;put a convenient rod in his critics' hands. His second marriage, to Estelle Hayward, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gilardeau (<i>b</i>. 1909/10), on 6 August 1948, foundered, and many friendships were over-tested. His 1949&#150;52 editorship of the <span class="italic">Poetry Review</span> was revoked, despite protests from Edith Sitwell and others, and his intriguing role as &#145;king&#146; of the romantic Caribbean island of Redonda, inherited from the novelist M. P. Shiel (1865&#150;1947), had declined by the early 1950s from being a pleasant literary legend to providing a happy hunting ground for tabloid journalists and publicans eager to receive a dukedom in exchange for a wiped slate. Earlier recipients of titles, approved by M. P. Shiel's watchful and stringent bibliographer the Grand Duke A. Reynolds Morse, included Lawrence and Gerald Durrell, Rebecca West, J. B. Priestley, Dorothy Sayers, Frank Swinnerton, Victor Gollancz, John Heath-Stubbs, Alfred Knopf, Stephen Potter, Ellery Queen, Arthur Machen, Roy Campbell, Dylan Thomas, and (Robert) Fabian of the Yard. On 21 June 1958 Gawsworth offered in <span class="italic">The Times</span> his &#145;Caribbean kingship with royal prerogatives, 1000 guineas&#146;, receiving many responses including a &pound;50 option payment from the Swedish Count Bertil Bernadotte, who lost his deposit, the offer being withdrawn.<br>
<br>Gawsworth deserves to be remembered for some good lyric poems, for his editing of some sixty verse collections and volumes of prose, and for a bibliographic talent that led Lawrence Durrell to write that &#145;had he cared to be a bookseller he would now be the greatest one in England&#146;  (Durrell, 17). Though his posturing and addiction did not compensate for a lack of &#145;centre&#146;, many such have been more generously recognized for their abilities. To his credit was an undoubted poetic sensibility, early proof of unusual talent, a deep loyalty to literature, and much kindness to elderly writers and their needy dependants, for whom he lobbied the Royal Literary Fund tirelessly and with frequent success.<br>
<br>Gawsworth's third marriage on 29 October 1955 to a widow, Doreen Emily Ada (Anna) Downie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rowley (1906/7&#150;1980), was not dissolved, but despite her efforts and those of his remaining friends, his final years were spent in poverty, self-neglect, and squalor. He died on 23 September 1970 in the Brompton Hospital, London, his ashes joining his father's a week later at the Golders Green crematorium. His last poetry selection, <span class="italic">Toreros</span>, drawn from his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> by Richard Aldington in 1961, failed to appear until its posthumous edition of 1990; a biography of Arthur Machen, written in the 1930s, was published in 2005.<br>
