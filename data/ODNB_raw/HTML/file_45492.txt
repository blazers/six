<span class="headword">Rae <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Normand]</span>,  Henrietta Emma Ratcliffe</span>  (1856&#150;1928), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 1 Grove Villas, The Grove, Hammersmith, London, on 30 December 1856, the youngest daughter of Thomas Burbey Rae, clerk of the local board of guardians, and his wife, Anne Eliza Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graves, a gifted amateur musician. Though her mother wished her to make a career in music, she eventually began to train in art at the Female School of Art, Bloomsbury, independently at the British Museum, and in the evenings at Heatherley's School of Art. In 1877 she gained access at her sixth attempt to the Royal Academy Schools, where she studied until 1884.<br>
<br>Henrietta Rae exhibited widely in London and the provinces from 1879, making her d&eacute;but at the Royal Academy in 1881 with <span class="italic">Miss Warman</span>, a portrait. Her 1884 exhibit, <span class="italic">Lancelot and Elaine</span>, marked her intention to become identified as a painter of the highest genre, which included literary and mythological subjects, and the following year <span class="italic">Ariadne Deserted by Theseus</span> and <span class="italic">A Bacchante</span> (Christopher Wood Gallery, London) signalled her commitment to the classical revival promoted by the Royal Academy as the path to high art. This became viable for female artists at this time because the artistic training accessible to them began to compare with that available to men. She became the first female artist in Britain since Angelica Kauffmann to establish herself at this level of the hierarchy of genres. In this ambition she was much influenced by her friendship with the leading artist and best-known neo-classicist of the day, Frederic (later Lord) Leighton, whom she freely acknowledged as her mentor, though she was never his student. On 26 May 1884 Rae married in Croydon fellow artist Ernest (1857&#150;1923), son of George Barten Normand. She had met him while a student at the Royal Academy and they went to live near Leighton in the newly fashionable district of Kensington which became something of an artistic colony from the 1880s. They had a son in 1886 and a daughter in 1893.<br>
<br>Seeking to develop her work, Rae and her husband went to Paris in 1890, studying at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian and in Brittany. This experience gave her work a new painterliness, to be seen in <span class="italic">La cigale</span> which she showed at the Royal Academy in 1891. In 1894 she exhibited a large multi-figure composition, <span class="italic">Psyche before the Throne of Venus</span>, which the artist intended as her <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>: though attracting much attention, and finding a purchaser in the important collector of contemporary art George McCulloch, it was deprecated by critics who found it too &#145;feminine&#146; to be sufficiently grand. This was a major disappointment for her and thenceforward she seems to have accepted that prejudice against women's artistic ambitions would dog her efforts and always limit her successes. She continued, however, in the same vein of subjects and style, with such works as <span class="italic">Apollo and Daphne</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Isabella</span> (1896) (ex Sothebys), and <span class="italic">Diana and Callisto</span> (1899). Interleaving these ambitious canvases with the more commercially reliable genre of portraiture, she continued to appear regularly at the Royal Academy exhibitions until 1919. Despite the advent of modernism she did not abandon her production of classical stories presented in narrative fashion&#151;for example, <span class="italic">Hylas and the Nymphs</span> (1910; priv. coll.)&#151;and symbolic nude female figures&#151;as in <span class="italic">Songs of the Morning</span> (1904; priv. coll.)&#151;which still found a ready audience in the gallery-goers and collectors of her own generation.<br>
<br>Rae gained an honourable mention at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1889 and a medal at the world fair in Chicago in 1893. Her painting <span class="italic">Ophelia</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) was purchased by the Liverpool corporation in 1890 and she was the first woman to serve on the hanging committee of that city's important autumn exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in 1893. She was one of the artists commissioned to produce frescoes for the Royal Exchange, London, completed in 1900, and was included in the Victorian Exhibition mounted at Earls Court, London, in 1897 to represent the art of the queen's reign, serving as president of the women's art section. She died on 26 March 1928 at her home, St Egberts, 4 Fox Hill Gardens, Upper Norwood, Surrey.<br>
