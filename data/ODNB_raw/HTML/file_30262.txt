<span class="headword">Young,  George</span>  (1777&#150;1848), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and geologist</span>, was born on 15 July 1777 at a small farmhouse called Croxiedean in the parish of Kirknewton and East Calder, Edinburghshire, and baptized in that parish on 3 August, the son of John Young and his wife, Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graham. Having studied under John Playfair at the University of Edinburgh, he graduated with high honours in 1796 and commenced his training in theology with George Lawson at Selkirk. In 1801 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Edinburgh of the associate secession church, and in the summer of 1805 visited Whitby, with which he was to be associated for the rest of his life. In January 1806 he was ordained pastor of the Presbyterian congregation which met at the chapel there in Cliff Lane. He published some sermons, but his earliest substantial work was a defence of evangelical principles against Unitarianism, which was published in 1812, and this was followed five years later by his <span class="italic">History of Whitby and Streoneshalh Abbey</span>, a topographical and antiquarian account which was a continuation of the work of two other local antiquaries, Francis Gibson FSA and Richard Winter. In addition to providing a historical narrative, Young's account placed the town in its contemporary local context by incorporating statistical information on the demographic, economic, and geographical features of the neighbourhood. In 1819 he graduated MA at Edinburgh University, and in 1824 he produced a more popular topographical guide to his adopted town and its region, <span class="italic">A Picture of Whitby and its Environs</span>, which was reprinted in 1840, and later used by Elizabeth Gaskell as a background source for <span class="italic">Sylvia's Lovers</span>.<br>
<br>By this time Young had already turned his attention to geology, publishing in 1822 a comprehensive <span class="italic">Geological survey of the Yorkshire coast: describing the strata and fossils occurring between the Humber and the Tees, from the German ocean to the plain of York</span>, which was copiously illustrated by John Bird. His geological work was committed to &#145;honour that infinite being whose works are here examined and described&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geological Survey</span>, 12), and he accepted the biblical account of the creation and the flood, concluding that his findings did &#145;not contradict but confirm the sacred scripture&#146;  (ibid., 324). He returned to this theme in lectures given to the geological section of the British Association at its meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne, which were published in 1838 as <span class="italic">Scriptural Geology</span>. In this book he attacked the theories of Lyell and the pre-Adamites, claiming that the strata did not define periodic levels but were the result of natural upheavals caused by the flood. He was moved to publish a second edition in 1840 to counter the scriptural justification circulating in scientific clerical circles that the biblical flood was confined, as was man, to the Near East and central Asia, thereby allowing for older geological forms in other regions of the earth.<br>
<br>Young's connection to Whitby also engaged his interest in Captain Cook and the voyages of discovery, and in 1836 he published a selection from Cook's journals and other original sources, which proved popular with readers. He was an honorary member of the Hull and Yorkshire literary and philosophical societies, was active in public life in Whitby, and was a corresponding member of the Wernerian Natural History Society, Edinburgh. He had acquired a DD by 1840, but the award of that degree has not been traced. He married Margaret Hunter of Whitby on 11 April 1826 and died there on 8 May 1848, his wife having predeceased him. His will was proved in August 1848, when his goods, valued at &pound;800, were distributed among his many nieces and nephews, among whom was William Young, the Independent minister at Beverley.<br>
