<span class="headword">Cooke,  William</span>  (1711&#150;1797), <span class="occ">college head</span> and dean of Ely, was born in St James's, Westminster, on 15 October 1711, the son of William Cooke. He was sent to Harrow School in 1718, and placed upon the foundation at Eton College in 1721. In 1731 he matriculated as a scholar from King's College, Cambridge, and became a fellow in 1734. He graduated BA in 1735, and soon afterwards became an assistant master at Eton. In May 1743 he was unanimously elected headmaster, but he found his health too weak for the place, and in 1745 took the college living of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset. On 28 January 1746 he married Catherine, daughter of Richard Sleech, canon of Windsor.<br>
<br>In 1748 Cooke was elected a fellow of Eton College, and resigned Sturminster on being presented to the rectory of Denham, Buckinghamshire; he was also bursar of Eton. In 1765 he proceeded DD, and was appointed chaplain to the earl of Halifax. In 1768 he accepted the rectory of Stoke Newington. On 25 March 1772 he was unanimously elected provost of King's College, Cambridge. He was vice-chancellor of the university in 1772&#150;3. The antiquary William Cole had a low opinion of Cooke's abilities and claimed that Eton had been glad to lose him, but Cooke doubtless had provoked Cole's scorn by raising the rent of his cottage at Milton. In April 1780 he received a prebend in Ely, and on 9 August 1780 was appointed to the deanery.<br>
<br>Cooke published a few sermons, in one of which (1750) he provoked a slight controversy by defending Thomas Sherlock against Conyers Middleton in his interpretation of &#145;a more sure word of prophecy&#146; in the second epistle of <span class="roman">Peter</span>. Cooke also published anonymously a small collection of poems entitled <span class="italic">Musae juveniles</span> (1732). He died at Bath on 20 October 1797.<br>
<br>Of Cooke's twelve children, Catherine married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12016/', "Bishop Samuel Hallifax (1733&#150;1790)")</script>, and one of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6159/', "Edward Cooke (bap. 1755, d. 1820)")</script>, became secretary at war in Ireland. Another son, <a name="cosubject_6189"></a><span class="headword">William Cooke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1749, <em>d.</em> 1824), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was baptized at Eton on 8 May 1749. He matriculated from King's College, Cambridge, in 1765 and graduated BA in 1770. A fellow of his college from 1768 to 1786, he was regius professor of Greek in the university from 1780 to 1792. He published an edition of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Poetics</span> in 1785, to which was appended the first translation of Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy</span> into Greek verse. Ordained deacon on 1 September 1779 and priest on 23 June 1785, he was appointed rector of Hampstead-with-Hessingham in Norfolk in 1785. He published a few sermons, two of which examined the nature of moral liberty and civil liberty. His principal work was <span class="italic">The Revelations Translated, and Explained throughout</span> (1789), in which he compared <span class="roman">Revelation</span> to Sophocles' <span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span> and to Homer. He soon afterwards became mentally deranged and died on 3 May 1824.<br>
