<span class="headword">Blair,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>David Butterfield]</span>  (1932&#150;1976), <span class="occ">ballet dancer</span>, was born David Butterfield on 27 July 1932 at the Royal Halifax Infirmary, Halifax, Yorkshire, the elder child and only son of John Butterfield, moquette weaver, and his wife, Zett&eacute; Carolyne Elizabeth Whiteley, both of Halifax, where he received his primary education at Trinity School. As a child he attended local dancing classes and was selected by the Royal Academy of Dancing for extra coaching under its scholarship scheme in the Yorkshire region, which led, when he was fourteen, to the Royal Ballet School, London. Only a year later, in 1947, he joined the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet and progressed so quickly that at sixteen he was dancing the exacting <i>pas de deux</i> in <span class="italic">Casse noisette</span> and in 1950 he was made a principal dancer.<br>
<br>From the start Blair's exceptional virtuosity, enhanced by good looks and a most engaging stage presence, endeared him to the public and critics alike in a variety of roles. His first lead in a new choreography came when Michael Somes cast him for his <span class="italic">Summer Interlude</span>; and a few months later Balanchine chose him for <span class="italic">Trumpet Concerto</span> at Sadler's Wells Theatre. But it was John Cranko who worked most closely with Blair for several years, developing his talents over a wide range and creating for him, in 1951, the unforgettable Captain Belaye in <span class="italic">Pineapple Poll</span> to the music of Arthur Sullivan. Blair's portrayal of the dashingly handsome but ludicrously vain captain was a masterpiece of comedy which, combined with his brilliant dancing, helped to establish the ballet as one of the favourite British classics.<br>
<br>In 1953 Blair transferred to the &#145;parent&#146; company, Sadler's Wells Ballet (later the Royal Ballet) at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The change to a larger company and larger theatre was timely for his artistic development in the classical repertoire, for which his slightly mischievous, boyish charm and exuberance were almost a disadvantage&#151;although of course making him the ideal Franz in <span class="italic">Copp&eacute;lia</span>.<br>
<br>Blair soon mastered the noble style and partnered with great distinction all the Royal Ballet ballerinas including Svetlana Beriosova, Violetta Elvin, Annette Page, Rowena Jackson, Anya Linden, Margot Fonteyn, and especially Nadia Nerina, with whom he had an exceptionally successful partnership.<br>
<br>Blair's repertoire with the Royal Ballet included <span class="italic">The Three-Cornered Hat</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> and <span class="italic">Sleeping Beauty</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Giselle</span> and <span class="italic">Prince of the Pagodas</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Petrushka</span> (1959), and much more. In 1960 Frederick Ashton choreographed one of his greatest works, <span class="italic">La fille mal gard&eacute;e</span>, for Nadia Nerina and David Blair, who shared a triumphant success. Blair danced superbly the role of Colas, the country youth, giving him an irresistible air of amiable cheekiness. Another triumph was his Mercutio in Kenneth MacMillan's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. In 1961, on Michael Somes's retirement, David Blair succeeded him as principal dancer of the Royal Ballet.<br>
<br>Blair had a delightfully fresh enthusiasm for dance even when encountering the ups and downs from which no one is immune&#151;the road is always bumpier at the top than on the way up. But it would be hard to find a man more straightforward, staunch, without malice or guile, warm-hearted, and lovable. He spoke his mind in the forthright manner of a true Yorkshireman and he was also very human&#151;he had a soft shell for criticism.<br>
<br>Blair married in 1957 the ballerina Maryon Lane, who was born Patricia Mills, the daughter of an Irish doctor in Melmouth, Zululand, South Africa. Twin daughters, Diana and Catherine Blair, were born in 1960, and Diana, following her parents' profession, became a member of the Hamburg Ballet.<br>
<br>While still on the top as a dancer, Blair branched out into production with the complete versions of <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> (1965) and <span class="italic">Sleeping Beauty</span> (1966) for the Atlanta Civic Ballet. For American Ballet Theater he produced <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">Giselle</span> (1968). He was also the producer of the Hong Kong Ballet's <span class="italic">Giselle</span> and a filmed version of <span class="italic">Giselle</span> starring Carla Fracci and Erik Bruhn (1969).<br>
<br>In the history of British ballet David Blair stands in the forefront of accomplished male dancers. He set a standard of virtuoso dancing in the 1950s that inspired and influenced the following generation. In addition he gave much time and effort, mainly through his involvement with the Royal Academy of Dancing (he was a member of its executive committee from 1971), to the teaching of students and the resettlement of retiring professionals. His was a life devoted to dance and fellow dancers. For services to ballet he was appointed CBE in 1964. In 1973 his farewell to the stage at the Royal Opera House was an overwhelming personal triumph. He was about to take up directorship of the Norwegian Ballet in Oslo when on 1 April 1976 he died suddenly of a heart attack at his home in London, 19 Holland Park Road, Kensington, his wife surviving him.<br>
