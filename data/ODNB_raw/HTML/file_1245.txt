<span class="headword">Balmford,  James</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1556, <em>d.</em> after 1623), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is first recorded in 1594, the year in which he published <span class="italic">A Short and Plaine Dialogue Concerning the Unlawfulness of Playing at Cards</span>. This pamphlet of eight leaves is dedicated to his patrons, the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne; according to Hazlitt's <span class="italic">Hand-Book</span> the work also appeared as a broadside. In 1623 Balmford reprinted his <span class="italic">Dialogue</span>, prefacing it with an address to the reader, dated 14 September 1620, in which Balmford describes himself as &#145;a man of 64 yeares compleate&#146;, and adding to it a lengthy criticism of Thomas Gataker's <span class="italic">Of the Nature and Use of Lots</span> (1618), which was itself a response to Balmford's tract. Gataker quickly responded with <span class="italic">A Just Defence of &hellip; a Treatise Concerning the Nature and Use of Lots</span>, in which he followed contemporary practice by reproducing the whole of Balmford's work in his own, answering its objections point by point. Balmford's arguments rest on an analogy between cards and dice: that whereas lots depend wholly on chance, and are thus evil in that they are a denial of God's providence, cards depend somewhat on chance, and by analogy are somewhat evil. This is not to say that lots may not be used for the settling of controversies that otherwise could not be resolved&#151;and for this biblical precedent is cited; but since they depend on chance, they, and by analogy cards, are strictly forbidden as a source of amusement.<br>
<br>By 1603 Balmford was rector of St Olave's, Southwark. In that year, which saw a major outbreak of plague, he published <span class="italic">A Short Dialogue Concerning the Plagues Infection</span>, dedicated to his parishioners; he also published two different editions of a catechism (1597 and 1607). He also published in 1607 <span class="italic">Carpenter's Chippes, or, Simple Tokens of Unfeined Good Will to the Christian Friends of J. B., the Poor Carpenter's Sonne</span>. Dedicated to Margaret Clifford, countess of Cumberland, it reproduces an earlier work by Balmford dedicated to the third earl of Huntingdon on the lawfulness of executing Catholic priests, not on religious grounds but for treason, in that they had sworn fealty to a foreign potentate, namely the pope, and for seditiously teaching disobedience to the queen. He makes a comparison between priests and Anabaptists, asserting that the latter are justly condemned for denying the divine prerogative of the magistrate and not for their denial of the incarnation, however impious that may be. And likewise priests are not executed for believing damnable things, like the efficacy of prayers to the saints, but for denying the sovereignty of Elizabeth, whom the pope has excommunicated and thus separated from any obedience owed her by her subjects. Also included in <span class="italic">Carpenter's Chippes</span> is a treatise on the proper observance of Sunday, <span class="italic">Three Positions Concerning the Lord's Day</span>, first published earlier in 1607. The dedications of <span class="italic">Carpenter's Chippes</span> and <span class="italic">A Short and Plaine Dialogue</span> may indicate that Balmford had northern connections. No reference to him has been found after 1623, and it is not known when he died. He may have been the father of the Church of England clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1246/', "Samuel Bamford (d. 1657)")</script>.<br>
