<span class="headword">Balfour,  Jabez Spencer</span>  (1843&#150;1916), <span class="occ">company promoter and politician</span>, was born in Marylebone, Middlesex, on 4 September 1843, the younger son of James Balfour (1796&#150;1884) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1183/', "Clara Lucas Balfour (1808&#150;1878)")</script>, who were prominent workers in the mid-Victorian temperance movement. Balfour's career is best understood in the context of the increasingly prominent part played by militant middle-class nonconformists in the business world, in the Liberal Party generally, and in the anti-drink campaign in particular, during the later nineteenth century. After some years working as a parliamentary agent at Westminster, Balfour embarked in the late 1860s on an ambitious, spectacular, but ultimately disastrous course as promoter and director of a number of interlocking public companies involved in large-scale property development in London and the provinces. The continuous growth of the Balfour group of companies in the 1870s and 1880s rested on two simple but erroneous assumptions: first, that the judicious acquisition of suitable land and its development by speculative builders offered an infallible opportunity for profitable investment; and second, that the combined resources of many small savers represented a hitherto untapped but potentially unlimited source of capital which might be applied to this purpose. The Liberator Building Society (1868) was the key to Balfour's operations. Thanks to skilful publicity, an attractive rate of interest, and the effective use of contacts in the worlds of temperance and nonconformity the Liberator had become the country's largest building society by the end of the 1870s, with a nationwide network of local agents and thousands of depositors.<br>
<br>Balfour's growing eminence in the City was paralleled and reinforced by a career in radical politics. After his marriage in 1866 to Ellen Mead, he and his wife moved in 1869 to Croydon, where he was elected to the local school board in 1874 and served as first mayor of the borough in 1883&#150;4. He became Liberal MP for Tamworth in 1880, but following the borough's disfranchisement he was without a seat until 1889, when he was returned unopposed in a by-election at Burnley. An assiduous constituency man and a plausible public speaker, Balfour was said to have been disappointed at not being given office by Gladstone in 1892.<br>
<br>At the end of the 1880s Balfour gave every appearance of being a highly successful and prosperous public figure. Energetic, genial, and generous, he had acquired a country house at Burcot in Oxfordshire, and he and his wife had a son and a daughter. Balfour at this time boasted an impressive string of company directorships, but the subsequent economic recession revealed the speculative and unsound nature of his building schemes. From September 1892, when his London and General Bank (which had provided banking facilities for the Balfour group) suspended payment, his companies followed one another in quick succession into the bankruptcy courts. The demise of the Liberator caused a particular furore because many thrifty but misguided small investors lost their life savings. Investigations by the official receiver uncovered a sorry tale of misleading statements, false accounting, and petty fraud by Balfour and his fellow directors over many years. Faced with the likelihood of prosecution, Balfour resigned his seat in parliament and fled to Argentina in December 1892. His dramatic disappearance was immediately taken as an admission of guilt, and for many years afterwards his name was a byword for financial skulduggery and sanctimonious humbug. Eventually extradited in 1895, he was tried and sentenced to fourteen years' imprisonment. After his release in 1906, with maximum remission for good conduct, Balfour lived quietly in London and supported himself as a consulting engineer. He was travelling by train to take up a new appointment at Morriston colliery in south Wales when he died on 23 February 1916.<br>
