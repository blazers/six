<span class="headword">Fagan,  Robert</span>  (1761&#150;1816), <span class="occ">art dealer and portrait painter</span>, the son of Michael Fagan (1728&#150;1783), was born on 5 March 1761. The Fagans were from Cork, but his father had a successful bakery business at Long Acre, London, which was probably Fagan's birthplace. Reputedly a pupil of Bartolozzi, he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in 1781, though in the same year, with his fellow student Charles Grignion, he also went to Rome. He returned to London, presumably because of his father's illness, but by 1784 he was back in Rome, where he soon began to deal in pictures and to paint portraits, in the neo-classical style, of fashionable English visitors. On 23 April 1790 he married Anna Maria Aloisa Rosa Ferri (1773&#150;1800), evidently the daughter of an employee of the powerful Cardinal Rezzonico. Some British residents, such as the writer Cornelia Knight and her mother and the sculptor Joseph Nollekens, are reported to have found his social climbing most objectionable. His surviving portraits of that period (now in priv. coll.) include those of Sylvia Cotton (later Lady Mainwaring), Sir Corbet Corbet and his wife, and Elizabeth Webster (later Lady Holland)&#151;which Lord Bristol, bishop of Derry, rather naughtily kept at the foot of his bed. According to the Irish sculptor Christopher Hewetson, Fagan also copied old masters and had commissions for these from &#145;William Penn of Pennsylvania&#146;. Seventeen of his <i>trompe-l'&#339;il</i> grisailles were bought by the second Lord Berwick and are now at Attingham Hall, near Shrewsbury. Fagan's narcissistic self-portrait (<i>c</i>.1803, Limerick Museum, &Eacute;ire), with his bare-breasted and adoring second wife, reveals a handsome man, regular-featured with arched eyebrows and wavy hair, carefully arranged.<br>
<br>In 1792 Fagan was excavating at Gabii with Gavin Hamilton, and by 1794 at Laurentum and Ostia in alliance with Sir Corbet Corbet and Prince Augustus Frederick, later duke of Sussex. There were rich rewards from these diggings; some of them were bought by the prince of Wales, including the <span class="italic">Venus Campo Iemini</span> (now in the British Museum), while others were destined for the Vatican and Lateran museums. Among other items, Fagan found two important busts&#151;of the fourth-century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> priestess Corinna and of Licinius Sura, one of Trajan's generals; both are now in the Munich Glyptothek. Fagan is also credited with having discovered the first mithraeum at Ostia.<br>
<br>The French invasion of Italy in 1796 and Napoleon's intention of confiscating works of art caused panic among Roman princes. Fagan bought two landscapes by Claude Lorrain at bargain prices from Prince Altieri, and with Charles Grignion smuggled them out of Rome, an exciting Scarlet Pimpernel-type story involving Fagan's temporary imprisonment in Castel Sant'Angelo and a near shipwreck. For a while the pictures were owned by William Beckford; they are now at Anglesey Abbey near Cambridge. Fagan managed to return to Rome, where he set about excavating at Tor Boaccina and elsewhere&#151;only to have many of his treasures (valued at &pound;3000) seized by the French. He fled to Sicily, but was persuaded by Sir William Hamilton to go to Florence, in effect as a spy. After more adventures he returned to Rome, once again making shipments of important princely heirlooms and antiquities: one of these, <span class="italic">Titian's Schoolmaster</span> by Giovanni Battista Moroni, is now at the National Gallery of Art at Washington. Fagan's much neglected wife died in 1800, and immediately he married Maria Ludovica Francesca Geltrude Flajani, the beautiful fifteen-year-old daughter of a surgeon. From 1800 to 1807 he was mainly in Naples, the pope having forbidden indiscriminate excavations around Rome; here he continued with his portrait painting, and&#151;needless to say&#151;some lucrative excavating at Pompeii. Among the works painted at this time is his fine portrait of a Polish lawyer, Gabriel Taszycki, and his wife (now in the Warsaw National Museum). In 1807 Fagan and his family had to emigrate to Palermo; meanwhile, rich young William Baker, heir to Bayfordbury in Hertfordshire, had fallen in love with Estina, the daughter of Fagan and his first wife.<br>
<br>Having failed to prevent the marriage, Baker's father persuaded the foreign secretary, George Canning, to appoint Fagan consul-general for Sicily and Malta, a post for which he had for long been pestering Nelson and Sir William Hamilton; this was confirmed on 7 June 1809. Sicily by now was occupied by the British and the many political complications appear to have been well handled by Fagan, leading to a reconfirmation of the appointment in 1811. He still found time to excavate at Tyndaris and to make shipments of antiquities to England. He again painted portraits of English aristocrats, including the children of Lord Amherst (National Gallery of Ireland), and Lady Acton and her children  (priv. coll.); these works were in a harsher style than hitherto and not so successful. He charmed the unhappy Queen Maria Carolina and became her confidant in her quarrels with the minister-plenipotentiary, Lord William Bentinck (her outpourings in letters to Fagan are in the British Library). Thanks to the queen, he obtained new permits for excavating at Tyndaris and Selinunte.<br>
<br>Baker died in 1813, and in consequence Fagan, in 1814, had permission to return to England. Instead he stopped in Rome, in order to recover property and hoping to become consul there. Social life obviously went to his head, and the pope even asked his advice on political matters. Fagan, however, became seriously ill, but recovered and instead of returning to London went to Naples, again behaving grandly and indiscreetly. He was also in serious financial trouble. Ordered by the British government to return to Sicily, he nevertheless did at last visit London in 1815, but by January was back in Rome, once more ill. On 26 August 1816 he committed suicide, by throwing himself out of a window. He was buried in Rome. His widow was left in some difficulty, but eventually remarried. In 1817 she sold to the Vatican a colossal mask of Neptune that Fagan had excavated at Hadrian's villa, and in 1818&#150;20 several objects to the archaeological museum in Palermo, all now on view. Their daughter Emilia, Maria Carolina's goddaughter, died young; their son George became a diplomat in Naples and South America. The widowed Estina Baker later married Francis Acton, nephew (and brother-in-law) of Sir John Acton, prime minister of Naples.<br>
