<span class="headword">Stone,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1738, <em>d.</em> 1813), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was baptized on 13 July 1738 at the Temple Church, London, the son of Arthur Stone (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1740) of the Middle Temple and Fleet Street, London, and his wife, Susanna, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10029/', "Francis Fox (1675&#150;1738)")</script>, vicar of St Mary's, Reading. His father died before Francis's third birthday, and Francis was sent to Charterhouse School, where he became captain. Having been elected scholar, he matriculated from University College, Oxford, aged sixteen, on 15 May 1755, and graduated BA in 1759 and MA in 1766. In 1760 he became curate at Crawley, Hampshire, to his mother's brother-in-law Henry Taylor (1711&#150;1785), who was best known as the author of the <span class="italic">Apology of Ben Mordecai</span> (1771&#150;7); he adopted Taylor's Arian theology. In 1762, having married, he became curate of Worth, Sussex, where he formed a close friendship with neighbouring Arian clergymen William Hopkins (1706&#150;1786) and John Bristed, rector of Slaugham. Following the teaching of Gregory Sharpe (1713&#150;1771), Bristed taught Stone&#151;who had studied Hebrew with Thomas Hunt (1696&#150;1774), regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford&#151;to discard the vowel-points added to the text of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> by the early Hebrew grammarians who compiled the <span class="roman">Masorah</span>. On 11 May 1765, on presentation by the governors of Charterhouse, he was instituted to the rectory of Cold Norton, Essex.<br>
<br>Under the pseudonym of Tyro-Theologus, in 1768 Stone published <span class="italic">A short and seasonable application &hellip; in behalf of &hellip; a legal redress of &hellip; religious grievances</span>, in which he attacked the Athanasian creed and proposed a parliamentary petition to relieve clergymen from obligatory subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. He was particularly concerned with the burden on Anglicans who had adopted the anti-trinitarian belief in the simple humanity of Jesus, as against the Arian position that Christ, though God, was created by and subordinate to the Father. Gathering force from other Anglican adherents of &#145;rational religion&#146;, the movement culminated in the unsuccessful Feathers tavern petition of 1772, for which Stone recruited the large number of signatories among Essex clergymen [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>].<br>
<br>Having adopted anti-trinitarian beliefs himself, Stone began to advocate extensive alterations in church and state. In <span class="italic">A New Method of Discharging the National Debt</span> (1776) he called for appropriation of church property, the payment to all churchmen of a uniform annual stipend of &pound;200, and the removal of bishops from the House of Lords, subject to a life interest for sitting members. He supported the emancipation of slaves and a thoroughgoing reform of the House of Commons. In <span class="italic">An Examination of &hellip; Burke's &#145;Reflections&#146;</span> (1792) he stoutly defended Richard Price and the French legislative assembly; his extended attack on Burke himself rose to a climax in his contemptuous (and often funny) dismissal of Burke's vision of Marie Antoinette.<br>
<br>Stone's fellow clergymen often found him difficult but tolerated his views. On 8 July 1806, however, he passed acceptable limits in a sermon at Danbury during the visitation of William Gretton (1736&#150;1813), archdeacon of Essex. Published as <span class="italic">Jewish prophecy the sole criterion to distinguish between genuine and spurious Christian scripture</span>, the sermon rejected not only the Trinity but the virgin birth. Stone's offer to devote the profits of publication, amounting to &pound;5, to a fund for the widows of Essex clergy was rejected &#145;with disdain&#146;. Brought to trial on 13 May 1808 before Sir William Scott (afterwards Lord Stowell) in the consistory court of the bishop of London, Beilby Porteus, he was deprived of his living on 20 May; an appeal to the court of arches failed. In <span class="italic">A Letter to Dr. Beilby Porteus</span> (1807) he contended that at his ordination he had sworn only to teach doctrines clearly stated in scripture, thus superseding his earlier subscription to the wider scope of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>.<br>
<br>Thrown into debt by the loss of his living, worth &pound;300 a year, Stone, as a debtor, was confined within the rules of the king's bench prison from Michaelmas 1810. The Unitarian dissenters, who were just emerging as a denomination (on a largely Presbyterian base), had followed his trial in the consistory court with great interest, but disagreed about the morality of his remaining within the established church. Some noted that he had little choice, as he was by then over seventy years of age, had married for a second time, and had eight children, one of whom had been born after 1809. The Unitarians raised a subscription, from which he was paid &pound;100 a year. He died within the rules of the king's bench at 30 Garden Row, London Road, Southwark, on 1 November 1813.<br>
