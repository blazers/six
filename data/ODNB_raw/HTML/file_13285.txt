<span class="headword">Hill,  Joseph Sidney</span>  (1851&#150;1894), <span class="occ">missionary and bishop in Africa</span>, was born at Barnack, near Stamford, Northamptonshire, on 1 December 1851, son of Henry Hill, builder, who died at the age of twenty-five; his mother, a domestic servant, accepted help to send him to the Orphan Working School, Haverstock Hill, London, when he was nine. He was deeply affected by the death of a friend (whose surname, Sidney, he added to his own as a Christian name) and he determined to become a missionary. He applied to the Church Missionary Society (CMS), entered its preparatory institution at Reading in 1872, and proceeded to its college at Islington, London, in 1874. Hill was made a deacon by the bishop of London in 1876, and shortly afterwards, on 31 July 1876, he married Lucilla (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of Thomas Leachman, and proceeded to Lagos in west Africa. Within a few months he and his wife became seriously ill and they were forced to return to England.<br>
<br>Hill next served as a curate in Richmond, Surrey, for a year before being sent by the CMS to New Zealand. He was appointed to Wairoa, Hawke's Bay, and was ordained priest in 1879. He was to work among the Maori but had little support from his fellow missionaries and found the Maori language very difficult to master. He therefore applied to work in Auckland and resigned from the CMS in 1882. In Auckland he served mainly as a missionary and as a prison chaplain. He returned to England in 1890, again as a missionary, with the Revd W. Hay Aitken; the following year he offered to go to west Africa once again with the CMS.<br>
<br>The CMS's west African mission was in a state of crisis, brought on first by the actions of intolerant young European missionaries who condemned the leadership of Bishop Samuel Crowther and his fellow African clergy in the Niger delta. The missionaries had also attacked the CMS for its failure to back them in the way they thought appropriate, and the society pusillanimously conceded to many of their demands. However, Crowther then died, at the end of 1891. In this context it was inevitable that the west African church had a very strong commitment to Crowther's successor being an African, while the missionaries and their supporters in England had an equally strong conviction that he must be a European. The latter won the day, and in 1892 Hill was their choice.<br>
<br>Hill was widely acceptable, having many of the personal qualities required to deal with the intensity of feeling in England and in west Africa, where there was now a danger that a church independent of Anglican structures might be created. Archbishop Benson, who was far more sympathetic to the African perspective than the CMS, insisted that Hill went to west Africa, as his commissary, prior to his consecration, to investigate the situation and to find two African assistant bishops. Hill did so in 1892, and he produced a fair-minded report which steered a middle course between the CMS (by then in effect anti-African) and the west Africans. His consecration, together with that of the two African assistant bishops he had chosen, followed on 29 June 1893. He left for west Africa in November 1893, but on 6 January 1894 he died of blackwater fever, in Lagos, where he was buried. His wife died the next day and four other missionaries died within a fortnight.<br>
<br>Hill's successor was another Englishman, Herbert Tugwell (1855&#150;1936), whose nomination and consecration were pushed through with great and unusual haste in order to reduce the build-up of new pressure for the appointment of an African. This appointment was much resented in west Africa and the CMS became even more distrustful of non-European leadership. Tugwell, however, was often at variance with the CMS. Instead he came to see the need for, and the propriety of, African oversight at every level in the church.<br>
