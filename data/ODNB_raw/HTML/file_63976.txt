<span class="headword">Marsh,  Alec</span>  (1908&#150;1996), <span class="occ">jockey and horse-racing official</span>, was born on 12 August 1908 at Staunton in the Vale, Nottinghamshire, the son of George Ernest Marsh, farmer, and his wife, Lily Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bramley. He hunted from an early age, graduated to point-to-point racing, and won his first race under National Hunt rules on Common Ground over hurdles at Warwick in February 1929. He was leading amateur rider for three consecutive seasons from 1934&#150;5 but gave up riding in 1940 after a fall too many. He had ridden in over 1000 races, and had won 163 of them, including 21 on the flat. He won the Cheltenham foxhunters twice, in 1935 on Empire Night and in 1936 on Herod Bridge; the Liverpool foxhunters in 1936, on Don Bradman; and dead-heated for the Grand Sefton that year on the same horse. At one stage the National Hunt committee, anxious to protect the livelihood of paid riders, counselled him to turn professional himself, but he ignored their advice. Under the existing Jockey Club regulations this would have prevented him pursuing a career as a racing official. On 31 March 1937 he married Elizabeth Mary Jessop (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), daughter of Major Thomas Jessop of the Lincolnshire yeomanry. There was one son of the marriage.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Marsh served with the RAF in Europe, Singapore, Burma, China, and India. On demobilization he acted as a starter for the Royal Calcutta turf club before returning to Britain to be appointed an official starter by the Jockey Club in 1947. He officiated at his first classic in 1952 and in that year also became the senior starter for the club. A further 100 classic starts were to come before his retirement in 1972, after a career in which he began over 25,000 races. As starter his job was to assist in keeping a race fair to all participants, including the punters, by ensuring that all horses were at the start in the correct draw and ready to go when he gave the signal. In the days before starting stalls this also required keeping the horses in line to prevent one being left or allowing a jockey to steal a flying start. Marsh compared starting to driving a car:<blockquote>Just as, with the right timing it is possible to overtake six cars at once, so with keen anticipation, one should eventually catch all the horses facing the right way simultaneously. No use panicking or losing one's temper. It all hinges on timing. (Sharpe, 119)</blockquote>Initially he did not like the mechanical aspects of starting stalls, first used at Newmarket in 1965, which, of course, much changed his job. However, he later admitted that they benefited the sport.<br>
<br>Marsh always arrived at courses wearing his tweeds and bowler hat and carrying a red flag for use by the recall man stationed down the course in case of a false start. In wet weather he would wear galoshes; in dry, shiny brown brogues. As an ex-rider himself, his authority was generally respected by the jockeys. He made it a point seldom to speak to jockeys &#145;because it is irrational to speak to them in one breath, and shout at them in the next&#146;  (Sharpe, 119). His authority could be mistaken for arrogance: one jockey described him as &#145;a cold fish with no favourites&#146;, but added that he was &#145;damned good at his job&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 22 Nov 1997). On retirement Marsh reflected that &#145;they have been good years, neither free from criticism nor from strain&#151;but they fulfilled my ambition&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>His first marriage having ended in divorce in 1959, Marsh married second, on 22 June 1972, Marjorie Minnie Cole (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), widow, of Easthorpe, Bottesford, Nottinghamshire, and daughter of Henry Norris, farmer. He died on 17 November 1996 at Grantham and District Hospital, Grantham, Lincolnshire, of ischaemic heart disease; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
