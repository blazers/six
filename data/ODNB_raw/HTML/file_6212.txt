<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooper,  Charles Henry</span>  (1808&#150;1866), <span class="occ">biographer and antiquary</span>, was born at Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on 20 March 1808, the eldest of the ten children of Basil Henry Cooper (1783&#150;1823), solicitor, and Harriet (1787&#150;1860), daughter of Charles Shoppee of Uxbridge. He was educated at home until he reached his seventh year, when he was sent to a school kept by a Mr Cannon at Reading. There he remained to the end of 1822. From an early age he evinced a passion for reading, and as his father possessed an extensive library, he was able to lay the foundation of his ample stock of historical and antiquarian knowledge. In 1826 he settled at Cambridge, and applied himself diligently to the study of the law. He married at Ely on 17 September 1834 Jane (1805&#150;1890), third and youngest daughter of John and Elizabeth Thompson of Prickwillow, Cambridgeshire, and they had eight children, of whom only the biographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32556/', "Thompson Cooper (1837&#150;1904)")</script>, his brother John William LLD (1845&#150;1906), of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and their sister Harriet Elizabeth survived.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1836, when the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> came into operation, Cooper was elected coroner of the borough, though he was not admitted a solicitor until four years later. In 1849 he was appointed town clerk of Cambridge, which office he held until his death. In 1851 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. A fine speaker, he acquired an extensive practice as a solicitor. In 1855 he was engaged in the Cambridge arbitration which resulted in the <span class="roman">Award Act</span> of the following year to settle differences between the university and borough, and he was complimented for his learning and acumen by the arbitrator, Sir John Patteson. In a busy public life he supported liberal and progressive measures, such as the founding of the public library and improvements to Addenbrooke's Hospital.<br>
<br>Cooper is now better known, however, for his elaborate works relating to the history and topography of Cambridge and the biography of distinguished members of the university. His first book was <span class="italic">A New Guide to the University and Town of Cambridge</span>, published anonymously in 1831. It was superior to most works of its class, especially in its architectural descriptions. In 1842 the first volume appeared of the <span class="italic">Annals of Cambridge</span>, which was followed by three other volumes, dated respectively 1843, 1845, and 1852, and by a portion of a fifth  (pp. 1&#150;128) in 1853, completed by his son John, and finally published in 1908 with additions, corrections, and an index.<br>
<br>This work is arranged chronologically, and contains an account of the history of the university and town from the legendary times of Cantaber to 1856. It was brought out in parts by subscription amid great difficulties. Many of the academic authorities opposed its publication, as they mistakenly believed that it would in some way deprive the university of its ancient privileges. In 1858 the first volume appeared of a more ambitious work, <span class="italic">Athenae Cantabrigienses</span>, written jointly by Cooper and his eldest son, Thompson. The idea of the book was suggested by Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>. It contains carefully written memoirs of the worthies who received their education or were incorporated at Cambridge University, and, like the companion work of Wood, is arranged in chronological order according to the date of death. The first volume dealt with the period 1500&#150;85, and the second, published in 1861, extends to 1609. Part of a third volume, extending to 1611, was printed but not published, though several of the memoirs in this unfinished volume were afterwards reproduced in abbreviated form in Thompson Cooper's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span>. Like the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, this work, which was at once recognized as a valuable addition to British biographical literature, was published by private subscription. After Cooper's death the university offered to pay for the printing of the remainder of the <span class="italic">Athenae</span>, but his two sons, after making some further progress with the manuscript, were forced by the pressure of their own work to abandon the undertaking. It was, however, completed and finally published by G. J. Gray in 1913.<br>
<br>Cooper's last work was <span class="italic">The Memorials of Cambridge</span> (3 vols., 1858&#150;66). Cooper originally intended to base it on John Le Keux's work of the same title, but during its progress it was altered so extensively that it may be regarded as substantially a new work. Cooper was a constant contributor to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">East Anglian</span>, <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, the local press, and the proceedings of the antiquarian societies of London and Cambridge. He always ungrudgingly assisted in any literary undertaking. Thomas Carlyle, in his <span class="italic">Life and Letters of Cromwell</span>, acknowledged the value of the information given to him by Cooper, as did many other writers. Cooper died at his residence, 29 Jesus Lane, Cambridge, on 21 March 1866 and was buried at Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge, on 26 March. Most of the books in his library were sold by Sotheby between 28 and 30 October 1891. He left in manuscript a &#145;Memoir of Margaret&#146;, about the mother of Henry VII. This work, written in 1839, was edited and published in 1874 by the Revd J. E. B. Mayor &#145;for the two colleges of her foundation&#146;&#151;Christ's and St John's. Mayor, who for thirteen years was Cooper's intimate literary friend, described him shortly after his death as &#145;the town's chief ornament&#146;, admired for &#145;his intelligence, his ready memory, his rare familiarity with English history, topography, and biography, his wide range of reading, his large and statesmanlike view of persons and events&#146;, who shared his knowledge generously and whose death left a void that could not be filled  (Mayor, <span class="italic">Cambridge Chronicle</span>, 8). He also predicted that Cooper's historical works would be cited more often than any other Cambridge books of his day. So it has proved to be.<br>
