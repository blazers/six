<span class="headword">Hodder,  Matthew Henry</span>  (1830?&#150;1911), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was baptized on 5 January 1831 at Providence Independent Chapel, Uxbridge, Middlesex, the fourth among the ten children of Thomas Henry Hodder (<i>b</i>. 1803), a chemist and druggist, and Jane Elizabeth Rayner (<i>bap</i>. 1809). His younger brother, Edwin, became an author. Matthew Hodder's schooling was elementary, and on 5 August 1844 he arrived in London to be apprenticed to Jackson and Walford, publishers to the Congregational Union. At sixteen he experienced religious conversion at the King's Weigh House Chapel, and there he met his future wife, Frances Ann Biddulph (<i>bap</i>. 1830, <i>d</i>. 1917). Hodder married Frances on 5 July 1855 at Denmark Place Baptist Chapel, Camberwell, London. Before marriage he lived near Tower Hill and Frances lodged at Rotherhithe. Their only child, Mary Frances, was born on 22 April 1856 at Camberwell, where the family lived until 1869.<br>
<br>In 1861 with savings of &pound;6335 Hodder bought a third share in the Jackson and Walford business, which traded as Jackson, Walford, and Hodder until 1868. To buy out his ageing partners Hodder sought a congenial partner with funds. He found him in <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56401/', "Thomas Wilberforce Stoughton")</script>. Various occasions have been suggested for Hodder's acquaintance with Stoughton: both were in the orbit of the Congregationalist Dr Thomas Binney; both had fathers who had lived in Windsor; Jackson, Walford, and Hodder were publishers to Thomas's father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26606/', "Dr John Stoughton")</script>. Hodder and Stoughton established their publishing partnership on 16 June 1868 at 27 Paternoster Row, London. In June 1869 Hodder sailed to the USA and Canada, promoting his publishing business and speaking at religious meetings as delegate for the YMCA. According to his diary of this journey he never lost an opportunity to convert a soul to Christianity. He returned in September to a new house, Gothic Lodge, on Bromley Common, Kent. Hodder's frequent profitable journeys to North America, the last in 1899, kept the firm solvent; he also travelled the north of England and London. In 1871 G. A. Sala was awarded &pound;500 damages in a libel action against the firm, based on its publication of a work by J. H. Friswell (1870).<br>
<br>Publishing was an aspect of Hodder's evangelism. He was a connoisseur of sermons, and this devotion resulted in many titles: Joseph Parker's <span class="italic">Ecce Deus</span> (1868), his series <span class="roman">The City Temple Pulpit</span>, and Paxton Hood's <span class="italic">Life of Dr Binney</span> (1874). In its second year the firm published J. J. van Osterzee's <span class="italic">Theology of the New Testament</span> (1870), the first of several of his works translated from the Dutch. The scientific theology of Henry Drummond's <span class="italic">Natural Law in the Spiritual World</span> (1883) challenged traditional belief and was published only on commission. In 1887 the first of forty-eight volumes of <span class="italic">The Expositor's Bible</span> was published. Theology and devotional works dominated the list, and secular titles had to meet a strict evangelical morality. Hodder's salesmanship and his luck, as in his purchase of the text of William Thayer's <span class="italic">From Log Cabin to White House</span> (1881) just before the murder of President Garfield, supported publication of expensive theological works in English and Greek.<br>
<br>Hodder conducted a mission on Bromley Common, was chairman of the General Committee of the YMCA, and led its &pound;160,000 building appeal. In maturity he had the appearance of a benevolent patriarch with a long white beard and soft voice. He was active in publishing until a few weeks before his death at Carisbrooke, his home on Bromley Common, on 18 October 1911. After a funeral service at St Luke's Church, Bromley Common, he was buried in St Luke's cemetery on 21 October.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_47459"></a><span class="headword">Sir (John) Ernest  Hodder-Williams</span>  (1876&#150;1927), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 16 September 1876 at Bromley, Kent, the eldest of seven children of John T. Williams (1844&#150;1931) and Mary Frances (1856&#150;1931), only child of Matthew Henry and Frances Hodder. His father, nephew of Sir George Williams, founder of the YMCA, came from Dorset. John Ernest was given the third baptismal name Hodder and was known as Ernest. Williams attended Quernmore School, Bromley, and from 1889 to 1891 the City of London School. He spent a year in Paris and Berlin and attended the English course at University College, London, for one year before joining Hodder and Stoughton in 1894 under the tutelage of W. R. Nicoll. In 1901 he toured North America and studied its book trade. On 4 October 1902 he was made a partner of Hodder and Stoughton, and on 9 October he married Ethel (1872&#150;1918), publisher's reader and younger daughter of John George Oddy JP, in Holt United Free Methodist Church, Norfolk; Matthew Hodder and John Williams provided a special train to carry guests from London. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1906 Ernest Williams negotiated a joint venture with Oxford University Press, and in 1908 the firm bought into George Doran Company, New York, designating Williams vice-chairman. He became a best-selling author with <span class="italic">Where's Master?</span> (1910), written on the death of Edward VII about the royal dog. After Hodder's death in 1911 Williams led the firm until the death in 1917 of the surviving founding partner, Thomas W. Stoughton, when he became senior partner. He was unfit to enlist in the 1914&#150;18 war but was close to its political conduct. He wrote, edited, and published propaganda for the government and produced fund-raising books such as <span class="italic">Princess Mary's Gift Book</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">King Albert's Book</span> (1914). In 1915 Williams was made liveryman of the Stationers' Company and co-opted to the City of London corporation; in 1918 he was elected chairman of its county purposes committee.<br>
<br>Ethel Williams died of cancer on 15 June 1918, and Ernest sold their home at Bickley, Kent, where they had entertained wounded soldiers, and took a flat in town. On 6 June 1919 he adopted by deed poll the surname Hodder-Williams. That month he went to Paris for the signing of the peace treaty, and in December he registered the firm as a limited company, with Cecil Stoughton and Percy Hodder Williams as the other two directors. Under Hodder-Williams's direction the firm launched cheap fiction reprints known as &#145;Yellow Jackets&#146; (price 2<i>s</i>.), entered a joint venture as University of London Press Ltd (1920), acquired Wakley &amp; Son, publishers of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (1920), and joined with Liverpool University Press. He was chairman of the Royal Female Orphanage at Beddington, Surrey, and introduced reforms consistent with his support for female suffrage. On 4 August 1920 he married Lilian (<i>d</i>. 1959), daughter of John R. Pakeman, at St George's, Hanover Square, London. They had no children. Knighted in 1919, he received other British and European honours for his war efforts: he was appointed CVO (1921) and a knight of grace of the order of St John of Jerusalem (1921), was awarded the M&eacute;daille du roi (Albert I of Belgium) (1920), and was made ufficiale della corona d'Italia (1920) and commendatore (1921).<br>
<br>Hodder-Williams's leadership of the firm was enterprising though not unfailingly meticulous or successful; he took life intensely and sometimes suffered physically; his personality was magnetic, inspiring loyalty in family and employees. In January 1927 he suffered an internal haemorrhage and died of heart failure on 8 April 1927 at his home, 23 Cadogan Place, London SW1. On 12 April a City memorial service was held at Christ Church, Greyfriars, followed by the funeral at Westminster Chapel, Buckingham Gate, and burial in St Luke's cemetery, Bromley Common. His widow gave &pound;1000 to St Thomas's Hospital to endow a bed.<br>
