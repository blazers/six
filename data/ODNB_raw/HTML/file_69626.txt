<span class="headword">Hepburn,  Margaret</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> in or after 1758), <span class="occ">shopkeeper</span>, was baptized on 4 September 1726 at St Giles, Edinburgh, the second daughter of the four children of John Hepburn (<i>d</i>. 1771), minister of Old Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, and of Margaret Fenton, daughter of Thomas Fenton, merchant and bailie of Edinburgh. In company with her business partner, Lilias Christie, Margaret sold and hired funeral provisions of all kinds before this kind of supply became part of the undertaker's business. The term of undertaker did not come into use in Scotland until the second half of the eighteenth century. What is particularly interesting about Margaret Hepburn is that, although her father came from a professional background, through her mother she was part of a well-established family network of Edinburgh burgesses, all of whom were operating in similar businesses. Her mother's two sisters, Emelia and Isobel, married merchants; Isobel's husband, Paul Husband, was a well-known wholesale supplier of funeral provisions to other shopkeepers and their daughter Emelia married Thomas Elder, a well-known wine merchant, who could also supply wine for funerals. The wives in this family network were involved in the businesses, personally receipting customers' bills. The fact that Margaret Hepburn's grandmother was Emelia Christie suggests that Margaret and her business partner were related, probably as cousins. The two women not only supplied plum cake and biscuit but also had to provide mourning draperies for the house and the church, and to contact a &#145;master household&#146;, who made all the practical arrangements on the day of the funeral. Margaret's bills show that items such as sugar-tongs, glasses, and sconces for the candles were hired and that the customer had to pay for any glasses that were broken.<br>
<br>The fact that Margaret's father was a minister probably helped the two women to gain contacts. These personal contacts were vital in the business world of eighteenth-century Scotland, where word of mouth was more important in building up a clientele than reliance on advertising. Margaret Hepburn, with Lilias Christie, supplied clients both in the burgh community and in the country, including landed families. Surviving bills show that she was in business from 1749 to 1758 but she may well have been in business before and after these dates. The 1749 bill was due by the countess of Roxburghe, who would have been unlikely to employ someone who had only recently set up in business. By 1758 Margaret (who never married) appears to have been trading on her own, her business partner having died. Margaret Hepburn did not leave a will and the date of her death is not known.<br>
