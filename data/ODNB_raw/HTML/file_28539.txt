<span class="headword">Wallace,  Robert</span>  (1697&#150;1771), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer on population</span>, was born on 7 January 1697 in Kincardine, Perthshire, the only son of Matthew Wallace (<i>d</i>. 1727), Church of Scotland minister for the parish, and his wife, Margaret Stewart. Robert was educated at Stirling grammar school and matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1711. He studied divinity, excelled in mathematics under Professor James Gregory at Edinburgh, and taught the professor's classes in 1720. In 1722 he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Dunblane, Perthshire, and assigned to the parish of Moffat the following year. On 14 October 1726 he married Helen Turnbull (1706&#150;1776), daughter of George Turnbull, minister of Tyninghame. They had three children: one daughter and two sons, including <a href="#cosubject_28531">George Wallace (1730&#150;1805) [<i>see below</i>]</a>. <br>
<br>In 1729 Robert Wallace was elected moderator of the provincial synod of Dumfries. His synod sermon, <span class="italic">The Regard due to Divine Revelation</span>, published in 1731 together with a prefatory response to Matthew Tindal's <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>, was well received by Queen Caroline, who arranged his translation to the Edinburgh pulpit of New Greyfriars in 1733. He moved to New North Church, Edinburgh, in 1738.<br>
<br>Though predisposed toward a life of reflection Wallace emerged as a leader in ecclesiastical politics. In the 1730s he became identified with the squadrone opposition interest. Aligning himself with Robert Dundas, Lord Arniston, he opposed the efforts of Archibald Campbell, third earl of Ilay, Sir Robert Walpole's Scottish manager, to implement a system of church patronage designed to pacify the kirk. His identification with opposition politics solidified during the Porteous affair of 1736. The <span class="roman">Porteous Act</span>, against harbouring &#145;rioters&#146; who participated in the murder of Captain Porteous, required ministers to read the act monthly from their pulpits. Wallace, in council with Arniston, led a group of Edinburgh ministers who successfully resisted complying. In August 1739 Wallace was appointed chaplain in Scotland for Frederick, prince of Wales, then a magnate for the opposition. The following year he preached against the government from the New North pulpit when he suggested that Walpole was managing the war in accord with his own private interests rather than those of Britain.<br>
<br>With the change of ministry in 1742 Wallace was chosen to manage the crown's patronage of kirk benefices by the new minister for Scottish affairs, John, fourth marquess of Tweeddale. Conciliatory in discharging these duties, Wallace attempted to balance the interests of heritors and local elders. He was elected moderator of the general assembly in the following year and was appointed a royal chaplain for Scotland and dean of the Chapel Royal in 1744. His formal leadership in the kirk ceased in 1746 with the demise of Tweeddale's ministry.<br>
<br>Thereafter Wallace turned increasingly to his scholarly interests, though he was still occasionally visible in political controversies. As an Edinburgh minister he was also a trustee of George Heriot's Hospital, a responsibility he took seriously. In 1759 and 1760 he and several other ministers publicly opposed efforts by the town provost, George Drummond, to appropriate hospital land for the construction of Edinburgh's New Town. Two years later he opposed the town council's attempt to circumvent the kirk's general sessions in filling an Edinburgh pulpit with John Drysdale, an issue which focused popular sentiment against the city's managerial &eacute;lite. Late in life Wallace's political sympathies were with the new spirit of radicalism associated with John Wilkes.<br>
<br>While leading the kirk in the 1740s Wallace was instrumental in the establishment of the widow's fund, a project uniting his mathematical interests, political skills, and reformist inclinations. The fund was an insurance scheme to provide for the widows and orphans of kirk ministers. With assistance from Colin MacLaurin, Wallace performed the calculations on the data collected by Alexander Webster and derived a suitable formula for the plan. As moderator in 1743 he used his connections with Arniston and Tweeddale to gain support for the proposals in parliament. When the political climate appeared favourable Wallace and George Wishart were commissioned for London to request passage of the plan, which, once implemented in 1744, became one of the first truly successful insurance programmes in Britain.<br>
<br>Wallace contributed to the intellectual fermentation then under way in Edinburgh. A founding member of the Rankenian Club during his university days, he was also active in the Philosophical and Select societies. He was in the vanguard of the new moderate church leadership that helped create the milieu in which Edinburgh's literati thrived after mid-century. Ecclesiastically latitudinarian, he favoured an incorporating national church without creedal ordination tests, a church capable of mitigating the effects from dangerous factional extremes like popular enthusiasm and radical freethinking. For instance, he quietly opposed the revivalism that spread through Scotland in the 1740s in the conviction that such preaching presented unscrupulous, politically ambitious men with dangerous influence over the passions of the lower orders.<br>
<br>Wallace's intellectual curiosity, spirit of liberality, and commitment to the free exchange of ideas made him a role model for members of the ecclesiastical moderate party of younger men who gained control of church politics in the 1750s under William Robertson's leadership. Wallace shared with the moderates a fundamental opposition to the evangelical and Calvinistic forces in the church. Even so, his political and social outlook contained a radical, egalitarian edge that kept him from close alignment with Robertson's coterie. He could not abide their unequivocal support for the law of patronage, the tool by which they gained control of church politics, and one of the issues at stake in the Drysdale &#145;Bustle&#146; of 1762, in which Wallace and the moderates took opposing sides. Nor did Wallace share in their enthusiasm for James Macpherson's controversial &#145;recovery&#146; of the Ossianic poetry, which Hugh Blair promoted as a Homeric production of an ancient, virtuous, and noble race of Scots. Less sanguine about such an ancient, noble race, Wallace attributed the success of Ossian to moderate party factionalism that threatened to distort good judgement and taste. Nor was he in sympathy with the moderates' attempt to revive the Edinburgh theatre by staging John Home's <span class="italic">Douglas</span> in 1756 over and against the popular cry that the stage was a breeding ground for sin and vice. Wallace opposed this Calvinistic attack on <span class="italic">Douglas</span>, but argued on classical republican grounds that an active theatre would tempt Edinburgh's social &eacute;lite with another indulgent diversion of economic resources from useful projects of public service. Ideologically out of step as he was with both emerging church parties, Wallace's tendency from the 1750s was to dissociate himself from church politics, finding consolation in quiet walks, stoic philosophy, and scholarly pursuits.<br>
<br>Wallace's publications typically sought to counter the influence of various freethinkers whose ideas threatened to erode commitment either to virtue or to liberty. Among these Bernard Mandeville, author of <span class="italic">Fable of the Bees</span>, was a favourite target. Wallace developed an innovative response to Mandeville's provocative political economy of passions and interests, private vices producing public benefits. In his <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Numbers of Mankind</span> (1753) Wallace argued that the traditional agrarian virtues of &#145;frugality, temperance, simplicity, contentment with a little, and patience of labour&#146; were more rational and more efficient at producing happiness than the commercial vices of Mandeville's imagined bees; to argue the case, he presented an elaborate history of population based on the extensive research in ancient history that he had originally presented to the Philosophical Society some time before 1745.<br>
<br>Wallace opened the <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> with a hypothetical model for the geometrical rate of world population growth, beginning from an assumed original pair. The model demonstrated that present world population was far below its potential&#151;a fact which, coupled with his historical argument for greater populations in the past, begged an explanation for humankind's failure to populate the earth. For this he attended to the impact of economic forces and cultural tastes on marriage patterns. Traditional agrarian societies produce an inexpensive subsistence, encouraging men and women toward early, fruitful marriages. Appetites and tastes are correspondingly simple. Economies of large, modern commercial states, by contrast, are driven by exchanges of non-essential luxuries. With a smaller percentage of the work-force in agriculture essential goods are correspondingly expensive. Tastes and appetites become attuned to luxuries, or &#145;overrefinement&#146;, delaying marriage and setting off a decline in both population and civic virtue.<br>
<br>As Wallace was completing work on the <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> in 1751 he showed it to fellow Philosophical Society member David Hume, who reciprocated with the essay he published in the <span class="italic">Political Discourses</span> of 1752: &#145;Of the populousness of ancient nations&#146;. Hume questioned the accuracy of population estimates in ancient sources, and argued for the superiority of modern assessments of population. Nevertheless, his essay included a graciously worded acknowledgement of debt to Wallace, that &#145;eminent clergyman in Edinburgh&#146;, whose work, if published, would shed additional light on this &#145;the most curious and important of all questions of erudition&#146;  (Heinemann, 10). Wallace published the <span class="italic">Dissertation</span> the following year with a long appendix addressing Hume's essay. This polite exchange was widely celebrated as a model for the pursuit of truth in an enlightened age. Montesquieu supervised the translation of both works into French. In the <span class="italic">Confessions</span> Rousseau acknowledged the spirit of the debate, praising Hume in particular for having helped edit Wallace's text.<br>
<br>Underneath this population debate were fundamental assumptions about the nature of a rationally organized society, issues to which Wallace devoted considerable attention. He composed, for instance, an unorthodox essay on sexual and marital practices, &#145;Of venery&#146; (published by Norah Smith in <span class="italic">Texas Studies in Literature and Language</span>, 15, 1973, 429&#150;44), in which he lamented an onerous injustice suffered by women in the present age of over-refined tastes and indulgent appetites. Men, instead of acting on natural sexual urges and being relatively indiscriminate in the selection of partners, now sought marriage guided by artificially high standards of feminine beauty, consigning many women to remaining single and lonely. He wanted marriage redefined as a freely negotiable and dissolvable contract. Hence sexual relationships would become less exclusive, more democratic, less prone to jealousy, more widely disseminated, and more conducive to happiness and population growth. In this and other proposals his thoughts were inspired by the image of Thomas More's ideal society.<br>
<br>Wallace also took an interest in agrarian reform. He decried the lack of attention to agriculture among leading families who directed their sons toward the liberal professions or the military rather than toward agricultural improvement. His unpublished essay &#145;Of the prices and dearth of provisions in different numbers referring to one another&#146; (Edinburgh University Library, Laing II 620:11) proposed planned villages with more equitably divided farm land, safeguards against enclosure, and integration of agriculture with small scale manufactures, a model he felt would be morally and culturally superior to both British town and hamlet. These concerns are likewise reflected in his &#145;Treatise on taste&#146; (Edinburgh University Library, DC 1 55), an unpublished response to Lord Kames's <span class="italic">Elements of Criticism</span>, in which Wallace argued that aristocratic houses should be designed without courtyards to better direct a great family's view toward its chief proper concern, the fields.<br>
<br>Among Wallace's other published works, <span class="italic">The Characteristics of the Present Political State of Great Britain</span> (1758) defended the British constitution and culture against John Brown's assault in <span class="italic">An Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times</span>. While Wallace was not unsympathetic to elements of Brown's critique, the latter's accusations of national effeminacy, coming as they did in the midst of critical failures in the British war against despotic France, did not serve the cause of constitutional government. The <span class="italic">Various Prospects of Mankind, Nature and Providence</span> (1761), a metaphysical defence of a morally ordered universe, is best remembered today as a principal source of Thomas Malthus's population calculus in the <span class="italic">Essay on the Principle of Population</span>. The <span class="italic">Various Prospects</span> revisited two of Wallace's favourite themes, a perfected human order modelled after More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span>, and his population calculus from the <span class="italic">Dissertation</span>. He reasoned that a perfected constitution, once established, would be victimized by its own success in the unforgiving calculus of geometric population growth. Wallace again appealed to More's ideal republic in a sermon preached for the Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, <span class="italic">Ignorance and Superstition a Source of Violence and Cruelty</span> (1746), in which he preferred its design to Mandeville's social theory. A prolific author, a large collection of his unpublished works is held in the Laing collection, Edinburgh University Library. Wallace died in Edinburgh on 29 July 1771.<br>
<br>His youngest son, <a name="cosubject_28531"></a><span class="headword">George Wallace</span>  (1730&#150;1805), <span class="occ">lawyer and writer</span>, was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh in 1754. He was a member with his father of the Rankenian Club, and a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He wrote a memoir of his father that appeared in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span> for July 1771. He also published <span class="italic">A System of the Principles of the Law of Scotland</span> (1760), which deserves recognition as the source for the article on <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Origin of Feudal Tenures and the Descent of Ancient Peerages in Scotland</span> (1783), with a second edition; <span class="italic">Nature and Descent of Ancient Peerages Connected with the State of Scotland</span>, (8 vols., 1785); and <span class="italic">Prospects from Hills in Fife</span> (1796), a poem modelled after James Thomson's &#145;Seasons&#146;. He died in 1805.<br>
