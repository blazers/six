<span class="headword">Doughty,  William</span>  (1757&#150;1781/2), <span class="occ">portrait painter and engraver</span>, born in York on 1 August 1757, was baptized on 14 August 1757 at St Michael le Belfrey, the son of John Doughty, the keeper of a fishing-tackle shop, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kirby. At the age of fourteen he produced two etchings which have survived: portraits of Thomas Beckwith after T. Barow and of Bacon Morritt after Vaslet; an earlier etched portrait of the Revd Mr Elgin has not survived. Doughty was recommended to Sir Joshua Reynolds by the Revd William Mason and, on being accepted, lived in Reynolds's house in Leicester Fields, Westminster, having enrolled as his pupil on 8 April 1775. He exhibited a portrait at the Royal Academy's exhibition in 1776. During his three years' residence with Reynolds, Doughty etched a portrait after a drawing by Mason of the poet Thomas Gray (1716&#150;1771). On 9 August 1777, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he married Margaret Joy, probably also from York and one of Reynolds's servants.<br>
<br>On leaving Reynolds in 1778 Doughty visited York and then went to Ireland, intending to reside there for a few months. In a letter to Hely-Hutchinson, Reynolds expressed a high opinion of Doughty's abilities and prospects, and Ellis Waterhouse considered him to have been &#145;potentially the ablest of Reynolds's students&#146;  (Waterhouse, 112). Doughty returned from Ireland at the end of 1778 and settled in Little Titchfield Street. He then produced a series of excellent mezzotints after Reynolds, who was particularly impressed with Doughty's interpretation of his portrait of Samuel Johnson. Reynolds advised Doughty to make a career as a mezzotint engraver, but Doughty was ambitious for recognition as a painter, and as his wife had friends in Bengal they decided to seek their fortune there. They embarked in 1780, but their ship was captured and Doughty was taken to Lisbon, where he died within a short time. His wife eventually reached India, but died of cholera in Calcutta, where she was buried on 10 December 1782.<br>
