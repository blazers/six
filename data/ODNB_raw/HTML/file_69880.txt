<span class="headword">Foss,  Josephine</span>  (1887&#150;1983), <span class="occ">missionary teacher and welfare worker in Asia</span>, was born on 19 March 1887 at Eastleigh, Dingwall Road, Croydon, the sixth child of Frederick Foss (1850&#150;1908), solicitor, and his wife, Anne Penny Bartrum (1853&#150;1924). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33214/', "Hubert James Foss (1899&#150;1953)")</script> was a younger brother. After training as a teacher at the Froebel Institute, specializing in science subjects, she taught for seven years in London and Lancashire before training to become a missionary at St Denys College, Warminster. Early in 1914 she was appointed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) to teach elementary science, nature study, and craft at two schools in Peking (Beijing). She travelled from Berlin to Vladivostok by the Trans-Siberian Railway, having to show her baptism certificate in tsarist Russia because of their current persecution of Jews. Once in China she had to learn to speak and read Mandarin. After a year of intense tuition and much practice with the children in her hostel, she was able to teach elementary physics in Chinese to the boys. Having survived a virulent strain of tuberculosis, she struggled to open kindergartens and clinics in rural areas, carrying bones and crusts of bread in her pockets for the pariah dogs that were at first set on her as &#145;a blue-eyed Devil&#146;.<br>
<br>Foss returned on furlough to Europe in 1919 and had to be treated in Switzerland for her tuberculosis. Peking was judged too unhealthy for her and she was sent to Natal (1921&#150;4), to teach English and teaching method to Zulu boys, including the future bishop of Zululand. In 1924 the SPG sent her to St Mary's Anglican School in Kuala Lumpur. In the backstreets of Kuala Lumpur she discovered a primitive school for the children of the Chinese poor, run over shop fronts by an elderly, frail English lady, Miss Elinor Edith Gage Brown (<i>d</i>. 1926). In 1925 Josephine Foss took over when Miss Brown went back to England to die and immediately found herself struggling for government backing for her Pudu English School for Girls. &#145;But money, how much I wanted and how little I got&#146;  (memoirs, 30). She was allowed to move the site of the school to undrained wasteland near an old tin mine crater and, thanks to donations from the local Chinese, the first kindergarten, primary, and secondary classes for girls in Malaya began. She also established a boarding-house for rural girls&#151;Chinese, Indian, Ceylonese, Dutch, and English&#151;though not Malay Muslims because of their dietary restrictions. They were not all Christians, but Miss Foss did not think that mattered. She also initiated a Girl Guide movement, did local welfare work among lepers and battered children, and found herself the <i>de facto</i> adoptive mother of several abandoned illegitimate little daughters of prostitutes. In 1935 she was made MBE for services to education. Her girls became the first women doctors, nurses, matrons, accountants, therapists, teachers, and lawyers in Malaya, and her Pudu School eventually grew to have more than 1000 pupils.<br>
<br>After the Japanese invasion of Malaya in 1941 Foss was evacuated to Singapore. When Singapore fell she and the remaining British women were marched to Changi prison camp. She was interned for three and a half years, keeping up her own and her fellow prisoners' spirits, organizing work parties and clandestine meetings of husbands and wives. She endured punishment and interrogation as well as sickness and the endemic acute hunger. After the war the Colonial Office sent her an official commendation for the exceptional services she had rendered to her comrades in captivity. On her release she was too ill and weak to walk; she had lost almost all her hair as well as 5 stone. But former pupils from Pudu found her and cherished her back to the beginnings of renewed health.<br>
<br>Foss recovered slowly in post-war Britain and applied to return to Malaya, only to be told by the SPG that the bishop of Singapore (John Leonard Wilson) refused to have her back. Perhaps this was because it was no longer possible under Malayanization to have a European as headmistress, or because she had not minded that so many of her girls were not Christian. Determined to save for her fare to return independently, she went back to South Africa to teach Zulu girls for a year in Natal. She later learned that her girls' school was declared a &#145;whites-only&#146; area by the Nationalist government and all the Africans forcibly displaced.<br>
<br>In July 1948 Foss returned to Singapore. No longer a headmistress, she had new work, training the first generation of Malaya's welfare officers. She went to hospitals, orphanages, leper settlements, and gaols and personally demonstrated the harmlessness of being a blood donor. But once the emergency of the communist insurgency began in Malaya, the government used her as an interpreter for Mandarin in the courts that were trying young Chinese suspects. She then had to trace and reunite the families of the communists willing to be repatriated to mainland China. As well as Mandarin she could speak Malay, and more than a smattering of Cantonese, Hakka, and Japanese. (In Natal she had also coped with the click language of the Zulu.) She was much happier doing welfare work again after the emergency, organizing campaigns against malaria and yaws and taking salt, clothes, and medicines by jeep and canoe, and on foot through the jungle, to inaccessible Malay villages. From 1952 she undertook parish work in Ipoh and taught in a boys' school there until 1954, when she went to teach at St Thomas's boys' school in Kuching, Sarawak.<br>
<br>Josephine Foss returned to England in 1958, and taught Malay and Mandarin to English people and English to foreigners&#151;above all to the Japanese. &#145;I was determined to teach Japanese ladies to show that I had no permanent hate against them&#146;  (memoirs). She died at her home, 2 Broadlands Road, Highgate, London, on 23 July 1983.<br>
