<span class="headword">Derrick,  Samuel</span>  (1724&#150;1769), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in Dublin; his family had held land near Carlow, but had lost it as a result of the disturbances of the seventeenth century. Derrick was apprenticed to a linen draper, but fled to London to become an actor, at which he was unsuccessful. He therefore turned his hand to writing, publishing a number of works, notably <span class="italic">The dramatic censor; being remarks upon the conduct, characters, and catastrophe of our most celebrated plays</span> (1752); <span class="italic">A Voyage to the Moon</span> (1753), translated from the work by Cyrano de Bergerac; <span class="italic">The Battle of Lora</span> (1762), attributed to Ossian; and an edition of Dryden, <span class="italic">Works, with a Life and Notes</span> (1760). He also published a collection of his letters, entitled <span class="italic">Letters Written from Leverpoole, Chester, Corke &hellip;</span> (1767), in two volumes, with his portrait included as a frontispiece. His association with the theatre continued in spite of his acting failures, and he contributed the prologue to a production of <span class="italic">The Miser</span> performed on 17 December 1756 as a benefit for raising money for &#145;friendless and deserted boys for the Sea&#146;. On a number of occasions since the early nineteenth century Derrick has been wrongly identified as the author of <span class="italic">A General View of the Stage</span> (1759), a work published by a Mr Wilkes. The true author of this work, the Dublin-based Thomas Wilkes (<i>d</i>. 1786), was known to Derrick, who also praised Wilkes's writing on the theatre in his <span class="italic">Poetical Dictionary</span> (1761). A comparison of <span class="italic">View of the Stage</span> and Derrick's own <span class="italic">Remarks upon the Tragedy of Venice Preserved</span> (1752) shows that sections of the earlier work were used by Wilkes.<br>
<br>For a time in the 1750s or 1760s Derrick lived with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39771/', "Jane Lessingham (1738/9&#150;1783)")</script> as his wife, although she was already married. He was acquainted with both Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, whose opinion of him was somewhat ambivalent. Johnson, while having &#145;a kindness&#146; for him, on being asked which was the finer poet, Derrick or Christopher Smart, replied that there was &#145;no settling the point of precedency between a louse and a flea&#146;  (Boswell, 272, 1214). Boswell, though an associate of Derrick during his first trip to London in 1760, later turned against this &#145;little blackguard pimping dog&#146;  (28 March 1763, <span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal, 1762&#150;3</span>, ed. F. A. Pottle, 1950).<br>
<br>In January 1763 Derrick succeeded James Collet (Jacques Colet) as master of ceremonies at Bath and Tunbridge Wells, an appointment which Johnson attributed less to his social skills than to his being a &#145;literary man&#146;  (Boswell, 327). Some have suggested that his appointment was originally intended as a joke, and <span class="italic">The New Bath Guide</span> for 1798 reports that Derrick kept the position &#145;notwithstanding great opposition&#146;. Certainly his reputation suffered during the nostalgic reminiscences which followed the death in 1761 of Bath's greatest master, Beau Nash, compared to whom Derrick was &#145;so small and pusillanimous in his appearance, that it was next to impossible for him to command respect&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Original Bath Guide</span>, 1811, 97). To others, by the very nature of his position he embodied the triviality of Bath society, being a &#145;puny monarch&#146; in Tobias Smollett's <span class="italic">Humphrey Clinker</span>  (1771, letter of 6 May), and &#145;an insignificant puppy&#146; to the Cornish visitor John Penrose. None the less, as <span class="italic">The New Bath Guide</span> for 1766 suggests, Derrick did enjoy popularity among the company, if never that of Nash in his prime; Penrose's criticism, for example, followed a benefit ball which raised &pound;150 for the master, while more impressionable visitors looked favourably on a man described by Smollett's Lydia Melford as &#145;so sweet, so fine, so civil, and polite, that in our country he might pass for the prince of Wales&#146;  (letter of 26 April). Derrick lost or squandered an inheritance in 1755, and died in Bath on 28 March 1769. A compilation entitled <span class="italic">Derrick's Jests, or, The Wits Chronicle</span> was published soon after.<br>
