<span class="headword">Purton,  William</span>  (1784&#150;1825), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and teacher of stenography</span>, is of unknown parentage and education. At the time of his death, about Christmas 1825, he was married to Mary Gimler Purton and resided at Pleasant Row, Winchester Street, Pentonville, London. He was buried at Elim (Baptist) Chapel, Fetter Lane, Holborn.<br>
<br>At his school near Pentonville, Purton taught to a few selected students a system of shorthand, possibly of his own invention, that, as later practised by two of those students and their own pupils, became one of seven systems used in parliament and the Supreme Court of Judicature in the nineteenth century. Purton's system, unmentioned in nineteenth-century histories or bibliographies of shorthand and unpublished until 1888, should perhaps be called &#145;the Purton system as improved by Oxford and Hodges&#146;  (Hodges, 26), after the two students who developed it for their own use in the law courts, Thomas Oxford and John George Hodges. Apparently Hodges never divulged the name of their teacher; his son, also John George Hodges, himself an adept practitioner of the Purton system in the law courts, gave credit to Alexander Tremaine Wright for &#145;extracting&#146; this information from the elderly Thomas Oxford  (Hodges, 25).<br>
<br>On 16 October 1843 the elder John George Hodges, aged thirty-six, was sent to Dublin as a government shorthand writer during the repeal agitation, to record meetings of and speeches made by members of the Loyal National Repeal Association. He also recorded the trials of Daniel O'Connell, William Smith O'Brien, Thomas Francis Meagher, and John Mitchel. The accuracy of his transcribed notes was praised by both sides of the bench. The facility and accuracy with which John George Hodges senior employed the Purton system were also displayed by his son, who recorded the celebrated cases <i>Small v. Attwood</i> and <i>Swinfen v. Lord Chelmsford</i>, as well as complicated cases involving patent infringements and the Metropolitan Board of Works.<br>
