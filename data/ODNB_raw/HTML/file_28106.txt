<span class="headword">Vansittart,  Robert</span>  (1728&#150;1789), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 28 December 1728 at Great Ormond Street, London, the second son of Arthur van Sittart (1691&#150;1760), merchant, of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, and his wife, Martha, eldest daughter of Sir John Stonhouse, baronet, of Radley, Berkshire, comptroller of the household to Queen Anne. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28103/', "Henry Vansittart (1732&#150;1770?)")</script> governor of Bengal, was his younger brother.<br>
<br>Vansittart was educated at Reading School and at Winchester College. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 3 April 1745, was elected a fellow of All Souls College in 1748, and graduated BCL in 1751 and DCL in 1757. In 1753 he was called to the bar by the society of the Inner Temple. On 17 May 1760 he was nominated high steward of Monmouth, in 1763 recorder of Maidenhead, in 1764 recorder of Newbury, and in 1770 recorder of Windsor. In 1767 he was appointed by the crown regius professor of civil law in the University of Oxford, a post he held until his death. For some years before his appointment he performed the duties of public orator for his predecessor, Robert Jenner.<br>
<br>Vansittart was a close friend of the painters George Knapton and William Hogarth, as well as of the poets Paul Whitehead and William Cowper. In Italy he met Goethe, who named a character in one of his comedies after him. Through the classical scholar Joseph Warton, Vansittart became a friend of Dr Johnson, who regarded him with much affection, and who was invited to visit India with him by his brother Henry. In 1759, in a festive moment, Dr Johnson, while on a visit to Oxford, proposed that they should scale the walls of All Souls together; but Vansittart declined. On another occasion, while Vansittart was edifying Boswell with a lengthy story about a flea, Johnson burst in with &#145;It is a pity, sir, that you have not seen a lion; for a flea has taken you such a time that a lion must have served you for a twelve-month&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.194).<br>
<br>Vansittart, who was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 4 June 1767, undertook antiquarian pursuits in his spare time. In the year of his election he edited <span class="italic">Certain Ancient Tracts Concerning the Management of Landed Property</span>, which consisted of reprints of Gentian Hervet's translation <span class="italic">Xenophon's Treatise of the Householde</span> (1534), and Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's <span class="italic">Boke of Husbandry</span> (1534) and <span class="italic">Surveyinge</span> (1539).<br>
<br>Vansittart was a man of licentious and debauched habits and, like his brother Henry, was a member of the &#145;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71306', "Franciscans of Medenham")</script>&#146;. To this society he presented with great pomp a baboon sent from India by Henry, to which Sir Francis Dashwood was accustomed to administer the eucharist at their meetings. As a young man, he was painted by Hogarth wearing a kerchief in the colours of the &#145;Franciscans&#146;, wound in turban fashion over the head, embroidered with the motto &#145;Love and Friendship&#146;. On 23 August 1773 Mrs Thrale described Vansittart to Johnson as &#145;very ill and very wild, I fancy he wants a governess&#146;  (Redford, 2.113).<br>
<br>Vansittart died at Oxford, unmarried, on 31 January 1789, and was buried in a vault in the chapel of All Souls College. He was tall and very thin, and the members of the Oxford bar gave the name of Counsellor Van to a sharp-pointed rock on the River Wye from a fancied resemblance  (Bloomfield, 23).<br>
