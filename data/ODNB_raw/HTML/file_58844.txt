<span class="headword">Russell,  Hastings William Sackville</span>, twelfth duke of Bedford  (1888&#150;1953), <span class="occ">evangelical Christian and pacifist</span>, was born on 21 December 1888 at Cairnsmore House, Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35882/', "Lord Herbrand Arthur Russell, later eleventh duke of Bedford (1858&#150;1940)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35884/', "Mary Du Caurroy Russell (1865&#150;1937)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35882/', "Russell, Herbrand Arthur")</script>], daughter of the Ven. W. H. Tribe, archdeacon of Lahore. His childhood was lonely. His father was forbidding, aloof, and autocratic; his mother (the famous Flying Duchess, who was to take up aviation in her sixties) was deaf, short-tempered, and dismissive of anything short of perfection. He shared, however, his parents' interest in wildlife, and was later to produce publications on birds of the parrot family.<br>
<br>In 1893, when his father became duke, Russell took the courtesy title of marquess of Tavistock. At Eton College (1905&#150;7) he was bullied and unhappy. At Balliol College, Oxford (1907&#150;11), where he obtained a fourth in history, he developed the strong evangelical Christian beliefs that were to dominate the rest of his life. In 1912, at his father's wish, he joined the Middlesex regiment but, hating the experience, resigned his commission. At the outbreak of the First World War he refused to rejoin the regiment, and his father disinherited him; they did not see each other again for twenty years. Through Robert Whitwell, an Oxford don interested in the YMCA, he became in 1914 a helper at a camp near Portsmouth, where he worked for five years (his bad eyesight saving him from military service). On 21 November 1914 he married Whitwell's daughter, Louisa Crommelin Roberta Jowitt (1893&#150;1960). They were to have two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>From 1919 Tavistock immersed himself in Christian and social work. Concerned at the effects of the economic situation, he became a supporter of social credit, on which he wrote extensively. His personal life, meanwhile, suffered. In 1935 he and his wife separated, after a highly public lawsuit in which she had unsuccessfully sued for restoration of conjugal rights; and in 1939 he disinherited his elder son because of what he saw as an unsuitable marriage.<br>
<br>In 1938&#150;9, campaigning against the approaching war, Tavistock became associated with the pro-Nazi and antisemitic fringe, becoming in 1939 president of the openly antisemitic British People's Party (whose programme included monetary reform and peace with Nazi Germany). Its general secretary was John Beckett, co-founder of William Joyce's National Socialist League. Like many pre-war pacifists Tavistock may have acted through na&iuml;vety; his letters and memoirs betray ignorance of the implications of antisemitism. After the outbreak of war he became chairman of the British Council for a Christian Settlement in Europe, with Beckett as secretary, and also took part, in late 1939, in secret meetings with Oswald Mosley and representatives of other extremist organizations. In January 1940 certain peace proposals were conveyed to him via the German legation in Dublin. Tavistock, despite official scepticism, went to Dublin, and returned with peace terms that were ridiculed by the press, which stressed his &#145;fascist&#146; connections. He remained convinced that a real chance had been thwarted by governmental apathy.<br>
<br>On 27 August 1940 Tavistock succeeded his father as twelfth duke of Bedford. Throughout the war, in numerous pamphlets and in the House of Lords, he continued his peace campaign, attacking Churchill's belligerence, and &#145;the attempt, by the moneylending financiers and big business monopolists, to destroy the relatively sane financial system of the Axis Powers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 2 June 1942). His internment was often demanded (and considered seriously by the war cabinet), but never activated.<br>
<br>After the war, with John Beckett, Bedford revived the British People's Party, drawing in various members of pre-war organizations such as the Imperial Fascist League and the Nordic League; it had little success. On 9 October 1953 he died of gunshot wounds, described by the coroner as accidentally inflicted, on his Endsleigh estate in Devon. After a funeral at Efford, Plymouth, on 14 October, his ashes were interred in the family vault at Chenies, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Described by his son as &#145;the loneliest man I ever knew&#146;  (John, duke of Bedford, 86&#150;7), Bedford appears to have been an unworldly, sincere, but opinionated man, whose na&iuml;vety led him into association with people and ideas that blended ill with his very real Christian ideals.<br>
