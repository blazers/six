<span class="headword">Conder,  (Hugh) Neville</span>  (1922&#150;2003), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 60 Foxley Lane, Purley, Croydon, Surrey, on 30 April 1922, the younger son and third child of John Reynolds Conder, advertising agent, and his wife, Edna Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benson, whose father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46623/', "Samuel Herbert Benson")</script>, founded Britain's first large advertising agency. He was a diffident child, and unhappy at his school, Charterhouse, although when he accidentally discovered copies of the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span> in the library he was entranced and this led him to enrol at the Bartlett School of Architecture, which was based in Cambridge during the Second World War. He later recalled that he was nearly seduced by Albert Richardson's conservative classicism, but after one year he left for service with the RAF. While awaiting call-up he worked on a farm in Devon, where an accident with a gun almost caused the loss of his left arm and made military service impossible. While recuperating he was inspired by modern architecture and resumed his studies at the Architectural Association, forming part of a brilliant wartime generation at the exiled school under Sir Frederick Gibberd that included Philip Powell, (John) Hidalgo Moya, and Geoffry Powell. His skill in drawing and his interest in landscape had been stimulated by finding the books of his ancestor, William Gilpin, in the family library. He realized that if architecture were to achieve true functionalism it needed to respond flexibly and modestly to the site and programme.<br>
<br>Conder's career began in the straitened conditions after the war, with exhibition designs and drawings for publication, including those for <span class="italic">Bombed Churches as War Memorials</span> (1945). On 25 July 1946 he married a 24-year-old fellow architecture student, Jean MacArthur, daughter of Donald Hector Colin MacArthur, of the Royal Army Medical Corps. They had one son and one daughter. After his marriage Conder continued designing and writing. He wrote a short <span class="italic">Introduction to Modern Architecture</span> (1949) for the publishers Art and Technics, which was the beginning of his contact with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72656/', "Hugh Casson")</script>, the editor of the series. When Casson's partner Christopher Nicholson was killed in a gliding accident in 1948, Conder completed some of the work in hand and, working with Patience Clifford, he contributed to the South Bank exhibition for the Festival of Britain of 1951. In 1953 Casson was appointed professor of environmental design at the Royal College of Art, and while continuing in practice and specializing in interiors, tended to delegate most of his architectural design work. The two men shared the same office space, but the practice of Casson, Conder &amp; Partners was only formalized in 1956. The collaboration was fruitful, with Casson's understanding of planning strategies and client relationships complementing and overlapping Conder's design skills. Casson was a public figure, and outsiders assumed that he was at least part-author of the projects, when in fact Conder's share of the work at all levels was much greater, in conjunction with the associates Ronald Green, Michael Cain, and Timothy Rendle. Green wrote that Conder &#145;maintained a keen guardianship over the character and nature of the practice while steering it into mainstream architecture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>, 26 June 2003).<br>
<br>In 1952 Casson and Conder were selected as master planners for a new arts faculty for Cambridge University (the Sidgwick site), their proposal for an accretive and asymmetrical scheme having acknowledged what Conder called &#145;the paradox that it was unlikely [all] to be built&#146; so that &#145;it was less noticeable if a bit was missing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). The scale of the three-sided &#145;raised faculty&#146; building was determined by comparison with the historic courts of Cambridge colleges, and views were opened through and across the site. The elevations in stone and brick were carefully considered in terms of weathering. In 1984 Conder returned to build the new classics department and museum. At Birmingham University in 1958 he planned the future of a large site, including the Vale, with a new lake in the manner of an eighteenth-century landscape park, and the staff house, with its fine staircase. His George VI Memorial Hostel in Holland Park, on the site of the bombed Holland House, was originally painted in two shades of khaki to disguise its presence. In 1961 he planned and partly built the Children's Village at Sedlescombe, Sussex, for the Pestalozzi Children's Village Trust (the only such village built in Britain by the war orphans' charity), and he later became involved in the life of the organization.<br>
<br>Conder later claimed that he had introduced rough concrete, as favoured by the &#145;New Brutalists&#146; in the Festival of Britain, and tried to build the Lady Mitchell Hall (the lecture theatre at the front of the Cambridge arts faculty site) in ribbed bush-hammered concrete before it became a fashionable architectural treatment. Two well-known buildings of 1965 used a ribbed surface, the National Westminster Bank in King Street, Manchester, and the elephant and rhino house at London Zoo, the latter being an instance where the mercurial Casson was more or less forced by his partner to produce the design. Among the major projects of later years were the Derby civic centre (1971&#150;6) and the Wyvern Theatre, Swindon (1975). In 1972 he planned the Pulteney weir at Bath, a sensitive site in the centre of the historic city, where he created a beautiful elliptical shape, although the full scheme was not completed. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce in 1967, on 5 February 1970 he married Susan Ruth Heller, a 24-year-old teacher (later plantswoman and counsellor), and daughter of Philip Heller, building contractor. With his second wife he had a further son and daughter.<br>
<br>Conder's design for the Ismaili Centre in South Kensington (1977&#150;83) filled an awkward triangular site near his office and home, and showed a deep understanding of and sensitivity to the requirements of the brief and the neighbourhood, learning how to modify western assumptions in architecture and reinterpret them in Islamic terms while avoiding the effect of &#145;a Sheraton in Kuwait&#146;  (<span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span>, 30 November 1983). The granite cladding was made &#145;in a light and card like manner&#146; and the windows of the first floor social hall faceted and chamfered to conceal the people inside. For his client, the Aga Khan, he also built racing stables in Ireland.<br>
<br>Conder was a member of the council of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and its vice-president in 1976. He was appointed CBE in 1986. In retirement he lived at 49 Thurloe Square, South Kensington, but spent much time in Sussex, painting the landscape in a romantic and intuitive manner. He died at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, on 20 June 2003, following a heart attack, and was survived by his wife, Susan, and his four children.<br>
