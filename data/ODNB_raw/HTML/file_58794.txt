<span class="headword">Godfrey, Sir  Daniel Eyers <span class="st"> [Dan]</span></span>  (1868&#150;1939), <span class="occ">conductor</span>, was born on 20 June 1868 in Winchester Street, Pimlico, London, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33429/', "Lieutenant Daniel Godfrey (1831&#150;1903)")</script> and his wife, Joyce Boyles (who died in 1890 after a paralytic stroke). As well as a younger brother he had three sisters. The family was famous for producing three generations of bandmasters. Dan Godfrey was educated between 1880 and 1884 at King's School, the Strand, but his studies were cut short because of suspected eye trouble. He then toured Germany with a commercial career in mind and to learn the language, but on his return decided that music offered better prospects and accordingly enrolled at the Royal College of Music (1885&#150;7), studying first the violin and then the clarinet under Henry Lazarus. After leaving the college, in the hope of succeeding his father as bandmaster of the Grenadier Guards, he studied band instrumentation with John Hartmann, an acknowledged expert, and started making some arrangements and composing small pieces of his own. In 1889 he succeeded his cousin Charles Godfrey (1866&#150;1935) as bandmaster of the corps of commissionaires. In 1890 he gained his bandmaster's diploma at the Royal Academy of Music but because he had not passed through Kneller Hall, the bandmasters' training school, a service appointment was not open to him. He accepted instead the conductorship of the London military band, a municipal ensemble that had been established after the War Office had prohibited military bands from performing outside their own regimental districts. He also took over his father's orchestral work, which included conducting at fashionable balls and exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1891&#150;2 he toured South Africa, as music director first of the Standard Opera Company and then of the Globe Burlesque Company. There he met Jessie Stuart (1870&#150;1925), daughter of a civil servant in Pietermaritzburg, whom he married in Durban on 19 September 1892. They sailed back to England in October.<br>
<br>In January 1893 Dan Godfrey found among his father's unanswered correspondence a request from Bournemouth to supply a band of thirty players for the reopening of the Winter Gardens. He applied for the position himself and was contracted for a five-month summer season. &#145;Dan Godfrey's Band&#146; made its first appearance on Whit Monday 1893 and was so successful that he negotiated first for the winter and then for successive seasons: Bournemouth became his home for life.<br>
<br>With his band, employed to play on the pier, on the lawns, and inside the Winter Gardens, Godfrey gradually introduced serious music, adding strings so that by October he was giving classical concerts in addition to his other duties. In December 1894 he inaugurated the first of his forty annual series of winter symphony concerts with which he was able to realize his ambition of making Bournemouth a home for British music where both established and young composers could be sure of a hearing. Composers were frequently invited to conduct their own works. In May 1894 he was officially appointed musical director and adviser and entertainment manager to the corporation and in May 1896 the band became the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra, the first permanent, fully salaried, municipal orchestra in the country, with Godfrey as its musical director.<br>
<br>In May 1911 the leading British composers of the day held a dinner in London in Godfrey's honour and Sir Charles Stanford toasted him as &#145;the greatest friend of the British composer&#146;  (Godfrey, <span class="italic">Memories and Music</span>, 83) since Sir August Manns, whose Crystal Palace concerts had been an example to Godfrey. In 1922 Dame Ethel Smyth campaigned vigorously on Godfrey's behalf for a knighthood, which was conferred on him in July by King George V. The following year Godfrey wrote his autobiography, <span class="italic">Memories and Music</span>.<br>
<br>In 1922 he gave the first of the famous Bournemouth Easter festivals that continued until 1929 when the orchestra moved from the Winter Gardens to the newly built pavilion. With the separate appointment of a general manager Godfrey found himself increasingly at odds with the corporation's attitude towards serious music and his later years were not so happy now that he had lost overall control. Nevertheless, both he and the orchestra reached a wider audience and gained further recognition through the weekly national broadcasts of his symphony concerts from the pavilion.<br>
<br>In 1925 Lady Godfrey died from heart failure. Sir Dan remarried in 1929; his second wife was Mrs Annie Farlam from Buxton. There had been three sons and three daughters from the first marriage. The eldest son, Daniel Stuart (1893&#150;1935), at one time seen as a successor to his father and known&#151;as his father had once been&#151;as Dan Godfrey jun., was a music director for the BBC (1923&#150;6) before being appointed conductor of the Durban Municipal Orchestra in 1928. In April 1935 he died there suddenly from a heart attack.<br>
<br>Sir Dan Godfrey retired in 1934 and was succeeded by Richard Austin. In 1937 he revisited South Africa, where he had some conducting engagements. He died at Bournemouth on 20 July 1939 and was buried at St Peter's Church, Bournemouth, on 24 July 1939. As a conductor his appearances outside Bournemouth were few, largely because of the corporation's restrictive policy. Over the years with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra he had made a number of recordings of popular orchestral works, and in 1931 a short film was made of him conducting in the pavilion. In 1926 with the London Symphony Orchestra he made the first complete gramophone recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams's <span class="italic">A London Symphony</span>, a work with which he was particularly associated. On the rostrum he was, in the words of a local critic, &#145;a stern disciplinarian [who] would not tolerate scamped or careless work&#146;, and he was occasionally abrupt or gruff in manner. Though outspoken at times, he lacked neither warmth nor friendliness. He liked to quote the verdict of his long-serving timpanist: &#145;He's hot stuff, but he's just!&#146;  (Godfrey, <span class="italic">Memories and Music</span>, 77). He was modest and without prejudice. His repertory, while not admitting the Second Viennese school, was otherwise extraordinarily catholic, with a particular fondness for Russian music. His workload was unequalled and his interpretations were widely respected. His name today rightly rests upon his championing of British music and his founding of today's Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.<br>
