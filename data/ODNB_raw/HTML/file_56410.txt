<span class="headword">Overs,  John A.</span>  (1808&#150;1844), <span class="occ">author and cabinet-maker</span>, was born in Birmingham, the eldest of the three sons of Richard Overs (1778&#150;1851) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mykins 
    (or Meakins; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1814)
  . His father was descended from a staunchly Roman Catholic family of copyholders in the manor of Knowle, with a family home at Chesset Wood. The home that he inherited on the death of his brother Charles was heavily mortgaged, yet Richard Overs managed to pay off the debts through business interests which are now, unfortunately, unrecorded&#151;he is described only as &#145;yeoman&#146; at the Knowle Manor court. John Overs's two brothers died when he was five, and his mother died a year later. Richard Overs remarried, but there is no evidence of any further children before his second wife died.<br>
<br>John Overs was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker, and slowly rose through the profession. He harboured dreams of being recognized as a writer, however: a manuscript notebook of his poetry from the 1820s is extant, including some striking love poems to his fianc&eacute;e. On 4 August 1828 John Overs married Amelia Horton (<i>d</i>. 1885), the eighth of the fourteen children of Daniel Horton, a gold-cutter who had lived near the centre of Birmingham, and his wife, Mary Wilkinson. This marriage caused a rift in the family, as Amelia was an Anglican; John Overs's father disowned him, and continued to remain distant from the family, even after his son's death.<br>
<br>By 1834 John Overs and Amelia were living in Hoxton, London. Overs was working as a cabinet-maker, but continued to educate himself and to write in his spare time. He acquired several influential friends who assisted him in his attempts to publish his poetry and short stories. Charles Dickens, in particular, provided him with feedback on his writing, with introductions to newspaper editors, and with practical and financial assistance when Overs became seriously ill. Overs first wrote to Dickens in January 1839, hoping to have some poetry placed in <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>. Dickens, who had just resigned as editor of the publication, thought several of Overs's pieces were rather fine. He went on to recommend them to his successor, and continued to correspond with Overs, recommending his writing to editors in his circle, reading and commenting on his work, and even going so far as to meet him:<blockquote>I have &hellip; sat down to alter your story. I find it, however, almost an impossible job without having you at my elbow &hellip; If you can be with me at <i>12 exactly</i> next Sunday, I can spare an hour and a half, and I have no doubt that will be quite sufficient for our purpose. (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 2.19)</blockquote>They corresponded on other matters as well: on one occasion, Dickens sent Overs a copy of Carlyle's <span class="italic">Chartism</span>, with the aim of obtaining a working man's view of the work, and Overs wrote back, giving his opinion of its strengths and weaknesses.<br>
<br>Dickens also assisted Overs when he became ill. He sent him &pound;5 on at least three occasions, arranged for his friend Dr John Elliotson to provide treatment, and in the autumn of 1841, when Overs's lung complaint became too grave for him to continue as a cabinet-maker, even found him a job as an administrator in William Macready's new Drury Lane Theatre. This latter assistance led to some friction between the two men, as Overs was dissatisfied with his working conditions and salary&#151;the letters to him from Dickens at this time are quite heated, and interesting for their condemnation of Overs's ostensible tendency to &#145;vaunt [his] independence too much, and to flourish it rather unnecessarily in the eyes of a stranger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 2.408). After a remonstrative letter from Overs, Dickens calmed down, and continued to offer him assistance, for instance in recommending him as a writer to Murdo Young, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Sun Newspaper</span>.<br>
<br>Perhaps more importantly, however, Dickens advised Overs on the publication <span class="italic">Evenings of a Working Man</span> (1844), and wrote the preface to the work. This collection was dedicated to Dr Elliotson, and contains one story, &#145;The carpenter&#146;, which bears signs of a response to W. H. Ainsworth's advice that Overs should write from his own experience. In his preface Dickens is careful to emphasize Overs's autonomy, stating that although he had given advice to the author on this collection of short pieces, he &#145;never altered them, otherwise than by recommending condensation now and then&#146;, and assuring the reader that the volume's sketches represented Overs's &#145;genuine work, as they have been his sober and rational amusement&#146;. Dickens described him as &#145;a simple, frugal, steady, upright, honourable man&#146; who had &#145;risen superior to the mere prejudices of [his] class &hellip; without losing his sympathy for all their real wrongs and grievances&#146;. He also calls upon the reader to sympathize with Overs in his ill health and to recognize that the publication of the volume was largely motivated by the desire to make &#145;some temporary provision for his sick wife and very young family&#146;  (Dickens, preface, <span class="italic">Evenings of a Working Man</span>). Overs was paid &pound;25 for the book by T. C. Newby, the publisher whom Dickens had recommended; the money went through Dickens's account, and was forwarded to Overs by him. The book ran into two editions.<br>
<br>John Overs died at 55 Vauxhall Street, Lambeth, London, on 28 September 1844. According to Dickens:<blockquote>When poor Overs was dying he suddenly asked for a pen and ink and some paper, and made up a little parcel for me which it was his last conscious act to direct. She [Amelia Overs] told me this and gave it me. I opened it last night. It was a copy of his little book in which he had written my name, &#145;With his devotion.&#146; I thought it simple and affecting of the poor fellow. (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 4.240)</blockquote>John Overs was given a pauper's burial in a public grave, no. 576, West Norwood cemetery, London.<br>
<br>Dickens was out of the country at the time of Overs's death, and so it was T. C. Newby who arranged for a subscription to be taken up for the relief of Overs's destitute widow and six children (Amelia, John Richard, Harriet, Geraldine, Editha, and John). Newby himself gave &pound;20 and, among other contributions, Amelia and her children received &pound;25 from the Royal Literary Fund, after recommendations from Newby, Elliotson, and D. A. Mullock. Dickens interested Angela Burdett Coutts in the case of Overs's family, and she sent Amelia &#145;at different times, sixteen pounds &hellip; sent a doctor to her children, and &hellip; got one of the girls into the Orphan School&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 4.293). Help from Overs's friends enabled Amelia Overs to set up in a &#145;small millinery and fancy stationery business&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 24 May 1845) at 16 Carthusian Street, Charterhouse Square. In February 1846 she married Robert John King, a bookbinder and widower. They lived in London for the rest of their lives; Amelia King died in 1885.<br>
