<span class="headword">Townley,  James</span>  (1774&#150;1833), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and religious writer</span>, was born on 11 May 1774 in Manchester, the son of Thomas Townley, a local businessman. His mother, Mary, a devout churchwoman, was also an occasional attender at Methodist meetings. Townley was educated in Macclesfield by the evangelical incumbent, the Revd David Simpson (1745&#150;1799), whose death and funeral deeply affected the young man. He joined the Wesleyan Methodists in 1790, giving up a promising career in the cotton industry in 1796 to become an itinerant preacher. According to his biographer, Townley was a sensitive and able minister, adept at resolving problems, clearing debts, and strengthening churches  (Hoole, 323). Even the acerbic James Everett, no friend to the Wesleyan establishment, commented on Townley's &#145;steady piety; acceptable pulpit talents; &hellip; [and] deep sympathy&#146;  (Everett, 345). His name was canvassed unsuccessfully for the post of connexional editor in 1824 in succession to Jabez Bunting, but three years later he was appointed general secretary of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, retaining this position until his retirement. Elected president of the Wesleyan Methodist conference at Sheffield in 1829, his year of office took a heavy toll on his health, and he was compelled to retire as a minister in 1832.<br>
<br>Townley steadily established a reputation within Methodism for biblical, historical, and linguistic scholarship. He was a member of the Manchester Philological Society founded by Adam Clarke, and his published works included the three-volume <span class="italic">Illustrations of Biblical Literature</span> (1821) and a critical edition of Maimonides's <span class="italic">Mose nevochim</span> (1827). A projected history of Christian missions was never completed, and bore fruit only in four articles published posthumously in the <span class="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</span> in 1834. His academic and literary achievements were recognized in the award of a DD by Princeton in 1822.<br>
<br>Townley was married twice. His first wife, Mary Marsden (1770&#150;1827), to whom he was married in September 1798, came from a prominent Methodist family in London and was admitted to the Methodist society at the age of seven by John Wesley. Memoirs of her parents, John and Hannah Marsden, written by Townley, were published in the <span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span> in 1808. The eldest of the Townleys' eight children died in 1823, and Mary Townley herself died in 1827. His second wife was Dinah Ball, also of London. After an extended period of ill health, James Townley died in retirement at Ramsgate on 12 December 1833.<br>
