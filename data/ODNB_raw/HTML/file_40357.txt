<span class="headword">Robertson,  Christina Jane</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Regina Christina Stewart; <em>performing name </em>Jeannie Robertson]</span>  (1908&#150;1975), <span class="occ">folk-singer</span>, was born on 17 April 1908 at March Lane, Jack's Brae, Aberdeen, the daughter of Donald Stewart (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1870), a pedlar, and his wife, Maria Stewart (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;<i>c</i>.1950). She was the youngest child in a family of three sons and two daughters. On both sides of her family she was of Scots traveller stock. As in generations long past, she absorbed her&#151;largely oral&#151;cultural birthright around &#145;summer walker&#146; campfires and meeting-grounds and at the family's winter quarters, which were in Aberdeen. Her father, &#145;Sodjer&#146; (Soldier) Donald&#151;a byname distinguishing him from other Donalds in the interbred Cameron, Croll (or Croall), MacPhee, Robertson, and Stewart clans&#151;died during military service while she was still a baby. Her mother subsequently married James Higgins.<br>
<br>At school in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, aged six, Jeannie, as she was known, first met Donald &#145;Donty&#146; Higgins (1907&#150;1971), the eldest son of Jim and Christina Higgins, whom she would later marry. Fourteen months older than Jeannie, he was Maria Stewart's great-nephew. As they were closely related, their paths crossed periodically. After the death of his first wife, moreover, Donty's father married Jeannie's elder sister, Lizzie Ann. In 1927 they decided to marry. Marriage to Jeannie would make Donty both son and brother-in-law of his father; but since there were several similar relationships in the immediate family alone, it raised few eyebrows at the time, even if the spectre of incest disquieted her biographers. For whatever reason, the couple eloped and were married at St Mary's Cathedral in Aberdeen on 3 September 1927. Donty's trade was recorded as &#145;pedlar&#146; on the marriage certificate, but he would have described himself as a tinker. By then Jeannie had adopted another name&#151;following a common practice within traveller circles&#151;and she married as Christina Jane Robertson. She was a Roman Catholic by baptism and schooling, and remained one all her life, even though mass and sacrament figured little in her religiosity.<br>
<br>According to Robertson's biographers, &#145;Traveller children were brought up in a culture in which songs and tales were not simply entertainment but rather were guides to everyday action&#146;  (Porter and Gower, 14); and she absorbed a sizeable repertory of songs, stories, legend, and lore at her mother's knee, supplementing this with knowledge acquired from an extended circle of family and friends. Marriage brought yet more music, whether singing, ceilidh flings, or Donty's piping, and two children, James 
    (Jeemsie; 1928&#150;1936)
   and Elizabeth Ann 
    (Lizzie; 1929&#150;1993)
  . As a boy Jeemsie showed a gift for ballad singing, whereas Lizzie warmed to her father's piping. (During her own distinguished singing career, despite knowing her mother's repertory inside out, Lizzie preferred to adapt her father's repertory and bagpipe decorations.) At the outbreak of war the family stayed in Aberdeen, but when the air-raids increased they hit the open road, like many traveller families, participants in the last great blossoming of Scots traveller culture in the twentieth century. With a rich vocal timbre and a delivery that sounded right whether heroic or humorous, Robertson was reportedly hailed as the foremost traveller singer up the Dee and down the Don.<br>
<br>In 1953 the Scots folklorist and poet Hamish Henderson heard about Robertson from Bobby Hutchinson, and consequently he collected her songs for the School of Scottish Studies. He put the word out about his &#145;discovery&#146; of a great Scottish folk-singer. In earlier decades Robertson would have been treated as a prodigious, though by no means unique, source cited in song collection footnotes; this had occurred with Miss Bell Robertson (1841&#150;1922) of New Pitsligo in Aberdeenshire, whose feats of memory had irrigated Gavin Greig's <span class="italic">Last Leaves of Traditional Ballads and Ballad Airs</span> (1925). The 1950s, however, were a new age, with Magnacord and Ferrograph tape recorders capable of capturing stylistic nuances and sheer lung capacity; collectors such as Peter Kennedy, Alan Lomax, and Jean Ritchie beat a path to Robertson's door to make recordings.<br>
<br>Having spent most of her adult life as a mother and housewife, Robertson subsequently entered a new phase in her life as a public performer. For someone inured to society's antipathy towards &#145;tinkers&#146;, this represented a cultural wind-shift. For a so-called &#145;simple woman&#146;, Jeannie Robertson rose to the challenge beautifully, deploying all her skills with people, performance, and projection. Over the next ten years record releases on Riverside, Collector, EMI, Topic, Prestige International, and Caedmon labels, as well as radio broadcasts and concerts organized by Norman Buchan and Ewan MacColl, consolidated her reputation.<br>
<br>Robertson had the unforced pace and presence of the natural storyteller, plus the versatility to tailor and vary her delivery as audience, material, or mood required. A performance might unfold briskly, leisurely, or with the sensitivity of an angler tickling in a supper trout. The folk-singer Andy Hunter, who became a kind of adopted son, related how she would pick one of two tunes for &#145;Little Matty Groves&#146; depending on whether the rendition was to be long or short  (Porter and Gower, 77). Her use of verbal consolidations, refrains, and plot reminders captured on record&#151;whether in the &#145;big&#146; ballad &#145;Son David&#146; on <span class="italic">Jeannie Robertson: the World's Greatest Folksinger</span> (1960) or the story &#145;Silly Jack and the Factor&#146; on <span class="italic">Scottish Traditional Tales</span> (2000)&#151;attests to an artistry matured in a less hurried age. She became the most recorded Scots-language speaker in Scottish history  (Porter, 1983); her speech was also peppered with traveller cant.<br>
<br>Hamish Henderson had recognized her talent, but nobody could have guessed the extent of Jeannie Robertson's cultural bounty. She loved the folk revival, and the folk revival loved her. She touched a generation of folk-revivalists such as Martin Carthy, Archie Fisher, Ray Fisher, Andy Hunter, Clive Palmer, Jean Redpath, and Robin Williamson and academics such as Bertrand Bronson and Herschel Gower, and importantly carried the tradition to her kinfolk such as Carmen Higgins, Lizzie Higgins, Nichole Robertson, and Stanley Robertson. Even though she could be highly directive when teaching a song, Robertson was no folk purist. Henderson, when present, often dictated the style of what she sang in public; at home she let her hair down, singing cowboy and yodelling songs, or Harry Lauder's music-hall songs.<br>
<br>Jeannie Robertson was appointed MBE for her services to traditional music in 1968. Long stricken with diabetes, she died of renal failure and renal tuberculosis at her home, 90 Hilton Road, Aberdeen, on 13 March 1975, and was buried in the Trinity cemetery at Pittodrie.<br>
