<span class="headword">Amos, Sir  (Percy) Maurice Maclardie Sheldon</span>  (1872&#150;1940), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at East Street, Gray's Inn Road, London, on 15 June 1872, the eldest child and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/454/', "Sheldon Amos (1835&#150;1886)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50715/', "Sarah Maclardie Amos (1840/41&#150;1908)")</script>, daughter of Thomas Percival Bunting of Manchester. He was educated privately in England but mainly abroad, especially in France and Germany, partly by tutors and partly by his mother. In 1880 he and his younger sister Bont&eacute; went with their parents to Australia for his father's health. Finding the country uncongenial, they set out to return to England. However, when they reached Egypt Sheldon Amos was invited by Lord Dufferin, British adviser to the Porte, to be his legal adviser, and they remained in the country. After Sheldon Amos's death in 1886, his widow and children travelled on the continent. When Maurice Amos was sixteen he spent six months with Sir Flinders Petrie in Egypt at the Hawara pyramid excavation. In 1891 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He had originally intended to read history, but after a talk with Bertrand Russell, who became a lifelong friend, he changed to moral sciences. He gained a first in part one, and spent a semester at T&uuml;bingen to improve his German, and in 1895 he gained a first in part two. His circle of friends at Cambridge included Ralph Vaughan Williams, Ralph Wedgwood, Theodore Llewellyn Davies, and G. E. Moore.<br>
<br>Amos had been admitted a student at the Inner Temple in 1893, was called to the bar in May 1897, and started work as a pupil in conveyancing chambers in Lincoln's Inn. However, he decided to apply for a legal post in Egypt because the family income could not support him through his early years at the bar. He applied to be an inspector in the Egyptian ministry of justice. To qualify to work in the Egyptian mixed courts, he had to learn Arabic and gain the French <i>licence en droit</i>. Once in Egypt, as well as learning his new job he lectured at the Khedival School of Law, Cairo. In 1903 he was appointed a judge in the Cairo native court and in 1906 was promoted to the court of appeal, where he remained for seven years. With his colleague William Brunyate, he successfully countered proposals which would have threatened judicial independence in Egypt. On 11 July 1906 he married Lucy (1880&#150;1958), daughter of Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff and his second wife, Margaret Sturge; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1912 Amos incurred the disapproval of the British community in Cairo by acquitting an Egyptian who had been accused of assaulting a British child. It was felt that he should withdraw from the bench, and in 1913 he became director of the Khedival School of Law. Here he initiated a course of postgraduate studies and proposed the institution of an Egyptian doctorate of laws, but this was vetoed by the sirdar, Lord Kitchener, on political grounds. Amos returned to the court of appeal in 1915. As a judge he attempted, though unsuccessfully, to reform the system of civil procedure and chaired a committee to revise the civil code.<br>
<br>In May 1915 Amos returned to England on leave to join Ralph Wedgwood at the new Ministry of Munitions. Because of his fluent French, he was appointed liaison officer between the ministry and the French military mission in London. In late 1915 Amos was appointed to the War Office to handle the question of priorities in ordering supplies, and in 1916 he became a delegate on an international board to mediate on munitions purchase in America. The following year he was asked to join the Balfour mission to America as a specialist in priority problems.<br>
<br>Amos returned to Egypt in August 1917, where he still held office as a judge, to work again with Sir William Brunyate, by then judicial adviser, as a member of the capitulations commission, which was comprehensively investigating the administration of justice. Despite its extensive work, which was published, the recommendations of the commission came to nothing. Four months later Amos succeeded Brunyate as judicial adviser to the residency, in effect, the minister of justice. In 1921 he advised on treaty negotiations between England and Egypt, but the negotiations failed, and in 1922 the British protectorate was ended. Amos remained in Egypt for another three years as legal adviser. Similarly to his father, who had drafted the constitution of 1882, Maurice Amos helped draft the first constitution of a semi-independent Egypt, and he also dealt with the consequences of British withdrawal.<br>
<br>On his return to England in April 1925 Amos took up practice at the bar, receiving briefs on Egyptian affairs and from the Treasury solicitor as counsel for the British government. He appeared in numerous cases brought under the treaty of Lausanne before the Anglo-Turkish mixed arbitral tribunal at Constantinople. In 1928 he was invited to be Liberal candidate for Cambridge, but came bottom of the poll in the 1929 general election. He was made KBE in 1922 and the following year was allowed to accept the grand cordon of the order of the Nile. He was made king's counsel in 1932 and was awarded an honorary LLD by Lausanne University in 1936.<br>
<br>In 1932 Amos was appointed Quain professor of comparative law and historical jurisprudence at University College, London, thus renewing a family connection with the college through his grandfather Andrew Amos. In 1933 he became senior British representative on the Comit&eacute; International Technique d'Experts Juridiques A&euml;riens, which dealt with international conventions to control air transport.<br>
<br>On retirement from Egypt Amos lived in Cambridge and in Ulpha, near Broughton in Furness, Lancashire. Maurice Amos was a tall, heavily built man, with a vigorous and lively personality and with interests which ranged far outside the law. At heart he was a scholar, who spent his leaves from Egypt being tutored in electromagnetism and mathematics. As well as writing for the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of Comparative Legislation</span>, he helped to found the <span class="italic">Modern Law Review</span>, and contributed reviews and articles to the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. He wrote several books, including <span class="italic">The English Constitution</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Introduction to French Law</span> (with F. P. Walton, 1935), and <span class="italic">Lectures on the American Constitution</span> (1938). He died in Ulverston Cottage Hospital, Ulverston, on 10 June 1940, and was buried at Ulpha. His wife died in 1958.<br>
