<span class="headword">Stratford,  Edward Augustus</span>, second earl of Aldborough  (1733/4&#150;1801), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of the fourteen children of John Stratford (1697&#150;1777), MP for Baltinglass, and his wife, Martha (1706&#150;1796), daughter and coheir of Benjamin O'Neale, archdeacon of Leighlin, co. Carlow. His father was the grandson of Robert Stratford, who came to Ireland before 1660, and is said to have sprung from a younger branch of the Stratfords of Warwickshire. John Stratford was created baron of Baltinglass on 21 May 1763, Viscount Aldborough on 22 July 1776, and Viscount Amiens and earl of Aldborough on 19 February 1777, shortly before his death on 29 June 1777. Edward was educated at Dr Thompson's school in Leixlip before entering Trinity College, Dublin, in December 1751, aged seventeen.<br>
<br>Stratford was widely known for his ability and eccentricity, which caused him to be termed the &#145;Irish Stanhope&#146;. He was elected MP for the family borough of Baltinglass in the Irish House of Commons at a by-election in 1759 and represented the seat until 1768, when he travelled to England. He was an ardent whig, and was elected member for Taunton to the British parliament in 1774, but was unseated with his colleague Nathaniel Webb, on petition, on 16 March 1775, for bribery and corrupt practices. He was returned for Baltinglass again in 1775 and held the seat until his father's death. On 29 May 1777, while still Viscount Amiens, he was elected a member of the Royal Society. On 3 July 1777 the University of Oxford conferred on him the honorary degree of DCL. He built Stratford Place in London and Aldborough House in Dublin, and in Ireland he founded the town of Stratford upon Slaney and greatly improved the borough of Baltinglass. On 29 July 1765 he married Barbara Herbert (1742&#150;1785), only daughter and heir of Nicholas Herbert (<i>d</i>. 1775) of Great Glemham, Suffolk, and his wife, Anne North, and granddaughter of Thomas Herbert, eighth earl of Pembroke. Following her death on 11 April 1785 he married on 24 May 1787 Anne Elizabeth Henniker (<i>d</i>. 1802), only daughter of Sir John Henniker (1724&#150;1803) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1792). She brought him a fortune of &pound;50,000 and considerable expectations, which enabled him to free his estates from encumbrances. There were no children from either marriage.<br>
<br>Aldborough had a consciousness of his recently acquired rank and of what he believed was due to it. The family was probably Cromwellian in origin but he tried to claim an earlier lineage: the Amiens title was supposed to reflect his unsubstantiated descent from one of William the Conqueror's barons. On 15 October 1778 he wrote to Lord Lieutenant Buckinghamshire, who did not personally reply to his letter, that &#145;noblemen will not like being classed with the canaile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, 338), and he appears to have regarded the governorship of the county of Wicklow as a personal fiefdom, saying that he understood that his brother was only his locum tenens. He demanded that the government appoint him immediately as he understood from the secretary's office that there were blank commissions ready to be filled up &#145;as soon as your Lordship pleased to give the orders&#146;  (ibid., 340). He even considered proceeding against his brother in the court of king's bench for disturbing instead of preserving the peace and good order of the county. The government bent to his wishes and appointed him governor of co. Wicklow in December 1778. He was an enthusiastic volunteer and in 1784 was one of the volunteer generals. He was the author of <span class="italic">An Essay on the True Interests of the Empire</span>, published in Dublin in 1783, and he voted in favour of the union with England in 1800.<br>
<br>Aldborough quarrelled with his brothers <i>inter alia</i> over the representation of the family borough of Baltinglass, but he died before the commissioners on 3 July 1801 made their determination over the compensation for the disfranchisement of the borough. One of his brothers, the Revd Francis Paul Stratford, was still unsuccessfully petitioning the commissioners as late as 1 October 1801. A result of these quarrels was his alienation from his immediate heirs of such property as previous settlements permitted. As a parliamentary speaker he was considered by a contemporary to be &#145;tolerable but his manner is pompous&#146; and &#145;both in public and private life, [he] has been uniformly conspicuous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Characters of 1798&#150;1799</span>). Perhaps his most conspicuous action was to conduct an ongoing vendetta against Lord Chancellor Fitzgibbon, which started with his criticism of Fitzgibbon's prosecution of the brutal and reckless George Robert Fitzgerald, and came to a climax when he published an inflammatory pamphlet, in consequence of which Fitzgibbon, now Lord Clare, successfully prosecuted him for libel. Aldborough was fined and briefly imprisoned in Newgate but he was released on 29 March 1798 after a display of contrition and an apology.<br>
<br>Aldborough died on 2 January 1801 at Belan in co. Kildare, and was buried that month in the vault of St Thomas's Church, Dublin. After his death his widow married George Powell in December 1801 and died on 14 July 1802. As Lord Aldborough died without children, his title and estates descended to his brother, John Stratford.<br>
