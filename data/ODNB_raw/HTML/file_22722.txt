<span class="headword">Preston, Sir  Amyas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1609), <span class="occ">naval commander</span>, was a member of the Preston family of Cricket, Somerset. No reference to his birth or education has been found and the earliest reference to him is his marriage on 4 June 1581 to Julian Burye (<i>d</i>. 1614?), widow, of the city of London, at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. In 1588 he took part in the operations against the Spanish Armada, commanding the flotilla of ships' boats sent by Lord Howard to attack the great galleass the <i>San Lorenzo</i>, stranded outside Calais. He is said to have been severely wounded in this fight, although he and his men made sure that the galleass could not take part in the battle again and recompensed themselves by taking anything moveable from the ship. On 23 June 1589, in accordance with regulations intended to prevent the export of iron guns, Preston entered into a bond of &pound;60 to cover the arming of his ship the <i>Julyan Goodspeed</i> with 2 sakers and 6 minions. These regulations were primarily aimed at merchant ships and their captains, some of whom had been accused of arming their ships and then selling the guns once they were in a foreign port. Preston's appearance in a list of captains who had not redeemed their bonds suggests that he may have armed a ship for foreign trade, or perhaps for privateering, on his own account.<br>
<br>In 1595 he led a voyage to the Spanish main together with Sir George Somers. Not even the author of <span class="italic">The Victorious Voyage of Captaine Amias Preston &hellip; and Captaine George Sommer to the West Indies</span> could make this expedition into anything more than a not very successful raiding party. Damage was done to some of the Spanish settlements and the town of Santiago de Le&oacute;n, now known as Caracas, was burnt, but very little plunder was taken back to England after six months at sea.<br>
<br>In 1596 Preston sailed as captain of the <i>Ark</i> under Lord Howard in the Cadiz expedition, and was among the sixty-four men knighted by Howard and the earl of Essex in Cadiz. He is said to have taken part the following year in the attack on the Azores known as the Islands voyage, but the sources differ as to whether he commanded a ship. He seems however to have been associated with court factions surrounding the earl of Essex and the Howard family. About the time of Essex's rebellion, with Ralegh's cousin Sir Ferdinando Gorges, he became involved in a quarrel with Sir Walter Ralegh and allegedly challenged Ralegh to a duel, although no fight seems to have taken place. In 1601 he was vice-admiral under Sir Richard Leveson of the fleet which was commissioned to guard the channel, commanding the <i>Adventure</i> and later the <i>Dreadnought</i>. In the autumn he commanded the <i>Garland</i> as part of the fleet which was detached to defend Kinsale in Ireland against the attempted Spanish invasion, again acting as vice-admiral under Leveson. In the spring of 1602 he succeeded Leveson as admiral in the Irish fleet, commanding the <i>Swiftsure</i>.<br>
<br>Preston was appointed storekeeper to the ordnance on 17 May 1603, but the office quarter books do not show him as being active or paid as a member of the board until the March 1604 quarter. He served until his death, the last payment of his allowances being for the September quarter of 1609. In May 1609 he was one of those who petitioned for the incorporation of the second Virginia Company, and he was appointed a member of the new management council. Between 12 and 15 July, however, &#145;being sick but of perfect mynde and memory&#146;, he made his oral will in the presence of one Holliland and Roger Knight, leaving all his property to his wife, but asking her to give his black rapier and dagger to his brother Edward Preston, his gilt rapier and dagger to his godson Amyas Preston and &#145;his gylt faulcheon or semiterie with a greene velvet Scaberd&#146; to the son of his elder brother. Probate was granted to his wife on 15 September 1609.<br>
