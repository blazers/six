<span class="headword">White,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1577&#150;1593), <span class="occ">colonist and painter</span>, was apparently of modest Cornish gentry origins. His early and later life remain obscure, owing largely to the commonness of his name. He rose to prominence on the basis of his artistic talent and zeal for American colonization. His watercolour images of Native Americans in the late sixteenth century were exceptional for his era and unsurpassed as a visual record of south-eastern tribal life until the advent of photography.<br>
<br>White's first voyage to America was probably with Martin Frobisher's expedition of 1577, during which it is believed he produced a drawing of a skirmish between the English and the Thule Inuit at Baffin Island. He is probably the same John White listed as a member of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company in 1580.<br>
<br>In 1585 White set out for America as part of the expedition headed by Richard Grenville and Ralph Lane and promoted by Walter Ralegh. He was paired with Thomas Harriot to collect information about the people, plants, and animals of America for the benefit of subsequent colonization efforts. The sympathetic and lively drawings White produced of Carolina Algonquian life, documenting aboriginal settlement patterns, technology, clothing, body decoration, ceremonial life, and subsistence practices, are among the earliest extant images of Native Americans. These images circulated widely as engravings in the first volume of Theodor de Bry's <span class="italic">America</span> (1590). Although de Bry's engravings were less naturalistic and accurate than White's originals, the images became ingrained in the European imagination and helped stimulate the colonial enterprise. They also influenced European pictorial representations of Native Americans for centuries to come.<br>
<br>After White's return from the 1585 voyage his involvement in the promotion of the Virginia colony grew. His stalwart faith in American colonization resulted in Ralegh placing him at the head of a company dedicated to planting a permanent settlement. Ralegh named him governor of the colony, and White took a leading role in raising money and recruiting settlers. With the prospective colonists he set out from Portsmouth in April 1587, but he proved an ineffectual leader and was dominated by the ship's Portuguese pilot, Sim&atilde;o Fernandes, whose real interest lay in privateering. Fernandes left White and the colonists, somewhat against their will, at Roanoke (in present-day North Carolina) instead of at their intended destination on Chesapeake Bay.<br>
<br>White's brief leadership on land was also beset with difficulties. Although the colony aspired to peaceful coexistence with the native population, prior mistreatment of the latter by Lane's colonists placed relations on a tenuous footing. White's decision to make a show of strength after the murder of one of his settlers backfired when his men inadvertently attacked a party of friendly Croatoans.<br>
<br>Amid concern over provisions, White's charges convinced him to return to England to lobby for relief, and he was back in Southampton by November 1587. His prompt return to Virginia was thwarted by a variety of circumstances. First, the threat of Spain's armada resulted in the requisitioning of the ships he had intended to take back to Virginia. When White finally set out, in April 1588, he did so with two vessels that were not only smaller than he had hoped but which were dedicated to privateering. The ships were attacked in the course of their activities and forced to return to England.<br>
<br>It was not until 1590 that White could again raise ships and supplies. After reaching Roanoke in that year he found the colony disappeared and his possessions ransacked. Although evidence suggested the colonists had taken shelter among the nearby Croatoans, bad weather and sailing mishaps forced White to abort his search and return to England. Among the missing colonists were his daughter, Ellinor, and his granddaughter, Virginia Dare, the first child born to English parents in America.<br>
<br>White settled in Ireland, and wrote Richard Hakluyt a letter in 1593 from his house in Ballynoe, co. Cork. While the details of his later life have bedevilled researchers, a strong case has been put forward that he lived on Ralegh's estate and produced farm surveys for him as late as 1598. A will for a John White, &#145;late of parts beyond the seas&#146;, was proved in 1606, but whether this was the same John White remains uncertain.<br>
