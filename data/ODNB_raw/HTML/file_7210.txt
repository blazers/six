<span class="headword">Dafydd ap Gwilym</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1330&#150;1350), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born perhaps <i>c</i>.1315 at Brogynin, an estate located partly in the parish of Llanfihangel Genau'r-glyn and partly in the parish of Llanbadarn Fawr in northern Cardiganshire, some 5 miles inland from the castle and borough of Aberystwyth. He may have died <i>c</i>.1350, possibly as the result of the black death, and was probably buried at the Cistercian abbey of Strata Florida (although the Premonstratensian abbey of Talyllychau also lays claim to his bones). Place-name evidence in his poems confirms overwhelmingly his attachment to his place of birth in northern Cardiganshire, although it also shows that he wandered freely over much of Wales as it then was. It should be stressed that the dates of birth and death given above are conjectural (many scholars would prefer a somewhat later floruit), and an element of uncertainty surrounds his family history also.<h2>
<a name="Parentageandearlywritings"></a>Parentage and early writings</h2>He was the son of Gwilym Gam (Crooked William) ap Gwilym ab Einion of the line of Gwynfardd Dyfed, who lived in northern Pembrokeshire during the latter part of the eleventh century and whose descendants collaborated consistently and profitably with the Anglo-Norman conquerors. According to genealogies, Gwilym married Ardudful, daughter of Gwilym ap Rhys of the line of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8509/', "Ednyfed Fychan")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77357/', "Tudor family, forebears of (per. c.1215&#150;1404)")</script>]; she was thus the sister of Llywelyn ap Gwilym ap Rhys, a substantial landowner in the parishes of Pen-boyr and Nevern in south-west Wales, deputy constable of Newcastle Emlyn in 1343 and deputy justiciar of south Wales (under Sir Gilbert Talbot) in 1344&#150;5. On both his mother's side and (more distantly) his father's, Dafydd ap Gwilym was related to Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd, by far the most powerful Welsh magnate in the southern principality during the first half of the fourteenth century. As far as is known, Dafydd had no brothers or sisters, nor did he <i>sensu stricto</i> ever marry, in spite of the fact that his attachment to women provided the matter of the greater part of his verse.<br>
<br>As might be expected from his relatively high birth, and as the meagre evidence on the topic in his own verse suggests, Dafydd ap Gwilym was not left without means by his parents. The presumption is that he inherited lands that he was able to let and thus live on the income; but this income he certainly supplemented with the earnings he received from declaiming his verse (perhaps to his own musical accompaniment) in gentry households throughout Wales: judging by the surviving corpus, his love songs attracted such earnings no less than formal panegyric. Crucial to his formation as a poet was the fact that he was partly brought up at Newcastle Emlyn by his uncle Llywelyn ap Gwilym who apparently taught him the art of Welsh verse as well as more mundane accomplishments, which might have included a knowledge of French and English. It has been argued that he also spent some time at Strata Florida Abbey, where he would have learned a certain amount of Latin as well as liturgical singing. At that time important manuscripts were still being produced in the scriptorium at Strata Florida; the gentry household of Ieuan Llwyd at Parcrhydderch some 10 miles to the south-west was a focus of patronage for professional poets; and somewhere in the vicinity Einion Offeiriad (Einion the Priest) was preparing his manual on Welsh poetic art at the behest of Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd. Dafydd's innate poetic gifts were thus expanded and developed by an educative process which left him endowed not only with complete mastery of the traditional forms of Welsh versecraft but also with a sensitivity to external influence and a readiness to experiment which proved fundamental to his later career as a poet.<h2>
<a name="Versecompositions"></a>Verse compositions</h2>Dafydd ap Gwilym's verse, in its most recent critical edition, consists of 150 poems, comprising in all rather more than 7000 lines; since 1952 a further 3 poems have been added to the canon (others are under discussion). Of these 153 poems it may be said that 27 are traditional in theme&#151;panegyric, satire, poetic debate, and religious devotion&#151;while the remaining 126 celebrate love, often but not always in a woodland setting; the line count of these love poems amounts to almost 6000. An analysis of the corpus by metrical form is equally revealing: 8 of Dafydd's poems are <i>awdlau</i>, 5 are sequences of <i>englynion</i>, and the remaining 140 are <i>cywyddau</i>. These figures define Dafydd as overwhelmingly a love poet employing the <i>cywydd</i> metre. This is in stark contrast to the situation obtaining in the previous century (and even, in some circles, in his own century as well), when the Welsh professional poet was typically a court official praising the king and the occasional nobleman in <i>awdl</i> metres, although <i>englynion</i> were also sometimes used. Dafydd thus represents a decisive break with tradition in both metrics and matter. He may indeed have invented the <i>cywydd</i> metre by embellishing and regularizing the humble <i>traethodl</i> hitherto used exclusively (as far as can be judged) by lower-grade poets, and he certainly popularized the <i>cywydd</i> to the extent that it remained the staple of Welsh professional poetry for a further 300 years [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48659/', "Cywyddwyr (act. c.1330&#150;c.1650)")</script>]. The break with tradition as regards matter is more difficult to assess: Dafydd certainly had his forerunners as love poet, but the scale and preponderance of love poetry in Dafydd's verse is entirely new. While it is clear that there was a shift in taste from panegyric to love poetry among the class that increasingly assumed the role of patron, that is the landowning, office-holding <i>uchelwyr</i> (literally &#145;men of high birth&#146;), it has been argued that Dafydd's love poetry may be disguised panegyric, designed to uphold the ideals and morale of the Welsh &eacute;lite in the face of the Norman advance. Nevertheless, it is likely that Dafydd is chiefly a love poet because that is the role that best suited both his personality and his experience of life.<br>
<br>Before describing Dafydd ap Gwilym's love poetry in more detail, however, it may be as well to glance briefly at his more traditional verse. His five conventional but skilful and sincere religious poems include a metrical version of the liturgical prayer <span class="italic">Anima Christi</span>, which had only recently become popular. Of his praise poems, seven are addressed to Ifor ap Llywelyn (Ifor Hael), and it is noteworthy that four of the seven are <i>cywyddau</i>, probably the first praise <i>cywyddau</i> ever composed. Other recipients of his praise, whether in life or death, include his uncle Llywelyn ap Gwilym, his neighbour Ieuan Llwyd of Genau'r-glyn, Hywel ap Goronwy, dean (and later bishop) of Bangor, and Angharad, wife of Ieuan Llwyd of Parcrhydderch. There is also a group of four mock elegies for his friend and patron Rhydderch, the son of Ieuan Llwyd, and for his fellow poets Gruffudd ab Adda ap Dafydd, Madog Benfras, and Gruffudd Gryg. Dafydd's satiric <i>awdl</i> for Rhys Meigen, which is supposed to have caused Rhys's death, is clumsy invective like so many of its kind. His acrimonious poetic debate with Gruffudd Gryg, however, has as its core one question of substance: the validity or otherwise of the self-abasement typical of the new love poetry that Dafydd personified.<h2>
<a name="Lovepoetry"></a>Love poetry</h2>Of the 126 love poems now attributed to Dafydd ap Gwilym, nearly two-thirds are anonymous, in the sense that the object of the poet's love is not named in any of them. In 35 poems, however, she is named as Morfudd, in 9 as Dyddgu, and in 3 as Efa, Elen, and Luned respectively. It is a striking fact that the husbands of both Morfudd and Elen can be identified in records and that the father of Dyddgu can be traced&#151;albeit tentatively&#151;in pedigrees; furthermore, Luned is linked with Hugh Tyrrel, a royal official who died in Brittany in 1343, and Efa may just possibly be the second wife of Ifor ap Llywelyn. That is, Dafydd ap Gwilym's loves were indeed creatures of flesh and blood, and not figments of his imagination as was once thought. The figures given above show clearly Morfudd's pre-eminence among them, and a case can be made for assuming that the greater part of Dafydd's &#145;anonymous&#146; love poems were also addressed to her. If this assumption is made, the story of their relationship becomes somewhat clearer. The daughter of a Merioneth <i>uchelwr</i>, Morfudd first met Dafydd while both were living in north-west Wales. They fell in love, and Dafydd began to compose <i>cywyddau</i> in praise of her, probably the first <i>cywyddau</i> ever composed: these became hugely popular. Dafydd and Morfudd may even have entered into a loose form of marriage contract with each other. Later, however, Morfudd was married formally to a man known as Y Bwa Bychan (the Little Hunchback), who was a neighbour of Dafydd's in north Cardiganshire and who henceforth (as Y Bwa Bach) was to play the role of the Jealous Husband in Dafydd's verse. Dafydd continued to pursue Morfudd, however, and was sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected. Eventually Y Bwa Bychan appears to have secured Dafydd's banishment from his house and lands in north Cardiganshire, and this may have been the occasion of his sojourn with Ifor ap Llywelyn in south-east Wales (another theory is that he may have gone to Ifor ap Llywelyn following the murder of his uncle Llywelyn ap Gwilym, which may have been connected with the granting of the castle of Emlyn to Sir Richard de la Bere in 1346). Finally Dafydd was forced to acknowledge defeat and to renounce Morfudd. It should be stressed that this outline depends entirely on the internal evidence of the poems and on later tradition&#151;both highly problematic sources&#151;but it does offer a framework into which many of Dafydd's love <i>cywyddau</i> can provisionally be fitted.<br>
<br>Such a bare outline, however, does scant justice to the rich texture of Dafydd ap Gwilym's verse and the complexity of the emotions expressed in it. As already mentioned, much of this verse has a woodland setting and Dafydd celebrates lovingly not only his beloved's beauty but also the glory of wild nature and the creatures which inhabit it. Birds are especially favoured, and are also prominent among the agents chosen by him to act as his messengers of love: some of his most dazzling passages of <i>dyfalu</i> (a descriptive technique involving the accumulation of juxtaposed metaphors) are devoted to such. Sometimes the scene shifts to the beloved's house, but Dafydd is often ill at ease in such a setting, where hindrances to his assignations abound (although nature, too, can produce such hindrances). One memorable poem is set in Dafydd's parish church of Llanbadarn Fawr, where his devotion to the young women in the congregation rather than to the Blessed Sacrament might be thought to give point to the admonitions levelled at him from time to time by the friars (admonitions which, except towards the end of his life, he scornfully rejects). Although in a sense an Aberystwyth man, his experience of boroughs elsewhere in Wales is not uniformly happy, since these provide the setting for his most <i>fabliau</i>-like escapades in which he is invariably worsted. Mention of <i>fabliaux</i> serves to underline the point that Dafydd was seemingly well aware of the fashions and conventions of love poetry in Europe in his time, and that he makes considerable, if highly individualistic, use of such fashions and conventions. How he came to know of these fashions and conventions is a matter still under discussion: some of them may have reached him through sub-literary channels, others by personal contact within the mixed society of which he was a member. Moreover, it has been pointed out that there are possible direct borrowings in his work from the <span class="italic">Amores</span> of Ovid, from <span class="italic">Le roman de la rose</span>, and from the poetry of Jean de Cond&eacute;. It is not as a confusing blend of influences that Dafydd's verse impresses, however, but as the product of the unified vision of a man who was able to respond to the full to the joys and sorrows of life&#151;for which the joys and sorrows of love provided a far from inadequate metaphor&#151;and to express his response in poetry of consummate craftsmanship, unflagging invention, and haunting verbal music.<br>
