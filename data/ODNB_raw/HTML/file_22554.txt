<span class="headword">Portal,  Abraham</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">goldsmith and playwright</span>, was born in Clowne, Derbyshire, and baptized there on 10 May 1726, the son of Peter William Portal (1685&#150;1768), a Church of England clergyman whose family had migrated to England as Huguenot refugees in 1699, and his wife, Mary Magdalene Findlater, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meure (<i>d</i>. 1754). Abraham Portal spent the first eight years of his childhood in rural Derbyshire before his family moved to London. In 1740 he was bonded to a seven-year apprenticeship for a premium of &pound;35 as a goldsmith to Paul De Lamerie, probably through the influence of his mother's cousin Peter Meure, also in that trade. On 21 August 1748, at St George's Chapel, Mayfair, Portal married Elizabeth Nethersole (1723&#150;1758), the daughter of a lieutenant in the marines. The families were close; Portal's elder brother and younger sister also married into the Nethersole family. Elizabeth had a son in 1749, but he died in infancy, and they had no further children.<br>
<br>Portal had continued to work for De Lamerie, but on 26 October 1749 he registered his own mark with the Goldsmiths' Company as a &#145;large worker&#146;, and later set up business for himself on Ludgate Hill. He did well at his trade, and some fine examples of his work have survived dated between 1754 and 1764. Portal's first wife died in 1758, and in that year his brother Andrew, who had become vicar of Abingdon, introduced him to the Bedwells, a local family; by the end of 1758 Portal had married Elizabeth Bedwell (1739/40&#150;1808). They had nine children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Elizabeth Portal (1759&#150;1834), Mary Portal (1762&#150;1803), Ann Cracroft Portal (1766&#150;1843), Martha Portal (1768&#150;1855), William Nash Portal (1770&#150;1804), and Richard Brinsley Portal (1784&#150;1859).<br>
<br>Portal, however, was not content with his work as a goldsmith, and while maintaining the business attempted to launch a literary career. He was encouraged by John Langhorne, the translator of Plutarch, who took a great interest in the progress of this &#145;tradesman-poet&#146;. Portal's first play, <span class="italic">Olindo and Sophronia: a Tragedy</span>, was based on a story from Tasso and appeared in two editions in 1758. <span class="italic">Vortimer, or, The True Patriot: a Tragedy</span>, set in the time at which the Romans left Britain, was probably written in 1762, although not published until 1796. Another play, <span class="italic">The Indiscreet Lover: a Comedy</span>, was performed at the Haymarket theatre for the benefit of the British Lying-in Hospital in Browlow Street, and appeared in two editions in 1768. While David Baker took a dim view of this work, remarking that &#145;charity covereth a multitude of failings&#146;, John Genest found two of the characters, Old and Young Reynard, &#145;excellent&#146;. The work is concerned with the oppression of women, and two of the best roles are those of a prostitute and a servant girl. It was more sophisticated and satiric than Portal's other more moralistic work, and he appended a list of &#145;errata&#146; to the printed versions, in which the reader was requested to substitute polite paraphrases for coarse expressions found in the original text. It was this kind of fastidiousness that probably led to Portal's being wrongly named as the author of <span class="italic">Antiprofanus, a Letter to David Garrick</span> (1760), a pamphlet by &#145;A.P.&#146;, attacking blasphemy and obscenity on the stage. Portal also published <span class="italic">Songs, Duets and Finale</span> (1778) from the comic opera <span class="italic">The Cady of Bagdad</span> (music by Thomas Linley the younger, libretto by Portal).<br>
<br>Portal went bankrupt in 1778, and this has been attributed to a combination of worsening economic conditions for goldsmiths, and to the fact that his literary efforts had led to a decreasing involvement in the business. Portal then set up as a small bookseller and publisher in the Strand; it was at this time that he issued by subscription the collected edition of his poetry, entitled simply <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1781), and dedicated to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who had acted as godfather to his youngest son, and from whom Portal hoped for some kind of patronage or assistance. In 1781 this came in the form of the post of box-keeper at the Drury Lane theatre, a position which he held for many years. Portal continued working as a stationer, however, until in 1786 he re-established himself as a silversmith at 54 Shoe Lane, albeit in a much reduced line of business. In 1790 he moved to 19 Castle Street, Holborn, where he spent the remainder of his life. He suffered a further blow, however, by the unspecified dishonest actions associated with the secret marriage in 1793 of his eldest son, William Nash Portal, formerly his assistant in the renewed business. As Christopher Portal puts it:<blockquote>It is a sign of his integrity that he was still paying a dividend to the creditors [from his original bankruptcy] in 1791, a few years before he was again reduced to penury by the dishonesty of his elder son. (Portal, 103)</blockquote>Unfortunate in business and unsuccessful in his literary endeavours, Portal died a disappointed man in London in 1809. His plays and poetry:<blockquote>vary widely in quality, but the best of them are interesting and seem only narrowly to have missed commercial success. However, his surviving work as a silversmith shows a talent which could have gained him a place among the best craftsmen of a brilliant age had he maintained his early standard and level of production throughout his career. (Portal, 160)</blockquote>
