<span class="headword">Owen,  David</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Brutus]</span>  (1795&#150;1866), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born in late 1795 at Llanpumpsaint, near Carmarthen, and baptized on 25 December 1795, the son of David Benjamin Owen, a shoemaker and an Anglican parish clerk, and Rachel Owen, a Baptist. He was educated locally, and at Carmarthen grammar school, where he learned Greek and Latin. As a youth he took an interest in magic and the &#145;black arts&#146;, which he satirized in later life. While serving a medical apprenticeship with Dr John Thomas, at Aberdyar, near Llanybydder, he was introduced to Baptism by the doctor's brother, the Revd Timothy Thomas, and shortly thereafter joined the Baptist church. Deciding upon a career in the ministry, he spent a year at the Baptist college, Bristol. He was then for three years a schoolmaster and lay preacher at Gilfach, near Aber, Caernarvonshire, before taking charge of the Baptist churches of Tal-y-graig, Galltraeth, Tyndonnen, and Rhoshirwaun on the Ll&#375;n peninsula, Caernarvonshire. There he was ordained, and settled in Llang&iuml;an. In 1820 he married Anne, daughter of Thomas Jones, a farmer from Rhandir and a deacon of the Independent church.<br>
<br>Supplementing his income by teaching and dispensing medical advice, Owen also began to write. He made an explosive impact on literature in Wales when his article &#145;The poverty of the Welsh language&#146; was published in <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span> in 1824 under the signature Brutus, Lleyn (Brutus from Ll&#375;n). In it he accused the Welsh of being intellectually a &#145;nation of thieves&#146;, wholly dependent on English literary culture. The article stimulated a lively public debate, eliciting responses from, among others, Walter Davies 
    (Gwallter Mechain; 1761&#150;1849)
  , Thomas Price 
    (Carnhuanawc; 1787&#150;1848)
  , and Joseph Harris 
    (Gomer; 1773&#150;1825)
  . He continued to play the same provocative role in Welsh religious and cultural criticism for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Owen's relations with nonconformity also became strained at this time. For reasons not entirely clear, he informed Dr Lant Carpenter of the Unitarian Association at Bristol that his congregation in Ll&#375;n was leaning towards Unitarianism, and appealed for Unitarian funds. Carpenter found no evidence to support Owen's claim and refused financial support: shortly thereafter, he was expelled from the Baptist church. Partly thanks to his father-in-law's connections, he was accepted into the Independent church of Capel Newydd. He moved to Tyddyn Sweep, Maenaddwyn, near Llannerch-y-medd, Anglesey, and from there to Bontnewydd, near Caernarfon, where he preached and kept school.<br>
<br>Owen was not a popular preacher in either place, and from January 1828 he abandoned the pulpit for journalism, becoming editor of <span class="italic">Lleuad yr Oes</span>, a general, non-denominational monthly journal published by Samuel Thomas in Aberystwyth. During this period, when he lived in Llanbadarn Fawr, he wrote a pamphlet attacking child baptism (1828), which was answered by Benjamin Jones (Llanrwst) in 1831, and a ferocious attack on Catholicism, <span class="italic">Cwymp babilon fawr</span> (1829). In 1830, facing bankruptcy, Samuel Thomas sold the title to Jeffrey Jones of Llandovery. Owen remained its editor, and moved to Pentre-t&#375;-gwyn. Following the death of Jones in 1830, a successor, <span class="italic">Yr Efangylydd</span>, was launched in 1831 by another Llandovery printer, the Anglican William Rees, and a group of Independent ministers. Under Owen's editorship, the journal became increasingly conservative in both politics and theology, and the Independent contributors sought to dismiss him. Backed by the Anglican printer, Owen retained his post for a time, but the Independents withdrew their support and thus brought the journal to an end in May 1835.<br>
<br>In August 1835 the Independents launched their own radical, anti-tory and anti-Anglican magazine <span class="italic">Y Diwygiwr</span>, in Llanelli, under the editorship of David Rees 
    (y Cynhyrfwr; 1801&#150;1869)
  , while a month earlier Owen, now returned to the Anglican church, had begun to edit for William Rees a new monthly Anglican periodical, <span class="italic">Yr Haul</span>. The two journals, led by two strong editors, defined much of Welsh religious, political, and cultural life in the period between their launch and Owen's death in 1866. In <span class="italic">Yr Haul</span>, Owen satirized and vilified nonconformity in general and Independent presbyterianism (or &#145;Great Independia&#146;) in particular. He was the author, under the pseudonym Bleddyn, of biographies of the leading Welsh religious figures Christmas Evans (1840), John Elias (1844), John Edwards (1849), and Thomas Williams (1861). He also published bitingly satirical pamphlets, such as <span class="italic">Papuryn achlysurol: drych y brad, yn cynnwys yr asyn quadrupedaidd a'r asyn bipedaidd &hellip; gan rigdum funnidos</span> (1843), though his most enduring creations were &#145;Bugeiliaid Eppynt&#146;, serialized in <span class="italic">Yr Haul</span>, 1835&#150;66, and &#145;Wil Brydydd y Coed; Cofiant Siencyn bach y llwywr; a chofiant Dai Hunandyb&#146;, serialized in that journal from September 1863 to December 1865 (the latter was published posthumously in Carmarthen in 1876). A selection of his articles and poems from <span class="italic">Yr Haul</span> was published in <span class="italic">Brutusiana, sef casgliad detholedig o'i gyfansoddiadau</span> (1855), which included strong attacks on slavery  (p. 237) and a passionate defence of Welsh patriotism  (pp. 328&#150;35).<br>
<br>As early as 1824 Joseph Harris had recognized in Owen a brilliant &#145;advocatus diaboli&#146;, and it was said in 1883 that &#145;Brutus was the first Welsh writer who made politics popular&#146;. He received a pension from the civil list in 1858. He died of gout, in great pain, on 16 January 1866, leaving a widow and several children. He was buried on 19 January 1866 in Llywel church.<br>
