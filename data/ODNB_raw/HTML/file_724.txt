<span class="headword">Arundel <span class="st"> [Arundell]</span>,  Richard</span>, first Baron Arundell of Trerice  (1616&#150;1687), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/722/', "John Arundell (1576&#150;1654x6)")</script> of Trerice, Cornwall, and Mary, daughter of George Cary of Clovelly. He was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn on 16 November 1633. Called to the bar on 18 November 1640, he kept his chambers at the inn until suspended for royalism in 1646. About 1645 he married Gertrude Bagge of Saltram, widow of a prominent royalist, Sir Nicholas Slanning.<br>
<br>Arundel represented Lostwithiel in the parliaments of 1640. On 21 April 1641 he voted against the attainder of Strafford, remaining a member until his execution of the commission of array led to expulsion from the house on 22 January 1642. Arundel's family were among the most influential within the Cornish royalist party. Little is certainly known about his early military career, but he is said to have been present at the battle of Edgehill and had a command at Lansdown on 5 June 1643. He is known to have acted in 1645 as one of the king's revenue commissioners of assessment in Cornwall and in the autumn was appointed colonel in command of the trained bands and the garrison posted in the stronghold of Pendennis, near Falmouth, where his father was governor. The royalist position, even in the far west, deteriorated rapidly, but Pendennis Castle held out long past the surrenders of Oxford and Worcester. Grasping the hopelessness of their situation, some die-hard officers&#151;who may well have included Richard Arundel&#151;are said to have tried to blow up themselves, their tormentors, and the castle itself, using the ordnance stored there, but were prevented by the ordinary soldiers. Pendennis surrendered on 16 August.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1648 Arundel and his father were listed by the committee for compounding among sequestered delinquents in Cornwall, and the following month they were arrested as suspected organizers in the county of that year's provincial insurgency. In March 1650 they were more cautious in the cause of the young Charles Stuart, offering to put troops into the field only on condition that Sir Richard Grenville, the leading Cornish royalist, committed substantial forces first. The county committee of Cornwall wrote on 15 May that the Arundel family &#145;having the most considerable estates of any delinquents within this county, hath hitherto paid nothing&#146; and in December they were reported to be using a clause in the terms of the surrender of Pendennis which referred to the &#145;enjoyment of their estates&#146; to extract more favourable terms than their more moderate neighbours. By a parliamentary order of 20 March 1651 they were fined the huge sum of &pound;10,000, though it seems that a petition was lodged against this. However, on 18 November 1652 they were named on a list of persons invited to compound for their forfeited estates.<br>
<br>Following the death of his brother in 1644 Arundel was heir to what remained of his father's property. The death of his father in the mid-1650s did not propel his successor towards accommodation with the Cromwellian authorities. He is known to have been a Cornish associate of the Sealed Knot in 1654, and the following year, when disagreements paralysed that society, he was involved in the plans of the &#145;action party&#146;, charged with liaising with the agent John Trelawny. The attempt was a failure. But among the networks of royalist conspiracy Arundel's record inspired continuing trust. In July&#150;August 1659 he was privy to new plans for a rising, but remained inactive, upon the advice of the double agent Sir Richard Willis to wait upon the intensification of mutual hostility between the army and the Rump Parliament. But the following month he was involved with Captain Silius Titus and the commander of the garrison of Exeter to deliver the city to the king's forces.<br>
<br>The Restoration brought a marked improvement in Arundel's fortunes. In July 1660 he was appointed to the remodelled commission of the peace in Cornwall, and in September he was made governor of Pendennis Castle, an honorary post he held until his death. In the Convention Parliament and, from 29 January 1662 to 23 March 1665, in the Cavalier Parliament, he was member for Bere Alston, Devon. In December 1660 he was made a colonel of foot in the militia.<br>
<br>Arundel served the new regime as a commissioner, for assessment (1661&#150;5), for the relief of loyal and indigent officers (1662), for corporations (1662&#150;3), and for oyer and terminer on the western circuit (1665). He acted as a deputy lieutenant of Cornwall from 1662 until his death, and on 23 March 1665 was created Baron Arundell of Trerice. During the course of Charles's reign he became a very wealthy man. Rapidly restored to the bulk of his estates, he was made stannator of Tywharnwaile in 1663. Perhaps in 1664, and certainly by the following year, he was appointed master of horse of the queen mother, Henrietta Maria. In 1670 he was granted a free gift of &pound;3000 and in 1674 a pension of &pound;1000 per annum. He was made a freeman of Plymouth in 1684, and of Liskeard, Bodmin, Mitchell, and Penryn the following year.<br>
<br>Arundel retained the traditionalist cavalier outlook. He appears not to have been especially prominent in the house, but sat on nineteen committees and showed particular interest in measures designed to help royalist veterans. In 1663 he served on Commons committees for the more effective prevention of sectarian meetings and for the enforcement of restrictions on corporations. Later decisions illustrate the loyalist cavaliers' dilemma. He is known to have opposed both the exclusion of James, duke of York, from the succession, and the execution of the Roman Catholic Viscount Stafford in December 1680; but Danby reported that after the new king's accession Arundel opposed his Catholicizing policy. Richard Arundel died, probably in London, on 7 September 1687 and was buried at St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
