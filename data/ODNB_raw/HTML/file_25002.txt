<span class="headword">Securis <span class="st"> [Hatchett]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1550&#150;1580), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Salisbury. His name was a latinized version of the English surname Hatchett. Securis was educated at Winchester College, and studied at the University of Paris for two years about 1550, while still very young. He attended and admired the lectures of Jacobus Sylvius, and studied pharmacy in the shops of several apothecaries. He afterwards studied at Oxford, although not at New College as was stated by Wood  (<span class="italic">Ath. Oxon</span>, 1.458), and in 1554 published his first book. Entitled <span class="italic">A gret galley lately com into England out of terra nova laden with phisitions, poticaries, and surgions</span>, it is a dialogue attacking foolish and misguided physicians.<br>
<br>Securis returned to live in Salisbury, and seems to have been licensed to practise medicine by the bishop, to whom he presented a memorial on the granting of episcopal medical diplomas. It contained seven proposals: that every one who wished to practise in the diocese, and was not a graduate of a university, should only do so on receipt of a diploma from the bishop or his chancellor; that surgeons should be required to show that they could read and write; that apothecaries should not prescribe medicines; that no unlicensed person should practise; that no one should assume a university degree which he did not lawfully possess; that midwives should be sworn before the bishop; and that apothecaries' shops should be inspected from time to time by physicians. He mentions the College of Physicians in this memorial with great respect.<br>
<br>In 1561, and perhaps earlier, Securis began to publish <span class="italic">A Prognostication</span> for the year, a small black-letter book, containing definitions of legal terms, advice on suitable times for letting blood, weather forecasts, and suchlike information. He seems to have continued these until 1580.<br>
<br>In 1566 Securis published <span class="italic">A Detection and Querimonie of the Daily Enormities and Abuses Committed in Physick</span>, a small book in an idiomatic, informal style. It discusses physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, laying down rules for the education and conduct of each. Securis expresses his belief in the power of the royal touch of the kings of England and of France. The book contains a Latin dedication to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It was reprinted in 1651, together with Robert Record's <span class="italic">The Urinal of Physick</span>.<br>
<br>The date of Securis's death is unknown. <a name="cosubject_25002"></a><span class="headword">Michael Securis <span class="st"> [Hatchett]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1545), a <span class="occ">physician</span> who lived in the &#145;new borough of Sarum&#146;, was author of &#145;Libri septem de antiquitate ac illustri medicinae origine&#146;, extant in <span class="roman">Digbt MS 202</span> in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, together with some other medical opuscula by the same author.<br>
