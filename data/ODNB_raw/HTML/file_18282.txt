<span class="headword">Mason,  John</span>  (1646?&#150;1694), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and millenarian</span>, was probably the son of Thomas and Margaret Mason, who were mentioned in the parish registers at Irchester, Northamptonshire, as the parents of Thomas (<i>b</i>. 3 April 1643) and Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 2 Feb 1644); an unnamed child of theirs referred to in March 1646 was probably John. Contemporary biographical sources suggest that Mason's early life was spent in Northamptonshire. Certainly Mason's contemporary biographer Henry Maurice mentioned a school in Strixton, where one teacher said of Mason &#145;that if he liv'd, he was like to be a violent Zealot&#146;  (Maurice, 25). On 16 May 1661 Mason was admitted as a sizar at Clare College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1665 and proceeded MA in 1668. It was at university that he began to fulfil the prediction of his former teacher, and was known to be &#145;but careless in some part of his Life there, that he would be sometimes starting of Questions, in reference to the usages of the Church of <i>England</i> (which seem'd to discover some dissatisfaction)&#146;  (ibid., 26).<br>
<br>From 1668 until 1674 Mason was the vicar of Stantonbury, Buckinghamshire. In this he seems to have been the beneficiary of the patronage of John Wittewronge, who had been a parliamentary officer in the civil wars. At the funeral of Wittewronge's daughter, Clare, on 22 October 1669 Mason preached a sermon (later published as <span class="italic">The Waters of Marah Sweetned</span> (1671), based on <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 9: 27&#150;8; this seems to be the first indication of his increasing interest in the second coming. It is unclear exactly when Mason married, but it was while he was at Stantonbury. He had a family of six children including John (1677&#150;1722/3), who became a dissenting minister and whose son John (1706&#150;1763) edited the <span class="italic">Select Remains of John Mason</span> in the 1740s; and William (1681&#150;1744), who became a Church of England clergyman. In 1674 Mason became the rector of Water Stratford, Buckinghamshire, where he lived until his death.<br>
<br>In 1683 Mason published <span class="italic">Spiritual Songs, or, Songs of Praise</span>. This was extremely popular, going into its sixteenth edition in 1761. It is usually cited as among the first compositions in English hymnology. One can find elements borrowed from it in the works of Isaac Watts, and it allegedly influenced John and Samuel Wesley. However, the importance of song in Mason's beliefs suggests that the compositions have more significance than is usually thought. Mason &#145;was a rigid <i>Calvinist</i>, and not a little inclining to <i>Antinomianism</i>&#146;, and he also believed strongly in predestination  (Maurice, 27). His interest in the millennium is hard to pinpoint. Maurice's account divides Mason's life into two separate stages: before 1690 he was a moral, hard-working, moderate cleric, &#145;a Man of severe Morals&#146;  (ibid., 26); Richard Baxter allegedly wrote that he was &#145;the glory of the Church of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Remains</span>, xii). Christopher Hill seems to concur with Maurice that between 1690 and his death in 1694 Mason became &#145;increasingly odd&#146;  (Hill, 332). However, some letters written by Mason, included in <span class="italic">Some Remarkable Passages in the Life and Death of Mr John Mason</span>, published in 1694, predate 1690 and suggest some continuity in his beliefs. Indeed, it was possibly in the 1680s that Mason first became interested in the millennium. Maurice wrote that it was the minister of the nearby town of Haversham, James Wrexham, who was &#145;the very Man that put him first upon <i>Revelation Thoughts</i>&#146;; Wrexham owned a copy of one of John Henry Alsted's works of millenarian chronology  (Maurice, 31). The catalyst for Mason's change has been seen as Wrexham's death and that of Mason's wife shortly afterwards in February 1687, both of which affected Mason greatly.<br>
<br>It is certainly around this date that Mason's fame seems to have been made by his preaching of a sermon based on the parable of the ten virgins, published in 1691 under the title <span class="italic">The Midnight Cry</span>. This is millenarian in tone and interprets apocalyptic passages of scripture in the light of events such as the Thirty Years' War. At the same time Mason started to preach exclusively on the subject of Christ's personal reign on earth, believing that this was to begin shortly in Water Stratford. He began to attract followers, and a community of about 100 gathered south of the village of Water Stratford in an area they named the Holy Ground. Here all possessions were shared, no work was done except that connected to basic survival, and singing and dancing were carried out continuously day and night. Song seems to have been an important part of Mason's eschatology. He believed that Christ &#145;would have all sorts of Musick to attend Him&#146;  (Maurice, 13), and so thought it fitting to have constant singing and dancing in preparation for his arrival. Music also heightened the spiritual process. His followers &#145;found great raisings of their <i>affections</i> by it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Some Remarkable Passages</span>, 5).<br>
<br>It was in this fervent atmosphere that at 1 a.m. on 16 April 1694 Mason had a vision of Christ. He appeared in &#145;a Crimson Garment, his Countenance exceeding Beautiful&#146; with &#145;a deep <i>Scarlet Robe</i> down to his Feet&#146; (Maurice, 6; <span class="italic">Some Remarkable Passages</span>, 1). This image is reminiscent of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 19: 13, which described Christ as &#145;clothed with a vesture dipped in blood&#146;. Mason believed that this appearance of the Son of God heralded the start of Christ's personal reign on earth&#151;and as a result Mason stopped giving the sacrament, preaching, and praying. Mason saw himself in relation to the appearance of Christ and, indeed, his followers &#145;witnessed, That their Prophet was the very Person spoken of, <i>Rev.</i> 1.1. <i>He sent and signified it by his Angel to his servant</i> <i>John</i>. &hellip; Mr. <i>Mason</i> was <i>that</i> <i>Elijah</i>&#146;  (Maurice, 10). Another spiritual predecessor cited by Mason was Noah, and Water Stratford was for Mason the ark where the elect would be safe until the Lord removed them to the New Jerusalem. Also, just as John the Baptist was the Elias who heralded the first appearance of Christ on earth, Mason was the Elias heralding his second coming. However, although Mason styled himself as the messenger and minister of Christ, there is a suggestion that his followers saw him quite differently, believing him to be Christ. Maurice's account of 1695, while sceptical of Mason's claims, does excuse him as a well-meaning but misled clergyman; however, towards Mason's followers Maurice is not so lenient: &#145;I can't forbear expressing my resentment and indignation against all such, as would rob, as would dethrone God, that they may Deifie a Man&#146;  (ibid., 59&#150;60).<br>
<br>Mason published a number of minor works: <span class="italic">Dives and Lazarus</span>, which was appended to the 1685 second edition of <span class="italic">Spiritual Songs</span>; <span class="italic">A Little Catechism, with Little Verses and Little Sayings, for Little Children</span> (1692); and <span class="italic">Penitential Cries</span> (1692). He died from quinsy (possibly linked to the smoking that Maurice claimed he was fond of) in May 1694 at Water Stratford, where he was buried on 22 May. His community did not believe in his death, and Mason's successor, Isaac Rushworth, was forced to exhume his body to prove that he was not about to be resurrected. None the less, the community survived, still believing that Christ would return to earth. Although they were evicted from the land, remnants of the group existed until 1710 and even survived until about 1740.<br>
