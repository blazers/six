<span class="headword">Baird,  James</span>  (1802&#150;1876), <span class="occ">ironmaster and philanthropist</span>, was born at Kirkwood in Lanarkshire on 5 December 1802, the fourth son of Alexander Baird (<i>d</i>. 1833), farmer, and Jean, the daughter of James Moffat. He attended the Old Monkland parish school, and may have attended classes at Anderson College in Glasgow. Alexander Baird was a man of considerable ambition and initiative. He enclosed many of the farms that had been in his family for generations, and seized the opportunity offered by the Napoleonic wars to enlarge his landholdings and broaden his interests, taking over another 250 acres and building a mill. Wishing to provide for his growing family&#151;by this time numbering seven sons and a daughter&#151;he began to lease coalfields and to invest in the manufacture of iron. In 1809 he leased the coalworks at Woodside near Dalserf. In 1816 he added the Rochsolloch coalfield near Airdrie, and in 1822 the Merryston coalfield, to his operations. In 1826 James, together with his father and his brothers William and Alexander, leased the coalfields of Sunnyside, Hollandhirst, and New Gartsherrie. Two years later they leased the rights to mine ironstone at Cairnhill, adjoining Gartsherrie, and began to erect blast furnaces there. By 1842 they had sixteen furnaces operating at the Gartsherrie ironworks.<br>
<br>The Bairds' first furnace was put in blast on 4 May 1830. Alexander Baird retired that year, and four of his sons&#151;William, Alexander, James, and George&#151;formed a partnership, William Baird &amp; Co., to continue the business, joined later by their brothers Robert and Douglas. James Baird was responsible for the management of the firm, and took a leading role in the development and improvement of plant. Building on the work of James Beaumont Neilson, the inventor and patentee of the hot-blast furnace, he organized the installation of the first circular furnace in Scotland in 1832, developed improved blast heaters, and introduced other innovations in order to improve efficiency and output. As a result of his endeavours, individual furnace production increased from 60 to 250 tons of iron per week. Attempts made in concert with other Scottish ironmasters to break Neilson's hot-blast patent met with less success&#151;Bairds finally settled out of court, paying the patent holder over &pound;106,000 in royalties and expenses.<br>
<br>William Baird &amp; Co. expanded, acquiring coalfields and ironworks in other parts of Lanarkshire and in the counties of Ayr, Stirling, Dumbarton, and Cumberland. A subsidiary, the Eglinton Iron Company, added works at Eglinton in 1846, Blair in 1852, Muirkirk and Lugar in 1856, and Portland in 1864. It has been estimated that by the mid-1860s Bairds was responsible for 25 per cent of Scotland's output of pig iron, with a capacity to produce up to 300,000 tons per annum. It employed 10,000 men and boys, and recent historians agree with the contemporary view that Bairds was probably the largest single producer of pig iron in the world. James Baird practically retired from the business during the early 1860s, leaving its management in the hands of his nephews. His interest in industrial technology was undimmed, however, and he took out a number of patents for improvements to coal-cutting equipment.<br>
<br>Baird and his brothers were committed supporters of the Conservative Party. William Baird was MP for the Falkirk burghs in 1841&#150;6, and James represented the same constituency in 1851&#150;2 and 1852&#150;7. He remained an active campaigner for the party in later years, and in 1873 chaired a meeting held to celebrate Benjamin Disraeli's being granted the freedom of the city of Glasgow, and his election as rector of the university. The Baird brothers built many churches to serve the communities in which their employees lived, and James Baird campaigned vigorously for the Church of Scotland to make greater efforts to serve the needs of the population in industrial areas. In 1873 he made a gift of &pound;500,000 to the church, to &#145;assist in providing the means of meeting, or at least as far as possible promoting the mitigation of spiritual destitution among the population of Scotland&#146;. The church set up the Baird Trust to administer the funds and carry out the wishes of the benefactor.<br>
<br>Baird's brothers all predeceased him, and on Robert's death in 1856 James succeeded to the estate of Auchmedden in Aberdeenshire. Already the owner of small estates in Ayrshire, he acquired Cambusdoon in Ayrshire in 1853, Knoydart in western Inverness-shire in 1857, and Muirkirk in Ayrshire in 1863. He served as a magistrate for Lanarkshire, and a deputy lieutenant for the counties of Ayr and Inverness.<br>
<br>In 1852 Baird married Charlotte, the daughter of Robert Lockhart of Castlehill, Lanarkshire. Two years after Charlotte's death in 1857, he married Isabella Agnew, daughter of Admiral James Hay of Belton, East Lothian, who survived him. He had no children. In 1876 he fell ill with bronchitis on a trip to London. He returned to Cambusdoon, but died two weeks later, on 20 June. He was buried beside his first wife at Alloway. The gross value of his estate in the United Kingdom was recorded as &pound;1,190,868 14<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> recorded that he was:<blockquote>a man of great energy and force of character, [who] also possessed a Scotchman's prudence&#151;not the prudence which never dares, but the fine spirit of caution which, first carefully counting the costs, goes boldly forward, and is seldom taken by surprise. (21 June 1876)</blockquote>
