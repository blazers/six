<span class="headword">Foster, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1548&#150;1612), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 10 August 1548, the son of Thomas Foster (<i>d</i>. 1571?), possibly a yeoman in the queen's household, of Hunsdon, and his wife, Margaret Browning (<i>d</i>. 1585&times;99). Foster was admitted to the Inner Temple from Clifford's Inn on 16 October 1571, but the date of his call to the bar is uncertain; it probably occurred after his marriage on 22 July 1575 to Susan (<i>c</i>.1552&#150;1626), daughter of another Thomas Foster, of Iden, Sussex, and certainly before he delivered a reading at Clifford's Inn in 1584. He enjoyed a thriving practice in Westminster Hall, and from 1593 Foster was retained as fee'd counsel by the city of London, where he also worked with the Company of Skinners, while serving in his native county as steward of the manor of Amwell Parva or Rusheyne. Called to the bench in January 1595, Foster delivered his reading on 32 Hen. VIII c. 32 in August 1596. In January 1600 he was among fourteen Inner Temple benchers levied for the Irish campaign, although he paid only the minimum contribution of &pound;10.<br>
<br>Foster was one of those nominated as serjeants-at-law towards the end of 1601 but not actually called until May 1603, after James I's accession, when he named Robert Cecil, Lord Howard of Walden, and Lord Hunsdon as patrons. Appointed serjeant to Queen Anne in 1603, and to Prince Henry in 1604, when he was also knighted, Foster was mentioned as a possible attorney of wards in October 1605. But not until November 1607 did he gain further promotion, as puisne justice of common pleas. Foster died in London on 18 May 1612, shortly after his nomination by Thomas Sutton as one of the original governors of the Charterhouse School, and was buried on 11 June in Hunsdon church under an elaborate tomb with full-length effigy. A manuscript treatise in Cambridge University Library  (Add. MS 8945, fols. 1&#150;27<i>v</i>), &#145;A brief declaration of the use of the law by Justice Foster&#146;, is substantially identical to the text published in 1629 as the second part of <span class="italic">The Lawyer's Light</span>, where it is attributed to John Dodderidge, although Francis Bacon has also been identified as author.<br>
<br>Thomas Foster's religion is unknown, but his widow was presented as a recusant before the Hertfordshire quarter sessions in the early 1620s. His youngest son, the royalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9967/', "Sir Robert Foster (1589&#150;1663)")</script>, served as a judge under both Charles I and Charles II.<br>
