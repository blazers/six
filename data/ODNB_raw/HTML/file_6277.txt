<span class="headword">Coppin,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1645&#150;1659), <span class="occ">nonconformist preacher and writer</span>, about whom little is known except what he recounts in <span class="italic">Truths Testimony</span> (1655), was probably from Kent, and grew up to be an unexceptional pious believer within the established church. He was probably a student at Oxford but left without taking a degree; no record survives of his matriculation.<br>
<br>Probably in the mid- to later 1640s and while he was living in London, Coppin was attracted successively to Presbyterianism, Independency, and the Baptists, rejecting each in turn as manifestations of spiritual tyranny or forms of worship that were merely human inventions. He turned instead&#151;probably about 1648&#151;to a purely personal religion which was marked by a principle of saying or writing nothing &#145;that should perish or come to an end&#146;. This represented the beginning of Coppin's ministry of preaching the redemption of all things, a message that was both anti-clerical and anti-university. He operated as a preacher, claiming that any money he received was turned over to the poor, in or near the Thames valley in Berkshire and Oxfordshire, where he encountered the hostility of local puritan ministers, most of whom were predestinarians and Baptists if not also Fifth Monarchists. By this time Coppin was part of a group of radical puritans all of whom had &#145;risen above ordinances&#146; to await the coming of a higher spiritual order. Among these was the Ranter Abiezer Coppe, who influenced Coppin's beliefs and provided a preface for Coppin's extensive discussion and defence of his beliefs, <span class="italic">Divine Teachings</span>, published in London in 1649. This group would have been identified at the time as &#145;Seekers&#146; and, in Coppe's account, had established a well-developed network across several towns and villages in the area. The response of the ministers in Berkshire was to contain Coppin's impact with the lure of a preferment in return for his recantation and a perhaps ill-conceived attempt to buy up every copy of his book.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Divine Teachings</span> is a remarkable work of religious enthusiasm, with its firm belief that the Holy Spirit or Christ had come to live within the meek and uneducated. Coppin argued that clergy would be punished while thieves and murderers would go free. Also evident in this text is the marked habit of controlled allegorical interpretation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, a central feature that infuriated the presbyterian divines with whom he disputed and who labelled him variously as a Familist and a Jesuit. Coppin's ideas are distinctive but are also related to many of those in the radical puritan diaspora. He believed that God and Christ are in all men, and that election pertains to God's choosing of Christ as the saviour of mankind, from which universal salvation follows. For him, the subject of reprobation is not the person but all the evil qualities in mankind that will finally be removed with the resurrection of God in man; death is the state of not recognizing these inner presences, the devil is the not-God that dwells within people, and the wrath of God is a purging of sin from all people. All of this Coppin describes in terms of images: the image of God in man and the possibility of seeing the &#145;Vision of God&#146;.<br>
<br>Coppin continued as an itinerant preacher but his activities led to a series of encounters with the law. Preaching at Burford and Evenlode in the summer of 1651, he found himself in conflict with another group of ministers led by Ralph Nevill and was brought to trial under the terms of the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span> at Worcester the following March. The judge was sympathetic but the jury was not: Coppin was found guilty and bound over until the next assizes. A similar dispute at Enstone in Oxfordshire resulted in a summons to the Oxford assizes in March 1653; once again, despite a sympathetic judge, Coppin was declared guilty and was only discharged at the following assize. The following year Coppin found himself set against both minister and magistrates in Stow on the Wold, Gloucestershire, which led predictably to another appearance at assizes, this time at Gloucester in summer 1654. However, on this occasion, the judge considered the charges to be insubstantial and Coppin was acquitted. During this period Coppin published, among other works, <span class="italic">Saul Smitten for not Smiting Amalek</span>, an allegorical interpretation of scripture written to demonstrate how the <span class="roman">Bible</span> had prophesied the fall of the Rump Parliament in April 1653. Coppin approved of many of the reforms that the succeeding Barebone's Parliament called for, although his own desire for complete religious tolerance would have been far too much for most of that assembly's representatives.<br>
<br>Coppin published his spiritual autobiography and defence of his beliefs, <span class="italic">Truths Testimony</span>, in 1655. In the summer of that year he returned to Kent, where he succeeded the former Ranter Joseph Salmon, who had preached on Sundays in Rochester Cathedral for most of the early half of the decade. Where Salmon had been carefully guarded in his sermons in order to avoid interference, he correctly predicted that Coppin would draw attention to himself. By October a group of local ministers had organized regular preaching against Coppin's alleged assertions about the sinful nature of Christ, that all mankind was the body of Christ, that all would be redeemed, and that there would be no resurrection of the body. Coppin was duly examined on 24 December by Major-General Kelsey and several justices, and was found to have breached the terms of the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span>; he and his supporters were described by Kelsey as &#145;church and state Levellers&#146;. Coppin was imprisoned in Maidstone for six months: &#145;I will delight myself with the worst of men as well as with the best&#146; was his response  (Hill, 222). Two publications, <span class="italic">A Blow at the Serpent</span> (1656) and <span class="italic">Michael Opposing the Dragon</span> (1659), both in much the same vein as his previous writings, represent the last evidence of his activities.<br>
<br>Coppin was one of the first in England to preach universal salvation; the Digger Gerrard Winstanley may have preceded him in this but only just. Although he denied being a Ranter, Coppin's writings, especially <span class="italic">Divine Teachings</span>, were influential among Ranters, and his beliefs may have gathered a small group of followers by the early eighteenth century. Some of his writings were republished in the 1760s when they were the focus of both admiration and opprobrium.<br>
