<span class="headword">Smith,  Richard Malden <span class="st"> [Dick]</span>  Heckstall-</span>  (1934&#150;2004), <span class="occ">jazz and rock saxophonist</span>, was born on 26 September 1934 at Dinham Hall, Ludlow, Shropshire, the only child of Hugh William Heckstall-Smith (1896&#150;1973), schoolmaster and author of scientific textbooks, and his wife, Eileen Violet Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson (1891&#150;1971). One term in a York boarding school was enough for Heckstall-Smith, so in 1947 he went to Gordonstoun, where his father taught. This time it was his father who curtailed his education, as he fell out with the headmaster, Kurt Hahn, and both father and son departed. Dick Heckstall-Smith then found himself a pupil at the liberal Foxhole School in Dartington, Devon. This was more to his liking&#151;effectively, pupils did what they wanted&#151;and he cultivated a passion for clarinet and saxophone, influenced in particular by the New Orleans jazz musician Sidney Bechet. Between 1953 and 1956 he studied agronomy at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and led the university jazz band. Judging an inter-university jazz contest in 1955, the noted clarinettist Sandy Brown recognized his talent and was to ease his entry into the professional world.<br>
<br>As a conscientious objector Heckstall-Smith declined national service and was instructed to work as a hospital orderly for eighteen months, but because of a back injury did only nine. In 1957 he played in London jazz clubs, working with Brown, and releasing an EP recording, <span class="italic">Very Old Special Jazz</span>. In the summer of 1958 he joined a rock'n'roll band at Butlin's, Filey. This easy work made him appreciate the importance of crossing genres. His credo was, &#145;When you're freelance, you say yes to everything&#146;  (personal knowledge). He joined Jerome Robbins's touring <span class="italic">Ballet USA</span> in 1959, participated in jazz and poetry evenings organized by Michael Horowitz and Pete Brown, and played with the commercial &#145;trad&#146; bands of Kenny Ball and Bob Wallis. At this time he became addicted first to alcohol and then to various illegal substances. On 15 September 1958 he married Gertrude Christine (Gary) Dobringer, a twenty-year-old Austrian au pair, and daughter of Josef Dobringer, electrician. They had a son, Arthur, but divorced in 1973.<br>
<br>In March 1962 Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies formed Blues Inc. for dates in and around London, notably at the Marquee. The line-up was fluid but Heckstall-Smith was with them for over a year. Several musicians, including Mick Jagger, Long John Baldry, and Paul Jones, established their own bands, and one splinter unit was the Graham Bond ORGANization with Graham Bond (organ), Jack Bruce (bass), and Ginger Baker (drums). Heckstall-Smith joined in September 1963, and played on their albums <span class="italic">The Sound of '65</span> and <span class="italic">There's a Bond Between Us</span>. However, Bond's drug dependence, obsession with black magic, and chaotic organization destroyed the group.<br>
<br>John Mayall's Bluesbreakers also specialized in personnel changes, and Heckstall-Smith was recruited in September 1967. He contributed to <span class="italic">Bare Wires</span> (1968). Unfortunately for Mayall the arrival of Jon Hiseman on drums led to the formation of the progressive rock group Colosseum with Hiseman and Heckstall-Smith in September 1968. Colosseum included the guitarist James Litherland (and later Clem Clempson), the organist Dave Greenslade, and the bassist Tony Reeves (later Mick Clarke), with vocals from Chris Farlowe. They broke with the tradition of having twelve songs on an album in favour of long and sometimes rambling suites. Their best-selling albums <span class="italic">Those Who are about to Die Salute You</span> (1969), <span class="italic">Valentyne Suite</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Daughter of Time</span> (1970) influenced such groups as Led Zeppelin and Chicago. Heckstall-Smith, an imposing figure with his dark beard and balding head, also played on Jack Bruce's solo album <span class="italic">Things We Like</span> (1970), and on albums by Davey Graham, Neil Ardley, Chicken Shack, and Pete Brown's Battered Ornaments.<br>
<br>Colosseum disbanded in 1971 after a disastrous show in Italy where everybody blamed everybody else. Working with the lyricist Pete Brown, Heckstall-Smith made a solo album, <span class="italic">A Story Ended</span> (1972), and then formed Manchild, which supported Deep Purple on an American tour. He abandoned touring after suffering a spinal injury, which took several years to heal. In its place he studied social sciences at South Bank Polytechnic and graduated in 1979. He returned to music with his bands Big Chief, Mainsqueeze, and DHS$. The eclecticism became more marked, Heckstall-Smith playing African-influenced jazz one day and funk the next. In 1989 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Safest Place in the World</span>, later expanded into <span class="italic">Blowing the Blues</span> (2004). In 1992 he suffered a stroke during a bypass operation, but he regained his speech and movement. He recorded with Jack Bruce (<span class="italic">This That</span>, 1995), played &#145;world&#146; music with Celtic Steppes, and joined the re-formed Colosseum for a European tour. He worked with the Hamburg Blues Band and, in 1998, made an album with John Etheridge, <span class="italic">Obsessiveness</span>. In 2000 he recorded an album, <span class="italic">Blues and Beyond</span>, produced by Pete Brown and featuring Jack Bruce, Paul Jones, Mick Taylor, John Mayall, Peter Green, and members of Colosseum. He called it &#145;the record I had always wanted to make&#146;  (personal knowledge), and it resembled a musical autobiography.<br>
<br>Heckstall-Smith worked in jazz, rock, and blues and its many fusions, and did accomplished work in all the areas he touched. Many, however, remembered him primarily for his party piece where he played two saxophones at once, thus emulating another hero, Roland Kirk. He died on 17 December 2004 at Queen Mary's Hospital, Camden, London, of cirrhosis of the liver, and was survived by his son, Arthur.<br>
