<span class="headword">Melhuish,  Sara</span>  (1861&#150;1939), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 28 April 1861 at Oxton, Cheshire, the daughter of Charles Melhuish (<i>d</i>. before 1891), general merchant, and his wife, Emily Martha Hull. Little is known of her early life until 1885, when she appeared as a day student at University College, Liverpool, residing in Birkenhead. She was an excellent student, earning a scholarship and a first-class honours degree in history in 1890 from the Victoria University, of which University College, Liverpool, was a constituent school. Upon graduation she received the Charles Beard fellowship, enabling her to remain at the college as an assistant to the professor of history from 1890 to 1891. She was granted an MA degree from the Victoria University in 1905. In 1891 she received a scholarship to attend Somerville College, Oxford, where, after only one year of reading, she received second-class honours in the second public examination of the school of modern history.<br>
<br>Sara Melhuish had extremely varied experiences as a teacher. From 1892 to 1895 she remained at Somerville as a lecturer and tutor in history. From 1895 to 1900 she was principal of the Mount Vale School, a private school in York. For the next four years she served as head of College Hall, the residence for women students attached to University College, London. In order to improve her knowledge of pedagogy she spent a term at the Maria Grey Training College in London and acted as a supervisor of teaching practice at the London Day Training College. She also taught in a county council school in Essex and as an occasional teacher in elementary and continuation schools. During this period she earned the London postgraduate teacher's diploma.<br>
<br>In 1907 Sara Melhuish returned to Liverpool, taking a post as lecturer in education and tutor to women students in the university's training college. She was responsible for the training of both elementary and secondary school teachers, for the organization and supervision of the practical work of all the women students and of some of the men students, and for lecturing on the history of education and principles of teaching. She also served as an examiner in education for the undergraduate degree and for the postgraduate diploma, and was a member of the faculty of arts, the training college board, the philosophy and education board, and other university committees. She even found time to teach a history form at Liverpool high school. Her colleagues praised her knowledge of the interrelationship of theory and practice, her familiarity with many types of schools, including elementary schools and their relationship with secondary schools, and her skill in maintaining relations with other university departments and with outside authorities such as heads of schools and local officials.<br>
<br>In 1910 Sara Melhuish took a position as head of the training department at Bedford College, University of London. The Bedford College training department, which had been founded in 1891, was a leading centre for training women graduates to be secondary school teachers. Supported by Department of Education grants, the department reached its height during Melhuish's tenure, with sixty students and a staff of four specialists. Melhuish was appointed university reader in education in 1915. A colleague recalled the Oxford-educated Melhuish's high standards:<blockquote>Miss Melhuish demanded of the students under her a standard of academic and professional excellence to which not all could attain, but which gave to the department a quality of its own in keeping with its position as belonging to a school of the university. (Tuke, 260)</blockquote>The training department, renamed the department of education in 1920, began to decline in the latter years of the First World War, and was closed for financial reasons in 1922, the year in which Melhuish retired. In 1930 she was appointed a governor of Bedford College. She died from a coronary thrombosis in German Street, Winchelsea, Sussex, on 23 October 1939 and was buried at Conduit Hill, Rye, Sussex, on 25 October.<br>
<br>Sara Melhuish was a well-respected proponent and practitioner of teacher education, as was shown in 1920 by her being given the opportunity to visit &#145;People's High Schools and rural technical schools for girls and young women&#146; in Denmark with the intention of possibly applying their methods to elementary schools in Britain. She was also something of a scholar, or at least an interpreter of historical scholarship. During the First World War she did part-time work in the historical section of the Foreign Office. She was the author of <span class="italic">English History Illustrated from Original Sources from the Earliest Times</span> (1911), part of A. C. Black's <span class="roman">School History</span> series, and was a contributor to the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> on the ecclesiastical history of Lincolnshire.<br>
