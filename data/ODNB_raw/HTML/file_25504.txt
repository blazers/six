<span class="headword">Siborne <span class="st"> [Siborn]</span>,  William</span>  (1797&#150;1849), <span class="occ">army officer and military historian</span>, was the son of Captain Benjamin Siborn of the 9th (East Norfolk) regiment, who was wounded at the battle of the Nivelle in the Peninsular War, and died while serving with his regiment at St Vincent in the West Indies on 14 July 1819. William Siborne was born on 15 October 1797 and educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned ensign in the 9th regiment on 9 September 1813. He joined the 2nd battalion at Canterbury, and accompanied it to Chatham in February 1815 and to Sheerness in the summer. In August he was one of those drafted to join the army of the duke of Wellington. Siborne was promoted lieutenant in his regiment on 8 November 1815, and at about that date he accompanied it to Boulogne as part of the British army of occupation. In February 1817 the regiment was reduced to one battalion, and Siborne was placed on half pay. He was brought back to full pay as a lieutenant in the 47th (Lancashire) regiment on 11 November 1824.<br>
<br>In March 1826 Siborne was appointed assistant military secretary to Lieutenant-General Sir George Murray (1772&#150;1846), commanding the forces in Ireland, and held the same appointment with Murray's successors, Sir John Byng, Sir Hussey Vivian, and Sir Edward Blakeney, until 1843. He was promoted captain unattached on 31 January 1840, and on the same date was placed on half pay, although he continued to hold the staff appointment of military secretary in Dublin.<br>
<br>Siborne published in 1822 <span class="italic">Instructions for Civil and Military Surveyors in Topographical Plan-Drawing</span> and in 1827 <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Topographical Surveying and Drawing</span>. He married, in 1824, Helen, daughter of Colonel Aitken of Todhall, near Cupar, Fife, and they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1830 Siborne was commissioned by the commander-in-chief to construct a model of the field of Waterloo. He lived for eight months at the farm of La Haye-Sainte on the field of battle, and made a survey of the whole ground, upon which he based his model. The execution of this work occupied some years, as Siborne devoted to it only such time as his professional duties permitted. In 1833 the progress of the work was interrupted by the refusal of the new ministry to allot funds for it. Thrown upon his own resources he continued the work until its completion in 1838, at a cost of nearly &pound;3000. The model was publicly exhibited in London and elsewhere, but the receipts barely covered the expenses of exhibition, and Siborne never recovered the cost of its construction. It was later the property of the Royal United Service Institution, then of the National Army Museum, London. Siborne also constructed a smaller model on a larger scale of a portion of the field of battle, and a <span class="italic">Guide to Captain Siborne's New Waterloo Model</span> was published. Having amassed much information from surviving officers on the battle and the entire campaign, Siborne in 1844 published his two-volume <span class="italic">History of the War in France and Belgium in 1815</span> (with folio atlas); it long remained a standard work.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1844 Siborne was appointed secretary and adjutant of the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea, and died there while holding the appointment on 9 January 1849. He was buried at Brompton cemetery. Siborne's second son, Major-General Herbert Taylor Siborne, born on 18 October 1826, edited in 1891, with explanatory notes, <span class="italic">Waterloo letters: a selection from original and hitherto unpublished letters bearing on the operations of the 16th, 17th, and 18th June 1815, by officers who served in the campaign</span>&#151;a selection from the letters his father received on the battle and campaign of Waterloo. The complete collection of letters became the property of the British Museum. Herbert Siborne died on 16 May 1902.<br>
