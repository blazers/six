<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pelham,  Henry Francis</span>  (1846&#150;1907), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21799/', "Thomas Pelham, second earl of Chichester (1756&#150;1826)")</script>, and eldest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21794/', "John Thomas Pelham (1811&#150;1894)")</script>, bishop of Norwich, and his wife, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 31 December 1893), second daughter of Thomas William Tatton of Wythenshawe Hall, Cheshire. Of his three brothers, John Barrington (1848&#150;1941) was vicar of Thundridge, Hertfordshire (1908&#150;14), and Sidney (1849&#150;1926) was archdeacon of Norfolk (1901&#150;16). Pelham was born on 19 September 1846 at Bergh Apton, Norfolk, then his father's parish. He attended Miss Hodgson's school, Brighton, and the Revd F. Storr's school in Kent. Entering Harrow School (Brooke Foss Westcott's house) in May 1860, he moved rapidly up the school, was three years in the sixth form, and left in December 1864. He was quiet, reserved, and apparently somewhat delicate in health. He was coached by a well-known scholar, the Revd North Pinder, rector of Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire, and formerly fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1865. He won an open classical scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford (matriculating on 22 April 1865); he went into residence in October. At Oxford he was prominent in the Claret Club, played in the cricket eleven, and was a fine walker. He gained firsts in classical moderations and <i>literae humaniores</i> (BA, 1869; MA, 1872) and was elected fellow of Exeter College in 1869. In 1870 he won the chancellor's English essay prize with a dissertation on the reciprocal influence of national character and national language. He was classical tutor and lecturer at Exeter College from 1870 until 1889, and proctor in 1879. Losing his fellowship on his marriage in 1873, he was re-elected in 1882, under the statutes of the second university commission.<br>
<br>From school onwards Pelham's principal subject was ancient and especially Roman history. He published articles on this (first in the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span>, 1876), while his Exeter intercollegiate lectures attracted increasingly large audiences. He also planned, with the Clarendon Press, a detailed history of the Roman empire, which he was not destined to complete. In 1887 he succeeded William Wolfe Capes as common fund reader in ancient history, and in 1889 became Camden professor of ancient history in succession to George Rawlinson, a post to which a Brasenose fellowship was attached. As professor he attracted even larger audiences. His research was stopped by cataracts in both eyes (1890), and though an operation subsequently restored most of his eyesight, he had to limit his reading. A few specimen paragraphs of his &#145;History&#146; were set up in type in 1888, but he completed in manuscript only three and a half chapters, on 35&#150;15 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, and never resumed the work after 1890; his other research, too, was thereafter limited to detached points in Roman imperial history. However, he joined actively in administration, for which his strong personality and clear sense fitted him. He helped to found the school of geography: he served on many Oxford committees&#151;including those of the Bodleian Library, Ashmolean Museum and geography school&#151;and was a member of the hebdomadal council, with two brief intervals, from 1879 to 1905. A reformer, he urged the use of college revenues for university purposes. Pelham was a prominent Liberal, active as such in the university and in the city. One of the few academic Liberals to support home rule for Ireland, he helped to organize Gladstone's visit to Oxford in 1890.<br>
<br>Pelham supported women's education in Oxford. In 1879, with Professor T. H. Green, A. H. Acland, and other Liberal dons, he was a member of the committee for a non-denominational women's hall which that year founded Somerville Hall (later Somerville College), then a member of its council&#151;fund-raising within the university&#151;its vice-president (1886&#150;93), and second president (1893&#150;1907). A benefactor of its library and an occasional tutor to some of its best students, he was a familiar figure at Somerville (his contribution, minimized in the 1996 college history, was acknowledged in its predecessor of 1922). He pressed for women's admission to Oxford lectures, examinations, and degrees. In 1886, unlike most Oxford Liberal dons, he did not become Liberal Unionist, and he long presided over the Oxford City Liberal Association. When president of Trinity he was especially concerned with its mission at Stratford, east London. In 1897 he became president of Trinity. He was elected FSA in 1890, and honorary fellow of Exeter in 1895, was an original FBA in 1902 and received an honorary LLD from Aberdeen in 1906. He was a governor of Harrow and other schools.<br>
<br>On 30 July 1873 Pelham married Laura Priscilla (<i>d</i>. 2 Nov 1918), third daughter of Sir Edward North Buxton, second baronet, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4247/', "Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, first baronet (1786&#150;1845)")</script>. They had three sons and two daughters, of whom one son and one daughter died young.<br>
<br>Pelham was both a scholar and a practical man, forceful, direct, sometimes showing &#145;aristocratic impatience&#146;  (Haverfield, xxii), and overstating his case, he disliked opposition, but was also warm and sympathetic to undergraduates. An excellent teacher, lecturing at a time when Oxford was widening its outlook and Theodor Mommsen and his school were recreating Roman history, he helped to revolutionize the study of ancient history in Oxford, and so in England. Moreover, combining organizing skills with an understanding of the needs of learning and the character of scientific research, he did much to develop Oxford as a place of research, while conserving its educational role. He was prominent in providing endowments for higher study and research, in introducing archaeology and geography to Oxford's ancient historical work, and in founding the British Schools at Rome and Athens. He helped to put natural science, English, and foreign languages on a more adequate basis in Oxford, and to give women educational opportunities there.<br>
<br>Pelham wrote little. His chief publications were <span class="italic">Outlines of Roman History</span> (1893), enlarged from his article in <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1887), and essays and articles on Roman history, of which the chief, with part of his unfinished &#145;History&#146;, were published in a posthumous volume of <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1911). Both books were considered to exhibit high historical powers. Pelham died in the president's lodgings at Trinity on 12 February 1907, and was buried in St Sepulchre's cemetery, Oxford. After his death his widow gave his library of works on Roman history and archaeology to Brasenose College, and his friends founded in his memory a Pelham studentship for Oxford men or women at the British School at Rome. His son, Sir Edward Henry Pelham (1876&#150;1949), was permanent secretary of the Board of Education (1931&#150;7).<br>
