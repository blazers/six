<span class="headword">Lancaster,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1700, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and satirist</span>, was born in Cheshire, though further details of his parentage and childhood are unknown. The earl of Cholmondeley was an early patron, and through him Lancaster was introduced to &#145;the exalted scenes of polished life&#146;  (Nichols, 2.379). In 1721 he was ordained deacon by John Wynne, bishop of St Asaph. At this time he was described as a &#145;literate&#146;, which indicates he did not have a university education but was considered sufficiently learned; before his ordination he made his living as a schoolteacher. In 1724 he was ordained priest by the bishop of Lincoln and was appointed rector of St Martin's, Chester, by Francis Gastrell, bishop of Chester, on 12 June of the following year. In January 1733 he was made chaplain to Frederick, prince of Wales, and on 12 February he was granted the degree of doctor of laws by the archbishop of Canterbury, a noteworthy distinction given his apparent lack of a university education and one that may have originated with the prince. Five days later Lancaster married the widow of Captain Brown, who brought with her an inheritance of &pound;20,000; they had two daughters. On 1 September 1737 he became rector of Stanford Rivers, near Ongar, Essex&#151;a crown living in Frederick's patronage&#151;where he remained for the rest of his life. Following Frederick's death Lancaster was appointed by the prince's widow, Augusta, as one of her chaplains in May 1751.<br>
<br>As a young man Lancaster had been a talented and witty conversationalist in polite society. In later years he turned to writing as a way of satirizing what he came to see as the excessive delicacy of modern manners. His treatise <span class="italic">The Pretty Gentleman, or, Softness of Manners Vindicated</span> (1747) offered a spoof defence of refined gentlemen such as the fictional fop William Fribble, recently satirized in David Garrick's play <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span>. Ostensibly a critique of Garrick's bluff tone, Lancaster's study was equally critical of what he saw as the enervated demeanour of overly delicate British manhood. Two further publications&#151;a sermon, &#145;Public virtue, or, Love of our country&#146; (1746), and <span class="italic">The Plan of an Essay upon Delicacy</span> (1748)&#151;addressed the same problem from different perspectives: the first offered a civic-minded call for public duty in the face of encroaching temptation, and the second a detailed guide to the correct ways for men and women to adopt a refined or delicate character. A similar dichotomy can be seen in Lancaster's work as a JP for Essex: a letter to the London bookseller Jacob Robinson tells how he frequently felt both compassion for defendants and a sense of duty to uphold the law  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1784, 345).<br>
<br>A man &#145;of strong natural parts, great erudition, refined taste, and master of a nervous, and at the same time elegant style&#146;  (Nichols, 2.379), Lancaster published only one further work, a long rhapsodical poem, <span class="italic">Methodism Triumphant, or, The Decisive Battle between Old Serpent and Modern Saint</span> (1767). Whatever else he wrote was regularly burnt, in a life which became increasingly reclusive and penurious. Indeed, so great was this indebtedness that after Lancaster's death, on 20 June 1775, the rectory was pulled down on account of the state of disrepair into which it had fallen during his tenancy.<br>
