<span class="headword">Lowick,  Robert</span>  (1655&#150;1696), <span class="occ">army officer and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was a Yorkshireman, born at Stokesley in the North Riding, into its small Catholic community, on 12 March 1655, son of Robert Lowick (<i>b</i>. 1624, <i>d</i>. after 1690) and, almost certainly, Mary Lowick (<i>d</i>. 1693?). His family were perhaps related to the extinct petty-gentry recusant Lowickes of nearby Osmotherley, and his 1696 indictment ranked him &#145;gentleman&#146;; but his father's house had only two hearths. The Benedictine monk Henry Benedict Lowick (<i>d</i>. 1720), who became prior of St Leonard's, Dieulouard, Lorraine, was probably Robert's brother; he had at least two other brothers and one sister&#151;perhaps four.<br>
<br>Under James II Lowick became ensign in the Catholic Sir Thomas Haggerston's independent company, commissioned on 26 June 1685 to garrison Berwick, afterwards incorporated into Sir William Clifton's regiment and by 1687 into the Royal Fusiliers. He was among the officers pardoned for Catholicism in November 1685. When the rich Catholic George Holman's new cavalry regiment was commissioned on 10 October 1688, Lowick was his cornet; but the regiment disbanded that December.<br>
<br>In Ireland in 1689 Lowick became a lieutenant in the cavalry regiment freshly raised for King James by Colonel John Parker. Lowick displayed, besides professional abilities, his characteristic humanity, particularly in saving captured Williamite officers' lives after a skirmish in June 1690. Parker's regiment was largely destroyed fighting at the Boyne. Lowick, having afterwards risen to major, returned to England in 1691.<br>
<br>From 1692 to 1694 Parker was organizing the Lancashire and northern Catholic gentry for a rising. He appointed Lowick major&#151;the professional officer's post&#151;in his own theoretical cavalry regiment. Since half its troops were scattered between Northumberland and southern Lancashire, and half in London, the post was burdensome, especially after Parker fled to France. Lowick lodged mainly in London.<br>
<br>In the 1696 assassination plot, Lowick, who was closely involved with Robert Charnock and Father Henry Joseph Johnston over regimental matters, bought a periwig to disguise Sir George Barclay. Lowick was to join the force attacking William and his guards, bringing two other horsemen&#151;unsubsidized by Barclay, he remarked. Like Ambrose Rookwood, he expressed disgust at the plot among comrades, but resolved to obey Barclay's orders, assuming that he acted on James's. Afterwards, two proclamations offered &pound;1000 for him among others, and he was arrested on 23 March in Golden Lane, London. Refusing inducements to confess, then or after condemnation, he was arraigned, with Rookwood and Charles Cranburne, in the court of king's bench on 14 April, and tried and convicted on 22 April. The main witnesses, the turncoat George Harris and Thomas Bertram, a relative from Stokesley whom he had often charitably assisted, showed uneasy consciences; but the government had reliable evidence of his complicity from an undercover spy. Lowick prepared a last paper in which, like earlier executed whigs and Jacobites, he used legal shortcomings in prosecution testimony to imply his moral innocence. However, when he, Rookwood, and Cranburne were executed at Tyburn on 29 April 1696, the sheriff's appeal to his piety, and guilt at having drawn others in, made him admit his knowledge and involvement.<br>
<br>A proclamation's description of Lowick&#151;tall, lean, of sanguine complexion, with high cheekbones and hollow cheeks&#151;calls into question the etching of the conspirators. Unmarried, he used his limited means charitably and was generally loved.<br>
