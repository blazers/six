<span class="headword">West,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1548&#150;1598), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was the son of Thomas West of Beeston, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of William Bradbury of the Peak, Derbyshire. He was descended from the Wests of Aughton near Sheffield, Yorkshire. He may have attended Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and on 25 June 1567 was licensed as a schoolmaster in the diocese of York, having been found sufficiently competent in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1568, then being of Darley, Derbyshire. He was not called to the bar, but practised as an attorney. By 1571 he had married Winifred, daughter of Adam Eyre of Offerton, Derbyshire; she was dead by 1596 at the latest. He subsequently married Audrey Mann, who also predeceased him. With his first wife he had five sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, William, was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1590. With his second wife West had one son.<br>
<br>From 1580 until 1597 West acted as steward of the court baron and of the manor court of Sheffield to George and Gilbert Talbot, successively earls of Shrewsbury, and is said to have made a fortune in the practice of the law. He was living at Rotherham, Yorkshire, by 1583, playing an important role in the town's administration, and by 1594 had purchased land at Firbeck outside Sheffield where he built Firbeck Hall. In 1590 he published <span class="italic">Symbolaeographia</span>, dedicated to Sir Edmund Anderson. Incorporating material from Thomas Phaer's <span class="italic">A Newe Boke of Presidentes</span>, first published in 1543, West's book was the first printed systematic treatise on the writing of legal instruments, including not only precedents in conveyancing but also of indictments and proceedings in chancery. West introduced his precedents with theoretical discussions of the relevant legal principles, drawing upon civilian and continental scholarship. The book, which came to be regarded as a work of authority, was useful and popular, and rapidly revised in two parts. The first part of the new edition (dealing chiefly with covenants, contracts, and wills) appeared in 1592 and was reissued with further corrections eleven times between 1594 and 1647. The second part of the new edition appeared in 1593, and again a further ten times between 1594 and 1641.<br>
<br>Shortly after the appearance of the <span class="italic">Symbolaeographia</span> West, &#145;being now minded to cease his practice and employ himself in study&#146;  (Davies, 1188), applied to be called to the bar by the Inner Temple. Letters were written on his behalf by Sir Christopher Wray, Sir Edmund Anderson, Sir John Puckering, and Mr Justice Beaumont, but it was resolved in November 1595 that call would not be permitted until he had performed the necessary learning exercises. Beyond the <span class="italic">Symbolaeographia</span> West produced an edition of Littleton's <span class="italic">Tenures</span> in 1581, and contributed a table to Richard Crompton's edition of Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's work on justices of the peace. West was ill by December 1597, and despite nursing by Elizabeth Grene, a widow whom he had intended to make his third wife, he died between June and August of the following year at Firbeck, where he was buried.<br>
