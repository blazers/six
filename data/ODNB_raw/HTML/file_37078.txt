<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Robert Arthur</span>  (1871&#150;1959), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 6 November 1871 in the Norfolk village of Hilborough, the only son of William Young, labourer, and his wife, Hannah Elizabeth Ann Fairs, who when registering the birth signed her name with a mark. After attending Westminster city school and King's College, London, Young became a medical student at the Middlesex Hospital. He obtained his BSc with a first class in physiology in 1891 and his MB in 1894, and he became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in a period when the quill pen was still used and the doctor carried his stethoscope in his silk hat. He was elected a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1897 and a fellow in 1905. After obtaining his MD, London, with gold medal (1895) and doing postgraduate work at Vienna, he settled in London as a consulting physician. He was appointed to the Middlesex Hospital, the Brompton Hospital, and later the King Edward VII Sanatorium at Fenhurst, near Midhurst. In 1912 Young married Fanny Caroline Phoebe (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of Robert Muirhead Kennedy, of the Indian Civil Service; they had one son.<br>
<br>A chest specialist at that time had to rely entirely on observation and the patient's story, aided only by the five senses. Of this personal technique Young became one of the greatest exponents medicine has ever known. He was incapable of superficiality and with extraordinary tenacity would relentlessly pursue each sign and symptom until he penetrated its meaning. Even when X-ray diagnosis became general, he never consulted the film until he had carried his personal methods as far as they would go.<br>
<br>In his large consulting room in Harley Street, which was over-furnished with cupboards and clocks, Young sat at an overcrowded desk and inscrutably pursued his remorseless clinical routine. Nothing was allowed to come between him and the patient, and he never gave up until he had used every available method and discovered all he needed. His remarkable clinical sense was built on memory and observation and he certainly understood that the physician's role includes giving not merely a diagnosis but some comfort and hope. His practice flourished long after he retired in 1936 from the Middlesex Hospital and even after the age of eighty he gave a sound opinion. Before George VI underwent an operation for lung cancer in 1951 Young was the leader in a group of eminent clinicians summoned to advise.<br>
<br>Young was chairman of innumerable societies and committees, notably the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis. He was an excellent leader, governing the proceedings with suavity and an extra sense of what was being thought round the table. He was an accomplished conciliator, adept in the formula which unites. Large affairs did not attract him, and he kept clear of medical controversies over the National Health Service.<br>
<br>Young had a rather hieratic manner, sedulously cultivated as a young man, which mellowed greatly in later life, though his speech kept a touch of unctuous sentiment belonging to an earlier period. He made a considerable fortune from medical practice in an age when this was an accepted measure of professional success. His private passion was collecting. Over the years a prodigious accumulation of china, glass, prints, clocks, and old instruments filled his rooms. He had not much artistic sense and preferred the quaint rather than the enduring. He cherished every object and nothing was ever allowed to go.<br>
<br>&#145;R. A.&#146; (as Young was affectionately known) was of medium height with a large, impressive head, and eyes which seemed to penetrate to the depths, though they also flickered with kindly reassurance. He never missed a medical banquet and kept up his committee work, full of industrious goodwill, until a week before his death.<br>
<br>Young's prodigious industry and impressive personal qualities brought him wide recognition. He was Harveian orator (1939) of the Royal College of Physicians; and both the Society of Apothecaries and the Royal Society of Medicine gave him their gold medals. He was appointed CBE in 1920 and knighted in 1947. He died in London on 22 August 1959.<br>
