<span class="headword">Bowie,  Malcolm McNaughtan</span>  (1943&#150;2007), <span class="occ">scholar of French and comparative literature</span>, was born on 5 May 1943 at 1 Hollesley Villa, Saxmundham Road, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, the elder of two children (both sons) of George Alexander Bowie (<i>b</i>. 1913), a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his wife, Beatrice Georgina (Betty), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Strowger (<i>b</i>. 1920). On discharge from the army his father trained as a psychiatric nurse and eventually, in partnership with his wife, became superintendent of a home for psychiatrically infirm elderly people in Aldeburgh. Bowie grew up in the Aldeburgh area; his secondary education was at Woodbridge School. Intrigued by the children's books his father had brought back from war service in France, he warmed to French at school and chose to study French and English at Edinburgh University. On 30 August 1964, while still a student, he married, at the West Central Liberal Synagogue, London, Eva Zwalf, a 21-year-old graduate student of English, and daughter of Meyer Zwalf, research economist. Having graduated with a first in 1965, he studied for a DPhil at Sussex University, focusing on the complex verbal and visual universe of the poet Henri Michaux, and thus launching a lifelong engagement with what he saw as the transformative power of poetic language.<br>
<br>While writing his thesis Bowie served for two years as assistant lecturer at the University of East Anglia (1967&#150;9), and was then appointed lecturer at the University of Cambridge and fellow of Clare College (1969&#150;76). At Cambridge he formed close associations with Lloyd Austin, the Drapers professor of French, and Alison Fairlie, fellow of Girton, leading scholars of nineteenth-century French poetry. These friendships continued to flourish after his appointment, in 1976, to a professorship at Queen Mary College, London. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 17 March 1979 he married Alison Mary Finch (<i>b</i>. 1948), daughter of Joseph Finch, schoolteacher. A fellow literary scholar, then carrying out pioneering work on Proust's manuscripts, Alison Finch had studied with Alison Fairlie at Girton and was a university lecturer and French fellow at Churchill College. The union was exceptionally happy and well balanced (Bowie was a natural feminist). They lived in Cambridge, Bowie commuting to London; they had a son, Sam, and a daughter, Jessica.<br>
<br>Bowie's second book, <span class="italic">Mallarm&eacute; and the Art of Being Difficult</span> (1978), confirmed his exceptional gifts as a reader of literary texts, while also revealing another of his enduring strengths, the conviction that the new critical theories emanating from Paris could contribute significantly to the understanding of complex literary works. While showing what Julia Kristeva, Roland Barthes, or Michel Serres could bring to the reading of Mallarm&eacute;, Bowie took up the challenge of interpreting the difficult and often abstruse psychoanalytic thought of Jacques Lacan for a non-specialist audience, providing an incisive essay in John Sturrock's <span class="italic">Structuralism and Since</span> (1979), and later a pellucid monograph, <span class="italic">Lacan</span>, in the <span class="roman">Fontana Modern Masters</span> series (1991). While from this point on non-doctrinaire psychoanalysis provided some of the impetus for Bowie's writing, his wide and eclectic reading in philosophy, art history, and musicology (music was an abiding passion) helped him forge a unique and multifaceted critical idiom. His remarkable virtuosity as a prose stylist emerged fully at this juncture, for example in the scintillating inaugural lecture he delivered at Queen Mary College in 1978, &#145;Proust, jealousy, knowledge&#146;, incorporated as a chapter of his third book, <span class="italic">Freud, Proust and Lacan: Theory as Fiction</span> (1987), where the three writers are seen as &#145;portraitists of the mental life&#146;  (p. 7) and as theorists of desire.<br>
<br>As head of the French department at Queen Mary, Bowie progressively involved himself in the affairs of London University while establishing his position as a figurehead for French studies in the UK, a role he retained for the rest of his life. From 1980 to 1987 he succeeded Austin as general editor of <span class="italic">French Studies</span>, the leading journal in the discipline, and also in 1980 became founding general editor of <span class="roman">Cambridge Studies in French</span>, a monograph series that, for the next fifteen years, published a stream of outstanding books (forty-two in all), each benefiting from his painstaking advice, and at their best characterized by the editor's own ability to combine meticulous scholarship with new critical vistas. In 1983 he was instrumental in the creation of the Modern Critical Theory Group and its journal, <span class="italic">Paragraph</span>, which became a leader in its field. He showed a similar dynamism when in 1989 he persuaded the University of London to establish the Institute for Romance Languages. Almost overnight the institute, subsequently subsumed into London's School of Advanced Study, was buzzing with the cross-disciplinary energies Bowie increasingly came to incarnate. Stepping down from the headship and other administrative burdens at Queen Mary, Bowie, as founding director (1989&#150;92), made the institute's premises on the third floor of Senate House his headquarters, presiding over a dazzling range of lectures and colloquia that brought world-class quality to the sometimes parochial world of modern languages in Britain.<br>
<br>In 1992 Bowie was appointed to the Marshal Foch professorship of French literature at Oxford and became a fellow of All Souls. From 1995 to 2002 he was actively involved in the recently established European Humanities Research Centre at Oxford, serving as director from 1998 to 2002, and setting up its imprint, Legenda. Under his guidance Legenda developed monograph series in various European literatures, including Yiddish, as well as in comparative literature, and became a leading academic publisher of outstanding work across modern languages and beyond. At All Souls, and in the sub-faculty of French, he organized numerous high-level research seminars, inviting distinguished critics to Oxford, including speakers at the annual Zaharoff lecture connected with the Foch chair, and the holders of the Weidenfeld visiting professorship in European comparative literature, which he helped to inaugurate. Once he had settled in, the family moved to Oxford, Alison becoming a fellow of Jesus, and then of Merton College. During his Oxford years Bowie was made a fellow of the British Academy (1993) and the Royal Society of Literature (1999) and served as president of the Society for French Studies (1994&#150;6) and the British Comparative Literature Association (1998&#150;2002).<br>
<br>Bowie's decade in Oxford saw the fruition of his many years of close study of Proust. Building on the insights of <span class="italic">Freud, Proust and Lacan</span>, and the essays collected in <span class="italic">Psychoanalysis and the Future of Theory</span> (1993), which include a marvellous chapter on the &#145;European unconscious&#146; that placed Freud in his cultural and historical context by way of interconnections with Mahler and Schoenberg, he progressively composed his masterly <span class="italic">Proust among the Stars</span>, published to great acclaim in 1998 and awarded the Truman Capote award for literary criticism in 2001. Bowie's <span class="italic">Proust</span> is the work of a supreme stylist. On page after page, elegant and enriching formulations of the essentials of Proust's achievement, gathered under plain headings (&#145;Self&#146;, &#145;Time&#146;, &#145;Art&#146;, &#145;Politics&#146;, &#145;Morality&#146;, &#145;Sex&#146;, &#145;Death&#146;), incite readers to refine their appreciation of the multitudinous ways in which Proust's alter ego charts &#145;the inscrutable inwardness of human desire&#146;  (p. 327). Bowie's contribution (on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries) to <span class="italic">A Short History of French Literature</span> (2003), co-written with Sarah Kay and Terence Cave, placed Proust in a wider context and demonstrated afresh the breadth as well as the depth of Bowie's knowledge of French literature (a breadth apparent from the beginning of his career in the range of his reviewing). At Oxford he was able to give full rein to his outstanding qualities as a doctoral supervisor. As Clive Scott noted, he &#145;encouraged in his students not only the adventurousness and fearlessness of his own thinking, but attention to the revelations of textual detail, and scrupulous scholarship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 5 Feb 2007). Scott added that &#145;there are many academic careers that have prospered thanks to his careful and caring guidance&#146;  (ibid.), an observation that applied more widely to the many younger colleagues for whom Bowie served as an ideal older brother, unfailingly generous with his time, sagacious in his advice, and delightfully amusing in conversation (as with everyone: a colleague remarked of him that he was able to make the most boring meeting seem fun).<br>
<br>In 2002 Bowie returned to Cambridge to be master of Christ's College, where he took pleasure in welcoming visitors to the college of Milton and Darwin and relished his role in spearheading the college's celebrations of its 500th anniversary in 2005. He proved a popular master, held in esteem and affection by fellows and students alike. But his tenure was short-lived. In 2004 he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an incurable form of cancer. A bone-marrow operation offered the possibility of lengthy remission but the disease returned and he stood down from the mastership two months before he died, at Arthur Rank House, a hospice in Cambridge, on 28 January 2007. His funeral took place at Cambridge crematorium on 7 February. He was survived by his wife, Alison, and their two children. In 2008 the Society for French Studies inaugurated an annual Malcolm Bowie prize for the best article published by a young researcher in the field of French studies.<br>
<br>The uncomplaining fortitude and good humour with which Bowie had carried on his work after the diagnosis were entirely characteristic. Visitors to the master's lodge observed the enduring delight he evidently took in the powers of literature, thought, and art, as well as the joy he derived from his family life. In the wake of his work on Mallarm&eacute; and Proust he had come to give increasing prominence to music and painting. In the outstanding programme notes he wrote for Covent Garden, essays on Mallarm&eacute; and Debussy, or Proust and Italian painters, or in his last publication, a magnificent review of books on the German Lied for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, he articulated a broad and generous vision of the humanities, whose cause he sought to advance with great urgency in his last years. &#145;Why Art Matters&#146;, the title of a symposium in his honour, held in Cambridge in December 2005, summed up the essence of Bowie's legacy. Through the power and originality of his intellect, the warmth and generosity of his personality, the flair and commitment with which he created contexts where research could flourish, and through the brilliance and humanity of his writing, Bowie was not only the leading figure in French studies of his generation but a scholar of lasting importance in the wider fields of literary and cultural study.<br>
