<span class="headword">Legh,  Richard</span>  (1634&#150;1687), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 7 May 1634, the second but first surviving son of Thomas Legh DD (1593/4&#150;1639), and his wife, Lettice (1610&#150;1648), daughter of Sir George Calverley, of Lea, Cheshire. Legh's father was the rector of Walton on the Hill and Sefton in Lancashire until his death on 27 May 1639. The death of his cousin Peter Legh on 2 February 1642, following a duel, left his childless uncle Francis heir to Lyme. When Francis died on 2 February 1643 Legh inherited the Lyme estates. Legh was educated at Winwick grammar school, where the presbyterian rector, Charles Herle, was a trustee of his uncle Francis's will. On 18 June 1649 Legh was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, and on 23 May 1653 he entered Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>Almost as soon as Legh came of age he was embroiled in county politics. The elections to the second protectorate parliament in 1656 saw Legh elected for Cheshire as part of a slate of gentry candidates agreed to by the new major-general, Tobias Bridge, because it kept the republican John Bradshaw out of the Commons. He was returned again for Cheshire in 1659. He was imprisoned in York in May 1659, and hence he avoided involvement in Sir George Booth's royalist uprising.<br>
<br>In the elections for the Convention of 1660 Legh supported the return of Booth for Cheshire and came in himself for the borough of Newton in Lancashire, where his family owned the dominant interest, Legh having strengthened it with the purchase of the barony of Newton for &pound;3500 in 1660. He was licensed on 31 December 1660 to marry Elizabeth (1642&#150;1728), daughter of Sir Thomas Chicheley of Wimpole, Cambridgeshire. The marriage took place on 1 January 1661. They had six sons and seven daughters, one son and two daughters dying young. Legh's estate was calculated at &pound;4500 p.a. when he was considered for the new order of knights of the Royal Oak, but an account book for 1662&#150;3 suggests a rental of &pound;2678 per annum. He was an inactive member of parliament, although generally a court loyalist, whom Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, labelled &#145;doubly vile&#146; in 1677&#150;8. He retired from parliament in 1679, but returned members of his extended family to the Exclusion parliaments. Legh was active in local affairs in the wake of the Rye House plot and Monmouth's rebellion. Following the accession of James II he returned his son, <a href="#cosubject_76725">Peter [<i>see below</i>]</a>, to parliament in 1685. Legh died at Lyme on 31 August 1687, and was buried on 6 September at Winwick. An inventory of the contents of the house at Lyme and its farm and stables totalled &pound;4179 14<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. His widow was buried at Winwick on 4 June 1728.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76725"></a><span class="headword">Peter Legh</span>  (1669&#150;1744), <span class="occ">politician and nonjuror</span>, was born on 22 August 1669, the fourth child and the first son of Richard Legh and Elizabeth Chicheley. He was educated privately at home, but as a child he was entered at Gray's Inn, on 2 February 1673. Legh survived an attack of smallpox in autumn 1683. His father ensured Legh's election to parliament for Newton in 1685, his maternal uncle, Sir John Chicheley, acting as chaperon for his first appearance in the chamber. His youth was remarked upon, and a motion made for the expulsion of minors, but no action was taken possibly because the earl of Plymouth's son, Thomas Windsor, looked even younger.<br>
<br>Legh was licensed on 21 December 1686 to marry Frances (1670&#150;1728), daughter of Piers Legh (<i>d</i>. 1671) of Bruche, Poulton, Lancashire, and his second wife, Abigail, and the heir of her half-brother, also Piers Legh, who had died in 1685. They had one son, who died in 1725, although Legh assumed responsibility for the upbringing of his own younger siblings. Legh was able to plead his youth in October 1687 when declining to serve as a deputy lieutenant under the Roman Catholic lord lieutenant, Caryll Molyneaux, third Viscount Molyneaux. Legh remained passive at the revolution in 1688, declining to support the adherents of the prince of Orange. He never stood for parliament again, and he refused the oaths to William and Mary. This political stance brought with it problems, such as the threat of double taxation and the possibility that the government would treat him as disloyal. In March 1694 he lost his place in the Lancashire commission of the peace. On 17 July 1694 Legh was arrested for treason in what was known as the Lancashire plot, following allegations by an informer, John Lunt. He was kept prisoner in Chester Castle until the end of August before being transferred to London, questioned by the secretary of state, Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, and sent to the Tower. He was then sent back to Chester where his trial collapsed for lack of evidence, Lunt and his accomplices having been discredited and no witnesses appearing against him on 24 October 1694. After this escape Legh made a deal with the only challenger to his electoral dominance at Newton, Thomas Brotherton, who had assisted his defence at his trial, and after that Legh was able to return without challenge two MPs for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Legh kept a low political profile but he was again incarcerated in Chester following the discovery of the assassination plot in 1696. Following the accession of Queen Anne, Legh returned to the commission of the peace, and in 1708 there was a concerted effort to persuade him to take the oaths, Sir William Dawes, bishop of Chester, holding several meetings with Legh. Legh was present at the decisive vote at the meeting of the group of Jacobite sympathizers known as the Cheshire Club which decided not to join the northern English part of the Jacobite rising of 1715, following which the members ordered their portraits to be painted to commemorate the wisdom of their decision. However, with several brothers implicated in the rebellion Legh found himself taken into custody again in September 1715, and in 1722 he felt it prudent to seek out the protection of Simon, first Viscount Harcourt.<br>
<br>Legh's wife died on 17 February 1728, and was buried at Winwick. In the absence of children Legh settled his estates on his nephews, the children of his deceased brother Thomas. Legh died in January 1744, being buried on 16 January at Winwick.<br>
