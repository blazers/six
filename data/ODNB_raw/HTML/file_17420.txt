<span class="headword">MacColla,  Alasdair</span> <span class="st"> [Sir Alexander MacDonald]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">clan leader</span>, was the third son of Col MacGillespie (<i>d</i>. 1647)&#151;also known as Coll Ciotach or Colkitto, names that many sources wrongly assign to his son&#151;and (probably) Mary MacDonald, who had been repudiated by her former husband, Ranald MacDonald of Benbecula. Alasdair's father was a claimant to chieftancy of the clan Ian Mor, the southern branch of the now fragmented MacDonald clan that had once dominated the lordship of the isles. Since the lordship had been abolished at the end of the fifteenth century other clans (above all the Campbells) had taken advantage of the weakness and internal feuds of the MacDonalds to build up their own power. Kintyre and Jura passed to the Campbells in 1607, and Islay too was handed over to them after a bitter succession feud among the Macdonalds led them into a confused rebellion. Coll Ciotach played a prominent part in these internal struggles that sought to save the clan's lands but instead hastened their loss, and emerged in possession of the island of Colonsay. Alasdair MacColla's youth was spent in this surviving fragment of the old MacDonald empire, doubtless with visits to his close kinsmen in Ireland, the MacDonnells of Antrim. In 1638 the earl of Antrim sought to exploit the conflict between Charles I and the Scottish covenanters by offering the king military help in Scotland in return for former MacDonald lands in Scotland. This provoked the earl of Argyll, as chief of the Campbells, into imprisoning Coll Ciotach and two of Alasdair's brothers, and driving the remnants of the family into exile.<br>
<br>Alasdair MacColla and his brother Ranald escaped to Antrim, and from there they led a small-scale and brief raid on Islay in November 1640. When the Irish uprising began in October 1641 Alasdair served as a captain in a regiment raised in Antrim to resist the rebels, but the tensions in a regiment which mixed Roman Catholic officers and men, like Alasdair, with protestants in fighting a war in which the two sides were largely defined by religious allegiance were intolerable. In January 1642 Alasdair and his co-religionists attacked their protestant colleagues and led local Catholics in joining the uprising. He commanded a force which won a notable victory at the battle of the Laney on 11 February, but soon eastern Ulster was occupied by an army from Scotland, the MacDonnell lands in Antrim being garrisoned by a Campbell regiment under Argyll's command. At Glenmaquin, co. Donegal, Alasdair persuaded the Irish commander, Sir Phelim O'Neill, to attack a protestant force on 16 June, and in the defeat that followed he was severely injured.<br>
<br>Alasdair's priorities lay, as always, in protecting his family and clan, and he now reconsidered his position. Alliance with the Irish had seemed a way of fighting the Campbells and regaining clan lands in Scotland and freedom for his father and brothers, but now the Irish cause was faltering. Alasdair and Ranald therefore negotiated a secret agreement with the earl of Leven (general of the Scottish army in Ireland) whereby they would desert the Irish and in return his relatives would be freed and family property restored. The brothers duly deserted, but their agreement with the Scots army soon broke down and they returned to the rebel cause, by one account because Alasdair was &#145;so generous as he would in no termes take service against the Irishes, with whom he had once syded&#146;  (Gordon, 64).<br>
<br>In 1643 Alasdair became involved in Antrim's plans to bring help from Ireland to Charles I against his English and Scottish enemies, and in November 1643 he led a raid on Islay and Colonsay. He was soon driven back to Ireland, but there Antrim gave him command, with the rank of major-general, of a mixed Irish and highland Scots expeditionary force which was intended to land in the west highlands and join Scottish royalists in war against the covenanting regime. He landed his troops (about sixteen hundred strong, far fewer than had been planned) in Morvern and Ardnamurchan in July 1644, but quickly found that he lacked credibility. His orders from the king were to join the marquess of Huntly, but the latter's attempt at a rising against the covenanters had been defeated months before, and even royalist-inclined chiefs were reluctant to rise in arms under a man whose previous landings had been failures, and whose arrival was seen as much or more as an Irish invasion than as a royalist rising.<br>
<br>Alasdair marched his men through the highlands in search of support, unaware that at the same time the royalist marquess of Montrose was making his way to the highlands hoping to find men to lead in a rising. When the two men learned of each other's movements is not clear, but they met in Atholl. The meeting was momentous. Montrose's leadership provided Alasdair's force with Scottish royalist noble leadership, providing a degree of respectability and credibility, while Alasdair provided Montrose with a body of veterans already in arms around which to build an army. It was to form the nucleus of the royalist army in the campaigns that followed. From September 1644 to August 1645 six successive victories were achieved, Alasdair himself playing a major part in all but one of them. However, difference in ambitions between the two men caused frequent tension. Montrose was fighting for the king, hoping to subdue Scotland then intervene in England to bring victory to Charles in the English civil war, whereas Alasdair and his men had specifically Irish and highland agendas. To Alasdair, the war was fought on behalf of family and to regain clan lands in Scotland. After the victories at Tippermuir (1 September 1644) and Aberdeen (13 September) Alasdair went back to the highlands on expeditions valuable to Montrose in that men were recruited to strengthen his army, but which he probably had no alternative to sanctioning, as such opportunities to wage war on the Campbells were the price of Alasdair's continuing support. At the end of 1644 Montrose at first planned to quarter for the winter in the lowlands, but Alasdair and his men persuaded him instead to undertake a campaign in the west. This culminated in the routing of the Campbells at Inverlochy (2 February 1645).<br>
<br>Alasdair played a central role in turning near defeat into victory at Auldearn (9 May), but was absent from Alford (2 July), being again in the west fighting and recruiting. He returned in time to fight in the last victory of the campaign, at Kilsyth (15 August), but the divergence between his and Montrose's objectives then contributed to disaster. Montrose, determined to break into England, moved south to the border, while Alasdair, though knighted by Montrose, insisted on taking most of his men back to Argyll to prevent any resurgence of Campbell power. The fact that he left 700 of his Irish troops with Montrose may indicate an element of compromise, and is perhaps a sign that Alasdair intended, as in the past, to rejoin Montrose after his foray. But Montrose's army was destroyed at Philiphaugh (13 September) and he was forced to flee back to the highlands to try to rebuild an army. Alasdair failed to rejoin him, choosing instead to continue his war in Argyll. When in mid-1646 Charles I (then a prisoner of the Scottish army in England) ordered royalist forces in Scotland to disband, Montrose duly went into exile, but Alasdair remained in arms. He had co-operated with the royalist cause, but now put clan ambitions first, refusing to surrender the lands in Argyll that he had overrun. In 1647 lowland covenanting forces combined with the Campbells in a campaign against him and his resistance disintegrated. Driven into Kintyre, he and some of his men escaped first to Islay and then to Ireland, while the remnants of his army were massacred.<br>
<br>Alasdair hoped to receive Irish aid for a prompt return to Scotland, but there was no hope of Irish confederates, now fighting for survival, engaging in another Scottish venture. Instead Alasdair was appointed lieutenant-general of Lord Taaffe's Munster army and governor of Clonmel. On 13 November 1647 Taaffe's army faced Lord Inchiquin's at Knocknanuss, co. Cork. Alasdair led the right wing in a successful charge and plundered the enemy baggage train, but the collapse of the rest of the confederate army then exposed him and his men to cavalry charges, and they were slaughtered or dispersed. Alasdair was evidently captured, but shot immediately after the battle by a junior officer, perhaps in a dispute over who should have credit for taking so important a prisoner.<br>
<br>Most accounts of the 1644&#150;5 royalist campaign in Scotland present Alasdair's role as a limited one: he was brave and a good leader in battle, but blundering and untrustworthy. He thus becomes a useful scapegoat for Montrose's occasional mistakes and final failure. Certainly his strategic vision was limited, and his focus on clan was frustrating to Montrose. But without Alasdair he would not have had an army, and there is strong evidence that the tactic that was to bring highland armies repeated success in the century that followed (up to the battle of Falkirk in 1746)&#151;the highland charge&#151;was developed by Alasdair from older Gaelic tactics. His men would drop their muskets after firing one volley, and charge their enemies with their swords, thus catching them off guard, as they were still struggling to reload their muskets, without (until the end of the seventeenth century) bayonets to defend themselves. It was such fast and wild highland charges, timed to bring tactical advantage, that won most of Montrose's battles.<br>
<br>In Gaelic sources Alasdair shares fully with Montrose in credit for the &#145;year of victories&#146;. In the words of Neil MacMhuirich the Gaels were &#145;the men who did all the service&#146;  (MacBain and Kennedy, 2.203), and Alasdair was their leader. The many tales that circulated for generations in Ireland and the highlands about his great size and strength, and the myths of supernatural signs that accompanied his birth and his deeds, are reflections of the status he achieved among his own people. Poets, male and female, sang his praises. Of his personal life all that is known is that, probably during the 1644&#150;5 campaign, he married a daughter of Hector MacAllister of Loup.<br>
