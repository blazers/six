<span class="headword">Shakespeare,  John Howard</span>  (1857&#150;1928), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, was born on 16 April 1857 in Malton in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the second of three children of the Revd Benjamin Shakespeare (1817&#150;1887) and his wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hithersay (1825&#150;1886). Both his parents were Baptists. His higher education took place in London between 1878 and 1883: he gained an MA in philosophy at University College and was trained for the Baptist ministry at Regent's Park College. In 1883 he was invited to the pastorate of St Mary's Baptist Church, Norwich, and soon gained a national reputation as a preacher and organizer. On 5 September 1883 he married Amy Gertrude Goodman (1862&#150;1960), the daughter of the Revd William Goodman and his wife, Mary. They had six children, the second of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59880/', "Sir Geoffrey Shakespeare")</script>.<br>
<br>Having been elected to the council of the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1885, Shakespeare made his mark when, in 1892, he delivered a paper appealing for greater co-operative efforts to be made in establishing new churches. In 1898 he was invited to become secretary of the union, taking up residence in Highgate, Middlesex. He immediately began to apply himself to the development of the Baptist Union as a strong, centralized organization directing the affairs of the denomination. His style of leadership was autocratic and the changes he made were rapid and far reaching. He raised a large national fund, primarily for the purpose of building new Baptist churches, and erected a London headquarters for the denomination that was opened in 1903. Previously disparate Baptist activities were increasingly brought under the umbrella of the union. In 1906 Shakespeare's first major work was published by the National Free Church Council, entitled <span class="italic">Baptist and Congregational Pioneers</span>.<br>
<br>Another major initiative spearheaded by Shakespeare was an attempt to facilitate the movement of Baptist ministers between local churches, and to support those who were in financial need. A significant part of his scheme, as it was eventually implemented in 1916, involved the division of Britain into areas, each overseen by a superintendent minister who was answerable to the union. Some saw this controversial step as the beginnings of episcopacy. Shakespeare was also largely responsible for the formation of the Baptist World Alliance, organizing its inaugural congress in London in 1905 and serving as its European secretary.<br>
<br>Shakespeare was, throughout his ministry, a keen advocate of Free Church unity, and was influenced by earlier leaders of the Free Church Council movement such as the Wesleyan Hugh Price Hughes. He wanted to increase the free churches' effectiveness and to raise their status. At the outbreak of war in 1914, supported by his fellow Baptist David Lloyd George, Shakespeare persuaded the War Office to allow new recruits to register as free churchmen and to commission Free Church chaplains. In December 1914 he created the United Army and Navy Board to nominate chaplains, and served as its chairman and secretary. Throughout the war he remained a loyal supporter and confidant of Lloyd George.<br>
<br>In 1916 Shakespeare was elected president of the National Free Church Council, and proposed the formation of a United Free Church of England. In 1919 the denominations agreed to come together into a federation, and the Federal Council of Evangelical Free Churches was formed, with Shakespeare as its first moderator. His views on church unity were expressed in his second major publication, <span class="italic">The Churches at the Cross Roads</span> (1918). In it he not only advocated Free Church union, but also made a plea for union with the Church of England. In October 1919 he was honoured for his contribution to the cause of church unity by the archbishop of Canterbury and the prime minister, together with many other church leaders, when a portrait in oils by John Collier and an illuminated address were presented to him. He also received an honorary DD from Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Shakespeare won the respect and co-operation&#151;and often the affection&#151;of those with whom he worked. He was passionate and energetic, frequently working for fifteen hours a day. He often appeared pale and drawn, and suffered from periodic bouts of nervous and physical exhaustion. In 1923 he came to believe his work was over, and retired because of ill health in 1925. He died following a stroke on 12 March 1928 at Fallowhurst, Bow Lane, Finchley, Middlesex, and was buried in the family grave at The Rosary, Norwich. In the tributes that were given at his memorial service in the City Temple in London, he was remembered for his dream of church unity, his statesmanlike leadership of the free churches during the war, his passionate commitment to supporting the Baptist ministry, and his creation of the Baptist Union as an effective national body.<br>
