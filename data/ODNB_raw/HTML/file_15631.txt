<span class="headword">Kinnaird,  Arthur Fitzgerald</span>, tenth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture and second Baron Kinnaird of Rossie  (1814&#150;1887), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15632/', "Charles Kinnaird, eighth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture (1780&#150;1826)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Olivia Letitia Catherine Fitzgerald (1787&#150;1858), the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9588/', "William Robert Fitzgerald, second duke of Leinster")</script>, was born at Rossie Priory, Inchture, Perthshire, on 8 July 1814. He was educated at Eton College (1829&#150;35) and afterwards received an appointment in the Foreign Office. From July 1835 to September 1837 he was posted to St Petersburg, where he served for a time as private secretary to the ambassador, the earl of Durham. In 1837 he became a partner in the banking house of Ransom &amp; Co., Pall Mall East, in succession to his uncle the Hon. Douglas James William Kinnaird. Eventually he became head of the firm, which took the name Ransom, Bouverie &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Kinnaird sat in the House of Commons for Perth as a Liberal (1837&#150;9), was re-elected for that city in 1852, and continued to represent it until January 1878, when he succeeded his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15635/', "George William Fox Kinnaird")</script> as Lord Kinnaird. In the House of Commons he supported free trade and spoke frequently on Indian questions. In 1857, in response to information given to him by protestant missionaries, he called for an inquiry into social conditions in Bengal. A devout evangelical (he underwent a conversion experience in Paris as a young man), he had an abiding interest in measures affecting religion and was a strong opponent of the bill for legalizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister. Like Lord Shaftesbury, with whom he worked on several charitable campaigns (including the education of ragged children), he also took a keen interest in all matters concerning the well-being of the working classes.<br>
<br>Kinnaird married Mary Jane (<i>d</i>. 1888), the daughter of the London banker William Henry Hoare, on 28 June 1843 at Hornsey [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15636/', "Kinnaird, Mary Jane")</script>]. Well matched, they worked in fruitful religious and social partnership. Their home at 2 Pall Mall East was a meeting place for social reformers and served as a clearing house of information for a host of evangelical causes, from district nursing and female education to foreign missions and temperance. As a leading light of the Gospel temperance movement, Kinnaird was instrumental in setting up coffee houses in working-class neighbourhoods. He was a man of considerable wealth, and contributed large sums of money to his favoured charities.<br>
<br>A familiar figure at the May meetings of the evangelical societies at Exeter Hall, Kinnaird sat on innumerable charitable committees. Among the public institutions with which he was more especially connected were the Church Missionary Society, the London City Mission, the Ragged School Union, the Ranyard Mission, the Destitute Children's Dinner Society, the Lock Hospital, Dr Barnardo's, the National Temperance League, and the Royal Society for Discharged Prisoners. Meanwhile, on his Scottish estates, he took a paternal interest in his tenants. He was, as one of his contemporaries put it, an example of &#145;the preserving salt of the British aristocracy&#146;  (Fraser, 141), a high-minded paternalist who helped to give Victorian Britain its reputation for moral seriousness. He died, after a long illness, at his London home on 26 April 1887, leaving one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50297/', "Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, the eleventh Lord Kinnaird of Inchture")</script>, and five daughters. He was buried in the churchyard at Rossie, Perthshire.<br>
