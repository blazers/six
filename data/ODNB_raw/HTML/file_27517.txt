<span class="headword">Tomkins,  Thomas</span>  (1743&#150;1816), <span class="occ">writing-master</span>, of whose birth, upbringing, or early life nothing is known, eventually kept a boarding-school in Foster Lane, Cheapside, London, where he taught writing and accounts to &#145;Young Gentlemen for Trades, Merchts. for Counting Houses and the Public Offices&#146;  (Heal, 108) and he was said to have been an excellent teacher.<br>
<br>Tomkins's known work as a writing-master was not extensive; he published only two engraved copy-books and both of these appeared in the early part of his career. The first was entitled <span class="italic">The Beauties of Writing</span> (1777), an expensive volume which sold for 15<i>s</i>., and this was quickly followed by <span class="italic">Alphabets Written for the Improvement of Youth</span> (1779); both contained a combination of plain and decorative writing exercises in a variety of styles. Apart from these copy-books, published in his own name, the mainstay of Tomkins's career was in producing ornamental penmanship for other people. Occasionally, he worked for publishers executing decorative titles for luxury publications such as Thomas Macklin's <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1800) or Rudolph Ackermann's <span class="italic">Microcosm of London</span> (1808&#150;10). In contrast to the work of early eighteenth-century writing-masters little of Tomkins's work was either intended for publication or ever engraved. Instead he specialized in producing unique presentation certificates and decorative transcripts of important texts and public addresses. Between 1776 and 1816 he was employed by the corporation of London to embellish the honorary freedoms that they distributed and it was through this channel that Tomkins's work was acclaimed by no less noble figures than Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and the dukes of Kent, Sussex, and Gloucester. He also transcribed the Royal Academy's annual addresses to the king and queen, turning these texts into highly refined examples of penmanship which his obituarist praised for their &#145;boldness of design, inexhaustible variety, and elegant freedom&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 280). In 1806 and 1807 Tomkins also turned his hand to authorship and his <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span> (1807) was successful enough to go through several editions.<br>
<br>In fact Tomkins's life is characterized less by his achievements as a penman than by his dogged determination that calligraphy should be recognized as one of the sister arts and that, consequently, he should be honoured with a place in the Royal Academy. Despite Isaac D'Israeli's rather censorious view that this belief rendered him &#145;the vainest of all Writing Masters&#146;  (D'Israeli, 436) a number of entries in Joseph Farington's diaries reveal how well liked Tomkins actually was. Of course, as a calligrapher he was never given the opportunity to run for the Royal Academy, but his involvement in a number of benevolent schemes, including the scheme to erect a monument to commemorate the engraver William Woollett, in 1796, led to his being invited to several of the Royal Academy's annual dinners. A naturally good humoured and sociable man, Tomkins was friends with celebrities such as Samuel Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Indeed, when Reynolds completed Tomkins's portrait in 1789 he refused to take any more than &pound;80 from &#145;a brother artist&#146;  (Heal, 109). According to one of Reynolds's first biographers, this compliment was extended when Reynolds, who signed few of his works, offered to give Tomkins &#145;&#147;a specimen of <i>my</i> writing&#148;, and immediately, [and] with the utmost freedom, wrote with his brush on the reverse of the canvas, &#147;J. Reynolds, pinx.,&#148; 1789&#146; (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 22 April 1928; portrait in the Guildhall, London). After suffering a long and painful illness, Tomkins died in September 1816 at his house in Sermon Lane, Doctors' Commons, London.<br>
