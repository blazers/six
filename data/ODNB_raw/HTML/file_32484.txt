<span class="headword">Coke,  Thomas William</span>, second earl of Leicester of Holkham  (1822&#150;1909), <span class="occ">agriculturist and landowner</span>, was born at Holkham Hall, the family seat in Norfolk, on 26 December 1822, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5831/', "Thomas William Coke, &#145;Coke of Norfolk&#146;, afterwards first earl of Leicester (1754&#150;1842)")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Anne Amelia (1803&#150;1844), third daughter of William Charles Keppel, fourth earl of Albemarle, whom he married when sixty-eight years old. Educated at Eton College and Winchester College, Coke received the courtesy title of Viscount Coke when his father became earl of Leicester at the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. He was a minor when his father died on 30 June 1842, when he succeeded to the earldom.<br>
<br>Leicester did not take a prominent part in politics or public affairs, but followed in his father's footsteps in his interest in agriculture and forestry. He devoted himself to the management and improvement of his vast estate. He continued to improve farm buildings and he rebuilt the estate workshops at Longlands. Model Farm was built to house his prize herd of Devon cattle. Between 1857 and 1859 the sea bank at Wells was constructed, completing the reclamation of the marshes between Wells and Holkham. Leicester was also a major investor in the Wells and Fakenham Railway between 1853 and 1857. A table appended to R. H. Rew's report on the agriculture of Norfolk, made to the second royal commission on agriculture of 1893, gave some instructive details as to the expenditure of money by the earl and his father in keeping up and improving the Holkham agricultural estate of 39,612 acres. The first earl spent in buildings and repairs &pound;536,992, and the second earl spent &pound;575,048 up to 1894&#151;in buildings, drainage, and cottages, &pound;377,771, and in the purchase of land for the improvement of the estate, &pound;197,277&#151;giving a total by both owners of &pound;1,112,040. The gross rents of the farms, which in 1878 were &pound;52,682, were only &pound;28,701 in 1894: a shrinkage of &pound;23,981 (45.5 per cent). In the year ending Michaelmas 1894 the disbursements on the estate were &pound;12,311, despite the earl's personal supervision over all the details.<br>
<br>Leicester married twice. First, on 20 April 1843, before he was of age, at Cardington, Bedfordshire, he married Juliana (1825&#150;1870), eldest daughter of Samuel Charles Whitbread (1796&#150;1879), brewer and astronomer, of Southill, Bedfordshire. They had four sons and seven daughters. Then on 26 August 1875, at Latimer, Buckinghamshire, he married Georgiana Caroline (1852&#150;1937), eldest daughter of William George Cavendish, second Baron Chesham, with whom he had six sons and one daughter. In his later years Leicester was thought of as a rather reserved, distant person of simple tastes, living quietly at Holkham. He must have been a striking figure with his flowing beard and wearing a wide-brimmed hat.<br>
<br>Leicester was a patron of agricultural causes and a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He was responsible for building more than 200 new cottages on the estate from the 1860s onwards, and he was not prepared to join with other landowners against trade unions. Although many were singled out for abuse from union platforms, Lord Leicester escaped.<br>
<br>In his younger days, Leicester made Holkham a social centre, hosting huge shooting parties at which the prince of Wales was a regular guest after 1865. He was responsible for rebuilding the coach house and stables and for laying out elaborate parterres and terraces around the hall.<br>
<br>Following a national trend, Leicester was one of a number of great agricultural landowners who began diversifying their assets. Beginning with local investments in the 1850s, by the 1870s he held shares in railways in Britain, Canada, Australia, and Argentina, and also in British companies producing agricultural products such as manure and farm implements. He also invested in companies using the products of British agriculture, such as those involved in brewing  (Wade Martins, 62&#150;3). He took little interest in politics, which he left to his younger brother, Edward, who was MP for West Norfolk from 1847 until 1852. At a public meeting in Norwich in 1886, he said, &#145;I have never been in the habit of taking part in political matters of an entirely party description&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, 30 Jan 1909).<br>
<br>The earl was nevertheless appointed on 1 August 1846 lord lieutenant of the county of Norfolk, and he held this appointment for sixty years, retiring in 1906, when he was succeeded by his eldest son. In 1866 he was made a member of the council of the prince of Wales, and in 1870 he became keeper of the privy seal of the duchy of Cornwall; he retired in 1901 on the accession of King Edward VII. On 30 June 1873 he was made KG on the recommendation of Gladstone. He was in politics a whig of the old school, but rarely attended the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Leicester maintained his health until 1905. He died at Holkham of heart failure on 24 January 1909, and was buried there on 28 January. His second wife survived him, dying in 1937. The earl was represented as a young man on one of the bas-reliefs (&#145;Granting a lease&#146;) of the monument erected in the park by public subscription in 1845&#150;50 as a memorial to his father.<br>
