<span class="headword">Wood,  Charles</span>  (1866&#150;1926), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born on 15 June 1866 at 11 Vicar's Hill, Armagh, the third son and fifth child of fourteen children of Charles Wood (1833&#150;1893), lay vicar of Armagh Cathedral and diocesan registrar of Armagh, and his wife, Jemima Taylor. A chorister at Armagh Cathedral, Wood was educated at the cathedral school and he studied harmony and counterpoint (1880&#150;81) with Thomas Osborne Marks, the Armagh Cathedral organist. In 1883 he was awarded the Morley open scholarship in composition at the newly instituted Royal College of Music. At the Royal College of Music he studied composition with Hubert Parry and Charles Stanford, horn with Thomas Mann, piano with Frederic Cliffe and Franklin Taylor, and counterpoint with J. F. Bridge. Later he took lessons in composition exclusively from Stanford and in the organ as a co-second instrument. Wood remained at the Royal College of Music until 1889 owing to the continued renewal of his scholarship, even as a non-resident student, during which time he was appointed to teach harmony at the college (1888), and, with Stanford's encouragement, he won an organ scholarship to Selwyn College, Cambridge (also 1888). After five terms at Selwyn he migrated to Gonville and Caius where he was made a lecturer in harmony and counterpoint (1889) and elected organ scholar (officially becoming organist in 1891); later, in 1894, he became a fellow of the college. In 1897 he became university lecturer in harmony and counterpoint on the retirement of G. M. Garrett. At Cambridge, Wood took the degrees of BA and MusB in 1890 and those of MA and MusD in 1894. Besides playing an active part as organist at Caius, he assisted Stanford as conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society (1888&#150;94) and he was bandmaster of the University Volunteers (1889&#150;97). In addition to his work at the Royal College of Music he was an examiner for the Associated Board, which took him to Australia (1901&#150;2), was a founder member and vice-president of the Irish Folk-Song Society (1904), and was president of the Musical Association (1924). In recognition of his contribution to British musical life he received the honorary LLD from Leeds University (1904) and an honorary DMus from Oxford (1924).<br>
<br>Wood's underlying desire (so his pupil Dent claimed) was to write for the stage and the concert room; his student works at the Royal College of Music&#151;a string quartet (1885); a piano concerto (first performed under Stanford on 22 July 1886); a violin sonata (1886); a septet (1889); and an overture, <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (1889)&#151;would appear to bear this out. However, whether through the exigencies of his life as a teacher or organist or by the demands of choral commissions, his subsequent instrumental output was restricted to one extended symphonic work, <span class="italic">Patrick Sarsfield: Symphonic Variations on an Irish Air</span> (1899), modelled on Parry's <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span>, and a series of highly assured string quartets (published with an introduction by Dent in 1929), which evince his natural classicism, a strong if conservative concept of form, and a thorough, idiomatic understanding of writing for strings. His works for the stage were similarly slender&#151;two scores for the Cambridge Greek plays and two Dickens-inspired chamber operas&#151;and a full-scale opera <span class="italic">Pat in Fairyland</span> (with J. Todhunter) was only sketched. Between 1885 and 1904 Wood produced a series of cantatas modelled essentially on those of his mentors, Parry and Stanford: <span class="italic">On Time</span> (Cambridge, 1898) found a powerful precedent in Parry's <span class="italic">Blest Pair of Sirens</span>, while <span class="italic">A Ballad of Dundee</span> (Leeds, 1904) looked to the narrative designs of Stanford's <span class="italic">Revenge</span> and <span class="italic">Voyage of Maeldune</span>. His most original choral work was his setting of Whitman's <span class="italic">Dirge for Two Veterans</span>, cast in the mould of a funeral march. The <span class="italic">Dirge</span> represented the zenith of his admiration for the poetry of Walt Whitman, an admiration that earlier had produced a number of fine songs, including &#145;Ethiopia Saluting the Colours&#146; (1898). He also collaborated with Alfred Perceval Graves, not only in his earliest cantata, <span class="italic">Spring's Summons</span> (1885), but also in a series of publications of Irish folk-song arrangements that were very much in the manner and fashion of Stanford's collections.<br>
<br>Wood was subsequently best known, however, for his substantial contribution to Anglican church music. Though influenced by the symphonic aesthetic of Stanford's service settings, Wood was attracted more by archaic contrapuntal paradigms, which increasingly inform later works such as the evening service in F (<span class="italic">Collegium regale</span>, 1915) and the a cappella anthems &#145;Hail, gladdening light&#146; (1919) and &#145;Tis the day of resurrection&#146; (published 1927). A more intense antiquarianism, verging on the austere, is apparent in his two settings of the <span class="roman">Nunc dimittis</span> for R. R. Terry at Westminster Cathedral (both 1916), his communion service in the Phrygian mode (published 1923), and the <span class="italic">St Mark Passion</span> (1921), not to mention his utilization of metrical psalm tunes from Sternhold and Hopkins, the Genevan psalter, and plainchant. His interest in hymnody and carols (which produced <span class="italic">The Cowley Carol Book</span>, <span class="italic">The Cambridge Carol Book</span>, <span class="italic">An Italian Carol Book</span> and <span class="italic">Songs of Syon</span>) resulted from his close friendship with the scholar the Revd G. R. Woodward during the 1890s. Yet Wood was also capable of the most sumptuous romantic expression, as is evident in partsongs such as the canonic setting of &#145;Come, sleep&#146; by Beaumont and Fletcher (published 1908) and Shelley's &#145;When winds that move not&#146; (published 1913), as well as the two anthems for choir and organ, &#145;O Thou, the central orb&#146; (published 1915) and &#145;Expectans expectavi&#146; (1919).<br>
<br>On 17 March 1898 Wood married Charlotte Georgina (<i>b</i>. 1875/6), daughter of Captain Robert Wills-Sandford, Scots Greys, of Castlerea House, co. Roscommon. They had five children (two sons and three daughters), but the elder son, Patrick, was killed on active service in Italy with the RAF in 1918; the tragedy visibly affected Wood deeply. Owing largely to overwork and excessive travel, he was seriously ill with influenza in 1923 and he never fully recovered thereafter. After succeeding Stanford as professor of music at Cambridge in 1924, he held the position for only two years before dying from cancer in the Evelyn Nursing Home, Cambridge, on 12 July 1926. His wife survived him. He was buried in St Giles's cemetery on Huntingdon Road, Cambridge.<br>
