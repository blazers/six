<span class="headword">Arnold,  Thomas</span>  (1823&#150;1900), <span class="occ">literary scholar and teacher</span>, was born on 30 November 1823 at Laleham, Middlesex, the third of the nine surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/686/', "Dr Thomas Arnold (1795&#150;1842)")</script>, schoolmaster and clergyman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Penrose (1791&#150;1873), youngest daughter of the Revd John Penrose, rector of Fledborough, Nottinghamshire. Tom Arnold, as he was usually known, and his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/679/', "Matthew Arnold (1822&#150;1888)")</script> spent a year at Winchester College, their father's old school, and continued their education at Rugby School, where Dr Arnold had been a reforming headmaster since 1828. Tom Arnold found many reminders of Rugby when in October 1842 he went up to Oxford as a scholar of University College. Matthew was in his second year as an undergraduate at Balliol, their friend Arthur Hugh Clough was a junior fellow of Oriel, and Tom's tutor was Arthur Stanley, one of Dr Arnold's favourite pupils; he was already at work on his life of the great headmaster. At Oxford, Tom, like Matthew and Clough, lapsed from Dr Arnold's Anglican orthodoxy, though throughout his life he remained preoccupied with religion. He adopted radical and republican ideals in politics, and Clough was said to have reproduced aspects of his character in the radical poet Philip in <span class="italic">The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich</span>. Tom was milder than Matthew, and better looking; his dark, sensitive features, derived from his mother's Cornish family, made him known as &#145;the handsomest undergraduate in Oxford&#146;  (W. T. Arnold, 118). In 1845 Arnold graduated with a first in classics (a better degree than either his brother or Clough attained). He could have stayed on with a fellowship, but he had had enough of Oxford.<br>
<br>In London, Arnold briefly studied law at Lincoln's Inn, then worked in the Colonial Office. But he was restless and in November 1847 he set sail for New Zealand, where his father had bought some land. He spent two years in that country, farming and teaching, and in 1850 moved on to Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) to become inspector of schools. A few months later on 13 June 1850 he married Julia Sorrell (1826&#150;1888), the beautiful daughter of the registrar of the colony's supreme court. Their first child, Mary, born in 1851, became famous as the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36736/', "Mrs Humphry Ward")</script>. They had eight more children, including the journalist and author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30458/', "William Thomas Arnold")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58174/', "Ethel Margaret Arnold")</script>, also a journalist, and one child who died in infancy. Tom Arnold was committed to his work, but after a few years he was unexpectedly converted to Roman Catholicism, a move which horrified his wife and alienated public opinion in the colony. He gave up his post in 1856 and sailed for England with his wife and young family.<br>
<br>Arnold had been corresponding with Newman, then rector of the recently founded Catholic University in Dublin, who offered him the position of professor of English literature. Arnold accepted, and worked in Dublin for five years. The institution did not prosper: Newman wanted a centre of international scholarship, while the Irish bishops were concerned with local needs. Tom Arnold was a dedicated teacher but found life there increasingly difficult, especially after Newman left Ireland in 1858. He could barely support his family, and early in 1862 he left to become senior classics master at the Oratory School, which Newman had started in Edgbaston, Birmingham. During these years Arnold was active in periodical journalism, particularly for <span class="italic">The Rambler</span> and its successor the <span class="italic">Home and Foreign Review</span>, the liberal Catholic journals edited by Sir John (later Lord) Acton. In 1862 Arnold published <span class="italic">A Manual of English Literature, Historical and Critical</span>, a useful and well-researched book which went into several revised editions during the rest of the century. He also edited medieval manuscripts from the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> and collections of historical and literary material.<br>
<br>Roman hostility to Acton's kind of liberal Catholicism provoked another religious crisis; in 1865 Arnold resigned from the Oratory School, and let it be known that he could no longer accept the authority of the Catholic church. Greatly to the satisfaction of his wife and other members of the family, he returned to Anglican practice. He and his family moved to Oxford and he set up as a tutor, renewing his old university acquaintances such as Benjamin Jowett, and doing well enough to build a large house in the Banbury Road, now part of Wycliffe Hall.<br>
<br>After a few years, though, Arnold's Catholic tendencies reappeared; Newman had perceptively described him as having become a non-practising Catholic rather than a protestant. In 1876 Arnold told his family that he intended to return to the Roman Catholic church; his wife was once again horrified. In that year, also, Arnold was a candidate for the Rawlinson chair of Anglo-Saxon. His edition and translation of <span class="italic">Beowulf</span> (1876) made him a strong contender, but he thought it necessary to inform the electors of his return to Rome. This move cost him the support of the high-church faction and he was not elected. It has been generally assumed that Arnold wantonly threw away a prestigious and well-paid appointment; his wife thought so, but the outcome of the election was never certain; the successful candidate, John Earle, was an accomplished Anglo-Saxon scholar, and some had regarded him as the favourite from the outset. But Arnold's statement hardly helped his cause.<br>
<br>After this crisis Julia could no longer bear to live with Arnold, and he retreated to London. The marriage became semi-detached; he supported his family as best he could and regularly visited them in Oxford, where Julia had moved to a smaller house and took in boarders. In London Arnold scraped a living by journalism, editing, and examining for the civil service commission. But in 1882, following an initiative by Newman, he returned to Dublin as professor of English at University College, as the Catholic University had become. He was also a fellow of the Royal University of Ireland, though that was no more than an examining body. His wife refused to lived in Dublin, so he still had the expense of maintaining two homes. One of his new colleagues was Gerard Manley Hopkins SJ, professor of classics, whom few people then knew to be a great poet. In 1884 Arnold published <span class="italic">A Catholic Dictionary</span>, which he had written with W. E. Addis; like his <span class="italic">Manual of English Literature</span> it ran into many editions and was reprinted up to the 1920s.<br>
<br>In 1888 Julia Arnold died of cancer; despite their conflicts, the Arnolds had remained in love, and her husband was with her when she died. On 8 January 1890 he married Josephine Benison (1831&#150;1919), an Irishwoman and an old family friend. The couple made a home in Dublin, where Arnold's final years were spent serenely. He continued teaching until his death, and once marked an undergraduate essay by the young James Joyce. In 1900 he published <span class="italic">Passages in a Wandering Life</span>, a pleasant, bland autobiography. Arnold linked, at some cost to himself, the dominant English culture represented by Oxford and his distinguished family, and the small, growing, and quarrelsome subculture of Victorian Catholicism. According to the writer of the <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary, &#145;his steadfast pursuit of high aims, his gentle nature and his exquisite old-fashioned courtesy made him greatly beloved&#146;.<br>
<br>On 12 November 1900 Thomas Arnold died at his home at 16 Adelaide Road, Dublin, of congestion of the lungs and heart failure. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery on 15 November.<br>
