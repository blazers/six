<span class="headword">Woolrych,  Austin Herbert</span>  (1918&#150;2004), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 18 May 1918 at 34 Albert Road, North Marylebone, London, the elder son and first of the three children of Stanley Herbert Cunliffe Woolrych, businessman, and his wife, May Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood. Educated at Westminster School, he showed early promise of academic distinction but the family's straitened financial circumstances during the economic depression prevented him from going on to university.<br>
<br>For four years Woolrych worked as a sales clerk in Harrods at the princely salary of &pound;1 per week. Nevertheless his lifelong love of adventurous travel found early expression in 1938 when he rode a bicycle to Venice, covering 1100 miles in seventeen days and crossing four Swiss mountain passes. His dreary occupation came to an end with the outbreak of the Second World War. He had already joined the Territorial Army and so was drafted immediately to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. There Woolrych's abilities were swiftly recognized and he was commissioned into the Royal Tank regiment in March 1940. On 24 September 1941 he married Muriel Edith Rolfe (1916/17&#150;1991), daughter of Walter Henry Rolfe; they had two children, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1945) and Richard (<i>b</i>. 1948). In 1943 Woolrych was promoted captain and posted to the Middle East. He fought at the battle of El Alamein, where he received a wound to his eye that might well have prevented his future career as a scholar. He served in the army for six years and for a time thought quite seriously of becoming a professional soldier. But although he never quite lost a military formality of manner, he realized that an army career would leave much to be desired. Moreover, an ex-service grant would enable him to acquire the university education he had missed ten years earlier. He applied therefore to read English at Pembroke College, Oxford. He was accepted, but was persuaded to study history instead, there being no English tutor at the college at this time.<br>
<br>After only seven terms Woolrych graduated with first-class honours in history and went on to write a BLitt thesis on the last years of the Cromwellian protectorate. In 1949 he joined the history department of Leeds University and after fifteen years there was appointed founding professor of history at the new University of Lancaster in 1964. With characteristic modesty he later said that by modern standards his meagre list of publications at this stage of his career would not have qualified him for a chair. This may be true, but if so the loss to Lancaster would have been great indeed. From the beginning his workload was enormous. He was faced with designing and teaching new degree courses as well as attendance at committees whose wide-ranging agenda covered all aspects of the new university. His experience of army selection boards served him well when selecting staff and students for a rapidly expanding department and his preference was always for dedicated teachers who were also talented researchers. For four years from 1971 he was the university's pro-vice-chancellor for college and student affairs, an appointment he later described as &#145;a hot seat&#146; that he was not sorry to vacate  (&#145;Pembroke historian's run of luck&#146;).<br>
<br>The price paid for these years of teaching and administration was that a number of intended books remained unwritten. Even so, in the early days at Leeds, Woolrych published <span class="italic">Battles of the English Civil War</span> (1961) and a military biography of Oliver Cromwell (1964). His highly regarded introduction to Milton's prose works in the Yale edition of 1974 was written while he was head of the department in Lancaster. However, in the early 1980s he gained more time to write with his election as a visiting fellow of All Souls College, Oxford (1981&#150;2), and a Commonwealth visiting fellow to universities in Australia and New Zealand in 1983. He published five times as many words during his last twenty-six years as he had in his first sixty. Despite there being a royalist ancestor among the Wolryches buried at Quatt in Shropshire, Austin's interest and sympathy continued to be Cromwellian. <span class="italic">Commonwealth to Protectorate</span> (1982) rescued Barebone's Parliament from the royalist myth that it was merely a fanatical rabble, and five years later he published his study of the politicized Cromwellian army, <span class="italic">Soldiers and Statesmen: the General Council of the Army and its Debates, 1647&#150;1648</span>. In 1986 Lancaster awarded him the honorary degree of DLitt and in 1988 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In the late eighties Woolrych's work was halted again by his wife's increasing ill health and he cared for her devotedly until her death in 1991. The next decade saw a return to research and writing on what he described as his &#145;blockbuster&#146;, <span class="italic">Britain in Revolution, 1625&#150;1660</span>, on which he worked for fifteen years and which was published in 2002. In an article for <span class="italic">History Today</span> timed to coincide with the book's publication he gave a masterly summing up of the shifting scholarly perspectives on the civil wars and revolution during the past fifty years. He staunchly defended the schools of narrative and military history&#151;practised by the likes of Veronica Wedgwood and S. R. Gardiner&#151;to which he himself belonged and helped to make respectable again. &#145;Today&#146;, he wrote, &#145;one need not be ashamed of telling a story, so long as it is as true as one can make it&#146;  (&#145;Shifting perspectives&#146;).<br>
<br>For his eightieth birthday friends, former pupils, and fellow historians presented Woolrych with a book of essays, <span class="italic">Soldiers, Writers and Statesmen of the English Revolution</span> (1998). The title was intended to echo one of his own titles, but it was also apt at a deeper level: he too had been a soldier in a fierce conflict, had needed statesmanlike qualities in handling the new order in the universities, and was a writer to the end of his life. The contributors to the volume were united to an unusual degree in their affection and respect for the rigorous scholarship and the unfailing kindness and courtesy of the man they honoured. Woolrych was fond of quotations&#151;&#145;old men ought to be explorers&#146; from T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Four Quartets: East Coker</span> was a favourite&#151;and in his old age he travelled the world from China to Peru, visiting five continents after his seventy-fifth birthday. But equally he loved and walked the Pennine and Lakeland hills among which he had made his home (at Burton in Kendal, near Carnforth). He had an extraordinary talent for friendship, a passionate love of music, and was a considerable connoisseur of wine. Another favourite quotation, from Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, sums him up very well: &#145;I love everything that's old; old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wines.&#146; Austin Woolrych died from heart failure on 14 September 2004 while on holiday in Tias, Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, and was cremated after a memorial service at St James's Church, Burton in Kendal. He was survived by his two children and was honoured posthumously at Lancaster University with an archive in the library, a student bursary, a memorial lecture, and a new courtyard all in his name.<br>
