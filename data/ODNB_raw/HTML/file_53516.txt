<span class="headword">Solomon,  Edward <span class="st"> [Teddy]</span></span>  (1855&#150;1895), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 25 July 1855 at 29 Ann Street, Waterloo Road, Lambeth, London, one of the eleven children (of whom five or six survived to maturity) of Jewish parents, Charles Solomon (1817/18&#150;1890), musician, and his wife, Cesira Marinina Mirandoli (1834&#150;1891), sometimes called Sarah. Family life revolved around the music halls where his father worked as a pianist, conductor, arranger, and composer. Having helped in the orchestra pit from infancy, Edward rapidly graduated to accompanist and then musical director, first with touring companies and then at West End theatres. He married the fifteen-year-old Jane Isaacs in 1873 but deserted her after fathering a daughter, the actress Claire Romaine (1873&#150;1964).<br>
<br>With great facility Solomon started composing humorous songs and one-act operettas in emulation of Arthur Sullivan and Robert Planquette. His scores contained echoes not only of music hall but also of traditional ballads, a stylistic influence encouraged by his principal librettist, the Irish journalist Henry Pottinger (Pot) Stephens (1850&#150;1903). Their first full-length collaboration was <span class="italic">Billee Taylor</span>, a &#145;nautical comic opera&#146; about a press-ganged gardener. Premiered at the Imperial Theatre in 1880, it became a favourite of Victorian audiences, especially the bass song &#145;All on Account of Eliza&#146;.<br>
<br>Teddy Solomon, a diminutive clean-shaven young man, was henceforth a recognized &#145;character&#146; in British musical theatre: whimsical, flamboyant, superstitious, hardly to be trusted with money or women, but brimming with melodic invention and able to compose at speed&#151;so long as somebody sat with him and sustained a conversation. Despite the high hopes of their backers, however, Stephens and Solomon could not match the extraordinary run of operetta triumphs concurrently registered by Gilbert and Sullivan. <span class="italic">Claude Duval</span> (1881) was a mild success, <span class="italic">Lord Bateman</span> (1882) a fiasco, and <span class="italic">The Vicar of Bray</span> (1882) offended some with its combination of clergy and corps de ballet.<br>
<br>While visiting New York in the winter of 1882&#150;3 to supervise Broadway productions, Solomon met the singer Lillian Russell (1861&#150;1922), whose real name was Helen Louise Braham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leonard. She supplanted Edith Blande as his mistress and sailed to London to perform in <span class="italic">Virginia and Paul</span>, the first of five shows that he composed for her. Its failure forced him into receivership in October 1883, citing liabilities of &pound;1400 and assets of &pound;75. After neither <span class="italic">Polly</span> nor <span class="italic">Pocohontas</span> substantially improved his finances, Solomon went in February 1885 to try them on American audiences, who responded enthusiastically to Miss Russell. They married at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 11 May 1885, a year after the birth of their daughter Dorothy, but the marriage soon went sour on account of extravagance, a hostile mother-in-law, intrusive press coverage, and professional tensions. Though <span class="italic">Pepita</span> fared well in 1886, <span class="italic">The Maid and the Moonshiner</span> flopped. Solomon displayed a cavalier attitude to contractual obligations. When sued by creditors for $4175 he absconded and never saw Lillian Russell again.<br>
<br>The police arrested Solomon for bigamy on his return to Britain in September 1886; he spent three weeks in prison and seven on bail before the case against him collapsed for want of American witnesses. Jane Solomon (who now sang on stage as Lily Grey) secured a divorce in January 1887. After a near-fatal bout of rheumatic fever left him too weak to work, he finally went bankrupt in May, paying 1<i>s</i>. in the pound. Even harum-scarum Teddy temporarily lost his cheery insouciance. Family and friends supported him through two grim unproductive years.<br>
<br>Solomon restored his musical reputation in 1889, when <span class="italic">The Red Hussar</span>, an operetta set in Queen Anne's time, ran for six months at the Lyric Theatre. Inured to civil court appearances, he saw off former creditors (who claimed the profits) and rival impresarios (who accused him of selling the rights to the score under three different titles). Undeterred, Richard D'Oyly Carte commissioned <span class="italic">The Nautch Girl, or, The Rajah of Chutneypore</span> (1891) for the Savoy Theatre. George Dance supplied the libretto about a temple idol coming to life in order to recover his stolen diamond eye. It received 200 performances, despite Bernard Shaw's complaint that one <span class="italic">Mikado</span> was enough for any reasonable generation. Carte followed it with a revision of <span class="italic">The Vicar of Bray</span>.<br>
<br>Resuming his career as a musical director, Solomon lived at 13 Albert Road, Regent's Park, London, with the actress Kate Everleigh. He collaborated with F. C. Burnand and Rutland Barrington on some short pieces but did not embrace the new lighter form of musical comedy. His death at 9 Sussex Mansions, Maiden Lane, London, on 22 January 1895 was due to typhoid. The burial took place three days later at the Jewish cemetery in Willesden. A versatile popular composer, Solomon appeared the brightest of Sullivan's satellites; <span class="italic">Punch</span> had seen &#145;Prince Edward&#146; as heir to &#145;King Arthur&#146; in the realm of British operetta. Within a few decades his music was all but forgotten.<br>
