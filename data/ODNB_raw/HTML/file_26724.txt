<span class="headword">Stuart <span class="st"> [Stewart]</span>,  Ludovick</span>, second duke of Lennox and duke of Richmond  (1574&#150;1624), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born in France on 29 September 1574, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26702/', "Esm&#233; Stuart, sixth seigneur d'Aubigny and first duke of Lennox (c.1542&#150;1583)")</script>, and his wife, Catherine de Balsac d'Entragues (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1631). He spent his early years in France but shortly after the death of his father on 26 May 1583 he was summoned to Scotland by his cousin James VI. Having surrendered his seigneurie of Aubigny to his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67529/', "Esm&#233; Stuart (1579?&#150;1624)")</script>, he was on 31 July confirmed by the king in his father's titles of duke of Lennox and Earl Darnley and in his offices and estates. As a symbolic gesture, acknowledging Lennox's place in the Scottish succession as heir to the throne (a position disputed by the Hamilton family, especially in the later 1580s), the duke carried the crown to the opening session of the parliament of May 1584; he bore it again at the opening of the 1587 parliament. The duke was placed in the care of John Graham, third earl of Montrose, and the king showed a continued interest in his education by appointing the well-regarded Dr Gilbert Moncrieff as his tutor.<br>
<br>Lennox continued to receive regular demonstrations of royal favour: in November 1583 he was made a gentleman of the bedchamber and great chamberlain for life; in July 1583 he received the lordships of Dalkeith (formerly belonging to Regent Morton), Methven, and Balquidder along with the teinds of the archbishopric of Glasgow (administered by his great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70056/', "Robert Stewart, earl of March and, formerly, earl of Lennox (1522/3&#150;1586)")</script>); and on 21 August 1586 he was granted the priory of St Andrews <i>in commendam</i>. In 1589 Lennox was considered &#145;a chyld of age, yet for his yeres wyese and wary, yea wyly&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, vol. 10, no. 311). In spite of his youth, the duke began to engage in political affairs&#151;as a privy councillor, and along with most of the rest of the Scottish nobility, he was granted a commission to pursue Jesuits and Catholics during the height of the Armada crisis in July 1588 and a number of days later he was given specific responsibility for guarding Dumbarton Castle and the Clyde approaches. Lennox was closely allied to the court party of George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, throughout the 1580s, but in 1589 he was active in support of the king against the Brig o' Dee rebels. From October of that year, when James VI was absent from Scotland for a period of eight months to get married, Lennox acted as governor of the kingdom and president of the privy council, with the assistance of Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, in Edinburgh and John Hamilton (subsequently marquess of Hamilton) on the border. The period of Lennox's governorship was notably peaceful with little disruption on the border and a conscious governmental effort to settle ongoing feuds between fractious noblemen, such as the northern earls of Moray and Huntly. On 20 April 1591 Lennox married Lady Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1592), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24375/', "William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie (c.1543&#150;1584)")</script>, with whom he had been having secret relations for some time: the day before the wedding, Lennox had forcibly removed Sophia from the protective custody of Wemyss Castle where she had been placed by James VI&#151;to the king's annoyance. The marriage was brief and childless.<br>
<br>Lennox's relations with his Stewart kin were complicated. He had been a willing part of a corporeal &#145;Stewart faction&#146; formed during the king's absence in 1590 and had allied with Bothwell and John Stewart, earl of Atholl, in actions against the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane, with whom he was regularly at odds. Above all, however, Lennox was loyal to his monarch and consequently returned to the king's chamber more swiftly than other members of the nobility during disputes. Lennox was credited as having the greatest influence over the king of any of the nobility, to the extent that a number of English agents attempted to discredit him or counteract his influence.<br>
<br>As chamberlain, Lennox was closely involved in court function and ceremonial and in May 1590 was at the forefront of the celebrations surrounding Queen Anne's arrival in Scotland and her coronation and ceremonial entry into the Scottish capital. In June 1590, less than two months after the king's return to Scotland, Lennox's growing stature was recognized when he replaced Francis, earl of Bothwell, as first gentleman of the bedchamber&#151;much to the frustration of the older man. Lennox benefited greatly from the disgrace of Bothwell (especially following allegations of the earl's involvement in witchcraft at North Berwick in April 1591), receiving the office of high admiral and large estates on the border and in Lothian. He also secured valuable links within the court after the marriage of two of his sisters to prominent noblemen, Henrietta to George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly (1588), and Marie to John Erskine, eighteenth or second earl of Mar (1592), although the proposed marriage of his third sister, Gabrielle, to Hugh Montgomerie, fifth earl of Eglinton (1598), did not take place and she retired to a French nunnery at Glatigny.<br>
<br>Lennox's former associations with the disgraced Bothwell soon led to allegations that the duke was collaborating with his kinsman, and was merely administering the earl's extensive estates on behalf of Francis Stewart's family. Although denied, these allegations resurfaced in the aftermath of the murder of James Stewart, earl of Moray, in February 1592, which Lennox was eager to avenge. Politically, Lennox found it expedient to re-associate himself with the Stewart faction and he was more willing to favour Bothwell openly. He obtained a grant of the ward of the young James Stewart, third earl of Moray (the murdered earl's son), and in June 1593 Bothwell was able to gain access to King James at Holyrood through the duke's stables. Along with the earls of Atholl and Mar and Alexander Lindsay, first Lord Spynie, Lennox interceded with the monarch to effect Bothwell's recovery of favour. Aware of James's unhappiness, however, Lennox again was one of the first to desert the earl and return to his monarch's side.<br>
<br>Lennox was active at James's side during the armed expedition against the rebel northern lords that followed the battle of Glenlivet in 1594. After the king returned south, Lennox was given a commission of lieutenancy over the north of Scotland to ensure its continuing quiet and was able to persuade Huntly and Erroll to leave Scotland for voluntary exile; he was also largely credited with persuading the king to demonstrate a lenient attitude to Huntly and his companions. The duke was granted the administration of the rebel earl's estates but, as formerly, he permitted the wives of the exiled lords to enjoy the profits of their lands. On 7 July 1598 he was given a lieutenancy over the island of Lewis and on 9 July 1599 this was extended to the whole highlands and islands. The highland west was the focus of Lennox's territorial holdings and this led to heated confrontations with the earls of Argyll and Mar in 1601 over the participation of Scottish troops in Irish warfare.<br>
<br>In 1598, probably on 3 September, Lennox had married Jean (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of Sir Mathew Campbell of Loudon and widow of Robert Montgomerie, master of Eglinton. The duke and duchess of Lennox had two children&#151;a boy (<i>d</i>. 1602&times;7) and a girl, Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1607&times;24)&#151;but were not suited to each other. By 1605 Lennox wished to divorce his wife and in September 1607 she was declared a rebel at the duke's petition for keeping his daughter from him and for mistreating her.<br>
<br>As an accomplished horseman, Lennox was a regular hunting companion of the king and in 1594, at the baptism celebrations for Prince Henry Frederick, was accomplished enough to win the prize for running at the ring and glove. He was present on a hunt with James when the king heard of the events that culminated in the Gowrie conspiracy of August 1600, and was active in backing his monarch against his former brother-in-law John Ruthven, third earl of Gowrie, who died during the confrontation. On 1 July 1601 he was sent as ambassador to France, ostensibly to renew the auld alliance, which had been in abeyance since 1560. Owing to Henri IV's opposition to this, Lennox was unsuccessful but on his return journey to Scotland he visited the English court, where he was entertained by Elizabeth for three weeks according to his position as the only non-royal duke in either Scotland or England at this time.<br>
<br>Lennox next returned to England in April 1603, in the company of James VI upon his accession to the English throne. The duke was appointed to the English privy council and was created first gentleman of the king's English bedchamber before James even reached his new capital. Although for the remainder of his life he was based at the English court, he rarely attended the privy council and, increasingly, his offices were more honorific than functional. Shortly after James's entry to London, Lennox returned to Scotland to remove Prince Henry Frederick from the care of the earl of Mar and place him in the care of Queen Anne, prior to their journey south to London. On 18 June 1603 he was naturalized as an English citizen, and on 23 July he was installed with Prince Henry and Mar as a knight of the Garter.<br>
<br>Lennox continued to accumulate honours in England: on 6 August he was granted the manors of Settrington, Temple-Newsam, and Wensleydale in Yorkshire along with a pension of &pound;600 a year. These lands had been part of the Lennox holdings in England held by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26497/', "Matthew Stewart, earl of Lennox and Lord Darnley (d. 1571)")</script>, and his countess while in English exile and had been unsuccessfully sought by James from Elizabeth through much of the 1580s and 1590s. In 1604 Lennox was again sent to the French court as ambassador for the king&#151;on his tomb he was called &#145;Captain of the Scots Gens d'Arms&#146; in France. On 31 August 1605 he was created MA of Oxford University, following a visit there in attendance upon James VI and I. In September 1605 he was appointed king's aulnager (inspector of woollen cloth) and on 13 August 1606, on the forfeiture of Lord Cobham, he received a grant of the manor of Cobham in Kent. At the funeral of Henry, prince of Wales, in 1612 Lennox was one of the principal supporters of Prince Charles, the chief mourner. In February 1613 he accompanied James's eldest daughter, Elizabeth, on the journey with her husband to the Palatinate and then continued to France as ambassador. Following his return, he was on 6 October created earl of Richmond in the peerage of England and Baron Settrington. In 1614 he was named deputy Earl Marischal, and in November 1616 he became lord high steward of the royal household. In the intervening period, Lennox had been part of the commission of inquiry for the trial of Robert Carr, earl of Somerset, and his wife for the alleged poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury and in October 1616 he had also officiated at the celebration surrounding the creation of Prince Charles as prince of Wales. In 1618 he was made king's aulnager in Ireland, in November 1620 he was appointed lord lieutenant of the county of Kent, and from May to July 1621 he was joint commissioner for the great seal.<br>
<br>Periodically, Lennox had returned to Scotland, as for example in July 1607, when he had been named high commissioner to the Scottish parliament in James's place. In 1617 he accompanied King James on his one return visit to the kingdom of his birth. Sitting in the Scottish parliament by heritage, in 1621 he voted in favour of the reforms of worship introduced in the unpopular five articles of Perth. Throughout much of his life, Lennox had been accused of lukewarm adherence to protestant doctrine. His close family were all Catholic and he was openly suspected of Catholicism on a number of occasions. Following the marriage of his sister to Huntly, these suspicions had grown in frequency and the duke had been excommunicated by the Church of Scotland; when absolution finally came in 1616 it was from the archbishop of Canterbury. For much of his later life, however, Lennox avoided serious political or religious confrontation as he was more content to play the role of courtier than administrator.<br>
<br>On 16 June 1621 Lennox married his third wife, Frances (1578&#150;1639) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70952/', "Stuart, Frances, duchess of Lennox and Richmond")</script>], daughter of Thomas Howard, Viscount Howard of Bindon, and widow successively of Henry Prannell and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25161/', "Edward Seymour, first earl of Hertford (1539?&#150;1621)")</script>. On 17 August 1623 he was created duke of Richmond and earl of Newcastle upon Tyne in the peerage of England. He died on 16 February 1624, suddenly, in bed at his home in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn, from &#145;a fit of apoplexy&#146;  (Crawfurd, 335). He left no legitimate heirs but an illegitimate son, Sir John Stewart of Methven, was keeper of Dumbarton Castle in the early 1620s. Parliament, which had been due to open that day, was postponed. On 19 April, with great ceremony, his body was borne from Ely House in Holborn to Westminster Abbey where he was buried, in King Henry VII's chapel, in a magnificent tomb, raised by his wife. His English titles became extinct; his Scottish titles descended to his brother Esm&eacute;.<br>
