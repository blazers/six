<span class="headword">Hills,  Henry, senior</span>  (<em>c.</em>1625&#150;1688/9), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was, according to a broadside of 1684, the son of a ropemaker in Maidstone, Kent; the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> characterized both this work and a similar tract of 1688 as &#145;scurrilous&#146; but Muddiman argued that &#145;nearly all their statements can be corroborated&#146;  (Muddiman, 5). It is possible that Hills was indeed from Kent as one of his apprentices was the son of a Henry Hills from Sevenoaks, although equally Hills may also have had links with Wales, from where no fewer than five other of his apprentices came. According to the 1684 broadside, just before the outbreak of the civil war Hills served under the future regicide Thomas Harrison, who &#145;put him out an Apprentice to a Printer for his better qualification to serve the <i>Cause</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">A View</span>). A marginal note named the &#145;printer&#146; in question as the London partnership of Matthew Simmons and Thomas Paine but, if this was the case, neither man formally bound Hills as his apprentice. Either way, Hills did not remain long with them but &#145;Lifted himself in the <i>Rebel-Army</i> under <i>Essex</i>&#146;, fighting &#145;fiercely&#146; at Edgehill  (ibid.).<br>
<br>According to the broadside, it was in the late 1640s that Hills began the series of political and religious tergiversations that made him one of the most notorious printers of the seventeenth century: &#145;He ever made it his business to be of the rising side, let what Card would turn up Trump, he would still follow the Suit, his Heart and Hand were also so well furnish'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">A View</span>). In summer 1647 he was printing for the New Model Army at Oxford with the printer John Harris. By the following year he was based in London at Southwark, where he had his first brush with the authorities, who ordered the seizure of a &#145;very dangerous book&#146; being printed by Hills  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1648&#150;9</i>, 7). In 1649 he was printing again for the army and also appears to have been made printer to the council of state; however, this did not prevent him from printing in the same year at least two editions of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> as well as a number of Leveller tracts.<br>
<br>Hills joined the Particular Baptist church of William Kiffin and in 1650 he was living openly with the wife of a Blackfriars tailor, Thomas Hams, although he was apparently already married. His conduct led to a fine and imprisonment in the Fleet, from where he wrote <span class="italic">The Prodigal Returned to his Fathers House</span>, recanting his crime and asking to be readmitted to the congregation; this work survives only in a reprinted form in <span class="italic">The Life of H. H.</span> (1688). The broadside of 1684 claimed that Hills went on to become both a printer and a preacher for the Baptist movement before misappropriating their funds, and he did indeed sign a letter from the London Baptists in 1653, as well as publishing many Particular Baptist works between 1652 and 1661.<br>
<br>According to the broadside Hills participated in the battle of Worcester of September 1651 and was seen in Lieutenant-General Charles Fleetwood's tent the day after the battle. If this is true, it was evidently not the first time that Hills had come to Fleetwood's attention: a month earlier the Stationers' Company of London received letters from Fleetwood, recommending Hills for the freedom of the company. Hills was accordingly freed by redemption (that is, by payment rather than apprenticeship) on 7 October. His imprints of this time do not often specify a location of his business but in 1652 he was at the sign of Sir John Oldcastle in Fleet Yard, while in the following year he appears to have moved his business to Pie Corner, just to the north-east of the city walls. When he bound his first apprentice in April 1654, he had moved further west, as he described himself as a printer in Aldersgate Street; he was probably already married to Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1666) as the first of at least four sons, <a href="#cosubject_69477">Henry Hills junior [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born to them about this time.<br>
<br>Hills's close relationship with Cromwell as both printer to the council of state and to the lord protector evidently aided him in his attempt, with John Field, in 1655 to secure a monopoly in printing English bibles and psalms, privileges that belonged to the king's printers (whose office had been in legal limbo since the civil wars) and the Stationers' Company respectively. In March 1656, despite protests from members of the trade, the company acceded to an order from Cromwell ordering it to register the rights of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with the two men. In July the two men also secured the right to print bibles for the university press at Oxford and in October they were elected to the company's livery. Their intimacy with Cromwell was such that they walked in his funeral cort&egrave;ge, while their long-standing position as printers to the government was evidently financially beneficial&#151;in April 1659, for example, the two men received almost &pound;2800 from the treasury.<br>
<br>The Restoration presented obvious new challenges for Hills. He seems to have been briefly imprisoned and was a suspected plotter against the king in 1662, but when the rights of Christopher Barker and John Bill to the king's printing office were reaffirmed, Barker almost immediately assigned his share to a group of stationers including, perhaps pragmatically, Hills. The history of the privileges related to the office of king's printer is particularly complicated in this period as shares were reassigned and subdivided, patents expired, and new reversions were granted. Nevertheless Hills not only remained as an assign for the rest of his life but in 1672 he bought a one-sixth share of the thirty-year reversion in the king's printing office that would come into effect with the expiry of the original patent in January 1680, while in December 1675 he and the manager of the printing house, Thomas Newcombe, received a thirty-year patent to begin following the termination of this reversion in 1710. In 1677 Hills and Newcombe were formally recognized as the king's printers. A year later Hills was elected to the governing body of the Stationers' Company.<br>
<br>Hills served as the company's under-warden for two successive terms between 1682 and 1684 and was in office when the company, along with most of the other chartered London livery companies, was forced to surrender its original charter in March 1684 as part of Charles II's policy of remodelling England's corporations. Hills was one of the few not to resign his position and his name was included on the fresh charter issued to the company in May 1684. He served as upper-warden for 1684&#150;5, a position he used to initiate a series of legal challenges against Oxford University Press regarding its printing privileges, which led to a new agreement between the company and the university in September 1685. It was also during his term of office and shortly after the accession of James II in February 1685 that Hills formally converted to Catholicism. However, despite his earlier professed conformity to the Church of England especially at the time of the new charter, it seems likely that Hills's Catholic sympathies dated as far back as 1666. On 14 April of that year, less than two months after the burial of his first wife, Hills married Elizabeth Versing, alias Knoff (<i>d</i>. in or after 1707), a widow of St Margaret's, Westminster, who later described herself as &#145;being born beyond [the] sea and bred a papist&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1694&#150;5</i>, 206). Together they had two further sons who, according to their stepbrother Henry, were &#145;brought up that [Catholic] way&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1690&#150;91</i>, 485). Significantly, three of Hills's children by his first marriage, including Henry, were baptized on 23 August 1681 at St Martin Outwich, Threadneedle Street, London, when they were all in their twenties, suggesting that they too had been brought up outside the Church of England, although probably as Baptists rather than Catholics.<br>
<br>The purges and counter-purges of London's liverymen by James II in 1687 had its impact on the Stationers' Company and as a result Hills became master of the company in October. He was re-elected unanimously the following June and remained in post until 27 November when a final purge restored the pre-1684 <i>status quo</i> and Hills was ousted. With William of Orange already landed in England, Hills evidently believed he would not be able to survive another change in national government. On 10 December 1688 he drew up his will and fled to St Omer; on the night of 11&#150;12 December an anti-Catholic mob &#145;destroy'd Mr. <i>Henry Hills</i> Printing-House; spoil'd his Forms, Letters, &amp;c and burnt 2 or 300 Reams of Paper, printed and unprinted&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Currant</span>, 2). Hills died at St Omer before 24 December 1689. His widow, Elizabeth, was convicted of recusancy in 1691; the Stationers' Company charitably turned a blind eye to the news, allowing her to retain her share, inherited from her husband, in the company's joint-stock venture. She surrendered this share only in December 1707 when she was noted as recently remarried.<br>
<br>The career of Hills's son <a name="cosubject_69477"></a><span class="headword">Henry Hills junior</span>  (<em>c.</em>1654&#150;1710<span class="mult">x</span>12)<span class="occ"></span> was almost as notorious as his father's. Following a request by the East India Company in January 1670 to &#145;send out an able Printer&#146; to Bombay to print &#145;some of the Ancient Braminy Writings&#146;, Hills was offered the post in April 1674. However, on his arrival in India, Hills's English types were not sufficient for the proposed printing so new types were cut locally by Indian metalworks; as a result, several sheets had been printed in &#145;the Banian character&#146; by January 1677, probably in Surat  (Primrose, 102). Hills evidently proved a disappointment: a letter from India to London dated 21 January 1679 described Hills as:<blockquote>not being found here anyways usefull in his profession &hellip; he hath given soe little content that it was thought convenient to discharge him &hellip; especially being at soe high a sallary as &pound;50 per annum and to doe nothing for it. (ibid., 102&#150;3)</blockquote>Hills was back in London by 7 July 1679 when he was freed by patrimony into the Stationers' Company and elected to the company's livery; he bound his first apprentice the following June.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1680 Hills, described as a bachelor of St Anne's, Blackfriars, and aged about twenty-six, married Mrs Ann Buckstone (<i>c</i>.1657&#150;1700&times;12), a widow of about twenty-three from St Mary's, Surrey, at the Charterhouse chapel. They baptized their first child, Henry, on 17 April 1681 at St Anne's and in 1695 they were noted as living in Holland Street in the same parish with three children; they were still in the parish in 1700. Hills seems to have begun printing books from about 1680. In November 1682 he borrowed &pound;100 from the Stationers' Company (in 1686 he was ordered to pay it back or find new sureties). He fined for the office of renter warden in 1687 and this seems to have been the highest company office he held; however, in August 1688 he successfully petitioned for the company to acknowledge his service as the messenger (that is, inspector) of the press and to receive an annual wage of &pound;10.<br>
<br>The events of 1688&#150;9 changed Hills's fortunes. His support of the new regime apparently estranged him from his father, whose will, although describing him as &#145;my welbeloved son&#146;, left him only a relatively small legacy as he had &#145;been by me advanced already&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/398, fol. 45<i>r</i>). In April 1689 the crown ordered the arrest of Henry Hills for high treason but whether this referred to father or son is unclear; the son was definitely back in favour with the authorities later in the year, as he was reconfirmed as the messenger of the press. Henry senior's will was proved on 21 January 1690 but the conviction of Henry senior's widow as a recusant and the bankruptcy of the other executor led to Henry junior's younger brother, Gilham, being granted both the administration of the estate on 18 September 1691 and his mother's share of his father's interest in the king's printing house. Effectively disinherited, Henry Hills petitioned the crown in 1691 and 1694 claiming that his father had forfeited his rights in the printing house because of his Catholicism; a further petition in 1698 went further, claiming that Gilham was supporting the Catholic side of the family with the profits from the king's printing house.<br>
<br>Hills's notoriety stemmed from his activities during 1708&#150;9 when he pirated a multitude of short literary works (including pieces by Dryden, Rochester, Congreve, Defoe, and Swift) and sermons&#151;all sold very cheaply and claiming to be published for the benefit of the poor. He even reprinted a run of <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. The bookseller John Dunton described him as &#145;that <span class="smallcap">ARCH-PIRATE</span> and hard'ned Wretch&#146;  (Bond, 264). However, the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1710 seems to have curbed his activities, although he did reprint his father's 1649 edition of John Lilburne's trial in that year. He died at some point before 29 March 1712, when his son Peter was granted administration of his estate; his stock was sold off in November 1713.<br>
