<span class="headword">Eaton,  Peter</span>  (1914&#150;1993), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born Peter Eton at 8 York Gate, London, on 24 January 1914. His father is unknown, but his mother was (Elizabeth) Maria Eton, who later married George Papp and lived in Hungary. Peter was advertised in the <span class="italic">Nursing Times</span> for fostering, and was brought up by John William Atkinson, electrical engineer, and his wife, Catherine Elizabeth Atkinson of 37 Haslam Street, Rochdale. For several years Peter's mother wrote confused and emotional letters to Mrs Atkinson which showed concern for the boy's welfare and education. In these she referred to Peter's father as &#145;in no way a reliable man&#146;, and to the fact that Peter &#145;has &hellip; Scotch and Irish and Hungarian blood in his veins&#146;  (private information). The Atkinsons adopted Peter on 25 April 1928, and in 1933 George Papp wrote to terminate the correspondence.<br>
<br>It was in Rochdale that Peter acquired his soft Lancashire accent and assumed the name Peter Eaton Atkinson. Asthma and the Atkinsons' poverty blighted his childhood, and he later described himself in campaigning literature as having been &#145;brought up &hellip; in the slums of Lancashire&#146;. Sunday school was an important influence, but his day school is unknown, and he left at fourteen to work for a Rochdale printer. Also about this time he attended art school, developing there his skill at painting and his lifelong interest in it as a collector. Promoted at sixteen from errand boy to machine minder, he took up a three-year printing apprenticeship, and joined the Typographical Association.<br>
<br>Catherine Atkinson died aged sixty-six on 12 January 1931, and her husband not long afterwards, and Peter then lived briefly and not very happily with their son George and his wife. An unusual career of self-help and self-improvement followed&#151;unusual in that it diverged from the conventional Victorian pattern because it contained elements of what can only be described as an anti-career, whose details he did not conceal in later life. Studying at the Municipal School of Technology, Manchester, for two days a week, he was (according to his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry) &#145;expelled&#146;, and did not complete his apprenticeship. None the less, self-education was taking place as he browsed in lunch hours among the books for sale at Shude Hill market in Manchester. He was also picking up socialist ideas, but of the Methodist rather than Marxist variety.<br>
<br>A second ingredient of the self-help career&#151;the search for opportunity through a move to London&#151;also featured: at twenty he walked there, and in later years liked to describe how the price of lodging at a Church Army hostel was to cut up firewood until his hands bled. He took several low-grade jobs, but also dabbled in bookselling, helped to found the Domestic Workers' Union, joined the Labour Party, and in 1937 the Peace Pledge Union, by which time he was living at 103 Hereford Road, Paddington. On 27 August 1940 a tribunal of three unanimously accepted his status as a conscientious objector, requiring him to work full-time on air-raid precautions work or on the land. He worked full-time for the London rescue squad from 1939 to 1946, occasionally also helping with bomb disposal.<br>
<br>Dealing in books on Saturday afternoons from 1945 at what was then Portobello Road's only bookstall, Atkinson soon found that this brought in more than his entire weekday income from the rescue squad. At this point luck gave a twist to his self-help career, for the late 1940s were a time when the book shortage invigorated the secondhand book market, and when the contents of many large houses were being cleared; in Kensington many of their occupants were selling off interesting collections. He had soon raised enough to rent his own premises and eventually moved up to a shop in Church Street, Kensington, where he got to know many interesting customers, some of them prominent figures on the left. From there he moved his shop to Notting Hill Gate, and thence in 1957 to Holland Park Avenue, by which time he was attending five or six auctions a week and networking widely among well-to-do owners of private libraries but also among sharp-eyed dustmen and rag-and-bone men.<br>
<br>Atkinson's family life also diverged from a conventional self-help pattern of respectability: his first marriage, on 31 May 1943, to Edith Laura (Ann) Wilkinson (<i>b</i>. 1916/17), telephonist, and daughter of Albert Wilkinson, tug boat operator, was dissolved shortly thereafter. With Valerie Carruthers he then had two sons, the elder of whom was named Russell, after Bertrand Russell. On 28 June 1948 he changed his name by deed poll to Peter Eaton, and on 23 February 1952 he married his second wife, Margaret Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1930/31), daughter of Henry Gordon Taylor, accountant, and his wife, Liliane Robinson. They later adopted two daughters, Ruth and Diana. Margaret Eaton looked after the firm's accounts, which freed up Peter's entrepreneurial flair, a quality more frequently combined with socialist belief than is often supposed. Eaton's consistently socialist commitment had no Fabian puritanical or gradualist component, and he stood at least three times without success as a Labour candidate for Kensington borough council. These were anyway no-hope contests, and as he hated committee work he would have been horrified to win. Politically he was a rationalistic and lifelong idealist who lacked the temperament which organizes sympathetic opinion: his was the principled stand from the floor which gave a headache to the organizers of many a meeting.<br>
<br>Yet in the book trade Peter Eaton was always a step ahead. This was partly because the autodidact's wide and rather indiscriminate reading made him knowledgeable about what was contained in the shrewdly purchased books that he sold, and he was well able to build up subject-based book collections in a scholarly way. These he sold to libraries overseas at a time when the foundation of many new universities boosted worldwide demand for out-of-print books. Among the beneficiaries were the Toike Library in Hitotsubashi University, Japan, for his collection on the co-operative movement; Riverside University, California, for his Marie Stopes collection; and the University of Ife, Nigeria, for his collection of books on the study of soil. His secondhand bookselling business boomed in the 1960s and 1970s, enabling him to travel widely on business at home and overseas. In acquiring Pre-Raphaelite paintings, too, he ran ahead of fashion, buying them just because he liked them; but at a time of rapid inflation, owning things was coincidentally prudent.<br>
<br>In 1975 Eaton moved into purpose-built premises designed by Rick Mather a few doors away from his Holland Park shop. In 1969 he and his wife had also acquired Lilies, a seventy-roomed dilapidated country mansion in Weedon, near Aylesbury, which in subsequent years they gradually restored. &#145;It was a crazy thing to do&#146;, he later recalled, &#145;but all I was concerned about was somewhere to put the books&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookdealer</span>). As events turned out, it was financially not crazy at all, but Eaton was no mere money-maker, and often gave away prize discoveries to suitable institutions. Feminist in outlook, he published with Marilyn Warnick in 1977 a fifty-nine-page indexed checklist of Marie Stopes's writings which grew out of listing items he had collected and sold. He also published <span class="italic">A History of Lilies</span>, a booklet which had gone into three editions by 1993; it discussed not only the house and its history, but also some of the treasures he had collected there.<br>
<br>Eaton's life centred increasingly on Lilies in his last years, and the Holland Park shop was let. From the hospitable lunch table that was central to social life at Lilies, family talk ranged widely over a host of subjects, and many visiting scholars, customers, and friends were entertained there. President of the Private Libraries Association from 1989 to 1992, Eaton was influential in the book trade, and influential, too, on those who got to know him. Tall, casually dressed, with hinged double-layered spectacles on a high forehead, and with unusually long earlobes, he was a prize individualist and breaker of rules and conventions. Inquisitive, argumentative, plain-speaking, and provocative, he listed his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as &#145;taking the dog for a walk&#146; and &#145;watching my wife play tennis&#146;. He was fond, too, of music, with an avant-garde taste for Mahler, and always said that the book for his desert island would be the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Heart problems from the late 1980s, however, forced him to sell parts of the Lilies estate, and he died of heart disease at Lilies on 23 October 1993. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, their two adopted daughters, and his two sons from his relationship with Valerie Carruthers.<br>
