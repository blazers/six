<span class="headword">King,  David</span>  (1806&#150;1883), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church</span>, was born on 20 May 1806 in Montrose, Forfarshire, the second son of John King (1762&#150;1827), minister of Second United Secession church, Montrose, and his wife, Eliza Young, daughter of a Montrose merchant.<br>
<br>King received his early education at primary and high schools in Montrose and entered Aberdeen University in 1820. After one year there, he transferred to the University of Edinburgh where he completed his arts course, displaying distinction in the classics and science. Preparing for the ministry of the United Secession church, he studied theology in Glasgow under Professor John Dick. On 10 February 1829, he was licensed by the presbytery of Forfar and ordained as minister of First United Secession Church, Dalkeith, on 13 January 1830. In the late summer of 1833 he was called to the large and influential congregation of Greyfriars Secession Church, Glasgow, in succession to Dick, his former tutor, and inducted on 15 October 1833. It was here, over a period of more than twenty years, that King exercised his most distinguished and effective ministry as a preacher and church leader in Glasgow. He married, on 27 December 1842, Elizabeth (1818&#150;1896), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27307/', "James Thomson (1786&#150;1849)")</script> and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of William Gardner of Glasgow. They had at least two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>King was renowned as one of the most outstanding church orators in Scotland during the middle years of the century, both in the pulpit and on the public platform. A biographer asserted that he inaugurated a new era in the preaching of seceders: &#145;He was eloquent, imaginative, polished, classic in style, and beyond all question intense. He was among the first of our preachers of any note who had the modern attraction of shortness&#146; (Joseph Leckie, <span class="italic">Life of Dr. King</span>, 45, cited in Woodside, 155). His preaching drew people from all over the city, including university students of all denominations, to fill his 1500-seat sanctuary. Under his dynamic ministry, Greyfriars established numerous mission and educational projects in the city and beyond. It financed a missionary station in Oban; began the first foreign mission to Trinidad of the Secession church; set up educational classes for young people in both religious and secular subjects, and was the first church in Glasgow to establish homes for poor boys.<br>
<br>In these years the great public platform in Scotland for the advocacy of political and social reforms was the city hall of Glasgow. King, along with other leading dissenting ministers of the time, was a popular speaker at public rallies in support of movements for progressive change. He was a strong supporter of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832 and the anti-corn law agitation  (Woodside, 217). He was a national leader in the anti-slavery movement, and was accepted as the representative speaker from Scotland at a meeting in Exeter Hall, London, in March 1838, held to press for the abolition of &#145;negro apprenticeship&#146;, a covert form of slavery  (Woodside, 216). In recognition of his great services to his church, the city, and the nation, the University of Glasgow awarded him the LLD in 1841.<br>
<br>The demands of ministering to a large congregation eventually undermined King's health, which was never robust. Suffering from nervous strain, he resigned from Greyfriars in March 1855, and went into semi-retirement in Kilcreggan, Dunbartonshire, a resort on the Firth of Clyde. However, his occasional preaching there soon resulted in the establishment of a new preaching point for his denomination. To accommodate the large numbers of summer visitors who flocked to hear him, a church sanctuary was erected in 1858, seating 440. Towards the end of 1861, King left this charge to lay the foundations of a new Presbyterian congregation in London in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater. On 26 January 1862 a new building with accommodation for 1000 worshippers was opened. At the 1863 synod of the United Presbyterian church he was chosen as moderator, and he spoke in favour of the union of English and Scottish presbyterian churches: he was a co-founder of the Evangelical Alliance. Once again, the heavy responsibility of ministering to a growing congregation took its toll on his health, and in April 1869 he returned to Scotland to take on the small charge of Morningside, then a quiet suburb of Edinburgh. It was hoped that with few duties beyond preaching, he could continue to exercise his still considerable gifts. But even with the assistance of many minister colleagues who often supplied the pulpit for him, his strength was unequal to the task. In February 1873 he resigned his charge and ceased all ministerial activity. After extensive travels in search of renewed health, chiefly in Italy, King returned to London, where he died on 20 December 1883.<br>
<br>King wrote several books, among them <span class="italic">The Ruling Eldership</span> (1845), <span class="italic">The Lord's Supper</span> (1846), <span class="italic">Geology and Religion</span> (1849), and the <span class="italic">State and Prospects of Jamaica</span> (1850), which he had visited in 1848&#150;9; he went to the United States and Canada in the same trip. However, his great gifts as a preacher overshadowed his reputation as an author: a volume of his sermons was published posthumously in 1885.<br>
