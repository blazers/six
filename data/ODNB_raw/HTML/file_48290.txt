<span class="headword">Julius Agricola,  Gnaeus</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Agricola]</span>  (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40&#150;93), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, was born of provincial stock on 13 June <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40 at Forum Julii (Fr&eacute;jus) in the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (Provence). His native city had been founded as a settlement of Roman citizens by Julius Caesar and refounded as a <i>colonia</i> by Augustus, with the title Colonia Octavanorum Pacata, to accommodate veterans of the eighth legion. Agricola's family name, Julius, probably indicates that Roman citizenship had been acquired through a forebear who had either served as an officer of Julius Caesar or Augustus, or achieved prominence as a rich and influential native inhabitant of Forum Julii. Agricola thus belonged to that sector of western provincial society which played an increasingly important role in urban administration and the manning of the ranks of army officers. This was a social milieu of relative affluence and was not devoid of cultural pursuits. Agricola's father, Lucius Julius Graecinus, achieved senatorial rank under Tiberius and was appointed praetor at the end of that reign. He had a taste for practical literature, writing on viticulture with learning and humour. His agricultural interests are probably reflected in the cognomen he gave to his son. Seneca had a high opinion of Graecinus as a man of principle, telling how he would not take favours from political figures of dubious reputation. High-mindedness was not a safe virtue in the reign of Gaius (Caligula). Having refused that unstable emperor's request to prosecute Marcus Silanus, Graecinus was put to death shortly after Agricola's birth, in circumstances which remain obscure. His tomb monument was apparently set up on the Esquiline Hill in Rome.<h2>
<a name="EducationandearlymilitarycareerinBritain"></a>Education and early military career in Britain</h2>Agricola's mother, Julia Procilla, bore a name which is suggestive of Gaulish descent, probably from landed stock derived from the tribal nobility. When Agricola reached the appropriate age for schooling his mother dispatched him to Massalia (Marseilles), the ancient Graeco-Roman city where cultural pursuits created a favourable climate for the education of the young provincial &eacute;lite in rhetoric and philosophy, the usual training for upper-class youth. As a senator's son, Agricola could aspire, if he wished, to imperial service. The first stage of that career, duty as a tribune of a legion, Agricola passed in Britain when he was eighteen to twenty years of age, under the governor Suetonius Paullinus. During the terrifying upheaval of the Boudiccan revolt in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 60 to 61, he served on the governor's own staff, where he must have learnt much about provincial administration and what could result from its abuse, as well as the conduct of military affairs in a far from quiescent part of the empire. The sequence of offices which followed in Rome was conventional enough: quaestor in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 64, tribune in 66, praetor in 68. But unusual duties fell to him during the civil wars of <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 68 to 70: under Galba the recovery of treasures stolen from temples, and under Vespasian the raising of legionary conscripts in Italy. That Agricola was viewed as a wholly reliable adherent of the Flavian cause of Vespasian is clear from his appointment in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70 as legate of the twentieth legion in Britain under the governor Petillius Cerialis. This regiment had recently been in turmoil, its commander being instrumental in driving out the previous governor of the province. Under Agricola's command the twentieth presumably took part in the major extension of Roman control in northern Britain which involved the conquest of the Brigantes of the Pennines and the Vale of York. Agricola's subsequent elevation to the ranks of the patricians and his appointment as governor of Aquitania, probably in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 75, reveals that his command of the legion had been effectively discharged and he was seen as an imperial servant who, still in his mid-thirties, could go much higher. Election as suffect consul for a few months in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 77 carried him into the pool of candidates from whom the holders of the highest military commands were drawn. Nevertheless, his appointment as governor of Britain, either late in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 77 or in 78, represented something of a leap, for he had governed no province which contained a legionary army and the military task which Britain presented was still great. No doubt Agricola's excellent knowledge of Britain, as well as his all-round competence, earned him this senior command. It is difficult to identify anyone who was better qualified.<h2>
<a name="TacitussAgricola"></a>Tacitus's Agricola</h2>Agricola had married Domitia Decidiana in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 62 and in 77 their daughter was married to <a name="cosubject_48305"></a><span class="headword">Tacitus</span> <span class="st"> [Cornelius Tacitus]</span>  (<em>b. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 56/7, <em>d.</em> in or after 113)<span class="occ"></span>, a young man then taking his first steps in official life. Since almost all that is known of Agricola is relayed by this writer, the position and outlook of the man are worth more than passing comment. Cornelius Tacitus was born of provincial stock in northern Italy or southern Gaul; the latter is more likely to have been his origin as his writing reveals a close knowledge of that province. He may thus have belonged to the same provincial circle as Agricola himself. His father was of equestrian rank (a step lower than the senatorial class), quite probably the procurator of Gallia Belgica. In the reign of Vespasian (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69&#150;79) Tacitus embarked on the usual minor magistracies held by the young Roman bound for the senate. He served as quaestor in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 81 or 82, either tribune of the people or aedile three years later, and praetor in 88. He should then have served as legate of a legion for about three years, but this phase in his career is not recorded. He next appears as consul in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97, when he was forty or forty-one. This succession of offices had been rapid for the son of an <i>eques</i> and there is no evidence that his progress had been slowed by changes in the Flavian regime. The later stages of his official career are largely unknown, but he attained the proconsulship of Asia (a small portion of western Anatolia), the pinnacle of the senatorial <i>cursus</i>, in 112&#150;13. His talents were not confined to the field of provincial administration. He was an outstanding orator and advocate; and by his early forties, if not before, he had begun his literary career. The <span class="italic">Agricola</span> was fairly certainly his first published work, compiled in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 97&#150;8, immediately before the <span class="italic">Germania</span> and immediately after his consulship. The circumstances of its writing&#151;the recent death of Domitian, the accession of Nerva, and the adoption of Trajan&#151;have left their mark on the tenor of the work.<br>
<br>As a source for Roman Britain, especially in the Flavian period, the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> stands alone. No other text provides a consecutive narrative from the invasion of Britain in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43 to the high-water mark of conquest in the north. But the very nature of the work and the purposes of the writer impose their own conditions on the use that can be made of it. The literary models for this form of biography are ultimately Greek, but a distinctively Roman tradition had evolved by Tacitus's day in which the qualities and character of the subject were given priority over historical context. While the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> is much more than a laudation of a distinguished life not wholly fulfilled, it is something less than a biography. Herein lies a central problem of interpretation. Much of the treatment is historical, especially in relation to early Roman Britain. In style as well as in content the work is reminiscent of the narratives of Sallust and Livy of the previous century. Nevertheless, Agricola and his achievements are the dominant theme; he is rarely absent for more than a sentence or two. Interwoven into the fabric of the text there are also themes and references relating to the final years of the first century. It is matter for debate as to how much should be read into these, how &#145;political&#146; were Tacitus's motives in writing as he did. Was the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> to some extent an apologia and a justification for the provincial &eacute;lite who had served Rome, rather than the regime of Domitian, in the previous two decades? Certainly there is a clear and deliberate contrast between the dedicated servant of the state and the paranoid despot whom he served. But there is more individuality in the delineation of Agricola than this. Tacitus had portrayed a man in his time, not with warts and all, but equally certainly not a stereotype of the good governor and soldier.<br>
<br>Given the primacy of the text, the debate on the reliability of the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> for its subject's governorship and for the wider history of Roman Britain in its first half-century will continue. Modern attitudes have ranged from acceptance tempered by caution to scepticism tempered by a measure of approval. On Agricola's work and achievements in Britain the account contains no obvious exaggeration or invention, even though the figure of Agricola naturally enjoys an enhanced status. There is general archaeological endorsement of the veracity of Tacitus in his account of the conquest of northern Britain, though it must be admitted that the geographical setting is very weakly presented. There is support, too, for the Flavian programme of urban and social development in Britain to which Agricola is said to have contributed and which is evident at London, St Albans, Cirencester, Silchester, Winchester, and elsewhere. There is no obvious discord between the archaeological record and the text of the <span class="italic">Agricola</span> as it relates to Agricola's own administration. The account of Britain before the Flavian period is more suspect. There is foreshortening in the chronology here and the work of governors in Nero's reign is not given its due. Some achievements and developments are omitted altogether. From the early Flavian period onward, however, when Tacitus himself began to hold offices of state, the work can be used with much greater confidence and not merely <i>faute de mieux</i>.<h2>
<a name="MilitarysuccessesMonsGraupius"></a>Military successes: &#145;Mons Graupius&#146;</h2>Agricola's arrival in Britain followed upon, and was evidently intended to continue, forward movement in the west and north, prosecuted by his predecessors Petillius Cerialis and Julius Frontinus. Agricola's first task was to complete the subjugation of the Welsh tribes. He was swiftly into action soon after his arrival in the province. The Ordovices of north Wales had all but annihilated a Roman cavalry regiment shortly before. The new governor struck deep into their territory, destroyed their military strength, and seized the rich island of Mona (Anglesey). This bold stroke was followed by the routine garrisoning of north Wales, thus completing the work begun by Julius Frontinus between <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 74 and 77. No further resistance by the tribes of Wales is recorded. The northern regions of Britain posed greater problems, of logistics as well as of conquest, and the campaigns conducted there by Agricola from <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 78 to 84 were arduous and demanding. They were also highly successful and must be ranked among the finest feats of the Roman army in the western provinces at any date. While it is self-evidently true that Agricola's reputation has been enhanced by Tacitus's account of his career, there is no serious doubt that his military operations in Britain were highly successful. In six years of campaigning, the tribes of northern Britain, from the Pennines to the southern fringe of the Scottish highlands, were subdued and their territory firmly held by strategic roads and garrisons. The culmination of this forward movement came in a pitched battle against the Caledonians at &#145;Mons Graupius&#146; in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 84, a site which cannot be identified with certainty, but which must have lain in the coastal plain of north-east Scotland, probably in what is now Aberdeenshire or Banffshire. Agricola's battle position was far from favourable, the Caledonian host having the advantage of higher ground. By allowing the Roman centre to engage the enemy on the slopes, however, he tempted the northerners to descend to lower ground where four regiments of cavalry held in reserve were able to rout and disperse them. Roman legionary forces were not called upon to join in the battle. Auxiliary troops alone carried the day. Against Roman losses of only 360, the Caledonians were said to have lost 10,000 men. After brief forays further north and a voyage to the Orkneys to receive the surrender of those islands, Agricola withdrew to winter quarters.<br>
<br>The Roman conquest of northern Britain had reached its highest point and so had Agricola's career. Shortly after the victory at &#145;Mons Graupius&#146;, he was recalled by Domitian and awarded the ornaments of a triumph&#151;the highest military honour he could have expected. He had been governor of Britain for seven years, an unusually long term for any province, especially one which contained so large a legionary army. His northern conquests were not to last for long. Pressures on other frontiers in mainland Europe, notably on the Danube, enforced a withdrawal of forces from Scotland. At the nodal point of his general disposition of forces in Scotland, Agricola had planned and begun the construction of a new legionary base at Inchtuthil on the Tay, possibly for his old legion, the twentieth. This base was largely complete when, in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 86 or at the latest in 87, the decision was taken to abandon most of the territory north of the Cheviot hills. The legionary base was given up and carefully dismantled, along with the auxiliary forts between the &#145;highland line&#146; and the Tweed basin. It is entirely credible, as Tacitus reported, that Agricola felt bitter about the turn of events. But no blame can be attached to him or to the emperor and his advisers for an enforced withdrawal from the northernmost conquests. The demands of frontiers under threat elsewhere could only be met by drafting in troops from secure provinces. That Britain could be so regarded was itself a measure of Agricola's achievement.<br>
<br>Probably a much greater disappointment was Agricola's failure to receive one of the commands which crowned the senatorial career: Syria, Africa, or Asia. Domitian, or a confidant, made it plain that he should not put his name forward for the proconsulship of Africa or Asia. This is not wholly incomprehensible. Most of Agricola's years of service had been spent in the specialized conditions of Britain, far removed from the civilities of old proconsular provinces. He may also have lacked powerful connections at court and there may be some truth in Tacitus's assertion that Domitian harboured jealous sentiments about Agricola's achievements. The emperor may well have felt that he had received honours enough in the ornaments of a triumph, a public statue, and a long, honorific citation.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Virtually nothing is known of Agricola's last years. He died nine years after his recall from Britain, on 23 August <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 93 after an illness. Tacitus reports a rumour that he was poisoned and hints, no more, at Domitian's involvement. In the fervid atmosphere of Domitian's later reign such rumours were frequent and there is no good reason for believing that this one held substance. Domitian (named as coheir in Agricola's will) had nothing to gain by removing from the scene a long-retired provincial governor.<br>
<br>Agricola the effective and successful general is a figure whose fame is secure. Agricola's merits and achievements as a provincial administrator are less easily assessed, as the account of Tacitus is almost all there is. His all-round competence is entirely credible. Whether or not he was possessed of greater talents is more difficult to ascertain. His origins in a western <i>colonia</i> may have made him more sensitive to provincial feeling than many of his Italian peers in the imperial service. His checking of abuses in the supply of grain to Roman forces may thus have been motivated by a sense of fairness, but it also made good administrative sense not to push newly subjected provincials too far. Similarly, his encouragement of Roman culture and education among the rising generation of British leaders may have been motivated as much by pragmatism as by a desire to Romanize the province. This was the social group upon which the further development of Britain would depend. There is evidence to support the statement of Tacitus that Agricola gave active assistance to the development of cities, though in this too he was building on the work of earlier governors. The famous dedicatory inscription for the forum at Verulamium (St Albans), dating to either <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 79 or 81 and naming Agricola, is striking confirmation of his general care for urban development, but this text records the completion of work which must have begun years earlier.<br>
<br>The personality of Agricola remains elusive; it could hardly be expected to emerge from Tacitus's encomium. The figure there depicted is somewhat bland and bloodless; an efficient subordinate rather than a born leader; a man of duty not vision. That judgement may seem harsh. To have served emperors as diverse as Nero, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, and to have passed through a civil war, were achievements which proved to be beyond many. Agricola's career may not have reached the topmost pinnacles of the imperial service, but he does worthily represent that large and significant body of provincials who served the Roman empire with competence and distinction. Few provincial governors are better known to us. None could better exemplify their all-round achievements.<br>
