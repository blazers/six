<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oates,  Titus</span>  (1649&#150;1705), <span class="occ">informer</span>, was born at Oakham, Rutland, a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62364/', "Samuel Oates (bap. 1614, d. 1683)")</script>, Baptist preacher, and his wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. in or after 1697), a midwife from Hastings. His father, son of a Church of England clergyman in Norfolk, was a radical preacher in several counties, including Rutland, in the 1640s and chaplain to Colonel Pride's regiment in the 1650s. At the time of the Restoration in 1660 the family was living in Hastings and decided to rejoin the Church of England, Titus and his brother Constant being baptized at All Saints' Church, Hastings, on 20 November 1660. Titus also had an elder brother, Samuel, and two sisters, Hannah and Anne.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Domestic violence and his father's dislike of him marred Oates's early life. He was later described as a dull, unlovable child who suffered from convulsions, a runny nose, and a tendency to dribble. In 1664 he attended Merchant Taylors' School in London as a free scholar under the tuition of William Smith, whom he later accused of playing a part in the Popish Plot. Smith found Oates a dullard and, discovering that Oates had cheated him of his tuition fees, subsequently expelled him. In 1665 he attended a school at Seddlescombe, some 6 miles from Hastings, and in June 1667 he went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he gained a further reputation for stupidity, homosexuality, and a &#145;Canting Fanatical way&#146;  (Elliot, 1&#150;2). Oates transferred to St John's College in 1669, but fared no better. He left Cambridge without a degree in 1669, but having become skilled in mendacity.<br>
<br>Oates falsely claimed to hold a BA degree and in due course the bishop of London licensed him to preach. Oates took holy orders at Ely in May 1670 and was made vicar at Bobbing in Kent in March 1673. His coarse temper and odd lifestyle soon caused divisions with the parishioners and he was dismissed from the living, returning to Hastings, where he became curate to his father, who had obtained the living at All Saints' about 1666. At Easter 1675 Oates accused the local schoolmaster, William Parker, of sodomy with one of his pupils. Oates wanted Parker's post but the accusation was false and resulted in Oates being bound over to appear at the next sessions on a charge of perjury. He fled to London and sought refuge as a naval chaplain in 1675 on the ship <i>Adventure</i> bound for Tangier. It was during his visit to Tangier, Oates later claimed, that he heard the first rumours of the Popish Plot that was to make his name. However, on his return to England in 1676 Oates was expelled from the navy for homosexual practices and went to London. There he took up with his father, who had left his living in the wake of the Parker affair. In August 1676 his former tutor William Smith met Oates in the company of a Catholic actor named Matthew Medburne. Shortly afterwards Oates was arrested and returned to Hastings to await his trial for perjury, but he escaped again and went back to London, where he renewed his acquaintance with Medburne and other members of a Catholic club in Fuller's Rents. Through this acquaintance, in 1676 Oates managed to obtain the post of chaplain to the protestants in the household of a Catholic nobleman, Henry Howard, earl of Norwich and future sixth duke of Norfolk. Although much admired for his theatrical preaching, he soon lost his position. In spite of his protestant upbringing, on 3 March 1677 Oates was received into the Roman Catholic church by Father Berry, alias Hutchinson, an apparently mentally unbalanced priest.<h2>
<a name="OatesandtheCatholics"></a>Oates and the Catholics</h2>There is little doubt that Oates's conversion to Roman Catholicism was insincere. He later wrote:<blockquote>I myself was lulled asleep, by the allurements of the Popish Syrenes, and the bewitching sorceries of the Man of sin &hellip; But as Joseph was sold to AEgypt for the Preservation of his Brethren, so was I laid aside, by the permission of Divine providence, for the safety both of my King and country. (T.O., 1)</blockquote>In reality he was probably motivated by the poverty in which he found himself, a craving for acceptance, and the potential for blackmail. Oates claimed that he soon became a prominent courier for the Jesuit order, but his conversion did little for his career and he remained unemployed. It was at this time that he was also introduced, via his father, to Dr Israel Tonge, an eccentric former clergyman and fervent anti-papist obsessed with the Jesuit menace and the author of several treatises on the subject. Oates proved ecumenical enough to sponge money from protestant as well as Catholic clergy, and willingly offered to co-author pamphlets with Tonge against the Catholics. In the role of a poverty stricken convert Oates also took to begging from the Catholic priests at Somerset House and repaid their kindness with theft: he stole some of the host, which he afterwards boasted that he used as wafers to seal his letters. In April 1677 Oates had his first good stroke of fortune in a meeting with Father Richard Strange, the provincial of the Jesuits in England, who arranged for him to attend the English Jesuit College at Valladolid in Spain. The reasons for this assistance are unclear. J. P. Kenyon speculated that Strange was also homosexual and consequently felt obliged to help Oates, but it may be that Oates, an accomplished liar, convinced Strange of his worth. By this stage in his career Oates had created a past for himself in which he was the former recipient of a rich benefice of the Church of England but had given it all up for the Church of Rome. Under the alias of Titus Ambrose or Ambrosius, Oates arrived in Bilbao in May 1677 and at the English College at Valladolid in June, where he was received by Father Manuel de Calatayud, who later noted:<blockquote>I admitted him, very much against the grain though it was &hellip; Little more than a month went by, and he was in so much of a hurry to begin his mischief that I was obliged to expel him from the College. He was a curse. What I went through and suffered from that man, God alone knows. (Williams, 49)</blockquote>While at Valladolid Oates met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1940/', "William Bedloe")</script>, his future partner in the plot. It is possible that he had known Bedloe during his time in the earl of Norwich's household. In Spain the pair were reacquainted before Bedloe stole some money from Oates and absconded for other adventures. The idea that they concocted most of the evidence of the Popish Plot at this point is unlikely, but their acquaintance was to be renewed in London in 1678.<br>
<br>Oates soon returned to England, claiming to have received a doctorate from the University of Salamanca. At the height of his fame he was ridiculed as the Salamanca doctor, but out of vanity he retained the spurious doctorate until the end of his life.<br>
<br>Oates resumed his begging lifestyle until Father Strange decided once more to indulge his odd client and arranged for him to attend the Catholic seminary at St Omer in December 1677. Oates, travelling under the name of Samson Lucy, swiftly revealed both his ignorance and unsuitability for the school; the institution found great difficulty in accommodating the 28-year-old tobacco chewing, foul-mouthed, and coarse tempered Oates. He was disliked by most of the students, one of whom &#145;broke a pan about his head for recreation&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 10.1110).<br>
<br>While at St Omer, Oates begged to be admitted to the Jesuit order and to keep him quiet was briefly sent to another Jesuit seminary, where he caused so much trouble that he was sent straight back to St Omer. His private investigations also allowed him to learn much (and invent the rest) about the order's councils in England; although his later claim that he was trusted to carry their correspondence is highly unlikely. He also claimed that he attended a significant Jesuit &#145;consult&#146; in London in April but in reality he was at St Omer until June 1678, when he was in fact expelled from the seminary by the new English Jesuit provincial, Father Thomas Harcourt, alias Whitebread. In July 1678 a desperate Oates returned to London and promptly renewed his acquaintance with Israel Tonge. It was once suspected by many historians that Tonge was the prime mover of the Popish Plot evidence that followed and indeed that it was Tonge who prompted Oates. In fact Oates, the stronger character, had his own bitter need for vengeance against those who he now believed had continually slighted him and Tonge became merely a sounding board for his own crude prejudices.<br>
<br>Initially Oates sought only to regale Tonge with tales of his own desperate struggles with the papists and even flattered the older man into believing that Tonge was a target for Jesuit vengeance due to his writings against the Catholics. Tonge asked him to write it all down and Oates, eager to have an audience, did so. In forty-three articles or depositions Oates revealed for the first time the nature of the so-called Popish Plot. He claimed to have been informed at various times by rather garrulous, or plainly stupid, Roman Catholics of plans to murder Charles II and his brother James, duke of York (unless as a Catholic the latter agreed to the plot), by bullet or poison. A number of attempts had already been made to kill the king by would-be assassins John Grove and Thomas Pickering, whose silver bullets were continually foiled by poor guns and failing flints. Large sums of money were also to be made available for the scheme. He also had tales of potential Scottish, English, and Irish rebellions, and a Europe-wide conspiracy guaranteed to alarm any rabid anti-Catholic. He backed up his accusations with much, apparently concrete, detail about the secret comings and goings of both himself and his Catholic friends. Oates was also to claim that he had seen numerous letters detailing the plot and yet, as the duke of York later pointed out, he &#145;kept not so much as one for a proof&#146;  (Clarke, 1.522). Most of Oates's revelations stemmed from either his vivid imagination, with a distinct twist of bitterness against his former Catholic friends, or from the previously published accounts of real or imagined plots from the 1660s with their tales of gathering rebel armies, secret commissions, and planned assassinations. By far the most significant aspect of the revelations was Oates's tale of a secret conclave of the Jesuits held at the White Horse tavern in London on 24 April 1678, at which he claimed to have been present and where matters of treason were discussed.<br>
<br>At Tonge's request Oates gave him a copy of the articles and on 11 August 1678 he also furtively left another copy under the wainscot at the home of Sir Richard Barker, Tonge's former landlord and another rabid anti-papist. At this point Oates may also have attempted to sell his tale to the Jesuits in the hope of making money out of them, but he was rebuffed. Tonge was now anxious to reveal all to Charles II directly and involved his friend Christopher Kirkby, who was acquainted with the king, in the scheme. Kirkby approached Charles in St James's Park on the morning of 13 August 1678 with revelations of a popish plot. Charles promptly passed the information to his first minister, the earl of Danby, who interrogated both Kirkby and Tonge and appears to have guessed immediately that a shrewder mind than either of theirs was responsible for the information. Danby sought to discover this person's name but Tonge, believing that Danby was not taking the plot seriously was reluctant to reveal Oates as his informant. Ever full of &#145;projects and notions&#146; Tonge subsequently attempted to seek other ways of bringing the plot to the notice of the public  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.156). Tonge then unsuccessfully tried to embroil Sir Joseph Williamson in the affair before being advised by some &#145;honourable friends&#146; to bring Oates before the Westminster magistrate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10868/', "Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey")</script> to have his evidence legally sworn  (I. Tonge, &#145;Journal of the plot, 1678&#146;, in Greene, 35). On 6 September 1678 Godfrey reluctantly took the Oates depositions, but seems to have guessed the false nature of the evidence. Then on 28&#150;9 September 1678 first Tonge, and then Oates, came before the privy council for investigation. Oates seized the opportunity to reveal still more of the fabricated plot, having by this time expanded his accusations to eighty-one articles. Despite the presence, and the shrewd questioning, of Charles II, Oates's lies convinced the privy council, especially when he revealed that the duchess of York's secretary Edward Coleman had handled money for the plot and had also been in correspondence with Father la Chaise, Louis XIV's confessor. Oates had, in Coleman, unluckily for the latter, hit upon one of the more likely figures for a serious Catholic plot. In accusing Coleman he may have been prompted by leading questions from Danby, or he may have heard independently something of the secretary's activities, for Coleman was a prominent Catholic eager to see the re-establishment of his church in England. Oates sought to please his audience with ever more audacious revelations, which were also, however, increasingly complex and inconsistent. The duke of York later noted with some dismay that Oates was always allowed the &#145;liberty &hellip; of contradicting at pleasure what he had sworne before&#146;  (Clarke, 1.521), while Sir Henry Coventry, who saw Oates give his evidence, noted that &#145;If he [Oates] be a liar, he is the greatest and adroitest I ever saw, and yet it is a stupendous thing to think what vast concerns are like to depend upon the evidence of one young man who hath twice changed his religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.207). In spite of any doubts the privy council may have had they soon sent Oates speeding &#145;hither and thither, accompanied by soldiers, and enjoying complete power to imprison those he chose &hellip; his greatest pleasure was to be feared by everyone and to harm as many as possible&#146;  (Walner, 1.202). The Jesuit fathers William Ireland and John Fenwick were arrested. Thomas Pickering, a Benedictine lay brother, and John Grove were also caught up in Oates's net. The Jesuit William Harcourt, who was ill, was left in his lodgings with a guard at the door. Oates was given lodgings in Whitehall and an initial pension of &pound;40 per month. The seizure of Coleman's papers appeared to confirm some of Oates's tale and, although he did not even recognize Coleman when he appeared before the council, he grew bolder. Further apparent confirmation of the reality of the plot followed with the mysterious death of Edmund Godfrey in October 1678 and the actions of the House of Commons, when, in the same month, they tried to take over the investigation of the plot and turned it into a real crisis.<h2>
<a name="OatesandthePopishPlottrials"></a>Oates and the Popish Plot trials</h2>Oates was summoned before the House of Commons in October 1678 and subsequently made further appearances. He impressed the house with the apparent solidity of his stories and his confident delivery. A mixture of boldness and bluster he always tried to mix some elements of the truth, however tenuous and convoluted, into his statements and when in doubt would construct yet another lie. With his flexible memory new revelations from Oates could never be ruled out and he increasingly struck out against those who had antagonized him in the past. In case such men were thought too insignificant to organize any plot he also added the names of the so-called five Popish lords as the main conspirators: Bellasis, Petre, Powis, Stafford, and Arundel. As a result he received the thanks of parliament for his pains in discovering the plot. The duke of York noted that Oates &#145;did not positively accuse any Lord, till he had been before the Commons, and that he saw how they relished it; nor did he till then, give them their different implyements, which how fit they were for, all the world might judge&#146;  (Clarke, 1.521). In any event such matters convinced an audience already primed to believe such tales through decades of anti-Catholic propaganda. Serious investigations into the plot soon revealed the obvious contradictions in Oates's tales, and many later commentators challenged Oates to &#145;Tell us how all this heterogeneous Medley can be reconciled to common sense &hellip; all those hidden incongruities, Absurdities, Amusements, and Contradictions, that have composed your Testimony, in which you have over and over again been buffoon'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eikon brotoloigou, or, The Picture of Titus Oates DD Drawn to the Life in a Letter to Himself</span>, 1697, 16). His apparent openness about having been a sinner, moreover, and his claim that he had repented, as well as his continued, though unwarranted, use of clerical dress, gave him dignity. Oates depicted himself as a man who had seen the light and braved many dangers to save the nation. His initial grasp of very complex and detailed evidence was also impressive. Indeed, so complex did the story become that it was soon necessary to print collated versions to give the public at least some understanding of the threats involved.<br>
<br>The arrival of William Bedloe on the scene in November 1678, eager to add his own evidence about the plot, meant that Oates had to adjust his story somewhat, but this rivalry did not prevent him joining Bedloe in an attempt to implicate the queen in the plot that same month. This was going too far for some in the government and for a short while Oates was confined to his lodgings and his papers seized. Oates had a tense relationship with other important informers. Bedloe, for a time, somewhat stole his glory, although Tonge and Kirkby were swiftly ignored, while Miles Prance was merely described as a &#145;blockhead&#146;  (W. Smith, <span class="italic">Contrivances of the fanatical Conspirators in Carrying on their Treasons under the Umbrage of the Popish Plot, Laid Open</span>, 1685, 25). The trial of Edward Coleman on 27 November 1678 saw Oates make his first attempt as a chief witness in a legal setting. This first trial set a precedent for the others in that during the course of the proceedings flimsy evidence was accepted as certain fact. Oates remained vague on the details, and apparently made up his story as he went along, weaving in new material with the old. In the trials of Grove, Pickering, and Ireland on 17 December 1678, Oates's evidence was on more stable ground, as many of those involved could not deny knowing him and printed versions of his story were now available for him to use as a crib.<br>
<br>Although Oates was given helpful judges and many other prompts his perjuries often became obvious in court. Evidence was given to show that he was in St Omer in April 1678 and therefore could not have attended any secret Jesuit consult in London on 24 April, let alone have seen Father Ireland there, as he claimed. Oates often sought refuge in stories of poor light, or his failing eyesight, or his selective memory, thus enabling him to claim blithely that he did not recognize people. If this failed then he turned to headaches and became unwell. The inherent problems with Oates's evidence were ignored by a legal system all too obviously keen to convict these men and they were executed on 3 February 1679. In April 1679 Oates's sixty-eight-page version of the plot was officially published by order of the House of Lords. He appeared as a witness in more trials in June, including that of the Catholic lawyer, Richard Langhorne. All of the accused were convicted and executed. In the trial of the queen's physician, Sir George Wakeman, in July 1679, however, he overreached himself in his evidence and the judge, Lord Chief Justice Scroggs, disparaged him. Both Oates and Bedloe attempted revenge by presenting articles implicating Scroggs in the plot to the privy council in January 1680 but failed utterly when Scroggs ably defended himself. At Viscount Stafford's trial on 30 November in the same year Oates resorted to stating that he needed to give his evidence &#145;to his own method and be uninterrupted&#146;, however, &#145;he spoke positively &hellip; with many shrewd circumstances, nor could any cross-questions discompose him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 5, 1908, 513).<h2>
<a name="Thecollapseoftheplot"></a>The collapse of the plot</h2>Oates at the height of his career had been responsible in one way or another for the deaths of some thirty-five men. By 1681 however the tide had begun to turn against him and he lost several cases of libel against those who attacked his opinions or person. One hostile contemporary gave a description of him at this time suggesting a most repulsive appearance:<blockquote>[his] off leg behind is somewhat shorter than the other &hellip; his face a Rainbow colour, and the rest of his body black: Two slouching ears &hellip; His mouth is in the middle of his face, exactly between the upper part of his forehead and the lower part of his chin; He hath a short neck &hellip; a thin Chin, and somewhat sharp. (<span class="italic">A Hue and Cry</span>)</blockquote>By 1682 Oates's pension had been reduced and he was forced to take refuge in the City. With the plot in collapse by 1683 many of the informers now suffered the consequences of their actions. William Bedloe had died in 1680, as had Israel Tonge, but others were available for punishment. Titus Oates was finally arrested at the Amsterdam coffee house on 10 May 1684 on a charge of <i>scandalum magnatum</i> after a suit by the duke of York, whom Oates had called a traitor. Fined &pound;100,000 after refusing to plead Oates was placed in the Compter in default of payment and was later moved to the king's bench prison. In October and December 1684 he was presented on charges of perjury. The trial was delayed by the death of Charles II on 6 February 1685 but finally took place on 8&#150;9 May 1685. His &#145;behaviour during the trial was very confident: many hott words pass'd between the chief justice [Jeffries] and him&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.342). Oates was convicted on two counts: that he had falsely sworn on 8&#150;12 August 1678 to a &#145;consult&#146; of Jesuits at the White Horse tavern and that he had also falsely sworn to the presence of William Ireland in London on the same dates. A week later he was sentenced. He was to be imprisoned for life, divested of his canonical garb for ever and brought to Westminster Hall with a paper on his head with the inscription: &#145;Titus Oates convicted upon full evidence of two horrid perjuries&#146;  (ibid., 343). He was also placed in the pillory in Palace Yard, Westminster, on 19 May and was roundly pelted with eggs and other rubbish. This part of the sentence was to be repeated five times every year of his life in different parts of London. As part of the first round of his punishment, on 20 May Oates was led at the cart's tail and whipped from Aldgate to Newgate &#145;with hideous bellowings, and [he] swooned several times with the greatness of the anguish&#146;  (L. Echard, <span class="italic">History of England</span>, 3 vols., 3rd edn, 1720, vol. 3, p. 1054). On 22 May he was whipped again from Newgate to Tyburn. Oates later claimed that he had &#145;suffer'd some thousands of stripes&#146;  (W. H. Hart, &#145;Petitions of Dr Titus Oates&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 2, 1856, 282). He had survived this torture only through the care of his surgeon and in spite of further cruelties by his gaolers who, while he was still weak, got into his cell and pulled the bandages from his back. He had also been placed in &#145;the Hole or Dungeon of the sd prison&#146;  (ibid.) loaded down with irons, despite his gout, and had apparently become subject to convulsions. Oates was lodged in the king's bench and remained there for three years. Rumours of his death were given out in 1688, but in fact the revolution of that year temporarily revived his fortunes.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>After the flight of James II and the revolution Oates was released from prison in December 1688. He then sought succour from several &#145;Noblemen and Gentlemen, Citizens and others &hellip; for his support and maintenance&#146;  (W. H. Hart, &#145;Petitions of Dr Titus Oates&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 2, 1856, 282). He also sought reinstatement as the idol of the public and saviour of the nation. He stated his grievances in various petitions to the House of Lords but, impatient at delays, he also petitioned the Commons. He then fell foul of the House of Lords for breach of privilege and was soon back in gaol. On 30 May 1689 he once more came before the Lords but refused, out of conscience he said, to give up his claim to hold the degree of doctor of divinity from Salamanca and was sent back to the king's bench prison. His case made little progress, becoming caught up in the post-revolution rivalry between the houses. His obstreperous and unpleasant character also hindered his cause, and when eventually released in August 1689 he remained a convicted perjurer. Despite this William III ordered &pound;40 a month to be paid to Oates out of secret service funds, which sum Oates was said to have thought rather mean spirited. This pension lasted from 1689 to 1692 and was then retrenched.<br>
<br>In these later years Oates moved into a house in Axe Yard, Westminster, and sought to promote himself mainly through writing pamphlets retelling the story of the plot. He took care to condemn both Charles II, now safely dead, as a papist, and James II. He also stressed his own courage as a martyr in the face of adversity. His new bogey was a Franco-Jacobite plot and he took to associating with whigs such as Aaron Smith, John Arnold, John Tutchin, and also the former government agent, William Fuller. Fuller, no novice at spying, lodged with Oates and under his tutelage claimed knowledge of a Jacobite plot, but was later discredited. Oates seems to have acted as mentor to a number of zealous anti-Catholic individuals who frequently met at his house.<br>
<br>As a result of his involvement with Fuller, and his furious anti-Jacobite writings, Oates's pension was cut and to save his finances he married Rebecca (<i>b</i>. 1669/70, <i>d</i>. in or after 1705), daughter of John Weld, a wealthy London draper, on 17 August 1693 at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, amid much satirical comment and in spite of the strong rumours that Oates was homosexual. One of the milder satires against him claimed that he married only because he had been &#145;touched in [his] conscience for some juvenile gambols that shall be nameless &hellip; and made a vow to sow his wild oats, and not hide the talent which God had plentifully given him in an Italian napkin&#146;  (Brown, 2&#150;3). Rebecca was a &#145;young gentlewoman in the citty, worth 2000 <i>l</i>&#146;  (Luttrell, 3.165). The couple had one child, baptized Rebecca on 3 October 1700. According to rumour Oates also had an illegitimate son by another woman in the king's bench prison in 1688.<br>
<br>Although in September 1693 Oates's new wife was received at court and kissed the queen's hand, he allegedly ran through his wife's fortune in less than six months and in May 1694 claimed that he had few clothes left to wear and &#145;not one shilling to buy my poor wife and family bread. I am in debt 508 <i>l</i>, and must the latter end of this month go to prison and there starve&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 1.661). He received a gift of &pound;100 in July 1694, but by December 1697 he was once more claiming poverty and that &#145;He had a poor aged mother to maintain, and his wife and family will be turn'd out of doors, and [he would] perish in Prison&#146;  (W. H. Hart, &#145;Petitions of Dr Titus Oates&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 2, 1856, 282). He asked for a payment of his arrears and received a restoration of his pension to &pound;300 per annum and &pound;1000 to pay his debts.<br>
<br>In June 1696 Oates had decided to alter his religion once more and return to the Baptist church of his father. Lengthy negotiations with elders of the congregation which met in Virginia Street finally led to his admission into the church in summer 1698, with the generous concession that he could continue to wear his Church of England clerical robes. He took to preaching before his brethren and, with his morbid tales of Catholic abominations, proved popular. Unfortunately he fell out with the congregation in October 1699 over arrangements for the funeral of Hester Parker, a rich widow. Mrs Parker had heartily disliked Oates and consequently he was not invited to the funeral nor asked to preach the funeral sermon. On the day of the sermon, however, Oates prevented it from taking place by suddenly occupying the pulpit and preaching on an entirely unrelated topic, while the congregation's bewilderment turned to anger. This farcical situation, so typical of Oates, was compounded when he encouraged Mrs Parker's husband to contest her will, which had left most of her estate to two members of the congregation. Eventually he caused so much trouble that he was expelled from the sect in November 1701. Trouble continued to dog Oates's later career. In June 1702, while visiting the court of requests, he was confronted by the printer Eleanor James, who had been affronted at hearing him criticize the Church of England, and making &#145;scandalous and reflecting Expressions&#146; about Charles II and God, while wearing his usual canonical robes  (&#145;An account of the proceedings against Dr Titus Oates&#146;, <span class="italic">Scarce and Valuable Tracts &hellip; Lord Somers</span>, 4.420&#150;22). Oates, whose violence was never far below the surface, lost his temper and struck her with his cane. He was indicted at the Westminster quarter sessions on 2 July 1702. Claiming poverty he was fined 6 marks and dismissed, but &#145;not without a severe check for acting so irreverently and unbecoming his profession&#146;  (ibid.). After this incident little is known about Oates's final years. He appears to have died in obscurity, largely unnoticed by most commentators, at Axe Yard on 13 July 1705. His widow was granted administration of his estate on 16 August 1705.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Oates remains an unusual figure in British history and there are a number of explanations for both his personality and career. Early writers were repelled as much by his homosexuality as by his personality. Moreover, his unusual appearance and his abrasive manner meant that he could scarcely be ignored. With his limp, red face, bull neck, nasal drawl, and harsh and brassy voice he proved a raucous and difficult personality. Roger North noted that Oates's &#145;common conversation was larded with lewd oaths, Blasphemy, saucy atheistical, and in every way offensive discourse&#146;  (R. North, <span class="italic">Examen, or, An Enquiry into the Credit and Merits of Pretended Complete History</span>, 1740, 224). Oates's actions have usually been explained as a psychotic's revenge but, given the hostility and rejection which he encountered almost constantly, could equally well be seen as, in part at least, a desire for acceptance and respectability. Oates remained a fantasist: a man who saw himself in the role of the saviour of the nation, fighting demon popes and Jesuits. In his writings he often depicted himself as a man of action, daring to say or do what others would not. He was the secret hero who, despite his outward appearance, managed to infiltrate a most dangerous conspiracy. For a time Oates succeeded beyond his dreams and was genuinely honoured as the saviour of the nation, but the sordid reality of his life in which there were no great secrets to uncover, only back alley meetings, stealing, begging, and poverty, vice, fear, and hatred, and above all failure, soon caught up with him.<br>
