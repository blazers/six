<span class="headword">Dolling,  Robert William Radclyffe</span>  (1851&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and social reformer</span>, was born on 10 February 1851 in the old rectory, Magheralin, co. Down, the sixth of nine children and the elder son of Robert Holbeach Dolling (<i>d</i>. 1878), a landlord in co. Down, and one time high sheriff of Londonderry, and his wife, Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1870), third daughter of Josias Du Pr&eacute; Alexander MP, a nephew of James Alexander, first earl of Caledon. Dolling's childhood was spent at Kilrea, in co. Londonderry. After education at a private school, The Grange, Stevenage, Hertfordshire (1861&#150;4), and at Harrow School (1864&#150;8), he matriculated in 1868 from Trinity College, Cambridge. Bad health and ophthalmia compelled his withdrawal in spring 1869, and he spent the next twelve months in foreign travel, mostly in Italy, including Florence. After his mother's death in 1870 he returned to Ireland, where he assisted his father in land agency work. His spare time in Kilrea was devoted to <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes and night schools for young men, and clubs for working men, and he continued this work in Dublin, where his family soon moved. After his father's death on 28 September 1878 he went to England and made London his permanent home: there he became intimate friends with Arthur Henry Stanton (1839&#150;1913) and Alexander Heriot Mackonochie (1825&#150;1887), two Anglo-Catholic clergymen whom he had met earlier at Cambridge. These two clerics were at that time engaged in stubbornly defending the ritualistic services which they were conducting at St Alban the Martyr, Holborn. Under their influence Dolling became warden of the south London branch of the St Martin's Postman's League in 1879. But Brother Bob, as he was called by the postmen, found more satisfying work among the poorest classes in Southwark, where he exercised a magnetic influence.<br>
<br>Early in 1882 Dolling entered Salisbury Theological College, where his anti-intellectual temperament and belief in practical Christianity came into conflict with student life and theological education. Ordained as a deacon on 20 May 1883 in Salisbury Cathedral by Bishop Robert Campbell Moberly, Dolling became curate of Corscombe, Dorset, and then missionary deacon of St Martin's Mission at Holy Trinity, Stepney. He was ordained as a priest by the bishop of London, Frederick Temple, on Trinity Sunday 1885 at St Paul's Cathedral. Failing health and difficulties on questions of ritual with Bishop Temple led to Dolling's retirement from Stepney on 1 July 1885. After a short stay at St Leonards, in the same year Dolling became vicar of the Winchester College Mission of St Agatha's, Landport, Portsmouth, where for ten years he did much to mitigate the social problems of slum life, especially prostitution, poverty, and drunkenness. He also supported the campaign for shorter working hours and better wages, and believed that it was &#145;not far distant when employers will find that the men's Unions are really a great gain in the solution of the whole Labour Question&#146;  (Dolling, 130). He was also involved in frequent controversy over liturgical practices.<br>
<br>Dolling believed that the colour and spectacle of ritualism drew people to religion, a belief possibly not unconnected to his own enthusiasm for the theatre, which he attended frequently. Certainly, in conjunction with his strong personality and energetic evangelistic zeal, it attracted a large congregation to his church and contributed to his strong local influence, which was greatest over women and young people. His endorsement of confession, incense, extra-liturgical practices, and a small booklet, <span class="italic">St Agatha's, Landport, Sunday Scholars' Book</span> (1890s?), which critics thought deviated from Anglican teaching on the eucharist, brought him into conflict with his bishops. Fresh disagreements with the newly appointed bishop of Winchester, Randall Davidson, caused Dolling's resignation of his living on 8 December 1895. St Agatha's Church had been rebuilt, and Davidson refused to grant a licence for it, as it contained an altar which would be used exclusively for requiem masses. Dolling, who had already decided to leave St Agatha's, would not compromise, and this affair provided him with a dramatic excuse. After he left Landport he wrote <span class="italic">Ten Years in a Portsmouth Slum</span> (1896), which gave a full account of his work and experiences at St Agatha's and his problems with Davidson.<br>
<br>During 1896&#150;7 Dolling stayed in London with his sister Josephine at Earls Court, giving occasional addresses in various parts of England. In May 1897 he went to America, where he preached in numerous cities. At Chicago in March 1898 he was offered the deanery of the cathedral by Bishop William Edward McLaren, but he had already accepted the living of St Saviour's, Poplar, and returned to England in July 1898. At Poplar he again sought to solve the social and municipal problems of the district; the east London water famine of 1898, the evils of overcrowding, and the smallpox epidemic of 1901 roused all his energies, and he fiercely denounced those responsible for these scandals. In March 1901 Dolling's health failed, and after travelling abroad in hope of relief he died, unmarried, on 15 May 1902, at his sister's house in South Kensington. Solemn requiem masses were said at St Cuthbert's, Philbeach Gardens, and at St Saviour's, and he was buried next to A. H. Mackonochie at Woking on 21 May. In June 1902 a government annuity was purchased in his memory for his two sisters Elise and Geraldine, who had helped him in his work; the Dolling memorial home of rest for the working girls of Poplar and Landport was opened at Worthing under their management in 1903.<br>
<br>The missionary enthusiasm of Father Dolling, as he was widely known, combined an almost evangelical fervour with a strong commitment to ritualist practices and pragmatic philanthropy. Impatient of ecclesiastical authority, he was an unconventional and essentially emotional preacher who appealed potently to marginal social groups. His commitment to the disadvantaged and dispossessed was evident in his radical politics: he strongly advocated Irish home rule, church disestablishment, and the labour movement. A stout man with a generous personality, he earned an unexpected tribute at his death from the nonconformist paper <span class="italic">British Weekly</span> (22 May 1902), which commented aptly that he had &#145;lived and died in slum parishes, with outcasts sleeping under his roof, with vagabonds dining at his table&#146;.<br>
