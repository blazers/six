<span class="headword">Stedman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Adams]</span>,  Phyllis</span>, Baroness Stedman  (1916&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 49 St Paul's Road, Peterborough, on 14 July 1916, the daughter of Percy Adams (1893&#150;1977), an iron moulder in a firm of naval engineers, and his wife, Emmie <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke. She was educated at Lincoln Road junior school and Peterborough county grammar school, where she became head girl and excelled at oratory and debate. Her neighbourhood and family were steeped in socialism, and in 1929 she joined her first political campaign, having been introduced to politics by her trade unionist father who was a Labour/Co-operative county councillor. After leaving school she worked as a librarian for Peterborough city council from 1932 until 1941, when she went to Derbyshire with the national fire service as part of the war effort. As a group officer until 1944 she was responsible for almost one thousand full- and part-time firefighters and made lifelong friends.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1941, at Park Road Baptist Church, Peterborough, she married Henry William (Harry) Stedman (1910&#150;1988), who was also serving as an auxiliary fireman; he was the son of Edmund Walter Stedman, nurseryman. They had met three years earlier on an election campaign for Stedman's father. The couple, who had no children, shared their political and gardening careers: after the war, they restored the Stedman family's horticultural and landscaping business, which her husband owned until 1963; he exhibited regularly at the Chelsea flower show.<br>
<br>In 1946 Stedman followed her husband onto the soke of Peterborough (the county council), winning by ten votes. She spent the next thirty years on the soke and its successor bodies (Huntingdon and Peterborough from 1965, and Cambridgeshire from 1974). In the early 1970s she chaired Huntingdon and Peterborough council's fire service committee and was vice-chairman of Cambridgeshire council, but was better at political campaigning than administration or developing policy ideas. With a keen sense of humour and a warm-hearted, genial nature, she was popular with both parties, but she defended tenaciously what she felt was right. While not ideological, she disliked compromise. As election agent for Peterborough at the general election of 1966, she requested a record seven recounts before the Labour candidate lost by three votes. (In 1951 she had been Labour's parliamentary candidate for Hampstead but withdrew due to illness.)<br>
<br>Deeply devoted to her home town, Stedman served on the Peterborough New Town Development Corporation from 1972&#151;four years after Peterborough had been designated one of the last four new towns&#151;to 1975. Her awareness of local people and their interests helped the corporation to gauge local sensitivities. Another great interest was the disabled, and for twenty-nine years the Stedmans managed and financed the Peterborough branch of PHAB (Physically Handicapped and Able Bodied), which organized activities bringing together young people with and without disabilities; in 1979 she became national vice-chairman.<br>
<br>When the Labour Party returned to power nationally and found itself inadequately represented in the House of Lords, Stedman received a life peerage in June 1974. Appointed a Labour whip in the House of Lords, in 1975, she was an eloquent spokesman on new towns, local government, transport, and the environment. In 1978 she chaired a Lords committee on pop festivals, which decided against introducing licensing; she made some headlines by declaring her preference for the music of Mantovani and George Melachrino. Finally, in January 1979, she became the Department of the Environment's parliamentary under-secretary for sport and water resources, though Labour's election defeat in May ended her ministerial career.<br>
<br>Stedman remained a frontbencher as environmental spokesman (conservation was another of her interests) but questioned Labour's increasingly leftward direction. A former Gaitskellite, she had stopped attending party conferences in disgust at left-wingers' treatment of Hugh Gaitskell in 1960. She joined the new Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981 and became a whip. The SDP appealed particularly to women, and Stedman's lengthy political experience made her an asset to the fledgling party; for a time, however, her Labour former colleagues shunned her. As the SDP's local-government spokesman she successfully amended the 1985 <span class="roman">Local Government Bill</span>&#151;in the face of ministerial opposition&#151;to ensure stronger assurances from the authorities replacing the Greater London council that the greenbelt would be protected.<br>
<br>In 1986 Stedman became the SDP's chief whip and finally party leader in the Lords after the mainly elderly SDP peers rejected the party's merger with the Liberals in 1988. Again, her skill at dealing with people proved useful as for two years she managed a diverse and distinguished group. Once the SDP folded in 1990, the Conservative and Labour whips had to persuade Stedman, who insisted that the seventeen peers were still functioning as a party, to vacate her office suite. Rather than return to Labour, she chose to become a crossbencher. In 1995 she received <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s peer of the year award. Despite reaching the rank of minister and party leader in the Lords, she was essentially a local politician as much as a national one. She died of heart problems at her home, 1 Grovelands, Thorpe Road, Peterborough, on 8 June 1996.<br>
