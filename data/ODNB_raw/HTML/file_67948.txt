<span class="headword">Willaume,  David</span>  (1658&#150;1741), <span class="occ">goldsmith</span>, was born on 7 June 1658 on the Pont des Morts, Metz, France, the third of the six children of Adam Willaume (<i>d</i>. 1704), merchant goldsmith, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Philippe (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1706), who had married on 30 April 1651. Willaume was born into a family of goldsmiths and was probably apprenticed to his father; at least one brother, Adam, was a goldsmith and his three sisters, Marie, Susanne, and Elizabeth, also chose husbands linked to the profession. Willaume became a master goldsmith on 18 April 1680. There is no record of his having registered a hallmark in Metz, nor does his name appear in a list of the city's goldsmiths compiled in 1684, and any intention to work alongside his father would have been dashed by three significant events. The introduction of punitive taxes on the sale of plate in the 1670s was followed by the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685 and two years later by the prohibition of the manufacture of gold items and massive pieces of silver. Such constraints succeeded in emptying Metz, a protestant stronghold, of most of its goldsmiths. With both his religion and profession denied him, Willaume left France.<br>
<br>The date of Willaume's arrival in England is uncertain. Some writers have deemed him to be the refugee Davidi Williamme denizened by act of parliament on 16 December 1687 (though this man arrived with a wife and children whose names do not appear in subsequent records), while others list him as a working goldsmith from 1686. Confirmation of his residence in London comes from the many appearances he makes in the registers of the various Huguenot chapels in London, the first being on 15 August 1688 as godfather to David Surel. These chapels acted as centres of support for the many refugees. Willaume's standing within the French protestant community was assured when on 9 October 1688 he married Marie Mettayer (1666&#150;1710), daughter of Samuel Mettayer, minister of the French chapel of La Patente, Spitalfields, and Susanne Fremin. Marie had two brothers, Samuel and Lewis (the latter subsequently apprenticed to her husband), and two sisters, Ann, who married Simon Gribelin, engraver, and Rachel, who married Jean Rapilliard, also a goldsmith. David and Marie Willaume had four children of whom two survived: Anne born on 14 July 1691 and baptized on the 19th at La Patente in Berwick Street, Soho, who married one of her father's apprentices, David Tanqueray, great-grandfather of Charles Tanqueray (1810&#150;1868), founder of Tanqueray Gin, and subsequently ran her own business until her death in 1733, and <a href="#cosubject_67949">David Willaume the younger [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>By 1691 Willaume, as a purveyor of jewels as well as silver, was flourishing at the sign of the Windsor Castle near Charing Cross. He was emboldened to take his first apprentice, Francis Vaillant, son of the bookseller Paul Vaillant, on 28 June 1693, despite not having been granted his freedom by the Company of Goldsmiths, which he did not gain until 27 September on the instructions of the lord mayor and City of London. His first confirmed hallmark, which harks back to the land of his birth with the inclusion of a fleur de lys, was registered about November 1698 with his address at the sign of the Golden Ball, Pall Mall (next door to Mary Beale, miniaturist). By 1714, while still using the same hallmark and shop sign, he had moved again to premises on the west side of St James's Street, Mayfair, where the business, which by then included banking, remained until 1746. Over a period of thirty years he trained nineteen apprentices, of whom twelve subsequently entered their own hallmark, the most notable being David Tanqueray, Lewis Mettayer, Charles Hatfield, Ayme Vedeau, and William Kidney.<br>
<br>Willaume brought with him grand designs in French fashion, matched by the use of heavy gauge metal and fine casting techniques then greatly to the taste of the English. His acceptance as merchant goldsmith to the nobility was assured and the receipt of royal commissions established him as one of England's leading goldsmiths. Surviving pieces are engraved with armorials that record his eminent clients and patrons, many of whom were closely associated with the protestant cause. The earliest masterpieces are a pair of wine coolers made in 1698 for William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire, one of the &#145;immortal seven&#146; who had invited William of Orange to take the English throne. Although never appointed royal goldsmith (as were two of his apprentices, David Tanqueray and Charles Hatfield), he supplied a magnificent series of ewers and basins to the crown as ambassadorial plate, and to others including the second earl of Jersey and the first earl of Oxford. Other noteworthy objects are a wine fountain and cistern of 1701 made for Chambre Brabazon, fifth earl of Meath (now in the Museum of Fine Art, Boston, Massachusetts), and another of 1707 (Boughton House, Northamptonshire). As well as grand buffet plate his prodigious output included the supply of silver furniture such as the wall sconces of 1699&#151;probably bought in the late eighteenth century from the royal goldsmiths Rundell, Bridge, and Rundell by Lord Brownlow for Belton House, Lincolnshire&#151;and items of pure display, including a pair of silver-gilt mounted carved ivory vases whose ownership before their appearance in the collection of William Beckford has not been traced, part of a set of six finely engraved covered cups and saucers of 1700, and an unusual group of items incorporating panels carved in Chinese taste made over a period of some fifteen years at the outset of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Willaume's acceptance into the English establishment was confirmed on 11 October 1698 with his promotion to the livery of the Goldsmiths' Company, followed by that to the company's court of assistants in 1725, and the offices of touch warden in 1728 and third warden in 1735. This last accolade he declined on the grounds of age and infirmity. The date of his death is unknown but he was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Tingrith, Bedfordshire, on 27 April 1741. In his will, proved on 22 January 1742, he left &pound;105 to be divided between his daughter, son-in-law, and the poor of St Martin-in-the-Fields, with all the unquantified goods and chattels and remainder of the estate passing to his son. While he is known to have received an inheritance from France, there is no doubt that in England he had prospered exceedingly; on the occasion of his daughter's marriage in 1717 he had made a settlement of &pound;4000.<br>
<br>The younger <a name="cosubject_67949"></a><span class="headword">David Willaume</span>  (1693&#150;1761)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 5 March 1693 and apprenticed to his father at the age of fourteen, but did not take up his freedom by patrimony for a further sixteen years. On 17 April 1721 he married Marianna, daughter of Samuel le Febvre, a refugee merchant from Haarlem, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crommelin. Following in his father's footsteps, he was promoted to the livery of the Goldsmiths' Company on 8 March 1727 and about 1728 took over the family business, when he entered his own hallmarks.<br>
<br>In 1730, as a man of significant wealth, he purchased Tingrith, Bedfordshire, a 750 acre manor and mansion house, from Sir Pynsent Chernocke, election agent to another of his clients, the duke of Bedford. By now a widower, in 1733 Willaume married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1708), daughter of Charles Dymoke of Ampthill, Bedfordshire, attorney. They had six children, the first-born, David, dying in infancy. Willaume's involvement in the affairs of the county grew with his appointment as high sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1737&#150;8. His direct connection with the business lessened, and at the time of his last hallmark, entered in 1739 on his behalf by Edward Jordens, he described himself as a &#145;gent of Tingrith&#146;. He took seven apprentices during his career of whom two, William Cripps and Thomas Pitts, became successful goldsmiths. Pitts, the Willaumes' last apprentice, gained his freedom in 1744 while the running of the business itself passed into the hands of Cripps in midsummer 1746. Both Willaume and his second wife were buried at Tingrith, she on 20 June 1746 and he on 26 January 1761. His will was proved on 21 February following. He was survived by four of his six children, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1735), Edward (<i>bap</i>. 1736), Charles Dymoke (<i>bap</i>. 1739), and John Williams (<i>bap</i>. 1741). Tingrith remained in the family's possession, augmented by additional purchases of land by Willaume's eldest son, Edward, in 1767, until sold by his youngest son, John Williams Willaume, in 1810.<br>
<br>The 1720s, the years when both David Willaumes worked together, saw them produce the remarkable silver-gilt toilet service (Ulster Museum) given by Robert Fitzgerald, nineteenth earl of Kildare, to his wife to celebrate the birth of a son. Although not as dynamic as his father, with fewer major commissions, the younger Willaume none the less enjoyed wide-ranging patronage, and noted extant items were made for the Tollemache family, particularly Lionel, fourth earl of Dysart, and also George Booth, second earl of Warrington, much of whose remarkable plate is still held at Dunham Massey, Cheshire.<br>
