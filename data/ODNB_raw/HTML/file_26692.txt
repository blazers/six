<span class="headword">Stuart, Sir  Alexander <span class="st"> [Alick]</span></span>  (1824&#150;1886), <span class="occ">merchant and politician in Australia</span>, was born on 21 March 1824 in Edinburgh, one of the nine children of Alexander Stuart, writer to the signet, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKnight. Alick, as he was known, was educated at Edinburgh Academy (1832&#150;5) and at the city's university (1837). Having embarked on a commercial career, he went into a merchant's office in Glasgow, then to Belfast as manager of the North of Ireland Linen Mills, and in 1845 joined Carr Tagore &amp; Co. in Calcutta, India. Finding the climate there debilitating, he moved to New Zealand in 1850, visited New South Wales, and spent some time on the Victorian goldfields. He eventually settled in Sydney, where he became assistant secretary to the Bank of New South Wales in December 1852; in 1854 he was made secretary and inspector. On 10 November 1853, at Narellan, he married Christiana Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1889), the daughter of John Wood RN.<br>
<br>Stuart's abilities attracted the notice of the head of the firm of Robert Towns &amp; Co., which he joined in 1855 as a partner (senior partner from 1873), and he soon became prominent in commercial circles. He was a director of the Bank of New South Wales (for seventeen years between 1855 and 1879) and of a number of insurance and mining companies, and a committee member of the Sydney chamber of commerce; he invested heavily in Queensland pastoral stations.<br>
<br>Although he had been brought up as a member of the Episcopal Church of Scotland, in Sydney Stuart served on the diocesan, provincial, and general synods of the Church of England, sat on the cathedral chapter, and was a trustee of church lands. In the 1870s he championed the retention of state aid to denominational schools and helped to form the Church of England Defence Association. Having been asked by Bishop Frederick Barker to stand for parliament, in December 1874 he entered the legislative assembly for East Sydney. A free-trader, he was slow to action, but dogged, and proved an effective debater. From 8 February 1876 until the ministry fell on 21 March 1877 he was treasurer in the cabinet of Sir John Robertson. He was re-elected for East Sydney, but resigned in March 1879, when he was appointed agent-general for the colony in London. Unable to unravel his own and Towns &amp; Co.'s financial difficulties, he did not take up the post. Having managed to avoid bankruptcy (partly through the Coal Cliff Coal Company), at the general election of 1880 he was returned for Illawarra. In 1882 he became leader of the opposition, defeating the Parkes&#150;Robertson ministry on the <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> of 1882. The government lost at the polls, and on 5 January 1883 Stuart became premier. He at once appointed a commission of inquiry into the land laws, and in October brought in a land bill to control the indiscriminate selection and sale of crown land, to give some security of tenure to squatters, and to establish local land boards and courts. This was discussed with heat and acrimony during the record thirteen-month session and eventually passed into law in October 1884. Stuart had established the Aborigines protection board in 1883 and carried an act (1883) to regulate the civil service. He supported the annexation of eastern New Guinea by Queensland in 1884 and presided over the intercolonial convention which established the ineffective federal council of Australasia.<br>
<br>Unable to delegate and &#145;imprudently industrious&#146;, Stuart had a sudden stroke early in 1885; after holidaying in New Zealand he resumed office in May and was made KCMG in June, but he was so enfeebled that on 6 October 1885 he retired. He was nominated to the legislative council, and later in the year went to London as executive commissioner for the colony for the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886; but he died of typhoid fever on 16 June 1886 at 52 Stanhope Gardens, Kensington, after the opening of the exhibition. His wife, son, and a daughter survived him. He was buried at Christ Church, Roxeth, near Harrow.<br>
