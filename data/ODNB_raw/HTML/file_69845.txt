<span class="headword">Plunket <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Guinness]</span>,  Aileen Sibell Mary</span>  (1904&#150;1999), <span class="occ">society hostess</span>, was the eldest of the three daughters of Arthur Ernest Guinness (1876&#150;1949), second son of the first earl of Iveagh, and his wife, Marie Clothilde Russell (1880&#150;1953), daughter of Sir George Russell, fourth baronet, of Swallowfield. She was born on 16 May 1904, and was followed into the world by her sisters <a name="cosubject_69845"></a><span class="headword">Maureen Constance Guinness</span>  (1907&#150;1998)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 31 January 1907, and <a name="cosubject_76265"></a><span class="headword">Oonagh Guinness</span>  (1910&#150;1995)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 22 February 1910. The three Guinness sisters were to be celebrated as the Golden Guinness Girls of 1920s fashionable society. Their upbringing was both very luxurious and, according to Maureen in later life, loveless. Ernest Guinness took the family brewing business under his wing. His private passions&#151;the brewery, yachting, and every kind of technical innovation&#151;completely dominated his life. A martinet who insisted that the domestic routine ran with calculated precision, he gave his daughters every advantage that money and position could buy (including in 1923 a world cruise in his state-of-the-art yacht <i>Fant&ocirc;me II</i>), but little understanding. After &#145;coming out&#146; in the mid-1920s, they took London by storm. They were as gay and beautiful as they were wealthy, and titled young men fell over themselves to win their favours. &#145;They are all transparent-skinned, with pale hair and light blue eyes. You can very nearly see through them&#146;, wrote film director John Huston  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 April 1999). With figures in the style of the duchess of Windsor, they made throughout their lives striking fashion statements, and were great favourites with gossip columnists and society photographers; in later life Maureen had a penchant for diamant&eacute;-encrusted, horn-rimmed spectacles. They enjoyed an inexhaustible flow of money and relished to the utmost the irresponsible lifestyle espoused by the fashionable &eacute;lite. When the golden age came to an end, the golden girls, like brilliant parakeets in a coal shed, found it impossible to adapt to a world that had become drab and serious.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1927 Aileen became the wife of Brinsley Sheridan Bushe Plunket (1903&#150;1941), second son of the fifth Baron Plunket, and bought the 570 acre Luttrellstown Castle estate near Dublin and made it the setting for lavish and unusual parties. She redesigned several of the rooms and filled them with exquisite furniture, paintings, and <i>objets d'art</i>, including a collection of frogs modelled in different materials. Always under pressure to be an innovative hostess, Aileen diverted her guests with fancy-dress parties, drag parties, disguise parties, and parties at which everyone ate off the floor. Having had three daughters, one of whom died as a child in 1936, her marriage was dissolved in 1940, a few months before Plunket was killed on active service.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1956 Aileen married Valerian Stux-Rybar (1918/19&#150;1990), a Yugoslav-born American interior designer patronized by the great and famous. With her new man beside her, she set about trying to re-create the thirties. The swinging sixties ushered in a brief revival of lavish partying and Aileen enjoyed welcoming old friends like the duchess of Windsor and members of the younger jet set to Luttrellstown, but also hosted events for the Irish government. But when her father died in 1949 his estate was heavily encumbered with death duties. In 1965 Aileen disembarrassed herself of Stux-Rybar, whom she had discovered to be an extravagance even she could not afford, and resumed her first husband's name. As the years passed, Aileen frequently complained of poverty. Undoubtedly she was no longer able to spend with her accustomed freedom, but that did not prevent her from popping over to Paris to visit her hairdresser or blowing in Bond Street any cash that came to hand. The end of an era arrived in 1983 with the mammoth sale of Luttrellstown Castle and its contents. Thereafter Aileen lived comparatively modestly in London and at Elsenham, near Bishop's Stortford, until her death on 31 March 1999.<br>
<br>Maureen Guinness, the next sister, was a feisty young woman with a wicked sense of humour, pursued in the thirties by men as different as Oswald Mosley and Augustus John. She made, on 3 July 1930, a successful marriage to her cousin, Basil Sheridan Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1909&#150;1945), who weeks afterwards became fourth marquess of Dufferin and Ava. They had a son and two daughters. He possessed intellect as well as charm and pursued a promising political career, becoming the government whip in the Lords and parliamentary under-secretary for the colonies. His work and her socializing kept them much in London, but Maureen had become chatelaine of the Dufferins' mansion, Clandeboye, a beautiful but much run-down 3000 acre estate in co. Down. Rescued with Maureen's money, it became yet another venue for lavish entertaining <i>&agrave; la</i> Guinness. Here were played several of the pranks for which Maureen became famous, such as disguising herself as a slovenly maid and being insolent to her guests. The idyll came to an end on 25 March 1945 when Basil, on wartime service in Burma, was killed in a Japanese ambush.<br>
<br>Lady Dufferin failed to find happiness in a brief marriage to (Harry Alexander) Desmond Buchanan (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), a military officer thirteen years her junior, whom she married on 14 September 1948 and divorced in 1954, and she married again, on 20 August 1955; her third husband was Judge John Cyril Maude (1901&#150;1986). In 1968 she handed Clandeboye over to her son but she still delighted in giving parties, her most celebrated being the annual dinners she held for the queen mother. She succeeded her father on the board of Guinness. Sorrows abounded in her later years, most of them caused by her turbulent relationships with her children. Sheridan's high-profile marriage to Lindy Guinness, of the family's banking branch, foundered on his homosexuality. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60645/', "Lady Caroline Blackwood")</script>, author, infuriated her mother by her brief and torrid marriage to the artist Lucian Freud. In the mid-1990s Caroline and Perdita, with Sheridan's widow, unsuccessfully contested in the High Court Maureen's decision to bypass them in favour of her granddaughters. These sad events took place against the background of the family's loss of control of the brewery. As Maureen wearily observed near the end of her life, &#145;The only problem the Guinnesses don't have is money&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 May 1998).<br>
<br>Maureen Dufferin (she retained her first husband's name and title) was the inspiration for Osbert Lancaster's cartoon character Maudie, countess of Littlehampton, while the female impersonator Barrie Humphries seems to have drawn on her for the appearance, if not the character, of Dame Edna Everidge. She died in London on 3 May 1998.<br>
<br>Oonagh Guinness, fey and intense, had a passion for artists, writers, and children, with all of whom she surrounded herself. She collected creative people and entertained them lavishly at Luggala, a fairy-tale palace buried in the Wicklow Mountains, a wedding present from her father. Her first marriage, to financier Philip Leyland Kindersley (1907&#150;1995), lasted from 24 June 1929 to 1936 and produced two children: Tessa, who died at the age of fourteen, and Gay Kindersley (1930&#150;2011), who became a leading National Hunt jockey and a Jockey Club steward. After her first divorce Oonagh immediately married (on 29 April 1936) Dominick Geoffrey Edward Browne, fourth Baron Oranmore and Browne (1901&#150;2002); this union lasted for fourteen years, producing three sons, one of whom died in infancy. Finally, between 1957 and 1965 she was married to New York dress designer Miguel Ferreras. In the 1950s and 1960s Oonagh Browne (she resumed the name after her third divorce) partied frenziedly with the international avant-garde, pausing only to rebuild Luggala completely after a disastrous fire in 1956.<br>
<br>Tragedy dogged Oonagh's family relationships. She lost two children before adulthood. Her third surviving son, Tara Browne, one of the darlings of the sixties jet set and a friend of The Beatles, married a woman of whom Oonagh disapproved and she did all in her power to come between them. Tara was killed in 1966 when he crashed his sports car, and Oonagh then obtained custody of her grandchildren, moving to France to bring them up with Mexican twins she had recently adopted. She subsequently returned to Luggala and died there on 2 August 1995.<br>
<br>The Golden Guinness Girls epitomized a moment in the 1920s when to be young, rich, and beautiful brought celebrity, a stark contrast to the horrors of the preceding decade and the austerities to come. Archetypal &#145;bright young things&#146;, their glamour enlivened Anglo-Irish society; their parties&#151;and their stamina&#151;were legendary. No longer young, they found themselves at home in the swinging sixties, although the figures they now cut were ripe for satire. Their good humour and charm in society did not translate into domestic felicity, and their passing marked the end of an era.<br>
