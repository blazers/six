<span class="headword">Smith,  George William Duff  Assheton</span>  (1848&#150;1904), <span class="occ">quarry owner and landowner</span>, was born on 17 May 1848 in London, the eldest son of Robert George Duff (<i>b</i>. 1819), of Wellington Lodge, Isle of Wight, and Mary Astley (<i>d</i>. 1874). He had two brothers, Charles Garden Duff (1851&#150;1914) and Henry Assheton Duff (<i>b</i>. 1862), and a sister, Louisa Alice. He assumed the surname Assheton Smith (or Assheton-Smith) in 1859, when the Vaynol estate near Bangor in Caernarvonshire, including Dinorwig quarry, was bequeathed to him for his lifetime under the will of Matilda, widow of his great-uncle, Thomas Assheton Smith (1776&#150;1858). He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1888 he married Laura Alice Stanhope Jones, daughter of Colin Stanhope Jones; they had one child, Enid.<br>
<br>Assheton Smith, who had a moustache and a serious countenance, inherited 36,000 acres of land with an annual rental income of &pound;25,000. In his evidence to the royal commission on land in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1893, the agent Captain N. P. Stewart said that there were about 1600 farm tenants and cottagers on the estate and that about 100 cottages had been built in the previous fifteen years. Many quarrymen lived close to the quarry in Llanberis, but accommodation there was scarce and some of the men lodged in the quarry barracks, returning to homes in Anglesey at weekends. Before the introduction of a workers' train in 1895, many of the men travelled on velocipedes, open vehicles operated by foot or hand along the railway.<br>
<br>Assheton Smith, the squire of Vaynol, took an interest in the improvement of the estate and rarely visited London. He was an animal lover, a keen horseman, and a race-horse owner. He had a menagerie of wild animals in Vaynol Park, but this was given up before his death. His yacht, the <i>Pandora</i>, was used for fishing expeditions. He was high sheriff of Anglesey in 1872 and of Caernarvonshire in 1878, and was also a JP and the deputy lieutenant for Caernarvonshire. He supported a branch of the Primrose League in Caernarfon. As one of the wealthiest and largest property owners in Wales, he was an influential figure. The main source of his wealth was Dinorwig quarry, which dated from 1787 and was carved out of the south side of Elidir mountain at Llanberis.<br>
<br>Dinorwig quarry consisted of the early workings, including Allt Ddu, and the main quarry. Tramways ran along open galleries, which were at vertical intervals of about 75 ft, and there were two principal incline systems. Transport was by the Padarn Railway which superseded the Dinorwig tramway in 1843 and was converted to steam in 1848. Its 7 mile track ran from Gilfach-ddu, where in 1870 large workshops were sited, to Y Felinheli (&#145;Port Dinorwic&#146;) on the Menai Strait. This harbour, half way between Bangor and Caernarfon, had a large basin and a dry dock where ship repairs were carried out. In 1852 a private branch connected Y Felinheli via the Bangor&#150;Caernarfon Railway to the main-line system, but in 1882 most of the 90,000 tons of slate produced by the 2700 men at Dinorwig was being sent by sea, and in the 1890s the quarry had its own fleet of four steel-hulled screw-steamers.<br>
<br>When Assheton Smith took over the quarry in 1869, his quarrymen told him they would be &#145;quiet, honest and obedient&#146;, but in June 1874 all but eleven of them refused to give up membership of the newly created North Wales Quarrymen's Union (NWQU) and 2200 men were locked out for five weeks. Unwilling to lose profits in a buoyant slate market, Assheton Smith accepted trade unionism so long as it did not interfere with the rights of management. However, a depression in the slate industry led to wage cuts and a smaller workforce. The men resented the stricter discipline imposed by the new chief manager, Colonel James Wyatt, and in 1880 Assheton Smith put pressure on them to contract out of the <span class="roman">Employers' Liability Act</span>. After Wyatt's death in 1884, his successor, the Hon. W. W. Vivian, joined with the works manager John Davies in implementing new rules, which the quarrymen saw as an infringement of their liberty. In July and October 1885 groups of men were suspended for leaving early, and a mass meeting held in working hours resulted in a lock-out from 31 October.<br>
<br>When the quarry was reopened on 15 December, the men marched to the quarry and ordered the managers to leave for their own safety. The strikers resisted an appeal from W. J. Parry, the president of the NWQU, to abandon their rebellious attitude, but the exhaustion of their funds and an intervention by John Robinson of Tal-y-sarn quarry in Nantlle led to their surrender in February 1886. The disputed rules remained in force, and 300 men were dismissed. During the dispute Assheton Smith was much criticized by the Welsh radical press, and he incurred further hostility when at Caernarfon assizes in January 1886 he was found guilty of negligence for having accidentally shot and injured N. D. Lambert, a forester, who was acting as a game-beater for a shooting party. The jury rejected the victim's claim for &pound;400 compensation and declared the &pound;30 Assheton Smith had offered to be adequate.<br>
<br>The end of the dispute led to some improvement in labour relations at Dinorwig quarry. In June 1887 Assheton Smith paid the men's fares to London for the jubilee, and on his marriage in June 1888 he remitted six months of his tenants' rent and paid the fares and expenses of a day trip to Liverpool or Manchester for all his employees. Wages were raised by 5 per cent in 1895. Assheton Smith offered an interest-free loan to his friend Lord Penrhyn, in July 1897, to help him in the Penrhyn quarry dispute, but the offer was declined. In December 1901 Vivian retired and was succeeded by E. Neele. In May 1902 the prince of Wales stayed at Vaynol for his installation in Caernarfon as chancellor of the University of Wales, and the quarrymen were given a day's holiday plus payments of 6<i>s</i>. to those over twenty and 4<i>s</i>. to those under.<br>
<br>Assheton Smith died of heart disease at Vaynol on 22 November 1904 and was buried in the mausoleum in Vaynol Park. He was survived by his wife. The estate passed to his brother Charles Garden Duff, who assumed the surname Assheton Smith.<br>
