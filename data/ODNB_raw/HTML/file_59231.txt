<span class="headword">Welin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hedenstr&ouml;m]</span>,  Agnes Carolina Albertina</span>  (1844&#150;1928), <span class="occ">missionary to seafarers</span>, was born on 15 March 1844 in H&auml;rad, S&ouml;dermanland, south-west of Stockholm, Sweden. Her strong, Slavic features reflected her partly Russian paternal ancestry. Her father, Claes August Hedenstr&ouml;m, a gamekeeper, died when she was seven. Her mother, Carin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nilsdotter (<i>b</i>. 1805), died only three years later. In the custody of a singularly gifted aunt in nearby Nyk&ouml;ping, Augusta M&ouml;rth, herself a doctor's widow, young Agnes imbibed her warm spirit and acquired many of her practical (including medical) skills.<br>
<br>Agnes Hedenstr&ouml;m was in her twenties when, as the trusted housekeeper on a large estate (also in S&ouml;dermanland), she experienced a life-transforming event. Delegated by the owners of the estate to report back on disquieting news of religious revival resulting from a roving lay preacher's meetings in the area, she was herself confronted by the claims of &#145;familiar truths which had hitherto lain dormant&#146;  (Lindskog, 13). Initial rancour was replaced by &#145;indescribable joy&#146;. Soon she found herself sharing those same truths first at Sunday school gatherings for the children of the estate, later also among growing numbers of adults.<br>
<br>As word spread of proliferating popular response, overt hostility erupted too among men who rejected the right of women to preach and teach the scriptures. Meanwhile, a powerful sense of call began building in &#145;Mamsell Agnes&#146; to bring the gospel to India or China. True to that call, she left for London in 1876, hoping soon to be sent out by one of England's major mission societies. However, ill health forced her to postpone her plans and instead, on her doctor's insistence, seek recuperation in the coastal climate of south-west England. It was in 1877, on her return to London, that Agnes Hedenstr&ouml;m, now thirty-three, was to realize precisely her future place of mission, and that she would not, after all, have to cross half the globe to reach it.<br>
<br>On learning of a recently opened Strangers' Rest, a mission and reading-room for seafarers of different nationalities in London's East End, Agnes determined to see this for herself. Undeterred by her friends' warnings that the mission's location, on Ratcliffe Highway, was the very hub of London's most notorious Sailortown slums, swarming with crimps and pimps and other so-called &#145;land-sharks&#146;, Agnes Hedenstr&ouml;m set forth from fashionable Kensington, soon to find herself in an entirely different world. Finally forced to submit to police escort, in the midst of drunken brawls and a hail of insults, she was welcomed at the mission by the superintendent, Miss McPherson, as &#145;a direct answer to prayer&#146;  (Lindskog, 17). Among the masses of abused and exploited mariners were many from Scandinavia, and it was quite beyond the mission's capacity to cope with these men. Moving into a humble room in the nearby Home of Industry, Agnes continued as associate missionary at the Strangers' Rest for the next two years, preaching, counselling, and caring for her seafaring fellow ethnics, as well as those from other parts of the world.<br>
<br>By then, word of the woman at the Strangers' Rest, who went alone where police only dared go well armed and in pairs, had reached forecastles on the farthest seas. However, Agnes's keen mind and practical sense soon discerned the need for a radically new strategy. The average sailor ashore had little choice beyond a seamy, bordello-like boarding-house, run by those bent on exploiting him, and the street. With her natural intuition and extraordinary networking skills, coupled with her &#145;glowing faith and contagious enthusiasm&#146;  (Lindskog, 22), she won over a growing group of highly influential friends, foremost among them T. A. Denny. With their help she managed to form a committee, rent a property at 88&#150;90 Leman Street, near Princes Square, and in 1880 open the first Scandinavian Sailors' Temperance Home in the port of London. Here, by offering famished seafarers a quality of care and cuisine clearly superior to that provided by her competitors, she managed to overcome the counter-attraction of alcohol and instil a sense of self-worth in many a marginalized mariner.<br>
<br>In their frustration, the fraternity of local land-sharks launched a smear campaign against their lone adversary. There were even attempts against her life. Beaten, kicked, and spat upon, Agnes Hedenstr&ouml;m nevertheless refused to be intimidated. Instead, she simply redoubled her efforts, even adding a highly valued referral service for seafarers in search of a ship. As a result, the eighty-bed facility was frequently overfilled, as seafarers continued to come in droves. In Agnes Hedenstr&ouml;m's mind there was now only one way to go&#151;build and build boldly. This, she well knew, would depend on the most strategic site and enormous funds. Therefore, she made both the subject of sustained prayer.<br>
<br>An ideal site was soon found&#151;close to the West India Dock's main gate. As to funding, the costs appeared at first prohibitive. But again, Agnes Hedenstr&ouml;m was able to enlist the aid of powerful patrons, notably David Carnegie and Lord Blantyre. Finally, on 13 February 1888, a massive new five-storey Scandinavian Sailors' Temperance Home could be officially dedicated by Prince Oscar Bernadotte of Sweden. Here, that &#145;remarkable girl&#146;, as Carnegie called her, continued to monitor the myriad concerns of this no less remarkable institution to the end of her life. From 21 January 1889, when she married Axel Welin, an engineer and prominent member of the Swedish community in London, she would have the companionship and invaluable support of a devoted husband.<br>
<br>Proprietors of disreputable boarding-houses, bars, and bordellos in the neighbourhood eventually found it futile to harass the home and its indefatigable executive director. The seafarers simply kept coming, literally in their thousands. Here was holistic maritime ministry at its best, and they knew it. Even though the seafarers might put up a vigorous resistance, they consistently surrendered every time she disarmed them with her forthright humour, resolutely removed their hard-earned wages, and sent these off to family back home rather than risk their being squandered in some Sailortown spree. Non-Scandinavian seafarers (including many torpedoed crews during the First World War) would also be fed in the 600-seat dining hall and accommodated as needs arose and space allowed. The home's policy was perhaps best reflected in its founder's maxim: no sailor to be turned away as long as there is one foot of floor space.<br>
<br>Herself never a narrow sectarian, Agnes Welin was warmly endorsed by not only the established (Lutheran) church but also the free churches of her native Sweden (notably the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden). She maintained as firm a hand on the helm after more than fifty years in the work as when she first began. Then, in her eighty-fifth year, after a stroke a few days previously, she died at her post on 23 June 1928. The ceremonies surrounding the return of her remains from London's docklands to her native soil, via G&ouml;teborg and on to Stockholm, were fit for royalty, with innumerable seafarers taking part on either side of the North Sea. While every vessel in port hoisted its flag at half mast, her body was buried at Solna churchyard on 4 July 1928.<br>
<br>&#145;Agnes Welin, the Seafarers' Incomparable Friend&#146;: those were the words, engraved in granite, which were chosen to mark her grave. What was it about her which motivated such a level of love&#151;bordering on infatuation&#151;among the many she served? All available evidence indicates that she was on the one hand utterly fearless, on the other unconditionally compassionate, thereby confirming a calibre of love which could, indeed, &#145;cast out fear&#146;. Agnes Welin had no children of her own, yet she insisted on treating all seafarers as if they were hers by birth. This they felt, regardless of how they might individually respond to the faith she professed with such unflinching persistence. Perhaps that was why they commonly called her not only their friend, but pre-eminently their mother. At all events, &#145;Mother&#146; Agnes Welin achieved among Scandinavian seafarers&#151;and beyond&#151;a renown no less than that of her namesake &#145;Mother&#146; Agnes Weston among the British. Meanwhile, the sailors' home that Agnes Welin raised and ran for forty years, later known as Riverside House, at 20 Garford Street, Poplar, and operated by the Salvation Army as a hostel for the homeless, still stands as a monument to a heroic enterprise.<br>
