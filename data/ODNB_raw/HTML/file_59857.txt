<span class="headword">Maclagan, Sir  Andrew Douglas</span>  (1812&#150;1900), <span class="occ">physician and expert in forensic medicine and public health</span>, born on 17 April 1812 in Ayr, was the eldest of seven sons of David Maclagan and his wife, Jane, daughter of Philip Whiteside, a medical practitioner of Ayr. Maclagan's father was serving as physician to the forces in Portugal at the time of his son's birth and did not see him until &#145;he was eating a mutton chop&#146;. Of the six siblings, two entered the medical profession and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34773/', "William Dalrymple Maclagan (1826&#150;1910)")</script> became the archbishop of York. Maclagan entered Edinburgh high school in 1818. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and graduated MD in 1833. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1831 and a fellow in 1833. After further study in Berlin, Paris, and London, he was elected assistant surgeon to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.<br>
<br>In 1845 Maclagan's interest in chemistry led him to take up extramural teaching of the subject at Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. His forensic career began as a medical witness for the defence of Madeleine Smith on the charge of poisoning her lover, Emil L'Angelier, in 1859, when Robert Christison appeared for the crown. The charge was not proven. Christison and Maclagan became great friends and often appeared together for the crown. Maclagan appeared for the crown with Henry Littlejohn in the trial of Dr Pritchard for the murder of his wife and mother-in-law by poisoning (Glasgow, 1865) and in the trial of Eugene Chantrelle for the drugging and gassing of his wife (Edinburgh, 1878). Both defendants were found guilty and hanged. Maclagan became a leading authority on the analysis of poisons and published important works on the subject, such as <span class="italic">Contributions to Toxicology, Cases of Poisoning</span> (1849).<br>
<br>In 1862 Maclagan was appointed regius professor of forensic medicine and public health at Edinburgh University, succeeding Thomas Trail. He was instrumental in raising the profile of medical practitioners in Scottish public health administration, and immediately entered into the task of instructing undergraduate medical students in the basic rules of public hygiene. He introduced postgraduate teaching in 1875. The BSc in public health, open only to medical graduates, was timely, as Scottish medical officers of health were struggling for the status and recognition given to that office in England and Wales under the 1875 <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span>. Both lecture courses took the English approach to public health, Scottish practice being dealt with separately. The degree examinations consisted of chemistry, medicine, practical sanitation, and sanitary law. The BSc was followed by the establishment of a DSc degree in 1877. Maclagan's postgraduate courses attracted many doctors who took up responsible posts in English public health administration, for example Edward Hope, medical officer of health for Liverpool. At a time when medical practitioners working in Scottish public health were pressing for recognition (they were eventually acknowledged in the 1897 <span class="roman">Public Health Act</span>, Scotland), Maclagan's public health qualifications formed an essential part of the successful argument.<br>
<br>When Maclagan was appointed regius professor he automatically became one of the professors of clinical medicine, and during the later years, when he became the senior professor, he lectured almost entirely on dermatology. It is due to him that a department for skin diseases was formed in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Maclagan retired from the chair of forensic medicine and public health in 1897. The university bestowed upon him the degree of LLD, an honour accorded to him also by Glasgow University in 1881. He was elected president in Edinburgh of both the Royal College of Surgeons (1859&#150;60) and the Royal College of Physicians (1884&#150;7), a distinction shared only with his father. In 1886 he was knighted by Queen Victoria, and between 1890 and 1895 he served as president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Maclagan was married to Elizabeth Allan Thompson. He was an excellent amateur musician and poet, his most notable contribution being &#145;Nugae canorae medicae&#146;, and was a fellow of the Harveian and the Aesculapian societies, delighting the membership with his ballads. He died at 28 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, on 5 April 1900, after a short illness. He was buried four days later in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. Among the pall bearers were his son, Robert Craig Maclagan, and his brother William. His wife had predeceased him.<br>
