<span class="headword">Bloxam,  John Rouse</span>  (1807&#150;1891), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at Rugby on 25 April 1807, the sixth son of Richard Rouse Bloxam DD (1765&#150;1840), under-master of Rugby School for thirty-eight years, and rector of Brinklow and vicar of Bulkington, both in Warwickshire, and his wife, Anne (1767&#150;1835), sister of the painter Sir Thomas Lawrence. Bloxam and his five brothers, who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2706/', "Andrew Bloxam")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2708/', "Matthew Holbeche Bloxam")</script>, were all foundationers at Rugby School. In 1826 Bloxam proceeded to Worcester College, Oxford, where he held a <span class="roman">Bible</span> clerkship. From 1830 to 1835 he held a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, obtaining an honorary fourth class in classics in 1831 and graduating BA in 1832. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Oxford in 1832 and priest in 1833, and took the further degrees of MA in 1835, BD in 1843, and DD in 1847.<br>
<br>In July 1832 Bloxam became chaplain and classical master in the private school at Wyke House, near Brentford, of which Dr Alexander Jamieson was principal, and from 1833 to 1836 he was second master at Bromsgrove School. In 1836 he returned to Magdalen, having been elected a probationer fellow, and resided there until 1862. Among the college offices he held were bursar, vice-president, and librarian (1851&#150;62), though he was never a tutor. In 1837 he succeeded Isaac Williams as curate to J. H. Newman at Littlemore, where he had the opportunity to promote the cause closest to his heart, the revival of ceremonial in the Church of England. Peter Maurice (1803/4&#150;1878), the evangelical chaplain of New College, attacked Bloxam's alterations in church decoration and ritual after a visit to Littlemore  (P. Maurice, <span class="italic">Popery of Oxford</span>, 1837). One of the most zealous followers of the Tractarians, Bloxam caused a scandal in 1839 when it was reported that he had bowed to the host during the celebration of mass during a visit to Alton Towers, the seat of the Roman Catholic earl of Shrewsbury. He resigned the Littlemore curacy in the following year. A carriage accident in a Leicestershire lane introduced him to Ambrose Phillipps De Lisle. They corresponded in 1841 and 1842 on a possible reunion of the Anglican and Roman churches. In 1842 he privately printed an incomplete <span class="italic">Book of Fragments</span>, giving a series of extracts from authorities on ecclesiastical rites. Further publication was halted on the appearance of a similar volume, <span class="italic">Hierugia Anglicana</span>, under the auspices of the Cambridge Camden Society. Bloxam was an early member of the Oxford Society for Promoting the Study of Gothic Architecture, founded in 1839, and became a friend and patron of A. W. Pugin, securing for him the commission for a new gateway to Magdalen College, which was built in 1844. On Christmas eve 1845 he resisted Newman's entreaties to join the Roman communion, but they maintained a regular correspondence and close friendship until Newman's death.<br>
<br>At Magdalen, Bloxam was considered the &#145;incarnation of all that was ideal in the College, its mediaevalism, sentiment, piety&#146;  (W. Tuckwell, <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Oxford</span>, 2nd edn, 1907, 165). At the centre of his room, which was hung with religious icons, was a model of the tomb of the college founder, William Waynflete  (<span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span>, 25 May 1906, 389&#150;90). He edited for the Caxton Society the <span class="italic">Memorial of Bishop Waynflete, by Dr Peter Heylyn</span> (1851) and later collected the series of documents <span class="italic">Magdalen College and James II</span> (Oxford Historical Society, 1886), showing the college's earlier successful resistance to the depredations of the monarch. He particularly cherished the college's choral tradition, and claimed to have been responsible for ensuring, from 1844, a more reverential celebration of the May day custom of singing a Latin hymn on Magdalen College tower (and was a prominent figure in Holman Hunt's depiction of the ceremony, first exhibited in 1891). Although doubt attaches both to his version of the origins of the custom, and how far its celebration altered after 1844, he did succeed in making the ceremony a self-conscious occasion. His subsequent antiquarian labours, inspired by the example of Dr Routh, the college president, were devoted to compiling a biographical register of members of the college; he rose daily at 5.30 in the morning for the purpose. Seven volumes appeared between 1853 and 1881. The venture was continued by W. D. Macray. Bloxam also compiled a bibliography of the works published by members of the college, partly, it was said, to refute Edward Gibbon's aspersions about the idleness of the Magdalen fellows.<br>
<br>In February 1862 Bloxam was appointed by his college to the vicarage of Upper Beeding, near Steyning in Sussex, vacating his fellowship in the following year. He was acknowledged in later life as &#145;the Grandfather of all ritualists&#146;  (Frederic Rogers, Lord Blachford, to Bloxam, 1 Nov 1884, Magd. Oxf., MS 304). By then revivals pioneered by Bloxam, such as the wearing of a black stole by priests and the adornment of altars with elaborately decorated cloths, had become widely adopted within the Church of England. Conspicuous in his Oxford days as &#145;a striking figure, spare and erect, with reverent dignity&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), he enjoyed excellent health almost to the end of his life. Bloxam, who never married, died at The Priory, Upper Beeding, on 21 January 1891 and was buried in Beeding churchyard.<br>
