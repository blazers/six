<span class="headword">Carling, Sir  Ernest Rock</span>  (1877&#150;1960), <span class="occ">surgeon and developer of radiotherapy</span>, was born in Sidney Road, Guildford, Surrey, on 6 March 1877, the third son of Francis Rees Carling, master ironmonger, and his wife, Lydia Colebrook. He was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and King's College, London, and entered the Westminster Hospital medical school at the age of eighteen. His medical training was interrupted by service in the South African War with the Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital as a surgical dresser to Charles Stonham, the Westminster's senior surgeon. On 10 June 1901 Carling married Edith Petra (1872/3&#150;1959), daughter of the Revd Edward Dennis Rock, vicar of Sutton, Woodbridge, Suffolk; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Carling qualified MRCS LRCP in 1901. Early in his university studies he showed both brilliance and versatility, being awarded a gold medal and an exhibition in pharmacology and therapeutics; he also won a further gold medal and scholarship in obstetrics and gynaecology in his final MB (1902). He became BS in 1903 and FRCS in 1904. After graduation he held appointments at the Westminster Hospital, first in the pathology department and then as surgical registrar; in 1906 he was appointed to the honorary consulting staff as assistant surgeon and in 1919 he became full surgeon. On his retirement from the active staff in 1942 he became honorary consulting surgeon.<br>
<br>Carling was a general surgeon of more than average ability and, before the days of specialization, an orthopaedic surgeon of considerable skill. In addition to the Westminster he worked at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, the Peace Memorial Hospital, Watford, the Chislehurst Hospital, and the King Edward VII Convalescent Home for Officers at Osborne. As a member of the Territorial Army he was mobilized on the outbreak of war in 1914 and served as captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps with the 4th London Hospital, and later in France and Flanders.<br>
<br>In many aspects of medical thinking and practice Carling was ahead of his time. The detailed planning of the new Westminster Hospital medical school and its nurses' home in St John's Gardens was as much his as the architect's, and he waited almost five years to see the building completed in the spring of 1939. Carling retained an interest in medical education throughout his career, and remained a member of the academic council of the Westminster medical school until his death. For many years he was a member of the faculty of medicine and of the board of advanced medical studies of the University of London, and he was also a member of the court of examiners at the Royal College of Surgeons, acting for a time as its chairman. He took a wide interest in benevolent activities related to the medical profession and was a member of council of the Royal Medical Benevolent Fund, treasurer of the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men, a trustee of the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust and chairman of its medical advisory committee, and president of the Medical Protection Society.<br>
<br>Carling's interest in the use of radium in the treatment of cancer dated from 1920 when he visited the Fondation Curie in Paris and the radium institutes in Brussels and Stockholm. It was Carling's foresight which enabled Westminster Hospital to open its radium annex in Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, later developed as the radiotherapy department of the new hospital. Carling designed the first models of mass radium units and had them built with the help of physicists; he recognized from the early years that the application of the use of X-rays and radium in medicine needed the special knowledge of physicists to achieve precision, accuracy, and safety.<br>
<br>This scientific approach opened for Carling the door to a second profession which he embraced with enthusiasm and which occupied most of his time after his retirement from active surgical practice. He became a member of the National Radium Commission and the Atomic Energy Commission, chairman of the international commission of radiological protection, and member and for a time chairman of the Standing Advisory Committee on Cancer and Radiotherapy of the Ministry of Health. This second career was even more rewarding for Carling and more beneficial for the country than his earlier surgical achievements. His specialized knowledge resulted in his appointment as consultant adviser to both the Home Office and the Ministry of Labour, as expert adviser to the World Health Organization, and as member of the Medical Research Council. He also became chairman of the advisory committee on medical nomenclature.<br>
<br>Carling was knighted in 1944, made an honorary fellow of the faculty of radiology, received an honorary LLD from Queen's University, Belfast, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. His chief recreation in his early years was to travel and to visit art museums, especially in Italy where for a time he kept a small house. He was a great conversationalist and a lover of books, mostly on scientific subjects. Carling died at his London home, 49 Hallam Street, Portland Place, on 15 July 1960.<br>
