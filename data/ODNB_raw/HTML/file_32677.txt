<span class="headword">Curtis,  Edmund</span>  (1881&#150;1943), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 25 March 1881 in Bury, Lancashire, the fifth of the six children of Francis Curtis, an architectural draughtsman (<i>d</i>. 1918), of Rathmullen, co. Donegal, and his wife, Elizabeth Elliott of Belfast. At fifteen he was working in a rubber factory at Silvertown, east London, and voicing his melancholy in verses which found their way into the weekly press. The resulting publicity brought him two benefactors, through whose generosity he was sent to Allhallows School, Honiton, where one of them, Cecil Grant, was an assistant master. Curtis proved a rewarding pupil. When Grant, in 1898, became headmaster of a new co-educational boarding-school in Keswick, he took Curtis with him as head boy. In 1900 Curtis went to Keble College, Oxford, as a commoner, and gained a first class in modern history four years later.<br>
<br>As a lecturer in history at Sheffield (1905&#150;14) Curtis published <span class="italic">Roger of Sicily</span> (1912) and became recognized as a medieval scholar. He had frequently visited Ireland, and had acquired a working knowledge of Irish, when in 1914 he was appointed professor of modern history at Trinity College, Dublin. Here for the rest of his career he left an abiding impression on his pupils, earning the affection of many whose backgrounds and views were very different from his own. No politician, he &#145;drifted helplessly in the cross-currents of Trinity academic life&#146;  (Lyons, 8). He was never elected to a fellowship, and so remained outside the college's governing circle. Characteristically, he left the residue of his estate as a fund for the benefit of college servants. In 1918 he married Margaret Louise, daughter of Richard Barrington, of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The marriage was dissolved in London in 1925, as a result of his wife's affair with the novelist Liam O'Flaherty. There were no children.<br>
<br>Combining erudition with independence of judgement, appreciative alike of Gaelic and Anglo-Norman civilization, Gaelic-nationalist in sympathy but proud of his protestant and &#145;planter&#146; ancestry, and an admirer of English character and institutions, Curtis had an unusual blend of qualities for an Irish historian. However, he worked too much in isolation, taking little account of changing academic fashion or current research. He remained true to the Stubbsian constitutionalism he had absorbed at Oxford, harnessing it to medieval and modern Irish themes, including what he dubbed, revealingly, &#145;aristocratic Home Rule&#146;. His writing, though warmed by a strong historical imagination, was structurally weak and not always accurate in detail. His editing of documents had technical deficiencies. But he had the merits of a pioneer, and he was a courageous opponent of the narrow sectarianism that marked much that passed for history in Ireland at that time. His <span class="italic">History of Medieval Ireland</span> (1923; 2nd edn, 1938) was unusual for the equal attention it paid to Gaelic and settler society. His outline <span class="italic">History of Ireland</span> (1936) held the field for several decades. His <span class="italic">Calendar of Ormond Deeds</span> (6 vols., 1932&#150;43) unlocked the treasures of the largest medieval archive in Ireland.<br>
<br>Although pensive and solitary, Curtis was well endowed with social gifts and was a memorable talker. One of his pupils has left a sketch of him on a late visit to Donegal: bounding into the saddle of an ancient bicycle; sleeping in a nightcap and nightgown, under which he wore a black silk cravat; carrying raw liver sandwiches in his pockets to ward off the pernicious anaemia that eventually killed him; endlessly curious about local history, dialects, and folklore.<br>
<br>Curtis died at the Elpis Nursing Home, Mount Street, Dublin, on his sixty-second birthday, 25 March 1943, and was buried in the protestant churchyard at Malahide. His work continues to earn respect for the breadth of its sympathies and has found advocates among those who regard an eirenic &#145;present-centredness&#146; as a legitimate part of the Irish historian's calling.<br>
