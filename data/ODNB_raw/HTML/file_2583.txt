<span class="headword">Blake,  Thomas</span>  (1596/7&#150;1657), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Staffordshire. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 25 October 1616, aged nineteen, graduated BA on 5 May 1620 and proceeded MA on 21 February 1623. By about 1630 he had begun a ministry in Tamworth, on the Staffordshire/Warwickshire border. As he reminded the dedicatees of his first publication, <span class="italic">The Birth Priviledge, or, Covenant-Holinesse of Beleevers</span> (1644), &#145;I have served you for Christ a double apprenticeship of yeares almost compleat&#146;. In 1645, following the surrender of Shrewsbury to the parliamentary forces, Blake became vicar of St Alkmund there.<br>
<br>Blake's pamphlet launched him into a sustained controversy over the inclusiveness or exclusiveness of admission to the church's sacraments, conducted with a number of notable protagonists, including eventually his fellow west midlands minister, Richard Baxter of Kidderminster. While he set much store on catechizing the young in order to produce a Christian nation, Blake argued in <span class="italic">The Birth Priviledge</span> for a latitudinarian largeness: the right to baptism was in his view as wide as the name &#145;Christian&#146;; visible penitence from the child's parents was sufficient to satisfy the requirements. In <span class="italic">Infants Baptisme, Freed from Antichristianisme</span> (1645), dedicated to Ruth, Lady Scudamore, he defended the practice against the &#145;assault&#146; on it, and on his previous work, by the baptist Christopher Blackwood in <span class="italic">The Storming of Antichrist</span> (1644). Here Blake was ranged with the eminent minister Stephen Marshall, as he was again in <span class="italic">Mr Blakes Answer to Mr Tombes</span> (1646), a reply to the <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> (1645) of another baptist, John Tombes, who had by this time returned to his native west midlands. In 1648 Blake was among the Shropshire ministers who signed the covenant.<br>
<br>In 1650 Blake and a colleague, with their families, left Shrewsbury, probably owing to an outbreak of plague. With Blake suffering from a fever, and subject to suspicion that they might be carrying infection, the party could find only &#145;mean accommodations&#146; until given hospitality by the Shropshire minister Samuel Hildersham and his wife, Mary. Blake acknowledged their kindness in the dedication to them of his next work, <span class="italic">Vindiciae foederis, or, A Treatise of the Covenant of God Entered with Mankind</span> (1652): &#145;for many months we had free and liberal entertainment &hellip; in your house I had not only leisure to make a good progresse in this work, but singular accommodation from your accomplisht Library&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>). He signed the dedication on 4 November 1652 from his study in Tamworth, having in the interim resumed his ministry there and become an assistant to the local committee of triers and ejectors in its work of regulating the clergy of Staffordshire.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Vindiciae foederis</span> resumed the controversy with John Tombes, but it extended the discussion to consideration of admission to holy communion (on which Blake again advocated inclusiveness), and was also a very oblique attack on Richard Baxter's first work, <span class="italic">Aphorismes of Justification</span> (1649). Blake respected Baxter, praising him when he could, and only attacked the arguments of <span class="italic">Aphorismes</span>, not the man. In 1654 three of Baxter's allies, John Humfrey, Henry Bartlett, and Giles Firmin, were urging him to take up the cudgels against Blake, Firmin reporting that &#145;good men&#146; were being won over to the latter's side  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.150). Baxter duly replied in <span class="italic">Rich. Baxters Apology</span> (1654) and <span class="italic">Rich. Baxters Confession</span> (1655). In May or June 1655 Blake wrote in a conciliatory vein to Baxter, thanking him for the gift of the <span class="italic">Apology</span> and expressing himself &#145;loath indeed to appear your professed adversary&#146;  (ibid., 1.182), but his <span class="italic">The Covenant Sealed</span> (1655), which included a &#145;brief answer&#146; to the <span class="italic">Apology</span>, further antagonized Firmin. On 7 April 1656 Firmin wrote to Baxter that, though he understood that Blake was &#145;very godly&#146;, he dealt &#145;too slightly in such a solemne ordinance&#146;: while he himself did not turn away from the sacrament those whose views on church government differed from his own, he was concerned about the level of ignorance in some of the candidates, which was worthy of &#145;Heathens&#146; or &#145;Indians&#146;  (ibid., 1.207&#150;8). In reply Baxter pronounced <span class="italic">The Covenant Sealed</span> &#145;a Volume of mistakes and passions&#146;, but was persuaded &#145;to handle the Controversie Argumentatively&#146; and to cut out the personal abuse, and advised Firmin to &#145;keep your eye on the Center, where Mr Blake &amp; you &amp; I are one&#146;  (ibid., 1.211&#150;12). This did not prevent Baxter's continuing the exchange in <span class="italic">Certaine Disputations of Right to the Sacraments</span> (1657).<br>
<br>Blake drew up his will on 11 January 1656, when he was enjoying a &#145;good measure of health&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/270, sig. 477), but following an illness he died the following year. He was buried in Tamworth church on 11 June 1657. Anthony Burgess, minister of Sutton Coldfield, who delivered at the funeral <span class="italic">Pauls Last Sermon</span> (1658), remarked on Blake's &#145;Doctrinall abilities&#146;, his wisdom as a spiritual director, his studiousness, and his preaching  (pp. 18, 20). In the controversies that had taken place among the godly, to which Burgess had also been a party, he praised Blake for his willingness to vindicate himself publicly and for giving the lie to those who criticized his &#145;promiscuous admission of all&#146; to the sacraments by his vigilance in catechizing the young. An oration by Samuel Shaw, master at Tamworth school, complemented the picture of a godly pastor. Blake's will was proved by his widow, Jane; as Burgess had noted, he died childless, and his estate was divided between Jane and his brother John, with books and manuscripts left to two clerical nephews, William Blake of Mashfield and Samuel Beresford of Aston, Birmingham.<br>
