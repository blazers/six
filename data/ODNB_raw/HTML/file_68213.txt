<span class="headword">Benson,  Gervase</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">Quaker leader</span>, lived at Haygarth in Sedbergh, Yorkshire, and Kendal, Westmorland; he also had a house at Borratt in Sedbergh. A notary public before 1640, and later commissary of the archdeaconry of Richmond at Kendal, Benson was the first ecclesiastical lawyer to join Kendal corporation, which was dominated by mercers. Elected in December 1640, he became an alderman in April 1641, an unusually rapid promotion.<br>
<br>Early in the civil war the Kendal corporation was subordinated to divisions within the Westmorland gentry between ardent royalists and neutrals. Benson revealed his own political inclinations on 9 May 1644 when he tried unsuccessfully to commit the town to parliament by inviting Lancashire parliamentarian forces to Kendal; however, it was the Scottish invasion of Cumbria in September that brought Kendal under parliamentarian control. Whether or not the Scots' arrival had any influence over his election as mayor of Kendal at Michaelmas 1644, Benson leapfrogged two more senior corporation men into the mayoralty. Thereafter he became a county JP in his own name, despite doubts that he had enough land in Westmorland to qualify, a measure of his rising importance. He was known as Colonel Benson in 1645, and was in command of local forces in the town's small garrison, but recent research has not confirmed twentieth-century claims that he served in the New Model Army. In March 1646 he helped to organize a presbyterian classis in Westmorland.<br>
<br>Benson was driven out of Kendal during the second civil war. However, after parliament's victory he and other parliamentarian aldermen became more prominent in a county and regional administration purged of royalists, and he became known in London. From this local power base Benson and his allies used the 1650 oath of engagement to attack royalist and conservative members of Kendal corporation; their reports prompted the House of Commons in October to remove corporation men who had not taken the oath. The resort to an outside authority not only challenged the town's charter but also suggests that Benson had enjoyed only minority support in the corporation.<br>
<br>While Benson evidently favoured the republic it is not clear how far his religious tenets had moved by late 1650, and his signature to a cleric's augmentation in July 1651 does not suggest he was then a sectarian. Nevertheless a year later, on 6 June 1652, George Fox visited a gathered church at Sedbergh led by Benson, whenceforth the colonel is counted a Quaker. He tried to shield James Naylor in the latter's trial at the Westmorland sessions on 11 January 1653, and later that year he advocated Quaker tenets in public debates in Kendal. Benson's sectarianism found little support among his corporation colleagues, who were busy imprisoning Quakers, and they excluded him in September 1653. In the meantime the corporation and local clerics had begun a pamphlet war against Quakers, to which Benson would answer in 1655. He must have been one of the first Quakers to be removed from office on the grounds of religion, though after his dismissal from Kendal corporation he was for some time still able to protect Quakers through his place in county and national affairs.<br>
<br>The dominance of George Fox in Quaker history has probably undervalued the contribution of Gervase Benson to the early years of Quakerism. Benson was one of the founders of the Friends, and remained involved in the affairs of the notable Quaker Fell family of Swarthmore into the 1670s. He is credited with important early missionary work in London in 1653, and with Quaker fund-raising campaigns. He spoke for northern Quakers in organizational matters, on occasion in opposition to Fox. Benson also had a special interest in tithes. In the autumn of 1653 he and others lobbied parliament for the anti-tithe cause, and with effect: a division in parliament on 10 December 1653, which favoured the abolition of tithes, precipitated the demise of the Nominated Parliament. His wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1656), whom Benson had married before June 1652, was equally active, and, with her neighbour Anne Blaykling, she was imprisoned at York by December 1653 for a period of at least a month. Benson's youngest son, Emanuel, was born during this imprisonment. Gervase wrote against tithes in 1655, and his <span class="italic">Cry of the Oppressed</span> (1656) also publicized Quakers who were persecuted for non-payment of tithe. He was again among those who petitioned parliament over tithe in 1659. Benson's legal training and probate office made him particularly valuable to Quakers on trial, and in dealing with oaths, especially in probate. He contributed in 1655 to a printed discussion of Quaker difficulties with the oath of abjuration.<br>
<br>Benson buried Dorothy at their house at Haygarth on 28 February 1656, and in 1660 he married Mabell, widow of John Camm of Camsgill. After the Restoration, he was credited by the Friends with effective intervention over oaths with Anglican probate officials. He published two books on the issue of oaths, in 1669 and 1675. By about 1678 he had moved back to Kendal; he died there and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground on 5 May 1679. His will, made in 1678, mentions his wife, and three sons and five daughters.<br>
