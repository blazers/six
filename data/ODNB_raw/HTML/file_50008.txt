<span class="headword">Newdigate, Sir  Henry Richard Legge</span>  (1832&#150;1908), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Astley Castle, Nuneaton, Warwickshire, on 24 December 1832, the seventh son of Francis Newdigate and Barbara Legge, daughter of the third earl of Dartmouth. He was born into a large family and was educated at Eton College before purchasing a commission as second lieutenant in the 2nd battalion, the rifle brigade, in September 1851. His elder brother Edward was already serving in the same regiment, and Edward's career in many ways mirrored Henry's own. In June 1854 Henry purchased his lieutenancy, and sailed with the regiment to the Crimea. He was present at the battle of the Alma, in which the rifle brigade was heavily engaged, and in March 1855 was promoted captain in the field and given a company command. He was, however, appointed to depot duties thereafter, and to his disappointment had no further chance to distinguish himself. In 1857 Newdigate was sent to India with the troops to suppress the mutiny. He took part in the action at Cawnpore and the relief of Lucknow. His energy and adaptability apparently brought him to the notice of his superiors, and he was selected to join an experimental camel corps, with which he served throughout the central Indian campaign. Although his service was appreciated by his commanding officer and recognized by the award of a brevet majority, he saw no further active service for the next twenty years.<br>
<br>Newdigate was promoted substantive major in May 1868. In June 1875 he was appointed to the command of the 4th battalion of the rifle brigade, which was then stationed in India. In 1878 in the Second Anglo-Afghan War Newdigate was attached to the Peshawar valley field force. He served throughout the war, but much of the fighting&#151;and therefore laurels&#151;fell to Major-General Roberts, who emerged from it with a reputation which overshadowed the officers under his command. Newdigate commanded the Kurram valley field force from April 1880 until it was disbanded the following autumn, but was disappointed that he had found no opportunity to shine. The campaign earned him a brevet colonelcy and the CB, but was his last opportunity to command troops in the field. His appointment as commander of the 4th battalion having expired, he returned to the United Kingdom, and the rest of his career was spent in several significant but unglamorous peace-time appointments. Between 1883 and 1886 he commanded the rifle depot at Winchester, and in 1886 he married Phillis, the daughter of the Revd Arthur Shirley. They had one son and three daughters. In December 1886 he was promoted major-general, and in 1888 he was appointed to the command of the infantry brigade in Gibraltar. He left in 1897, when he was created KCB. He was made colonel commanding the rifle brigade in June 1897, and retired in April 1898. His wife died in 1906. He died at Northgate House, Warwick, on 17 January 1908 from the effects of a seizure he had suffered a week before. He was buried on 21 January near his home at Allesley, near Coventry. Newdigate's career in many ways typified the late Victorian officer class; he was a competent soldier who lacked the flair and luck to achieve popular renown and royal favour, but instead progressed steadily through service in a number of campaigns and peace-time posts to achieve high rank.<br>
