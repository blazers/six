<span class="headword">Philipps,  Fabian</span>  (1601&#150;1690), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born at Prestbury, Gloucestershire, on 28 September 1601, the son of Andrew Philipps. His father, who belonged to an old Herefordshire family, owned estates at Leominster; his mother, whose family, the Bagehots, had settled at Prestbury for four hundred years, was heir to one of her brothers. Philipps studied first at one of the inns of chancery, and afterwards at the Middle Temple. He was also at Oxford during 1641, studying at the Bodleian Library, but was not a graduate of either Oxford or Cambridge. In 1641 he was appointed filazer of London, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire, in the court of common pleas. His claim to the emoluments of the office was disputed, and fourteen years later the case was still unsettled.<br>
<br>Two days before Charles I's execution, Philipps wrote a &#145;protestation&#146; which he printed, and &#145;caused to be put on all posts and in all common places&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.6). It was published with the title <span class="italic">King Charles the First no man of blood; but a martyr for his people, or, A sad and impartiall enquiry whether the king or parliament began the warre</span> (1649). <span class="italic">The Royall Martyr</span> (1660) continues the theme, and in an appendix lists all those who had a hand in the treatment of the king, and ends with the execution:<blockquote>His Executioners disguised with Vizards; yet was his Majesty not affrighted &hellip; he stooped down to the block as to a prayer-desk, and most humbly bowed his generous Neck to God, to be cut off by the Vizarded Executioner, which was suddainly done at one blow. Thus fell King <i>Charles</i>, and all <i>Britain</i> with him. (<span class="italic">Royall Martyr</span>, appendix)</blockquote>On the suppression of the court of chancery in 1653, Philipps published <span class="italic">On the Court of Chancery and the Courts of Justice at Westminster</span> (1653), for which he received the thanks of William Lenthall, speaker of the House of Commons. He wrote three works against the abolition of tenures by knight service: <span class="italic">Tenenda non tollenda</span> (1660), <span class="italic">Ligeancia lugens, or, Loyaltie lamenting the many great mischiefs and inconveniences which will fatally and inevitably follow the taking away of the royal pourveyances and tenures in capite</span> (1661), and <span class="italic">The Mistaken Recompense for Pourveyance and Tenures</span> (1664).<br>
<br>Repairing the harm done against tradition and divine authority by the act of regicide occupied Philipps's career for many years after the Restoration. His work is characterized by its length; many of his publications extend over several hundred pages. There is also dense and detailed argument in favour of the authority of the monarch, derived from classical and biblical sources, chronicles, and court records from all periods.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1661 Philipps and John Moyle received a grant, with survivorship, of the office of remembrancer of the court of the council in the marches of Wales. In his eightieth year he still retained his &#145;great memory&#146;. He died on 17 November 1690 and was buried near his wife in the south-west part of the church of Twyford, near Acton, Middlesex. He wrote his own epitaph some years before his death. Philipps &#145;was eminent in his time, considering that his parts were never advanc'd, when young, by academical education&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>); according to John Aubrey, he was &#145;of great assiduity and reading, and a great lover of antiquities&#146;.<br>
