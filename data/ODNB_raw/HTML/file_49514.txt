<span class="headword">Wiltshire,  Walter</span>  (1718/19&#150;1799), <span class="occ">carrier</span>, is of obscure origins; little is known about his early life, except that he had one brother. The Wiltshires came from the north Somerset countryside, but by the early eighteenth century men of that name were at work in Bath as cordwainers and pack-saddle makers. By the mid-1730s &#145;Wiltshire's Flying Waggons&#146; were making weekly return journeys between Bath and London.<br>
<br>The Wiltshire family had a long and lucrative interest in the eponymous Wiltshire's Assembly Rooms in Bath, the lease of which was taken over on the death of their parents in the mid-eighteenth century by Walter's brother John. Walter himself took charge of the waggons, and from at least 1755 the carrying trade to London was operated from a warehouse in Bristol as well as Bath, with a continuity, and degree of activity, unrivalled in the region. Walter married Charity, daughter of the Bath maltster John Dallamore; they had at least six children between 1756 and her death in 1763.<br>
<br>Walter Wiltshire made a substantial fortune from the carrying trade, but his business interests no doubt also benefited from the attention he gave to public affairs. A member of the common council of Bath from 1746, he was also a trustee of the Bath Turnpike Roads from their reorganization in 1757, and a member of the Bath improvement commission from its inception in 1789. These duties gave him influence in practical matters such as the improvement of the roads in and around Bath, and a financial freedom that came from his handling of the funds of the Bath Trust for much of the second half of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>By the mid-eighteenth century the family had begun to acquire property east of Bath, especially at Shockerwick in the parish of Bathford. This was consolidated, after the death of his brother in 1762, by Walter's acquisition of more land, and by his commissioning of the architect, John Palmer, to design a grand mansion to replace the derelict manor house. Shockerwick House was completed about 1775. From then until his death, Walter Wiltshire enjoyed the dignity of being a JP for Somerset, despite the fact that the estate continued to be supported by the profits of the carrying trade. The goods carried included many paintings by his friend, Thomas Gainsborough, some of which were rolled up for the journey to London. As a cultured man Wiltshire enjoyed payment in kind, especially of paintings like <span class="italic">The Harvest Waggon</span> (presented to Wiltshire in 1774 by the painter) which showed family members in familiar scenery. Of the carrier himself no portrait survives, but he was included with other worthies in a satirical etching of 1763 known as <span class="italic">The Knights of Baythe</span>, with a totem road waggon for a head.<br>
<br>Wiltshire died on 13 October 1799, in his eighty-first year. Like his wife, he was buried at Woolley church, near Bath, on 25 October. After his death the Shockerwick estate remained in the hands of his family for the next hundred years, in the course of which they made an informal assumption of the right to hold arms. Their crest, showing the white head of a horse with crimson bridle over a blue and white wreath, though held improperly, paid a fitting tribute to the source of the wealth amassed so successfully by Walter Wiltshire.<br>
