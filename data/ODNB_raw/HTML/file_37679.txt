<span class="headword">Lister, Sir  (Robert) Ashton</span>  (1845&#150;1929), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 4 February 1845 in Dursley, Gloucestershire, the third of four sons and the sixth of eight children of George Lister, tanner and wire card maker of Dursley, and his second wife, Louisa Richards, who came from a Dursley family of maltsters. He was educated at Dursley Agricultural and Commercial Grammar School and then at schools in Banbury, D&uuml;sseldorf, and Versailles, before joining his father's business.<br>
<br>Lister became estranged from his father and in 1867 set up on his own as a repairer of farm machinery, thus beginning the firm of R. A. Lister &amp; Co. Soon he began manufacturing a range of agricultural and dairy equipment, much of which was exported. Lister travelled widely, promoting trade vigorously, and by 1911 had visited North America fifteen times. His company was not afraid to diversify, and from 1905 to 1914 it produced Dursley-Pedersen bicycles. In 1901 production of woodware began, which by 1909 included teak garden seats, and in 1908 came petrol engines, developed in 1929 into the famous range of diesels. Also in 1908 production began of the equally renowned sheep-shears.<br>
<br>As an employer, Lister was paternalistic and somewhat autocratic, but benevolent. He drove himself hard, expecting his workforce to do the same, but he was quick to provide them with social benefits&#151;housing in 1901 and 1908, a hospital and benefit scheme in 1917, holidays with pay, and a consultative board of directors and workers' representatives in 1927. The greatest benefit was to the local community as a whole: as Listers grew so the area climbed to prosperity from the depression that followed the collapse of the woollen trade.<br>
<br>Lister's activities extended into the community. In 1883 he was elected bailiff of Dursley and in 1893 was appointed a JP. In 1889 he was elected as first county councillor for Dursley, a position he held for thirty years and which was followed by nine years as county alderman. He supported a great variety of movements both by his presence and financially, including temperance, welfare, council housing, and education. The mainsprings of his activity were his religious and political convictions. Brought up by an agnostic father, he was introduced to church life by his wife and by 1899 he was a trustee of Dursley Congregational Church and a keen supporter of nonconformity in general. In recognition of his public work he was knighted in the 1911 new year's honours and in 1919 appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Apart from his council work, Lister found time to address with technical skill and lucidity trade problems such as marketing and exporting agricultural produce, the new techniques of refrigeration and of drying milk, food adulteration, and the wartime rationalization of flour and bread movements to prevent price rises. Politically he was a Liberal and a strong supporter of free trade and of the social reforms of David Lloyd George. He made three attempts to enter parliament (for Tewkesbury) before succeeding in 1918, when he stood for Stroud as a coalition candidate. He held the seat until 1922.<br>
<br>Lister was a man of large, spare frame, standing 6 feet tall, with a keen eye and forceful presence. He had a highly retentive memory and was an accomplished and lively speaker. He was a good judge of character, hated hypocrisy, and had no time for conceit. Discussing a sermon with a workman was as pleasurable to him as dining with his friend the prime minister H. H. Asquith.<br>
<br>In 1866 Lister married Frances Ann (<i>d</i>. 1911), daughter of John Box of Dursley, a watchmaker. They had four sons, the eldest of whom died in 1895; from the family of the second, Charles, came the five grandsons who as a team continued the family firm until it was sold in 1965 to the Hawker Siddeley Group. Lister died at his home, The Towers, Dursley, on 6 December 1929, and was buried in the cemetery of the Dursley Tabernacle United Reformed Church.<br>
