<span class="headword">Boswell,  Alexander</span>, Lord Auchinleck  (1707&#150;1782), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Auchinleck, Ayrshire, on 1 March 1707 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, the eldest of three sons of James Boswell (<i>c</i>.1676&#150;1749), laird of Auchinleck and advocate, and Lady Elizabeth Bruce, the youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3723/', "Alexander Bruce, second earl of Kincardine")</script>. Like his father Alexander Boswell studied law at Leiden University, where he passed advocate on 22 July 1727. He was named sheriff of Wigtownshire in 1748 but resigned in 1750, though he was proud that he had been in the first group appointed by royal warrant rather than the holder of a heritable jurisdiction.<br>
<br>On 15 February 1754 Boswell was appointed to the court of session and on 22 July of the following year to the court of justiciary, the highest courts in Scotland for civil and criminal causes respectively. He took his title, as was the custom, from the estate he had inherited in 1749, an extensive barony in Ayrshire which James IV had conferred on Thomas Boswell in 1504. The estate had 600 tenants and yielded an annual income of &pound;1000, to which Lord Auchinleck's judicial appointments added &pound;900 p.a. In 1780 he resigned from the court of justiciary because of ill health but he retained his seat as an ordinary lord, despite diminished faculties, until his death in 1782.<br>
<br>In April 1738 Boswell married his first cousin once removed, Euphemia Erskine (1718&#150;1766), the youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Erskine, deputy governor of Stirling Castle, and his third wife, Euphemia Cochrane. Five children were born to the Boswells, of whom three sons survived: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2950/', "James Boswell (1740&#150;1795)")</script>, advocate and biographer of Samuel Johnson; John (1743&#150;<i>c</i>.1798), briefly lieutenant in the army and periodically deranged from the age of nineteen; and David, later known as Thomas David, or T. D. (1748&#150;1826), merchant in Spain, banker, and finally inspector in the navy pay office. The family lived on the fourth storey of Blair's Land, Parliament Close, Edinburgh, where Boswell himself had grown up. After 1749 they moved during court recesses to Auchinleck, where in 1762 Lord Auchinleck built a beautiful mansion in the Adam style, the third (and surviving) house on his estate.<br>
<br>On 25 November 1769, aged sixty-two and three years a widower, Lord Auchinleck married again, in Edinburgh; his second wife was his cousin, Elizabeth Boswell (<i>bap</i>. 1729, <i>d</i>. 1799), the second daughter of John Boswell of Balmuto, Fife. (His outraged son James married his cousin Margaret Montgomerie on the same day.) In January 1782 Lord Auchinleck bought a handsome house in the New Town, Edinburgh, and willed his wife the life-rent, thus further incensing James Boswell. He died in Edinburgh on 30 August 1782, after long suffering from stricture of the urethra, and was entombed on 4 September in the catacombs of the family church at Auchinleck.<br>
<br>Lord Auchinleck was a widely respected judge, upright, learned, hard-working, and skilful at clarifying complicated matters. Stern but reputedly impartial, he spoke broad Scots from the bench and leavened his sobriety with straightfaced irony. He was a staunch whig and a strict Presbyterian, as the world knows from the argument with Samuel Johnson that James Boswell reported, circumspectly, in <span class="italic">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>.<br>
<br>Though &#145;perhaps too anxiously devoted to utility&#146;  (James Boswell to William Johnson Temple, 17 April 1764, MS Yale L 1220), Lord Auchinleck was a fine classical scholar and accumulated an impressive library, as attested by the catalogue that Margaret Montgomerie compiled shortly after she had been made mistress of Auchinleck House (the manuscript is at Yale University Library). A cautious laird in an age of improvement, Lord Auchinleck pioneered an industrial village, chiefly dedicated to weaving (unprofitable to the inhabitants), and divided and enclosed farms, but except for distinctive plantations of trees he was slower than his neighbours in adopting new agricultural methods.<br>
<br>Since the publication of James Boswell's papers in the twentieth century Lord Auchinleck has been identified as the embittered father in a classic struggle: well-meaning and generous on his own terms but authoritarian, cold, and harsh&#151;&#145;If my sons are idiots, can I help it?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Laird of Auchinleck</span>, 467). As he lay dying his heir &#145;wept; for alas! there was not affection between us&#146;  (ibid., 477).<br>
