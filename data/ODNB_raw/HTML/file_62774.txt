<span class="headword">Lewis,  Essington</span>  (1881&#150;1961), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 13 January 1881 in Burra Burra, South Australia, the third son and third child in the family of four sons and two daughters of John Lewis (1844&#150;1923), a partner in Bagot, Shakes, and Lewis Ltd, a stock and station agency, and later a member of the legislative council of South Australia, and his wife, Martha Ann Brook (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of an excise inspector. He was educated at the collegiate school of St Peter, Adelaide, and from 1901 to 1904 at the South Australian School of Mines and Industries, Adelaide, where he trained as a mining engineer.<br>
<br>In 1904 Lewis took a job as a miner with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd (BHP) at Broken Hill, New South Wales, founded in 1885 to mine the silver and lead deposits, a company which was to become one of the largest industrial concerns in Australia. In 1905, after gaining his diploma, he was transferred to the company's smelting works at Port Pirie, on the South Australian coast. On 12 April 1910 he married Gladys Rosalind (<i>d</i>. 1954), social worker, daughter of James Cowan, mining investor and grazier: they had two sons and three daughters. By 1913 Lewis had been promoted assistant manager, with the challenge of expanding the output of ironstone at the quarry at Iron Knob, across Spencer's Gulf from Port Pirie, ready for the opening of the steelworks at Newcastle, New South Wales. When the steelworks, a new venture for BHP, opened in 1915, it prospered owing to the increased demand for steel during the First World War. Lewis was then put in charge of the BHP contract to manufacture light artillery shells. His attempt to enlist in the army in 1916 was blocked by G. D. Delprat, general manager of BHP, and in 1919 he was promoted to the post of assistant general manager. In 1920, with Harold Darling, a director of BHP, who was to become one of his closest friends, he went on a tour of steelworks and iron mines in North America and Britain, his first overseas tour: his next world tour took him to South Africa in 1925, and from then on he made an overseas tour about every five years. The BHP steelworks were unable to compete in the early 1920s with the cheaper steel imported from Europe, and were forced to close from 1922 to 1923. General manager from 1921, in 1926 Lewis was appointed managing director by Harold Darling, then chairman of BHP, and was given a seat on the board.<br>
<br>After the economic depression of the early 1930s, with the reduced demand for steel, the fortunes of BHP began to revive at the end of 1932. By the mid-1930s the company was producing steel at prices comparable to those in Europe, despite having to pay higher wages because of the Australian labour laws, and output grew to twice that of before the depression. When, in 1935, BHP merged with Australian Iron and Steel Ltd, the other Australian steelworks, the new subsidiary company, with Lewis as manager and Darling as chairman, became the largest steel producer in the British Commonwealth.<br>
<br>In 1934 Lewis visited Japan on his tour of the Far East, and, although he was allowed to see only two steelworks, he became aware of the rapid expansion of the Japanese steel industry and saw that war with Japan was inevitable. Convinced that Australia would be unable to meet an armed attack, Lewis from then on organized BHP to prepare for war. The company began to stockpile coal and iron ore and raw materials, opened a new factory in Newcastle to manufacture shell cases, organized the manufacture of special steel needed to make machine tools, and in 1939 began to build a shipyard at Whyalla, which launched its first ship in 1941: this became the largest shipyard in Australia. Because Australia had few fighter aircraft, in 1938 Lewis formed a syndicate, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, with BHP as the major shareholder, to build aircraft for the Australian government, and the first forty Wirraway fighter bombers went into production in 1938. It was Lewis more than anyone else who helped Australia prepare for the war against Japan.<br>
<br>Appointed chief general manager in 1938, Lewis was invited to chair the advisory panel on industrial reorganization, a panel of businessmen set up by the government to advise on the mobilization of industry for war. He was also business consultant to the department of defence. But it was not until the fall of France in May 1940 that the prime minister, Robert Menzies, realizing that Australia could no longer rely on Britain to supply munitions, set up a new department of munitions, and appointed Lewis director-general. With a seat on the defence committee, and very wide powers, he was able to control the production of all munitions and vehicles, and the tools with which to make them. From his headquarters in Melbourne he planned new factories and converted hundreds of existing factories to the manufacture of munitions, while recruiting leading industrialists to form a board of directors: within six months he had quadrupled the output of munitions. At the same time Lewis remained, throughout the war, chief general manager of BHP, refusing to be paid by the government, and because of this many politicians and union leaders called for his removal, on the suspicion that he was jeopardizing the Australian war effort for the sake of higher profits for BHP. This was despite the fact that BHP was supplying steel at a lower price than the American and British steelworks were charging their governments. With the fall of Menzies in August 1941, and the subsequent appointment of John Curtin as prime minister, Lewis was given even more power when in January 1942 he was appointed director-general of the department of aircraft production and was able to organize the manufacture of Boomerang fighter aircraft, capable of defending Australian cities from Japanese bombing attacks. By the time Japan entered the war in December 1941, Australia was largely self-sufficient in munitions and was in a position to supply munitions and aircraft to the allies in the fight against the Japanese in the Pacific. Lewis refused to be considered for a knighthood, but he was appointed a CH in 1943.<br>
<br>Lewis resigned his government positions in May 1945 to concentrate on BHP. He led the way in the mechanization of the coal industry, opened new ironstone quarries at Whyalla, and in 1948 began to build a new complex of mills at Port Kembla to produce tin plate. Elected chairman of BHP in 1950, he stepped down in 1952, remaining as deputy chairman.<br>
<br>Lewis held many public appointments, and was chairman of the Industrial Design Council of Australia. He helped to create the Australian Administrative Staff College at Mount Eliza, Victoria, and served as chairman from 1954 to 1959. He was instrumental in the establishment by BHP of chairs of mineralogy at the universities of Melbourne and Adelaide, and as an honorary fellow of the Australian Academy of Science he chaired the fifth Mining and Metallurgical Congress in 1953. Among his many awards were the Bessemer gold medal of the Iron and Steel Institute, London, awarded in 1944, and the gold medal of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, London, in 1954. He published three books about the Australian iron and steel industry, including <span class="italic">The Importance of the Iron and Steel Industry to Australia</span> (1948).<br>
<br>An excellent sportsman in his youth&#151;star of Australian rules football and a celebrated polo player&#151;Lewis remained energetic all his life, displaying great stamina during his frequent journeys to all the BHP plants, quarries, mines, and mills. He died on 2 October 1961 of a heart attack while riding round Landscape, his 3500 acre sheep station at Tallarook, Victoria, and was cremated on 4 October.<br>
