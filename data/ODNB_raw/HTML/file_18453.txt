<span class="headword">Mayo,  Charles</span>  (1837&#150;1877), <span class="occ">army medical officer</span>, born at Winchester on 13 January 1837, was the elder son of Charles Mayo (1788&#150;1876), senior surgeon at Winchester County Hospital. He was elected on the foundation of Winchester College in 1847, and of New College, Oxford, where he became fellow in 1858. He graduated BA in 1859, BM in 1865, and DM in 1871; and he became MRCS in 1861 and MRCP in 1869. In October 1862 he travelled to the United States, where he was staff surgeon-major and medical inspector of the 13th US army corps with Grant's army at the siege of Vicksburg. He later published an account of his experiences in America, in Francis Galton's <span class="italic">Vacation Tourists</span> (1864).<br>
<br>The next few years Mayo spent partly at Oxford, where he was coroner of the university (1865&#150;9) and dean of New College, and partly in London as physician to the General Dispensary in Bartholomew Close. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 Mayo joined the medical service of the German army as staff surgeon-major, and he was appointed director of the Alice Hospital at Darmstadt, which was built under his supervision. In the nine months of its existence, about 700 German and 250 French soldiers were treated, and only fifty-one died. At the close of the war Mayo received five decorations, and the thanks of the German ministry of war. He was also made a knight of the Hessian order of Philip the Generous. During the campaign in Atchin he served with the Dutch medical service, and he went with the expedition from the Netherlands to Sumatra in 1873&#150;4, his account of which appeared in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 19 October 1874.<br>
<br>Being unwilling to settle in England Mayo sailed for Fiji as one of the government medical officers in 1875. Here, he had an acute attack of dysentery, and he died on the voyage to Sydney. Mayo was buried at sea on 15 July 1877. He was unmarried.<br>
