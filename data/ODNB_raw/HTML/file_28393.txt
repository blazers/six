<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wager, Sir  Charles</span>  (1666&#150;1743), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born at Rochester, Kent (not West Looe as is sometimes reported), after the death on 24 February 1666 of his father, Captain Charles Wager (<i>b</i>. 1630), who had started life as a boatswain in the merchant service and had become a lieutenant, then a captain, in the navy of the Commonwealth. His paternal grandfather was John Wager (<i>d</i>. 1656) of St Margaret's, Rochester, who became a mariner after migrating from Charlton Kings, Cheltenham. Wager's mother was Prudence (<i>b</i>. 1640/41), daughter of Vice-Admiral William Goodson, who had come into the Commonwealth navy as captain of a merchant ship converted to a warship and became a renowned officer. With ample justification Wager remarked in 1731, &#145;On both sides I am related to the navy&#146;  (Coxe, 3.116).<br>
<br>Wager's father had promptly accepted the Restoration. He commanded the <i>Yarmouth</i> in the fleet that brought Charles II to England and quickly proved to be a capable, trustworthy, well-liked officer of the Royal Navy. Two years after the elder Wager's death, Samuel Pepys heard a friend who had been at Tangier contrast his conduct with that of others who had served in the Strait of Gibraltar, remarking, as Pepys noted, &#145;that above all Englishmen that ever was there, there never was any man that behaved himself like poor Charles Wager, whom the very Moores do mention with teares sometimes&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9.137). After her husband's death, Wager's mother married a Quaker, Alexander Parker, a London merchant. There was already an older sister, Prudence, and the marriage produced six more children. With his father dead and his maternal grandfather severed from the navy in 1660 (Goodson's radicalism was indelible), young Charles lacked the usual professional advantages of his parentage.<br>
<br>Wager was apprenticed to a Quaker merchant captain of New England named John Hull, son of Tristram and Blanche Hull, both Quakers, of Barnstable, Massachusetts. Tristram was a sea captain and substantial citizen and John operated a transatlantic shipping service and eventually settled in Rhode Island. Wager's mother was a witness when John Hull married Alice Teddeman in the London Quaker Meeting in 1684. When Dr Teddeman Hull, their oldest son, visited London in 1742 he had a letter of introduction from Governor Richard Ward of Rhode Island which stated that he was &#145;the son of Captain John Hull, late of this colony, under whom Sir Charles Wager was educated&#146;  (Kimball, 1.215). There is clear evidence that the mature Wager continued to care about the Hull family, but how much time he spent in New England as a boy is not known.<h2>
<a name="Lieutenantcaptainandcommodore16891709"></a>Lieutenant, captain, and commodore, 1689&#150;1709</h2>The earliest record of Wager's naval service is his listing as lieutenant of the frigate <i>Foresight</i> on 1 August 1689. By 1691 he had become first lieutenant of the <i>Dreadnought</i> (64 guns). On 8 December that year he married Martha Earning (<i>b</i>. 1664&times;6, <i>d</i>. 1748), daughter of Anthony Earning, a Commonwealth navy captain who went into the East India Company's service after 1660 and died while captain of the <i>George</i> in the Indian Ocean. Wager was in the <i>Britannia</i>, Admiral Edward Russell's flagship, in 1692, took part in the battle of Barfleur, and was made post captain on 7 June.<br>
<br>The year 1693 saw Wager in command of the <i>Samuel and Henry</i> (44 guns), in which he convoyed the New England trade. He was captain of the <i>Newcastle</i> (48 guns) in 1694, and in 1695, after a month in the <i>Mary</i>, he was re-assigned to the <i>Woolwich</i> (54 guns). In early March 1696 the <i>Woolwich</i> was watching Dunkirk against a rumoured invasion. A month later Wager moved to the <i>Greenwich</i> (50 guns) and commanded a small squadron for convoying the tobacco trade home from the Chesapeake. He stayed in the <i>Greenwich</i> until she was paid off in late 1699. Finally, on half pay, he lived at Kilminorth near West Looe (in the Watergate cottages near the river), a place where he had already established his family by June 1699 when the ship was under repair at Plymouth. He immediately became a freeman of that borough. As he informed the Admiralty in June 1700, his residence was only &#145;about ten miles from his Majesty's Yard at Plymouth&#146; and he could &#145;be at London in four or five days, if required&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/2637&#150;8).<br>
<br>Evidently Wager was eager for employment and eight months later, in February 1701, he was appointed to the <i>Medway</i> (64 guns). In the mobilization of January 1702 he was assigned to the <i>Hampton Court</i> (70 guns) and remained her captain for the next five years. He commanded a squadron of four of the line and two frigates that cruised between Cape Barfleur and the Isle of Batz in early 1703. Later that year he went to the Mediterranean and in October he came under the command of Admiral George Byng (later Lord Torrington). The occasion having arisen for renegotiating England's treaty with the dey of Algiers, captains Wager and John Baker were the men Byng sent ashore to carry out negotiations and witness the signing. Going again to the Mediterranean in 1704, Wager was with the fleet under Sir George Rooke that captured Gibraltar. The <i>Hampton Court</i> was on detached service and missed the battle off Malaga, but she was present at the capture of Barcelona in 1705. After wintering with Sir John Leake's squadron at Lisbon, Wager took part in the relief of Barcelona and the winning over of Ibiza and Majorca before returning home with Leake in late 1706.<br>
<br>As a senior captain who had commanded detached squadrons Wager was a logical choice for the West Indies command. Appointed in January 1707, he left Spithead in the <i>Expedition</i> (70 guns) on 28 March and reached Jamaica on 22 June. A French squadron under Admiral Ducasse was known to be coming from Europe, and Wager's initial deployments were designed to gain intelligence of its arrival and protect trade. He learned in December that Ducasse had gone to Havana, far to leeward; thus the French squadron (ten of the line) could neither surprise Jamaica nor shield the galleons at the isthmus, and if those galleons were to follow their usual practice of returning to Cartagena before proceeding to Havana, Wager would have a chance to intercept them after they loaded Peruvian silver at Portobello. The <i>Expedition</i>, <i>Kingston</i> (60 guns), and <i>Portland</i> (50 guns) plus a fireship left Port Royal in time to attain, on 23 May 1708, a position about 36 miles west of Cartagena.<br>
<br>Five days later seventeen ships appeared to the south-west. Most proved to be armed; the broadsides of the three largest matched those of Wager's squadron. A shift of wind direction prevented the Spanish from steering for Cartagena. Though forced to tack to the northward, they did not try to flee; rather, they formed a loose line of battle under easy sail: the admiral in the <i>San Josef</i> (64 guns) in the centre; the vice-admiral, also in a 64-gun ship, in the rear; and the rear-admiral in the <i>Santa Cruz</i> (50 guns) in the van, the large warships spaced about half a mile apart with armed merchant ships in between. The Spanish admiral evidently did not believe that the small British squadron would dare oppose this force.<br>
<br>Wager, however, did not hesitate. He ordered the <i>Kingston</i> to attack the vice-admiral and the <i>Portland</i> to attack the rear-admiral. The former closed sluggishly and the latter held back while Wager bore down on the admiral. The <i>Expedition</i>'s guns roared just as the sun was setting and the fighting continued as darkness fell. Suddenly, an hour and a half into the engagement, the <i>San Josef</i> blew up. She sank instantly, carrying the admiral, officers, passengers, and crew&#151;almost 700 in all&#151;to the bottom along with most of the registered silver. Less than half a pistol shot away, Wager's ship was showered with large planks and fiery splinters, but the greatest hazard came from the wash of the blast when it flooded through the gun ports. As the crew feverishly put out fires and worked the pumps, the Spanish squadron scattered; the moon had not yet risen, but Wager could discern the shadow shape of a large ship not far off and steered for it. It was the <i>Santa Cruz</i>. His first broadside blasted through her stern and took down the mizzen yards. Unable to manoeuvre and observing that the other British men-of-war had been drawn by the gunfire, the Spanish rear-admiral surrendered. Total British losses were six killed and eleven wounded, all in the <i>Expedition</i>. The <i>Santa Cruz</i> carried a great deal of unregistered treasure, the property of passengers and private merchants.<br>
<br>Wager's flagship, having suffered damage, taken aboard 300 prisoners, and supplied a prize crew for the <i>Santa Cruz</i>, was unable to act against the remaining Spanish ships. He expected that they would turn back towards Cartagena, and just before sunrise he saw them. He signalled the <i>Kingston</i> and <i>Portland</i> to chase, a signal he had to repeat when, to his consternation, they broke off. The Spanish vice-admiral barely managed to find refuge in shoal waters. Back at Port Royal, Wager convened a court martial that deprived both captains, Timothy Bridges and Edward Windsor, of their commands. The Spanish authorities were so shocked by the attack that for the rest of the war Peruvian silver had to be transported in more difficult ways.<br>
<br>Wager returned to England a rich man. He also came home a rear-admiral, the promotion having occurred by seniority on 19 November 1707. His wealth stemmed chiefly from the silver on the captured galleon, its value estimated at over &pound;60,000, but also from his flag share of other prizes taken in the West Indies. Nevertheless Wager gained the merchants' praise for his conduct in protecting their trade. The action against the galleons made him a hero and he was knighted on 8 December 1709. At Portsmouth he was nominated for a by-election to parliament and was elected on 23 January 1710.<h2>
<a name="Admiralanddiplomat"></a>Admiral and diplomat</h2>Notwithstanding the tory landslide Wager was re-elected at Portsmouth in 1710, but the tory-dominated house overturned the result on petition. As a firm whig he could no longer expect an important command. Having spent all but two of the last twenty years in sea service and now possessing fame and fortune, he was prepared to spend the rest of his life ashore. There is no record of his residing again at Kilminorth though he served as MP for West Looe from 1713 to 1715.<br>
<br>Two days after Queen Anne died Wager was ordered to take charge of the ships at Portsmouth, and in December 1714 he was ordered to go out to the Strait of Gibraltar and assume command of the Mediterranean Fleet. Instead he opted for civil employment ashore; he became comptroller of the navy, at the head of the Navy Board. In January 1715 he was once again elected MP for Portsmouth. Three years later, in March 1718, he moved to the Board of Admiralty, where he remained until almost the end of his life; his tenure on that board, twenty-four consecutive years, was longer than anyone else's in the eighteenth century. In 1720 Wager leased Hollybush, a stately brick house, evidently rebuilt in the Queen Anne style (demolished 1884) and situated at the south-east corner of Parson's Green, Fulham. He spent twenty-two years there and seems to have loved the place. He remained on the list of admirals and advanced by seniority. Except for a moment in 1722 when he was appointed to take a squadron to Lisbon (the mission was cancelled), he did not hoist his flag until 1726.<br>
<br>Wager then began a period of intensive sea service. He commanded a large battle fleet sent to the Baltic to protect Sweden and Denmark from the threat of a recently mobilized Russian fleet. Stopping first at Copenhagen, he met with the court and completed arrangements for co-operation with the Danish navy. His report of 30 April 1726 evoked a glowing response from the secretary of state, Viscount Townshend:<blockquote>his Majesty has commanded me to let you know from Him, that he was before persuaded you was a very good Admiral, but he now sees that you are likewise an able Minister. All the answers you gave to the questions proposed to you at the Conference with the Danish Council were extremely right. (TNA: PRO, SP 42/81, fol. 47)</blockquote>After calling on the Swedish court, Wager took his twenty ships of the line to Reval. He had orders to engage and destroy the Russian fleet if it came out. A frustrated and angry tsarina felt compelled to demobilize it instead. To reassure Sweden the British fleet stayed at Reval all summer, losing many men to sickness, and did not enter the Thames until 1 November.<br>
<br>Within less than two months Wager was ordered back to sea; his destination was Gibraltar, against which the Spanish were preparing a siege. He arrived on 2 February 1727 with six ships of the line, two cruisers, two bomb-vessels, and additional troops for the garrison. The fleet helped cover the land approaches (Wager ordered two frigates and a bomb-vessel to &#145;the back of the Hill&#146;) and ensured resupply. Britain and Spain were undoubtedly at war. At one point in early May there was a furious artillery exchange, but usually the actions were cautious and desultory. It was chiefly a naval war, with prizes taken. The main burden was borne by Francis Hosier's fleet in the Caribbean, which suffered losses to tropical disease while successfully accomplishing its mission of preventing the galleons from leaving Cartagena. The Spanish king, destitute of the silver needed for his diplomatic commitments, agreed to a cessation of arms in mid-June, but gave no indication of actually yielding. Finally, in early March 1728, Spain agreed to a convention and Wager's fleet could be ordered home; he arrived on 9 April after sixteen months abroad.<br>
<br>Wager resumed his regular attendance at the Admiralty board, but in May 1729 he was ordered to take command of thirty-three ships, which were soon joined by fourteen Dutch. This huge squadron never left Spithead and was popularly ridiculed as the &#145;stay-at-home fleet&#146;. It was assembled because the court of Spain was acting as if the convention meant nothing and France, though an ally in this matter, was doing nothing about it. Parliament was dangerously impatient. The fleet remained in readiness until it was learned that Spain would sign a firm treaty.<br>
<br>Wager's next and last deployment as a fleet commander arose from provisions of that treaty (signed at Seville on 9 November 1729). It confirmed the Spanish queen's title to certain parts of Italy, which she assigned to her son, Don Carlos; a right to install Spanish garrisons was also obtained. It seemed advisable to have a strong British fleet alongside the Spanish when the troops were to be landed at Leghorn. With Wager's flag in the <i>Namur</i> (90 guns), the British fleet entered Cadiz Bay on 1 August 1731, and after many grand entertainments and reciprocating invitations, moved into the Mediterranean. The mission at Leghorn was accomplished without incident but only after much delay, so Wager did not get back to England until 10 December 1731. Upon arrival he reported his sense of &#145;pleasure to have a success where doubtful&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 42/82, fol. 395). Thus, for one brief moment this man who had blasted and captured galleons, whose thoughts had been and would continue to be focused on strategies for crushing the Spaniards, had done them good service, with cordiality reigning on both sides.<br>
<br>Between April 1726 and December 1731 Wager had spent as many months flying his flag as he spent ashore. The missions he was asked to execute all involved diplomatic discretion as well as strategic acumen. In 1732, in a letter to a Gloucestershire acquaintance from the Admiralty office, he remarked that for many years he had been inclined to retire. &#145;But&#146;, he continued,<blockquote>I have been sent on several expeditions (not by my own choice), wherein I have succeeded so well, as to have the King's approbation, and very like may be put, in case of a Vacancy, at the head of this Board. (<span class="italic">Gloucestershire Notes and Queries</span>, 1, 1881, 120)</blockquote>Evidently he believed that his elevation, if it occurred, would stem from his successes as a fleet commander and diplomat, not his long experience in naval administration.<h2>
<a name="Firstlord17331742"></a>First lord, 1733&#150;1742</h2>When Lord Torrington died in January 1733, Under-Secretary Delafaye reported to a colleague: &#145;Every body looks upon Sir Charles Wager as the person who will now be at the head of the affairs of the navy; as indeed I may say he has been for some time&#146;  (Coxe, 3.128). It seems that Wager's administrative knowledge and talent did matter. The official appointment as first lord was dated 21 June 1733. He was popular enough to be nominated and elected MP for Westminster in 1734.<br>
<br>Besides administrative capacity, Wager brought some important assets to the office. His character as a trusted senior admiral tended to subdue the incipient factions of the officer corps. The most prominent example of his candid professionalism was the strong plea he made to the leading ministers in December 1738 that Edward Vernon should be given the West Indies command, notwithstanding his unrelenting opposition in parliament. Wager was also a &#145;Parliament man&#146;, as he described himself to Sir Robert Walpole  (Cholmondeley [Houghton] MS, 1881). In him Walpole had a staunchly loyal (they were personal friends as well as closely co-operating ministers of state) spokesman in the House of Commons who was well liked, well informed, and widely trusted; it was an advantage that Wager was not made a peer. Finally, no other first lord of the eighteenth century had so comprehensive a knowledge of maritime geography, seaborne commerce, and colonial circumstances. It seems that when anyone in government needed an opinion touching these subjects Wager was asked. Many of his responses, most of them written in his own hand, have survived (Vernon&#150;Wager MSS); he was, in effect, a one-man bureau of maritime intelligence.<br>
<br>Wager's reputation has suffered from a profoundly mistaken idea that the navy was then at a low ebb. In reality its numerical preponderance over other navies was greater than at any other time in the century, and its dockyard facilities, overseas bases (Wager was much involved in the development of new bases in the Caribbean), victualling organization, and central co-ordination were by far the most elaborate and advanced. Although British warship design was inferior to French in some respects, the real problem was an insufficiency of the versatile and seaworthy 60-gun ships, a class that Wager's Admiralty had chosen to augment during the 1730s but, as wartime experience would show, not aggressively enough.<br>
<br>The great unsolved problem was manning. In May 1731 Wager had remarked:<blockquote>we have no difficulty but in getting men; &hellip; our Country being such a free Country, that every man does what he pleases: by reason of which, this Nation will be lossd [<i>sic</i>] one time or other, if it wont admit of a remedy. (TNA: PRO, SP 42/82, fol. 137)</blockquote>Upon the outbreak of war the problem rapidly grew severe, and Wager, strongly encouraged by Admiral Sir John Norris, pressed for legislative measures; the government introduced bills to facilitate naval manning and Walpole supported them, but parliament would not pass anything meaningful.<br>
<br>The strategy for defeating Spain, insisted upon by the duke of Newcastle, called for capturing a major objective in the West Indies, and thus a large fleet and army had to be sent to a region where tropical diseases were rife. Wager was not confident; he feared complications, and well knew the price of delay in that climate. He preferred strategies that could frustrate Spanish silver shipments while employing smaller forces. His favourite was to threaten the Peruvian coast from the &#145;South Sea&#146;. The famous voyage of Commodore George Anson, who sailed from England in 1740, was a result of Wager's advocacy.<br>
<br>The assault on Cartagena failed mainly because the forces succumbed to disease. Even before the expedition left England disease took its toll; the typhus epidemic of 1740&#151;the worst of the century&#151;ravaged newly recruited seamen and spread through the fleet, seriously aggravating the manning problem and delaying departure. The profound disappointment of a public that had never doubted success was played upon by the fervid opposition to Walpole, and eventually (though not in the eighteenth century) Wager's reputation was injured.<br>
<br>Claims that Wager had grown too old for his responsibilities can neither be proved nor disproved, but may be doubted. A captain who attended the great debate of 13 February 1741 on whether to petition the king to remove Walpole from office observed: &#145;Sir Charles Wager is as Hearty as I ever knew Him, spoke in the motion &hellip; at four in the morning, tho He had been there from seven the morning before&#146;. On that occasion Wager issued a challenge, saying that if there were any mismanagements &#145;in the Office of Admiralty, He &amp; the rest of the Board ought to answer it at their own peril, &amp; not Sir Robert&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2529, fol. 122). He was fit enough to command the king's channel crossings in 1740 and 1741. (Wager's decision to turn back to Holland on a stormy night in December 1736 had probably saved the whole entourage.) Rumours that he was inattentive may be offset by his record of steady attendance at the board, cabinet meetings, in parliament, and by much else.<br>
<br>The king's insistence on having Wager see him across the water in May 1741 was unfortunate politically because the voyage coincided with the Westminster election. Wager was still popular and his presence during the polling might have prevented the surprise nomination of Edward Vernon (who, in the West Indies, knew nothing about it and later apologized to Wager). As it happened the bailiff pre-emptively closed the poll, thus provoking a riot and inviting a challenge. The fiasco, which culminated in a voiding of the election on a very close vote in the House of Commons, contributed notably to Walpole's loss of parliamentary control. The year 1741 also witnessed some key strategic failures and in January 1742 Wager offered to resign as first lord. The king refused, but very soon after (11 February) his resignation was accepted when it became clear that Walpole was arranging to leave office.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearandcharacter"></a>Final year and character</h2>In December 1742 Wager was appointed treasurer of the navy, a handsome sinecure which served as a pension. He remained in parliament, having been elected for West Looe. He was reportedly living at Stanley House, Chelsea, when he died, peacefully, on 24 May 1743. Francis Gashry, long his right-hand man of business, arranged the monument in Westminster Abbey, and he was buried in the north cross of the abbey on 30 May. His chief heir was Charles Bolton, son of his sister, Prudence. His widow, Martha, was executor. They had no children, but numerous relatives, many stemming from his half-sisters, all of whom he is said to have helped financially or by appropriate patronage recommendations. Yet Wager was also known for spreading his generosity very widely, to individuals in need as well as philanthropic organizations.<br>
<br>When Wager died Horace Walpole observed that he had &#145;left the fairest character&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 2.245&#150;6), a judgement supported by every scrap of surviving evidence. A remembrance recorded many years later by Arthur Onslow, the respected speaker of the Commons, remains highly instructive:<blockquote>He was of the most gentle and humane disposition I ever knew, and spent almost the whole he got in generous acts of charity and compassion. I had a long and intimate acquaintance with him, and have seen where his temper has been tried by much provocation, but I never saw him discomposed. He had a very good understanding, great plainness of manners, and a steadiness of courage that no danger could daunt, with the same calmness in it that he shewed in the most ordinary acts of his life. He was indeed a person of most extraordinary worth, and the world bore him a respect that was due to it. His father was a captain of a man of war before the restoration, and very likely after that: but dying when this son was young, and the mother marrying a Quaker, he was bred up among that people; by which he acquired the simplicity of his manners, and had much of their fashion in his speech as well as carriage. And all this, with his particular roughness of countenance, made the softness of his nature still more pleasing, because unexpected at first. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 5.390)</blockquote>Lady Wager died on 7 April 1748 and was buried next to him, in the north cross of Westminster Abbey.<br>
