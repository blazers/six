<span class="headword">Bywaters,  Eric George Lapthorne</span>  (1910&#150;2003), <span class="occ">rheumatologist</span>, was born on 1 June 1910 at 11 Kingly Street, Westminster, the son of George Ernest Bywaters (1878&#150;1966), director of a building company, and his wife, Ethel Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Penney (1879&#150;1942). His early education was at Southsea preparatory school. He then won a scholarship to the Sutton Valence School in Kent, where his biology teacher interested him in collecting and making detailed drawings of rotifers, the microscopic free-swimming transparent animals with eyes, stomach, and genitalia that live in puddles and streams. This interest in biology steered him to a career in medicine. He qualified from the Middlesex Hospital medical school in 1933 with a gold medal and honours in pathology. He was then appointed as assistant pathologist to Lionel Whitby. On 10 August 1935 he married Betty Mereryd Euan-Thomas (1909&#150;1998), physiotherapist, and daughter of William Edward Euan-Thomas, tea merchant. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>While researching on cartilage with Charles Dodds at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry at the Middlesex Hospital, Bywaters came to the notice of Walter Bauer, a pioneer of rheumatology in the USA, who invited him in 1937 to Harvard and the Massachusetts General Hospital. There he studied patients with <i>Lupus erythematosus</i>, his wife, Betty, doing the follow-ups. In 1939, when the Second World War was imminent, they returned to London, but Bywaters was rejected for military service because of a kidney problem. He took over the rheumatism clinic at the British Postgraduate Medical School in Hammersmith Hospital, setting up a study of the life history and clinical outcome in 200 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. When the bombing of London started, he studied casualties whose limbs had been trapped by falling masonry and who after rescue developed fatal kidney failure, a sequence that became known as &#145;crush syndrome&#146;. In 1944 this work moved to Newcastle at the Medical Research Council shock research unit. The cause of crush syndrome, he found, was the release into the bloodstream from damaged muscle of the muscle protein, myoglobin. This blocked the tiny ducts in the kidneys so that urine and waste products could not be filtered from the blood. Bywaters used animal models to show that alkaline fluids by mouth or intravenously, if given in time, could keep the patient alive until the kidneys could heal. He was the first to introduce the Kolff artificial kidney to the UK for those with established kidney damage.<br>
<br>Before the war rheumatology was not a recognized speciality of medicine. Indeed many teaching hospital physicians regarded arthritis patients as &#145;bed-blockers&#146; who could neither be cured nor discharged from hospital. Such patients were referred to the physical medicine departments of hospitals, to spa hospitals, or in London to outpatient clinics established by the Red Cross. Some consultants who believed in the theory of focal sepsis as the cause of rheumatic conditions injected patients with vaccines made from their own resident bacteria, a treatment that persisted long after its value was debunked. It fell to Bywaters and a few of his contemporaries to change these attitudes and practices.<br>
<br>In 1947 Bywaters had taken on the additional responsibility of director of the special unit for juvenile rheumatism at Taplow, near Maidenhead. The unit, housed in a small general hospital (formerly a military hospital) built on part of the Cliveden estate, comprised three thirty-bed wards, offices, and research laboratories. There was meticulous follow-up of the patients organized through outreach clinics at Slough, Isleworth, Reading, Hammersmith, and the National Heart Hospital. When the seemingly miraculous effects of cortisone on arthritis in adults were described by Philip Hench and Edward Kendall in 1948, the special unit took part in a combined US&#150;UK study of the effects of the hormone in rheumatic fever children. Though the immediate and dramatic effects of cortisone on their painful inflamed joints were confirmed, after five years it was proven, disappointingly, that cortisone did not protect the heart from rheumatic heart disease. Nevertheless the introduction of powerful antibiotics and the general increase in post-war public hygiene were able to prevent and cure the streptococcal infections that triggered rheumatic fever, so that by 1960 new admissions for rheumatic fever were a rarity. The clientele of the special unit changed from rheumatic fever to juvenile forms of chronic arthritis, previously known as Still's disease.<br>
<br>Bywaters's forte was in his expertise in pathology and in his visual approach to the rheumatic diseases. He explored these from the clinical to the ultramicroscopic level, often enlisting new methods of imaging to make a research point or a more telling teaching slide. He left to others in his team the molecular intimacies of auto-immunity, which most rheumatologists came to accept as the most likely cause of the inflammatory rheumatic diseases. He used his skill in pathology to clear up ambiguities of diagnosis, firmly differentiating rheumatic fever from rheumatoid arthritis at tissue level. He was consulted by others for his expertise in the morbid anatomy and tissue pathology of the rheumatic diseases. He was also a pioneer in the study of bone diseases, introducing an early method of quantifying osteoporosis and showing how other bone conditions could affect joints. At Hammersmith he continued his survey of 200 patients with rheumatoid arthritis seen early in their disease and followed them for twenty years, a study that yielded a wealth of material and became the basis for numerous studies of the natural history of the disease and the causes of death. He received the prestigious Gairdner award in 1968.<br>
<br>Bywaters's most noteworthy achievement was his pioneering work on juvenile chronic arthritis. With his colleagues but particularly with Barbara Ansell he transformed the management of these children. Whereas at one time they would be put to bed for long periods, their muscles wasting, their limbs stiffening in the position they were nursed in bed, it was Bywaters's policy to use pain control with drugs and hydrotherapy and if necessary surgery in order to maintain or regain movement. Much of the work was of a &#145;salvage&#146; nature in neglected children. His surgeon colleagues were the first to develop custom-made artificial hips for children. Other prosthetic joints followed. Inflammation of the eyes caused by the disease could lead to cataracts and blindness: ophthalmologists at Taplow found ways to counter this. Dentists had to devise ways of getting stiffened jaws to open and anaesthetists ways of administering anaesthetics to children with stiff necks. The body of expertise built up at Taplow spread out to the country as a whole. Based on the work at Taplow, paediatric rheumatology became a recognized speciality of its own.<br>
<br>Bywaters was also notable for &#145;seeding&#146; rheumatologists and rheumatology expertise throughout the world. Postgraduate students came to Hammersmith and Taplow in large numbers not only from the United Kingdom but from the Commonwealth and Europe. Some became professors in their own universities, spreading knowledge wider. Bywaters counted 349 trainees over his period of service and he was later able to visit many of them in their own countries and universities. He was also proud of his contribution in bringing the medical perception of rheumatology firmly into the orbit of general medicine. His work was honoured in many countries, and after his retirement he was particularly glad to receive the European League against Rheumatism's award for lifetime achievement.<br>
<br>Bywaters was an avid medical historian, amassing a lifetime's collection of books and artefacts related in particular to the history of rheumatic diseases, much of which he donated to the libraries of the Wellcome Institute and the Royal College of Physicians. He started painting in watercolours during the First World War when he was evacuated to Southsea. Oil painting was begun later and he became a skilled portrait artist. He went into caricature as a medical student when he was editor of the hospital magazine (tolerated, usually, by his teachers), and regularly caricatured himself and family in annual Christmas cards. He was also a keen gardener and a member of the Royal Horticultural Society. He was particularly proud of his rare union jack dahlia, which had been acquired as a tuber from Eleanor Singer, to whose house in Suffolk his wife and family had been evacuated towards the end of the Second World War. In his Beaconsfield garden there also stood a <i>Platanus orientalis</i> that he grew from a seed from the original plane tree under which Hippocrates is said to have taught. After his wife Betty died in 1998 he found the garden a great consolation. His final weeks were spent in a nursing home, Chalfont Lodge, in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. He died there on 2 April 2003 of bronchopneumonia and cerebrovascular disease, and was survived by his three daughters.<br>
