<span class="headword">Zouch,  Henry</span>  (1725?&#150;1795), <span class="occ">magistrate and writer on the poor</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Charles Zouch (<i>d</i>. 1754), the vicar of Sandal Magna, near Wakefield, Yorkshire, and Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Norton (1695/6&#150;1760); he was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30299/', "Thomas Zouch")</script>. Henry was educated at Wakefield School and was admitted as pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1743, where he graduated BA in 1746 and MA in 1750. In 1754 he took over his father's old parish of Sandal Magna, where he served as vicar until 1789. He was also rector for the parishes of Swillington and Tankersley and chaplain to the marchioness of Rockingham. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1796), the daughter and heir of William Spinke of Wakefield, but they remained childless.<br>
<br>A minor poet, scholar, and keen antiquarian, Zouch is best known for his work as a social reformer. He was a long-serving active magistrate and chairman of the quarter sessions in the West Riding of Yorkshire. From this experience stemmed his interest in the reform of the poor laws, the administration of justice, and, especially, the improvement of the manners and morals of the common people. The West Riding of Yorkshire in the late eighteenth century was ill-famed for its robust and independent plebeian culture. To this Zouch reacted with concern and great reforming zeal, but rather less sympathy and understanding of the significance of the customary culture of the poor. Traditional customs of the manufacturing districts included dog-fighting, street-football, and the holding of riotous wakes and village fairs. The godly complained of disruption to the sabbath while manufacturers bemoaned lost days of work. Zouch saw all these things as breeding grounds for crime, vice, and immorality and, along with others of his generation, he sought to regenerate the old campaign for the reformation of manners. He promoted Sunday schools to instil good habits in the young, called for the suppression of village feasts, and urged magistrates and other authority figures to take a more active role in the superintendence of their subordinates. He was also concerned at what appeared to be a crime wave following a rash of poaching and nocturnal crime. Making a strong connection between crime and poverty, immorality and vice, he battled against unlicensed drinking houses, brothels, and other unofficial meeting-places. His dislike of popular entertainments and suspicion of theatrical and musical performances went even so far as proscribing the performance of oratorios in church.<br>
<br>In the 1780s a broad-based national movement of like-minded contemporaries emerged to combat vice among the lower orders, and Zouch was to play a leading role as an organizer and as a publicist. Next to William Wilberforce, Zouch emerged as a key figure in the Proclamation Society (the Society for the Suppression of Vice and Prophaneness), which set out to enforce royal proclamations against vice and immorality dating from the 1690s. This movement agitated outside of the church for a general reformation of conduct among the high and the low by setting worthy examples of leadership and moral seriousness. Zouch was the West Riding delegate to the national convention of magistrates that met in London in 1790 to confer with the Proclamation Society on the best means to improve police and prisons. A follower of John Howard on penal reform, Zouch reorganized the county gaol at Wakefield and sought to improve the administration of justice by example and precept. Although he was not an original thinker, his written works reached a wide audience and carried some influence. These combined an interest in the Enlightenment battle to reform and modernize criminal justice, along with respect for the ancient tradition of English law. His <span class="italic">Hints Respecting the Public Police</span> (1786) made ten recommendations ranging from the formation of private associations for the prosecution of felons to the promotion of Sunday schools. Henry Zouch died on 17 June 1795 and was buried in his garden at Sandal on 21 June, a final wish that sealed his reputation for eccentricity. His wife died in the following year.<br>
