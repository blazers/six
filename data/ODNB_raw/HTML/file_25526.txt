<span class="headword">Sidney <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Solomon]</span>,  Samuel</span>  (1813&#150;1883), <span class="occ">writer on agriculture</span>, was born on 6 February 1813 in Paradise Street, Birmingham, where his father, Abraham Solomon MD, practised as a physician. He was educated for the law, and acted for a short time (about 1834) as a solicitor in Liverpool. He soon took, however, to journalistic and literary work, using the <i>nom de plume</i> of Sidney, which he afterwards adopted for all purposes. His earlier writings dealt largely with railways and the gauge question and attacked Isambard Kingdom Brunel and the Great Western Company. Most of his works on this subject appeared between 1846 and 1848, notably pamphlets on the gauge controversy and his <span class="italic">Railways and Agriculture in North Lincolnshire</span> (1848), which suggested the benefits of railways in the era of &#145;high farming&#146; following the repeal of the corn laws. He followed this with an account of <span class="italic">Rides on Railways</span> (1851) to the scenic regions of the Lake District, north Wales, and Derbyshire dales. In 1847 the return of his brother John from Australia appears to have aroused Sidney's interest in the colonies, and he wrote much on emigration and colonization between 1848 and 1854. In collaboration with his brother he edited <span class="italic">Sidney's Emigrant's Journal</span> between 1848 and 1850, when it was discontinued &#145;as barely paying its necessary expenses&#146;. From 1847 to 1857 he wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, acting as hunting correspondent, and visiting agricultural exhibitions in Britain and abroad. He wrote also for the <span class="italic">Live Stock Journal</span> a series of articles extending over many years entitled &#145;Horse chat&#146; and signed Cavalier. He contributed many articles to the earlier volumes of <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, and wrote a novel dealing with Australian life, entitled <span class="italic">Gallops and Gossips in the Bush of Australia</span> (1854), which he dedicated to Charles Dickens.<br>
<br>In 1850&#150;51 Sidney became one of the assistant commissioners for the Great Exhibition, and was afterwards for some years assistant secretary to the Crystal Palace Company. In 1859 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the secretaryship of the Royal Agricultural Society, and in the following year he became secretary of the Agricultural Hall Company. In 1864 he organized the first horse show held at that hall, and he later acted as manager of many succeeding horse shows there.<br>
<br>In 1857 Sidney edited and in great part rewrote W. C. L. Martin's book <span class="italic">The Pig</span>; and in 1860 he re-edited William Youatt's book of the same title. But by far his most important contribution to literature was <span class="italic">The Book of the Horse</span>, for which he had long collected materials and which was first published in 1873. It is a mine of information on the various breeds of horses, British and foreign, on fox-hunting and deer-hunting, on horsemanship and horsewomanship, on the management of the stable, breeding, breaking, and so on. It is in this work that Sidney's versatile pen appears at its best. The book became popular at once, and was reissued five times up to 1898. In its compilation he had valuable assistance from many leading experts, but he was himself a good judge of a horse, and was a fine rider in his early days. His wife, Marie, was a journalist. He died of heart disease at his home, 10 Bethune Road, Stamford Hill, London, on 8 June 1883, and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
