<span class="headword">Binning,  Hugh</span>  (1627&#150;1653), <span class="occ">philosopher and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Dalvenan, Ayrshire, the son of John Binning, the proprietor of Dalvenan, and Margaret M'Kell, daughter of Matthew M'Kell (or M'Kail), the parish clergyman of Bothwell, Lanarkshire. Margaret M'Kell's brother Hugh M'Kail, a minister in Edinburgh, was the uncle of Hugh M'Kail, a presbyterian minister, who was imprisoned, tortured, and finally hanged at Edinburgh on 22 December 1666 for his participation in the Pentland rising. Binning's father had inherited the considerable landed estate of Dalvenan and Hugh was given a liberal education. At thirteen he entered the University of Glasgow, to study philosophy. His professors there (who included James Dalrymple, later Viscount Stair) were quickly impressed by Binning's extensive knowledge and philosophical acumen and he took his degree of MA &#145;with much applause&#146; on 27 July 1646  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. Leishman, 2nd edn, xxxvi). He then began to study divinity, &#145;with a view to serve God in the holy ministry&#146;  (Howie, 202). However, when James Dalrymple subsequently resigned his post as regent at Glasgow, Binning was strongly encouraged by the Glasgow presbytery to apply for the chair. As was customary at the time, all the members of the universities in the kingdom who had &#145;a mind to the profession of philosophy&#146; were invited to &#145;sist&#146; themselves before the senatus to &#145;compete for the preferment&#146;  (ibid.). Binning and two other candidates were selected for &#145;trials&#146;, in the light of which the college masters favoured Binning. However, the university principal, Dr John Strang, preferred one of the other candidates&#151;&#145;a citizen's son&#146; of competent learning and a person of &#145;more years&#146; than Binning  (ibid., 203). But when a member of faculty suggested an extempore public debate between the two candidates&#151;&#145;upon any subject [the masters] should be pleased to prescribe&#146;&#151;Binning's opponent immediately withdrew, he and his supporters being unwilling to face &#145;such an able antagonist&#146;  (ibid.). Thus, in November 1646, aged only eighteen, Binning was elected regent in philosophy at the University of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Despite his having very little time for preparation, Binning's lectures were by all accounts extremely well received. Famously, he is described as being among the first to try to rescue philosophy in Scotland from the &#145;barbarous terms and unintelligible jargon of the schoolmen&#146;  (Howie, 203). As a preacher he followed Luther's maxim &#145;they are the best preachers to the people, who teach them in a plain, familiar and perfectly simple way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. Leishman, 2nd edn, xxx). Moreover, Binning's justification for his pedagogy was not merely pragmatic: &#145;Ye should remember that the Lord speaks in our terms, and, like nurses with their children, uses our own dialect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. Leishman, 3rd edn, 74).<br>
<br>For Binning, philosophy was the servant of theology. Hence it is reasonable to anticipate a parallel pedagogy at work in his philosophical teaching. This places Binning at the forefront of a distinctive tradition at Glasgow subsequently extended in the teaching of Francis Hutcheson and culminating in Adam Smith's lectures on rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i>. He held his post with increasing influence for about three years. At the same time he continued to pursue his theological studies, and having obtained a licence as a minister he received a call to the parish of Govan near Glasgow on 25 October 1649. On 8 January following he was ordained at Govan; he resigned his professorship the following year. In 1650 he married Mary or Maria Simpson (<i>d</i>. 1694) (sometimes erroneously given as Barbara), daughter of the Revd James Simpson, the parish minister of Airth in Stirlingshire (who has been wrongly described as an Irish minister). They had one son. Binning continued his philosophical and theological studies, but also devoted himself to his sermons and pastoral duties, with considerable success. As a preacher he regularly attracted vast crowds. When (in 1651) the church found itself split into resolutioners (who supported the king) and protesters (who opposed him), Binning sided with the latter. He then wrote and published his <span class="italic">Treatise on Christian Love</span>&#151;a moving and compelling plea to Christians to overcome their differences and unite in the love of God and fellowship with one another. The <span class="italic">Treatise</span> was highly regarded by his contemporaries and continues to be so. Binning is said to have played a prominent part in the open debate before Cromwell at Glasgow in April 1651 between the independents and presbyterians. His intellect, eloquence, and extensive knowledge of theology made him a formidable opponent in debate. A contemporary, James Durham, professor of divinity at Glasgow, famously observed &#145;that there was no speaking after Mr Binning&#146;  (Howie, 206). On this occasion his success in debate is said to have so embarrassed Cromwell's party of independents that Cromwell himself asked the name &#145;of that learned and bold young man&#146;, and when told it was Binning, Cromwell replied, &#145;He hath bound well indeed, but&#146; (putting his hand on his sword) &#145;this will loose all again&#146;  (ibid., 205).<br>
<br>That a debate before Cromwell took place at Glasgow is certain, but the precise nature of that debate cannot be conclusively established. While there is no record of the specific content of Binning's arguments on this occasion, his stance on matters political and theological was invariably pacifying and conciliatory. Indeed the use of theological and philosophical arguments to transcend the disputes and divisions of his time is definitive of Binning's work and is well exemplified both in the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> and the later <span class="italic">Heart-Humiliation</span>. Despite being plagued by ill health throughout his short life he was a prolific author. In addition to the texts cited above he composed several other works, including collections of lectures, sermons, and essays on the theological controversies definitive of his time. His writing is informed by his knowledge of philosophy and theology but also shows a genuine concern to communicate effectively with a non-academic audience. Though none of his works were published in his lifetime the majority were published posthumously. His <span class="italic">Collected Works</span> exists in three editions in English and his writings were also translated into Dutch by James Coleman&#151;a minister at Sluys in Flanders&#151;and subsequently published at Amsterdam in at least four editions.<br>
<br>Binning died of consumption at Govan in September 1653 and was buried in his churchyard there. His son, John, inherited the estate of Dalvenan on his grandfather's death. His part in the insurrection at Bothwell Bridge in 1679 resulted in the forfeiture of the estate and, ultimately, insolvency. In 1690 parliament rescinded forfeitures and fines for the period 1665&#150;88, but Dalvenan was not restored to John Binning. In 1704, having obtained a patent, John Binning successfully applied to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland for approval of a single-volume edition of his father's writings.<br>
