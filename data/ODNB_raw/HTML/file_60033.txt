<span class="headword">Otway, Sir  Loftus William</span>  (1775&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 28 April 1775, the fourth son of the six children of Cooke Otway (<i>d</i>. December 1800), captain of horse, of Castle Otway, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1807), daughter of Samuel Waller of Lisbrian, co. Tipperary. Otway had three older brothers&#151;Henry (<i>d</i>. 1815), Robert Waller 
    (later Admiral Sir Robert; 1772&#150;1846)
  , and Samuel Jocelyn (<i>d</i>. 1855), in holy orders&#151;one younger brother, George (<i>d</i>. 1804), an infantry major, and a sister, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1802). He joined the 5th dragoon guards as a cornet on 17 May 1796, and advanced to lieutenant on 2 September. Possibly he went to Ireland with the regiment in October; he was present during the defeat of rebels at Vinegar Hill on 21 June 1798. He became a captain on 27 October 1798, and obtained a majority on 24 February 1803, before transferring to the 8th light dragoons on 14 July 1804. Otway seems to have served as deputy adjutant-general in Canada at about this time. On 28 March 1805 he went on Irish half pay as lieutenant-colonel. Retaining that army rank, he obtained a majority in the 18th light dragoons on 12 February 1807.<br>
<br>Otway embarked with the regiment for Portugal in July 1808, but saw no action before peace the following month. The 18th light dragoons remained in the Peninsula with Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore's army which marched into Spain to confront the French. Heavily outnumbered, Moore ordered retirement northwards towards Corunna on 5 December 1808, Otway's regiment forming part of the rearguard. On 12 December 1808, in a night attack at Rueda, Otway distinguished himself by capturing &#145;the whole of the French Cavalry out-lying picquet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Army List</span>, 1840). Shortly afterwards near Valladolid he overwhelmed a strong French force, taking its colonel &#145;and more of his Chasseurs than he had dragoons to guard them, and brought them all into headquarters, horses, men, arms and baggage&#146;  (ibid.). Otway then led the regiment in the absence of its commanding officer in successful skirmishes at Sahagun. When it faced a superior enemy force at Benevente on 27 December the regiment held off six squadrons of the imperial guard for almost an hour, after which Otway's outlying picket captured a general and 150 prisoners.<br>
<br>The 18th light dragoons reached Corunna on 16 January 1809 and the regiment was back in England by 8 February, where it stayed for four years. However, Otway returned to the Peninsula to command a cavalry brigade in Marshal William Carr Beresford's Portuguese army, and fought at Busaco on 27 September 1810. When Beresford advanced on Badajoz, at Campo Mayor on 25 March 1811 Otway captured over 500 men and sixteen guns, but vigorous enemy counter-attacks restricted him to sixteen prisoners and one tumbril. During the subsequent withdrawal towards Lisbon his cavalry protected Beresford's left flank at Albuera on 16 May 1811, a day after formally going on English half pay. His proposal to raise a unit of lancers from non-French prisoners of war was rejected by the Horse Guards in London during September 1812. Otway remained in the Peninsula until 1814, almost certainly training Portuguese recruits. He advanced to colonel in the British army on 4 June 1813, was knighted by the prince regent on 15 January 1815, appointed CB on 4 June 1815, and, in 1822, made a knight of the order of Charles III of Spain. He had married Frances, only daughter of Sir Charles Blicke of Caroon Park, Surrey; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Otway received the military general service medal with three clasps for Sahagun and Benevente, Busaco, and Albuera. He was promoted major-general on 12 August 1819 and lieutenant-general on 10 January 1837, and was colonel of the 84th foot from 30 December 1840 until his death. He was promoted general on 11 November 1851. Otway died at his residence, 13 Grosvenor Square, London, on 7 June 1854, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. His son, Loftus Charles (1815&#150;1861), diplomat, was minister-plenipotentiary to Mexico (1858&#150;9) and consul-general at Milan (1860&#150;1).<br>
