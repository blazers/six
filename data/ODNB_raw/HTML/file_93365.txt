<span class="headword">Curzon, Sir  Nathaniel</span>, fourth baronet  (1675/6&#150;1758), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was the second of the five sons of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, second baronet (1636&#150;1719), and his wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1655&#150;1728), daughter of William Penn of Penn, Buckinghamshire. The Curzons, originally from Normandy, had been resident in Derbyshire at Kedleston since the twelfth century, and by the early eighteenth century had come to enjoy a pre-eminence among the county grandees, second only to the dukes of Devonshire in wealth and political influence. Curzon's grandfather, Sir John Curzon (1598&#150;1686), had been created first a Scottish then an English baronet by Charles I, while his father, having three elder brothers, had pursued a successful mercantile career in London before inheriting the title and family estates in 1686.<br>
<br>Like his elder brother John, Nathaniel was sent to Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated aged sixteen on 2 July 1692, before enrolling in 1694 as a student at the Inner Temple, and finally qualifying as a barrister in 1700. His younger brother William qualified in 1705, while another brother, Charles, went on to become a civil lawyer. Curzon spent much of the next decade or so building up a successful legal practice in London, which he continued to maintain after being elected as tory MP for Derby in April 1713. In the Commons, where he joined his elder brother, who had sat as one of Derby's knights of the shire since 1701, he supported the earl of Oxford's ministry, though he had not been uncritical of the recently concluded peace terms. He lost his seat in the general election of 1715.<br>
<br>On 19 February 1717, at Middleton, Lancashire, Curzon married Mary (1694/5&#150;1776), one of the three daughters and coheirs of Sir Ralph Assheton, second baronet (1652&#150;1716), of Middleton, and with her subsequently had three sons, one of whom died young, and two daughters. The marriage also brought him a large share of the Whalley Abbey estate situated near Clitheroe in Lancashire, and by 1722 he had purchased a sufficient number of burgages in the borough to win one of its two parliamentary seats in the election of that year. Curzon's elder brother John, who had become third baronet in 1719, died unmarried in August 1727 a few weeks after sustaining a fall from his horse while out hunting when one of his spurs punctured his boot and caused a fatal gangrenous wound. Curzon succeeded to the title, adding an estate of &pound;10,000 per annum to the considerable estate he had already amassed through the profits of his legal practice and marriage into the Assheton fortune. Weeks later he also took his brother's place as knight of the shire in the general election and was to retain the seat without interruption until his eventual retirement.<br>
<br>Curzon now shared a position at the apex of Derbyshire society with the ducal Cavendishes of Chatsworth. His country seat, Kedleston Hall, was a handsome redbrick mansion commissioned by his father and finished about 1700, the state apartments &#145;extremely well furnished and magnificent, adorned with good paintings of great Italian masters, as Carolo Lutti, Paul Veronese, etc.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.299). His landed wealth included extensive collieries in Derbyshire, as well as much prime property in Westminster, among which was his fashionable new town house in Queen Square, Bloomsbury. Curzon was soon seeking to aggrandize his social position with a peerage, though his record as a tory opponent of whig rule precluded any possibility of his entering the upper house through political favour. In 1729 he sued for a writ of summons to the House of Lords as Lord Grey of Powis on the basis of his family's claim to the barony, but in so doing activated a rival claim from the Kynastons of Shropshire. The case opened in the House of Lords in March 1731 but soon became hopelessly bogged down amid serious doubts about the adequacy of the heralds' records as the chief authority for substantiating or invalidating testimony heard in peerage claims. Curzon's case suffered from not having the backing of John Anstis, Garter king of arms and the senior officer of the heralds' college, who supported the rival claimant, John Kynaston. The proceedings lapsed in 1732, though the Curzon family's pretensions to ennoblement did not diminish.<br>
<br>Although Curzon was always identified as a member of the large anti-government tory bloc in the House of Commons he was nevertheless an unconventional tory, being one of a small handful who occasionally voted with the government. In Curzon's case this tendency to distance himself openly from his tory confr&egrave;res during the late 1720s and early 1730s may have been part of a personal strategy to improve his chances of securing the Grey of Powis barony. His active promotion of two controversial, and ultimately unsuccessful, bills in March and April 1733 to reform the ecclesiastical courts, a direct assault on the institutions of the Church of England, was certainly out of character for a tory, but his bold stand marked him as one of a small number of anti-clerical tories who were critical of the monopolization of the church's jurisdictional functions by an exclusively whig hierarchy.<br>
<br>Much of Curzon's activity in the house was consonant with his professional background as a barrister. There is no record of his ever participating in debate; instead his spokesmanship was confined to the routines of minor legislative business, much of it parochial or private and relating to Derbyshire. More significantly, however, and as the pages of the Commons' journal reveal, he made himself one of the most active and useful committee participants in the house. Session after session he was nominated to a large number of the select committees appointed to scrutinize petitions and bills, an area of Commons business where his grasp of legal and procedural technicality was evidently in particular demand.<br>
<br>During the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, in which the rebel forces pressed as far south as Derby, Curzon subscribed to the Derbyshire association of loyalty to the king and government and contributed to a fund for raising a local defence regiment. It was doubtless of some embarrassment, however, that his steward Samuel Heathcote, a prominent Derby townsman, was taken up on a charge of treason as a Jacobite sympathizer. Curzon continued to play an active part in the Commons until well into old age. In 1749&#150;50 he was involved in patriotic initiatives to stimulate the domestic economy, particularly the nation's fishing industry, and was a subscriber to and member of the council of the Free British Fishery Society.<br>
<br>Since his succession to the family estates Curzon had added significantly to his landed fortune; in 1735 he inherited the Penn estate in Buckinghamshire from his mother's family, and his unmarried brother William, dying in 1749, bequeathed him an estate reckoned to be worth &pound;80,000. In addition his investments in major stocks amounted by this time to &pound;13,250. Curzon died on 16 November 1758 and was buried at All Saints' Church, Kedleston. His elder son and namesake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37335/', "Nathaniel Curzon")</script>, for whom he had made way as county MP in 1754, was raised to a barony in 1761. His other surviving son, Assheton (1730&#150;1820), who was MP for the family borough of Clitheroe from 1754 to 1780 and from 1792 until 1794, was created Baron Curzon of Penn in the latter year and raised to viscount in 1802, much to his elder brother's chagrin.<br>
