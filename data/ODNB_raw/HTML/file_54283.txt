<span class="headword">MacDonald, Sir  John, of Dunyvaig and the Glens</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1499), <span class="occ">clan chief</span>, was the son of Donald MacDonald (<i>d</i>. 1476/1481) and his wife, Siobhan O'Donnell, and the great-grandson of John MacDonald, first lord of the Isles (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1387), and his second wife, Margaret Stewart. His epithet refers to Dunyvaig on Islay and the Glens of Antrim in Ulster. His grandfather Iain Mor, who married the heiress of Bisset of the Glens, was founder of the southern branch of clan Donald based on Kintyre. John was associated with his father in the treaty of Westminster&#150;Ardtornish with Edward IV of England (1462) and appears as <i>r&iacute; Innse Gall</i> (&#145;king of the Isles&#146;) in Irish annals in 1499, having been called heir to John, fourth and last lord of the Isles, during his son Angus's rebellion in 1484. After the forfeiture of the lordship in 1493 MacDonald of Dunyvaig and Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh submitted to James IV and were knighted. The chronology of events at this point is not clear. According to the usually accurate annals of Ulster, Alexander was slain on Oronsay on 14 October 1494 by John Cattanach, Sir John's son, but a seventeenth-century source states that John MacIan of Ardnamurchan was the killer and was rewarded. (While the charter he received in June 1494 was a confirmation of lands already held by him, it was specifically granted in return for his obedience and good service.)<br>
<br>King James came to the west in July 1494 to take control of the castles of Tarbert and Dunaverty in Kintyre, and it was probably this that caused Sir John MacDonald to revolt. He captured Dunaverty and is said to have hanged the governor within sight of the king's fleet. MacDonald and his sons were summoned for treason; they fled to Islay and were taken by MacIan at Finlaggan at an unknown date. In July 1499 they were hanged at Edinburgh. The executions may have been intended to instil a fear of royal justice in the men of the Isles, and also to ensure that the MacDonalds of Dunyvaig did not become a focus for future opposition to the crown and its agents. MacDonald married a sister of Colin Campbell, first earl of Argyll; his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69917/', "Alexander MacDonald")</script> succeeded as MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens, carried on the family in Ulster, and was an ancestor of the earls of Antrim.<br>
