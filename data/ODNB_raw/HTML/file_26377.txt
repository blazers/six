<span class="headword">Stephens,  Alexander</span>  (1757&#150;1821), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born in Elgin where his father, Thomas Stephens, was provost from 1770 to 1771. His mother's maiden name was Fordyce. At the age of eighteen he left Aberdeen University for the West Indies, and stayed for some time in Jamaica. On his return he bought a commission in the 84th regiment, but never joined it as the regiment was reduced. At twenty-one he entered the Middle Temple, London, but gave more time to literature than to law, conducting a legal journal called <span class="italic">The Templar</span>, although he is said to have pleaded successfully before the House of Lords the claim of a distant relative, James Innes-Ker, duke of Roxburghe, to the title.<br>
<br>Stephens's first literary attempt was a poem on Jamaica. In 1803 he published a <span class="italic">History of the Wars which Arose out of the French Revolution</span>. In 1813 appeared his chief work, the <span class="italic">Memoirs of John Horne Tooke</span>, based on original letters and papers, as well as upon an acquaintance of several years. It deals with the quarrel between John Wilkes and Tooke in detail, and also examines the &#145;Junius&#146; affair closely. Reports of Tooke's conversation are included. The work was regarded in the nineteenth century as the best life of Tooke available.<br>
<br>Stephens was a frequent contributor of literary and biographical articles to the <span class="italic">Analytical Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>. He edited the first five volumes of the <span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span> (begun in 1817) and contributed most of the contents of the first nine volumes of <span class="italic">Public Characters</span>, issued by Sir Richard Phillips in 1823. He published numerous anonymous pamphlets, including in 1817 a brief memoir of John Philpot Curran. Despite his having very marked whiggish views, his biographies were considered fair and important.<br>
<br>In 1792 Stephens married Miss Lewin, daughter of Samuel Lewin, of Broadfield House in Hertfordshire; they had three children. He lived near Primrose Hill, Hampstead, where he wrote a brief autobiographical sketch which was published in the <span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span> a year after his death. Later he built Park House in Upper Church Lane, Chelsea, London, where he lived until his death there on 24 February 1821. He was buried in the new burial-ground, New Church, Chelsea. Between October 1821 and August 1824 the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> published &#145;Stephensiana&#146;, a series of articles consisting of anecdotes of his contemporaries collected by him.<br>
