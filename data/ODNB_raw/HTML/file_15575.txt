<span class="headword">King,  John</span>  (1652&#150;1732), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at St Columb, Cornwall, on 1 May 1652, the son of John King of Manaccan, Cornwall. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, as a poor scholar on 7 July 1674. He graduated BA in 1678 and proceeded MA in 1681; in 1698, when his friend Sir William Dawes was master of St Catharine's College, Cambridge, he was created DD there.<br>
<br>King's first position after ordination was as curate of Bray, Berkshire, when he evidently met Ann, youngest daughter of William Durham, whom he married on 9 September 1685. They had no children and Ann died within five years of their wedding. On 3 June 1690 King married, as his second wife, Elizabeth (1665/6&#150;1727), daughter of Joseph Aris of Adstone, Northamptonshire; the couple had three daughters and three sons, including the classical scholar and physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15574/', "John King")</script>. Elizabeth was the widow of the Revd John Eston, through whom he acquired the living of Pertenhall, Bedfordshire, to which he was immediately instituted on 7 June 1690. He vacated this benefice for institution by exchange to Chelsea on 22 November 1694, the two preferments being worth about &pound;150 a year each, but the stipend of the new living was greatly increased by letting the glebe for building in consequence of Chelsea's growing population. King stated in 1717 that the parish contained about 350 houses and that fifty years before there had been fewer than 40. The gravel soil, elevated position, and clear air of the place were thought particularly healthy, and many people, including Jonathan Swift in 1711, went there to benefit. King wrote, &#145;No village in the vicinity of London contributes more to the ease and recovery of asthmatical and consumptive persons&#146;  (Beaver, 49). King inherited the rectory in such a ruinous state that he had to buy a house in Church Lane (now Old Church Street). He may also have held the livings of West Wycombe (between 1684 and 1695) and of Harrold, Bedfordshire, from 1697 to at least 1710. He was collated to the prebendal stall of Weighton in York Minster by Dawes, now archbishop of York.<br>
<br>King was one of the earliest subscribers to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. As well as two sermons, King published anonymously against the nonconformist Increase Mather (<span class="italic">Animadversions on a Pamphlet Intituled a Letter of Advice to the Nonconformists</span>, which appeared in a second edition under his own name the following year) and the deist John Toland (<span class="italic">Tolando-pseudologo-mastix</span>, 1721). In 1710 he published <span class="italic">The Case of John Atherton</span>, a defence of the bishop of Waterford executed for buggery in 1640, which sought to clear his name and align his cause with that of other clerical victims of charges trumped up by enemies of the church. King's antiquarian interests were reflected in his manuscript account of Chelsea, from which extracts were drawn by later antiquarians, and the notes he prepared for Thomas Hearne on Sir Thomas More's house there.<br>
<br>King died at Church Lane, Chelsea, on 30 May 1732, and was buried in the chancel of Pertenhall church on 13 June; a large mural monument was erected to his memory. His wife died at Chelsea on 22 June 1727, aged sixty-one, and was also buried at Pertenhall. King was survived by five of his children, his son John having predeceased him in October 1728.<br>
