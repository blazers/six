<span class="headword">Maund,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1858), <span class="occ">physician and analytical chemist</span>, was born in High Street, Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, on 12 March 1823, the fourth of the six surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18376/', "Benjamin Maund (bap. 1790, d. 1864)")</script>, bookseller, botanist, and horticulturist, and his wife, Sarah Green (1792&#150;1857). Dogged by a delicate constitution, he was tutored privately in Kidderminster by William F. Matthews from 1834 to 1838 before being apprenticed to Mr Welsby, a surgeon of Prescott, Lancashire. In 1843 he went to the University of Glasgow where he gained several prizes, including first prize in pharmacology. In 1844 he moved to London, where he was assistant surgeon at St Pancras Infirmary. In 1845 to 1846 he visited Paris to further his medical training. He gained membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (1844&#150;5), the licence of the Society of Apothecaries (1846&#150;7), a doctorate of medicine from St Andrews University (1849), and certificates from the Royal College of Chemistry and the Royal Polytechnic Institution in London. In 1853, having sold his practice in Harlow, Essex, he emigrated to Australia with his eldest sister, Eliza, intending to take up less fatiguing work as an analytical chemist. However, Maund, a man of exceptional personal qualities, could not ignore the tremendous medical problems facing Melbourne in the early gold rush years and immediately set up again in general practice. In 1855 he helped unite two professional bodies into the Medical Society of Victoria, and in 1856 was founding editor of the <span class="italic">Australian Medical Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Maund's greatest achievement arose from his concern for the many mothers whose babies were being born in tents, at the roadside, even on the wharf, and in 1856, together with Dr Richard Tracy, he founded the first lying-in hospital (later the Royal Women's Hospital). He was awarded a doctorate of medicine <i>ad eundem</i> from the University of Melbourne. As Victoria's first analytical chemist he undertook important research into Melbourne's water supply, especially on the Yan Yean Reservoir scheme. Maund died unmarried on 3 April 1858 at his home, 53 La Trobe Street East, Melbourne, from a sudden attack of what was probably typhoid and was buried in Melbourne general cemetery two days later. He was deeply mourned for his professional skills, his personal qualities, and his devotion to the poor. The hospital commissioned his portrait, his father unveiled a memorial window to him in St John's, Bromsgrove, and Ferdinand Mueller named a new genus of the rush family after him, <i>Juncanigineae Maundia</i>. In 1964 the annual Tracy&#150;Maund memorial lectures were instituted by the Australian Medical Association.<br>
