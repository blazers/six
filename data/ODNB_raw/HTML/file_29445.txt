<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Willet,  Andrew</span>  (1561/2&#150;1621), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Ely, the son of Thomas Willet (1511?&#150;1598), rector of Barley, Hertfordshire, and prebendary of Ely Cathedral, the latter on the presentation of his patron Bishop Richard Cox. After studying at the collegiate school at Ely, Willet went to Cambridge, where on 2 February 1577, aged fifteen, he was admitted to Peterhouse (whose master was his godfather Andrew Perne, after whom he was named). His move to Christ's College in the same year foreshadowed the godly convictions that would animate his subsequent career. He was elected a scholar, graduated BA in 1581, and proceeded MA in 1584 (being incorporated at Oxford the same year). As a fellow of Christ's from 1583 he moved in puritan circles: his collection of sacred emblems (published in 1588 with a dedication to the earl of Essex) contains verses dedicated to all the famous Cambridge godly divines of the day, including William Whitaker and Laurence Chaderton.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon in London on 25 April 1584 and priest the following year, Willet was preacher at Bourn and Fen Drayton, Cambridgeshire, between 1585 and 1588, and was presented by the queen on 21 June 1587 to his father's prebendal stall at Ely. The following year he left the university and resigned his fellowship on marrying Jacobine (<i>d</i>. 1637), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10847/', "Roger Goad (1538&#150;1610)")</script>, the godly provost of King's College, and his wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. in or after 1610), and being presented to the rectory of Childerley in Cambridgeshire. In the following years he gave series of lectures at both Ely Cathedral and at St Paul's in London. He proceeded BD in 1591 and DD in 1601. Appointed to the rectory of Gransden Parva, Huntingdonshire, in 1597, he swiftly exchanged it for the living of Barley when it fell vacant on his father's death in April 1598. He was instituted to the living on 29 January 1599 and served there until his death.<br>
<br>A prolific author, Willet published in 1592 the first edition of what became his most famous work, <span class="italic">Synopsis papismi</span>. Throughout Willet's career this survey of all the controversies between the protestants and the Church of Rome went through a series of new editions and expansions, which saw it swell from a quarto edition of 600 pages to its posthumous fifth edition of over 1300 folio pages (including a life of the author by Peter Smith), published in 1634. The royal patent for this fifth edition, &#145;tendring the good of our loving Subjects in matters of Religion especially&#146;, noted approvingly of Willet's work that &#145;it hath beene seene and allowed by &hellip; the Reverend Bishops, and hath alsoe ever since byn in greate esteeme in both of our Universities, and also much desired by all the Learned both of our clergy and laity throughout our Dominions&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 100&#150;02).<br>
<br>For all his godly contacts, Willet seems to have managed to avoid the presbyterian and nonconformist activities of his day. Holding the family prebendal stall in Ely, he had natural sympathies with the established church, even if he was far from being an uncritical admirer of its ceremonies. He was most concerned, however, by the growth of anti-Calvinist doctrines in Cambridge in the 1590s, and by the writings of Richard Hooker and his disciples in particular. He may well have been involved in the anonymous <span class="italic">Christian Letter</span> published against Hooker's <span class="italic">Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</span> (many of the <span class="italic">Letter</span>'s arguments appear in Willet's later writings in 1603&#150;4), and the dedicatory epistle to the third edition of the <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> (published in 1600) bore a dedication to Archbishop John Whitgift and Bishop Richard Bancroft which applauded their actions against the puritan movement, but warned of the broaching of new semi-popish doctrines.<br>
<br>The conditional nature of Willet's support for the ecclesiastical <i>status quo</i> became clearer with the accession of James I to the throne in 1603. Sensing the opportunity for further church reform, Willet hastily presented James at Hinchingbrooke with a copy of the 1600 <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, but with the previous dedicatory epistle removed and a new one to the king substituted in which he urged James that &#145;God hath a greate worke to be perfected by your hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, 1603, sig. A4<i>v</i>). In a series of tracts over the next two years&#151;most notably <span class="italic">An Antilogie</span> (1603) and <span class="italic">Ecclesia triumphans</span> (1604)&#151;Willet petitioned the king that in the case of those indifferent ceremonies which had generated such puritan hostility, James might remove &#145;the just occasions of offence; or so indifferently moderate them, that they breede no strife&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antilogie</span>, preface). His hope was that under James, the reformation of religion begun under the Tudors &#145;might in good time be perfected and accomplished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ecclesia triumphans</span>, 86). At the same time, he appealed for the suppression of new books by writers (presumably including Hooker) &#145;maintaining offensive doctrine, too much declining to poperie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antilogie</span>, preface). Such audacious appeals soon won Willet enemies, but it seems to have been his appeal to parliament in <span class="italic">Limbo-mastix</span> (1604) for an official augmentation to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> which would prevent the recent &#145;Arminian&#146; glosses that prompted severe attacks on the book and its author by William Barlow in the preface to Barlow's official account of the Hampton Court conference, and in the 1604 convocation. Another minor author, Richard Parkes, falsely accused Willet of promoting presbyterianism. Willet vehemently denied these charges, protesting (correctly) that he had dedicated more works to bishops and prelates than had any other contemporary Church of England author (although he did in his <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> deny that episcopacy existed by divine right).<br>
<br>But in the face of these attacks and the passing of the 1604 canons, Willet shrank from any further direct involvement in religious politics. He appealed for Bancroft's support, and it seems to have been Bancroft who advised him to turn his attention to the less controversial world of biblical commentary. In the following years Willet dedicated his energies to the production of a remarkable series of encyclopaedic works of biblical exegesis, which provided the reader with a detailed guide to variant readings and doctrinal issues pertaining to every single verse of the text under study. His &#145;Harmonie&#146; on <span class="roman">1 Samuel</span> (1607) was followed by commentaries on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> (1595 and 1608), <span class="roman">Exodus</span> (1608), <span class="roman">Daniel</span> (1610), <span class="roman">Romans</span> (1611), <span class="roman">2 Samuel</span> (1614), and <span class="roman">Leviticus</span> (posthumously published in 1631). The regular appearance of these folio works in clerical libraries testifies to their enormous practical value to contemporary clergymen. These works of exegesis provide important commentaries on virtually every religious issue and controversy of the day, and although they continued to warn of vanities, or elaborate ritual, in cathedral churches and services, a gradual moderation of Willet's views can sometimes be traced. For example, while his 1611 commentary on <span class="roman">Romans</span> still maintained a firmly Calvinist position on predestination, he explicitly retracted the supralapsarian stance that he had espoused in his <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> of 1600, and maintained a sublapsarian position &#145;as the safest from any inconvenience, and the fittest to give satisfaction to the contrarie objections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hexapla on Romans</span>, 1631, 443).<br>
<br>In producing this extraordinary body of work, Willet combined eight hours of work a day in his study with his busy domestic life according to a careful schedule described by his biographer, Peter Smith. He would rise earlier than anyone else in his family and begin his studies, then take his family to the church for morning prayers, and then return to work &#145;until near dinner-time, when his manner was to recreate himself a while, either with playing upon a little organ which he had in his house, singing unto it, or else sporting himself with his young children&#146;. After dinner he would walk abroad &#145;now and then taking some little view of the business of his husbandry about the grounds&#146; before returning to his study to work until supper time  (Willet, 1852, 1.50). Smith, who himself lived in Willet's house for a while, memorably describes the extraordinary religious discipline that pervaded the household, with the family attending services twice a day, the many children required to read and learn passages of scripture daily, and laws and ordinances for the household (complete with penalties for offences) set up in notices around the house.<br>
<br>Whatever his hours of study and absorbing domestic life, however, it would be misleading to imply that Willet retreated from public life. His lifelong concern to increase the stipends of clergy meant that he was active in persuading the dean and chapter of Ely to provide grants from their impropriated rectories and tithes. One of his DD theses in 1601 had stated that tithes should be <i>jure divino</i>, by divine right, and in his later <span class="italic">Hexapla in Leviticum</span> (1631) he declared that usurpers of tithes committed the sin of sacrilege and incurred the danger of eternal damnation. Willet also had a broader interest in the matter of charity. Later editions of his <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> contain an enormous catalogue of charitable activities by English protestants which he industriously assembled (through circulation of questionnaires throughout the country) to refute Roman Catholic claims that protestants neglected such good works. But Willet was as adept at securing such bequests as he was at listing them. He was active in persuading people then resident in Cambridge and London to make bequests to the poor of Barley, and is credited by Smith with having been particularly influential in securing the erection of Sutton Hospital. On a personal level, Willet gave doles of bread to the poor, but with a pointed religious message&#151;on coronation days and on 5 November.<br>
<br>Despite his chastening experiences on the public stage at the beginning of James's reign, Willet still remained closely involved in public affairs. His living of Barley was located a very short distance from King James's favourite hunting-lodge at Royston, and a mere 14 miles from Cambridge. Willet retained his contacts in court circles: he continued to dedicate his books to the king as well as the principal bishops, and he served as chaplain to Prince Henry, to whom he also dedicated several works (indeed, <span class="italic">A Catholicon</span> (1603) stands out as the only work which Willet dedicated to his immediate neighbours). He also published a sermon celebrating the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to the elector palatine, declaring that &#145;the combination of religion, and propagation of the Gospel is principally sought in this hopeful mariage&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Treatise of Salomons Mariage</span>, 1612&#150;13, 56), and contrasting it with the country's perverse and unsuccessful marriages with Catholic France and Spain. These remarks made it inevitable that Willet would be vehemently opposed to the projected Spanish marriage for Prince Charles. In December 1617 Willet wrote to Sir John Higham urging him to distribute a paper among those Norfolk and Suffolk JPs likely to be elected to the next parliament. Willet's paper argued that the next parliament should make a liberal contribution to the king in order that financial problems did not induce him towards the Spanish marriage. He included a series of arguments against the planned marriage, including the reflection that Catholics held it lawful to kill heretical kings, and that any children of the marriage would &#145;suck in there Mothers Religion with there milk&#146; (a prophecy which ultimately, of course, was proved correct). Despite the fact that Willet's tract hoped to hinder the match by helping the king in other ways, Willet was imprisoned when Higham's correspondence was intercepted, although he was apparently released after a month.<br>
<br>From 1613 Willet was briefly rector of Reed as well as of nearby Barley, but he resigned the office in 1615 in favour of his eldest son, Andrew (<i>bap</i>. 1591, <i>d</i>. in or after 1646). In 1620 he was presented to Chishill Parva, just over the border in Essex, but in the following year he died in unusual circumstances. While journeying back from London after discussing the future printing of his <span class="italic">Hexapla in Leviticum</span>, his horse stumbled and he fell, breaking his right leg; it was subsequently set so badly that he died ten days later, on 4 December, at the nearby inn at Hoddesdon to which he had ridden. He was buried four days later, as he had requested, in the chancel of Barley parish church. His will, made on 24 November 1621, shows him to have been a prosperous man at his death, owning several properties and advowsons, and he made generous settlements on his wife (who was buried in 1637 at his side) and his thirteen surviving children, who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29446/', "Thomas Willet (1610/11&#150;1674)")</script>. Two funeral sermons were given, by Thomas Newcomen, parson of nearby Heydon, and by Mr Greene of Royston, and for a long time afterwards his death was lamented in their sermons by the lecturers of Royston. Willet left behind over twenty published works, many of which went through several different editions as well as numerous reprintings, although Smith claimed that he left a further nine unprinted works, which do not appear to have survived. Different sections of the <span class="italic">Synopsis papismi</span> were also published abroad in Latin translation in a number of different editions, and were read approvingly by divines as varied as the Dutch Calvinist Festus Hommius and the German Lutheran Johannes Gerhard.<br>
<br>Historians have long debated whether Willet should be labelled a puritan, with Daniel Neal and Benjamin Brook happy to reckon him as such, whereas others such as Augustus Toplady were keen to deny this, the better to recruit Willet as an unimpeachable source for the Church of England's doctrinal Calvinism. The matter ultimately comes down to how a puritan is to be defined. There is certainly no evidence that Willet failed to conform to the ceremonies and discipline of the established church. It is also clear, however, that he was prepared to argue for further reform of the church, that he enjoyed good relations with puritan divines, who regarded him as one of their own, and that his published writings reflect a strongly Calvinist and vehemently anti-Catholic world-view. Unlike many conforming Calvinists, he seems to have been ready to oppose the writings of Richard Hooker, as well as to question the <i>jure divino</i> status of episcopacy, and his anxiety at the turn of the century that semi-popish opinions were being maintained which required official suppression would seem to ally him naturally with those more emphatically puritan writers who voiced the same concerns. His efforts to encourage further reformation at the beginning of James's reign were innocent of the presbyterian agenda that his opponents claimed, but would have made him a natural signatory of the millenary petition and supporter of those moderate puritans who spoke at the Hampton Court conference (his <span class="italic">Retection</span> of 1603 anticipates their complaints at the conference concerning lay baptism, for example). Ultimately, however, Willet was, like his father, an instinctive supporter of the established church: &#145;to complaine of some abuses of the Church&#146;, he explained, &#145;is not to exclaime against the Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Loidoromastix</span>, 1607, 16). He was happiest when he could praise the deeds of doctrinally orthodox preaching bishops such as George Abbot and John King. The attacks made upon him by William Barlow and Richard Parkes shocked him into political silence, but the troubles surrounding the Spanish match make it clear that Willet would have struggled to acquiesce to those moments in the 1620s when a violently anti-Catholic political agenda might not accord with government policy. The question of his &#145;puritanism&#146; is thus a semantic one: Willet's real significance lies in the evidence that he provides of just how strongly anti-Catholic and Calvinist ideas could be held at this period by a clergyman who combined active membership of the established church with readiness to question the orthodoxy of Richard Hooker and his allies as spokesmen of that church. Willet thus became a favourite source for anti-Laudian writers in the 1630s, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for those divines anxious to maintain the Calvinist and strongly anti-Catholic credentials of the Church of England. In 1852 his most substantial work, the <span class="italic">Synopsis papismi</span>, was republished in ten volumes by the British Society for Promoting the Religious Principles of the Reformation, with the editor urging that influential people should arrange for a copy of the work to be placed in every parish library in the country, the better to promote the protestant cause and frustrate the designs of the pope. Willet's shade would surely have smiled at the thought.<br>
