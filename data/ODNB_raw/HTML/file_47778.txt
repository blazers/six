<span class="headword">Dicksee,  Lawrence Robert</span>  (1864&#150;1932), <span class="occ">accountant and writer on accounting</span>, was born on 1 May 1864 at 27 Howland Street, London, the youngest of five children of John Robert Dicksee (1817&#150;1905), artist, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnard. He grew up in a family with strong artistic associations, and was the cousin of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32819/', "Francis Bernard Dicksee (1853&#150;1928)")</script>. Dicksee was educated at the City of London School (<i>c</i>.1867&#150;1881) , where his father taught between 1852 and 1897, holding the position of head drawing-master. He was articled in 1881 to the chartered accountant George Norton Read, whose office was at 31 Queen Victoria Street, in the City of London. This was just one year after the formation of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and in November 1886 Dicksee was one of the earliest to qualify for membership by examination. He then set up in practice in London, three years later joining Peter Price in Cardiff to form Price and Dicksee. Dicksee returned to London in 1894 as partner (from 1898 senior partner) in Sellars, Dicksee &amp; Co. in the City of London. Dicksee married in 1894 Nora Beatrice, daughter of Rowland Plumbe FRIBA. The couple lived at a number of addresses in north London before settling at Hampstead, about 1908. They had one son who was a casualty of the 1914&#150;18 war.<br>
<br>It has been said that fraud was endemic in Victorian business, and it is widely believed that the young accountancy profession did much to establish its reputation by the ability of accountants to discover and disentangle the financial implications of fraudulent schemes. Dicksee, together with Peter Price's son, discovered one such fraud at the Cardiff Building Society in 1890, &pound;8500 (at that time a substantial sum) having been stolen by the society's bookkeeper. Dicksee also demonstrated an early interest in education. He took evening classes at the University of South Wales and Monmouthshire, and in 1892 published <span class="italic">Auditing: a Practical Manual for Auditors</span>. Dicksee's <span class="italic">Auditing</span> was a major landmark in the development of an accounting literature. It was the second major textbook on auditing (the first was F. W. Pixley's <span class="italic">Auditors, their Duties and Responsibilities</span>, 1881), but contained a much broader coverage of accounting matters than did its predecessor. It was phenomenally influential, being read both by students preparing for professional examinations and by practising accountants. It ran to fourteen British editions during Dicksee's lifetime. The impact of Dicksee's <span class="italic">Auditing</span> was not merely local: Robert H. Montgomery, founder of the firm which became the American segment of Coopers and Lybrand, published, with permission, an American version of Dicksee's <span class="italic">Auditing</span> in 1905. Indeed, it has been said that Montgomery's adaptation of Dicksee's text to American needs marked the beginning of an American literature in accounting.<br>
<br>Dicksee's experience with the Cardiff Building Society may well have been responsible for the famous text's emphasis (possibly overemphasis) on the detection of error and fraud as audit objectives. The weight given to these matters by Dicksee has been interpreted as evidence of a late nineteenth-century preoccupation with error and fraud detection to the exclusion of the informational content of published accounts. There is growing evidence to suggest that the nineteenth-century audit was rather more broadly based, and it is possible that Dicksee's influential text may have contributed to a narrowing in the scope of the audit in the years that followed.<br>
<br>A second major textbook, entitled <span class="italic">Advanced Accounting</span>, appeared in 1903, and many other books and articles by Dicksee were published. Not all his writing carried his name and he is thought to have been responsible for a great deal of editorial comment in <span class="italic">The Accountant</span>&#151;the highly influential and authoritative journal first published in 1874. The conclusion that Dicksee &#145;provided a literature for accounting single-handed&#146;  (Kitchen and Parker, 218) is ambitious but not without foundation.<br>
<br>Dicksee's two major texts were principally directed towards the identification of best practice and encouraging its more widespread adoption. Concerns with the need for conservatism and the strict application of the realization principle (the recognition of profit at the time a sale takes place) feature prominently in his writings. Dicksee's later work grew increasingly critical of contemporary practice. The period after the First World War was marked by the growing use of secret reserves, a device for smoothing reported profits and dividend payments, based on the conviction that a significant upturn in profits gives rise to demands for larger dividends and disappointment on the part of the capital market and shareholders generally when the rate must be cut. Secret reserves, viewed favourably by many of the profession's leaders until the revelations in the case of <i>R. v. Lord Kyslant and another</i> in 1931, were the subject of swingeing criticism by Dicksee in a public lecture delivered at the London School of Economics (LSE) on 7 October 1920, as was the practice of using omnibus headings to encapsulate most of the assets belonging to a company in a single financial total.<br>
<br>The development of accounting as an academic discipline was slower in Britain than in the USA and Europe. Dicksee's appointment to the first British chair of accounting within the faculty of commerce at the University of Birmingham in 1902 was an early encouraging development, however. He combined this part-time appointment with a lectureship at the LSE. He was awarded an honorary MCom by Birmingham in 1903, but resigned his appointment there three years later in order to give more time to his work at the LSE, where he became professor of accounting in business organization in 1914, reflecting the commercial orientation of his commitments. In 1919 he was appointed Sir Ernest Cassel professor of accounting when the London commerce degree was introduced, and served as dean of the faculty of economics at the University of London for the 1925&#150;6 session, at the end of which he retired. Dicksee died of cancer at his home, Hazeboro Lodge, 153 Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park, London, on 14 February 1932. His wife survived him.<br>
