<span class="headword">Manson,  George</span>  (1850&#150;1876), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and landscape and genre painter</span>, was born on 3 December 1850 in Edinburgh, the son of Magnus Manson, a merchant. As a boy he was encouraged to paint by his father, who was an amateur artist. He read the works of John Ruskin and worked his way through all the practical exercises in <span class="italic">The Elements of Drawing</span> (1857). On leaving school he began an apprenticeship with the publishers William and Robert Chambers, where he worked as a punch cutter, making the steel dies used in the production of printers' type. Rising very early in the morning before work, he would sketch various scenes around his home on the southern outskirts of Edinburgh. He joined the Craigmillar Sketching Association and for their monthly meetings made numerous sketches of the oldest buildings in Edinburgh. This he called his &#145;religious work&#146;  (Gray, 8), since he viewed himself as a conservationist recording the ancient buildings before they were destroyed. This work later led him to have a deep admiration for the haunting Parisian views of Charles Meryon.<br>
<br>Manson worked in pencil, watercolour, and oils but also made wood-engravings from an early age. Inspired by the work of Thomas Bewick, his blocks are simply composed and forthright. In 1870 he competed for a prize offered to apprentices by the Edinburgh Society of Engravers on Wood. Manson's work did not sufficiently meet the exacting stipulations of the award for him to win the main prize, but the quality of his entry&#151;a study of a farm with trees and sheep grazing in a field&#151;was nevertheless noticed by the judge, and he was awarded a special prize in recognition of his &#145;artistic feeling in landscape&#146;. He first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1869 with <span class="italic">Study of a Doorway at Craigmillar Castle</span>. In 1870 he exhibited <span class="italic">Milking Time</span> and the following year <span class="italic">Children at a Well</span>. It was perhaps the encouragement of other artists that prompted him to become a professional painter that year: James Cassie bought the last of these three paintings and became one of many artists who admired and patronized Manson throughout his short career.<br>
<br>Mixing with such artists and studying at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh, Manson soon came under the influence of realist European artists, and particularly the Dutch Hague school of painters. In 1873 he visited Europe with W. D. McKay (1844&#150;1924): in Paris they sketched from the paintings in the Louvre and, with a letter of introduction from the art connoisseur John Forbes White, called on the Dutch genre painter Adolphe Artz. In The Hague they visited Josef Israels. Influenced by the work of the Dutch artists with whom he had become acquainted Manson began to concentrate on depicting seascapes and fishing folk: like Israels, he became renowned for his ability to depict the pathos of working-class life.<br>
<br>In 1874 the first signs of consumption pre-empted a visit to Sark, but Manson continued to visit Scotland, touring the highlands and spending prolonged periods of time in Edinburgh and Galashiels. In January 1875 he travelled to France with Patrick W. Adam (1854&#150;1930) and there began to etch, receiving instruction from a M. Cadart. In St L&ocirc; he contracted pneumonia, and thereafter his physical decline was rapid. On his return to Britain he settled in Shirley, near Croydon. His last known work was a small study for a scene from Allan Ramsay's <span class="italic">Gentle Shepherd</span> (1725). He died of consumption at Lympstone in Devon on 27 February 1876 and was buried in Culliford churchyard. Three years later more than 300 subscribers funded the publication of a book on Manson and his art. Compiled by J. M. Gray, it served as a fitting testimonial to Manson's artistic achievements. In 1881 an exhibition of his watercolours was held in London; his expert use of both detailed brushwork and &#145;wet&#146; watercolour washes attracted great interest and the admiration of critics and artists alike.<br>
