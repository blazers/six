<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kravchinsky, Sergey Mikhailovich</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Stepniak]</span>  (1851&#150;1895), <span class="occ">revolutionary and author</span>, was born on 1 July 1851 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> in Novy Starodub, Aleksandriya district, Kherson province of the Russian empire (roughly in the centre of what is now Ukraine). He was the second son and third of the four children of Mikhail Faddeevich Kravchinsky (<i>d</i>. 1865), a Belarusian army doctor, and Lyubov Yakovlevna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levinskaya (<i>d</i>. 1887), a Ukrainian noblewoman. Before settling in London for good in 1884, he was highly peripatetic. Between 1858 and 1865 his father's work took him to the Ukrainian towns of Yelizavetgrad, Uman, Chuguev, and Slavyansk. His mother then retired to Kremenchug. He left Ukraine for Russia to go to an army gymnasium in Oryol and completed his education between 1867 and 1870 at specialized military schools in Moscow and St Petersburg. On becoming an artillery officer he was sent back to Ukraine to serve as an instructor in the Kharkov military district, but in 1871 he left the army and entered the Forestry Institute in St Petersburg. After two years of a three-year course of study he left this too. Russian populism, the doctrine of sympathy for the common people, was reaching its peak. Craggy (if short-sighted), good with his hands, utterly fearless, and profoundly spiritual (his close associate Prince Peter Kropotkin was to say of him that &#145;he knew the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> almost by heart&#146;; Kropotkin, 322), Kravchinsky was no less likely and much better qualified than his fellow students to participate in the celebrated &#145;going to the people&#146; to which several thousand of them committed themselves in 1873 and 1874.<br>
<br>Like the majority of his peers, Kravchinsky was arrested (when working as a sawyer in the province of Tver in November 1873). Unlike most of them, however, he immediately escaped (with the help of a peasant). After dodging the authorities for more than a year, he went abroad for the first time in the spring of 1875 and turned up in the next six months in Brussels, London, Paris, Herzegovina, Lugano, and Geneva. In London he had business with an older Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;, Pyotr Lavrov, the publisher of his early writings (stories for peasants); in Herzegovina he fought in the opening round of the Balkan crisis of 1875&#150;8; in Lugano he was converted by the elderly anarchist Mikhail Bakunin to the merits of political violence. Early in 1876 he went back to Russia in the hope of helping the populists to recover from the mass arrests which had decimated their ranks. At the end of the year he left again, this time for Sicily (because the wife of one of his comrades was dying and needed a warm climate). Drawn into Errico Malatesta's Benevento uprising, he spent nine months in an Italian gaol. A beneficiary of the amnesty which followed the accession of Umberto I in January 1878, he returned once more to St Petersburg and on 4 August 1878 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> consummated his career as a practitioner of revolutionary violence by stabbing to death General N. V. Mezentsev, the head of the tsar's &#145;third department&#146; (secret police). After a remarkable escape from the scene of the crime he published a pamphlet whose subtitle, <span class="italic">A Death for a Death</span>, testified to his belief in terror.<br>
<br>In the next few years, however, Kravchinsky abandoned or at least seriously modified his terrorist convictions. In emigration again (in Geneva in 1878&#150;81 and 1882&#150;4; in Milan in 1881&#150;2; in London from early July 1884 to the end of his life), he came to believe that the social justice to which he had committed himself at the beginning of the 1870s could be achieved by the introduction of a constitution for the Russian empire, by literary rather than military methods, and by working for consensus among Russian revolutionaries. The many reasons which have been adduced for this shift in his outlook constitute one of the principal talking points of his career. Possibilities include the start, in 1878, of his lifelong relationship with Fanni Markovna Lichkus (<i>c</i>.1853&#150;1945) (with whom he had a daughter who died within a few days of her birth in 1879); friendship in Geneva with the scholarly and pacific Ukrainian federalist Mykhailo Drahomanov; fear of capture by the tsarist secret police, who were increasingly active in western Europe from the beginning of the 1880s and whose activities may have been part of the reason why, in 1881, he assumed the pseudonym Stepniak (&#145;Man of the Steppes&#146;); and the realization that, if even the populists' assassination of Alexander II in March 1881 did not incline the tsarist authorities to give ground, no amount of violence was likely to do so.<br>
<br>An explanation of Kravchinsky's change of heart that does not appear to stand up to scrutiny is the notion that he changed his views under the influence of long residence in supposedly moderate Britain, for the moderation he displayed as Stepniak is present even in some of the things he wrote as Kravchinsky. It needs to be said, furthermore, that the pseudonymous Stepniak did not abandon the views of Kravchinsky altogether, for his first book to be published in English, <span class="italic">Underground Russia</span> (London, 1883; first published in Italian as newspaper articles in 1881&#150;2 and as a book in 1882), declared that &#145;The Terrorist &hellip; is noble, terrible, irresistibly fascinating, for he combines in himself the two sublimities of human grandeur: the martyr and the hero&#146;  (pp. 40&#150;41). Nor does Stepniak's novel of 1889, <span class="italic">The Career of a Nihilist</span>, portray its admittedly unsuccessful hero in an unfavourable light. It is possible, therefore, that in Britain Stepniak did not so much renounce his past as keep quiet about it. His youthful exploits certainly came as a shock to at least one of his British admirers when she read about them in a London periodical of January 1894 (<span class="italic">Tea and Anarchy!</span>, 239&#150;40; <span class="italic">Olive and Stepniak</span>, 1&#150;10, 19). Perhaps, then, it is sensible to characterize Stepniak as a moderate who never wholly denied the merits of direct action.<br>
<br>Apart from <span class="italic">The Career of a Nihilist</span>, Kravchinsky's original publications as Stepniak&#151;<span class="italic">Russia under the Tzars</span> (1885), <span class="italic">The Russian Storm-Cloud</span> (1886), <span class="italic">The Russian Peasantry</span> (1888), <span class="italic">King Stork and King Log</span> (1895)&#151;were repositories of information rather than calls to action. It is true that <span class="italic">Nihilism as it is</span>, which also came out under the pseudonym Stepniak in 1894, was of a programmatic rather than an empirical nature, but the essays which it contained had already appeared in Russian. Although the descriptive books took a much less sanguine view of the Russian empire than their immediate precursor in English, Donald Mackenzie Wallace's <span class="italic">Russia</span> (1877), they nevertheless pretended, as reportage, to be objective, and they certainly adopted a much more judicious tone than, say (to take a much later example of a book by a Russian dissident published outside Russia), Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's <span class="italic">Gulag Archipelago</span> of the 1970s. It is some indication of their relative moderation that they enabled Stepniak to forge relationships with British people (and Americans) of many different political allegiances.<br>
<br>Kravchinsky's British friends in his early days in London were mainly socialists. He met George Bernard Shaw, for example, within three weeks of his arrival, at the demonstration which took place in Hyde Park on 21 July 1884 to protest about the House of Lords' resistance to the <span class="roman">Third Reform Bill</span>. He knew Edward Pease, the secretary of the Fabian Society, before the latter moved to Newcastle upon Tyne in 1886, for the two corresponded frequently in the years that Pease spent there. William Morris and Sidney Webb were other early acquaintances. Yet even in the mid-1880s Stepniak's British associates included William Westall (novelist and journalist on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who helped him to &#145;English&#146; <span class="italic">Russia under the Tzars</span>) and W. Earl Hodgson (another journalist on <span class="italic">The Times</span>, whose principal interest lay in fishing). In later years his main British political associates were Liberals. Robert Spence Watson, a Newcastle lawyer who was shortly to become the president of the National Liberal Federation, was so impressed by a lecture that he gave to an audience of 1500 people in the Tyne Theatre in Newcastle on 24 February 1889 that he decided that &#145;something had to be done&#146;  (F. Volkhovsky, obituary of Spence Watson, <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>, July 1911, 2). In conjunction with Prince Peter Kropotkin, Thomas Burt MP, and others, Spence Watson and Stepniak established a Society of Friends of Russian Freedom at the beginning of 1890 which survived until 1914. Its journal, <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>, became one of the best-known outlets for anti-tsarist opinion in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain.<br>
<br>In 1891 Stepniak and four of his Russian associates established a Russian Free Press Fund in London to provide a context for his continuing activities as Kravchinsky. The flysheets of this body (<i>letuchie listki</i>) enabled him to demonstrate to other Russian exiles (notably Georgy Plekhanov in Geneva) that he was still engaged in the quest for their &#145;holy grail&#146;, the pooling of the Russian dissidents' scattered resources. Fate, however, prevented him from bringing his work among the Russian exiles to a head, for he was knocked down by a train on 23 December 1895 when walking across the North London Railway between Acton and Chiswick at a level crossing at the end of his street (Woodstock Road, Bedford Park, Middlesex, where he had lived since 1892, having previously been based in St John's Wood). Lost in thought, he was on his way to a fellow Russian's flat in Shepherd's Bush, where plans were to be finalized for a new Russian-language newspaper in which Russian exiles of many different stripes were to play a part.<br>
<br>Stepniak's funeral took the form of a public meeting at Waterloo Station on 28 December 1895. The thirteen speakers included Kropotkin, Malatesta, Spence Watson, William Morris, Keir Hardie, and John Burns. After the meeting his body was taken to Woking for cremation (without ceremony). A public collection provided his indigent widow with some assistance and enabled her to arrange the translation of some of her husband's English-language work into Russian. She sold his personal papers to the Soviet Union in the 1930s. In April 1944 his British socialist friends affixed a plaque in his memory to a cottage he had frequented in Pastens Lane, Limpsfield, Surrey. It is hard not to suppose that the Soviet authorities purchased his papers in order to suppress them, for his populist creed differed markedly from theirs and a major Russian-language study of his life did not appear until 1973. In Britain, Stepniak's legacy was above all literary, for the most prolific translator of the Russian classics into English, Constance Garnett, learned Russian in his circle, and it has been argued that Joseph Conrad's <span class="italic">Under Western Eyes</span> represents, in part, a fictionalization of his relationship with Olive Garnett (the translator's sister-in-law). He was one of the few Russian exiles ever to have lived in Britain who attracted significant attention in both Anglophone and Russophone contexts.<br>
