<span class="headword">Winskill, Sir  Archibald Little</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 24 January 1917 at 3 Middlegate, Penrith, Cumberland, the son of James Winskill, a motor mechanic then serving in the navy, later a car dealer, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Little. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Penrith, and Carlisle grammar school; then, having shown a decided mechanical bent, from 1934 to 1939 was a trainee for a traffic apprenticeship at the London and North Eastern Railway works in Edinburgh. In 1937, in a move which was to determine the whole course of his future career, he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a trainee pilot and was given basic flying training.<br>
<br>Like hundreds of other reservists Winskill was mobilized on the outbreak of the Second World War. On 24 August 1940 he was commissioned as a pilot officer in the RAF, and his first posting was to no. 8 bombing and gunnery school; then he was sent to an operational training unit&#151;no. 7 at Harwarden&#151;and from there to 54 squadron, a Spitfire squadron at Hornchurch. He then served briefly with 72 and 603 squadrons before being posted to 41 squadron, where he was appointed a flight commander.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1941 Winskill was reported missing. As part of the Tangmere wing he had been escorting Blenheims in an attack on a target near Lille when they were intercepted by Messerschmitt Bf 109s, one of which he shot down. His Spitfire was then hit and set on fire, forcing him to bale out. A French farmer took him to a cornfield, where he hid until nightfall; then the farmer's son took him into the farmhouse, where he was fed, and subsequently provided him with food daily until he could be sent to a &#145;safe house&#146;. After two weeks his escape odyssey began&#151;by bicycle, dressed as a farm worker, to a series of other houses until he was put on a train for Paris. There he was taken over by the Pat O'Leary escape line, which had a very successful record of escorting allied airmen and soldiers through occupied France into Spain. He went by train to Marseilles, then to Aix-les-Thermes in the Pyrenean foothills. With two other evaders he was guided over the mountains by an Andorran with local knowledge; they reached Barcelona, where the British consul-general arranged for them to be sent to Gibraltar via Madrid. Three months after being shot down Winskill was safely back in the UK, though forbidden to fly over Europe again because of his knowledge of escape routes. He was subsequently awarded the DFC.<br>
<br>From December 1941 Winskill served in three fighter squadrons&#151;145, 611, and 165&#151;before being given his first commands as squadron leader, briefly of 72 and 222 squadrons and finally of 232 squadron, eastern air command, Africa. This squadron provided close air support for the British First Army in Algeria and Tunisia. On 18 January 1943 he was shot down off the Tunisian coast and forced to bale out for the second time, coming down in the sea. He swam ashore, behind enemy lines, evaded capture, and rejoined his squadron. From April 1943 he was back on operations, shooting down a Stuka dive-bomber, sharing in the destruction of another, and ground strafing retreating axis forces. His north African tour ended in June 1943, when he was awarded a bar to his DFC. He served for the rest of the war at the Central Gunnery School, Sutton Bridge; he was promoted wing commander in March 1944. On 3 May 1947, at Hampstead register office, he married Christiane Amelie Pauline van het Kaar, formerly Kerbiriou, the former wife of Cornelius van het Kaar, and daughter of Emillieu Bailleux, of Calais. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In August 1947 Winskill was posted to Japan, with 17 squadron, part of the British component, Air Japan, serving there until April 1948 when sent to air headquarters, Malta. He then held a special appointment as air adviser to the Belgian government from December 1949, before returning to a series of UK postings at the Flying College, Manby, Stradishall, and Turnhouse. From June 1957 he was at the headquarters of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and in 1958 went to visit Felix Carron, the French farmboy who had helped him to evade capture&#151;a meeting he described as a &#145;very emotional moment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). By now a group captain, he was appointed to the staff of the air secretary then, promoted air commodore, served as air attach&eacute; in Paris. From August 1967 he was director of RAF public relations, a post held then by an officer with a distinctive and inspiring war record.<br>
<br>In February 1968 Winskill was appointed captain of the queen's flight, following the death of group captain J. H. L. Blount in a Whirlwind helicopter accident. He had the task of restoring confidence, helped by the acquisition of Wessex helicopters and Andovers, and was well liked by the royal family&#151;especially the queen mother&#151;for his charm and courtesy. Having been appointed CBE in 1960, he was appointed an extra equerry to the queen in 1968, CVO in 1973, and KCVO in 1980. He retired in 1982, and pursued his recreations of golf and bridge. Having lived latterly in Henley-on-Thames, he died in the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 9 August 2005, of pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis. He was survived by his wife, Christiane, and their daughter, his son having predeceased him.<br>
