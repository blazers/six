<span class="headword">Heriot,  John</span>  (1760&#150;1833), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and writer</span>, was born on 22 April 1760 in Haddington, East Lothian. His father was sheriff-clerk of East Lothian and he had an older brother, George (1759&#150;1839), later postmaster-general in Canada and travel writer. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1772, and Heriot attended Edinburgh high school. He began studying at Edinburgh University but had to leave in 1777 when his father's business failed. The family dispersed, and Heriot travelled to London, seeking a military commission. The army lists show that he was appointed second lieutenant in the marines on 13 November 1778 and was promoted to first lieutenant of the Plymouth division on 15 August 1781. He served on board the <i>Vengeance</i>, the <i>Preston</i>, and the <i>Elizabeth</i> off the coast of Africa and the West Indies. In the <i>Elizabeth</i> he was wounded in a battle on 17 April 1780 between the English fleet under Sir George B. Rodney and the French fleet under Admiral De Guichen. He transferred to the <i>Brune</i> frigate in July 1780 and was exposed to the hurricane that devastated Barbados on 10 October 1780. During the peace of Versailles in 1783 Heriot was put on half pay, which he mortgaged to help his parents, leaving him destitute.<br>
<br>Heriot turned to authorship, and wrote <span class="italic">The Sorrows of the Heart</span> in 1787 and a semi-autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">The Half-Pay Officer</span>, in 1789. He lived on the proceeds of these works for two years. At twenty-eight, on 29 May 1788 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, he married Alison Shiriff. The <span class="italic">Annual Biography</span> describes this as &#145;apparently a very imprudent step; but &hellip; a step of which he never had occasion to repent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>, 44). They had two daughters, and Heriot is described in this article as &#145;a kind and affectionate husband and father&#146;  (ibid., 50).<br>
<br>In 1788 Heriot was employed by Thomas Steele, secretary of the treasury, to write pamphlets and articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in support of the government. By 1791 he was one of the principal treasury writers and was awarded an annual salary of &pound;200. He was for a while on the staff of other treasury newspapers: <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> newspaper and then <span class="italic">The World</span>. In 1792, at the suggestion of Edmund Burke, and with the support of Pitt's ministry, Heriot established a newspaper designed to counteract &#145;the mischievous principles of revolutionary France&#146;  (Rose, 8.291). <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, a daily evening journal, appeared on 1 October 1792. It was covertly funded by the government ministers James Bland Burges and Charles Long. Within months it had a circulation of over four thousand copies daily, making it second only to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. This success has been attributed to the hundreds of copies bought and freely distributed by government. Heriot was then invited by George Rose, clerk of parliaments, to start the <span class="italic">True Briton</span>, a daily morning newspaper, on 1 January 1793. This paper took over the presses of the radical newspaper <span class="italic">Argus</span> after its closure by the government in December 1792. In this capacity Heriot's salary reached a height of &pound;2000. The <span class="italic">True Briton</span> continued for eleven years, and then suffered a &#145;financial crash&#146;  (Dean, 270). Heriot continued his literary career in these years. In 1792 he wrote <span class="italic">An Historical Sketch of Gibraltar</span>, a narrative to accompany the artist Poggi's drawing of the rock. Heriot's manuscript journal entry describing his presentation of this book to George III and Queen Charlotte is quoted in the <span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>. In 1798 he edited an <span class="italic">Account of the Battle of the Nile</span> from the notes of an officer present at the battle, which went through several editions.<br>
<br>In 1806 Heriot left the newspapers to accept the role of commissioner of the lottery. One biographer records this as an apt position for a &#145;born gambler&#146;  (Dean, 270). This contrasts with the character description in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of &#145;a straight-forward, honourable character, warm and zealous in his political principles and attachments&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 103/2, 1833, 184). In 1810 Heriot was made deputy paymaster-general of the troops in the Windward and Leeward Islands, and was stationed at Barbados. In 1816 the duke of York appointed him comptroller of Chelsea Hospital. Heriot died there from sudden paralysis on 29 July 1833, three days after his wife's death and a month after his daughter, who died in Trinidad on 30 June 1833. He was buried next to his wife in the burial-grounds of Chelsea Hospital, London, on 2 August 1833.<br>
