<span class="headword">Seyffert,  Christlieb Gottreich</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1757&#150;1764), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, may have come originally from Leipzig, and was first mentioned in London imprints in 1757. During that year he issued two catalogues, one in German and one in English, in which he described himself alternatively as a purveyor of &#145;neue teutsche B&uuml;cher, aus allen Wissenschaften&#146; (&#145;new German books in every branch of knowledge&#146;) or of &#145;new books lately imported in [the] French, Latin, and German languages, and in almost all faculties&#146;  (catalogues, formerly Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preussischer Kulturbesitz, now lost). Seyffert sent copies of these catalogues directly to potential customers with a signed printed letter soliciting orders, suggesting a determination to establish himself as a serious player in the foreign book market. Implicitly, he was announcing himself as a rival to Andreas Linde, already established in London as a bookseller and stationer, who was to give up his own business in the following year.<br>
<br>Early in 1757 Seyffert had acquired a substantial house &#145;at the corner of Kings Street in Dean Street opposite St Anns Church Soho&#146;  (letter, 13 May 1757, BL, Add. MS 4475, fol. 207). Within months of setting up his business, on 5 August 1757 he married Johanna-Maria Lieberich at St Anne, Soho. A daughter, Johanna Christina Elisabeth Seyffert, was born on 29 June 1758. In the same year Seyffert issued an English translation of Jan Swammerdam's <span class="italic">Bijbel der natuure</span>, an important contribution to early modern entomology, first published at Leiden in 1737 and 1738. The two substantial folio volumes of <span class="italic">The Book of Nature, or, The History of Insects</span>, which was edited by John Hill, were offered on a subscription basis with plates by the Hamburg engraver Johann Christian Gottfried Fritsch and clearly represented an ambitious and expensive initial project. Another publication of 1758, Madame de Fauques's political allegory <span class="italic">La derni&egrave;re guerre des b&ecirc;tes</span>, was to prove more characteristic of Seyffert's publishing activities in the longer term. Its apparent success ensured several further editions and sequels, an English translation, and finally the accolade of foreign pirated editions masquerading as Seyffert's own.<br>
<br>It was this topical and satirical vein that Seyffert decided to mine rather than the kind of expensive scientific publication represented by <span class="italic">The Book of Nature</span>. About 1760 Seyffert moved from Soho to premises &#145;at Homer's Head near St. Alban's Street in Pall Mall&#146;  (advertisement, <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span>, 20 May 1762). His publications in Pall Mall (chiefly in French and presumably aimed at the cosmopolitan and sophisticated market found in the area) included a French translation of George Lyttelton's <span class="italic">Dialogues of the Dead</span> (1760) and a bilingual edition of Nicolas-Joseph S&eacute;lis's <span class="italic">L'inoculation du bons sens</span> (&#145;or: an estimate of the present manners of the French nation&#146;, 1761). Other titles, for example <span class="italic">The Life and Opinions of Bertram Montfichet, Esq;</span>, were clearly intended to exploit the success of Laurence Sterne's <span class="italic">Tristram Shandy</span>, published by Robert Dodsley, a near neighbour of Seyffert in Pall Mall, in 1760.<br>
<br>A number of imported editions with cancel title-pages bearing Seyffert's imprint probably testify to links with the continental trade (for example with J. F. Bassompierre et fils at Louvain or Desaint et Saillant in Paris). More significant was Seyffert's presence from 1759, in succession to Linde, in the imprints of <span class="italic">Commentarii de rebus in scientia naturali et medicina gestis</span>, published annually by Johann Gottlieb Gleditsch at Leipzig. It was apparently this connection with the German trade that attracted the attention of Johann David Michaelis, a professor at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, who believed that Seyffert might fulfil a similar role as the London distributor of the university's own <span class="italic">Commentarii</span>. In a letter to Michaelis of 1761, however, the Hanoverian diplomat Wilhelm Philipp Best, who acted as G&ouml;ttingen's agent in London and was well acquainted with the London book trade, doubted whether Seyffert's business was financially secure enough to pay for the 100 copies G&ouml;ttingen hoped to sell in this way  (W. P. Best to J. D. Michaelis, <i>c</i>.1761, G&ouml;ttingen University library, cod. MS Mich. 320).<br>
<br>Best's concerns were justified; by 1762 Seyffert had clearly overreached himself and was obliged to sell his business and his entire stock (the sale was announced by Samuel Paterson in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> to take place over four successive days from 17 to 20 May 1762). In 1764 he was acting as attorney for Germans with claims on the British military resulting from the Seven Years' War. Although there is no further evidence for Seyffert's activities after 1764, his brief career as a foreign bookseller in the London book trade marks him out as an ambitious and innovative figure in a notoriously difficult market.<br>
