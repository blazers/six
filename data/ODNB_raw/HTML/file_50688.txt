<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Welensky, Sir  Roland <span class="st"> [Roy]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">prime minister of the federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland</span>, was born Raphael Welensky in Pioneer Street, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, on 20 January 1907, the thirteenth of fourteen children of Michael Welensky (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1843), boarding-house keeper, and his wife, Leah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ferreira (<i>c</i>.1865&#150;1918), an Afrikaner from Willowmore, Cape Colony, who was originally named Aletta, but had taken the name Leah on her marriage and conversion to Judaism.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Welensky's father had led a colourful if profligate life. Originally from Vilna, Lithuania, he had been an itinerant trader in Russia and a horse smuggler to both sides during the Franco-Prussian War, before roaming as a saloon keeper to the American mid-west. In 1881 he emigrated to Cape Colony. After losing another fortune in the ostrich feather trade, he and his family drifted to Southern Rhodesia, where he served in the Ndebele uprising. By 1907 he was running a hotel, effectively a doss house, in the poorest district of Salisbury, a world of white destitutes, drunkards, and prostitutes who lived cheek by jowl with Indians, &#145;coloureds&#146;, and Africans.<br>
<br>It was into such a world that Welensky was born, and this experience profoundly conditioned his character and political outlook. He frequently had to share beds with inebriated and poverty-stricken lodgers who often failed to pay the rent. This, together with his father's fondness for alcohol, made him a lifelong if not intolerant teetotaller. He mixed with all races from an early age, and boasted that he had not slept between sheets before he was sixteen. As he later famously stated in a BBC television interview, he swam &#145;bare-arsed in the Makabusi with many picannins&#146;  (Freeman, 12). He soon became aware of his Jewish ancestry, for at the lower end of white society Jews were often as disliked as Indians. &#145;I suffered the stigma of being a Jew&#146;, he later recalled, &#145;which one doesn't shed lightly in this world&#146;  (Freeman, 4). He attended the Salisbury primary school barefoot, where, because of his love of history and English, he was forced to defend himself against his peers' charge of being a swot. Fortunately he was a larger-than-average child with big fists, which stood him in good stead among Salisbury's roughest urchins.<br>
<br>In 1918 Welensky suffered a major blow with the death of his mother, who had been a crucial stabilizing figure. In 1921, having adopted the name Roland (though in fact he was known throughout his life as Roy), he left school to become a storeman in the farming and mining areas, in order to look after his elderly father, and also worked as a butcher, a baker, and a secondhand dealer's clerk. He was unable, however, to prevent his father's departure for an old people's home in Johannesburg, where he died alone. At seventeen Welensky moved to Bulawayo, becoming a locomotive fireman with Rhodesia Railways. He was two years under age, but the examining doctor was taken in by his 6 feet, 20 stone frame. He augmented his income by becoming a professional boxer and heavyweight champion of the Rhodesias by 1927. On 28 April 1928 he married Elizabeth Henderson (<i>c</i>.1911&#150;1969), a Bulawayo waitress, with whom he had two children, Joan and Michael. Soon after his marriage he was transferred to the Wankie coalfields, where, after a few successful bouts, he decided to retire from the ring.<h2>
<a name="Tradeunionist"></a>Trade unionist</h2>Soon after Welensky's arrival in Wankie the railway workers' union called a strike. Impressed by serious disunity in worker ranks, he became a popular and vocal critic of the railway bosses, who came to regard him as a troublemaker. He managed to keep his job, however, in spite of the world depression that hit the Rhodesian economy in 1931, unlike his brother Dave, prominent in the miners' union in Wankie, who had once been arrested for syndicalist activity in Johannesburg. Welensky helped his brother as well as keeping his wife and two children on a meagre shunter's wage, although he soon went into debt. In 1933, by then an engine driver, he was transferred to Broken Hill in Northern Rhodesia, where he was forced to use his fists against a virulently antisemitic combination of neo-Nazi Afrikaner and Mosleyite English-speaking white workers. He became convinced that only trade unionism on the British model would counter the fear and demoralization on which fascism bred. He faced down the fascist element and reorganized the railway workers' union in the town, becoming its branch chairman.<br>
<br>Acutely aware of his lack of formal education, Welensky embarked on an urgent programme of self-education, drawing eclectically on the writings of such figures as Marx, Mill, Bentham, Shakespeare, Disraeli, Conan Doyle, and Robert Service. He once described himself as &#145;a socialist conservative&#146;, preferring negotiations to strikes  (Taylor, 178). He nevertheless came to regard himself as &#145;the champion of the under-dog&#146; and organizer of the white working class against &#145;the boss class&#146;, at a time when the impact of the world depression was creating a growing class of poor whites in Northern Rhodesia. White worker insecurity was sharpened still further by the growing organization of African miners, who organized a significant strike on the copperbelt in 1935. Northern Rhodesia's racially divided labour practices resembled those of Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa, but its white settlers lacked the self-governing institutions of their southern counterparts, resenting the vulnerability of the territory's government to Colonial Office directives and metropolitan humanitarian opinion.<h2>
<a name="Politician"></a>Politician</h2>Welensky's ambitions now turned to the political sphere. In 1938 he was elected unopposed as member of the legislative council for Broken Hill. He developed an unlikely but intimate political alliance with Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart Gore-Browne, patrician leader of the unofficial members, based on their common faith in the colony's economic future and opposition to what they regarded as Colonial Office high-handedness. Gore-Browne, moreover, was aware of Welensky's great sway with the white miners and railwaymen, an influence Welensky strengthened by forming the Northern Rhodesian Labour Party in 1941. He also co-founded a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Northern News</span>, which became highly successful. The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, moreover, further enhanced his stature. Avowedly anti-fascist, he tried to join the army but was regarded as too vital to the Northern Rhodesian war effort. He became a member of the executive council (1940&#150;53) and in 1941 was appointed director of manpower, a pivotal position at a time when the copperbelt, crucial to the war effort, was vulnerable to strikes organized by a bizarre alliance of communist and neo-fascist white workers. He was also appointed a member of Sir John Foster's commission of inquiry into the riots on the copperbelt. He served on various railway arbitration tribunals. In these positions he did much to moderate white worker opinion during wartime.<br>
<br>In 1946 Welensky succeeded Gore-Browne to the powerful position of leader of the unofficial members. He had two chief political objectives: to force the British South Africa Company to relinquish its mineral rights to the Northern Rhodesia government, and the amalgamation of the colony with self-governing Southern Rhodesia, building on close wartime inter-territorial co-operation. After years of tough negotiations, he succeeded in the first cause, resulting in huge revenues for the Northern Rhodesia government. This success strengthened his determination to gain amalgamation. At the end of the war, however, aware of the growing international mood against racism and colonialism, neither main political party at Westminster could countenance a wholesale transfer of the African population of a protectorate to the white-dominated and self-governing Southern Rhodesia, with its segregationist racial policies. The British government made clear that it would only permit a federation of the Rhodesias provided Nyasaland was added, and that the existing forms of government would continue in all three territories. Thus, ministers hoped, a pro-British dominion would eventually evolve as a counterbalance to the increasingly segregationist and republican-leaning Union of South Africa, as well as forestall any advance of communism in the region.<br>
<br>Welensky played a leading part in the negotiations leading to federation, including the Victoria Falls conference of 1951, where he developed close links with the Southern Rhodesian prime minister Sir Godfrey Huggins (who had attended his mother in her last illness), becoming a leading member of his United Federal Party. In London, Labour ministers warmed to his Bevin-like working-class bluntness. The federation that came into existence in 1953 was amazingly complicated, involving five different governments. Britain dealt with the federation and Southern Rhodesia through the Commonwealth Relations Office, while the two northern territories came under the Colonial Office, which enjoyed mutually antagonistic relations with the Commonwealth Relations Office. Welensky's role in the creation of the federation was rewarded with a knighthood (1953), and cabinet rank, as minister of transport, communications, and posts (1953&#150;6), and concurrently leader of the house and deputy prime minister (1955&#150;6). Despite their different backgrounds, Huggins rated Welensky highly as a &#145;first-rate colleague [with] &hellip; a first-class brain and lots of commonsense&#146;  (Taylor, 175).<h2>
<a name="Federalprimeminister"></a>Federal prime minister</h2>On 1 November 1956, ominously coinciding with the Suez operation, Welensky succeeded Huggins (now Lord Malvern) as prime minister, minister of external affairs, and (until 1959) minister of defence. One of his first actions was to express the federation's support for the Anglo-French action. He declared:<blockquote>[W]hatever the course of events may prove to be, our loyalty to the Crown is unquestioned. As a people whether white or black, we are British, and we are determined that this will not change, whatever our status within the Commonwealth may become. (Leys, 247)</blockquote>His Britishness, in spite of his lack of British blood, was a sincere boast that he returned to again and again. &#145;I'm probably old fashioned&#146;, he once told the speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons, &#145;but I am not ashamed of the word Empire&#146;  (Welensky to Sir Norman Strong, 8 Feb 1955, Bodl. RH, Welensky papers 674/3). He distinguished, however, between &#145;the imperial mission&#146; and the actions of British governments, likening the determination of the Rhodesians to that of the American colonists of 1776. &#145;I, of course, have no loyalty to your Government whatsoever&#146;, he reminded Malcolm Muggeridge. &#145;But I have a loyalty to the Crown. We look upon the Queen as the Queen of the Federation&#146;  (Muggeridge, 3). Welensky belonged to the old Commonwealth of white dominions, led by familiar figures such as Sir Robert Menzies, to whom Welensky seemed &#145;addicted to plain speech&#146;  (R. Menzies, <span class="italic">Afternoon Light</span>, 1967, 215).<br>
<br>Welensky anticipated that his country would achieve dominion status following the federal review conference due in 1960, but the federation had been fatally flawed from the outset, having been driven through in the face of African opposition, particularly in the two northern territories. Northern Rhodesian Africans in particular felt, with good reason, that Southern Rhodesia was being built up with northern copper revenues. Nyasaland Africans, regarding their territory as the Cinderella of the federation, shared the belief that federation represented the northward extension of Southern Rhodesian segregationism. Both regarded federal reforms such as the removal of petty discrimination and the admission of Africans to senior positions in parliament and the civil and diplomatic services as mere tokenism, particularly as Southern Rhodesia remained a bastion of white supremacy. External factors did not favour Welensky's imperial vision. The Suez crisis was followed by the independence of Ghana, whose leader, Kwame Nkrumah, made clear that African nationalism would soon triumph throughout the continent. The rapid decolonization of much of French Africa was followed by the crisis in the former Belgian Congo, in which Welensky backed the secessionist state of Katanga. He was suspected, absurdly, of arranging the death of the UN secretary-general Dag Hammarskj&ouml;ld in an air crash in Northern Rhodesia in 1960.<br>
<br>In 1958 Welensky won significant concessions, including greater devolution in external affairs and an undertaking not to intervene legislatively except at the request of the federal government, from the British government, which shared his fear of the right-wing Dominion Party opposition. For him the attraction of foreign investment and immigration were priorities, along with re-equipping the army and air force with sophisticated weaponry. Within the federation itself, however, he was swimming against the tide of African opinion. By 1958&#150;9 it became clear that in all three territories this was hardening. The replacement of Garfield Todd by Sir Edgar Whitehead as Southern Rhodesian prime minister seemed to portend a rightward and anti-federation tendency in an electorate on which Welensky crucially depended. He responded to manifestations of African nationalism largely by believing that African unrest could be contained by economic rather than political progress. In Nyasaland a state of emergency, which he supported with federal troops, failed to curtail the strength of Dr Hastings Banda. The report of the Devlin commission into the disturbances, with its damning conclusion that the territory was a &#145;police state&#146;, combined with revelations about the Kenyan Hola camp &#145;massacre&#146; of Mau Mau detainees, alienated still further metropolitan opinion. Welensky none the less enjoyed strong support within the right of the Conservative Party, led by the vociferous if declining marquess of Salisbury.<br>
<br>In the closing years of the federation Welensky was diplomatically outclassed by British ministers. He was encouraged to present complicated British reforms of the Northern Rhodesian and Nyasaland electoral systems as final, only to find that these positions were soon abandoned in favour of accelerated progress towards majority rule and secession. He felt particularly deceived by the Monckton report which, though favourable to the economic aspects of federation, made major recommendations about alterations in the territorial and federal franchises and suggested that the British government clarify the territorial right to secession. He would have been reluctant to see Nyasaland withdraw, because of the precedent it set, but on the retention of Northern Rhodesia he seemed resolute. He made preparations for a federal unilateral declaration of independence, including, it was said, a plan to kidnap the Northern Rhodesian governor, but the absence of direct British military provocation, together with the difficulty of effecting a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> over so vast an area, undermined his threat. First Nyasaland and then Northern Rhodesia, under Banda and Kenneth Kaunda respectively, were given the right to secede. By then the future of Welensky's federal ideal had been fatally compromised in any case by the election in Southern Rhodesia in 1962 of the white supremacist and anti-federalist Rhodesian Front. Welensky blamed Macmillan and Iain Macleod for this betrayal, when in fact Rab Butler, the minister for central Africa whom he admired, was a reluctant if resolute architect of this policy. Welensky's last-minute proposal to detach the copperbelt and &#145;line of rail&#146; and amalgamate them with Southern Rhodesia, as well as British promises to maintain some sort of economic association, came to nothing. Nevertheless, he co-operated fully in the orderly winding up of the federation in 1963, transferring the bulk of the powerful federal armed forces to Southern Rhodesia, a crucial factor in the unilateral declaration of independence crisis that followed after November 1965.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>In 1964 Welensky decided to stand for the Southern Rhodesian assembly, as leader of the Rhodesia National Party (successor to the United Federal Party), but Clifford Dupont of the Rhodesian Front in a heated by-election defeated him. During the campaign extreme Rhodesian Front supporters branded him &#145;a bloody Jew&#146;, a &#145;communist&#146;, and a &#145;traitor&#146;  (Blake, 388). When the unilateral declaration of independence came in November 1965 he opposed it as unjustified, believing that Ian Smith made a fatal error in consulting the unenfranchised majority on the issue (by means of an indaba), thus making this a principle in any future Anglo-Rhodesian negotiations. Nevertheless he advised Rhodesians to prevent chaos by obeying their &#145;revolutionary government&#146;  (Joyce, 285). In 1969 he opposed Smith's moves towards a republic, but supported acceptance of the Anglo-Rhodesian settlement in the Pearce commission of 1971.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife in 1969, Welensky married, in 1972, (Miriam) Valerie Scott, a British Conservative Party worker thirty years his junior, with whom he had two daughters. He declined offers of safe Conservative seats in Britain, just as he had refused a peerage on the dissolution of the federation. He enjoyed an extensive correspondence with such figures as Desmond Donnelly, maverick Labour MP for Pembroke, sharing Donnelly's disillusionment with post-imperial Britain. Personally incorruptible, the only public pension he drew was &pound;9 a year as a former railwayman. In 1981, his health failing, he retired to Blandford Forum in Dorset. He died at Blandford Hospital, Blandford Forum, on 5 December 1991 following a heart attack, and was survived by his second wife, their two daughters, and the two children of his first marriage.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Born into the direst poverty, Welensky experienced acutely the insecurities of the white minorities of central and southern Africa. Yet he enjoyed warm personal relations with individual Africans, including Kenneth Kaunda. Among his most treasured possessions was an African bust presented to him by a fellow freemason, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. According to Margaret West, a British diplomat stationed in the federation, Welensky was &#145;so nearly a great man&#146;. To have risen from grinding privation to such political influence was an achievement in itself. It is not surprising that he failed to preserve the federation, a cause that would have defeated statesmen born into far more fortunate circumstances.<br>
