<span class="headword">Osman</span>, Efendi <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>William Thomson]</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1800, <em>d.</em> 1835), <span class="occ">guide to travellers in Egypt</span>, was originally William Thomson, a native of Scotland. Details of his life, gleaned from passing remarks by the many travellers who knew him in Cairo, are scant and occasionally contradictory. This sometimes leads to confusion, as with Osman's original identity: he signed his name both as William Thomson and as William Taylor, and he has been misidentified by others as Donald Thomson and Donald Donald.<br>
<br>Thomson enlisted in the 78th highlanders, a regiment that was sent to Egypt in 1807 as part of an unsuccessful expedition to suppress Mehmet Ali's newly established regime. Captured in a disastrous rear-guard action at Rosetta, Thomson was sold into slavery; he was subsequently compelled to profess Islam, forcibly circumcised, and given the name Osman. Though his initial years of servitude were harsh, his skills, including a reputation for medical knowledge, earned him better treatment. When he was making the <i>hajj</i>, or pilgrimage, in Arabia in 1814&#150;15 Osman met the celebrated Swiss traveller John Louis Burckhardt, who later persuaded the British consul-general in Egypt, Henry Salt, to arrange Osman's freedom. A good businessman, Osman took an inheritance from a former master and managed it so successfully as to achieve affluence. He rose high in Egypt's &eacute;lite Turkish society and was accorded the title of efendi, or gentleman. Hence it is not surprising that he refused to return to Scotland, though many of his British acquaintances encouraged him to do so. Osman also became a <i>dragoman</i>, or interpreter, at the British consulate in Cairo, but his lifestyle, manners, and religion remained thoroughly Eastern. He had several wives, sometimes concurrently, but no details of them are known.<br>
<br>What brought Osman to the attention of so many British travellers in Egypt was his function as an intermediary between them and Egyptian society. As increasing numbers of British arrived in Egypt during the early nineteenth century, they frequently sought out Osman for aid in dealing with the myriad aspects of Eastern life, there being scant support services for travellers in those days. His help, for which he received commissions, was considered essential: &#145;In short&#146;, one traveller wrote, &#145;nothing is to be accomplished without Osman, who keeps the rogues in order&#146;  (Hay, fol. 37). Osman performed a great service to scholarship by helping the informal group of British orientalists and Egyptologists that assembled in Egypt during the early nineteenth century, a group that included Edward William Lane, Sir Gardner Wilkinson, Robert Hay, Joseph Bonomi, Frederick Catherwood, James Burton, Algernon Percy (Baron Prudhoe, who later became the fourth duke of Northumberland), Major Orlando Felix, and others. Without Osman, it is difficult to see how they could have accomplished as much as they did.<br>
<br>Osman Efendi died from dysentery on 8 November 1835 at his home in Suq al-Khushab, Cairo. His adherence to Islam had always fascinated his British acquaintances, many of whom doubted his sincerity, but in his final hours Osman refused Christian attention and died as a Muslim. He was buried shortly after his death in Cairo's Bab al-Nasir cemetery in the grave of his friend J. L. Burckhardt.<br>
