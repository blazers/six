<span class="headword">Armytage,  (Walter) Harry Green</span>  (1915&#150;1998), <span class="occ">educationist and historian</span>, was born on 22 November 1915 at 179 du Toitspan Road, Kimberley, South Africa, the son of Walter Green Armytage (1880&#150;1934), a railway clerk, and his wife, Harriet Jane May (1894&#150;1964). He was brought up initially in Bloemfontein, South Africa, but in 1924 he moved with his family to England. He attended Basset Road Boys' School in Camborne, and then, from 1927 until 1934, Redruth county grammar school, Cornwall. From 1934 to 1938 he went on to study at Downing College, Cambridge, where he took first-class honours in history and a certificate in education. He embarked on a teaching career as a history master at Dronfield grammar school, Sheffield. After the outbreak of the Second World War he served in the army as a captain in the London Irish Rifles, in north Africa and Italy, and was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Following the war Armytage returned to Dronfield, but in 1946 he moved to the University of Sheffield as a lecturer in education. On 25 June 1948 he married (Lucy) Frances Horsfall (1912&#150;1996). Frances, also a historian, had been in the civil service during the war and later became a lecturer in history at the University of Sheffield. They settled in Totley, Sheffield, where they had a son, John, and remained there for the rest of their long marriage.<br>
<br>Once established at the university, Armytage soon became widely recognized as a formidable scholar. He rose rapidly to become senior lecturer in 1952, and two years later was promoted to professor of education. His published work presented the history of education in England in terms of gradual progress towards a rational, scientific, and civilized society. Much of his early work was biographical in nature, and he completed full-length studies of A. J. Mundella (1951), Thomas Hughes (with E. C. Mack, 1952), and Sir Richard Gregory (1957). He emphasized what he saw as the English liberal tradition of education, &#145;a tradition of reasonableness, tolerance, compromise and humanity&#146; that also evoked service and industry: &#145;the service which was perfect freedom, and the industry which was life itself&#146;  (W. H. G. Armytage, <span class="italic">A. J. Mundella</span>, 1951, 13).<br>
<br>This liberal idealism also informed Armytage's important writings on the English civic universities, which he depicted as &#145;parceners of a great heritage &hellip; centres of creative endeavour in the arts and sciences, repositories of informed knowledge and opinion, powerhouses of ideas, nurseries of new disciplines&#146;  (W. H. G. Armytage, <span class="italic">Civic Universities: Aspects of a British Tradition</span>, 1955, 311). He insisted that the structures developed under the 1870 <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> were essentially benevolent and progressive in their design. He also cultivated a strongly international dimension in his work, reflected increasingly in his comparative studies, especially in demonstrating the international influences of ideas and movements.<br>
<br>In the early 1960s Armytage cemented his reputation among educationists and historians alike with four books that were the key defining works of a mature scholar. Each of these traced the origins of major educational and social movements over many centuries. The first was <span class="italic">A Social History of Engineering</span> (1961), which went into several editions. This was followed by <span class="italic">Heavens below</span> (1961), a study of utopian experiments in England from 1560 to 1960, commissioned as one of a series of studies in social history. The third was <span class="italic">Four Hundred Years of English Education</span> (1964), an overview of educational developments since the Elizabethan era. Lastly, <span class="italic">The Rise of the Technocrats</span> (1965) examined the international influence of scientific expertise from the seventeenth century onwards. In the later 1960s he also contributed a series of short works to the <span class="roman">Students Library of Education</span> series on different national influences on English education: the American (1967), the French (1968), the German (1969), and the Russian (1969). At the same time he developed the millenarian aspect of his historical work through a further book entitled <span class="italic">Yesterday's Tomorrows</span> (1968).<br>
<br>Armytage's position as the leading historian of education in England was somewhat undermined after this time, as the field turned towards more critical, less sympathetic accounts, and as he became increasingly involved in university administration. He served as pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Sheffield from 1964 until 1968, and became the first dean of the faculty of educational studies in 1970. He was also involved in many committees, as well as in societies in which he took a personal interest, such as the Eugenics Society (later the Galton Institute), and was an avid follower in his spare time of Sheffield United Football Club.<br>
<br>Throughout, Armytage was a lively and inspiring teacher, as well as an engaging, gregarious colleague. He was a champion of the teaching profession and of the aspirations of individual teachers for continued professional development, and often gave talks to professional associations and at school prize-givings. He also strongly supported the History of Education Society (founded in 1967), served on its executive committee, and played a leading part in its conferences, with regular lectures and after-dinner speeches. He helped to establish a successful exchange scheme with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and spent two years after his retirement in 1981 as the Gerald Read professor of education at Kent State University in Ohio. His contributions were recognized with the award of honorary degrees at the University of Ulster (1977), the University of Hull (DLitt, 1980), and the University of Sheffield (DLitt, 1991).<br>
<br>In his last years Armytage fell victim to Alzheimer's disease. He died at his home, 3 The Green, Totley, following a cardiac arrest on 13 June 1998, and was cremated on 19 June. Harry Armytage's contribution to his field of study continued to be admired as outstanding, and indeed he may well be regarded as one of the finest of all English historians of education. The Harry Armytage memorial awards are offered by the University of Sheffield to support research into the history of education and comparative education.<br>
