<span class="headword">Ganga Govind Singh</span> <span class="st"> [Ganga Gobinda Sinha]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1750&#150;1795), <span class="occ">revenue administrator in Bengal</span>, wielded great power and influence under Warren Hastings, accumulating in the process a huge fortune which enabled his descendants to become one of the most notable families in nineteenth-century Bengal. He was one of four sons of Bihari Singh, a silk merchant and descendant of a Kayastha family, settled at Kandi near Murshidabad, the capital of Mughal Bengal. Members of his family were engaged in trade and revenue administration under the nawabs of Bengal. Ganga Govind Singh was adopted by his uncle Gouranga Singh, and he and his elder brother Radhakanta were brought up as <i>kanungos</i>, keepers of revenue records.<br>
<br>When the East India Company took control of the Bengal revenues in 1765, they urgently needed the expertise of men like Ganga Govind Singh. By 1771 he was being employed in the company's central treasury, and in 1773 became <i>diwan</i>, or agent, to a committee managing the revenues of the Calcutta area. By then he had attracted the notice of Warren Hastings, who appointed him in 1778 to a commission to survey the revenue resources of Bengal and in 1781 made him <i>diwan</i> to a committee responsible for the revenue of the whole province. The next four years, until Hastings left Bengal in 1785, were the apogee of Ganga Govind Singh's career. Hastings paid both public and private tributes to his &#145;fidelity, diligence, and ability&#146; and to his faithful support of the governor-general  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 440). Hastings's enemy Philip Francis called Ganga Govind Singh &#145;prime minister to Mr Hastings and I believe the only man he really trusts&#146;  (MS Eur. G5, p. 431). It was said that he &#145;was looked upon by the natives as the second person in the government, if not the first&#146;  (Marshall, 112). All the great <i>zamindars</i> (revenue payers) in Bengal felt obliged to deal with the government through him and it is clear that they had to pay heavily for his favour. There was said to be &#145;hardly a Native family of credit &hellip; whom he has not some time or other distressed or afflicted&#146;, or a <i>zamindar</i>'s estate &#145;that he has not dismembered and plundered&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 442). He built up an enormous fortune, estimated at over &pound;3 million by 1785  (Marshall, 112), and acquired much land.<br>
<br>There were, however, dangers in being the governor-general's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, since Hastings's enemies also became Ganga Govind Singh's enemies. As soon as Hastings had left India, charges were laid against Ganga Govind Singh, which he fought off, but he felt obliged to resign in 1786. At Hastings's impeachment Edmund Burke excoriated Ganga Govind Singh for his &#145;wickedness, barbarity and corruption&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 443). Ganga Govind Singh appealed to the new governor-general, Lord Cornwallis, for further employment: &#145;From the first establishment of the Company I have been in their Service and expended my Life&#146;  (Cornwallis MSS, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/11/12, fol. 352). The climate of opinion among the British had, however, turned irrevocably against men like him. He retired to his family lands at Kandi, where he lived the life of a devout Vaishnavite Hindu, distributing his wealth in acts of piety, founding temples, giving alms to Brahmans and pilgrims, and performing a spectacular <i>sraddha</i> (memorial festival) for his mother, said to have cost &pound;200,000. Hastings in retirement received occasional reports about Ganga Govind Singh, the last apparently being a message of congratulation in 1795 on the ending of Hastings's impeachment. The date and manner of his death are unknown. His son Santiram Singh, also active in revenue business and as the personal agent of prominent Europeans, predeceased him. Ganga Govind Singh then adopted Santiram's son Prankrishna Singh, who also became a <i>kanungo</i> and acted as his adopted father's deputy. Ganga Govind Singh's descendants came to be known as the Paikpara family, the name of their great house in Calcutta.<br>
