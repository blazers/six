<span class="headword">Bonomi,  Joseph</span>  (1796&#150;1878), <span class="occ">sculptor and Egyptologist</span>, and his twin sister, Mary Anne Bonomi (1796&#150;1872), were born at 76 Great Titchfield Street, London, on 9 October 1796, the eighth and ninth but fourth and fifth surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2857/', "Joseph (Giuseppe) Bonomi (1739&#150;1808)")</script>, architect, and Rosa Florini (1755&#150;1812). Bonomi was baptized four days later in the Venetian Chapel in London, when his sponsors (by proxy) were Giovanni Carlo Bonomi, his uncle, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15188/', "Angelica Kauffman")</script>, his mother's cousin. Bonomi's parents died when he was young but comfortable provision was made for the children. He attended school at Carshalton, Surrey. By 1815, when the Society of Arts awarded him a silver medal for a bas-relief in plaster, Bonomi's thoughts were turning to sculpture, and in 1816 he joined the Royal Academy Schools, where the sculptor John Flaxman was his teacher; he won silver medals there in 1817 and 1818. About 1818 he became the pupil of Joseph Nollekens and in 1819 executed a monument to Captain Showers for Calcutta Cathedral. He eventually tired of the discipline of assisting the elderly Nollekens and in 1822 decided to go to Rome to study under Antonio Canova, who, however, died before his arrival.<br>
<br>In Rome, Bonomi soon became part of the British artistic community, meeting among other artists Charles Eastlake, John Gibson, Joseph John Scoles, and Frederick Catherwood. In an echo of his father's early career he turned aside from his sculptor's training and in 1824 joined Robert Hay's expedition to Egypt as a salaried artist. In 1825 Hay made a journey up the Nile to Abu Simbel, Philae, and Thebes, and on this trip Bonomi produced numerous drawings and helped to make casts at Kalabsha, the largest of which are in the British Museum. On a second visit to Thebes in 1826 Hay and Bonomi saw the temple of Hermopolis just before it was demolished. Bonomi quarrelled with Hay over ownership of his drawings and parted from him in the summer of 1826. He spent 1827&#150;8 in Cairo producing engravings for James Burton's <span class="italic">Excerpta hieroglyphica</span>; he lived for a time in Thebes and formed a great friendship with the Italian traveller Rosselini; in 1830&#150;31 he travelled in Egypt with two French artists, Linant and Dupuy; and in 1832 he was reconciled with Hay and worked with the architectural draughtsman and painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/712/', "Francis Arundale")</script>. In a letter dated 9 August 1832 from Thebes, Arundale noted that &#145;Bonomi and I live in the same tomb&#146;  (Vialla, 114), an abode he recorded in a letter and sketch (14 August 1832) of which he stated that &#145;the person entering the door is Bonomi in his habitual dress&#146;  (ibid., 115&#150;16). While in Egypt, Bonomi formed a liaison with a woman called Fatima, with whom he had two children. In August 1833 Bonomi toured Palestine and Syria with Arundale and the draughtsman and printmaker Frederick Catherwood. Bonomi, mistaken for a native, having adopted Eastern dress, assumed Eastern manners, and learned Arabic, was one of the first Europeans to visit the Dome of the Rock (or the mosque of Omar), but Catherwood, posing as a military engineer, entered soon after, and both claimed credit for producing the detailed drawings which James Fergusson used in his <span class="italic">Essay on the Ancient Topography of Jerusalem</span> (1847) when he asserted that the Dome of the Rock covered the holy sepulchre (an assertion demolished by Robert Willis in his treatise on the holy sepulchre in 1849).<br>
<br>Bonomi returned to England some time after 1834 and was employed in illustrating the Egyptian works of John Gardner Wilkinson and Samuel Birch, and in helping to arrange the Egyptian exhibits in the British Museum, but he failed to find the regular employment which his family hoped would be his. In 1838 he went to Rome to copy the hieroglyphics and obelisks there. In 1842 he was asked to provide designs for an Egyptian fa&ccedil;ade for John Marshall's Temple Mills at Leeds. This monumental fa&ccedil;ade, based on the temple of Edfu, might have established Bonomi's architectural reputation. (Indeed, his designs for the mill later formed his chief claim to be an architect.) He decided, however, to join the Prussian government's expedition to Egypt led by Dr Karl Richard Lepsius. The invitation was the result of a chance meeting with the Prussian crown prince, Alexander von Humboldt, the Prussian ambassador Baron von Bunsen, and Lepsius in the British Museum, and Bonomi had only two days to prepare to sail, leaving Ignatius, his more prudent brother, to negotiate the details of his contract and remuneration. Bonomi spent two years in Egypt, measuring and drawing, and returned to England in 1844. In 1850 he went into partnership with Henry Warren and James Fahey and made a series of drawings which Warren and Fahey painted as a <span class="italic">Grand Moving Panorama of the Nile</span>, which was at first profitable but which finally ran into financial difficulties from which Bonomi was extricated with Ignatius Bonomi's help.<br>
<br>In 1845 Bonomi married Jessie Martin (1825&#150;1859), daughter of the artist John Martin, with whom he had four children: Joseph Menes (<i>b</i>. 1846), Cautley (<i>b</i>. 1847), Jessie (<i>b</i>. 1849), and John (<i>b</i>. 1851); but in a devastating week in April 1852 all four died of whooping cough. Four more children followed: Isabella (<i>b</i>. 1853), Cecilia Nefeeseh (1855&#150;1944), Joseph Ignatius (1857&#150;1930), and Marion (1859&#150;1887); but in 1859 Jessie Bonomi died, aged thirty-four. Thereafter Jessie's sister Isabella Mary Martin kept house for Bonomi and helped to raise his family.<br>
<br>In 1853 Bonomi had a notable success in assisting Owen Jones in the arrangement of the Egyptian court at the Crystal Palace; much of the modelling was executed by Bonomi himself. Among those whom he advised on their collections of Egyptian and other antiquities were John Lee of Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire, Henry Abbott, the earl of Ashburnham, the marquess of Northampton, and, notably, the duke of Northumberland, who as Lord Prudhoe had been one of the group of Egyptological enthusiasts in the 1820s and 1830s. In 1861 the curatorship of Sir John Soane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London fell vacant. A practising architect had to be appointed; and after fierce struggle and controversy Bonomi, who, but for the work which he had done for John Marshall in Leeds, would have found it impossible to prove his qualification for the post, overcame his critics and was elected. The curatorship at last gave him a permanent salary, and he and his brother Ignatius purchased land at Wimbledon Park, Surrey, and built a house in Princes Road, The Camels, which Joseph adorned with a frieze of a caravan, representing the path of life. In 1864 he published remarkably detailed drawings of the Soane Museum's &#145;Belzoni sarcophagus&#146; of Seti I, king of Egypt, with descriptions by Samuel Sharpe. In 1867 he designed the first hieroglyphic font to be produced in England, for the illustration of Birch's hieroglyphic dictionary. The Soane Museum post suited him, and he remained there until his death at The Camels on 3 March 1878. He was buried with his wife and first family in the Brompton cemetery, London, &#145;beneath a guardian Anubis&#146;  (Tillett).<br>
<br>Bonomi's scholarship was shown in articles on Egypt which he contributed to the principal publications of the time, especially the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature</span>; and his artistry was expressed in his illustrations for other people's works. One of the foremost hieroglyphic draughtsmen of his day, his work can be found in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Syro-Egyptian Society</span>; the <span class="italic">Gallery of Antiquities Selected from the British Museum</span>, by Francis Arundale and Bonomi (1842&#150;3), with descriptions by Samuel Birch; his catalogues of Robert Hay's collection; and John Lee's collection in the Hartwell House Museum. Bonomi frequently collaborated with Samuel Sharpe especially, illustrating most of Sharpe's books; in many cases it would be more correct to say that Sharpe supplied the text explaining Bonomi's drawings. Bonomi's major publication was <span class="italic">Nineveh and its Palaces</span>, a popular and scholarly work which regarded the city from the artistic and scriptural points of view and illustrated and discussed in depth the chief sculptures, reliefs, and inscriptions then known of that city; the work ran through several editions from 1852. Bonomi also invented a machine for measuring the proportions of the body and wrote a treatise on the proportions of the human figure. Samuel Birch, Egyptologist and keeper of oriental antiquities at the British Museum:<blockquote>praised his abilities &hellip; considering him to have greater knowledge of Egypt than anyone else of the period save Wilkinson; the number of works and projects he contributed to after 1830 was enormous and exceeded that of any other artist, so that although not an Egyptologist he yet made greater contributions than most. (Dawson and Uphill, 54)</blockquote>
