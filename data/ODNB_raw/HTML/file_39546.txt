<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heinemann,  Margot Claire</span>  (1913&#150;1992), <span class="occ">writer and teacher</span>, was born on 18 November 1913 at 89 Priory Road, Hampstead, London, the second daughter of Meyer Max Heinemann, a merchant banker, and Selma Schott, a non-Orthodox Jewish couple recently immigrated from Frankfurt, Germany. An only brother was born four years later. Margot Heinemann was educated at South Hampstead high school, King Alfred School, and, finally, Roedean, where in 1931 she won a major scholarship to read English at Newnham College, Cambridge. She gained a double first and was awarded a one-year research studentship.<br>
<br>During her undergraduate days, at the time of the depression and Hitler's rise to power, Heinemann first became intensely interested in politics and joined the socialist club and, after the passage of a contingent of hunger marchers through Cambridge in February 1934, the Communist Party. In its ranks she met and in 1935 started a relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37313/', "(Rupert) John Cornford (1915&#150;1936)")</script>, an energetic student leader and poet. Only three weeks after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 Cornford travelled to Spain and enlisted in a republican militia, leaving behind an anguished Margot Heinemann, who wrote the first of several poems inspired by the Spanish Civil War, &#145;For R.J.C. (summer, 1936)&#146;. Cornford returned safely on this occasion, but only to recruit more volunteers for the republican cause, with whom he set out again in October 1936, this time to join the newly formed International Brigades on what turned out to be a fatal mission. On the news of his death in action towards the end of 1936 Heinemann bravely responded with another poem, &#145;Grieve in a New Way for New Losses&#146;, which balances a reassuring refrain, &#145;All this is not more than we can deal with&#146;, against deeply pained verses:<blockquote>
<div>To think he lies out there, and changes<br>
</div>
<div>In the process of the earth from what I knew,<br>
</div>
<div>Decays and even there in the grave, shut close<br>
</div>
<div>In the dark, away from me, speechless and cold.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Heinemann's &#145;For R.J.C.&#146; had been reciprocated by Cornford in an untitled poem composed in the Aragon trenches, which begins &#145;Heart of the heartless world&#146;. It was addressed to Margot Heinemann and for decades circulated, especially in the communist countries of eastern Europe, as &#145;To Margot Heinemann&#146;, following its publication under this title in <span class="italic">John Cornford: a Memoir</span> (1938). Heinemann's poems were first published alongside Cornford's dedicatory one in John Lehmann's magazine <span class="italic">New Writing</span> in autumn 1937.<br>
<br>Heinemann's first employment was as a teacher for factory girls in a day continuation school at Bourneville. She left in 1937 to join the staff of the Labour Research Department in London, where for the next twelve years she inquired into wage structures in the various industries, wartime production, and British trade policy. She also lectured to trade unionists, coalminers in particular. Among the journalistic work undertaken during this time and mostly published in <span class="italic">Labour Research</span> and <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span>, sometimes under the pen-name Margaret Hudson, the frequent articles and books on the conditions in the coalmining industry stand out. In <span class="italic">Britain's Coal</span> (1944), a Left Book Club choice prompted by the fuel shortage of the war years, she argued the case for pit nationalization, and in <span class="italic">Coal must Come First</span> (1948) she reviewed the progress made since the passing of the industry into public ownership. The mood of the country that put the Labour Party in power in 1945 and prepared the way for the nationalization of key industries is well captured in Heinemann's only novel, <span class="italic">The Adventurers</span> (1960), set in a fictitious &#145;mid-Welsh coalfield&#146;.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1940s Heinemann contributed to the communist press, and towards the end of that decade moved closer to the centre of communist politics by working full-time for the party, among other things as a researcher and speech-writer for its general secretary Harry Pollitt. She served on the editorial board of the party's intellectual journal the <span class="italic">Modern Quarterly</span> (1945&#150;53), and edited the weekly <span class="italic">World News and Views</span> from 1949 to 1951, and its literary supplement <span class="italic">Daylight</span> (1952&#150;3), which promoted working-class writing. By standing as the Communist candidate for the Lambeth and Vauxhall division in the general election of 1950 and polling just over 500 votes (a mere 1.3 per cent of the votes cast) she experienced the hopeless isolation into which the Communist Party was drifting as a result of the developing cold war. However, this did not deter her from supporting the leadership's unquestioning adoption of Soviet cultural policies (Zhdanovism) in all the crucial inner-party debates of those years. In the &#145;Caudwell discussion&#146;, for example, conducted in the <span class="italic">Modern Quarterly</span> in 1950&#150;51, she sided with Maurice Cornforth, who had launched the assault on Christopher Caudwell's unorthodox aesthetics. In this unwavering pro-Soviet stance and demand for orthodoxy she was at one with her partner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30813/', "(John) Desmond Bernal (1901&#150;1971)")</script>, the eminent scientist and an international celebrity in the world communist movement owing to his indefatigable work for the World Peace Council and the World Federation of Scientific Workers.<br>
<br>The couple had begun a relationship in 1949. After the birth of their daughter Jane in 1953 Heinemann did not resume full-time party work. But even as a rank-and-file member she remained alert to the debates about the Stalinization of the party and was unsympathetic towards the intellectuals who left <i>en masse</i> in 1956&#150;7 when the leadership defended the suppression of the Hungarian uprising, and belittled Khrushchov's &#145;revelations&#146; of the mass repression and judicial murders habitual in the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>Heinemann's hardened stance relented only in the 1960s. By then she had returned to teaching (1959) and to academic life (1965), the latter when she became a lecturer in English at Goldsmiths' College, London. Her two main areas of research now were the 1930s and Renaissance drama, both periods marked for her by their fascinating relation between literature and politics. She collaborated with Noreen Branson, a friend since her Labour Research Department days, on <span class="italic">Britain in the Nineteen Thirties</span> (1971), and co-edited <span class="italic">Culture and Crisis in Britain in the Thirties</span> (1979), a major reappraisal of the left-wing cultural endeavours of the decade. This book had developed out of lectures at the Communist University, an annual summer school run in the 1970s and 1980s in which she taught a regenerated Marxism to a rejuvenated membership and to radicals from outside the party and the university.<br>
<br>But wider academic recognition came only with Heinemann's belated appointment as fellow of New Hall, Cambridge, in 1976 and the publication of her celebrated study <span class="italic">Puritanism and Theatre</span> (1980). In this book she portrayed Thomas Middleton as a playwright close to the growing number of critics of the court, and traced a thread of continuity between early Stuart theatre and the upsurge of popular pamphleteering in the 1640s. A vigorous lecturer combining lived political experience and a passion for literature and teaching, she was in her later years much in demand as a speaker and a contributor to essay collections, even after retirement.<br>
<br>Heinemann belonged to a generation of British Marxists whose formative years were during the anti-war and anti-fascist struggles of the first half of the 1930s. Loyalty to the Soviet Union, the country which embodied the hopes of millions of downtrodden people across the world, which alone had delivered arms to the beleaguered republican government of Spain, and which had borne the brunt of the German attack in the Second World War, came naturally. Conversion to communism was a total commitment, and devotion to the cause came before considerations of a career.<br>
<br>Heinemann always held dear the memory of John Cornford, to the point of becoming embattled against what she felt to be libellous statements about his behaviour. In scholarly debates she would, with sure touch, seize upon the weaknesses in an argument and could be both a formidable opponent and an equally indomitable ally. At the same time, former students and younger colleagues described her as a generous mentor, encouraging and supportive, critical but never evasive. Heinemann was small in stature, but a powerful personality with a piercing gaze which few who encountered her, political friend or foe, were ever likely to forget.<br>
<br>Heinemann died of bronchitis on 9 June 1992 in The Pines, a nursing home in Putney, London. After cremation her ashes were scattered on a mountain in Ross, Scotland. The Festschrift-to-be, <span class="italic">Heart of the Heartless World</span>, became a memorial volume.<br>
