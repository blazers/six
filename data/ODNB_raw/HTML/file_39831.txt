<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gibbons,  Stella Dorothea</span>  (1902&#150;1989), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 5 January 1902 in Malden Crescent, London, the only daughter and eldest of three children of (Charles James Preston) Telford Gibbons, medical doctor, and his wife, Maude Phoebe Standish Williams. She grew up in the dismal environment of Kentish Town where her father had his medical practice in Malden Crescent. Her childhood was unhappy and turbulent. She withdrew into stories and solitary games in her attic room to avoid the constant family rows which revolved around her preposterous father. He was unfaithful with a succession of governesses, against a noisy background of self-dramatizing uncles and aunts. Fortunately her mother was quiet and sensible, so she had some emotional refuge from the storms.<br>
<br>Gibbons was educated at home and then sent to the North London Collegiate School for Girls. At University College, London, she did a two-year course on journalism (set up for soldiers who had returned from the First World War). Her first job, in 1923, was as a cable decoder for British United Press. For the next decade she worked as a London journalist for various publications, including the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> and <span class="italic">The Lady</span>. Her first published book was a slim volume of poems (<span class="italic">The Mountain Beast</span>, 1930). No one could have guessed that the author of this neo-Georgian verse was about to spring a comic classic upon the world. <span class="italic">Cold Comfort Farm</span> (1932) was written as a parody of the novels of D. H. Lawrence and Mary Webb, with asterisks marking all the purple passages for the reader's delectation and mirth. Her characters soon became household names and her heroine Flora Poste a synonym for common sense. Flora goes to stay with her cousins, the Starkadders, on their decrepit farm in Sussex. From dawn to dusk the Starkadders live in a ferment of unruly passion but she manages them with cunning and dispatch, including the seething matriarch in the attic, Aunt Ada Doom.<br>
<br>Even minor characters like Mr Mybug, who is unable to look at a hill without thinking of women's breasts, are a comic delight, as are the cows, Feckless, Graceless, Pointless, and Aimless, who tend to lose their legs. All over the English-speaking world her fans quoted chunks of the novel to each other, rocking with laughter, and the expression &#145;something nasty in the woodshed&#146; gained a permanent place in the language.<br>
<br>After such a towering success so young the rest of Stella Gibbons's professional life was an anticlimax, despite her excessive industry and talent. Her second novel, <span class="italic">Bassett</span> (1934), was fuelled by an unhappy affair with a German businessman. In 1933 she met and married Allan Bourne Webb, an actor and singer, the son of the Revd Charles Johnston Bourne Webb. They had one daughter and lived happily ever after (not always grist to a writer's mill). Her subsequent writing (including poetry and short stories) was published at the rate of almost one book a year, until 1970. There were almost thirty of them. Some of the novels, like <span class="italic">Miss Linsey and Pa</span> (1936), <span class="italic">My American</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">Here be Dragons</span> (1956), were reasonably well received. The novel she preferred was <span class="italic">Ticky</span> (1943), a satire on army life, which flopped. In 1940 she tried to revive the magic formula with <span class="italic">Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm</span>, but it lacked the panache of the original, as did <span class="italic">Conference at Cold Comfort Farm</span> (short stories, 1949).<br>
<br>Stella Gibbons took her poetry more seriously than her prose and some of it, about nature and the pollution of the seas, was prophetic. Her <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was published in 1950. Longman was her main publisher until 1955, when she moved to Hodder and Stoughton. She was a member of the Royal Society of Literature (fellow, 1950) and was awarded the Femina Vie Heureuse prize in 1933 for <span class="italic">Cold Comfort Farm</span>.<br>
<br>After her marriage, Stella Gibbons had moved to 19 Oakeshott Avenue, London, a mock-Tudor house in a Highgate backwater. She remained there after her husband's death in 1959. During their long marriage the only suffering he caused her was his absence in the army during the Second World War. In the last part of her life she held an &#145;at home&#146; once a month. She was known to expel guests from these tea parties if they were shrill, dramatic, or wrote tragic novels. The irony of her creative life is that the thing she hated most, overheated emotions, had given her the most inspiration. Ordinary life and personal goodness, which she enjoyed writing about, yielded a more pallid harvest. Many of her other novels have been dismissed unfairly, but some have dated. Her great joys were nature, music, and reading. She was an intensely private person, not easy to interview. Her appearance was of the blue-eyed, refined English variety and her beauty endured, as did her upright carriage, typical of Edwardian ladies who were forced as girls to walk around with a book balanced on their heads. She died on 19 December 1989 at home in Oakeshott Avenue, London.<br>
