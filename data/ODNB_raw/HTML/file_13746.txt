<span class="headword">Hopkins,  Ezekiel</span>  (1634&#150;1690), <span class="occ">bishop of Derry</span>, son of John Hopkins, curate of Sanford, and later rector of Pinhoe, Devon, was born at Crediton on 3 December 1634. He was educated first at Merchant Taylors' School from 1646 to 1648, then Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became a chorister in 1649, before matriculating on 19 November 1650 and graduating BA on 17 October 1653. Two years later he became an usher in the college school, and was appointed chaplain of the college in 1656, the year he proceeded MA.<br>
<br>At the restoration of Charles II, Hopkins travelled to London, where he became an assistant to Dr William Spurstow, one of the authors of the Smectymnuus tracts, and at that time minister of St John's, Hackney. Hopkins, who conformed after the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662, was elected preacher of St Edmund's, Lombard Street, or, according to one authority, St Mary Woolnoth. In 1663 he published a sermon on the death of Grevill. In 1666 Hopkins left charred and smoking London for his home county of Devon, where he was shortly afterwards chosen minister of St Mary Arches, Exeter. In 1668 he published a <span class="italic">Treatise on the vanity of the world</span>, dedicated to his wife, Alice (<i>bap</i>. 1645, <i>d</i>. 1681), only daughter of Samuel Moore of London, a niece of London goldsmith Sir Thomas Vyner.<br>
<br>At Exeter the eloquence and wit of Hopkins's preaching attracted the favourable attention of John, Lord Roberts, baron of Truro, who, on being appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1669, made Hopkins his domestic chaplain. On 22 November 1669 Hopkins became archdeacon and treasurer of Waterford, and on 8 December he was instituted as prebendary of Rathmichael, though he was never installed there. His entry into the established church of Ireland was sufficient to protect his career prospects from the rapid decline of Lord Roberts in the king's estimation, and his replacement as chief governor.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1670 Hopkins was appointed dean of Raphoe, and on 29 October in the following year was consecrated bishop there. The same year, 1671, he published a sermon on submission to rulers and religious conformity which he had preached the year before at Christ Church, Dublin. In it, he inveighed against a generation of men who &#145;thought the debate of a rite, or the mode of discipline, cause enough to warrant arms, and blood, and the ruin of kingdoms&#146;  (Greaves, 102). Such sentiments were rather more in keeping with those of the new lord lieutenant, Lord Berkeley, than they were with those of his predecessor. Hopkins resided constantly in his diocese. He was translated to the bishopric of Derry on 11 November 1681. He contributed largely to the adornment of the cathedral of his new diocese, furnishing an organ and handsome communion plate. He also kept a sharp eye out for the discovery of presbyterian plotting.<br>
<br>In 1685 Hopkins married his second wife, Lady Araminta (or Aramintha) Roberts (<i>bap</i>. 1655), daughter of his former patron. On the outbreak of the rebellion in support of James II in 1688 Hopkins fled to England, having offended the apprentice boys of Londonderry by suggesting, in company with many of the leading citizens there, and in accordance with his lifelong commitment to the principle of non-resistance, that they reopen the city gates to admit Tyrconnel's garrison. In May 1689 Hopkins was attainted of treason in his absence by the patriot parliament. That September he was elected preacher of the parish church of St Mary Aldermanbury in London. Hopkins died on 19 June 1690, and was buried on the 24th in the church where he then served. He was survived by two sons by his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13744/', "Charles Hopkins")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13749/', "John Hopkins")</script>. His funeral sermon was preached by Dr Richard Tenison, bishop of Clogher. Despite at least one contemporary complaint that Hopkins's preaching style was uninspiring, his works long survived him. A volume of his sermons was published by the bishop of Cork and Ross in 1692, and aside from a number of other volumes an edition of his works appeared in 1701. To these were added in 1712 his <span class="italic">Doctrine of the two covenants</span>, <span class="italic">Doctrine of the two sacraments</span>, and <span class="italic">Death disarmed of sting</span>. An edition of his works was published in four volumes by Josiah Pratt in 1809.<br>
