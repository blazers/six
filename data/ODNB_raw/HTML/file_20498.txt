<span class="headword">&Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh,  M&iacute;ch&eacute;l</span> <span class="st"> [Michael O'Clery]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1590?, <em>d.</em> 1643?), <span class="occ">scribe and chronicler</span>, was born at Kilbarron, near Ballyshannon in south co. Donegal, the youngest of four sons of Donnchadh, a grandson of Tuathal &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh (<i>d</i>. 1512), and a member of a hereditary learned family; his mother was On&oacute;ra Ultach. Given Tadhg as his baptismal name, he was known as Tadhg an tSl&eacute;ibhe (&#145;Tadhg of the mountain&#146;) until, on entering religious life, he adopted the name M&iacute;ch&eacute;l (Michael). Of two elder brothers, Uilliam and Conaire, very little is known, except that the latter was a scribe who collaborated for a time in M&iacute;ch&eacute;l's greatest scholarly project. A third, Maolmhuire, born in 1588 or 1589, entered the Irish College at Salamanca in 1610 and became a Franciscan in 1616 in the Irish College of St Anthony at Louvain in the Spanish Netherlands; ordained a priest in 1619, he took the name Bernaird&iacute;n, and by the 1630s was guardian of the Franciscan convent of Donegal, with which M&iacute;ch&eacute;l was also associated. Tadhg himself seems to have received a thorough grounding in traditional Irish learning, probably in one of the few remaining Gaelic schools&#151;he indicates, for example, that he was taught by one Baothghalach Ruadh Mac Aodhag&aacute;in, whose precise identity is uncertain but who may have conducted a school at Ballymacegan in north co. Tipperary. Tadhg followed his older brother to the continent, and it has been suggested that he served for a time as a soldier. He may be identical to the Don Tadeo Cleri to whom the Spanish authorities in July 1621 granted 2 crowns monthly on account of &#145;the persecution and loss of estate he had suffered for the Catholic cause in Ireland&#146;  (Breatnach, 13). He joined the Franciscan order as a lay brother some time before March 1623. Never ordained priest, he was known as An Br&aacute;thair Bocht M&iacute;ch&eacute;l (&#145;the poor Brother Michael&#146;).<br>
<br>&Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh was based at Louvain, where plans were already well advanced to gather for publication all available material on the lives of the early Irish saints. Directing this project was another Donegal man, Father Hugh Ward, who was supported and advised by his friend and colleague Father Patrick Fleming. It was they who in 1624 conceived the idea of &#145;sending Brother Clery to Ireland&#146;  (Breatnach, 11) to collect relevant source material in Irish or Latin and transmit it back to Louvain. In the summer of 1626, on Ward's election as guardian of St Anthony's, Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l returned to his homeland. During his period of just over a decade at home, his principal base of operations was the so-called &#145;Franciscan convent of Donegal&#146;&#151;which had been forced by intermittent persecution to relocate to a &#145;place of refuge&#146; on the banks of the small River Drowes that marks the border between counties Donegal and Leitrim (and, therefore, between the provinces of Ulster and Connaught). Details of Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l's activities and travels on his return to Ireland emerge from the numerous colophons, giving dates and places of writing, which he inserted into many of his works.<br>
<br>It would appear that &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh spent much of his first year in Ireland in the convent &#145;at Drowes&#146; (otherwise known as the convent of Donegal). The earliest datable piece transcribed by him was penned on 28 March 1627. By the late summer of 1627 (and possibly earlier) he had set out&#151;probably on horseback&#151;on the first of several journeys throughout Ireland. This took him to Dublin and its vicinity in August. In Drogheda he copied material&#151;including, it would seem, the early ninth-century martyrology of Tallaght&#151;from ten detached leaves of the twelfth-century <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>. These leaves, probably found in the library of the Church of Ireland primate, Archbishop James Ussher, soon afterwards passed, via the convent of Donegal, to Louvain, but there is no information on &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's presumed role in the transfer.<br>
<br>Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l moved on to the friary of Kildare, where in October he transcribed material from the main body of the <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>. Some time later he returned to his base at Drowes. There, between January and late June 1628, he copied several texts, presumably from manuscripts he had collected, borrowed, or hastily transcribed during his journey through Leinster. His citation in May 1628 of one of the sources he used, <span class="italic">Lebor na hUidre</span>&#151;the earliest surviving collection of early Irish prose texts&#151;is the first extant reference to that celebrated manuscript (dating from about 1100) since the year 1470. An important text whose transcription &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh completed in this year was the so-called short recension of the martyrology of Donegal, on which work had begun as early as 1624, two years before he returned to Ireland.<br>
<br>Back in Dublin by mid-July 1628 Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l transcribed several saints' lives. In co. Wicklow he copied a metrical account of St Coemgen (Kevin) of Glendalough and in mid-September, in co. Carlow, he copied a prose life of the same saint. He reached Cashel by early October and apparently remained in the south for more than a year: a letter to Hugh Ward in Louvain in January 1629 tells of &#145;your Brother Clery&#146; having been sent to Ormond &#145;to write there for a time&#146; and reports that he had &#145;made a collection of more than three or four hundred lives&#146;  (Breatnach, 19). During his Munster sojourn he visited the school of history and law conducted by Flann Mac Aodhag&aacute;in at Ballymacegan, co. Tipperary. In February he was doing transcription work in the convent of the friars of Athlone, at Killinure, co. Westmeath, and in March, in the Franciscan house at Multyfarnham, co. Westmeath, he copied the twelfth-century propaganda tract <span class="italic">Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh</span>. In late spring he appears to have moved south again, to Clonmel and Wexford, where he copied further saints' lives, and on to Timoleague in west Cork, where, in mid-June, he copied from the great codex, the <span class="roman">Book of Mac Carrthaig Riabach</span>, now known as the <span class="roman">Book of Lismore</span>. Later in June and early July he copied numerous texts in Cork city and then moved north, via counties Limerick and Clare (where he picked up some further items), reaching co. Galway by early October. There he consulted at least part of the great <span class="roman">Book of Duniry</span>, now known as the <span class="italic">Leabhar Breac</span>.<br>
<br>By mid-November 1629 Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l was finally back at Drowes and there, during the winter, he penned some two dozen lives of saints and other texts&#151;many of them, no doubt, fair copies of works previously borrowed or hastily transcribed. In April he completed the final revised version of the great compilation <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire na naomh n&Eacute;rennach</span> (the longer recension of the martyrology of Donegal).<br>
<br>Nothing is known of &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's activity from mid-April to early October 1630. Then, for a month, he and three assistants&#151;Fearfeasa &Oacute; Maolchonaire from co. Roscommon, C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh from co. Donegal, and C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Duibhgeann&aacute;in from co. Leitrim&#151;worked at Killinure, near Athlone, compiling, under the patronage of a local gentleman, Toirdhealbhach Mac Cochl&aacute;in, the genealogical work <span class="italic">Seanchas R&iacute;ogh &Eacute;reann accus Genealuighi na naomh n&Eacute;reannach</span> (also known as <span class="italic">R&eacute;im R&iacute;oghraidhe na h&Eacute;ireann agus Seanchas a naomh</span> and by the Latin title <span class="italic">Genealogiae regum et sanctorum Hiberniae</span>). On completion it received the approbation of a local scholar, Conall Mag Eochag&aacute;in. By late December Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l was back at Drowes and early in 1631 he penned extracts from the ninth-century martyrology of &Oacute;engus.<br>
<br>From late October to late December 1631 Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l, along with four assistants&#151;the three mentioned above and a Fermanagh scholar, Giolla P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Luin&iacute;n&#151;were working at Lisgoole, co. Fermanagh. Under the patronage of Briain Ruadh Mag Uidhir (Maguire), Baron of Enniskillen, they compiled a new recension of the medieval work of Irish pseudo-prehistory <span class="italic">Leabhar gabh&aacute;la &Eacute;ireann</span> (&#145;The book of conquest of Ireland&#146;). This marked a new departure, with &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh beginning also to collect and transcribe secular material.<br>
<br>Some time in 1632 work on assembling the largest of all sets of Irish annals commenced at Drowes, under the patronage of Fearghal &Oacute; Gadhra, MP for co. Sligo. It resulted, over the next four years, in the compilation for which &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh is principally remembered, the enormous collection known as <span class="italic">Ann&aacute;la R&iacute;oghachta &Eacute;ireann</span> (&#145;Annals of the kingdom of Ireland&#146;) but more popularly known, in reference to Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l and his assistants, as the annals of the four masters. (The four in question were himself and the three principal assistants already named as working on the <span class="italic">R&eacute;im R&iacute;oghraidhe</span> and <span class="italic">Leabhar gabh&aacute;la</span>, but two others also helped: Muiris mac Torna U&iacute; Mhaolchonaire, for a month, and Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l's elder brother Conaire, for a slightly longer period.) The first portion of the work (to the year 1208) was completed before the close of 1632. Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l appears not to have left Drowes throughout this year&#151;except for a possible brief visit to Ballymacegan, where, on 31 August, Flann Mac Aodhag&aacute;in signed a short approbation for the <span class="italic">R&eacute;im R&iacute;oghraidhe</span>.<br>
<br>In August 1633 &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh copied the twelfth-century martyrology <span class="italic">F&eacute;ilire U&iacute; Ghorm&aacute;in</span> at Drowes, but he probably spent most of this and the following year, 1634, assembling further materials for the annals. In summer 1634, however, he returned to co. Clare to collect more hagiographical material. While much of the next year, 1635, was devoted to compiling most of the second part of the annals (from 1208 down to the early seventeenth century), Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l took time in May to copy a saint's life at Drowes and in November to copy (for a second time) the bulky volume <span class="italic">Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh</span>. In April 1636, also at Drowes, he penned a copy of the lengthy hagiographical poem <span class="italic">Naoimhshenchus naomh Innsi F&aacute;il</span>. By the middle of August 1636 his and his team's epic labours on the annals were completed.<br>
<br>In autumn 1636, having obtained the signatures of his Franciscan confr&egrave;res in the convent of Donegal for the annals (of which two manuscript copies had been penned), &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh set off to seek approbations for his various works from scholars and ecclesiastical authorities. On his way south, in late October, he visited the Poor Clare sisters at Bethlehem, co. Westmeath, where he copied an Irish translation of part of the &#145;Rule of St Clare&#146;. In November Flann Mac Aodhag&aacute;in in Tipperary, Conchubhar Mac Bruaideadha in co. Clare, Archbishop Malachy O'Queely in Galway city, and Bishop Boethius MacEgan of Elphin, elsewhere in co. Galway, all provided glowing testimonials for <span class="italic">Genealogiae regum et sanctorum Hiberniae</span>, <span class="italic">F&eacute;lire na naomh n&Eacute;rennach</span>, and the &#145;Annals&#146;. Early 1637 saw &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh in Leinster, where Bishop Ross Mac Geoghegan of Kildare in January and Archbishop Thomas Fleming of Dublin in February also approved his writings.<br>
<br>Early in 1637 Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l may have returned briefly to co. Clare, where Conchubhar Mac Bruaideadha had just died, and he may also have returned to Drowes one last time before, in July, making his way to Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, where&#151;it is presumed&#151;he took ship for the continent.<br>
<br>Just prior to his departure, &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's great annalistic compilation was fiercely criticized by a fellow Franciscan, Tuileagna &Oacute; Maolchonaire, who sought&#151;on rather petty grounds&#151;to prevent its publication and have the approbations withdrawn. Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l made a reply, now lost, and the matter may have been discussed at a Franciscan chapter in Munster in 1638. In August 1641 Tuileagna and two of the compilers, C&uacute; Choigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh and Fearfeasa &Oacute; Maolchonaire, appeared at a provincial chapter at Multyfarnham. A committee that considered the charges decided against the accuser, but as late as 1646 Tuileagna was still persisting in his arguments with Fearfeasa. The fact that most of &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's voluminous collections did not appear in print until the nineteenth, or even the twentieth, century&#151;and a good deal still remains unpublished&#151;was not, however, due to Tuileagna's objections but rather to the poverty and other difficulties, including illness and death, that dogged the Louvain project. And his confr&egrave;re's criticisms may not have been the greatest risk run by Brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l: a contemporary remarked that it was &#145;no small miracle that Tadhg &Oacute; Cl&eacute;ire was not hanged in Ireland, since everyone knew of his journeyings, and that he failed in nothing that he set out to do&#151;gathering everything into his granary&#146;  (&Oacute; Maonaigh, 203).<br>
<br>M&iacute;ch&eacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh returned to Louvain some two years after Hugh Ward's untimely death, and work on the saints' lives was now being directed by the Inishowen man Father John Colgan, later responsible for the &#145;four masters&#146; appellation. The only other thing known of &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh is that in autumn 1643 was published the only work of his to appear in print during his lifetime, a glossary entitled <span class="italic">Focl&oacute;ir n&oacute; sanas&aacute;n nua</span>. After that, all is silence. It is thought that the humble, hard-working lay brother M&iacute;ch&eacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh died in Louvain, at St Anthony's College, before the close of 1643, but even this is uncertain, as is the location of his grave. There is surely a great irony in the fact that this greatest recorder of the lives of holy men and others in the whole history of Ireland should himself have left such sparse biographical detail. His lasting monument, that for which he deserves to be remembered, is his voluminous manuscript writings, scattered between Ireland and Belgium, notably in the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale in Brussels. In the words of one leading authority, &#145;This humble Brother, who hid himself so completely while accomplishing so much &hellip; has written his name large across the history of his country, and has left it engraved indelibly on the hearts of his countrymen&#146;  (Jennings, 174).<br>
