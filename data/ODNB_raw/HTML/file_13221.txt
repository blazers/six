<span class="headword">Hieron,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1572, <em>d.</em> 1617), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and devotional writer</span>, was born in London and baptized at St Peter-le-Poer on 10 August 1572, the son of Roger Hieron, Heron, or Herryn, schoolmaster and later vicar of Epping, Essex, who was a friend of John Foxe the martyrologist. Initially taught by his father, in July 1584 he was admitted to Eton College, where he became a king's scholar in 1586. On 24 August 1590 he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected a fellow in 1593 and graduated BA in 1595. Encouraged and financially assisted in his studies by Sir Francis Barrington of Barrington Hall, Essex, Hieron also benefited much, according to his biographer John Quick, from the godly atmosphere then prevailing at Cambridge. As a result, according to his other biographer, Robert Hill, when he first preached in the college chapel &#145;he seemed rather a Bachelor of Divinity than a Bachelor of Arts, rather a Divine of forty, than one of four and twenty&#146;  (Quick, 56).<br>
<br>Ordained deacon in London on 21 December 1595, Hieron became a notable preacher in the city: exactly where is unknown, but he later acknowledged in <span class="italic">The Christians Journall</span> (1609) Barrington's &#145;kind watering&#146; of his &#145;first endeavours in the Ministerie&#146;  (A2). He once delivered a sermon in the Chapel Royal at Whitehall which Queen Elizabeth, punning on their respective names as &#145;heron&#146; and &#145;mountain&#146;, reputedly considered to have soared higher than that of the previous preacher, George Montaigne. However, he declined offers of preferment in the city churches and at the inns of court and returned to Cambridge to proceed MA in 1598. The following year he resigned his fellowship and on the presentation of Henry Savile, as provost of Eton, was on 4 July instituted to the vicarage of Modbury, Devon. About this time he married Mildred, whose other name is unknown: their first child, Roger, was baptized at Modbury probably in March 1600; five further sons and three daughters were baptized there between 1601 and 1616.<br>
<br>Hieron rapidly established a pioneering preaching ministry which drew a large cross-section of south Devon society, and which was respectfully remembered in the later seventeenth century as having laid the foundation of a vigorous tradition of puritan nonconformity in the area. Its hallmarks are evident in his earliest printed works, <span class="italic">The Preachers Plea</span> and <span class="italic">An Answere to a Popish Ryme, Lately Scattered Abroad in the West</span>, which appeared in 1604. The former proclaims the saving and sanctifying work of sermons through a &#145;homely and coarse discourse&#146; between a minister and a pious man; the latter seeks to make the protestant response to Catholics' criticisms accessible through simple verse. Both carry learned marginal notes, but in the conviction that &#145;plain-ness&#146; was &#145;the best eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Truths Purchase</span>, 1606, dedication) Hieron deliberately reined himself in: &#145;I have bound myselfe to studye so to speake, as that I may not exceede the conceit of common hearers&#146; he explained in the dedication to <span class="italic">The Spirituall Sonneshipe</span> (1611).<br>
<br>Implacable against wicked popes, &#145;carnall Cardinals&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Answere</span>, C2<i>v</i>), the mass&#151;&#145;a grosse device, defaming Christ&#146;  (ibid., C1<i>v</i>)&#151;and Roman idolatry, Hieron rejected the charge of sectarianism, and clung to the Church of England:<blockquote>
<div>We doe not hang on Calvins sleeve<br>
</div>
<div>Nor yet on Zwinglius we beleeve<br>
</div>
<div>And Puritanes we doe defye<br>
</div>
<div>If right the name you do apply<br>
</div>
<div>All giddy Sects among us crept<br>
</div>
<div>We wish out of our Church were swept;<br>
</div> (ibid., B3)</blockquote>Yet, although his works confirm that &#145;he was not absolutely against the use of a Forme of prayer&#146;  (Quick, 59), in his Sunday morning and afternoon services &#145;he never confined himself to the use of the publick liturgy, nor did he at all conforme unto the Ceremonys&#146;  (ibid., 60). On one occasion when he wore a surplice the adverse reaction of his congregation was reported to have induced him to abandon it altogether. Such practices, together with his conviction, as expressed in <span class="italic">The Dignitie of Scripture</span> (1607), that nothing must be added to scripture, and his promotion in the west country of the millenary petition, five times led to his suspension by the normally moderate bishop of Exeter, William Cotton. Each time Sir William Strode went to London to plead on his behalf; each time, according to Quick, he returned with a discharge and a new preaching licence. Similarly, friends in Plymouth arranged for the printing and distribution of his clandestine <span class="italic">A defence of the ministers reasons for refusall of subscription to the Book of Common Prayer and of conformitie</span> [1607].<br>
<br>That Hieron not only remained at Modbury but also very publicly prospered seems to have been due both to an inherent loyalty to the national church, whatever its shortcomings in his eyes, and to the formidable array of local and non-local notables who promoted his ministry. A 1615 sermon proclaimed that he rejoiced to be a son of &#145;our English church &hellip; wherein, it shall be my glorie and my crown in the day of Christ, to have been employed as a minister&#146;  (Wolffe, 96). The very many patrons, friends, and fellow workers for the gospel revealed in dedications to his publications included: William Herbert, earl of Pembroke and lord warden of the stannaries of Devon, to whom he sometimes acted as chaplain; Robert Rich, Lord Rich; the Champernownes of Modbury; local magistrates like Sir Ferdinando Gorges; Lady Strode and Lady Hele, both his spiritual daughters, the latter being a convert from Catholicism; Sir John Poyntz, &#145;one of his majesty's pensioners&#146;; and Laurence Chaderton and Roger Goad, respectively masters of Emmanuel College and King's College, Cambridge. As Hieron explained in a funeral sermon for Henry Sommaster of Pensford, reproduced in <span class="italic">Three Sermons</span> (1607), magistrates and ministers were joint leaders of the people in the fight for the maintenance of religion. On the other hand, as he asserted in a Gunpowder Plot commemoration address issued in <span class="italic">Three Sermons</span> (1609), those who professed true religion yet were adversaries to its life and power were as much enemies as were the papists.<br>
<br>Hieron published extensively, with the first of several major collections of his works appearing, apparently on his own initiative, in 1614. However, it was his <span class="italic">A Helpe unto Devotion</span> (1608), which became a cornerstone of contemporary piety and made him a household name. Here the pastor who acknowledged &#145;that set formes of Prayer are very distastfull to many&#146; who considered them &#145;a kind of confining and limiting of Gods Spirit&#146;, dismissed not just the &#145;fondnesse&#146; of those &#145;who scarce count it praying, unlesse it bee by a booke&#146;, but also &#145;their carelesness, who labor not to attaine to an ability of commending their personall occasions &hellip; unto God&#146;. Not prescriptively, but as a manual in orderly and effective intercession, to assist &#145;stammering and lisping tongues&#146; to develop into &#145;tongues as fined silver &hellip; plainly and distinctly to speake the language of Canaan&#146;, he offered template prayers for everyday occasions and moods  (foreword). His final prayer &#145;For the Whole State&#146;  gave thanks for prolonged peace, for the light of the Gospel and for freedom from the &#145;miserable bondage of Romish and Antichristian tyrannie&#146;  (p. 239), although continued watchfulness was necessary to counter the &#145;many Locusts&#146; and &#145;continual spawn of new conspirators&#146;, that &#145;come dayly out of that Pit of Rome&#146;  (p. 258). It called on God not only to furnish &#145;everie place &hellip; with a Pastor after thine own heart&#146; but, more provocatively, to &#145;restraine and reforme the greedinesse of those which muzzle their mouthes that should tread out the corne, and bring forth food of life to thy people&#146;  (p. 256).<br>
<br>In 1615 Sir William Strode established a lecture at Modbury itself, the one place stubbornly resistant to Hieron's energetic and persuasive oratory, but by this time his health was being progressively undermined by the stone and by gout. In the aftermath of a crowded lecture at Plympton on a hot day in May 1617 he succumbed to a chill, but according to Quick it was heart disease which, after four weeks' illness, killed him at Modbury on 17 June; he was buried in the church there the same day. The funeral sermon, preached by Hieron's closest ministerial friend, John Barlow, lecturer at Plymouth, was published as <span class="italic">Mr Hierons Last Farewell</span> (1618); the funeral charges were paid by Lady Hele, who also gave his widow an annuity and provided for some of his children. Several of his sons became clergymen, but it was his grandson and namesake Samuel Hieron (<i>d</i>. 1686), ejected rector of Feniton, Devon, and licensed presbyterian preacher, who followed most closely in his footsteps and who helped ensure, through his friendship with Quick, that the reputation of the &#145;Star of the West&#146;, the proto-nonconformist of the Jacobean church, was kept alive not just locally but among the godly at large.<br>
