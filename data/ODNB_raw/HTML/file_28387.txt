<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wadham,  Nicholas</span>  (1531/2&#150;1609), <span class="occ">benefactor of Wadham College, Oxford</span>, was probably born at the family seat, Merrifield, near Ilton, Somerset, the only son of John Wadham (<i>d</i>. 1578) and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. 1583), daughter of John Tregarthin and widow of John Kellaway. The Wadhams had been at Edge Manor, Branscombe, in south Devon since the late fourteenth century. Sir John Wadham (<i>d</i>. 1412), justice of the common pleas, acquired extensive properties in Devon and Somerset, augmented through the fifteenth century by a series of marriages to heiresses. Nicholas Wadham's grandfather Sir Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1542) was at various times sheriff of Somerset and Dorset, of Devon, and of Wiltshire. Sir Nicholas's youngest son, also Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1551), was a member of Thomas Cromwell's household, subsequently holding court office as a gentleman pensioner, and commanding troops in Boulogne from 1544. John Wadham was less prominent than his father, but was sheriff of Somerset and Dorset in 1556&#150;7 and retained a place on the Somerset commission of the peace until his death in 1578.<br>
<br>A brief biography, written before 1637, has Wadham attending Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as a commoner (&#145;commensalis&#146;), evidently not taking a degree. He may also have lodged with the civil lawyer John Kennall, subsequently canon of Christ Church; Kennall was presented to the Wadham benefice of Silverton, Devon, in 1583, and eventually died a Catholic. The same biography has Wadham briefly at court (&#145;vitam Aulicam aliquantisper ingressus est&#146;). He is almost certainly the Nicholas Wadham of Brimpton, Somerset, admitted to the Inner Temple on 9 March 1553 &#145;on the pledge of Richard Baker&#146;, shortly to be his brother-in-law. Baker was married to Catherine Tyrell, a stepdaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22047/', "Sir William Petre")</script>, principal secretary to the king. Petre, of Devon origins, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and colleague of Thomas Cromwell, must have known the Wadhams. On 3 September 1555 Nicholas Wadham married Petre's eldest daughter, Dorothy (1534/5&#150;1618), at St Botolph, Aldersgate [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46470/', "Wadham, Dorothy")</script>].<br>
<br>In spite of these court connections Wadham opted for a country life. Almost immediately after the marriage Sir Giles Strangways, married to Nicholas's sister Joan, made over his wardenship of Roche forest in Somerset to be held jointly with him. Wadham and his wife lived with his parents, and under their shadow, until his father died in 1578, at which point his mother moved to the dower house at Edge. Wadham was then appointed to the commission of the peace and to other minor commissions in Somerset. He appears as executor and overseer in the wills of other Somerset gentlemen. Only two personal letters have come to light: one is from Sir Amias Paulet, ambassador in France in 1577, remarking that Wadham was unlikely &#145;to be envious of our French news&#146; and thanking him for his efforts about the leasing of Paulet's park  (Ogle, 48&#150;9); the other is to John Talbot of Grafton, married to Dorothy's sister Katherine&#151;again Wadham had used his good offices in negotiating a lease.<br>
<br>Wadham was a shrewd property manager. By his death he had added lands worth at least &pound;800 per annum to his inherited estate, worth some &pound;3000 per annum, making him &#145;among the fifty or so richest men in England, and well up in the peerage class&#146;  (Stone, 118&#150;19). He was renowned for his hospitality and maintained a magnificent household at Merrifield. Following his father's example, he arranged in his will for a full heraldic funeral, costing &pound;500, and for alms to be distributed widely over the county. His old-fashioned views may help explain his Catholic inclinations, as do his wife's connections. After his death Thomas Moore, a Roman Catholic priest, described him as &#145;an ancient schismatic&#146;, implying that he attended Church of England worship. However, Wadham evidently generated suspicion. Some time between 1593 and 1596 he was removed from the commission of the peace; at about the same time he began to cede his rights of ecclesiastical presentation to others. (The &#145;Master Wadham&#146; involved in 1597 in tracking an escaped priest may be his cousin Edward.) He seems never to have been convicted of recusancy, but came close in 1608 when the privy council ordered a &#145;stay of proceedings&#146; against both Wadhams on that charge. Thomas Moore claimed him as &#145;dying a Catholic&#146;  (Questier, 63).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Wadham maintained good relations with his protestant neighbours. John Carpenter, the incumbent of Branscombe, dedicated his <span class="italic">Contemplations; for the Institution of Children in the Christian Religion</span> (1601) to him, remarking on his &#145;gentle affability with all persons&#146; and his material generosity rather than on any spiritual qualities. Wadham was probably responsible for the fine oak gallery at Branscombe church. The later story that he intended to found a college for English Catholics at Venice seems improbable, if only because the illegality and impracticality of such an action is at odds with Wadham's character. Childless, and with his inheritance due to pass to the children of his three sisters, Wadham was determined to use the additional wealth he had accumulated to perpetuate his name. In 1606 he founded an almshouse at Ilton for eight poor people. He had been setting money aside for the foundation of a college at Oxford for some time, but nothing was put on paper and Wadham's contradictory instructions on his deathbed were to sow confusion, ably resolved by his widow. His contribution was restricted to the financial, amounting to a munificent &pound;19,000. Wadham died at Merrifield on 20 October 1609, aged seventy-seven, and was buried in the Wadham family chapel at St Mary's Church, Ilminster on 21 November.<br>
