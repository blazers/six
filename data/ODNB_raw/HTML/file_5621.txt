<span class="headword">Clerk,  Matthew</span>  (1659&#150;1735), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born near Kilrea, co. Derry, of parents who are unknown. His early years are obscure but he was an officer in Derry during the siege (1688&#150;9), and received a bullet wound on the temple, leaving a sore, over which he wore a black patch to the end of his days. It was not until after the siege that he began his studies for the ministry. He was ordained in 1697 by the Route presbytery as minister of Kilrea and Boveedy, co. Derry. In 1721 he was the sole dissentient from the synod's &#145;charitable declaration&#146;, an attempt to reach a compromise with the minority of clergymen who opposed subscription to the Westminster confession of faith. Next year he, with two others, entered a strong protest against making any concessions to the non-subscribing party. This party attacked him in his own presbytery, but though the matter was referred to the synod the non-subscribers were too much occupied in defending themselves to proceed with it. Clerk's literary contribution to the controversy, <span class="italic">A Letter from the Countrey, to a Friend in Belfast, with Respect to the Belfast Society</span> (1722), was the first on either side which appeared with the author's name. His friends considered his manner of writing not sufficiently grave in tone. &#145;I don't think&#146;, wrote Livingstone of Templepatrick to Wodrow on 23 June 1723, &#145;his reasoning faculty is despisable, but I wish it were equal to his diverting one, for I think he is one of the most comical old fellows that ever was&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>On 29 April 1729 Clerk resigned his charge and emigrated to New Hampshire. On landing he found that James Macgregor, formerly minister of Aghadowey, and founder of the township of Londonderry on the Merrimac, had died on 5 March. He succeeded him as minister, and also engaged in educational work. Clerk had already been twice married, of which no details are known, and eventually married Macgregor's widow as his third wife. He was a strict vegetarian, but his abstemious diet did not subdue his violent tendencies. Among the anecdotes told of him is one of his criticizing St Peter: &#145;He only cut off a chiel's lug, and he ought to ha' split doun his heid&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Clerk died on 25 January 1735. He was carried to his grave by old comrades at the Derry siege.<br>
