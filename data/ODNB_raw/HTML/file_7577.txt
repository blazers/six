<span class="headword">D'Ewes, Sir  Simonds</span>, first baronet  (1602&#150;1650), <span class="occ">diarist and antiquary</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7576/', "Paul Dewes (1567&#150;1631)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7574/', "Dewes, Garrat")</script>], barrister and government official, of Wells Hall, Milden, Suffolk, and his first wife, Sissilia (<i>c</i>.1581&#150;1618), daughter and heir of another Middle Temple lawyer, Richard Simonds of Coxden, Chardstock, Dorset. Simonds was born at Coxden on 18 December 1602 and baptized in the open gallery there eleven days later. The London printer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7574/', "Garrat Dewes")</script> was his grandfather. From Richard White, vicar of Chardstock, &#145;the chief thing [he] learnt was the exact spelling and reading of English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.29&#150;30). He remained with his grandfather at Coxden until early in 1610, when, having fallen dangerously ill, he was brought to Milden, where the air was considered to be better. In 1607 Paul Dewes spent most of his capital to obtain one of the six clerkships in chancery which tied him to London, so that Simonds saw little of his father. He was at Lavenham School in 1611 when both Simonds grandparents died, leaving him Coxden and a large fortune, to be administered by his father during his minority. The D'Ewes title to Wells Hall was incomplete, and a widow with a life interest had them ejected. They returned to Dorset, where Simonds enjoyed three years under a new tutor, a neighbouring clergyman Christopher Malaker of Wambrook. Malaker was an excellent teacher of Latin, but neglected his pupils' spiritual development. Henry Reynolds of St Mary Axe in London next took him on, but Simonds owed his progress in French and Greek to the remarkable ability of Bathshua, his tutor's eldest daughter. Here he also learned &#145;to write a moderate good English phrase&#146;  (ibid., 1.95). Reynolds taught D'Ewes, still only fourteen, to engage in extemporary prayer in the puritan style, but they fell out in 1616, and as his parents had now acquired Stow Hall at Stowlangtoft in Suffolk, he was sent to Bury grammar school. Here in two years under John Dickinson he learned more than from his other teachers in eight, giving him his twin lifelong enthusiasms: learning and research.<h2>
<a name="Highereducation"></a>Higher education</h2>On 21 May 1618 D'Ewes entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner under Richard Holdsworth, later professor of theology at Gresham College. The death of his pious and loving mother five weeks later cast a long shadow over his time at Cambridge, making him even more serious than before. Most of his fellows, he alleged, indulged in &#145;swearing, drinking, rioting &amp; hatred of all vertue and pietie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.141). He probably exaggerated, for he certainly found soberly congenial friends, and he worked hard, regularly attending lectures and university exercises. In September 1620 his father, always passionate, obstinate, and avaricious, peremptorily ordered him to leave Cambridge and enter the Middle Temple. As by some means his admission there had been arranged at the age of nine, he now found himself &#145;ancient&#146; to over two hundred others. His father allowed Simonds only &pound;60 from his own &pound;3000 per annum and made him share his chambers in Chancery Lane; when they burnt down the next year the loss was nearly &pound;6000. When Simonds complained of poverty, his father threatened to marry a young heiress and disinherit him, so he sensibly found his father a &#145;good and ancient widow&#146;  (ibid., 1.227) and saw them safely married at St Faith's Church in March 1623. The following June, Simonds was called to the bar and his father raised his allowance to &pound;100 a year, which he regarded as a &#145;plentiful annuity&#146;  (ibid., 1.232).<br>
<br>Although he had been a conscientious student, D'Ewes had no wish to practise, for he had discovered that &#145;records, and other exotic monuments of antiquity, were the most ravishing and satisfying part of human knowledge&#146;  (Bruce, &#145;Long Parliament&#146;, 81). He therefore devoted himself to the study of historical and legal antiquities. That autumn he began his study of the national archives at the Tower of London, and spent the rest of his days copying and analysing original sources for English history. His stated ambition was to write and publish a definitive history of Britain, but he only appreciated the magnitude of the task as the extent of the evidence available became clear. Sir Robert Cotton befriended and encouraged him, introducing him to Selden, whom D'Ewes (of all people) thought &#145;a man exceedingly puffed up with the apprehension of his own abilities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.256). Cotton's example, a great stimulus, led him to concentrate on the history of English legal and political institutions. In 1625 he came upon &#145;an elaborate journal of the parliament held in the thirty-fifth year of Queen Elizabeth&#146;  (ibid., 1.280). His analysis laid the foundation of his great work on the parliamentary history of that reign. At that time he recognized that he must also study numismatics. In 1626 he joined Sir Robert Cotton in establishing the claim of Robert Vere to the earldom of Oxford, against Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby d'Eresby, who had assumed the title; it was granted to Vere by the House of Lords in the next parliament.<h2>
<a name="Thelureofrecords"></a>The lure of records</h2>That August D'Ewes gave up his practice at the bar just as a brilliant career seemed to be opening for him. &#145;But&#146;, he explained high-mindedly:<blockquote>when I saw the church of God and the gospel to be almost everywhere ruined abroad, or to be in great peril and danger, and daily feared that things would grow worse at home, I laid by all these aspiring hopes, and I resolved to moderate my desires, and to prepare my way to a better life with the greater serenity of mind and reposedness of spirit, by avoiding these two dangerous rocks of avarice and ambition. (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.307)</blockquote>The real cause was probably the arranged marriage with Anne (1613&#150;1641), daughter and heir of Sir William Clopton, late of Lutons Hall at Melford in Suffolk, who, scarcely fourteen, brought him considerable estates bordering his father's property. She was also a cousin of D'Ewes's religious friend and mentor, Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston of Kedington. They were married at St Anne Blackfriars in London on 24 October 1626, and on 6 December D'Ewes was knighted (as an obligation of landholding) at Whitehall. Shortly afterwards he took a house in Islington where he could house his expanding library in the chamber over the hall, add to his collections, and devote himself to his historical and genealogical studies, planning a work called &#145;Great Britain's strength and weakeness&#146;  (Watson, 5). Among his close friends at this period was Sir Albertus Joachimi, the ambassador for the Low Countries, for they shared religious and political interests. Alarmed by threats of large fines passed on those who stayed in London during the vacation against the king's proclamation, D'Ewes moved in 1632 to Bury St Edmunds. There he worked on the muniments of the great abbey, then in the possession of Sir Edmund Bacon of Redgrave. His father died on 14 March 1631, but D'Ewes did not move into Stow Hall until June 1633; now at last he enjoyed at least &pound;1300 a year. Here he fell out with the conformist rector, Richard Damport, who disliked D'Ewes's Presbyterian and anti-Episcopalian views, and his studious habits. Small wonder that D'Ewes toyed with the idea of emigrating to New England, encouraged by letters from his friend John Winthrop. Instead he supported a company of thirty-eight while they settled, mostly in Watertown; he also had an interest in the Providence Island Company.<br>
<br>From the elaborate record he had kept from his youth of all he read, wrote, and saw, D'Ewes began in 1637 to prepare an autobiographical summary. He had by then completed his compilation of <span class="italic">The Journals of All the Parliaments during the Reign of Queen Elizabeth</span>, which was published in 1682, edited by his nephew Paul Bowes of the Inner Temple, and dedicated to his son Willoughby.<h2>
<a name="MemberoftheLongParliament"></a>Member of the Long Parliament</h2>Having been pricked as high sheriff of Suffolk in 1639, D'Ewes submitted to the &#145;unwelcome preferment&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 379, fol. 60), which carried the heavy responsibility to levy &pound;8000 upon the county for ship money. He reluctantly paid a penny more than rector Damport's 10<i>s</i>., and, having quickly become aware of the widespread public resistance, he petitioned the council with evidence from records to prove the illegality of such taxes. Laud, &#145;that busy little wheel&#146;, urged letters to D'Ewes which were &#145;terrible, and threatening like thunder and lightning&#146;  (Bruce, &#145;Long Parliament&#146;, 83), and the council turned him over to the Star Chamber. Hoping that he could better use his knowledge of records to oppose Arminian innovations and illegal taxation under cover of parliamentary privilege, he looked for an opening there. His attitude to ship money and the support of the Barnardistons brought him the Sudbury seat in November 1640, and he took lodgings in Goats Alley, near Palace Yard, London. He entered the Long Parliament as a reformer both in church and state, and from his first appearance sat near the speaker and took the notes which now fill Harley MSS 162&#150;166. Still largely unpublished, they give an invaluably detailed account of those proceedings and the characters and motives of the men who overturned the monarchy. At first members were fascinated by his grasp of sources and precedents, and the commitment he showed by offering a bond for &pound;1000, doubled if necessary, towards paying the army in the north. He was voted onto appropriate committees, including the one to which William Prynne's and Burton's petitions were referred. He often spoke with the puritan faction in the house, but &#145;his demands upon the homage and patience of the House were excessive &hellip; He became a glutton, a very horse-leech in his importunity for highly-seasoned compliments to his erudition, and humble submission to the authority of his quoted records&#146;  (ibid., 90). As members tired of his wordy interventions and even began to ridicule him, he began to moderate his views, resolving to follow reason and law rather than passion. A sense of humour would have been a great asset to him. The king, always looking for the support of moderates, offered D'Ewes a baronetcy, which was conferred upon him on 15 July 1641. Any pleasure he took from this was short-lived, for about a fortnight later his beloved wife, still under thirty, died of smallpox while he was in London. From Ixworth Abbey, D'Ewes's stepmother sent her gravely sick daughter-in-law home to Stow Hall, and the journey proved fatal. She was presumably buried in Stowlangtoft church that August, but the register is incomplete. Their five sons all died in infancy, but two of five daughters survived: Cecilia, who married Sir Thomas Darcy but had no children, and Isolda, who never married. A year later D'Ewes married another heiress, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1656), daughter of Sir Henry Willoughby, bt, of Risley, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>When the civil war began D'Ewes joined the parliamentary side and took the solemn league and covenant, albeit with reservations, in 1643. It had already caused comment in the house that his brother Richard was a lieutenant-colonel in the royalist army (mortally wounded during the siege of Reading), and D'Ewes's views were too moderate for him to be entirely trusted. He soon tired of taking notes of parliamentary business, not enjoying the stormy debating sessions which took place during the conflict, and his last notes are dated December 1645. That year he was nominated as co-chairman of the tenth (Blackbourn) division of the Suffolk classical presbytery meeting at Ixworth. On 6 December 1648 D'Ewes was excluded from the house with forty others at Pride's Purge. He never returned, perhaps glad to escape duties which had become distasteful to him, and he moved to Great Russell Street, London, cultivated the acquaintance of Archbishop Ussher, and concentrated on his antiquarian and collecting pursuits, planning more great works. On 7 March 1650 a son, Willoughby (1650&#150;1685), was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, at last giving Simonds the male heir he so much desired. But on 18 April next Simonds died at Great Russell Street, and was carried off to Suffolk on 29 May to be buried in the chancel at Stowlangtoft on 7 June. Here his widow presumably joined him when she died in 1656. It is strange that they have no memorial there, for D'Ewes had provided a window and a brass commemorating D'Ewes forebears in other churches; he sent John Weever illustrations and descriptions for <span class="italic">Ancient Funerall Monuments</span> (1631). The infant Willoughby succeeded his father as second baronet and lived quietly on his estates, as, less prosperously, did his son and grandson, and the title became extinct in 1731.<h2>
<a name="ThefateofDEwesscollections"></a>The fate of D'Ewes's collections</h2>D'Ewes died without having published anything beyond a few speeches and a dull essay, <span class="italic">The Primitive Practice for Preserving Truth</span> (1645). He was concerned that his collections should stay in the family and that scholars should always have access to them, but in 1705 his grandson Simonds, third baronet, disposed of the library for &pound;450 through Humphrey Wanley, agent for Sir Robert Harley, later earl of Oxford; the vendor never knew who the buyer was. D'Ewes's books were swallowed up by Harley's, and were dispersed when the earl's books were sold in the 1740s. The manuscripts, which Wanley called &#145;a rhapsody of indigested notes&#146;  (Watson, 13), now account for about one-twelfth of the Harley MSS in the British Library, accessible chiefly through the Harley catalogues and A. G. Watson's <span class="italic">Library of Sir Simonds D'Ewes</span> (1966). At the heart of the collection D'Ewes's 563 original rolls and 7800 charters form two-thirds of Harley's eventual holdings. The miscellaneous collection embraces everything from D'Ewes's school exercises and letters to his family to voluminous transcripts from cartularies, monastic registers, and early wills and records. The public and private muniments which he so energetically extracted constitute valuable source material for the history of English antiquities and law. His planned Anglo-Saxon dictionary (with Francis Junius) and works on Greek and Roman coinage almost came to fruition, but he always had too many projects in hand at once. His Cambridge journal was last seen in 1859, and unfortunately J. E. B. Mayor's transcript has also disappeared. J. H. Marsden's <span class="italic">College Life in the Time of James the First</span> (1851) is too loosely based on the original to be an entirely useful substitute. J. O. Halliwell published <span class="italic">The Autobiography and Correspondence of Sir Simonds D'Ewes during the Reign of James I and Charles I</span> in 1845: it covers his life to 1636, omitting some parts of D'Ewes's lengthy narrative without loss, and adding a few interesting letters. These memoirs give clear and often lively accounts of the periods they cover, and D'Ewes wrote about his relations with insight and compassion. His personal diaries, some in Latin and some in cipher, extend from January 1622 to April 1624, and from January 1643 to March 1647; only the first has been published. He knew all the great antiquaries, but, unlike such men as Selden, Twysden, Dugdale, and Holdsworth, D'Ewes lacked flair and creativity; he was a copyist and collector, conscientious, industrious, and usually accurate. He was not above disparaging the work of others, sneering at Selden and finding fault with Camden. Thomas Fuller, of the <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, can have the last word:<blockquote>He was bred in Cambridge as appeared by his printed speech (made in the Long Parliament) wherein he indeavoured to prove it more Ancient than Oxford. His Genious addicted him to the study of Antiquity. Preferring Rust before Brightness, and more conforming his mind to the Garbe of the former than [the] mode of the moderne times. (Fuller, 75)</blockquote>
