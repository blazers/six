<span class="headword">Strachey,  William</span>  (1572&#150;1621), <span class="occ">historian of Virginia</span>, was born on 4 April 1572 in Saffron Walden, Essex, the son of William Strachey (<i>d</i>. 1598) and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke) (<i>d</i>. 1587). Nothing is known about Strachey's childhood and early education, but at the age of sixteen he was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. By 1605 he was a member of Gray's Inn in London, but there is no evidence that he practised law. Instead, he seems to have supported himself from the proceeds of his father's estate, which he inherited in 1602 following a legal wrangle with his stepmother, Elizabeth Brockett.<br>
<br>Strachey's keen interest in literature and the theatre brought him into close contact with several of the leading literary lights of his day, including Ben Jonson, Thomas Campion, and William Shakespeare. The latter would later make use of Strachey's accounts of Virginia when writing <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. Strachey's earliest writings were poems, two of which were published in 1604 and 1605 in works prepared by Francis Mitchell and Ben Jonson. By 1605 Strachey was experiencing serious financial problems. He seems to have earned no income from his literary activities and quickly ran through the money he had inherited from his father. In 1606 he took paid employment as the secretary to Thomas Glover, the English ambassador to Constantinople. He was dismissed from that post in March 1607 and returned to London in the hope of being able to find a similar position in another Mediterranean country. His efforts proved fruitless, and in 1609, almost in desperation, he bought two shares in the Virginia Company of London. His intention was to seek his fortune in the as yet still fragile colony founded by the English two years earlier on the banks of the James River.<br>
<br>Strachey set sail for Virginia in June 1609 in the fleet commanded by Sir George Somer. He was a passenger on the <i>Sea Venture</i>, captained by Christopher Newport, which ran aground in the Bermudas following a hurricane. Newport and his group were trapped on the island for almost a year. During that time they managed to construct two small boats, in which they eventually made their way to Virginia. Strachey's report of this episode, together with his account of the precarious state of the settlement at Jamestown, which he wrote in 1610, was suppressed by the Virginia Company. It was first published in 1625, after the company's collapse, by Samuel Purchas in his <span class="italic">Pilgrims</span>.<br>
<br>Strachey had set out for Virginia without holding any official position, but in 1609 he replaced Matthew Scrivener, who had died by drowning, as the Virginia Company's secretary to the colony. A year later the company asked him to write an account of the colony and its future prospects. He returned to London in 1611, and it was there that he commenced writing <span class="italic">The Historie of Travell into Virginia Britania</span>. Although Strachey provided an eyewitness account of life in early Virginia, his manuscript borrowed heavily from the work of earlier authors, including Richard Willes, James Rosier, and John Smith. He completed the first version of his work, which was dedicated to the earl of Northumberland, in 1612, and during the next six years produced two more versions of his <span class="italic">Historie</span>. Strachey's <span class="italic">Historie</span> was as critical of Virginia as the report he wrote in 1610, and for that reason the Virginia Company refused to publish it. The work was first published in 1849 by the Hakluyt Society.<br>
<br>Strachey's career and family life following his return to England are shrouded in mystery, although he probably lived and worked in London. He had married his first wife, Frances Forster, on 9 June 1595. Their two children, William and Edmund, were born in 1596 and 1604, respectively. Following Frances's death, at some time before 1615, he remarried. All that is known about his second wife is that she was a widow named Dorothy. There is no record of any children being born to them. William Strachey died of unknown causes in June 1621 and was buried in St Giles, Camberwell, Surrey.<br>
