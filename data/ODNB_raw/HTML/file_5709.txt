</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clotworthy,  John</span>, first Viscount Massereene  (<em>d.</em> 1665), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son and heir of Sir Hugh Clotworthy (<i>d</i>. 1630), descended from the Devon family of that name, and Mary, daughter of Roger Langford of co. Antrim, Ireland. His father, a soldier&#150;adventurer of Massereene, co. Antrim, served as sheriff of the county, and his mother was the &#145;worthy matron&#146; from whom Clotworthy appears to have inherited his religious principles  (Adair, 191). Nothing is known of his education but he was a representative of the new generation of settlers in Ireland and was knighted in 1626. He was closely associated with the plantation of Ulster and his kinsmen Edward Rowley and Tristram Beresford were two of the leading agents for the investment of the guilds of London. Clotworthy himself owned a 61-year lease of the Drapers' proportion, and possessed an extensive estate in Antrim, which county he represented in the Dublin parliament of 1634. Before 1643 he married Margaret (<i>fl</i>. 1638&#150;1683), daughter of Roger Jones, first Viscount Ranelagh. This union confirmed his position among the New English opponents of Viscount Wentworth, lord deputy of Ireland. His father-in-law was a close political ally of Richard Boyle, earl of Cork. His wife, like Sir John himself, was a presbyterian, and suffered imprisonment at the lord deputy's hands for her beliefs. Clotworthy was a leading patron of hardline protestant ministers, and was said to have once remarked that &#145;the conversion of the papists in Ireland was only to be effected by the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in one hand and the sword in the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His close friendship with leading Scottish preachers and planters, and his refusal to relinquish his private monopoly of licensing taverns, wines, and whiskey in counties Down and Antrim, set him and Wentworth further at odds. Their differences only deepened when the lord deputy refused to grant Clotworthy a commission in the company of horse previously commanded by his father, aggravating a long-running grievance which Clotworthy nurtured in the face of repeated failure on the part of the government to make good on promises of a military command. So uncomfortable was his situation by 1635 that Clotworthy apparently discussed emigration to Massachusetts with John Winthrop's son. In 1637 he put together a bid for control over the Londonderry plantation which had been forfeited to the crown in 1635. Blocked by Wentworth nothing came of it, and ultimately Clotworthy found himself stripped of his interest in the Drapers' lands to boot.<br>
<br>Clotworthy's landed interests in Ireland brought him into close contact with Scottish presbyterian interests, and it was reported by Wentworth in 1638 that when Clotworthy went to the king to promote his scheme for the resettlement of Londonderry he had in fact travelled first to Edinburgh &#145;to see what becomes of the kirk&#146;  (Donald, 191). It would appear that he acted as a conduit between the Scottish covenanters and the puritan circles in England by helping to organize the opposition to the personal rule. When eventually he made it to London, he wrote letters of intelligence&#151;and, at the behest of his English contacts, advice and encouragement&#151;to his friends at Edinburgh, some of which were intercepted. Clotworthy was back in Dublin in August 1639 and in the following year he was returned to the Short Parliament for the Cornish borough of Bossiney (perhaps on the interest of Francis Russell, earl of Bedford). In September 1640 he took a prominent role in organizing the circulation of the petition of the twelve peers calling on the king to summon a new parliament. In November he took his seat in the Long Parliament as one of the representatives for the Essex borough of Maldon, possibly on the interest of the local magnate Robert Rich, the earl of Warwick. In February and March 1641 he lobbied hard for the appointment of Warwick's half-brother, the earl of Holland, as lord deputy of Ireland in place of Wentworth, now the earl of Strafford.<br>
<br>Within days of the Long Parliament's sitting, on 3 November 1640 Clotworthy had seconded his kinsman Pym's motion for the appointment of a committee of the whole house to consider Irish affairs, and had given a speech alerting parliament to the dangers threatening from Ireland, warning that a popish army was &#145;ready to march where I know not&#146;  (D'Ewes, 13&#150;14). He &#145;became the principal intermediary between the English, Scottish and Irish malcontents&#146;  (Ohlmeyer, &#145;Strafford&#146;, 226) and was very prominent in the attack on Strafford, helping to orchestrate the case against him while testifying himself several times, particularly in connection with Strafford's attempt to improve Irish linen manufacture. Archbishop Laud dubbed him &#145;a firebrand brought from Ireland to inflame this kingdom&#146;  (ibid.). The Irish plot to seize Dublin Castle was discovered when an attempt was made to recruit Clotworthy's own servant, Owen O'Connolly. Sir John adventured &pound;1000 for the recovery of Ireland and in 1645 he sat on the parliamentary committee for the relief of that kingdom. He fought against the rebels in person at the head of his own regiment in 1642&#150;3, relieving the English held captive at Moneymore, co. Londonderry, and capturing Mountjoy, Tyrone. His men were also involved in an atrocity which was investigated at the Restoration, when Clotworthy justified the execution of 100 MacDonnell rebels on the grounds that many of his troops were Campbells, the clan's sworn and unswerving enemies.<br>
<br>In 1643 Clotworthy moved the inclusion of Ireland within the solemn league and covenant. But having helped engineer the Anglo-Scottish alliance he became disaffected from the war party leadership when command of the British forces in Ireland was entrusted to the Scotsman Robert Monro. From 1645 Clotworthy sat on the committee of both kingdoms and took part in the prosecution of Laud, goading the former archbishop on the very scaffold where he died. In October 1646 he went to Dublin to negotiate with Ormond for the city's surrender to parliament, but returned unsuccessful in February 1647. He was a commissioner to negotiate with the army that spring. It was he who brought to the Commons a copy of the soldiers' petition which led to the declaration of dislike and the New Model Army's entry into politics. His association with the presbyterian faction at Westminster brought down on him charges of embezzlement, obstructing the lord lieutenancy of Viscount Lisle, and treacherous dealings with Ormond, as part of the army's impeachment of the eleven members. Clotworthy and his fellow targets sought unsuccessfully to vindicate themselves. Taking flight for the Netherlands, he was intercepted just outside Calais by a frigate under parliamentary command and brought back to Dover. However, he was then &#145;dismissed, and reached the Continent in safety&#146;  (Reid, 2.81). On 28 January 1648 he was disabled from sitting in the Commons any longer. But his expulsion, and the election of a successor, Henry Mildmay, were reversed on 26 June amid the presbyterian revanche which coincided with the second civil war and Clotworthy's return to England. Purged once more in December, his expulsion was renewed and he was subsequently placed under arrest on a charge of complicity in the Scottish invasion the previous summer. He remained a prisoner until November 1651, and after his release lay very low. In 1653 he was living at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and that year over 11,000 acres of the forfeited estates of the marquess of Antrim were allotted to him in requital of his original investment in the Irish adventure. He then promptly doubled his landholdings, principally in the baronies of Massereene and Dunluce, by the purchase of further lots in the latter. In all, he spent &pound;5441 acquiring the greatest estate in the county. On 6 August 1654 Cromwell appointed him one of the committee established to determine differences among the adventurers for Irish land, and in the same year Clotworthy personally interceded with Fleetwood and the council at Dublin on behalf of the presbyterian ministers of Antrim and Down. This initiated a series of talks which resulted, after the arrival of Henry Cromwell, in the ministers' acceptance of government salaries in November 1655. The tide of affairs now turned. Clotworthy resumed prominence on the county benches of Antrim and Down. In 1655 his presentation to livings in Antrim marked the revival of lay patronage in the appointment of ministers in Ireland. In 1656 he proposed the establishment of a college at Antrim&#151;perhaps a reflection of his association with the fringes of the Hartlib circle&#151;to be headed by a prominent Scottish presbyterian.<br>
<br>Clotworthy was instrumental in promoting the Stuart restoration. Elected to represent co. Antrim in the Irish convention, in March 1660 he was sent to England (where the council of state had itself appointed him a commissioner for the government of Ireland) to represent the interests of the adventurers and the soldiers settled in the kingdom. He proposed an act confirming all estates of soldiers and adventurers as they stood on 7 May 1659. The order that he return to Ireland to take up his responsibilities there was a rebuff for this proposal. Back in Dublin he obtained a new appointment as a messenger to England. Once there he sought to influence the drawing of the convention's <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity and Oblivion</span> in order to exclude from its provisions all Catholic rebels in Ireland, thereby tying the hands of a monarch he and others rightly suspected of a desire to indulge influential papists in Ireland such as the marquess of Antrim. On 21 November 1660 Clotworthy was created Viscount Massereene and Baron of Loughneagh. On 1 December he entered the Irish privy council. He was a commissioner for the court of claims, but was unable to prevent a ruling in 1663 restoring Antrim's estates to him. Riots in the region of Dunluce ensued, possibly instigated by Massereene's kinsman Tristram Beresford. Massereene remained resolute in his opposition to the restoration of episcopacy &#145;though he knew well that his vote would signify nothing towards it&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and staunchly defended the presbyterians of Ulster before his colleagues in the privy council at Dublin. Clarendon commended his sincerity, which was unquestionable, as also his &#145;generous and jovial&#146; character, and his loyalty to the royal service  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Massereene was <i>custos rotulorum</i> in co. Londonderry in 1663, and became a fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May that year. He and the earl of Anglesey held a contract for the reclamation of marsh lands around Dublin, and shortly before his death Massereene secured for the town of Antrim the right to hold fairs, and to return two burgesses to the Irish parliament. He died at Dublin on 23 September 1665; his widow was still alive in 1683. Their only child, Mary, married Sir John Skeffington, bt, to whom the title of Massereene descended in 1665.<br>
