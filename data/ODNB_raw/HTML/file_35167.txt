<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray,  John</span>  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">educationist and politician</span>, was born on 28 February 1879 at Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the eldest son of Francis Robert Murray, fish curer, and his wife, Isabella Watt. He was educated at Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen. In 1896 he entered the University of Aberdeen as first bursar, graduating in 1900 with honours in Greek and Latin, having won the Simpson Greek prize and the Seafield Latin medal. In 1901 he went up as an exhibitioner to Christ Church, Oxford, on a Fullerton scholarship. He took first-class honours in classical moderations in 1903 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1905. In the same year he was elected prize fellow of Merton College, and in 1908 student and tutor of his old college, Christ Church, where in 1910 he became censor. Murray published nothing except the occasional political piece in the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> (which he edited from 1911 to 1914) during his years as a don, but the Oxford system of education had made a lasting impression.<br>
<br>In 1915 Murray left Oxford to join the labour department of the newly created Ministry of Munitions. By the end of the war he had reached the fairly senior rank of assistant commissioner in the labour adviser's department. In the general election of December 1918 he stood as a Coalition Liberal in Leeds West, and was elected with a large majority. He was soon given minor administrative work to do as officer in charge of a section of the Board of Education concerned with university awards to former servicemen. In 1920&#150;21 he was chairman of the central committee on trusts, a body set up under the <span class="roman">Profiteering Acts</span>, 1919&#150;20. The committee had powers to investigate and report on price increases, and during Murray's chairmanship published a large number of brief reports, on which little or no action was taken.<br>
<br>In 1921 Murray married Ellen, widow of George Harwood (1845&#150;1912), Liberal MP for Bolton, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33980/', "Sir Alfred Hopkinson (1851&#150;1939)")</script>. He thereby became stepfather to her two daughters, including gthe biographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97074/', "Georgina Battiscombe")</script>. In 1922 he stood as a national (Lloyd George) Liberal in Leeds West and retained his seat by a narrow majority in a straight fight against Labour, but in 1923, when the Conservatives fielded a candidate, Murray came third, at the bottom of the poll. In 1924 he retreated to Kirkcaldy, but succeeded only in reducing the Labour majority. He fought a by-election in the safe Conservative seat of Ripon in 1925, his last attempt to re-enter parliament. Murray was never a leading member of the Liberal Party, but during his brief parliamentary career he spoke lucidly and with originality; in happier days for Liberals he would undoubtedly have achieved office. His speeches in the house showed a certain radicalism: he favoured sympathetic treatment of the unemployed and was an early (and lifelong) advocate of family allowances. In later years he described himself as an individualist and associated with Sir Ernest Benn in the Society of Individualists. Already in the by-election at Ripon in 1925 he had openly disagreed with Lloyd George's plans for nationalization of land and the coal industry, and privately expressed his dislike of what he called &#145;promise-politics&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1926, after nearly three years in the political wilderness, Murray was appointed principal of the University College of the South West, Exeter, in succession to W. H. Moberly. Although Murray at first hoped to return to politics one day, he was to spend the rest of his working life in the service of the University College, declining in 1929 the vice-chancellorship of the University of Sheffield. He inherited a college with cramped buildings and few endowments, partly engaged in training teachers for elementary schools, but mostly preparing students for external degrees of the University of London. The college had two assets: recognition by the University Grants Committee as a grant-receiving institution; and a magnificent and almost empty site of 150 acres on the north-western outskirts of Exeter. It was Murray's object to develop these assets until the college became a full university. The first need was money. Murray plunged happily into the business of fund-raising, which he likened to &#145;a perpetual by-election&#146;. While he was principal the substantial sum of &pound;250,000 was raised for buildings, scholarships, and chairs. He was not the man to suffer a fool gladly&#151;unless a prospective benefactor: the largest benefaction ever received by the college was owing to Murray's tact, firmness, and inexhaustible patience exercised over a period of fourteen years in the face of considerable provocation. Murray sought to combine in Exeter the merits of Oxford and Aberdeen: he promoted the Oxford system of residence and of tutorial teaching and he envisaged Exeter as providing for poor English boys and girls the educational ladder that Aberdeen offered to aspiring Scotsmen like himself. In addition he strove to provide an international dimension to the college by attracting students from Europe, the United States, Africa, and the Middle East. In all this he had considerable success, but the final prize&#151;a university charter&#151;eluded him. He retired, unwillingly, in 1951. Murray received three honorary doctorates: LLD from Aberdeen (1930), LittD from Columbia, New York (1939), and, fittingly, DLitt from Exeter (1956), conferred at the first degree congregation held by the new university that he had done much to foster. In 1963 the University of Exeter named a new hall of residence Murray House in his honour, though with accommodation for 150 students it was built on a larger scale than he would have thought desirable.<br>
<br>Murray was eloquent, formidable, autocratic, and in his later years careless of administrative forms. He gave time and money generously to help students and staff. He wrote occasionally for the <span class="italic">Hibbert Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> and circulated privately a humorous fantasy <span class="italic">Shinid</span> (1938) in celebration of English hospitality in an Irish setting. He was a staunch Christian and as a member of the De La Warr committee on higher education in east Africa in 1936&#150;7 wrote a minority report opposing secular education there; in his view the mission schools should have continued to monopolize popular education even in territories three-quarters non-Christian&#151;&#145;an educated pagan is a pagan still&#146;. Murray died in London on 28 December 1964.<br>
