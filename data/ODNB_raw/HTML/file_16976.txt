<span class="headword">Long,  Samuel</span>  (1638&#150;1683), <span class="occ">planter and politician in the West Indies</span>, was born in Wiltshire, the second son of Timothy Long (1610&#150;1691) and his wife, Jane, the only daughter of Oliver Brunsell, the vicar of Wroughton. Nothing of his early life is known, except that on 20 October 1661 he married Elizabeth Streete.<br>
<br>Long participated in the conquest of Jamaica, as a lieutenant in Colonel Edward D'Oyley's regiment, led by Admiral William Penn and General Robert Venables in 1655. He acted as secretary to the commissioners, which placed him at the centre of political affairs in the new colony and which may explain the considerable land grants he received after the war. As one of the largest landowners in the island, he subsequently played an instrumental role in limiting the prerogative powers of the royal governors and in championing the corporate rights of the elected assembly. He was elected as a member for Port Royal in the first meeting of an assembly, in which he served as clerk in 1664. He was later chosen speaker in four successive assemblies from 1672 to 1675. On the last occasion he was nominated by the members, not the governor, which henceforth became the established practice. He was sworn a member of the council and was appointed chief justice in 1674. He played a crucial role in ensuring the support of the council for the constitutional claims of the assembly against the governors. He said of his political stance that &#145;he asked nor desired nothing but his rights and privileges as an Englishman&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 10, no. 1512) which included the right of the assembly to enjoy the same privileges in Jamaica as the House of Commons. He believed that the assembly alone should have the right to tax the colony, and he anticipated many claims later contended by the North Americans during the American War of Independence, saying &#145;that His Majesty's commission was no law to them, and that there might be that which was unlawful in such commissions&#146;  (ibid., <i>1677&#150;80</i>, no. 270). After the meeting of the first assembly in 1664 he was charged with treason primarily because of his success, with his ally and fellow planter William Beeston, in the passage of three acts which gave the legislature, not the governor, control of the revenue even before these powers were assumed by the House of Commons. The charges against him were dropped in recognition of the popularity of his stance. He was the first speaker to request the privileges of the house, possibly as early as 1672. He consolidated his earlier success with the alteration of the <span class="roman">Revenue Act</span>, in which the king's name was removed and the assembly won more control over the revenue, in 1675. He similarly orchestrated the reduction of the military powers of the governor in the <span class="roman">Militia Act</span> of 1677. He foiled the &#145;new frame&#146; of government in 1678 in which the imperial authorities attempted to recover the powers lost to the assembly and to undo his work. His opposition to the proposed changes caused his suspension from the council and his dismissal as chief justice. He was arrested with William Beeston and sent to England in 1680. He used the opportunity not only to gain his acquittal but to contrive a deal with the lords of trade in which the assembly passed a permanent <span class="roman">Revenue Act</span> in return for the guarantee of existing laws giving control of the revenue to the assembly. He acted informally as the colony's agent in London and obtained permission for a permanent agent to represent Jamaica in Britain. He died in Jamaica on 28 June 1683 and was buried in the parish of St Katherine's. He had accumulated seven plantations, 11,183 acres in six parishes, and 288 slaves. He kept a particularly splendid residence in the capital at Spanish Town, far more elaborate than his plantation houses, which had a hall large enough for sixty chairs and seven tables. His career was synonymous with the rise of the sugar planters who dominated island politics. He and Beeston had created an assembly in Jamaica which surpassed the claims of peer institutions in North America even though the island did not rebel in 1776.<br>
