<span class="headword">Warenne,  William (I)  de</span>, first earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [Earl Warenne]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1088), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was among the inner circle of Norman lords of Duke William's generation whose campaigns over some forty years consolidated the duchy and conquered England.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlycareer"></a>Background and early career</h2>William's father, Rodulf or Ralph de Warenne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1074), was a minor Norman magnate with lands near Rouen and in the Pays de Caux, and William's earlier ancestry has long been debated. In the twelfth century the Warennes were believed to be descended from a niece of Gunnor, the wife of Duke Richard (I) of Normandy (<i>d</i>. 996) and the person seen as the linchpin of the wider ducal kin. He was certainly related in some way to them, since Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, later prohibited the proposed marriage of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28737/', "William (II) de Warenne")</script> to a bastard daughter of Henry I on the grounds of their blood relationship. The most likely interpretation of the fragmentary evidence is that either William (I)'s mother or his paternal grandmother was Duchess Gunnor's niece Beatrice. Probably in his father's time the family adopted a surname from the village of Varenne, on the river of that name inland from Dieppe.<br>
<br>William owed his eventual standing more to his own capabilities than to family connections or inherited wealth. By the mid 1050s, though still young, he was capable and experienced enough to be given joint command of a Norman army. His first recorded military action, during a period in which the Normans were constantly at war, was in the Mortemer campaign of 1054, as one of the leaders of the army which defeated the French. His reward was a swathe of lands which had belonged to his disgraced kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19351/', "Roger (I) de Mortimer")</script>. Although some of the lands were soon restored to the Mortimers, William kept the important castles at Mortemer and Bellencombre. The latter, less than a day's ride from Varenne, became the capital of the Warenne estates in Normandy. At almost the same time he was further rewarded with lands confiscated in 1053 from William, count of Arques. The continuing confidence with which the duke regarded him kept William at the forefront of Norman affairs over the next two decades, and he was among those consulted when the expedition to England in 1066 was planned.<h2>
<a name="ServiceandrewardsinEngland"></a>Service and rewards in England</h2>William de Warenne is among the handful of Normans known for certain to have fought at Hastings, and in 1067 was one of four men left in charge in England when the king returned to Normandy. His role as a military commander continued to be important for another twenty years, suggesting a physical constitution as robust as the king's. In 1075 he and Richard de Clare were delegated to deal with the rebellion of Earl Ralph de Gael of East Anglia. The two first summoned the earl to attend the king's court to answer for an act of defiance, then mustered an army which defeated the rebels at Fawdon in south Cambridgeshire, mutilating their prisoners after the battle. Ralph retreated to Norwich, where Warenne and Clare began a siege which lasted three months but failed to prevent the earl's escape by boat. In the early 1080s William campaigned with the king's forces in Maine.<br>
<br>William de Warenne's rewards in England were very large, elevating him into the first rank of the magnates. By 1086 he was the fourth richest tenant-in-chief, surpassed only by the king's half-brothers and his long-standing comrade and kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23953/', "Roger de Montgomery")</script>. Such riches were accumulated over the course of the reign. The earliest acquisitions were presumably in Sussex, where he held the rape of Lewes, one of the five territories into which the shire was divided. The town of Lewes, a flourishing port on a tidal estuary, was divided between William and the king. One or the other built a castle there which became the capital of the Warenne lands in England. The original castle may have lain south of the town, where William is known to have reconstructed the church of St Pancras, and where a large mound may represent the motte. If that was the first site, it was abandoned in the 1070s when Warenne founded a priory there around the existing church. He would then have built the present castle north of the town, remarkable for having two mottes, one at each end of the bailey.<br>
<br>The rape of Lewes as first created for William de Warenne may have stretched from the River Adur on the west to the River Ouse on the east, and indeed beyond the Ouse at its northern extremity. Before 1073, however, the rapes were reorganized. A new rape west of Lewes was created for William (I) de Briouze, to whom Warenne surrendered seventeen manors. On the east, twenty-eight manors in four hundreds beyond the Ouse were transferred to the count of Mortain's rape of Pevensey. In compensation for those losses Warenne received lands in East Anglia.<br>
<br>William's second acquisition may have been the large estate of Conisbrough in Yorkshire, an important manor which occupied the gap between the marshes at the head of the Humber estuary and the Pennine foothills, and commanded the fords where the main road north crossed the River Don. Conisbrough was an old royal manor which had belonged to Earl Harold, and it seems likely that it was transferred to Warenne during the campaign against the English rebels at York in 1068.<br>
<br>Far more important than Conisbrough, and overshadowing even the rape of Lewes in 1086, were William's lands in eastern England. In Norfolk, especially the west of the county, he was the largest landowner in a large and wealthy shire, and his manors there were complemented by others which spilled over the county boundary and through the western side of Suffolk and Essex as far as the Thames estuary and reached into south-east Cambridgeshire. The centre was at Castle Acre, where Warenne built not a castle but a large stone manor house (it was fortified only in the twelfth century). The estates in those four eastern shires were clearly acquired in stages. Some had belonged to Earl Harold and might have been handed over soon after 1066. Another group, before the conquest the possessions of a thegn called Toki, had fallen first to Warenne's Flemish brother-in-law Frederic, and after Frederic's death in 1070 came to William through his wife. He may not have controlled them directly until she died in 1085. Others seem to have been given to him in the aftermath of the 1075 rebellion, while the series of exchanges for parts of the original rape of Lewes may still have been going on in the 1080s.<h2>
<a name="Estatesandtheirmanagement"></a>Estates and their management</h2>In 1086 the eastern shires accounted for half the value of Warenne's estate (more than half of that being in Norfolk), and Sussex two fifths. The other tenth, which included Conisbrough, was scattered about the country in little parcels: a single manor in Hampshire, another in Buckinghamshire, Kimbolton and its outliers in Huntingdonshire and Bedfordshire, a couple of estates on the Thames near Wallingford, two small manors in south Lincolnshire, some fishermen in Wisbech. The rationale for their dispersal is not easy to discern, and it may be wrong to look for any single all-inclusive purpose. Several besides Conisbrough had belonged to Earl Harold, including Kimbolton and the Lincolnshire manors; indeed outside Wessex only Warenne and Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester, were given Harold's property. At least one of the manors furthest from William's bases in Sussex and Norfolk had strategic importance: his Hampshire property was Fratton on Portsea Island, watching the entrance to Portsmouth harbour.<br>
<br>William's dispositions of his landed estate suggest that he was a good organizer greedy for further spoils. Almost everywhere except Sussex he pushed at the limits of what he had been given, testing what more he could either claim legitimately, or simply take without opposition. Some of his extra acquisitions were peaceful enough, like the large manor of Whitchurch in Shropshire, which his distant cousin Roger de Montgomery gave him. But others were not. In Norfolk especially he asserted his lordship over freemen who might or might not have been assigned to him, leading to the many counterclaims and disputes recorded in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. He was active even in shires where he was far less powerful. In Essex he stole land from the bishop of Durham and the abbot of Ely, and in Sussex from the nuns of Wilton; in Yorkshire he was at loggerheads with several of his neighbours about what properties were sokelands of Conisbrough; in Bedfordshire he won over the English thegn Augi from the Norman lord to whom the king had assigned him, and when Augi died took control of land which ought perhaps have gone to Augi's lord's successor; in Huntingdonshire in 1086 he staked some sort of a claim to a manor held by Hugh de Bolbec.<br>
<br>Warenne was wealthy enough not to need to concentrate his resources in just one or two parts of the country, and the pattern of demesne estates which he created after granting others to his men had the deliberate effect of accentuating its dispersal and shifting the balance towards Sussex rather than Norfolk. Whereas the ratios of manorial values in 1086 over the honour as a whole, between eastern England, Sussex, and the rest, were 49:41:10, what William chose to retain in his own hands was balanced 33:48:20. In Sussex he kept only four manors, but far and away the four largest, whereas in Norfolk he was not so choosy. Elsewhere he retained under his direct control one manor in each of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, the core of Kimbolton, and all of Conisbrough.<br>
<br>William's options may have been constrained by a lack of close lieutenants to whom he was willing to give a great deal of land and authority. Despite his gains in Normandy in the 1050s his lands there were not very extensive, and he did not succeed to any part of his paternal inheritance until at least the mid-1070s. His father was still alive in 1074 and there was an older brother, Rodulf or Ralph, who inherited probably the greater part of their father's estates. Some of William's tenants in England, including the ancestors of the families of Cailly, Chesney, Grandcourt, Pierrepont, Rosay, and Wancy, can be traced back to fiefs around his Norman capital of Bellencombre, but they were only a small minority of the fifty or more men to whom William gave lands. Some others were perhaps his Norman kinsmen: Tezelin and Lambert, for instance, had unusual forenames which are known to have been used in other branches of Beatrice's family. Only a handful of his leading men held in both the eastern counties and the rape of Lewes, and the wealth which William had at his disposal was widely distributed.<br>
<br>Warenne's vigour in running his estates is evident from improvements in their economic condition. It seems that he took an interest in running his manors not just efficiently but aggressively, and that he was good at choosing capable reeves and bailiffs. Conisbrough was well stocked with ploughteams and intensively cultivated by Yorkshire standards, and, almost uniquely in a county devastated by warfare, more than doubled in value between 1066 and 1086. Values on the four demesne manors in Sussex also went up sharply after William acquired them, and at Castle Acre he more than tripled the size of his sheep flock.<h2>
<a name="FoundationofLewesPriory"></a>Foundation of Lewes Priory</h2>Despite an evil reputation at Ely, where it was later believed, or at any rate hoped, that Warenne's departing soul had been claimed by demons, William was at least conventionally pious. The story of the foundation of Lewes Priory by William and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11736/', "Gundrada de Warenne (d. 1085)")</script>, was preserved there only in much later traditions, but in essence it is believable. Probably at an early stage William consulted Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury. Later, William and Gundrada went on pilgrimage to Rome, but reached no further than the great Burgundian abbey of Cluny because of the war in Italy between the pope and the emperor. Their journey probably took place within the period 1081&#150;3 rather than at the date of 1077 assigned to it elsewhere. At Cluny the couple were received into the fellowship of the monks and resolved to found an English priory following the rule of Cluny. After difficulties and one false start, it was accomplished under a prior and three monks sent from Cluny. The monastery was established around the existing church of St Pancras in the suburbs of Lewes, it was well endowed, and an ambitious building programme was put in train. Lewes was the first house of Cluniac monks in England and the precursor of several others, and the importance of the Warennes' role in their arrival needs to be stressed.<br>
<br>William clearly regarded Lewes Priory as his spiritual home, and had both Gundrada and himself buried there. It was also a focus for the spiritual aspirations of his men, at least one of whom entered the priory as a monk and donated the manor which he had held as William's tenant. When he died, William was planning to establish a second priory at Castle Acre, a project brought to fruition by his son William (II).<h2>
<a name="Earldomdeathandfamily"></a>Earldom, death, and family</h2>In the turmoil which enveloped England after the death of William the Conqueror in September 1087, William de Warenne stood firm by William Rufus. His reward, some time between Christmas 1087 and the end of March 1088, was the titular earldom of Surrey and very probably three valuable Surrey manors, Reigate, Dorking, and Shere. Warenne fought for the king during the invasion of England by supporters of Robert Curthose and was wounded by an arrow during the siege of Pevensey Castle in spring 1088. He was carried to Lewes and died there of his wounds on 24 June.<br>
<br>William's first wife was the Flemish noblewoman Gundrada, whom he married <i>c</i>.1066. They had at least three children and she died in childbirth in 1085. He then married a sister, name unknown, of Richard Gouet, a landowner in the Perche region. Her attempt to make restitution for the damage which he had inflicted upon Ely Abbey by a gift of 100 shillings a few days after his death was refused by the monks. William's elder son, William (II), succeeded him in England and Normandy; his younger son Reynold inherited Gundrada's Flemish lands. A nephew, Roger, son of Erneis, was first a knight in the household of Earl Hugh of Chester and later a monk of St Evroult, where he told the historian Orderic Vitalis much about the family.<br>
<br>William's remains were reburied in a leaden chest at Lewes Priory during rebuilding there <i>c</i>.1145, from where they were disinterred during railway construction in 1845. In 1847 they were placed alongside Gundrada's remains in the parish church of St John, Southover, in Lewes, where they still rest.<br>
