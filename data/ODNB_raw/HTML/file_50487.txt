<span class="headword">Wilson,  William  Carus</span>  (1791&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and founder of charity schools</span>, was born on 7 July 1791 at Heversham, Westmorland, the eldest of the eight surviving children of William Carus (1764&#150;1851) of Casterton Hall, Westmorland, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter and heir of Benjamin Shipphard of Natland, Westmorland. His father, MP for Cockermouth (1821&#150;6), added Wilson to his surname on inheriting the Casterton estates from his aunt in 1793. Two of William Carus Wilson's three brothers became clergyman.<br>
<br>Privately educated&#151;including tuition by the evangelical John Fawcett of Carlisle&#151;to the age of nineteen, Carus Wilson was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1810 and graduated BA in 1815 (MA, 1818). He married Anne (1785/6&#150;1859), daughter of Major-General Charles Neville, on 31 January 1815. On applying to become a clergyman he was warned by Charles Simeon that his views were &#145;unduly Calvinistic&#146;  (Barker, 860), and Dr Law, bishop of Chester, to whom he first applied for ordination, rejected him for this reason.<br>
<br>In 1816, following ordination by the archbishop of York, Carus Wilson was presented to the rectory of Tunstall, near Casterton, which he resigned in 1828. In 1818 he was appointed chaplain to the duke of Sussex, in 1825 his father presented him to the rectory of Whittington, Lancashire, and from 1834 to 1856 he was perpetual curate of Casterton. He succeeded his father to the Casterton estates in 1851.<br>
<br>Carus Wilson acquired his reputation as &#145;Father of the cheap religious literature of the day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>) by his prolific writings for and editorship of penny periodicals over a period of more than twenty-five years. He aimed to inculcate religious belief and habits by retelling admonitory and morality tales in plain and simple language accessible to the semi-literate. The emphasis on sin, hell-fire punishment, and especially death, often described at length in harrowing detail, now seems morbid and distasteful, especially as most of the literature was aimed at children, but the tracts attained a wide circulation and influence; by 1845, 3000 copies each of the <span class="italic">Friendly Visitor</span> (established 1819), the <span class="italic">Children's Friend</span> (1824), and the <span class="italic">Teacher's Friend</span> (1844) were distributed monthly.<br>
<br>Carus Wilson was also an energetic founder of charity schools for girls, including the School for Training Servants and Teachers at Whittington (1820) and the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge, Lancashire (1824). The latter became notorious as the original of Lowood Institution in <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span> (1847). Charlotte Bront&euml; entered the school in 1824 with her sisters, Maria, Elizabeth, and Emily; the two eldest girls developed tuberculosis there and were sent home to die. Charlotte Bront&euml; always blamed the school's harsh regime and punitive religious discipline for their early deaths, and in her novel graphically portrayed the pupils' sufferings. Many former pupils recognized the school and its founder (Mr Brocklehurst), though Bront&euml; always maintained that she had not felt it necessary to be impartial or objective in a work of fiction, and another former pupil, Emma Jane Worboise, who was at the school in the 1840s, remembered Carus Wilson as kind, sincere, and generous. When Mrs Gaskell identified the school and Carus Wilson by name in her <span class="italic">Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</span> (1857) she was threatened with a libel action. The school's problems had been mainly confined to its early years and most of these were remedied by its removal in 1833 to a new site at Casterton, where it flourished.<br>
<br>By 1845 ill health, especially sciatica, forced Carus Wilson to delegate some of his responsibilities. He ceased active editorship of his periodicals, resigned the management of his schools to his son and sons-in-law, and spent three years on the continent, wintering at Nice&#151;where he tried to evangelize Sardinian soldiers. He then retired to Ventnor, Isle of Wight, where from 1855 he resided at Eglinton House. He took an active interest in the welfare of soldiers and sailors. During the Indian mutiny he distributed 1,500,000 <span class="roman">Bibles</span> and tracts to British soldiers, maintained a monthly correspondence with more than 200 of them, and established a soldiers' institute at Portsmouth, where he campaigned for temperance and reportedly caused a local brewer to retire from his business.<br>
<br>Carus Wilson's wife died, aged seventy-three at Eglinton House on 15 November 1859. Declaring himself &#145;a poor sinner creeping into Heaven&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>), he died of abdominal cancer at 20 Montague Place, Russell Square, Bloomsbury, on 30 December 1859, and was buried in the family vault at Casterton on 7 January 1860. In St John's Church, Newport, Isle of Wight, a monument was &#145;erected by the non-commissioned officers and privates of the British Army in token of their love and gratitude&#146;  (Ewbank, 22).<br>
