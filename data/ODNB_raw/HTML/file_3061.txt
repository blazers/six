<span class="headword">Bowes, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1389&#150;1465), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of Sir Robert Bowes (<i>d</i>. in or before 1410), of Streatlam, co. Durham, and was said to be of full age in 1410. John Leland, writing about 1540, recorded what had by then seemingly become established in family lore: that Bowes served in France for seventeen years under John, duke of Bedford, whose chamberlain he became, and grew so rich that on his return he was able to rebuild his manor house at Streatlam. Further tradition asserts that it was the loss of his wife, Jane, daughter of Ralph, Lord Greystoke, in the first year of his marriage, that prompted him to serve in the wars, and that he was captain of Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard in Normandy. Evidence in support of these particulars is scant. In 1413 the name of Bowes's wife was recorded as Elizabeth, and there is no known record of his having either been captain of Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard or associated with Bedford. Following the latter's death in 1435, Bowes's name was not included in the list of the duke's commanders and retainers in France. The issue is further confused by the existence of others of the same or very similar name, including Sir William's own son.<br>
<br>Bowes is not listed in the roll of arms of those present at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. He may have been identical with the William Bowes who mustered in the retinue of the earl of Northumberland, to accompany the latter to France in 1417. And by March 1418 he was certainly in France, acting on behalf of the duke of Clarence at the surrender of the castle of Courtonne, and in September was empowered to receive all brigands and others wishing to perform homage to Henry V in Normandy; he was probably knighted in that year. He joined the spring campaign of 1420 as a captain, departing from Southampton and arriving at Harfleur in May. There is some evidence that Bowes did profit from his part in the wars. Although he was himself a prisoner in France in November 1422, in the following March his prisoner Philippe de Monstreuil was given a safe conduct to travel to France, presumably to arrange for a ransom. And in 1427 a like safe conduct was issued for another prisoner, Thomas Syras, enabling him to go to Scotland, there to raise his ransom due to Bowes.<br>
<br>By the mid-1420s Bowes was back in England, where he played a minor part in the affairs of the north. On 5 April 1424 he and two other commissioners received at Melrose the oath of James I, king of Scots, to observe the conditions of his recent release from English captivity. In 1426 he was licensed to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and may well have completed the journey, as he was certainly abroad in June of that year. In 1434 he was reportedly at odds with the vicar of Gainford, a few miles east of Streatlam; this did not prevent Bishop Langley's appointing him sheriff of Durham in 1436. From this point it becomes impossible to be certain whether all references to William Bowes are to him, or to his son, or to others of the same name. A William Bowes mustered in the retinue of Henry Bourchier, count of Eu, in March 1441, and in 1448 either the same man or a namesake received protection, as he was going to France in the company of Sir Richard Vernon. The Sir William Bowes who fought at Ludford Bridge in 1459, who held Alnwick for Edward IV in 1461, and who received a border commission in 1464, may have been the son of the warrior of forty years earlier. But it was presumably the father whose inquisition post mortem records him as having died before 11 October 1465.<br>
