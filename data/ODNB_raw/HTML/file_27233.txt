<span class="headword">Thomas <span class="st"> [Evans]</span>,  Lewis</span>  (1568?&#150;1619?), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was probably born in Glamorgan, although he may have been born in Radnor. He matriculated, as Lewis Evans, at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, on 11 December 1584, and graduated BA as Lewis Evans alias Thomas from Brasenose College on 15 February 1587. Shortly afterwards he was ordained and received a benefice &#145;in his native county of Glamorgan and elsewhere&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>).<br>
<br>During his ministry Thomas wrote two volumes of sermons. The first, <span class="italic">Seaven sermons, or, The exercises of seven sabbaoths; together with a short treatise upon the commaundements</span> (1599), dedicated to Richard Broughton, an assize judge for north Wales, expounded a variety of texts from the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, and proved very popular, appearing in ten further editions up to 1630. In the first two sermons he attacked the vanity and corruption of the period and asserted the need for repentance. Thomas also recalled the &#145;generall plague&#146; and &#145;famine&#146; which had devastated the land, in that &#145;time of sorrow and perplexity&#146; when friends and neighbours kept their distance and &#145;they who this day carried the dead bodies to their graves, were themselves on the morrow carried by others into their graves&#146;  (L. Thomas, <span class="italic">Seaven Sermons</span>, 1599, 21&#150;2). Later sermons attacked transubstantiation as &#145;a grosse and most absurb opinion, that we should rent with our teeth the very flesh of Christ our Saviour. This is even to crucifie Christ againe like the Jews&#146;  (ibid., 33) and claimed that the pope offered &#145;counterfaite phisicke to purge mens soules and to cleane their sins by his bulls, pardons and indulgences, and such trumpery&#146;  (ibid., 69). &#145;The forming of Eve&#146; spoke of women's duty to help their husbands through hard work, but also presented an ideal of reciprocal responsibility and a mutually supportive, companionate relationship, where &#145;No bitter wordes must passe betweene them, much less blowes&#146;  (ibid., 91&#150;2).<br>
<br>Thomas's <span class="italic">Demegoriai: Certaine Lectures upon Sundry Portions of Scripture</span> (1600), consisting of eight sermons, again on diverse biblical passages, and dedicated to his first patron, Sir Thomas Egerton, lord keeper of the great seal, expressed conventional Christian values and offered sage advice to magistrates and his parishioners. The former were to &#145;circumspectly looke into the disorders there&#146; and to avoid corruption which, he noted, was the fashion &#145;of many magistrates that carry no conscience&#146;  (L. Thomas, <span class="italic">Demegoriai</span>, 1600, &#145;Christ travailing unto Jerusalem&#146;). He recommended that they ought to examine all crimes, large and small, and punish accordingly. Thus their &#145;judiciall censures must not be like Spyders webs, which intangle onely the small flies &hellip; [they] ought to be Eagle-sighted, the better to looke into abuses &hellip; into every corner of corruption, that no sinne may escape without his censure&#146;  (ibid.). They were to be like &#145;Gods&#146; to ensure that &#145;no weake, or corrupt, or blinde Magistrate be preferred: but the wisest and best approved&#146;  (ibid.). In &#145;The history of the Lord's birth&#146; Lewis observed further that good housekeeping and hospitality were in danger of becoming &#145;lost through pride and prodigalitie&#146; while in &#145;The anatomy of tale-bearers&#146; he called on the gentry to remember the poor. All sections of the community were similarly warned about tale-bearing for gossips were &#145;worse than crowes: for they feed but upon dead carkasses but these carriers of tales feede upon them that are alive&#146;. It is believed that Thomas died in 1619 in Glamorgan, but the exact date and whereabouts of his death and burial are unknown.<br>
