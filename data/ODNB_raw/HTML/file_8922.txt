<span class="headword">Etheridge <span class="st"> [Etherege]</span>,  George</span>  (1519&#150;1588?), <span class="occ">physician and classical scholar</span>, was born in Thame, Oxfordshire. Presumably educated at Thame Abbey before going to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he was admitted as a scholar there on 11 November 1534 aged fifteen years and one month. A pupil of John Shepreve, Etheridge graduated BA on 15 February 1539 and was elected a probationary fellow six days later. Made a full fellow on 26 February 1541, he graduated MA on 20 June 1543 and was appointed a college lecturer in Greek the same year. On taking his BM degree in autumn 1545 Etheridge resigned his college positions to take his &#145;place among the physicians&#146;  (Etheridge, <span class="italic">In libros Pauli Aeginetae</span>, sig. A4<i>v</i>). Two years later, in January 1547, he was appointed regius professor in Greek.<br>
<br>At Christ Church, Etheridge was one of the few lecturers not to take pupils. As a classicist he was widely esteemed for his linguistic precision, his gift of poetry, and his skill as a translator. Pits knew of his translation of the works of Justin Martyr into Latin, as well as of an abridged version of the psalter, in Hebrew, neither of which survive. As a medical doctor he was similarly valued by his colleagues who, according to Etheridge's own testimony, showed respect for his double vocation: &#145;The great physicians &hellip; showed me much kindness&#146; when teaching Greek in the university  (Etheridge, <span class="italic">In libros Pauli Aeginetae</span>, sig. A4<i>v</i>). He was among the few Oxford physicians to publish a textbook of medicine and pharmacology, <span class="italic">In libros Pauli Aeginetae</span>. Written specifically for the training of medical students, together with the works of Edward Wotton and Matthew Gwynn it formed &#145;the sum total of known works in Latin of all the Oxford medical graduates of the century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 3: <span class="italic">Colleg. univ.</span>, 242).<br>
<br>While Etheridge showed some initial support for the royal supremacy in 1538 when he was among a group of fellows censoring the continued appeal to papal supremacy in Corpus Christi College, like many Catholics he had to vacate his chair in 1550 following a royal visitation to the university. Reinstated within a month of Mary's accession, he was present at the trial of Latimer and Ridley in 1555 where he demanded that Ridley should be gagged at his degradation from the priesthood. &#145;A forward person against the Protestants in Queen Mary's reign&#146;, in April 1559 Etheridge was deprived of his lectureship almost immediately after his refusal to take the oath of supremacy following the accession of Elizabeth I  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.546f.). Following his dismissal from office, Etheridge moved from his quarters in Christ Church to William Hall in Kibald Street, which he had rented from the university. There he practised to great acclaim as a medical doctor, provided &#145;a refuge for poor scholars, granted hospitality to clergy, and his lavish liberality provided for all necessities of the Catholics&#146;  (Pits, 785). Wood reports that he counted <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10668/', "William Gifford")</script>, later Catholic archbishop of Rheims, among his students at William Hall &#145;who received from him the rudiments in grammar, music and partly in logic&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.547).<br>
<br>As a &#145;confessor of the orthodox faith&#146;  (Pits, 784), Etheridge was purportedly interrogated and imprisoned frequently, both in Oxford and London. While his opposition to Elizabethan claims to sovereignty was well established, in 1566 he none the less dedicated a Greek ode to the queen on the occasion of her visit to the university, in which he reminded her of the achievements and the faith of Henry VIII. Etheridge probably died in 1588.<br>
