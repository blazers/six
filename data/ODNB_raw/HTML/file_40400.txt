<span class="headword">Simpson,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Flint Jack]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1815&#150;<em>c.</em>1880), <span class="occ">archaeological forger and craftsman</span>, was possibly born in the Whitby region of Yorkshire, but nothing is known for certain about his parentage or early life. He went by a variety of aliases, the best known of which was &#145;Flint Jack&#146;. He also used the name John Wilson. Other nicknames included &#145;Bones&#146;, &#145;the Old Antiquarian&#146;, &#145;Fossil Willy&#146;, &#145;Cockney Bill&#146;, and &#145;Shirtless&#146;.<br>
<br>Simpson's activities began to be noticed in 1853, when Charles Roach Smith wrote to warn Thomas Bateman of forgers at Whitby. In 1855 and 1857 Bateman received further letters complaining about forgers in the town called John Wilson, alias &#145;Bones&#146;, and Jerry Taylor. These two, particularly &#145;Bones&#146;, sold forgeries of prehistoric flint tools, pottery vessels, and jet seals. During this period Edward Tindall, an antiquary and collector of Bridlington, Yorkshire, formed an archaeological collection which attracted some interest. But when Tindall exhibited this in York at the Yorkshire Museum in 1857 many items were condemned as the product of the forger known as &#145;Bones&#146;, &#145;Flint Jack&#146;, or &#145;Shirtless&#146;.<br>
<br>Awareness of his activities caused Simpson to leave Yorkshire and roam Britain selling forgeries (his identification with John Wilson, alias &#145;Bones&#146;, is confirmed by works which mention his early association with Jerry Taylor). In 1857 a collector at Blackheath, Surrey, purchased forged archaeological items; twelve years later he saw a photograph of Simpson, whom he identified as the vendor.<br>
<br>Simpson became well known to archaeologists, who called him &#145;Flint Jack&#146;, seldom using any proper name. In 1862 he demonstrated flint-knapping techniques for the Geologists' Association. The following year he visited Salisbury, where he manufactured flint tools for the museum and was photographed at work. He returned to Yorkshire in August 1863 and received a month's imprisonment for petty theft at Bridlington.<br>
<br>In 1866 Simpson was the subject of a long article in the <span class="italic">Malton Messenger</span>, the newspaper of Malton in Yorkshire, which claimed to use information supplied by the forger himself. Afterwards published in pamphlet form, this has served as the basis of later biographies, but there are difficulties with its chronology. The article claimed that Simpson began making flint tools in 1843 and first left Yorkshire in 1846. This is at variance with his documented activities by ten years. His visit to Salisbury Museum is dated to 1854, but the museum was not founded until 1860.<br>
<br>James Wyatt, a Bedford journalist, described a visit from &#145;Flint Jack&#146; in his diary in 1867. Shortly afterwards Simpson was arrested for theft and sentenced to a year's imprisonment in Bedford gaol. While he was in prison a financial appeal on his behalf appeared in <span class="italic">The Reliquary</span>. In 1872 Simpson formed a surprising partnership with Alfred Elliot, a retired policeman, at Stamford. Elliot took Simpson's photograph, which allegedly sold many copies.<br>
<br>Simpson's fame rests on his career as a manufacturer of flint tools. Sometimes he passed these illicitly, at other times he openly made them as replicas. His itinerant life presumably prevented marriage or acquisition of wealth. Those who met Simpson, alias &#145;Flint Jack&#146;, commented on his untidy appearance, and photographs show him badly shaven and wearing torn clothes. Sometimes appearing unintelligent, and clearly lacking formal education, he displayed knowledge of and enthusiasm for prehistoric archaeology. During his wanderings he looked for genuine flint tools, which he sold or even gave to those who appreciated them.<br>
<br>There is no record of his activities after 1878. It is believed that he died in poverty in a Yorkshire workhouse at about this time. Items made by &#145;Flint Jack&#146; remain in the museums at Whitby, Hull, Salisbury, and Bedford. The Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh possesses tools used by him.<br>
