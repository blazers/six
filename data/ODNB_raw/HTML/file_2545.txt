<span class="headword">Blackwood,  Adam</span>  (1539&#150;1613), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and Roman Catholic polemicist</span>, was born in Dunfermline, Fife, one of at least three children of William Blackwood (<i>d</i>. 1547), soldier, and Helen Reid (<i>d</i>. 1547/8). His parents died when he was about eight years old, his father in battle at Pinkie, and his mother shortly afterwards. After their deaths he came into the care of his maternal great-uncle, Robert Reid, bishop of Orkney, who <i>c</i>.1552 sent him to be educated in Paris. At the university there he was taught by Adrian Turn&egrave;be (Turnebus), a well-known literary figure of the day, and Jean Dorat (Auratus), a poet in Latin and Greek, who inspired Blackwood to follow his example. When his great-uncle died in 1558 after negotiating the marriage between Mary, queen of Scots, and the Dauphin Fran&ccedil;ois, Blackwood returned to Scotland. However, the political and religious circumstances proved unwelcoming for a committed Roman Catholic, and he returned quickly to Paris. There, through the support of Mary, he continued his studies, including philosophy. From about 1560 he also spent two years at the University of Toulouse studying civil law, which became the foundation of his later career.<br>
<br>Once his studies were complete Blackwood taught philosophy at Paris, where he was rector in 1567&#150;8. He caught the attention of James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow and the Scottish ambassador, with his early works, firstly <span class="italic">Caroli IX pompa funebris versiculis expressa per A. B. J. C. (juris consultum)</span>, a memorial poem for Charles IX (Paris, 1574), and secondly and more importantly, <span class="italic">De vinculo religionis et imperii libri duo</span> (&#145;Of the chains of religion and government, in two books&#146;; Paris, 1575). <span class="italic">De vinculo</span> argued for the legitimacy of state-imposed faith, specifically Roman Catholic, and for state extirpation of heresy. Impressed by Blackwood's arguments, Beaton recommended that Mary appoint him counsellor to the parliament of Poitiers in Poitou, a preferment that she held in her gift as part of her marriage settlement. After Henri III had granted confirmation of his position, Blackwood settled in Poitiers, where <i>c</i>.1580 he married Maria Courtinier (<i>fl</i>. 1575&#150;1613), the daughter of the king's treasurer there. They had eleven children, four sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>In Poitiers Blackwood continued his writing career, and remained interested in Scottish affairs. <span class="italic">Adversus Georgii Buchanani dialogum de jure regni apud Scotos pro regibus apologia</span> (&#145;Apology for kings against George Buchanan's dialogue on the law of government among the Scots&#146;; Poitiers, 1581; Paris, 1588) challenges Buchanan's arguments for the right of subjects to depose unsatisfactory monarchs, on the grounds that a king is set apart once anointed, and can be subject to none but divine judgment. It also repeats a theme of <span class="italic">De vinculo</span>, connecting heretical belief with political sedition. Blackwood's attack on Buchanan was also rooted in his loyalty to Mary, queen of Scots, whom he is said to have visited in her captivity in England. As well as translating one of her poems into Latin, after her execution he produced <span class="italic">Martyre de la royne d'&Eacute;cosse</span>, which described her treatment at the hands of Elizabeth, and included transcriptions of the correspondence, as well as poems attacking Elizabeth at the end of the volume. This was first published in 1587, shortly after the queen's execution; the printer's mark says it was printed by Jean Nafield in Edinburgh, whereas it was in fact printed in Paris, and reprinted in Antwerp in 1588 and 1589. The work, of which there is a nearly contemporary translation into Scots (printed by the Maitland Club in 1834), is evidently partisan, and demonstrates the loyalty Mary aroused in her followers.<br>
<br>After Mary's execution Blackwood did not go to England until 1604, when he visited James VI and I in London. By that point Blackwood's writing was largely confined to religious and poetic material. He wrote a series of spiritual meditations, <span class="italic">Sanctarum precationum proemia</span> (Poitiers, 1598, 1608), and was the author of a penitential study of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, <span class="italic">In psalmum Davidis quinquagesimum</span> (Poitiers, 1608), and a collection of poems, <span class="italic">Varii generis poemata</span> (Poitiers, 1609), in which appeared his translation of Mary's poem. In 1606 he returned to political writing, when he published his <span class="italic">Inauguratio Jacobi Magnae Britanniae regis</span>, and in 1612 he added an extra book to <span class="italic">De vinculo</span> and dedicated it to Henry, prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Blackwood died in 1613, in Poitiers, and was buried in St Porcharius's Church in the town. His contribution to the development of the theory of absolute monarchy can be seen as part of a Scottish Catholic rejection of Buchanan's interpretation of Scottish history, and in his foreshadowing of the &#145;divine right of kings&#146; an influence on events to come. His contemporary importance in this respect is shown by Gabriel Naud&eacute;'s publication of his complete works in French and Latin in Paris in 1644, together with a eulogy and an engraving by Picart.<br>
