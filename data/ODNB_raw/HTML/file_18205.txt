</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  Richard</span>  (1533/4&#150;1617), <span class="occ">goldsmith</span>, whose early life is obscure, was sworn free of the Goldsmiths' Company of London in 1555. He subsequently took no fewer than forty apprentices and served four times as prime warden of the company. His standing as one of the most important goldsmiths of his day is further evidenced by his appointment both to the office of warden of the mint, and as a supplier to Queen Elizabeth I, to whom, he claimed in 1593, he was accustomed to purvey annually &#145;above &pound;1000 worth of plate and chains of gold &hellip; and sometimes thrice so much&#146;  (Collier, 181).<br>
<br>The occasion of Martin's going to the mint, which was in 1572, and not, as has commonly been stated, in 1559&#150;60, was the reorganization of the administration there, consequent upon the demise of his fellow goldsmith Thomas Stanley. The system of direct management, which had operated since the start of the open debasement of the coinage in 1544, was replaced by the more traditional arrangements, whereby the master worker took responsibility for the production of coins at the correct weight and standard, and a number of royal officials, of whom the warden was the most senior, provided a control mechanism. It was the warden who formally accounted to the crown for production, and it was to the wardenship that Martin was appointed. The master worker, with whom he should have been able to deal harmoniously, was another goldsmith, John Lonyson, but, in the event, their relationship was marked only by discord.<br>
<br>The point at issue was the exploitation of the remedy, or working tolerance, which allowed coin marginally deficient in weight or fineness nevertheless to pass current. Traditionally, far from being seen as a device to facilitate the manufacture of substandard coin, the remedy had been regarded simply as a safeguard to protect the master worker, in case, by sheer chance, his coins proved to be deficient. To Martin all this was perfectly clear, whereas to Lonyson it certainly was not. As it happened, Lonyson's indenture had not been as tightly drawn as it should have been, and thus, to him, so long as his coins were passed standard at the trial of the pyx, not only had he fulfilled his legal obligation, but he might pocket as profit all that arose from his coins' falling short of the prescribed standards, while still remaining within the remedies. When a detailed government inquiry found that technically Lonyson was correct, order was only restored by his being given higher coining allowances, which were to be paid for by officially reducing both the fineness and weight of all gold and silver coins made. Lonyson had won; but so too had Martin for, in addition to Lonyson's now being controlled in the extent to which he might benefit from the coinage above the levels set in his indenture, from September 1578 Lonyson was permitted to coin only by a series of short-term commissions, issued jointly to Martin and himself. In 1582 Martin completed his triumph when, on Lonyson's death, he himself secured the office of master worker.<br>
<br>Despite the absurdity of a situation in which Martin in one capacity was allowed to be the official check on what he did in another, Martin continued to hold both his offices until 1599, and during that time was instrumental in stilling one of the most important debates the mint has ever known: namely, how the sterling standard was to be defined. Both Martin and his opponent, Thomas Keeling, assay master at Goldsmiths' Hall, were agreed that sterling was 11 ounces 2 pennyweight fine and that, when tested by fire assay, approximately 2 dwt (pennyweight) of silver, would drain away with the impurities into the cupel, giving a result which implied that silver was 2 dwt less than it actually was. What they were not agreed upon, however, was the figure from which the 2 dwt should be deducted: was it, as Martin said, from 11 oz 2 dwt of fine silver put in at the melting, and which would give an assay result of around 11 oz, or was it, as Keeling claimed, from 11 oz 4 dwt of fine silver which would result after the assay in a standard of 11 oz 2 dwt? Between 1583 and 1586 the debate, through words and practical demonstration, was intense, but in the end it was Martin's view that prevailed.<br>
<br>In addition to trading as a goldsmith, and holding office at the mint, Martin owned a salt works, and became in 1568 a founder member of the Society of Mineral and Battery Works, from which he obtained leases on the wire works at Tintern, as well as, for a time, on the battery works themselves. It is said that in 1596 he owned, with two of his sons, Nathaniel and Richard, over one-third of all the paid-up shares in the society, of which two years previously he had become, with his son-in-law, Sir Julius Caesar, joint governor. Martin also had an interest in overseas trade, being mentioned in the charters of the Levant Company, as well as appearing as a founder member of the Turkey Company, and being three (possibly four) times governor of the Russia Company. The surviving portion of a double-entry journal for 1581 not only dispels doubts which have been expressed as to whether he actually did trade in merchandise, but shows clearly that he was also a moneylender.<br>
<br>An alderman from 1578, sheriff in 1581, and lord mayor in 1589 (the year in which he was knighted) and 1594, Martin was, at the height of his influence, possibly the most active of all London's senior aldermen, not least through his being comptroller-general of hospitals from 1594 to 1602. In the latter year, however, he was declared bankrupt, and degraded from the aldermanry. Temporarily imprisoned, he was forced to sell for &pound;10,200 his principal residence in Tottenham, his great messuage in Milk Street in the City of London, together with other property and leases in town and country. Martin found his position all the harder to bear because of yet another serious dispute at the mint, this time with Sir Thomas Knyvet, to whom he had relinquished the wardenship in 1599. In the course of a spirited defence designed to show, but in the end failing to substantiate, that he did not, as Knyvet alleged, owe the crown &pound;8382, Martin produced a significant treatise on assaying which he dedicated to James I in 1603/4.<br>
<br>Martin's first wife, whom he married before 1562, was Dorcas Ecclestone (1536/7&#150;1599) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46911/', "Martin, Dorcas")</script>], daughter of Sir John Ecclestone of Lancashire. A second marriage took place before 1616, when the younger Richard Martin bequeathed to his father and his lady &pound;3 each for a ring; and it was this Lady Martin, Elizabeth, formerly Bourne (<i>d</i>. 1627), sister of John Cottesford, goldsmith of London, who was able on Sir Richard's death successfully to claim payments in respect of his mint office. By the first marriage there were five sons and one daughter, Dorcas, who took as her second husband Sir Julius Caesar, master of the rolls. Two of the sons, Nathaniel and Richard, were associated with Martin at the mint, where Nathaniel was clerk from 1589 to 1594 and Richard was deputy master worker from 1588 to 1598 and then joint master worker from 1598 to 1607. Another son, Captain John Martin (<i>d</i>. 1632), was a member of the council of Jamestown, Virginia. Sir Richard Martin died in July 1617, and was buried in Tottenham, where his first wife, Dorcas, had been interred in 1599.<br>
