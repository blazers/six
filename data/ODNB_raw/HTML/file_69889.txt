<span class="headword">Feinman,  Sigmund</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Asher-Zelig Feinman]</span>  (1862&#150;1909), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born Asher-Zelig Feinman on 28 April 1862 in Intshest, Ukraine. Since both his grandfathers had prominent roles in the synagogue, it was natural for Feinman to receive a traditional religious education. His father, however, was a manufacturer, and thus receptive to influences from beyond the Jewish sphere, so he sent his son to secular schools as well.<br>
<br>Young Asher-Zelig's beautiful singing voice earned him a place in his synagogue choir, a position that would have given him a rigorous musical education. When a theatre company led by Naftule Goldfaden (brother of the Yiddish playwright and theatre manager Avrom Goldfaden) came to perform in the nearby city of Kishinyov, Feinman was drawn to it like a moth to flame, and joined the chorus. His rapid advance to leading roles made the theatrical life too tempting; he left home and joined the company in earnest.<br>
<br>After tsarist authorities imposed a ban on the Yiddish theatre in 1883, Feinman headed for Romania, where his linguistic talents served him well, and he led several different companies there. Like many of his colleagues, he eventually made his way further westward&#151;first to London, and then in 1886 to New York, where he joined a company led by Sigmund Mogulesco and Moyshe Finkel. Feinman's fame continued to grow in America, where he ultimately came to be seen as a rival to leading men like Jacob Adler, David Kessler, and Boris Thomashefsky. All three towered over much of their competition in more ways than one: in physical stature, vocal strength, intelligence, and charisma.<br>
<br>Feinman had another thing in common with Adler: after Adler divorced the actress Dina Stettin in 1891, Feinman married her, and she became famous under her new married name. Feinman adopted her daughter Celia, from her marriage with Adler; however, despite Celia's great fondness for her stepfather, she retained her natural father's name, and became internationally renowned on the stage as Celia Adler. Feinman had two children from a previous marriage (details of which are unknown): a son, Joe, and a daughter, Lily. Lily became an actress, and married the prominent comedian Ludwig Satz. With Dina, Feinman had another daughter, Becky.<br>
<br>In 1892 Feinman became a manager of Poole's Theatre in lower Manhattan, New York, along with Adler, Mogulesco, and Kessler. Like many a similar venture throughout the history of the Yiddish theatre, however, this seems to have put too many large egos under one roof, and the partnership did not last. Feinman left New York altogether for a while, choosing instead to tour what American Yiddish actors called the <i>provints</i>; in typically Manhattanocentric style, this referred to any venue outside the city of New York. Feinman spent several years touring smaller cities in the United States and Canada before returning to New York in the mid-1890s.<br>
<br>The last decade or so of Feinman's career was peripatetic, with an itinerary ranging from Europe to North and South America. He spent long periods at the Pavilion Theatre in London and Gimpel's Theatre in Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w), as well as enjoying successful engagements in Buenos Aires, and in Bucharest and many other European cities.<br>
<br>Throughout much of his career Feinman was also active as a playwright. Among his dozen or so plays and operettas, the most successful were <span class="italic">Azarye der Giber Hakhayil, oder, Der Printsesins Neyder</span> (&#145;Azariah the War Hero, or, The Princess's Oath&#146;, 1896), <span class="italic">Der Vitse-Kenig</span> (&#145;The Viceroy&#146;, 1898), <span class="italic">Khanele di finisherin</span> (&#145;Hannah the Seamstress&#146;, 1899), and <span class="italic">Der yid in Sobyeskis tsaytn, oder, Shabes koydesh</span> (&#145;The Jew in Sobieski's era, or, The holy sabbath&#146;, 1904). All of these enjoyed popular success in America as well as Europe.<br>
<br>In grand theatrical style, Feinman spent his final moments on stage. The portly and ailing actor, defying doctors' orders, embarked on a tour to &#321;&oacute;d&#378; in spring 1909. During a rehearsal of Karl Gutzkow's <span class="italic">Uriel Acosta</span>, long a staple of the Yiddish repertory, Feinman collapsed on stage on 1 July 1909, and died shortly thereafter. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery in &#321;&oacute;d&#378; the following day.<br>
<br>Feinman's career has not been chronicled in nearly as much detail as those of many of his contemporaries in the Yiddish theatre, which is perhaps how he would have wanted it. Rather than make a permanent base in New York, he split his time with venues in Europe and elsewhere, where the spotlight was somewhat dimmer in his day (and the streets less cluttered with theatre historians). And unlike other stars like Adler, Bertha Kalish, Thomashefsky, or his stepdaughter, Celia Adler, Feinman never published his memoirs. He did, however, gain the admiration and love of his audiences and the critics, and his career deserves closer scrutiny.<br>
