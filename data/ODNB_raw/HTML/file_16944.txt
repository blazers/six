</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Logan, Sir  William Edmond</span>  (1798&#150;1875), <span class="occ">geologist in Canada</span>, was born on 20 April 1798 in Montreal, the second son in the family of nine children of William Logan (1759&#150;1841), a baker and owner of real estate, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edmond (<i>d</i>. 1836). His grandfather was James Logan, a baker from Stirling who emigrated to Canada in 1784. Logan was educated at Alexander Skakel's school in Montreal and, from 1814 to 1816, at the Revd James Lippan's school in Edinburgh, where he was top of his class of 200. For one year he attended Edinburgh University, where he was registered in medicine, with classes in logic, mathematics, and chemistry; the last taught by Professor T. C. Hope, an opponent of James Hutton and Plutonism. In 1817 Logan moved to London, where he worked in accounting for his uncle. His evenings were spent studying geometry and languages, playing the flute, and painting, but he did not relish the evening social events which he attended with his uncle.<br>
<br>In 1831 Logan's uncle acquired an interest in the Forest Copper Works near Swansea and Logan was appointed to manage the accounts. However, he soon realized that a continuous supply of coal was essential to the works, and that reserves could only be determined from a precisely surveyed geological map. He set out to survey the area, plotting his findings on the available existing maps. At one point he wrote to his brother in London noting that &#145;if a pound or two  would make the theodolite better, I should be disposed to give it.&#146; Nevertheless, when his map was displayed in Liverpool at the 1837 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Henry De la Beche, director of the geological survey, adopted it as the official map; Logan's name remains on the modern maps of the area. As a result of his work, in 1837 he was elected to the Geological Society of London.<br>
<br>Between February and April 1829 Logan travelled in Italy, possibly as a tourist. His diary contains notes about building stones, including granite, porphyry, travertine, and alabaster&#151;indicating his knowledge, and possibly the nature of his uncle's business. In 1834 a business trip of several months was made to Spain, including Cadiz and Barcelona, possibly to visit copper mines. On this trip he was reading Charles Lyell's <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span>, published in 1830, and probably made a number of watercolour paintings.<br>
<br>Although he continued map making in south Wales until 1841, Logan had been without permanent employment since the death of his uncle in 1838. In late 1841 he applied for the position of founding director of the geological survey of Canada. William Buckland, Adam Sedgwick, Roderick Murchison, and Henry De la Beche all supported his application and he was offered the appointment, with headquarters in Montreal, and accepted on 14 April 1842. Within seven years, with four employees and field guides drawn from among the local people, he determined the general geology of the area which bordered the St Lawrence River and ran northwards from the Great Lakes shores. His first objective was to find coal. In May 1843 he measured a 14,570 foot section of sediments with coal at Joggins, Nova Scotia, but at that time Nova Scotia was not part of Canada. Further surveys, in 1843 and 1844, of the Gasp&eacute; coastline and a transect of the interior failed to reveal any coal deposits. Alexander Murray, Logan's able mapper in the field, confirmed the absence of coal in Upper Canada. As a result, in subsequent years Logan's objective was mineral deposits. He personally mapped along the Ottawa River, and the area east of Montreal where copper showings were found.<br>
<br>Using surveying instruments for field mapping proved impractical for Canada's vast area, much of it rugged wilderness. Logan perfected the &#145;pace and compass&#146; method&#151;counting paces along a line established by prismatic compass&#151;which showed errors in the geographic maps made by earlier surveyors. While he was mapping the Gasp&eacute; coast local farmers and fishermen became concerned about this strange fellow walking in a seemingly erratic manner, mumbling to himself, cracking rocks with a large hammer, wrapping rock chips in paper, pencilling notes in a leather-bound book, and sleeping on the beach under a blanket hung over some sticks. On two occasions attempts were made to take him to an insane asylum, but his courteous manner, fluent French, and lucid explanations of the activity allayed fears.<br>
<br>Logan published thirteen annual reports, issued from 1845 to 1857; four copies had to be provided for the government, which he personally wrote with ink and paper. His workday in the office, and in the field, began two hours before breakfast. He seldom if ever had any lunch, and the lamp in his office was seen burning until midnight and beyond. Some wondered if he ever slept. In 1854 the government conducted an official inquiry on the value of the geological survey and Logan called prominent geologists from the United States and Britain to testify. As a result, the government doubled the survey budget. However, when government funds still proved inadequate, Logan used his own money to keep the survey going, spending C$10,000 by 1864. His major summary report, <span class="italic">Geology of Canada</span> (1863), contained 498 woodcuts, mostly of fossils and field sketches. A small atlas followed in 1865&#151;it included a colour lithographed map covering parts of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, northern United States, and Manitoba. In 1869 a 4 foot by 6 foot map was published, with individual copies hand coloured, possibly by Logan himself. It is not surprising that he suffered from eye strain.<br>
<br>In 1851 substantial collections of Canadian rocks and minerals were displayed at the Great Exhibition in London, and Logan was elected to the Royal Society; after a similar exhibition in Paris in 1855, Emperor Napoleon III of France appointed him to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was knighted on 29 January 1856, the first native-born Canadian to be so honoured. On his return to Canada, Toronto citizens organized a banquet; the Royal Canadian Institute commissioned his oil portrait by George Berthon; and Montreal citizens held a soir&eacute;e and commissioned a &#145;silver fountain&#146;. In a letter to his brother, Logan implied that if the price of fame was speaking in public, he would gladly forgo the fame. Among his many other awards were the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London (1856); royal medal of the Royal Society (1867); the degrees of doctor of civil laws of Bishop's University, Lennoxville, Quebec (1855), and doctor of laws of McGill University, Montreal (1856); and induction into the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame, in January 1992. Logan endowed the chair of geology at McGill.<br>
<br>Logan's chief contributions to geology included the first precise geological maps using surveying instruments, the realization that the underclay of coal beds with <i>Stigmaria</i> roots is evidence for the <i>in situ</i> origin of coal; and the establishment of the policies, philosophical objectives, and methodology of operation, of the geological survey of Canada, aims and methods which still prevailed in the late twentieth century.<br>
<br>About 5 feet 8 inches in height, with a muscular build, Logan had great stamina. In the spring of 1827 he and two brothers, together with a friend, travelled about 350 miles in ten days, from their father's estate, Clarkstone (now called Avondale), near Polmont, Scotland, by walking, carriage, rowing boat, farm wagon, and steam boat. In one day, they walked from Ballachulish to Fort William and to the top of Ben Nevis. Walking the Canadian wilderness was made more difficult by dense bush, clouds of biting insects, rain, and snow. B. J. Harrington, Logan's biographer (1883), described him as &#145;strong in body, of active mind, industrious and doggedly persevering, painstaking, a lover of truth, generous, possessed of the keenest knowledge of human nature, sound in judgment, but always cautious about expressing an opinion&#146;  (Harrington).<br>
<br>The Logan family were Presbyterians; William still attended church while living in London, but after his move to Wales in 1831 he worked seven days a week from before dawn to late evening, in office and field. In 1870 the Logan family donated a bell for the twin towered Presbyterian church in Polmont, in memory of their father. Logan retired as survey director on 30 November 1869 but continued fieldwork in the folded rocks east of Montreal where copper was being mined. He owned rental property in Montreal, probably inherited from his father and elder brother, James; some thought he might have been the richest man in Canada, and he was reputed to have left over &pound;400,000 in cash, as well as extensive property. He died on 22 June 1875 at his sister's home, Castle Malgwyn, near Llechryd in Cardiganshire, where he had spent the winters since 1869; he was buried on 29 June at St Llawddog's Church, Cilgerran, Pembrokeshire. Logan was unmarried; mothers with daughters, perceiving Logan as an eligible bachelor, were told &#145;other rocks than &#147;rock the cradle&#148; claim my whole attention&#146;  (Bell, 23). Canada honoured a native son by giving the name Mount Logan to its highest mountain (elevation nearly 20,000 feet), located in the south-west corner of the Yukon, and in 1998 the Canadian news magazine <span class="italic">Macleans</span> named him among the most important figures in Canadian history.<br>
