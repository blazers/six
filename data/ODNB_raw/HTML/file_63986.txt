<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lawton,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tommy]</span></span>  (1919&#150;1996), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born at 43 Macdonald Street, Farnworth, near Bolton, on 6 October 1919, the son of Thomas Lawton, a signalman on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway, and his wife, Elizabeth Riley, a weaver at the Harrowby mill. His parents separated when Thomas was eighteen months old and he went with his mother to live with his grandfather James Hugh Riley, in a two-up and two-down terrace house off the Folds Road, near the centre of Bolton. Lawton's uncles were all keen recreational footballers and introduced their nephew to the pleasures of both street football and, later, Sunday games for side stakes. Lawton's mother and grandfather were probably most influential in shaping his early career.<br>
<br>Tommy Lawton was an outstanding schoolboy footballer at Tonge Moor council school and Castle Hill and Folds Road central school (he scored an astonishing 570 goals in three seasons for the latter) and for Hayes Athletic, a Bolton league side for whom he played on Saturday afternoons. He played for Lancashire schools in 1933 and 1934 but strangely never for England at schoolboy level. As a fifteen-year-old Lawton played for Rossendale United in the semi-professional Lancashire combination, by which time he was working in a Bolton tannery, although Football League clubs queued up to take him out of it. Sheffield Wednesday almost signed him but his mother thought Sheffield was too far away from their Bolton home. Instead Lawton signed amateur forms for Burnley, who gave him a job in their office at &pound;2 10<i>s</i>. a week&#151;good money for a sixteen-year-old in 1935. The club also had to find a place for Granddad Riley, who became an assistant groundsman at &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. a week. Soon the Riley family were given a rent-free house in Brunshaw Road, Burnley. Lawton made his d&eacute;but in the first team, at sixteen and a half, and signed as a professional in October 1936 on wages of &pound;7 a week, with bonuses of &pound;2 for a win and &pound;1 for a draw. Granddad Riley had tried, but failed, to secure a signing-on fee of &pound;500. Four days later Lawton scored three goals in a second-division match against Tottenham Hotspur. If this was a nice return on a modest investment, an even more satisfying one quickly followed when in January 1937 Everton paid Burnley &pound;5400 for his transfer.<br>
<br>Everton clearly saw Lawton as a replacement for Dixie Dean, and he did not disappoint. In 1937&#150;8 he was the leading goal-scorer in the first division with twenty-eight goals and the following season, 1938&#150;9, his thirty-five goals were crucial in the winning of the league championship. A well-built 5 feet 11 inches, Lawton was muscular and sharp. He shot well with both feet, but it was his heading ability which was really exceptional. The timing and height of his leaps were unsurpassed. From his boots to the heavily slicked centre-parted hair he was a menacing handful for any defence. Lawton's presence on away grounds would put thousands on the &#145;gate&#146;. He was as much of a star as either Stanley Matthews or later, Tom Finney, but his twenty-year career in professional football was not the complete triumph it ought to have been. Like many other players of his generation, he had six years wrenched out of his prime by the Second World War. He also had a knack of falling out with his employers, and his half a dozen transfers, particularly in an era of the maximum wage, look eccentric and suggest a restless streak which he was unable to control. On the field Lawton was never booked or sent off, but off the field his character was an odd mixture of shyness and assertiveness. Only at Everton was he at the right club at the right time, and the disruption of war meant that he had little time to fulfil his potential.<br>
<br>In 1938 Lawton was selected for England while still in his teens, and in 1939 he headed the winning goal in a famous victory over Scotland. When, in 1940, the army asked the Football Association to provide a list of players to be trained as physical training instructors, Lawton was one of those selected. Based in Aldershot, he played a lot of wartime football, including twenty-three games for England. On 15 January 1941 he married Rosaleen May Kavanagh (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), daughter of Thomas Kavanagh. The marriage ended in divorce in 1951. After being demobilized in 1945 Lawton moved again, after arranging his own transfer from Everton to Chelsea for &pound;11,500. The main purpose of the change appears to have been to improve the state of his marriage. Looking back thirty years later, Lawton thought that he should have stayed with Everton and transferred his wife. He arrived at Chelsea just in time to play in their spectacular match against Moscow Dynamo. He liked London but stayed for only one full season with a team who were notorious under-achievers, even though his twenty-six goals that season were a club record. Instead Lawton surprised the football world by joining Notts County in 1947 for a fee of &pound;20,000, a new British record. They were an unexceptional team which for several years before the war had been embedded in the middle of the southern section of the third division of the league. However, the club had potential, and Lawton began to realize some of it. Crowds rose from an average of 9,000 to 35,000, and in 1949&#150;50 the championship was won and with it promotion to the second division. The success did not last.<br>
<br>In the meantime Lawton had become the first post-war player from the third division to be selected for England, for whom he appeared three times in 1948. But he was never picked again, even though he was only twenty-nine and remained a regular goal scorer with Notts County with ninety goals in 151 matches. The rest of his career was sombrely anti-climactic. In 1952 he moved to second-division Brentford, where he became player&#150;manager in the new year. Results were poor, the crowd critical, and he soon resigned as manager while continuing as a player. He had also been cited as co-respondent in a divorce case. On 23 September 1952 he married the woman, Gladys May Rose (<i>b</i>. 1919/20), daughter of Wilfred Ruebin Seabrooke, master decorator, whom he later called the love of his life. There was an even more surprising twist to his football career. In September 1953, at thirty-four, he was bought by Arsenal, whose young side had made a disappointing start to the season. Although he failed to score until March and was not a regular member of the first team, he did act as a catalyst in the improvement of the team. In 1956 he left Highbury to become player&#150;manager of Kettering Town. He led them to the southern league championship in 1956&#150;7, a success which led back to Notts County and the manager's office. The club suffered relegation from the second division at the end of the season and Lawton left, to spend the next four years as landlord of the Magna Carta pub in Lowdham, a village near Nottingham.<br>
<br>It has often been said that great players do not necessarily make good managers. Most players made little preparation for the end of their careers and there were certainly no training courses for management. Lawton later said that his mistake had been to leave the first division for Notts County and in self-critical mood reflected that perhaps great playing success had made him over-confident. It may not have helped that he was opposed to modern coaching. Lawton had another managerial stint at Kettering in 1963&#150;4 and was coach and chief scout at Notts County between 1968 and 1970. His 231 goals in 390 league games and his 22 in 23 matches for England did not insure him against a difficult middle age. Lawton found it hard to keep jobs for long and was involved in several failed business enterprises. He worked as a salesman for a firm making grandstand seats but he suffered a heart attack in 1970 and by 1972 was unemployed and in debt. It was a sad decline from his three seasons as a star player at Notts County, when he may have earned as much as &pound;3000 a year, drove a grey Sunbeam Talbot sports car, and was probably the first surtax-paying footballer. Old footballing friends Andy Beattie, Matt Busby, and Joe Mercer persuaded Everton to arrange a testimonial match in 1972 which raised &pound;6300, but Lawton continued to find it difficult to make ends meet. Two court appearances for minor fraud led to three years' probation in 1972 and 200 hours of community service in 1974. In 1984, at sixty-five, he was &#145;rediscovered&#146; by the <span class="italic">Nottingham Evening Post</span> and his conversations with journalists were turned into a weekly football column. His wife died in 1988, after which declining health forced Lawton into sheltered accommodation. He died on 6 November 1996 at his home, Abbeyfield, 49 Rosedale Road, Bakersfield, Nottingham, leaving a daughter, Amanda, by his first wife and a stepdaughter, Carol, and a son, Tommy, by his second.<br>
