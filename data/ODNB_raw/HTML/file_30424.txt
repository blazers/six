<span class="headword">Anstey,  Francis George <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1865&#150;1940), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born on 18 August 1865 in York Road Hospital, Lambeth, London, the only son of the recently deceased Samuel Anstey (1837/8&#150;1865), master shoemaker, and his wife, Caroline Martha (1840?&#150;1922), daughter of Francis Gamble, distillery foreman. Anstey's childhood was unsettled. At three he was sent to live with the Ansteys near Witheridge, Devon, an area which lingered in his imagination. After Caroline had married the labourer John Lank on 25 September 1869, she reclaimed young Frank and the new family began a precarious working life on the railway extension from Settle to Carlisle, tramping through the north and midlands until finally settling at Silvertown, London. Caroline had two sons with Lank: Thomas Gamble, who was born on 10 January 1871 at Settle and William Wallace, born 27 April 1877 at London. Soon afterwards, in an act of youthful rebellion, Frank stowed away in the Blackwall clipper <i>Melbourne</i> at the Victoria docks, before eventually jumping ship at Sydney; from there he worked as a cabin boy throughout the south Pacific and, later, as a seaman along the east coast of Australia, an experience he subsequently embellished into racy political parables.<br>
<br>As a wharf labourer in Sydney, Anstey interested himself in the burgeoning labour movement's radical nationalism. In 1888 he settled in Melbourne, where, it appears, he married Catherine Mary Bell McColl (1865&#150;1937) on or about 1 January 1889. Despite unemployment and temporary separation enforced by the economic slump, they had two children: Ward Eugene, who was born on 23 September 1889 at Melbourne and Daron, born on 31 May 1891 at Sale. Driven by adversity and restless energy, Anstey became a trade union and Labor Party activist: he helped to establish the labour weekly <span class="italic">Tocsin</span> in 1897 and, in 1898, the Victorian Labour Federation, a short-lived co-operative modelled on the Belgian Workers' Party.<br>
<br>Anstey won the Victorian legislative assembly seat of East Bourke Boroughs for Labor in 1902, then Brunswick in 1904, a seat he held until 1910. A stocky figure, given to extravagant gesticulation, Anstey was a forceful, occasionally vitriolic, parliamentary orator. He was particularly severe on moral reformers' attempts to restrict gambling and the liquor trade, conducting a robust defence of masculine working-class culture. An indefatigable organizer, he undertook several country recruiting tours, some with the English socialist Tom Mann. These informed his grand plan for the &#145;closer settlement&#146; of rural Victoria by small farmers, inspired partly by an idealized Devonish yeomanry, and published as <span class="italic">Monopoly and Democracy</span> (1906). In 1907 he returned to Britain, where he campaigned in the Jarrow by-election and reported on the Stuttgart congress of the Socialist International.<br>
<br>In 1910 Anstey won the seat of Bourke in the commonwealth parliament, where he further developed his interest in the monetary system. In 1914 his socialist-inspired opposition to war brought him into conflict with old friends such as W. M. Hughes, whom he bitterly opposed in the 1916 Labor split over conscription. During the war he elaborated a populist political economy of finance capital, arguing that the &#145;money power&#146; was a sinister, &#145;behind the scenes&#146; force in modern capitalism. These publications began with <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Shylock</span> (1915; rev. edn, 1917), and concluded with <span class="italic">Money Power</span> (1921). He secretly departed for London, via the United States, in 1918, was appointed to an Australian press mission to Ireland and the western front, visited Paris during the peace conference, and went to Scandinavia to gather material for his book <span class="italic">Red Europe</span> (1919). This dramatic account of the Russian revolution and civil war established him as a leader of Labor's left in the post-war &#145;red dawn&#146;. In 1922 he was elected assistant leader of the opposition in the house of representatives, where he developed a robustly adversarial relationship with Stanley Melbourne Bruce, who calmly deflected Anstey's biting sarcasm, mocking irony, or gentle wit. But the passionate intensity that drove Anstey's theatrical oratory was unsuited to the steady, purposeful work of parliamentary leadership. In 1927, disgusted by factional intrigue, he returned to the back benches and, having no superannuation, took an interest in a New Guinea goldmine with the shadowy businessman John Wren.<br>
<br>When the Labor government headed by J. H. Scullin was elected in 1929, Anstey was given the health and repatriation portfolio, which he conducted with reasonable competence under the guidance of talented public servants. However, he was dumped from the ministry in March 1931 because he supported the Lang plan in opposition to the deflationary fiscal policy recommended by the Bank of England's Sir Otto Niemeyer. Thereafter he retreated into an embittered cynicism, barely survived the December 1931 electoral landslide against Labor, and resigned his seat in 1934. He retired to a Bondi flat in Sydney, where he wrote fragmentary memoirs and tendentious historical sketches until his wife died on 21 November 1937. He returned to Melbourne to live with an old friend, Harriet Middlecoat, at 46 Park Street, West Brunswick, where he died of cancer on 31 October 1940. He was cremated at Fawkner cemetery, Melbourne, on 1 November.<br>
