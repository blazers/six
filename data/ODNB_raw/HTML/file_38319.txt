<span class="headword">Meryon,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1807, <em>d.</em> 1880), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was baptized in Rye, Sussex, on 10 December 1807, the son of John Meryon (<i>bap</i>. 1776, <i>d</i>. 1857), harbour commissioner, merchant, and innkeeper, who was descended from a Huguenot family who emigrated to England from France about 1682, and Jane Gatland or Gateland (<i>bap</i>. 1787, <i>d</i>. 1858), of Rye, spinster and dressmaker. He was the nephew of Charles Lewis Meryon (1783&#150;1877). Edward's parents never married and little is known of his early life. However, in 1829 he entered the newly established London University to study medicine, where he was an outstanding student, gaining many distinctions and prizes. Between 1830 and 1831 he was apprenticed to Frederick Bellingham, an apothecary. In 1831 Meryon became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries, London. Meryon married Catherine Baily (<i>bap</i>. 1811, <i>d</i>. 1897) of Falkingham, Lincolnshire, on 5 February 1833 and the couple had four daughters&#151;Lucy Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1834), Anne (<i>b</i>. 1835), Julia (<i>b</i>. 1841), Evelyn Jane (<i>b</i>. 1846)&#151;followed by a son, John Edward (1851&#150;1896).<br>
<br>In 1836 Meryon published <span class="italic">The Physical and Intellectual Constitution of Man Considered</span> and in 1838 he went into partnership with Thomas Wood, surgeon, at 4 Bolton Street. In 1840 Meryon became one of the founder members of the Microscopical Society of London. Two years later he was appointed lecturer in comparative anatomy at St Thomas's Hospital, London, and in 1844 was awarded an MD degree from the University of London. Meryon gradually established himself as a respected physician with a special interest in nervous and muscle diseases. In 1846 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London (later to become the Royal Society of Medicine). In 1850 he became a member of the Athenaeum and had his portrait painted by John Linnell. It was exhibited that year at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>In December 1851 Meryon presented a paper, &#145;On granular and fatty degeneration of the voluntary muscles&#146;, at a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. This was published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the society the following year  (<span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 35, 1852, 73&#150;84). Some years later he expanded his observations in a chapter of his book, <span class="italic">Practical and Pathological Researches on the Various Forms of Paralysis</span> (1864). In these two publications he reported his studies on several extensive families with a disease subsequently to be referred to as Duchenne muscular dystrophy after Duchenne de Boulogne (1806&#150;1875), who described the disease some years later. In fact Edward Meryon was the first to make a systematic and detailed study of the disease. He showed that the disorder affected only males, was familial, essentially a disease of muscle and <i>not</i> the nervous system because he demonstrated that the spinal cord was normal, and finally, based on his microscopic observations, he concluded that the basic defect was a breakdown of the muscle fibre membrane (sarcolemma). These observations were made many years before Duchenne and others. In fact it was some 135 years later that the basic defect was proved to be the absence of the muscle fibre membrane protein dystrophin.<br>
<br>Several factors might account for the fact that Meryon's contributions went unrecognized at the time of their publication. His paper presented to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and later published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the society in 1852, was a relatively brief article running to just twelve pages. This was enlarged into a short chapter (fifteen pages) in his <span class="italic">Practical and Pathological Researches</span>. By comparison, Duchenne's main contributions on muscular dystrophy were published in several very extensive papers (totalling 124 pages) in a single year, 1868. In addition, Duchenne incorrectly dismissed Meryon's publication of 1852 as describing cases of &#145;progressive muscular atrophy&#146;, a neurogenic disorder, rather than muscular dystrophy, a disease of muscle. This misinterpretation by Duchenne was perpetuated by later researchers, and though corrected in a publication in 1879 by Sir William Gowers, Meryon's contribution never gained the recognition given to Duchenne for having first described childhood muscular dystrophy. Duchenne was perhaps also a better publicist of his findings than Meryon.<br>
<br>Meryon was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1857, and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1859. In 1861 he published a first volume of <span class="italic">The History of Medicine</span>, but planned further volumes were never completed. He was a council member of the Geological Society (1862&#150;4) and vice-president 1865 and the following year published some further observations, in his &#145;On granular degeneration of the voluntary muscles&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1, 1866, 258&#150;60).<br>
<br>In 1869 Meryon was elected vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. From this time his main hospital appointment was as physician to the newly established London Infirmary for Epilepsy and Paralysis, which eventually moved to Portland Terrace, Regent's Park, as the Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System.<br>
<br>Meryon's <span class="italic">On the functions of the sympathetic system of nerves, as a physiological basis for a rational system of therapeutics</span> (1872) drew heavily in the first part on the work of the celebrated French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813&#150;1878). In the second part, however, Meryon emphasized the possible future role of the system in therapy, prescient by some fifty years of subsequent work on neurotransmission. In 1875 he was elected to the council of the Royal College of Physicians. About this time he also wrote a play, partly in verse, entitled <span class="italic">The Huguenot</span> (1876), a historical romance between a young Catholic girl and her childhood love who was a Huguenot, set in France in 1572 at the time of the St Bartholomew's day massacre.<br>
<br>Meryon resigned his hospital appointment owing to ill health in 1879 and died on 8 November 1880 at his home, 14 Clarges Street, Piccadilly, London, from heart disease and gout. He was buried at Brompton cemetery, London, on 12 November. His obituaries demonstrate that he was a much-liked and respected physician. Meryon bequeathed everything to his wife, Catherine, the estate being valued at less than &pound;4000.<br>
