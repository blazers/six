<span class="headword">Tschichold,  Jan</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Johannes Tzschichhold]</span>  (1902&#150;1974), <span class="occ">typographer and writer</span>, was born on 2 April 1902 at Leipzig, the eldest son of the sign-painter Franz Tzschichhold (1878&#150;1947) and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Zapff (1874&#150;1947). He was educated successively between 1916 and 1923 at the teacher-training college at Grimma, near Leipzig, and in Leipzig at various graphic arts academies. He married on 31 March 1926 Edith Kramer (1905&#150;1986), a journalist; their son Peter was born in 1929. They lived mainly in Basel from 1933 to 1968, when they moved to Berzona, Ticino, Italy. He died in hospital in Locarno, Italy, on 11 August 1974, and was buried on 13 August.<br>
<br>Tschichold lectured on typography and lettering at Leipzig and later at the school for German master printers at Munich. After the Nazi government terminated this appointment and placed Tschichold and his family in &#145;protective custody&#146; in 1933, he moved to Basel to write and practise as a freelance typographer. Although never connected with the Bauhaus, he was an early exponent of asymmetrical design and the use of sans-serif types, exemplified in his first book, the didactic <span class="italic">Die neue Typographie</span> (&#145;The new typography&#146;, 1928), and in the less dogmatic <span class="italic">Typographische Gestaltung</span> (&#145;Typographic design&#146;, 1935). Later work for Swiss publishers employed traditional centred designs and seriffed types.<br>
<br>Tschichold was a masterly typographer in many media, particularly books, posters, and commercial jobbing printing, where his constant search for transparent clarity and fashionable predilection for asymmetric design ensured a steady demand for his services. By middle age, however, he was a leading advocate of traditional centred design for books and acknowledged as a leader in this craft. He is best known in Britain for his subtle and magisterial typographical redesign of Penguin books between 1947 and 1949, when he was living at the Old Mill House, West Drayton, Middlesex. Without obtrusively disturbing the familiar format and livery of the various series, he imposed on Penguin's printers the highest standards of design, composition, and page make-up consistent with mass production. These standards, similar to those already employed by discerning publishers and printers such as the Oxford and Cambridge university presses, were taken up enthusiastically by many others who wished to produce books of a quality to match the Penguins, which had achieved a commanding position in both popular and accessibly scholarly publishing during the Second World War. The Penguin composition rules written by Tschichold to codify his requirements showed the way to a more professional attitude to book production among emerging British book designers.<br>
<br>Tschichold was an accomplished designer of types. Sabon, designed between 1964 and 1967, is a masterpiece. It was the first typeface to be designed for hand composition and hot-metal setting on the Monotype (single-character) and Linotype (line of type) composition systems, has triumphantly survived adaptation to photo-composition, and is today one of the most popular typefaces for bookwork.<br>
<br>Like his English counterpart Stanley Morison, Tschichold was a fluent and assertive writer on typographic design and widely read in the history of printing. He had a particular interest in Chinese and Japanese calligraphy and Chinese colour printing, on which he published six works between 1940 and 1970.<br>
