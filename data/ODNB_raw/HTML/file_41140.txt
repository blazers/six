<span class="headword">Duckham, Sir  Arthur McDougall</span>  (1879&#150;1932), <span class="occ">gas engineer</span>, was born on 8 July 1879 at Blackheath, London, the second of the three sons of Frederick Elliot Duckham (1841&#150;1918), a noted civil engineer, and his wife, Maud Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDougall. All the sons achieved prominence in their chosen careers: the eldest, William Duckham, ran a harbour works company, and Alexander Duckham, the youngest, established the Duckham oil company. Arthur, known to family and close friends as Bob, was educated at Blackheath proprietary school; he left aged seventeen to become an articled pupil in the South Metropolitan Gas Company under the chief engineer, Frank Livesey, younger brother of the chairman, Sir George Livesey.<br>
<br>During his training Duckham studied carbonization, furnace work, and chemical engineering, supplementing his practical work with evening study in engineering at King's College, London. At the age of twenty he was appointed assistant superintendent of the Old Kent Road works of South Metropolitan. Two years later he left to become assistant engineer of the Bournemouth Gas and Water Company under Harold Woodall, who was to become a lifelong friend. With Woodall's active encouragement, Duckham began experimenting with methods of changing the carbonization process from a cyclical to a continuous one. He concentrated on the development of vertical retorts (in place of the traditional horizontal retorts), where coal fell by gravity and, after gasification, was extracted from the bottom as coke. He and Woodall entered into partnership in 1903 and set up Woodall&#150;Duckham Ltd in 1906 to exploit Duckham's process. At first the company provided only a design service and relied on specialist suppliers and contractors to meet its production specifications, but by the early 1920s it was also undertaking installations on its own account. As an indication of the economic advantages of the process, within twenty years approximately half of all the coal used in British gasworks was carbonized in continuous vertical retorts.<br>
<br>The success of the Woodall&#150;Duckham company owed at least as much to Duckham's character and his ability as a salesman as to his technical expertise. He was a dominating figure, 6 feet tall and weighing 18 stone, but with the knack of making and keeping friends and of inspiring others, even at the gasworks, by both his example and his ideas. In the early years of the company there were problems of cash flow, but a number of important firms which supplied the gas industry with steelwork, refractories, and other construction parts took shares in the company to ensure its survival. As the company prospered, the minority holdings were later bought out.<br>
<br>After war broke out in 1914, it became essential to supply certain by-products of carbonization, notably toluene and phenol, for the manufacture of explosives. It was therefore natural that Duckham should join the munitions invention department, becoming deputy controller of munitions supply late in 1915. He adapted very well to life in Whitehall, and held a number of executive and administrative appointments during the war: he was chairman of the advisory committee to the minister of munitions, a member of the Munitions Council, director-general for aircraft production, and in 1919 a member of the Air Council. His services were recognized in 1917 when he was made a KCB.<br>
<br>After the war, business at Woodall&#150;Duckham again gathered momentum, expanding to produce plant not only for gasworks but also for other chemical processes. Duckham's career now extended into much wider spheres. Having joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1918 he came to believe that chemical engineers needed a professional body of their own; he chaired a committee formed in 1922 to create what became the Institution of Chemical Engineers and was elected its founder president. He was also president of the Society of British Gas Industries for two years. In 1919 he was appointed to the coal industry commission chaired by Mr Justice Sankey to examine ways to make the industry more economically efficient. Unwilling to support full nationalization, he produced a minority report commending state ownership of mineral rights, the efficient exploitation of coal reserves, minimum wages for miners, and a role for miners in the direction of the industry. As a leading businessman, Duckham was in great demand as a speaker on the problems of both sides of industry.<br>
<br>At the request of the Australian prime minister, in 1928 Duckham was appointed by the British government to lead a group of prominent businessmen on an economic mission to Australia to advise on trade opportunities. The subsequent report described the vast resources in Australia, strongly advocated a firm trade partnership between the two countries (later to be extended to all the Commonwealth), and recommended higher levels of emigration to Australia. Following this mission Duckham was created a GBE in 1929. Further government work followed and Duckham's status as a leading industrial statesman was endorsed by his election as deputy president and president-elect of the Federation of British Industries (FBI). He was also a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>In 1903 Arthur Duckham married Maud, eldest daughter of the painter A. D. Peppercorn; they had three children. Through his wife's interest he became an enthusiast for the arts. He was also something of a gourmet, and he enjoyed golf, dancing, tennis, and squash. Before he could take office as president of the FBI he collapsed at his home, High Warren, Ashtead, Surrey, after his regular game of squash, and died on 14 February 1932, aged fifty-two. He was buried at St Giles, Ashtead, and there was a memorial service for him at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 17 February. His wife survived him.<br>
