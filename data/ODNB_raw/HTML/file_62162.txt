<span class="headword">Clibborn,  Stanley Eric Francis  Booth-</span>  (1924&#150;1996), <span class="occ">bishop of Manchester</span>, was born in London on 20 October 1924. He was the grandson of the eldest daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49017/', "Catherine Booth-Clibborn")</script>, of General William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, and was the son of the Revd John Eric Booth-Clibborn (1895&#150;1924), Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Lucille, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leonard (1903&#150;1989). Educated at Highgate school, Middlesex, he was drafted into the Royal Artillery (1942&#150;5) and the Royal Indian Artillery (1946&#150;7), in which he became a temporary captain. After military service he read modern history at Oriel College, Oxford, receiving a second-class degree in 1950, and then prepared for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge. He served as curate of Heeley in the Sheffield diocese of Bishop Leslie Hunter from 1952 to 1954, and subsequently in the Attercliffe parishes (then at the heart of the steel industry) from 1954 to 1956.<br>
<br>In 1956 Booth-Clibborn made a major move to become training secretary of the Christian Council of Kenya (until 1963) and, after that, chief editor of East African Venture Newspapers (1963&#150;7). At a time when the Church of England was still dominant in the Anglican communion, Africa gave him a refreshingly different slant on the church in England in his later ministry, as it had to face great changes in its position both at home and overseas. His years in Africa in an ecumenical job reinforced his commitment to the ecumenical movement for both the unity and renewal of the churches and for its emphasis on the cause of the poor and marginalized. He saw the urgency of preparing Christians in Kenya for leadership as the British empire was dismantled. This meant their taking politics seriously. His outspoken newspapers offended the more evangelical Christians who regarded politics as a dirty business, and also the colonial administrations, which the papers frequently criticized. For a time one of them was suppressed. When Booth-Clibborn realized that he would not again get editorial freedom he returned to the UK. However, Africa remained a continual concern for him and his family. On 15 February 1958 he had married Anne Roxburgh Forrester (<i>b</i>. 1926), the daughter of Professor William and Margaret Forrester, both influential members of the Church of Scotland, and this increased his ecumenical concern. His wife later became deputy chair of Christian Aid in the UK, with special responsibility for Africa. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>On his return to the UK, Booth-Clibborn was asked to take charge of the Lincoln Centre Team ministry, but three years later he was called to the university church, Great St Mary's, Cambridge, which had a vigorous ministry to the town but also to students, particularly with its late Sunday evening service, to which speakers of national and international significance came. He maintained its vigour for nine years. By now his energy, communication skills, and leadership qualities were well known, and it was no surprise that in 1979 he was nominated to the see of Manchester, a diocese whose importance was equalled by its problems. The world's first industrial city was now the centre of a conurbation which was a northern metropolis, a dynamic city, with a rapidly changing industrial and commercial base. But the diocese included all the poorer areas and few of the more prosperous ones, except the city centre; and most of those who worked there lived outside the diocesan boundary. Of the just over 300 parishes, two-thirds were shortly to be classed as urban priority areas, or almost so, an indication of the problems of unemployment, crime, and vandalism which they faced. The church had inherited too much plant from the Victorian expansion, much of it inflexible and unsuitable, and many parishes were having a hard struggle. Booth-Clibborn liked Manchester but he could not in one diocese solve the wider problems of the Church of England. He reorganized his diocese into three episcopal areas, each of just over 100 parishes, which made it more efficient in terms of the existing structures of the Church of England and also more pastorally cared for. On a wider scale he played a full part in the general synod and its standing committee, and he took his membership of the House of Lords very seriously, hard as it was to fit it in with diocesan duties. He was a public figure, often called upon by the media for comments, especially in the early years, when little of public interest was said by the then archbishops of Canterbury and York. He always expressed himself clearly without evasions. His arrival in Manchester coincided with the Thatcher years in politics, and those who approved of them regarded him as a dangerous radical, but in fact he stood for the kind of consensus which was associated with the earlier post-war years. Broadly his theology and social ethics were those associated with William Temple, and were acceptable not only to the Labour Party, of which he was a member, but also to most Liberals and a considerable number of Conservatives, often called &#145;wets&#146; by the new protagonists in that party. His one book, <span class="italic">Taxes: Burden or Blessing?</span> (1991), was mainly a reasoned defence of direct taxation as a way of discharging civic responsibility, hostility to which was characteristic of the Thatcher years.<br>
<br>Booth-Clibborn was a keen advocate of women's ministry and was the first moderator of the Movement for the Ordination of Women (1989&#150;92). During his time in Manchester he also retained his connection with Africa, making several visits to Namibia and establishing a special relationship between that diocese and the Manchester diocese. Ill health dogged his retirement, after 1992, but his work in Manchester, which had already been recognized by Manchester Polytechnic in 1989, was further honoured by the conferment of the degree of DD by Manchester University in 1994. He died in Edinburgh (to where he and his wife had retired), following major heart surgery and a stroke, on 6 March 1996. He was cremated in Edinburgh on 12 March and his ashes were interred in Manchester Cathedral on 29 March. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
