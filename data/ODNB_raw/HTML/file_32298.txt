<span class="headword">Car&ouml;e,  William Douglas</span>  (1857&#150;1938), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 1 September 1857 at Holmesdale, Blundellsands, near Liverpool, the younger son of Anders Kruuse Car&ouml;e (<i>d</i>. 1897), Danish consul at Liverpool and a naturalized British subject, and his wife, Jane Kirkpatrick Green (<i>d</i>. 1877). He was educated at Ruabon grammar school, Denbighshire, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a senior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1879.<br>
<br>Car&ouml;e was articled first, in 1879, to Edmund Kirby, an architect of Liverpool, and after one year his articles were transferred to John Loughborough Pearson, with whom he remained on a gradually diminishing part-time basis while he built up his own practice. In 1891 he married Grace Desborough, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rendall (<i>d</i>. 1947), with whom he had one daughter and two sons, the elder of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30901/', "Sir Olaf Kirkpatrick Kruuse Caroe (1892&#150;1981)")</script>, Indian administrator. It was at this period that he was responsible under Pearson for a great deal of the detailing of Truro Cathedral. His own practice at that time included a large amount of work in Ireland&#151;houses, farm buildings, and stables&#151;and his church work in England grew rapidly. In 1885 he was appointed architect to the ecclesiastical commissioners and the Charity Commission, where Pearson's brother-in-law Ewan Christian was then senior architect, a post to which Car&ouml;e succeeded on Christian's death in 1895, and which he then held for the remainder of his life. From 1897 to 1903 Car&ouml;e was in partnership with Christian's nephew J. H. Christian, of Christian and Purday, who designed Mombasa Cathedral (1901&#150;4). From 1903 he went into partnership with his assistant Herbert Passmore, who continued the work of the firm after Car&ouml;e's death, when the latter was succeeded by his son Alban Douglas Rendall Car&ouml;e.<br>
<br>A vast amount of ecclesiastical work passed through Car&ouml;e's hands in these years. He acted as consulting architect to the diocesan boards of finance of Lichfield, Canterbury, Bath and Wells, and Newcastle upon Tyne. He was architect to the cathedrals of Canterbury, Durham, Southwell, St David's, Brecon, and Jerusalem, and to many churches, including Great Malvern Priory, Tewkesbury Abbey, Romsey Abbey, and St Peter's, Wolverhampton. He built or reconstructed the archbishop's palace at Canterbury, and the bishops' palaces at Abergwili, Southwell (1907&#150;8), Bristol (1905; des.), St Albans, Llandaff, Rochester, and Wolvesey (Winchester). He also designed many substantial suburban churches, including that of St David, Exeter (1897&#150;1900). He designed internal fittings for many hundreds of medieval churches, including woodwork in Winchester College chapel, and between the years 1887 and 1937 he was responsible for the structural restoration of many medieval buildings; in 1910 he carried out important restoration work on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, recorded in an etching by Muirhead Bone. He designed the monuments to Archbishop Temple in Canterbury Cathedral, to Bishop Owen in St David's Cathedral, to Bishop Satterlee and Bishop Harding in Washington Cathedral, USA, and to Bishop Ridding in Southwell Cathedral. He was a member of the first commission on St Paul's Cathedral in 1912, and acted as adviser to the Norwegian government on Trondheim Cathedral.<br>
<br>Car&ouml;e's secular work includes the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire at Cardiff, the Teddington laboratories of the National Physical Laboratory, the offices of the ecclesiastical commissioners in Millbank (1903), flats in Knightsbridge (1901), Coleherne Court, Kensington (1901&#150;3), 37&#150;43 Park Street, Mayfair, boarding-houses at Wycombe Abbey School (1898&#150;1910), and new buildings for Trinity and Pembroke colleges, Cambridge (1905&#150;7).<br>
<br>Car&ouml;e received the order of St Olaf of Norway, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1890. He was president of the Architectural Association in 1895&#150;6 and became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. His publications include <span class="italic">Sefton</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">King's Hostel, Trinity College, Cambridge</span> (1909); he also edited <span class="italic">&#145;Tom Tower&#146;, Christ Church, Oxford: some Letters of Sir C. Wren to J. Fell</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Car&ouml;e was a man of forceful character and great energy and business capacity. A recent historian noted that, &#145;his early churches established him as the leading Arts and Crafts Gothic church architect outside the High Church party&#146;  (Bettley, 2.10). His metropolitan works in warm red brick were richly arrayed, and his remarkable offices for the church commissioners in Millbank gave architectural expression to the theme of &#145;a Church jubilant&#146;  (Gray, 135). In the same year as his Millbank project Car&ouml;e designed the working men's college in Crowndale Road, London, and he took an active interest in the work of the college. From his home at Vann, Hambledon, Surrey, he gave his professional services gratis to community projects, and founded the Fold County Rural Preservation Society. One of the first building conservators, this aspect of his work has been continued by his grandson Martin Bragg Caroe FSA in the firm Car&ouml;e &amp; Partners. Car&ouml;e's career extended to the design of furniture and metalwork, sculpture and embroidery. He maintained an interest in Scandinavia and was an authority on the vikings.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Car&ouml;e retired to Cyprus, where he took an active interest in preserving the antiquities of the island: his last published work was <span class="italic">The Importance of the Historical Buildings of Cyprus</span> (1931). He died on 25 February 1938 at Latomia, a house he had built in Kyrenia, Cyprus, and was buried in the old British cemetery in Kyrenia.<br>
