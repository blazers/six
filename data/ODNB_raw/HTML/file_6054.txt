<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cond&eacute;,  Jean <span class="st"> [John]</span></span>  (1765&#150;1794), <span class="occ">printmaker</span>, was the son of a stonemason in Paris, and his wife, Louise Crantin. His name first appears in the &#145;registre des &eacute;l&egrave;ves&#146; of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris on 20 March 1781: &#145;Jean Cond&eacute;, Peintre natif de Paris, &acirc;g&eacute; de 15 ans &frac12;, prot&eacute;g&eacute; par M. Pierre [the painter Jean-Baptiste Marie Pierre], demeurans enclos de Ste Genevi&egrave;ve, chez son p&egrave;re Tailleur de pierre au B&acirc;timent de Ste Genevi&egrave;ve&#146;  (Paris, &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, MS 823, fol. 64). During September of that year it was noted that he was a pupil of the engraver Lempereur, and in March 1782 of Boizot. Further references are made in the same source up until 1786. In October 1785 he won the third medal in the painting category of the competition organized by the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. That work is now preserved in the collection of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts. In a similar competition held during January 1787 Cond&eacute; won the second medal, and at this time he became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David.<br>
<br>In 1787 Cond&eacute; travelled from Paris to London with the print publisher John Boydell. His plans to work in London are likely to have been encouraged after David had met Richard and Maria Cosway on their visit to Paris from August to October 1786. In autumn 1787 he enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy Schools in London; by the end of that year he had won a silver medal for a drawing after the life, and he won a similar medal in 1792. Early in 1788 he returned to Paris and showed off his prize to David, who wrote to Maria Cosway: &#145;Cond&eacute; showed me the medal which England had awarded him; this decision gives me a fair idea of London's Academy. Here, a man such as Cond&eacute;, coming from nowhere, would not even have been allowed to enter the competition&#146;  (Daniell, vi). Cond&eacute; also brought back to David a present for his master of one of the engraved portraits after Richard Cosway of <span class="italic">George, Prince of Wales</span> (almost certainly that engraved in stipple by L. Sailliar in 1787), a gift which David held in high esteem.<br>
<br>In the eight years up until his premature death, Cond&eacute; enjoyed a successful career as an engraver; there are forty-six portraits known to have been engraved by him. He enjoyed a particularly close business relationship with Cosway, who may have painted his portrait in miniature (now untraced). Cond&eacute; reproduced seventeen of Cosway's elegant and refined compositions in stipple; they are engraved in pale delicate tints, using stipple, sanguine, or aquatint. He also enhanced the compositions by enclosing them in frame-like borders, called glomisages after the French engraver Jean-Baptiste Glomy, who had first designed them. Among the ten portraits by Cosway that Cond&eacute; engraved were those of <span class="italic">Mrs Fitzherbert</span> (1792), <span class="italic">Madame Du Barry</span> (1794), <span class="italic">George, Prince of Wales</span> (1795), and the diplomatist and wit <span class="italic">Caleb Whitefoord</span> (1806), and the seven subject compositions by Cosway he reproduced include the pair of <span class="italic">Andromache and Ascanius</span> and <span class="italic">Polindo and Albarosa, docet amor</span> (all 1791), <span class="italic">Minerva Directing the Arrows of Cupid</span>, and <span class="italic">Queen Margaret of Anjou and her Son</span> (1795). The account book belonging to Cond&eacute;'s brother <a href="#cosubject_75905">Pierre [<i>see below</i>]</a>, covering the years 1795 to 1821, which is currently untraced, noted the sales to various London printsellers of his engraving after Cosway as well as after other artists. The volume also contained three pencil drawings by Jean, which were probably portraits. Pierre charged different prices for different types of impressions: for example, for Jean's engraving of <span class="italic">Mrs Fitzherbert</span>, the prices were 8<i>s</i>. (ordinary), 12<i>s</i>. (half-coloured), and 16<i>s</i>. (coloured and proof). Jean engraved portraits of celebrities for <span class="italic">The European</span> and other magazines and produced engravings after portraits of actors after De Wilde, or from the life, for <span class="italic">The Thespian</span> magazine. Among the other artists whose work he engraved were Banks, Opie, Romney, Reynolds, Russell, and Stuart. In 1791 he engraved from his own drawing a portrait of <span class="italic">Mademoiselle La Chevali&egrave;re d'Eon de Beaumont</span>, a notorious transvestite then resident in London, as <span class="italic">Minerva</span>. In the lettering for this print he styled himself as a French artist, who designed this print &#145;as a monument of English generosity and French gratitude&#146;. Cond&eacute; also made portrait drawings, a number of which he engraved. He died, possibly at Richmond, Surrey, in July 1794, leaving money in hand to the value of &pound;52 10<i>s</i>. The valuation of his household furniture, engraved plates, drawings, prints, and tools amounted to &pound;162. He was owed about &pound;80 on various accounts, principally from some of the leading London print publishers, such as Bovi, Colnaghi, Dickinson, Harding, Macklin, and Thompkins (among other publishers of his prints were Bell, Boydell, Fores, Lay, and Sewell), and his own debts amounted to &pound;93, which included accounts for his lodgings at Richmond and bills due to Mr Layton, printer in colours. The final balance of the estate was &pound;177 6<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. As Jean neither married nor had children, this sum was divided up between his brother Pierre, who was administrator of his estate, another brother, Matthieu, his sister Louise, and their mother.<br>
<br>Jean's brother <a name="cosubject_75905"></a><span class="headword">Pierre Cond&eacute;</span>  (1767/8&#150;1840), <span class="occ">printmaker and miniature painter</span>, also born in Paris, moved to London a year after his elder brother and enrolled as a student at the Royal Academy Schools between 28 November 1788 and 24 March 1789, giving his age as twenty-one. After the death of his brother, Pierre engraved in stipple eleven of Richard Cosway's portrait and subject compositions. These included stipple-engravings after portraits of the fashionable mesmerist <span class="italic">J. B. de Mainauduc</span> (1798) and the composer <span class="italic">J. L. Dussek</span> (1800), as well as an etched memorial to the collector <span class="italic">Robert Udny</span> (1802). He also engraved portraits after various other artists, notably Edridge, Gainsborough, Hoppner, Lawrence, Northcote, and Opie.<br>
<br>Cond&eacute; later worked as a portrait miniaturist, and he exhibited his work at the Royal Academy from 1806 to 1824. During this period and up until the end of his life he lived at six successive London addresses, four of which were in the West End and the last two in Camden Town. A rare extant example of his portrait miniatures is that of <span class="italic">Dr Plender</span>, signed and dated 1812 on recto and verso (Dumas Egerton Trust collection on loan to the Scot. NPG). Two oval portrait miniatures in pencil on paper are known: a portrait of the painter <span class="italic">James Northcote</span>, from which Cond&eacute;'s engraving was published in 1795, and a <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1811, are now untraced.<br>
<br>The Cond&eacute; account book included copies of letters by Pierre, mainly to clients, including Lady Athlone in 1804, Lady Holland in 1808, and Lady Petre in 1820. Pierre, who appears to have been somewhat touchy in character, evidently had great difficulty in extracting payment from some of his clients; in later life, unmarried and childless, he seems to have been poor. He expressed the wish that after his death Mr Knock of Jeffreys Street, Camden Town&#151;to whom, in September 1835, he had sold his gold watch for &pound;7&#151;should accept any special prints engraved by his late brother Jean and by himself, and that Mr Knock also choose prints out of his portfolio &#145;as a small testimony of my gratitude of his kindness and friendship to my father and brother and myself&#146;. Pierre Cond&eacute; died in Camden Town, London, in 1840.<br>
