<span class="headword">Cowan, Sir  John</span>, baronet  (1814&#150;1900), <span class="occ">paper manufacturer and political organizer</span>, was born at 5 St John's Street, Edinburgh, on 7 May 1814, one of the eight children to reach maturity of Alexander Cowan (<i>d</i>. 1859), also a paper manufacturer, of Edinburgh and Valleyfield, Penicuik, Midlothian, and his wife, Elizabeth Hall (<i>d</i>. 1829), daughter of George Hall of Crail, Fife, merchant. Two of his three brothers achieved prominence as Liberal politicians. His elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47109/', "Charles Cowan (1801&#150;1889)")</script> defeated T. B. Macaulay at the general election of 1847 and went on to represent Edinburgh for the next twelve years. His younger brother James (1816&#150;1895) likewise represented the city from 1874 to 1882.<br>
<br>In his youth Cowan established a reputation as a dedicated student. After attending Edinburgh high school (where he used to beg his father to let him start the day at 4.15 a.m.) he continued his education at the universities of Edinburgh and Bonn. He then joined his brothers in the Penicuik paper-making firm, the original mill of which his grandfather Charles had bought and renamed Valleyfield. In later life Cowan was to head this family business, by then operating under the name of Alexander Cowan &amp; Sons.<br>
<br>Twice married&#151;first, in 1847 or 1848, to Jane Menzies (1820&#150;1854), daughter of Alexander Gillespie of Sunnyside, near Lanark, and second, in 1857 or 1858, to Jane Falconar (1826&#150;1861), daughter of William Currie of Linthill, Roxburghshire&#151;Cowan was from 1861 a widower. Three children died before reaching adulthood.<br>
<br>Cowan was chairman of the Midlothian Liberal Association when the constituency was thrust into national prominence by having W. E. Gladstone as its MP. Under the impetus and sponsorship of the fifth earl of Rosebery and the organizational supervision of W. P. Adam, the Liberal chief whip, Cowan chaired the meetings held in Midlothian to request Gladstone to stand and sent the formal invitation. Gladstone accepted in a public letter addressed to Cowan in late January 1879. In the August of that year it was Cowan who wrote to Gladstone suggesting that he come to the constituency to address the public meetings held in November 1879 which made up Gladstone's first campaign in Midlothian. Although illness prevented Cowan from chairing any of the campaign meetings, he had already played a significant part in the organization of Gladstone's triumphant, if not unexpected, return over Midlothian's sitting Conservative MP, the earl of Dalkeith, at the general election held in April 1880. The Midlothian campaign of late 1879 and its follow-up of March and April 1880 resulted in the establishment of Gladstonianism as the dominant force in Liberal politics.<br>
<br>Cowan was a similarly central figure in all of Gladstone's subsequent re-elections for the county. He was active in national politics also to the extent that he held office in the Scottish Liberal Association and the Scottish Liberal Club. The relationship between Cowan and Gladstone was one marked by great warmth on both sides. Gladstone visited his constituency chairman several times at Beeslack House, Cowan's family home near Penicuik.<br>
<br>Cowan remained loyal to Gladstone when the Liberal Party split over the latter's Irish home-rule policy in 1886. Cowan's record of service and loyalty was recognized when he was created a baronet in 1894. It was to him that Gladstone wrote announcing his intention to stand down as Midlothian's member at the dissolution of 1895.<br>
<br>Like his brothers, Cowan was a founder member of the Free Church of Scotland. The family was related through both his father and his mother to Thomas Chalmers, the Free Church's leading figure in the Disruption of 1843. Cowan was an elder at Penicuik Free Church from 1850. His charitable instinct led him to set up a fund through which a proportion of the family firm's profits were channelled into philanthropic works. During his time as head of the business the Cowan Institute was built as an educational and leisure facility for the people of Penicuik. Cowan was also active in foreign missions and contributed generously to the work of David Livingstone, whom he counted a personal friend.<br>
<br>Cowan died on 26 October 1900 after suffering a heart attack near Beeslack House and was buried on 4 November at Old Glencorse kirkyard, near Penicuik. He was survived by two daughters, the baronetcy becoming extinct on his death.<br>
