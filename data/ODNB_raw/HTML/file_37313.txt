<span class="headword">Cornford,  (Rupert) John</span>  (1915&#150;1936), <span class="occ">poet and political activist</span>, was born in Cambridge on 27 December 1915, the eldest son and second of the five children (three sons and two daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32571/', "Francis Macdonald Cornford (1874&#150;1943)")</script>, professor of ancient philosophy at Cambridge University, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32570/', "Frances Crofts Cornford (1886&#150;1960)")</script>, the poet, daughter of Sir Francis Darwin. Through his mother he was a great-grandson of Charles Darwin. One of his brothers was the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51618/', "Christopher Cornford")</script>. It was ironic that John Cornford should be named Rupert in memory of the poet Rupert Brooke, who had died in April 1915, for Cornford came to despise the school of Georgian poets, of whom Brooke was the supreme exemplar and his mother a loyal adherent. His father described him as &#145;a large, placid baby with very dark eyes and skin and thick black hair &hellip; good-tempered and easy to amuse, even when unwell&#146;, and he showed few indications, as a small boy, of the vigorous intellect and independence of mind that were to flourish so strikingly in adolescence. Initially Cornford was taught as a day boy in Cambridge, but at nine he was sent as a boarder to Copthorne Preparatory School in Sussex. Already he had developed an interest in military history, particularly in the campaigns of Napoleon. At fourteen he obtained a scholarship to Stowe School, which had existed for only six years. The first headmaster, J. F. Roxburgh, had been a pupil of Professor Cornford's at Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Cornford's individualism caused him to refuse to join the Officers' Training Corps. At fifteen he was writing poetry under the avant-garde influence of Robert Graves, T. S. Eliot, and particularly W. H. Auden, from whom he solicited a letter of encouragement. His political theories were being shaped by reading <span class="italic">Das Kapital</span> and the <span class="italic">Communist Manifesto</span>, and at sixteen he won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge. But, having outgrown Stowe and with time to kill before going up to Cambridge, he gravitated almost inevitably to the London School of Economics, where his active interest in politics began to overshadow his desire to be a poet. He joined the Young Communist League, and although he did attend lectures, he used his time in London to deepen his commitment to abolishing poverty by establishing communism in England. At this period Cornford had so separated politics from poetry that he even published a poem in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> under a pseudonym.<br>
<br>Cornford was still only seventeen when he entered Trinity in October 1933. During his three years at Cambridge he wrote only nine poems, for he was spending fourteen hours a day on political activities, and in March 1935 he became a full member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Despite his insistence on Marxian analysis and his exhausting programme of extra-curricular activities, he achieved first classes in both parts of the history tripos (1935 and 1936). He found time too to father an illegitimate child, shortly afterwards abandoning both the child and its mother, Ray Peters, for the woman he might well eventually have married, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39546/', "Margot Heinemann (d. 1992)")</script>. In 1936 Trinity gave him a scholarship, and he planned to study the Elizabethans, but when the Spanish Civil War broke out on 18 July 1936, on a sudden impulse and without even saying goodbye to his family, he left for Dieppe. By 8 August he was in Barcelona, unable to speak a word of Spanish but armed with a press card.<br>
<br>Cornford is said to have been the first Englishman to enlist in the International Brigades to fight against Franco. Some of his finest poetry was written on the Aragon front, in August and September 1936, including his most famous poem, &#145;Heart of the Heartless World&#146;. During his first period in Spain he fell seriously and mysteriously ill, and spent some time in hospital. During three weeks' leave in England, in late September and early October 1936, he resigned his Trinity scholarship and made a conscious decision to return to Spain for the duration of the war. He took part in the battle for Madrid, which began on 7 November 1936, and received a severe head wound. The battle near Lopera in which he was killed was a shambles, and the precise circumstances and date of his death are not known. He may have died on 27 December 1936, his twenty-first birthday, or the day after. His body was never recovered.<br>
<br>John Cornford's poems appeared in <span class="italic">New Writing</span>, the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Student Vanguard</span>, and they were collected in 1938 in <span class="italic">John Cornford: a Memoir</span>, edited by Pat Sloan. His best work has a direct simplicity, benefits from its autobiographical inspiration, and stands as a worthy memorial to all who died in the Spanish Civil War. Cornford himself came to be regarded as much as a typically doomed and respected idealist of his generation as a poet.<br>
