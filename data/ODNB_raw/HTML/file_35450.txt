<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peel,  Arthur Wellesley</span>, first Viscount Peel  (1829&#150;1912), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born in London on 3 August 1829, the youngest of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel, second baronet (1788&#150;1850)")</script>, prime minister, and his wife, Julia (1795&#150;1859), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9773/', "General Sir John Floyd, first baronet")</script>. He was named after his godfather, the first duke of Wellington. Among his brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21765/', "Sir Robert Peel, third baronet")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35451/', "Sir Frederick Peel")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21766/', "Sir William Peel")</script>. Peel figures as a boy in <span class="italic">The Private Letters of Sir Robert Peel</span> (1920). His early years were spent at the family home, Drayton Manor, Tamworth, and he was educated at Hatfield, Eton College (1841&#150;8), and Balliol College, Oxford, taking second-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1852. His education was thus a departure from the Harrow&#150;Christ Church tradition of the family.<br>
<br>In 1862 Peel married Adelaide (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of William Stratford Dugdale, of Merevale, Warwickshire, and his wife, Harriet Ella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Portman. They had four sons , including the soldier and financier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47815/', "Sir Sidney Cornwallis Peel")</script>, and three daughters. Peel followed his father politically, though they were not in personal terms particularly close, and Peel&#150;Gladstone politics defined his early career, though he was always more a Peelite than a Gladstonian. In 1863 he stood as a Liberal at a by-election in Coventry but was defeated. In 1865 he was returned as one of the two members for Warwick, splitting the two tory candidates. In 1868 he held the seat comfortably, and in 1874 and 1880 marginally. In 1885, when Warwick was joined to Leamington, Peel held the seat; unopposed as speaker in 1886 and 1892, he was then described as a Liberal Unionist.<br>
<br>In Gladstone's first ministry, Peel was parliamentary secretary to the poor-law board (1868&#150;71) and then, from 1871 to 1873, secretary to the Board of Trade. From 1873 to 1874 he was Liberal chief whip, with the awkward task of reviving the party after its disintegration on the Irish universities question. He resigned as chief whip following the Liberal Party's defeat in the general election of 1874 and played no significant part in the crusades and campaigns of the opposition years. On his return to the premiership in April 1880, Gladstone made Peel under-secretary at the Home Office, but ill health required his resignation in December 1880. Peel was uneasy about the government's Irish policy and voted against its <span class="roman">Crimes Bill</span> in July 1882. In 1883 H. B. W. Brand told Gladstone, as prime minister, of his intention to retire as speaker. Gladstone invited Sir Francis Herschell and then G. J. Goshen, both of whom declined the invitation. Gladstone then turned to Peel (like Brand a former Liberal chief whip) despite his ill health and on the rather curious ground that he had never known a speaker &#145;whose health gave way under the pressure of his duties&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 11.69). The Conservatives resented another former Liberal chief whip in the chair and on 26 February 1884 both Peel's nominators were Liberals (Northcote, as tory leader in the Commons, appearing to threaten opposition to Peel's subsequent re-election). He was elected unanimously, however, in 1884 (being also sworn of the privy council) and was re-elected unanimously on 12 January 1886, 5 August 1886, and 4 August 1892.<br>
<br>Despite the fact that he was hitherto well known for reticence in the Commons, Peel proved to be a formidable speaker, both physically and morally. He took office at a time of considerable animosity between the two main parties and held it during the years of Irish MPs' &#145;obstruction&#146;. Peel's chief achievement was to maintain the dignity of the house despite these difficulties. His opening statement as speaker produced a memorable effect and his stern discipline was felt impartially by all members. He:<blockquote>removed the Speaker's office to a lofty and impregnable isolation. His appearance accorded with his demeanour. He was tall and lean, his face grave and unsmiling, the nose sharp, the lips thin, the austerity of the countenance emphasised by an iron-grey beard. (Laundy, 323)</blockquote>On 13 January 1884 he cut through the muddle which Speaker Brand had allowed to develop with respect to Charles Bradlaugh's oath of allegiance, by simply allowing Bradlaugh to take the oath and ruling Sir Michael Hicks Beach out of order in his objections as having not yet himself taken the oath. Peel's stern demeanour may, of course, have provoked as well as quietened Irish MPs, but his moral effect was famously seen on the night of 27 July 1893 when during the committee stage of the second <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> a serious fight broke out on the floor of the house. The chairman of committees summoned the speaker, whose arrival in the house, like that of &#145;a parent, wise as well as fond&#146;, at once restored order.<br>
<br>The closure rule introduced in 1882 to speed the progress of government business depended on the speaker's initiative. Peel exercised it first on 24 February 1885, and again on 18 February 1887, after which the initiative was transferred from the speaker to the house, the speaker retaining, however, a veto on the introduction of the closure. Peel's willingness to allow the government to initiate closure was criticized on several occasions, and on 2 April 1887 Gladstone opposed what he saw as &#145;the mischievious Closure under the Speaker's authority&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 12.22). The new standing orders of 1888, providing for an automatic interruption of business at midnight, were less contentious than the closure but the exceptions to the rule placed a burden on the speaker. Peel's authority helped the house through this period of adjustment. <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted in its obituary: &#145;Theoretically Peel was the servant of the House. There were occasions when a stranger might almost have regarded him as its master&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Oct 1912).<br>
<br>Peel's wife died in 1890. In the autumn of 1894 he decided, for reasons of ill health, to retire as speaker. The Liberal government being in a minority, this posed problems for it and the retiral was several times delayed. At the end of February 1895 Peel declined to delay further, provoking a wrangle among the various candidates for his successor. On 4 April 1895 the cabinet agreed to the candidacy of W. C. Gully. Peel's resignation was announced on 8 April, leading to the first contest for the speakership since 1839. Peel was created Viscount Peel and accepted the speaker's pension.<br>
<br>Peel remained active in public life. He chaired the royal commission on the licensing laws (1896&#150;9), leading the minority on the commission in producing a minority report opposing the creation of a perpetual interest in a terminable licence and favouring the rapid reduction of licences by a compensation fund levied on the drink trade.<br>
<br>Peel was visitor of Balliol College (1894&#150;1912), chairman of the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery (1898&#150;1908), and an active trustee of the British Museum from 1898 until 1908. He was also president of the Temperance Legislation League, first chairman of the State Children's Aid Association, chairman of the council of Toynbee Hall, a governor of Harrow School, and vice-chairman of the Bedfordshire county council. He received the honorary DCL at Oxford in 1887. Peel died on 24 October 1912 at Sandy, Bedfordshire, where he had lived for many years. He was succeeded as second viscount by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35453/', "William Robert Wellesley Peel (1867&#150;1937)")</script>, also a politician.<br>
