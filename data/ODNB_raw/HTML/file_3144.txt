<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boys,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1571, <em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">dean of Canterbury</span>, was born at Elmton, in Eythorne, Kent, and baptized on 12 November 1571 at Eythorne, the sixth of ten children of Thomas Boys (1528&#150;1600) of Eythorne, gentleman, from a family established in east Kent since at least 1380, and his wife, Christian Searles (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter and coheir of John Searles of Wye. Boys entered the King's School, Canterbury, about 1581 and was admitted pensioner at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in April 1586. He graduated BA in 1590 and proceeded MA in 1593. That year he moved to Clare College, a migration apparently caused by his annoyance that a vacant Kentish fellowship at Corpus had been given instead to a native of Norfolk; he proceeded BD from Clare in 1600. In 1597 Boys was presented to the rectory of Betshanger in Kent through the influence of his uncle Sir John Boys (<i>d</i>. 1612), recorder of Canterbury, and in the same year Archbishop John Whitgift gave him the mastership of Eastbridge Hospital in Canterbury. Boys appears to have lived at Betshanger and to have begun to cultivate the art of preaching for, in addition to being presented by Whitgift with the further living of Tilmanstone in Kent in 1599, he preached at Paul's Cross for the first time that year and again on 8 February 1601, when his sermon coincided with a commotion in the cathedral caused by the attempted rebellion of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. In 1603 Boys was given a third Kent living, the rectory of Hollingbourne, and on 4 October the following year married Angela Bargrave (<i>d</i>. 1645), daughter of Robert Bargrave of Bridge, near Canterbury. There were no children.<br>
<br>Boys never lost sight of his debt to Cambridge. The foundation of his work was, he said, laid there: John Overall, then a fellow at Trinity College, had taken a special interest in him and the university nurtured his interest in the pulpit. Boys's anonymous eulogist heard him say that &#145;he never missed publique Sermon at St Maries, during all the time of his abode there, save twice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remaines</span>, sig. b). He preached in Latin at the university church in 1599 and again in 1605 when he received the degree of DD. Soon afterwards Boys began the project that was to bring him renown and, eventually, preferment&#151;a systematic exposition, through printed sermons, of the church's prescribed lectionary. It was a project well suited to the protestant milieu being developed at Canterbury by Thomas Neville, dean from 1597 to 1615, and it occupied Boys for the next decade. During this time he took &#145;paines in preaching every weeke, if not at his owne charge, yet there where was more need&#146;  (ibid., sig. a3) and the result was eleven books of &#145;postils&#146; published between 1609 and 1617. Such was the popularity of his volumes that sales were large and rapid. Further impressions were soon required and twelve separate reissues have survived for the period from 1610 to 1616.<br>
<br>By 1610 Boys's influence was being felt at Canterbury, where Neville reviewed the preaching obligations of the cathedral clergy and instituted a rota of liturgically based expository sermons. Nevertheless, the progress of Boys's career was slow. According to contemporaries his lack of advancement was because &#145;a great prelate in the church&#146; bore him ill will &#145;for mutual animosities betwixt them, whilst gremials in the university&#146;  (Fuller, 2.155). Boys preached at Ashford during the primary visitation of Archbishop Richard Bancroft in September 1607, but his only preferment during Bancroft's tenure at Canterbury was his appointment by James I in 1610 as one of seventeen founding fellows of the ill-fated King's College, Chelsea, where, under the provostship of Matthew Sutcliffe, the fellows' task was to counter the controversial literature of Catholic writers. One fruit of this work was Boys's sermon at Paul's Cross on the anniversary in 1613 of the Gunpowder Plot (5 November), in which he also commended the lottery set up in 1612 to help refinance the Virginia Company.<br>
<br>With the succession of George Abbott to Canterbury, Boys's work to promote a preaching ministry found an enthusiastic patron and finally secured him preferment. In 1618, upon resigning the vicarage at Tilmanstone, he was awarded the rectory of Great Monaghan and in May 1619 the deanery at Canterbury. In 1620 he was made a member of the court of high commission, in 1622 he collected together his books and five miscellaneous sermons, publishing them as his <span class="italic">Workes</span>, and in 1624 he sat in the convocation at London on behalf of the clergy in his diocese. Boys presided over a significant expansion of the cathedral's musical life which, he maintained, much aided the due observance of the prayer book. In his time at Canterbury the cathedral also retained the strongly protestant tenor that Neville had inaugurated, centred on the pulpit: to this Boys brought the predestinarian Calvinism typical of the late Elizabethan and Jacobean church. The subsequent choice as dean in succession to Boys of his brother-in-law, the conservative Isaac Bargrave, signalled a move in the direction of Laudianism.<br>
<br>Boys probably had independent means. He appears to have inherited his father's house and he was able to maintain a spacious household in his official residence at Chartham, where he refurbished the fabric. Three months after preaching before Charles I at Canterbury Boys died in his study at Elmton in Eythorne on 26 September 1625; he was buried in the cathedral four days later. Six years after his death fifteen further sermons were published as the <span class="italic">Remaines of &hellip; John Boys</span>, &#145;that reverend and famous postiller&#146;. Boys's widow, Dean Bargrave's sister, erected a monument to her husband, possibly by Nicholas Stone and now considered &#145;an outstanding example of the discovery of the surface quality of marble&#146;  (Collinson and others, 522); it depicts Boys standing in his library. In 1631 Boys's eulogist maintained that &#145;there were in his time, and yet are few soules &hellip; that taste not of his books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remaines</span>, sig. a) and he was, it seems, one of the great book collectors of his time, quoting liberally in his published work from an exceptionally wide range of contemporary literature, including Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Boys's writings were translated into German and published in Strasbourg in 1683 and 1685; an edition appeared in Philadelphia in 1849. The continuing appeal and convenience to clergy of Boys's exposition of the Anglican lectionary is attested to by C. H. Spurgeon in his <span class="italic">Commentating and Commentaries</span> (1876), while in 1906 Charles Higham, a prominent theological bookseller in London, reported a continuing &#145;steady demand&#146; for Boys's <span class="italic">Workes</span>, &#145;which is still much used by clergy&#146;  (priv. coll.).<br>
