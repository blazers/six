<span class="headword">Richardson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Odle]</span>,  Dorothy Miller</span>  (1873&#150;1957), <span class="occ">novelist and journalist</span>, was born on 17 May 1873 at Albert Park, Abingdon, Berkshire, the third of the four daughters of Charles Richardson (1836&#150;1915), grocer and tradesman, of Abingdon, and his wife, Mary Miller (1843&#150;1895), daughter of Edward Taylor, manufacturer, of East Coker, Somerset. She attended schools in Abingdon and in Worthing, Sussex, where the family settled in 1880. In 1883 the Richardsons moved to Putney, London. There Dorothy was educated first by a governess and then in the intellectually stimulating environment of Southborough House, which provided the only formal education she valued in retrospect.<br>
<br>Charles Richardson's aspirations to rise socially and live the life of an intellectual gentleman, combined with his unwise investments, led the family into bankruptcy. Dorothy thus had to start earning her own living when she was seventeen. In 1891 she taught at a finishing school in Hanover, Germany, for six months. After her return to England she taught at a school in Finsbury Park, Middlesex. She considered teaching to be an unduly confining experience and resigned her subsequent post as a governess in 1895 in order to look after her mother, who suffered from severe depression. Her parents, who had been forced to sell their house in London, had moved to Chiswick in 1893, and Mary Richardson's ordeal came to a tragic end when she committed suicide during a stay in Hastings with her daughter Dorothy in November 1895.<br>
<br>In 1896 Richardson moved to Bloomsbury and earned a meagre living as an assistant to a Harley Street dentist. In London she showed an interest in a wide range of political, feminist, philosophical, and religious avant-garde movements of her time. She was a close friend of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36831/', "H. G. Wells (1866&#150;1946)")</script>, who, among others, encouraged her to write. She had a brief affair with him, became pregnant, miscarried, and subsequently suffered a breakdown in 1907. As a result of these events, she gave up her job, spent the following winter in Switzerland, and then lived on a farm in Sussex for several years. There she felt attracted to Quakerism, which became the topic of her first two books, <span class="italic">The Quakers Past and Present</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">Gleanings from the Works of George Fox</span> (1914). From 1907 she devoted herself to a journalistic career, publishing periodical articles on topics which ranged from literature and politics to dentistry, as well as reviews, sketches, short stories, and poems. She also engaged in translation work from German and French originals. In 1912 she began to write fiction while staying in Cornwall with friends. Twelve books of her best-known work, <span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, were published between 1915 and 1938; the first collected edition of all thirteen volumes of this novel, comprising <span class="italic">Pointed Roofs</span> (1915), <span class="italic">Backwater</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Honeycomb</span> (1917), <span class="italic">The Tunnel</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Interim</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Deadlock</span> (1921), <span class="italic">Revolving Lights</span> (1923), <span class="italic">The Trap</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Oberland</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Dawn's Left Hand</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Clear Horizon</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Dimple Hill</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">March Moonlight</span> (1967), appeared posthumously in 1967.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span> Richardson provided an impressionistic account of the experiences of the central character, Miriam Henderson, which are modelled on the author's own migratory life between 1891 and 1915. Her writing technique is experimental and has frequently been compared to James Joyce's and Virginia Woolf's style. Richardson believed that reality in the early twentieth century could no longer be captured by imposing a plot through conventional narrative devices. Instead she immersed herself in Miriam's multilayered consciousness and narrated everything through the mind of her heroine. In doing so she frequently sacrificed conventional form and selectivity, which she considered to be characteristics of male writing. She attempted to portray life as continually fluctuating, blurred, and opaque, as well as an open-ended and timeless experience without fixed meanings. What is more, she considered her technique to be a specifically female way of writing. In her foreword to the 1938 edition of <span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span> she pointed out that feminine prose should be &#145;unpunctuated, moving from point to point without formal obstructions&#146;, and Virginia Woolf claimed that Richardson had invented &#145;the psychological sentence of the feminine gender&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>). In a review of <span class="italic">Pointed Roofs</span>, which was published in <span class="italic">The Egoist</span> in April 1918, May Sinclair first applied the term &#145;stream of consciousness&#146; to literature in her discussion of Richardson's stylistic innovations. Even though Richardson despised Sinclair's term, it is today closely associated with her writing.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1917 Richardson married the artist Alan Odle (1888&#150;1948), son of Samuel Odle, a bank clerk. Her husband was fifteen years younger than she and had consumption, and she looked after him until his death in 1948. Between 1917 and 1939, when the Odles had to give up their rooms in Queen's Terrace, St John's Wood, the couple lived alternately in London and Cornwall. After 1939 they settled in Cornwall, and Richardson remained there after her husband's death. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1954 Dorothy Richardson moved to a nursing home at 131 Albemarle Road, Beckenham, Kent, where she died on 17 June 1957. In accordance with her wishes her body was donated to medicine, and over two years after her death was interred at the Streatham Park cemetery, London.<br>
