<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pertwee,  Jon Devon Roland</span>  (1919&#150;1996), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 7 July 1919 at 3 Sheffield Terrace, Kensington, London. He was the second son of the playwright, painter, and actor Roland Pertwee and his actress wife, Avice Scholtz. His parents separated when he was still an infant, and he and his brother Michael were brought up by their paternal grandmother.<br>
<br>He had a chequered school career, being expelled from his preparatory school and from Sherborne School before attending the progressive school Frensham Heights and finally the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where the principal considered him without talent. In 1936 Pertwee secured a place in the final tour of the Arts League of Service Travelling Theatre, directed by Donald Wolfit. In 1937 he joined J. Baxter-Somerville's Repertory Players at the Springfield Theatre in Jersey, and then toured with the Rex Lesley-Smith repertory company for a year before returning to London. During 1938 and 1939 Pertwee obtained several small parts in theatre before the actor John Salew gave him a break into commercial radio, where he stayed for the next two years. To supplement his income, he also worked as an extra at Denham film studios, appearing in productions including <span class="italic">Dinner at the Ritz</span> (1936), <span class="italic">A Yank at Oxford</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Young Man's Fancy</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Four Just Men</span> (1939).<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out Pertwee joined the navy as a wireless operator. On 29 November 1940 he was drafted on to <i>HMS Hood</i>, but he was transferred to the <i>Dunluce Castle</i> to train as an officer cadet just before <i>HMS Hood</i> had its fateful battle with the <i>Bismarck</i> on 24 May 1941. Following an incendiary bomb attack on Portsmouth barracks, he suffered a severe blow to the head and was dropped from the officer cadet course to be posted to the Isle of Man as a divisional officer. There he formed a small company of local amateurs and servicemen which became known as the Service Players. In 1946 Pertwee joined the cast of Eric Barker's forces radio show <span class="italic">Mediterranean Merry-Go-Round</span>, and in 1948 the fictional <i>HMS Waterlogged</i> became the subject of a spin-off show entitled <span class="italic">Waterlogged Spa</span>, for which Pertwee created a memorable radio character, the Postman, with the catch-phrase &#145;What does it matter what you do as long as you tear 'em up?&#146;<br>
<br>Pertwee received star billing for a film for the first time in 1953, with George Cole in <span class="italic">Will any Gentleman &hellip;?</span>, filming which he met the actress Jean (Jeann Lindsey Torren) Marsh (<i>b</i>. 1934). They were married on 2 April 1955, but the marriage quickly broke down. It was on a skiing holiday in Kitzb&uuml;hel in February 1958 that Pertwee met Ingeborg Renate Rh&ouml;sa (<i>b</i>. 1934/5), a young German dress designer, and immediately fell in love. Pertwee was divorced from Marsh in 1960 and married Ingeborg on 13 August the same year. They had two children, who both became actors. In 1958 Pertwee was asked by the BBC's head of light entertainment if he had any ideas for a new radio comedy series in which he might be interested in starring. Out of these discussions came <span class="italic">The Navy Lark</span>, a show which ran for eighteen years and 240 episodes, and took full advantage of Pertwee's range of funny voices.<br>
<br>During the sixties Pertwee continued working in film, including three of the popular <span class="italic">Carry on</span> films: <span class="italic">Carry on Cleo</span> (1964), <span class="italic">Carry on Cowboy</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">Carry on Screaming</span> (1966). He also enjoyed successful stage tours in <span class="italic">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</span> (1963&#150;6) and <span class="italic">There's a Girl in my Soup</span> (1966&#150;7).<br>
<br>In 1969 Pertwee succeeded Patrick Troughton as the star of the long-running BBC science fiction series <span class="italic">Doctor Who</span>. Following William Hartnell's original creation of the Doctor as a crotchety old man and Troughton's humorous, somewhat fey interpretation, Pertwee played the Doctor rather more straight, as a flamboyant man of action complete with Edwardian roadster and clothes to match. This Doctor, earthbound by sentence of the Time Lords, confronted and defeated a weekly array of hostile aliens in the English countryside and metropolis, with the help of a team of United Nations soldiers and a girl assistant. The show frequently attracted audiences of over eight million viewers, and for a whole generation Pertwee was simply &#145;the Doctor&#146;. He stayed with the show for five seasons, his character physically regenerating in 1974 into the irrepressible Tom Baker. After leaving <span class="italic">Doctor Who</span>, Pertwee for five years hosted the successful quiz <span class="italic">Whodunnit?</span> for Thames Television and appeared in the film <span class="italic">One of our Dinosaurs is Missing</span> (1975). In 1976&#150;7 he returned to the theatre in the musical <span class="italic">Irene</span>. In 1979 he was cast as the scarecrow Worzel Gummidge in Southern Television's series of that name, and he played the part with a fruity Devonian accent for four seasons. It won him another loyal audience of young children, both in Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>Pertwee continued to work on stage, appearing as Jacob Marley in <span class="italic">Scrooge&#151;the Musical</span> in 1991&#150;2. He returned to the role of the Doctor for several Doctor Who stories and appeared in other television programmes including <span class="italic">Young Indiana Jones</span> (1994). He provided character voices for a computer game based on Terry Pratchett's <span class="italic">Discworld</span> in 1995.<br>
<br>Pertwee was in constant demand for appearances at science fiction conventions and in cabaret, for after-dinner speaking, and for guest appearances on television and radio and for charity: he was ever ready to don the costumes of the parts which had brought him celebrity, to please the fans and raise funds. In the early part of 1996 he was touring in two different productions, one an evening of music and comedy, the other his popular one-man show <span class="italic">Who is Jon Pertwee?</span> Throughout his career of more than five decades, Pertwee was a staunch supporter of and fund-raiser for the Grand Order of Water Rats, a charity caring for elderly and retired members of the acting profession.<br>
<br>Jon Pertwee died in his sleep on 20 May 1996 from a heart attack while on holiday in Connecticut, USA, weeks after completing work on his second volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">I am the Doctor</span> (1996). He was cremated at Putney Vale crematorium.<br>
