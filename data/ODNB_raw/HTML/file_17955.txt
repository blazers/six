<span class="headword">Manners,  Henry</span>, second earl of Rutland  (1526&#150;1563), <span class="occ">courtier and soldier</span>, was born on 23 September 1526 and baptized after 24 December at Elsinges Manor, Enfield, Middlesex, the eldest son of five sons and six daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17963/', "Thomas Manners, first earl of Rutland (c.1497&#150;1543)")</script>, and his second wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1551), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21515/', "Sir William Paston (1479?&#150;1554)")</script> and Bridget Heydon. During his father's lifetime he was styled Lord Ros. At a triple wedding on 3 July 1536, when the other bridegrooms were the heirs of the earls of Oxford and Westmorland, he married Lady Margaret Neville (<i>c</i>.1525&#150;1559), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19953/', "Ralph Neville, fourth earl of Westmorland (1498&#150;1549)")</script>, and Lady Catherine Stafford. Given their youth, the couple are unlikely to have lived together for some years. Details of Ros's education are unknown; he does not seem to have attended Oxford or Cambridge universities. By summer 1540 he was in residence at Croxton Abbey, Leicestershire. The elder of his two sons with Margaret, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17952/', "Edward Manners")</script>, was not born until July 1549; the couple also had a daughter. <br>
<br>Following the death of his father on 20 September 1543, he succeeded as second earl of Rutland, and with his uncle Sir Richard Manners, the family leader until he came of age, he was involved in the invasion of France in 1544. He was knighted by Henry VIII at the surrender of Boulogne on 30 September, and in 1546 accompanied the town's governor, John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, and the lord admiral, Sir Thomas Seymour, on an embassy to France. Rutland bore the spurs at the coronation of Edward VI on 20 February 1547. That year he became constable of Nottingham Castle and warden and chief justice in eyre of Sherwood Forest, and began to emerge as the leading magnate in Nottinghamshire. At about this time much of his debt to the crown was forgiven. <br>
<br>After the arrest of the lord admiral in January 1549, Rutland testified that Lord Seymour had actively sought his support in intrigues against his brother the lord protector, Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset. On 1 May Rutland was appointed warden of the east and middle marches on the Scottish borders in succession to Lord Grey of Wilton. In view of his youth and inexperience Sir Thomas Holcroft and others were deputed to advise him, but he &#145;emerged from his baptism of fire with high credit&#146;  (Merriman, 373). Having marched in June to Stichill, near Hume, he drove the French from Jedburgh, recaptured Ferniehirst Tower, and engaged in targeted devastation. In command during the evacuation of Haddington in September, he then accumulated plans of all the key strongholds still in English hands; these survive and constitute important evidence of English activity there from 1547. He went with William Parr, marquess of Northampton, on his mission to France in May 1551. He became joint lord lieutenant of Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire with Lord Admiral Clinton in April that year, but sole lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire only in May 1552. <br>
<br>Rutland associated with extreme reformers. He attended a debate about transubstantiation at Sir Richard Morison's house. In February 1551 he testified against Sir Richard Whalley, who was involved in a bizarre attempt to return Somerset to power. In April Rutland joined a group of thirteen noblemen, each entrusted with a band of men-at-arms. John Dudley, now earl of Warwick, experimented with this virtual standing army financed by the crown and manned by trusted noblemen, who recruited their servants. In December Rutland sat on the commission which tried the earl of Somerset. He strongly supported Dudley, now duke of Northumberland, during the Lady Jane Grey affair. By 29 July 1553 he was in the custody of a knight marshal and on 31 July he was sent to the Fleet prison, apparently still adhering &#145;to Northumberland with the utmost obstinacy&#146;  (R. Wingfield, &#145;Vita Maria Anglicanae regina&#146;, ed. D. MacCulloch, <span class="italic">Camden Miscellany</span>, 28, CS, 4th ser., 29, 1984, 270). <br>
<br>However, Rutland came to terms with Mary's regime. Released to house arrest on 8 September, he was then pardoned. In 1554 he was one of sixteen members of the &eacute;lite entrusted with a band of men-at-arms. In 1557 he was appointed captain-general of horsemen, and then lieutenant- and captain-general of the ill-fated army and navy that set out to retain Calais in January 1558. During Mary's reign he finished his father's work of rebuilding the family seat, Belvoir Castle. <br>
<br>Rutland gained immediate favour under Elizabeth. He was commissioned to investigate the affairs of the late Cardinal Reginald Pole and was installed as a knight of the Garter on 3 June 1559. That year he was appointed lord lieutenant in Nottinghamshire and Rutland, where he mustered troops against the threat of a French invasion. On 13 October his wife died at Holywell, Shoreditch, London; she was buried on 21 October at the parish church of St Leonard. Early the following year Rutland married Bridget (1525/6&#150;1601), widow of the diplomat Sir Richard Morison (<i>c</i>.1510&#150;1556) and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14266/', "John Hussey, Lord Hussey (1465/6&#150;1537)")</script>, and Lady Anne Grey. On 20 January 1561 he became president of the council of the north. He travelled north in February and immediately began a refurbishment of the king's manor house at York, which became the council's meeting place. Having been commissioned to inquire into offences against the <span class="roman">Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy in the province of York</span>, he noted as early as 25 February in a letter to William Cecil that &#145;I do not finde the country so forward in religion as I wish it to be&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 59/4, no. 1026). Although he was able to muster troops for the French campaign of 1562&#150;3, the brevity of his tenure of office curtailed his achievements. He died on 17 September 1563 in time of plague (though it is unclear whether he was a direct victim) and was buried in the parish church at Bottesford, Leicestershire, where a fine alabaster monument to him and his first wife was erected. Owing to a dispute over ancestral lands, his will dated 5 July 1560 was never proved. A crown survey lists his per annum income at &pound;2485, though his debts had been accumulating; early death kept him from reaping substantial profits under Elizabeth. He was succeeded as third earl of Rutland by his son Edward. His widow, Countess Bridget, married about June 1566 Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford; she died on 12 January 1601.<br>
