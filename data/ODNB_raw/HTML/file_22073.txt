<span class="headword">Pettyt,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1556), <span class="occ">surveyor and military engineer</span>, is of unknown origins; all that is known of his family is that an Edmund Pettyt who was at Calais while Thomas was surveyor there may well have been related. Thomas appears first in 1542 &#145;riding to Barwike about the King's affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 17, no. 482), and the next year was sent north again to inspect the conditions of Wark Castle at a time when Anglo-Scottish conflict threatened: probably he also resumed work on the defences of Berwick. He then appears to have accompanied the English army in its drive north in 1544 and 1545, when he was required to report on the potential of Ross Castle on the Isle of Bute to control Scotland's western approaches. In autumn 1545, however, he was in Calais, drawing up a map of the English holdings around the city, completed and signed in October. Early the next year he was appointed surveyor of Calais, a post he held until his death.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1547 Pettyt was dispatched north again to survey and examine various fortified or fortifiable sites in the west marches of Scotland, and subsequently to advise on the further improvement of the defences of Berwick. It seems that he was not the official architect or consultant but rather the on-site manager; in this role he ensured that instructions from the principal engineers were carried out despite the shortage of money and manpower and the difficulty of the ground, all of which figure in his reports. In this capacity and as surveyor he was to remain in the borders or in Scotland during the English invasions.<br>
<br>When required to advise on a suitable site for an inland fort to protect English lines of communication, Pettyt proposed Lauder, and spent some months there in 1548. Although he did not stay long enough to complete the work, it was at least in an advanced state at his departure in June. This seems to be the only case where he supplied the design as well as organizing building operations, although it is possible that he was involved in fortifying Eyemouth. His structure at Lauder is now largely buried under later buildings, but a plan drawn up shortly after he left suggests that he had absorbed well the ideas of Italian engineers and the leading English engineers who were adopting their principles, notably in the modern form of the bastions. Merriman comments that the design shows &#145;sophistication and eccentricity&#146;  (Merriman and Summerson, 4.715). Lord Grey, the English commander, claimed that the whole Scottish army would not be able to capture such a strong fortress, whatever foreign aid they might have. His report was apparently accompanied by Pettyt's own plan, which has not survived.<br>
<br>In July Pettyt accompanied an English force that set out to reinforce Haddington, then besieged by the joint Franco-Scottish army. Finding the allied forces had given up the siege for the time being, and were retreating, the English sought to harass them; the allies then turned on them, pursuing them for several miles. Pettyt was among those captured, and wrote from prison in Edinburgh, to ask for an exchange. After his release he remained on the borders until almost the end of 1549. A substantial bonus was awarded him for his services over the two years. Once the English army had evacuated Haddington late in that year, Lauder was an obvious target. The allies were preparing to besiege it when, by the terms of peace signed at Boulogne in 1550, the whole area had to be returned to Scottish control; the fortress was abandoned and apparently dismantled.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Pettyt had returned to Calais, where he remained for the rest of his life apart from official visits to London. He was given instructions for improving the defences of Calais and outlying strongholds, including the replacement of a rounded bastion by one apparently more Italianate. These instructions were sufficiently important for Pettyt to have to report directly to Somerset, the lord protector, and even to be recorded in some detail in Edward VI's own chronicle for 1550. In such cases it is never clear how far these instructions may not have been his own recommendations, which he laid before the council, who then ordered him to carry them out; and how far he simply had to report on the state of particular structures, and then act on plans laid down by his superiors. Another map of Calais and the surroundings dating from this time is probably also by him. A few later references in 1552&#150;3 mention his work as surveyor, carrying out various improvements to the fortifications, notably at the outlying stronghold of Gu&icirc;nes, but he died before December 1556, when John Rogers was appointed in his place. As Rogers was to be paid &#145;from the tyme of Petyte's death&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1555&#150;7</i>, 527), and to have the same house for his residence, Pettyt's death must have been quite recent.<br>
<br>Pettyt's role as surveyor evidently included inspection and overseeing construction and repair of fortifications. Except at Lauder, however, he was a manager and supervisor rather than original designer. His two maps of the Calais territory of 1545 and <i>c</i>.1550 are in the British Library (Cotton MS Augustus I.ii.57B and Cotton MS Augustus I.ii.71 respectively). Plans and maps he made in Scotland are lost, although a plan of Lauder is now at Belvoir Castle.<br>
