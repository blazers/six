<span class="headword">Evans,  John Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1798), <span class="occ">explorer</span>, was born in the farmhouse of Gwredog Uchaf in Caernarvonshire, the son of Thomas Evans (<i>d</i>. 1788) and his wife, Anne. Baptized on 14 April 1770, he was the product of a pious home. His father, a farmer, gained some distinction as an itinerant preacher and was one of the first Methodists in Caernarvonshire. After attending the village school Evans had established himself in London by the spring of 1792. He believed, with others, in the story of the pre-Columbian discovery of America by a twelfth-century Welsh prince, Madoc, and his mythical descendants, the white-skinned, Welsh-speaking Padoucas. This persistent legend was revitalized by the Nootka Sound crisis of 1790, which gave old legends of a British prior claim to America contemporary political relevance. The Padoucas were identified with a real people, the Mandans, on the upper reaches of the Missouri. Iolo Morganwg resolved to find them. In May 1792 it was mentioned for the first time that Iolo would be accompanied by Evans. Although Iolo fell desperately ill, Evans was undeterred: he borrowed money for his steerage passage and reached Baltimore in October.<br>
<br>Evans walked to the home of the influential Welsh-American Baptist the Revd Samuel Jones in Philadelphia to seek advice. Back in Baltimore, he became a merchant's clerk and spent the winter of 1792 there, whence he wrote: &#145;Either Death or Liberty &hellip; so it is with me, either the Madogion or death&#146;  (J. Evans to E. Williams, 22 Nov 1792, NL Wales, 13222). In February 1793 he consulted Samuel Jones for a second time, who tried to dissuade him, but without success. He left Philadelphia in March and in May reached New Madrid in Spanish Louisiana. He set out for the Illinois, and for eighteen months after his arrival dropped out of sight. It seems likely that a frontier merchant found employment for him as a surveyor or general agent. He became embroiled in the imperialist and trading tensions of the frontier, and was imprisoned by the Spanish as a British spy for two days in St Louis. The US supreme justice in the Northwest Territory interceded and effected an introduction for him to the Spanish governor. The Spanish realized that even if he failed to find the Welsh Indians, he might find a great deal more.<br>
<br>Evans had already met the experienced explorer James Mackay, who was to be the leader of a full-scale Spanish scientific expedition. Mackay and Evans set out in mid-August 1795 aiming to reach the Pacific for Spain. By November they were in Omaha territory, where they wintered. Early in 1796 Evans and a detachment set out to find the Mandans. Mackay supplied him with detailed charts and instructions. For over six months Evans lived among the Mandans and held them to their Spanish allegiance. The Missouri Company unravelled behind him and in May 1797, facing pressure from the British Northwest Company, he had to leave. On 15 July he reported to Samuel Jones from St Louis that &#145;there is no such people as the Welsh Indians&#146;  (Williams, &#145;Mission to the Madogwys&#146;, 600&#150;01), although the letter was not in his usual style, and may have been censored by the Spanish. The report was published in the American and then the Welsh press. Through the winter of 1797&#150;8 Evans was a surveyor in upper Louisiana, in the employ of Americans. His months on the Missouri had undermined his health; without pay, he returned to St Louis. Suffering from nervous depression, Evans began to drink heavily. He moved into the household of the enigmatic Spanish empire builder Jacques Clamorgan, and went down to New Orleans on his behalf to secure assistance for another expedition. The governor of New Orleans observed that the strength of liquor had deranged his senses. Evans died in poverty in New Orleans in June or July 1798.<br>
<br>According to an oral tradition, Evans claimed while drinking that he knew more about the Welsh Indians than anyone would ever know, but that he had been paid to keep his mouth shut. A more concrete legacy was the striking resemblance between the instructions drawn up for a later explorer, Meriwether Lewis, and those which James Mackay drew for John Evans's visit to the Mandans in 1796.<br>
