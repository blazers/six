<span class="headword">Vulliamy family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1730&#150;1886), <span class="occ">clock- and watchmakers</span>, was founded in London by <a name="cosubject_50602"></a><span class="headword">(Fran&ccedil;ois) Justin Vulliamy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1712, <em>d.</em> 1797), a Swiss <span class="occ">watchmaker</span>, son of a pastor at Gingins in the Pays de Vaud, who moved to London in the 1730s to study English watchmaking, particularly, it is believed, the cylinder escapement recently developed by George Graham. By the late 1730s Justin was associated with <a name="cosubject_50601"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Gray</span>  (1676/7&#150;1764), a leading <span class="occ">watchmaker</span>, it is believed, in St James's Street, who was noted for making fine repeating watches and pedometers. On 12 July 1741, Vulliamy married Gray's daughter Mary (1707&#150;1783); they had four children, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1743), Benjamin (1747&#150;1811), Lewis (1749&#150;1822), and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1750).<br>
<br>In 1742 Gray was appointed watchmaker in ordinary to George II and Vulliamy, who became Gray's partner at about this time, was closely associated with these duties, though there is no evidence that he himself ever held the royal warrant. In 1752, the business moved to 75 (later renumbered 68) Pall Mall, where it remained for the next hundred years. The partnership continued to produce the high quality watches which had made Gray's reputation, as well as a number of clocks, chiefly of conventional type but including an advanced regulator using John Harrison's &#145;grasshopper&#146; escapement, which was given to the Society of Antiquaries by Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy in 1848.<br>
<br>After Gray's death on 1 February 1764 Vulliamy continued to produce expensive watches for his fashionable clients as well as cheaper watches to be sold under fictitious names, as his successors were to do. He also made clocks and a number of fine barometers. Although Vulliamy was not as concerned with the search for greater precision in timekeeping as some of his contemporaries, his reputation was sufficiently high for the board of longitude to select him as possible replacement for one of the three watchmakers asked to assess Harrison's revolutionary marine timekeeper H4 in 1765. Gray had lost his royal warrant to George Lindsay on the accession of George III in 1760, but Vulliamy was able to maintain close connections with the horologically minded new king, supplying him with a regulator and a &#145;follower&#146; clock for timing astronomical observations for the private observatory which the king built at Kew to observe the transit of Venus in 1769. Vulliamy and his elder son, Benjamin, assisted with these observations.<br>
<br>The 1760s also saw Justin Vulliamy increasingly active outside the business. In 1762 he took a leading role in founding the &Eacute;glise Helv&eacute;tique, or Swiss protestant church, in London, becoming president of its <i>consistoire</i> or governing body; in 1766, with other Swiss &eacute;migr&eacute;s, he helped to found a French-speaking lodge of freemasons. Such social activities strengthened Vulliamy's connections within London's large French-speaking community of expatriate merchants and craftsmen, connections which were further reinforced by the apprenticeship of his younger son, Lewis, to the Huguenot merchant John Daniel Lucadou in 1764. Lewis was later to marry one of Lucadou's daughters and this, like the marriage in 1779 of Justin's elder son Benjamin to Sarah de Gingins (1758&#150;1841), natural daughter and heir to the English property of a Swiss officer formerly in the East India Company's service, placed the Vulliamys firmly within the more prosperous ranks of this expatriate community. Justin Vulliamy's wife, Mary, died in 1783 and he died at Kensington on 1 December 1797, leaving his share of the business to his elder son and partner, Benjamin.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50603"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Vulliamy</span>  (1747&#150;1811)<span class="occ"></span> had assumed the daily running of the firm many years earlier, possibly in the late 1770s. He was born in St James's on 27 August 1747 and trained in the family business. It is not certain when he became a full partner but he was appointed clockmaker to the king (a post distinct from that of watchmaker, held by his grandfather) as early as 1772. He further developed the firm's contacts with the court, the evident competence of his work allowing him to survive a major reduction in civil list posts in 1782, subject to agreeing to look after the crown's turret clocks&#151;a condition which, under his successor, was to lead to the firm's involvement in turret clock design and construction. However, Benjamin's own horological interests lay in other directions. The market for astronomical clocks such as those made by the Vulliamys for the king was clearly limited. On the other hand, their core business of high quality watches was increasingly threatened by illegal imports of cheaper foreign watches. Attempts at control by the Clockmakers' Company, stimulated by Vulliamy and other leading watchmakers who became honorary freemen in 1781 for this purpose, proved ineffective. Benjamin therefore decided to move into the market for expensive, ornamental, clocks, hitherto dominated by French makers. Not only did this fit the firm's existing clientele but it also suited Benjamin's own artistic tastes (shown as early as 1758 when, as a child, he had won a prize for drawing from the Society of Arts). During the 1780s he began to produce a series of clocks in the latest neo-classical style which were to establish the firm as the leading British producer of ornamental clocks. This expanded during the 1790s into the production of ornamental objects in ormolu, bronze, and marble, such as candelabra and chimney pieces. Under the patronage of wealthy connoisseurs like the prince of Wales and stimulated by the wars which made French luxury products more difficult to obtain, the supply of such <i>objets d'art</i> became, for a time, more important to the Vulliamys than their traditional business of clock- and watchmaking. Unfortunately, this concentration on very expensive luxury articles made the firm vulnerable to delays in payment by its major customers. By 1807 Benjamin Vulliamy was having to borrow money to sustain the business and his problems were compounded by the collapse of his bankers, Devaynes &amp; Co., in 1810. The confusion in his financial affairs was unresolved at his death in 1811, preventing a proper settlement of his personal estate.<br>
<br>Given these problems in his final years, it is not surprising that Benjamin's second son, Justin Theodore, should later describe him as &#145;too much a gentleman to make a good tradesman&#146;, a judgement which may appear to fit the rather refined figure shown in the portrait of Benjamin Vulliamy owned by the Clockmakers' Company, but which is misleading if applied to the earlier stages of his career. Nearer the truth was Justin Theodore's further comment that his father had been a &#145;clever, unsociable man&#146;. Although Benjamin succeeded his father as president of the Swiss church in London, he was certainly less active in the institutions with which he was associated than either his father or his sons, and seems to have been an essentially private man. Nevertheless, he possessed an enquiring mind and was acquainted with scientific and industrial leaders like Sir Joseph Banks and Matthew Boulton. His inventiveness led him in such varied directions as patenting improved methods of harnessing and suspending two-wheeled carriages in 1792; and sinking what is said to have been the first artesian well in Britain in 1794, an achievement which he reported to the Royal Society in 1797. The well was on the Norland estate in Kensington, which he had bought with his brother, Lewis, in 1792. Originally Benjamin had the farm while Lewis, a prosperous sugar refiner, occupied the main house and its extensive grounds. However, Benjamin later reunited the estate (valued at &pound;13,000 in 1806), and Norland House became his main home from about 1800 until his death in 1811. This, combined with bouts of ill health, meant that the running of the Pall Mall business was increasingly entrusted to Benjamin's eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_28357">Benjamin Lewis [<i>see below</i>]</a>, assisted by his second son, <a href="#cosubject_50604">Justin Theodore [<i>see below</i>]</a>, though Benjamin undoubtedly retained an active interest and must take much of the responsibility for the difficulties which the business experienced in these years.<br>
<br>In spite of his financial problems, the business which Benjamin left to his successors on his death on Christmas day 1811 was much larger than under his predecessors, with net profits approaching &pound;1900 per year. He also left property in stocks and land worth about &pound;30,000. In default of a comprehensive will, the main beneficiary was Benjamin Lewis, who inherited the whole of the Norland estate (which was soon let), as well as a share of his father's personal wealth. He also took control of the business, with Justin Theodore as junior partner. Benjamin and Sarah's other surviving children&#151;Mary (<i>b</i>. 1781), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28359/', "Lewis Vulliamy (1791&#150;1871)")</script>, Frances (<i>b</i>. 1801), and Frederick (1803&#150;1892)&#151;fared relatively badly in the disposition of their father's estate and this led to protracted legal disputes within the family which were not finally concluded until after Benjamin Lewis's death in 1854. None of these younger children joined the family business: Lewis became a successful architect and Frederick entered a bank, while Mary married first a naval captain, C. W. Boys RN (<i>d</i>. 1809), and subsequently a barrister, W. V. Hellyer, and Frances married the Revd Frederick Neale.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28357"></a><span class="headword">Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy</span>  (1780&#150;1854)<span class="occ"></span>, who succeeded his father as head of the firm and clockmaker to the king, was born on 25 January 1780, probably at 75 Pall Mall. Although his formal education is unknown, he evidently received a thorough training in both the theoretical and practical aspects of the business. By 1800 he was already helping to run the firm and after he became a partner in 1801 his involvement rapidly increased, so there was little immediate change in the firm's direction when he took over in 1811. He was assisted from 1810 by his younger brother <a name="cosubject_50604"></a><span class="headword">Justin Theodore Vulliamy</span>  (1787&#150;1870)<span class="occ"></span>, who took on much of the administrative work, but problems in working with his domineering older brother led Justin to leave the partnership in 1821. In 1822 Justin became residuary legatee of his uncle Lewis Vulliamy's estate and in 1824 moved to Normandy, where he established a factory for spinning woollen yarn.<br>
<br>During the later years of the regency and the reign of George IV, the steady expansion of government and the rebuilding of central London brought about a gradual shift in the Vulliamy firm's output from the production of expensive decorative objects for private customers to the supply of larger numbers of well made but more austere clocks for the new public institutions. This trend was most pronounced in its growing involvement in producing turret clocks, a field in which Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy became an acknowledged expert and in which he introduced a number of practical improvements, such as the two second pendulum with very heavy bob used on the clock supplied to the Plymouth victualling yard in 1831. In 1844, at the request of his friend the architect Sir Charles Barry, he drew up the original specifications for the great clock for the new houses of parliament. His subsequent failure to secure the contract was attributed by Vulliamy to unfair influences; and being, as Manby's obituary was to note, &#145;fearless in the expression of his opinion of any deviation from the right path&#146;, he reacted by publishing much of the relevant correspondence in 1848 in order to demonstrate the rectitude of his own actions. Several of his other publications were also on the subject of public clocks, though he had earlier contributed to the article on watches in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (1819).<br>
<br>Unlike his father, Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy played a major role in the Clockmakers' Company, of which he was made free in 1809, serving as master five times and fighting strongly on behalf of the declining London trade. He showed a pioneering interest in the early history of the industry and was active in building up the company's museum and library, although his methods of restoration, while typical of his time, have subsequently given him a largely unjustified reputation as a destroyer of his predecessors' work. Apart from business matters, he had an unusually wide range of artistic, scientific, and technical interests, and was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical, Geographical, and Zoological societies and an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to which he left his important horological library. He married Frances Moulton Stiles, daughter of George Stiles, on 3 January 1815; they had three children, Benjamin Lewis (1815&#150;1895), <a name="cosubject_28358"></a><span class="headword">George John Vulliamy</span>  (1817&#150;1886), and Lucy Sarah Frances (1819&#150;1872), none of whom joined the family firm. The occupation of Benjamin Lewis junior is not known but he was in financial difficulties and living in Rome when his father died; George became an <span class="occ">architect and civil engineer</span>; and Lucy married the cleric and schoolmaster S. J. Rigaud, son of Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy's friend, the Oxford professor of astronomy S. P. Rigaud.<br>
<br>Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy died from bronchitis at 68 Pall Mall on 8 January 1854 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. With his death, the firm came to an end. Much of the equipment was left to Vulliamy's leading craftsmen, the Jump family, who set up their own business in Bond Street, London, but the goodwill was bought by another leading London clockmaker, Charles Frodsham, who subsequently obtained Vulliamy's post as superintendent of the royal clocks at Buckingham Palace.<br>
<br>George John Vulliamy was born on 19 May 1817, educated at Westminster School from 1826 to 1833, then articled to Joseph Bramah &amp; Sons, engineers. In July 1836 he entered the office of his father's friend Sir Charles Barry, leaving in 1841 to travel through France, Italy (where he made drawings for Henry Gally Knight's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Italy</span>, 1842&#150;4), Greece, Asia Minor, and Egypt. Returning to England in 1843, he commenced practice as an architect, briefly assisting his uncle, the architect Lewis Vulliamy, on Dorchester House. Among the buildings for which George John Vulliamy was responsible were a mansion at Dyffryn, Monmouthshire, the Swiss church in Endell Street, Westminster, and St Mary, Greenhithe, in Kent. He was a fellow and member of council of the Royal Institute of British Architects, a member, and for a time secretary, of the Royal Archaeological Institute, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1838 and 1845. On 2 April 1851 Vulliamy married Eliza King (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Umfreville); they had five children.<br>
<br>Elected superintending architect to the Metropolitan Board of Works in March 1861, Vulliamy thereafter devoted all his time to this work, designing various buildings, several fire-brigade stations, and the pedestal and sphinxes for Cleopatra's needle on the Embankment. He resigned in 1886 due to ill health and died at his home, Ingress House, Greenhithe, on 12 November 1886; he was buried on 17 November at Stone, near Dartford.<br>
