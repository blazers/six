<span class="headword">Westminster,  Edward  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1265), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of Odo the Goldsmith, whom he succeeded in 1240 as keeper of the king's works at Westminster, which then chiefly concerned the palace. In the following year he was made responsible for the new shrine that Henry III was beginning for Edward the Confessor. In 1245, when the king began to rebuild the abbey itself, Edward became keeper of the works, along with the master mason and a representative of the abbot and convent. While colleagues came and went, he retained this position until his retirement in 1263/4, thus overseeing the building of the eastern chapels, chancel, transepts, chapter house, and a large part of the choir, virtually the whole of King Henry's achievement.<br>
<br>Westminster's first responsibility was for the receipt and expenditure of the money assigned for the operations, a responsibility discharged through a special exchequer set up in 1246, over which he presided. He was far more, however, than a mere passive conduit for funds. He was actively involved both in obtaining money and materials and in ensuring that work was actually carried out. In November 1252, for example, the king told him both to seek timber for the new roof of the abbey and to see that a great new bell was hung before the feast of St Edward: he was not to leave London until it was done. In June 1259 it was to Westminster and two colleagues that the writ was addressed that ordered the pulling down of &#145;the old fabric of the church of Westminster &hellip; as far as the vestry which is by the king's seat &hellip; and to have the same church rebuilt &hellip; in such a manner as the new fabric there requires&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1256&#150;1259</span>, 390), an order that marked the beginning of work on the choir. In securing money for the abbey Westminster was helped by his position as a baron of the exchequer and keeper from 1248 of the exchequer seal; he is one of the earliest known chancellors of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Aside from his work on the abbey Edward of Westminster was constantly involved in procuring vestments, jewels, and a range of other precious objects for the king. He interpreted Henry's wishes to the craftsmen and saw that tight deadlines were met. That he satisfied so impatient and fastidious a monarch for so long says much for his efficiency and sensitivity. It is clear, moreover, that his counsel was valued on artistic matters. In 1245 the king accepted his advice that it would be more splendid to have the leopards, which were planned to go beside the throne at Westminster, made of bronze rather than of marble. It is not impossible, therefore, that Edward influenced features of the abbey's design. Certainly his skill as an administrator was a vital factor in ensuring that so much was built so quickly and magnificently.<br>
<br>Westminster was presumably a clerk in minor orders, since his rewards for his services included the livings of Benenden, Kent, and Ickworth, Suffolk. He was also able to add substantially to his inherited estate, and in 1258 settled lands in Westminster, Surrey, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire on his mistress, Katherine of Ely, with successive remainders to their three sons, Odo, Nicholas, and Thomas. He died in 1265.<br>
