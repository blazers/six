<span class="headword">Blair,  Robert</span>  (1593&#150;1666), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the sixth son of John Blair of Windyedge (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1598), a merchant in Irvine, Ayrshire, and his wife, Beatrix or Bessie Mure (<i>d</i>. 1640s), both of whom traced their descent from landed families. Having &#145;profited well in my bairnly studies&#146;, Blair, between 1611 and 1614, attended the University of Glasgow, where, perceiving himself &#145;to be inferior to none of my fellow-students&#146;, he was smitten by God with a tertian fever for four months &#145;lest I should be puffed up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 7). Subsequently, when he was studying at night in a haunted room, a spirit fled from him, confirming his faith in God's power. Having graduated MA he spent some time as a schoolmaster before becoming, in 1615, a regent at the university. He was licensed to preach the following year.<br>
<br>Blair opposed the reforms of worship embodied in the five articles of Perth (1618) and the growing power of bishops, and his presbyterianism was strengthened by &#145;the daft people of Stewarton&#146;, as enemies called those involved in the Ayrshire religious revival of 1622, and by visiting ministers confined to Turriff and Inverness for holding views similar to his own. Under increasing pressure to conform he resigned his post in Glasgow University in 1623 and became minister of a congregation in Bangor, co. Down. In the freer atmosphere of Ulster, where any protestant minister was welcome, he was ordained by the bishop of Down even though he had explained his objections to episcopacy. However, Blair was suspended from his ministry in 1631 for having taken part in a great revivalist presbyterian communion at Kirk o' Shotts (Lanarkshire) the previous year. Deposition followed in 1632, and his 27-year-old wife, Beatrix Hamilton, whom he had married on 16 July 1626, was &#145;perfected&#146; by death in November 1633  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 100). Undaunted, he travelled to court in England and persuaded Charles I to order his restoration, but his continued nonconformity led to a second deposition in 1634.<br>
<br>Despairing, Blair and his new wife, Katherine (daughter of Hugh, Lord Montgomery of Airds) embarked for New England in 1636, but when their ship was driven back by storms he concluded that this was a sign that God needed him elsewhere. A favour from God was that his infant son did not die at sea, but on the day they landed in Ireland, having been &#145;persecuted to the death by the prelates and their followers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 146). Orders were given for Blair's arrest, and he fled to Scotland early in 1637. He lived in Irvine, Ayrshire, and preached in the surrounding area, joining John Livingstone, David Dickson, and other dissident ministers with whom he had worked for many years, in campaigning against the changes in worship embodied in Charles I's new Scottish prayer book. However, Blair despaired of successful resistance to royal policy and decided that it was now God's wish that he should work in France, something he had long contemplated. He accepted an invitation to become preacher to Hepburn's regiment, a Scottish unit in the French service. However, once on board he found the recruits with whom he was to travel &#145;most profligate, and desperately wicked men&#146; given to &#145;filthy conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 152). On being threatened when he rebuked them, Blair hastily decided that God did not want him to go to France after all, and went ashore.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of open resistance to the new prayer book in July 1637 and the advent of the national covenant in February 1638 Blair became second minister at Ayr, in July 1638, and sat in the general assembly which abolished episcopacy, but he seems to have been reluctant to become involved in organizing the campaign against royal policies. None the less, the persecution he had endured in Ireland and Scotland had made him a revered figure and the assembly ordered his transfer from Ayr to St Andrews. He &#145;earnestlie opposed&#146; the move  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.89), and took up his new post only after the 1639 assembly again ordered him to go. Earlier in 1639 he had acted as chaplain in the Scottish army which had assembled on the borders to oppose the king, and he rejoined the army when it invaded northern England in 1640. Subsequently he went to London as chaplain to the Scots commissioners sent to negotiate a peace settlement. When Charles I visited Scotland in 1641 Blair was chosen to preach before him (8 November), and he preached in Ulster to presbyterians and the Scottish army there for three months in 1642. He was involved with negotiating the solemn league and covenant with England in 1643, and served as a regimental chaplain to a Scottish regiment in England in 1644, being &#145;an eye and ear witness&#146; to the battle on Marston Moor  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 172).<br>
<br>In 1645, when a number of royalists were executed in St Andrews in the bitter aftermath of civil war, Blair was present on the scaffold with Sir Robert Spottiswood. Blair's supporters recorded Spottiswood's &#145;railing discourse&#146; against the covenanters, and asserted that Blair's response was mild: &#145;It's no wonder to hear the son of a false prophet&#146; (the archbishop of St Andrews) speak so of the faithful and honest servants of Jesus Christ. Spottiswood, says Blair, &#145;died railing and raging&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 180). Royalists, however, spoke of Blair being white with fury and breaking &#145;out into scurrilous abuse&#146; of Spottiswood, which he bore in &#145;serene silence&#146;  (G. Wishart, <span class="italic">Memoirs of James Marquis of Montrose</span>, 1893, 171).<br>
<br>Blair was elected moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland on 3 June 1646, and he was one of the ministers subsequently sent to negotiate with Charles I when the king was a prisoner of the Scottish army in England at Newcastle. A few months later Charles agreed to appoint Blair to be his chaplain, regarding him as more acceptable than the other Scottish ministers. Blair accepted the post with reluctance, remaining with the king until, in January 1647, the Scottish army withdrew from England.<br>
<br>Blair opposed the Scottish engagers' attempt to help the king in 1648, and after they were defeated by Cromwell in England he helped persuade the remnants of their army to disband. Sent to England to attend Scottish commissioners there, he sought unsuccessfully to prevent the prosecution and execution of Charles I, and it was rumoured that the king had asked for Blair to accompany him to the scaffold. On his journey home Blair suffered much from gout, and after &#145;being troubled with the gout, and sometimes more pained with the gravel (his two twins as he used to call them)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 218) he was much less active than in the past, although he was one of the ministers who tried to persuade the marquess of Montrose to repent before his execution in May 1650.<br>
<br>When the Scottish church split into warring factions in 1650 Blair sided with the more moderate resolutioners against the protesters, but he saw the dispute as &#145;the heart-break of all honest and moderate men&#146; and, being &#145;displeased with some things on both sides&#146; he worked for reconciliation  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 301). He was one of those summoned to London in May 1654 by Cromwell to try to resolve the matter, but was unwilling to attend and too ill to do so. He concentrated on his work as parish minister but, worn down by the disputes of hostile factions, in 1660 he unsuccessfully sought permission to move from St Andrews to another parish.<br>
<br>On the restoration of monarchy and episcopacy Blair was removed from the ministry (September 1661) after defiantly preaching in support of presbyterianism. He was at first confined to his room in Edinburgh, but in January 1662 he was ordered instead to confine himself in the parish of Musselburgh. Blair disliked the place and soon obtained permission to move to Kirkcaldy, where he remained for three and a half years. He continued preaching to and worshipping with presbyterian dissidents, but in February 1666, fearing action would be taken against him, he withdrew to Couston, near Aberdour. There his presence still attracted dissidents, but he soon fell ill, &#145;being worn with old age, but much more with sorrow&#146;. He died on 27 August 1666 and was buried in Aberdour.<br>
<br>As well as his autobiography (which ends in the 1630s) and some Latin verse Blair wrote a preface for James Durham's <span class="italic">The Dying Man's Testimony &hellip; a Treatise on Scandal</span> (1659), and several other works which remained unpublished. Though stubborn in his resistance to episcopacy, Blair seems to have had little taste for controversy or a role in public affairs, and was influential mainly through his preaching, praying, and piety. Robert Baillie, who had been his student, was devoted to him, praising him for &#145;his great dexteritie; yea greater than any man I know living, to insinuate the fear of God in the hearts of young schollars&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.174).<br>
