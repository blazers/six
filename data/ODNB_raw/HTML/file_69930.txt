<span class="headword">MacGregor,  Alexander</span>  (1806&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and writer of Scottish Gaelic prose</span>, was born on 26 May 1806 at the Mission House, Dalfuil, Glengairn, near Ballater, the eldest of the four children of the Revd Robert MacGregor (1767&#150;1846) and his wife, Janet Menzies. Robert MacGregor was a collector of Gaelic poetry and a Gaelic poet. In addition to being a missionary on the Royal Bounty, he taught at a school during the week and it was there that Alexander received his early education before proceeding to King's College, Aberdeen, from which he graduated MA in 1827, having gained prizes in natural philosophy and mathematics. He then attended the Divinity Hall at the University of Edinburgh from 1831 to 1835. On concluding his studies he rejoined his parents who were now resident in the parish of Kilmuir, Skye, to which his father had answered a call in 1822. Remaining with the established church after the Disruption of 1843, he was ordained as assistant and successor to his father in 1844. On 18 December 1846 he married Catherine MacGregor (1822&#150;1889); they had eight children, of whom six survived to adulthood. Their eldest grandson was Sir Alasdair Duncan Atholl MacGregor (1883&#150;1945) whose posts included appointment as chief justice of the supreme court of Hong Kong in 1934. In 1850 Alexander MacGregor accepted a call to Edinburgh's Gaelic church and in 1853 he was translated to the West Church, Inverness, where he remained until he died in 1881. After his death one writer observed that:<blockquote>his large heart, his truly catholic spirit, his boundless charity knew not the mean, selfish, repulsive creed of those that would scarcely admit to Heaven any one but those who could see eye to eye with them in matters of ecclesiastical form and ceremony. (Mackenzie, 93)</blockquote>MacGregor was one of the most prolific writers in Scottish Gaelic in the nineteenth century, contributing under the pen-names Alasdair Ruadh, Sgiathanach, and S. to most contemporary periodicals which published Gaelic. He has received little attention from scholars of Gaelic literature in the past, in part because Gaelic prose is under-researched as compared with poetry and song, but equally because his use of pen-names has tended to conceal the true extent and significance of his writing. Until the nineteenth century Gaelic prose was predominantly religious in nature and tended to be translated rather than original. MacGregor's writings, along with those of the Revd Dr Norman MacLeod (1783&#150;1862), were crucial in establishing a register for non-religious writing, and broke new ground by experimenting with new genres, most notably the prose dialogue. His Gaelic writings appeared mainly in <span class="italic">Cuairtear nan Gleann</span> (1840&#150;43), <span class="italic">Fear-Tathaich nam Beann</span> (1848&#150;50), <span class="italic">An Gaidheal</span> (1871&#150;7), and <span class="italic">Highlander</span> (1873&#150;81).<br>
<br>One of MacGregor's aims was to provide useful information and morally uplifting literature for Gaels in their native language. Thus his writings cover a breadth of subjects, ranging from essays which describe North America for intending emigrants, support the abolition of slavery, explain astronomy and coral, discuss education in the highlands, and argue the need for both Gaelic and English to be used in highland schools, to moral tales which promote self-help, temperance, and thrift. His prose dialogues, of which he wrote no fewer than sixty-four, draw on similar topics to his essays, but attempt to make information accessible to readers by using more colloquial language and by using characters to lend authority to the information being conveyed. MacGregor's partiality for this genre indicates a consciousness of his audience's requirements, as he used the dialogue to facilitate the transition between an essentially oral culture and the printed word. He also wrote prose in English relating to the highlands and he undertook a number of translations from English to Gaelic. He translated texts of guidance for fishermen and mariners into Gaelic, but most notable was his translation into Gaelic of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, undertaken at the request of Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte and published in 1860. MacGregor had a great interest in highland folklore and history and was described by a contemporary as &#145;our best Gaelic scholar, and the first authority upon all questions connected with the history, antiquities, traditions, language and literature of his countrymen&#146;  (Mackenzie, 95). In common with a number of contemporaries, such as Sheriff Alexander Nicolson, he collected Gaelic proverbs. However, instead of presenting them in the usual form of a list, he embedded them in his dialogues so as to display them in a manner more reflective of their everyday use. He wrote over thirty essays in English on highland destitution, Gaelic literature, and highland history. His contribution on the parish of Kilmuir to the <span class="italic">New Statistical Account of Scotland</span> runs to some fifty pages and contains a wealth of information. His collected essays on Flora Macdonald were published in one volume, <span class="italic">The Life of Flora Macdonald and her Adventures with Prince Charlie</span> (1882), as were some of his writings on highland folklore in <span class="italic">Highland Superstitions</span> (1891) and a lecture on highland history in <span class="italic">The Feuds of the Clans</span> (1907). He was instrumental in setting up the <span class="italic">Celtic Magazine</span> in 1876 along with Alexander MacKenzie, who was to be its editor.<br>
<br>MacGregor died on 19 October 1881 at his home, 4 Victoria Terrace, Inverness, and was buried five days later in the chapelyard, Inverness. An elegy to him was composed by the renowned Gaelic poet Mary MacPherson (1821&#150;1898), &#145;Marbhrann don Urramach Alasdair MacGriogair&#146; (&#145;Elegy to the Reverend Alexander MacGregor&#146;)  (Meek, 140).<br>
