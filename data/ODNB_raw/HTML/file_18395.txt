<span class="headword">Maxey,  Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1618), <span class="occ">dean of Windsor</span>, was probably a member of the Maxey family of Bradwell juxta Coggeshall, Essex. Educated as a queen's scholar at Westminster School, on 18 April 1578 he was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1582, proceeding MA in 1585, BTh in 1594, and DD in 1608, but failed to win a fellowship. Ordained deacon and priest in the diocese of Lincoln on 7 May 1589, Maxey was rector of Hackford, Norfolk, from that year until 1602. In 1591 he acquired the rectory of Horham, Suffolk, and held it until 1595, by when he had been installed rector of Reepham, Norfolk. He is also credited with the rectory of Winterton in the same county. He resigned from Reepham in 1612, at about the same time that he acquired yet another rectory, that of Horton in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>By the beginning of 1605 Maxey had become a chaplain-in-ordinary to James I, and frequently preached before the king. On Ascension day 1605, for instance, he eulogized James's court as &#145;the most religious court &hellip; that is in Christendome&#146;  (McCullough, 130). Another court sermon of that year suggests he may have sympathized with the nonconformists recently deprived of their livings, but he was none the less careful to praise the ceremonies which had been their undoing. Maxey's incomes spiralled and honours multiplied, and on 21 June 1612 James appointed him registrar of the Order of the Garter and dean of Windsor; he was instituted on the 25th. He usually attended meetings of the Windsor chapter, which on 30 March 1614 resolved to present him to the rectory of West Isley, Berkshire. Several sermons preached before the king were published soon afterwards, all of them appearing in the posthumous editions of <span class="italic">Certaine Sermons Preached before the King's Majesty</span> (1619, 1634). These also include his address given at the marriage of Ralph Sadler to Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Coke, at the Savoy on 14 September 1601, and another given before the lords of the council in Lent 1618.<br>
<br>Aptly described as &#145;an unblushing simonist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Westminsters</span>, 2.634), Maxey offered money to Sir Henry Hobart, attorney-general between 1606 and 1613, in the hope of gaining preferment, while in April 1618 John Chamberlain reported that he had made the highest bid for the vacant see of Norwich, topping the offer of Valentine Carey, dean of St Paul's. But the prize eluded him. Maxey died on 3 May 1618, the day on which he made his will; probate was granted on the 18th, his executor being his kinsman Amyas Maxey. He mentions several other relations but no children, referring to his wife only as having died at least ten years earlier. He left eighty books to the library of the chapter at Windsor, and sums of money to relatives and servants; two faithful servants each received &pound;10 and a horse, &#145;but unto Roger my cooke, beinge verye lewde in his tongue, and besides corruptinge my clarke Roberte Berrye with tobacco and drinkinge, nothinge&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/131, fol. 369<i>r</i>). Maxey held the lease of a house in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and it was in St Martin's Church that he was buried.<br>
