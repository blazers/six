<span class="headword">Wilmot, Sir  John Eardley  Eardley-</span>, first baronet  (1783&#150;1847), <span class="occ">politician and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 21 February 1783 in London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29625/', "John Eardley Eardley-Wilmot MP (bap. 1749, d. 1815)")</script>, and his first wife, Frances (1759&#150;1838), the only daughter of Samuel Sainthill. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29624/', "Sir John Eardley Wilmot (1709&#150;1792)")</script>, chief justice of the court of common pleas. He was educated at Harrow School and called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 9 May 1806. Though he did not practise, he was chairman of the quarter sessions for Warwickshire from 1830 to 1843. He was also MP for North Warwickshire between December 1832 and 1843. A liberal tory, he was an active campaigner for the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of black people in the empire. He followed Edward Stanley (later earl of Derby) into relative political exile when the latter resigned from the government in May 1834 over the intervention by the British government in the revenues of the Irish established church. Meanwhile Eardley-Wilmot had been elected to the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries, had published an <span class="italic">Abridgement of Blackstone's Commentaries</span> (1822) and a <span class="italic">Letter to the Magistrates on the Increase of Crime</span> (1827), and, in 1821, had been created a baronet, as the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> phrased it, &#145;as a reward for the services of his grandfather, his father having repeatedly refused any mark of distinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1847, 204). In addition he had married, first, on 21 May 1808, Elizabeth Emma (<i>d</i>. 1818), the daughter of the distinguished physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21410/', "C. H. Parry")</script>, and, second, on 30 August 1819, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1869), the eldest daughter of Sir Robert Chester of Bush Hill in Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Eardley-Wilmot's demonstrated interest in penal and imperial matters, together with his association with Stanley, secretary of state for the colonies since 1841, might seem to have made him an acceptable candidate for the post of lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land after Sir John Franklin was recalled on 10 February 1843. However, when his appointment was announced <span class="italic">The Times</span> described it as &#145;the worst that could be made&#146;  (1 March 1843). None the less, the appointment was sustained, and Wilmot sailed for the colony with his three sons, leaving his second wife in England. He arrived in Van Diemen's Land on 18 August 1843 to find that factional quarrels between Franklin and his official establishment had left the authority of the government considerably eroded at a time of political aspiration for representative institutions, while a new system of penal management was causing increasing unease with imperial authority, unease which was to focus ever more on its representative, the lieutenant-governor.<br>
<br>A House of Commons select committee had in 1837&#150;8 recommended the cessation of transportation to New South Wales and that the &#145;assignment system&#146; be replaced by the &#145;probation system&#146;. While the assignment system had been criticized as &#145;white slavery&#146;  (<span class="italic">EdinR</span>, 86, 1847, 225 and 231&#150;2), marked by unpredictable treatment of prisoners from the different masters to whom they were assigned, in practice it had worked tolerably well. Under an efficient system of supervision, prisoners were separated from their former criminal associates and could learn new trades and skills as they progressed towards pardon and freedom. Their labour had boosted the wealth of the colonists, who were thus encouraged to manage their convicts well to avoid becoming ineligible for assignees, as well as that of the colony in general. The new probation system by contrast rested on the organization of prisoners into gangs of up to 700, at &#145;probation stations&#146;, where it was hoped hard work and close supervision would surely and scientifically lead to their reformation. Less objectionable in theory, the new system proved disastrous in practice. It required numerous expert supervisors and a robust economy, both to sustain the much more expensive system and to hire the convicts once they reached the passholder stage. In practice the colony was entering recession; colonists were unwilling and increasingly unable to hire convict labour which had previously been free; and the cessation of transportation to New South Wales brought an influx of convicts which far outstripped the colony's ability to bear most of the cost of penal administration. These factors, combined with resentment that the limited representation which had been allowed to New South Wales in 1842 was not extended to Van Diemen's Land because it was deemed inappropriate for a penal colony, challenged the authority of the new lieutenant-governor.<br>
<br>However Eardley-Wilmot's rule opened promisingly. His tour of the island and his early official receptions were successful. Meanwhile the probation system appeared to be functioning satisfactorily, according to the reports of the comptroller-general of convicts, Matthew Forster. Later Eardley-Wilmot was condemned for accepting those reports, as it soon became clear (in both Van Diemen's Land and London) that they and Eardley-Wilmot's dispatches were glossing over a problem which was threatening the political economy of the colony. Between 1841 and 1847, 39,000 convicts arrived in the depressed colony. Land sales, previously an important source of government revenue, had slumped, and Eardley-Wilmot could not meet the basic costs of the system, despite Stanley's insistence that it was economically viable. Eardley-Wilmot argued for redistribution of the economic burden away from the colony, but did not publicize his efforts to the colonists. Meanwhile probation gangs, sometimes with only seven supervisors to a gang of 300, were increasingly a source of terror, while the plight of destitute unemployed convict passholders was becoming scandalous.<br>
<br>Eardley-Wilmot, meanwhile, had clashed with the new bishop of Van Diemen's Land, F. R. Nixon, over whose was the ultimate authority over chaplains ministering to the convict service. The Colonial Office eventually upheld the governor's position, but the quarrel left the bishop ready to take notice of rumours about Eardley-Wilmot's private life. They were largely the product of factional gossip, but Eardley-Wilmot's conduct, unconstrained by his wife's presence, did occasion understandable comment. Despite denials by Eardley-Wilmot himself and others on his behalf, gossip, particularly concerning his relationship with Julia Sorrell, became increasingly damaging, especially when coupled with allegations that homosexuality was rife among convicts. Eardley-Wilmot himself had reported &#145;this nameless crime&#146;, &#145;this dreadful evil&#146;, in a dispatch to Stanley in November 1843  (Eardley-Wilmot to Gladstone, 26 Sept 1846, TNA: PRO, CO 280/196 p. 531). He recorded his efforts to control it: but lurid reports and personal slurs against him were brought by the bishop and others to the ears of the new secretary of state for the colonies, W. E. Gladstone, who had succeeded Stanley in December 1845.<br>
<br>However, before Gladstone had taken office, political crisis supervened in Van Diemen's Land on 3 November 1845 following Eardley-Wilmot's efforts, in obedience to the Colonial Office, to raise revenue to meet the escalating costs of the convict system. Vigorous protests were made under the slogan &#145;No taxation without representation&#146;, and on 2 November &#145;the patriotic six&#146;, unofficial members of the nominated legislative council, withdrew, leaving the council inquorate. News of this crisis precipitated Eardley-Wilmot's recall, but other reports about the condition of the penal system in the colony had by then made such a recall inevitable. Yet there was a difficulty for the Colonial Office, for James Stephen had realized that, whatever the merits or failings of the probation system, it was economically unviable in Van Diemen's Land, and, in response to Eardley-Wilmot's representations, Britain had already increased her share of the cost of police and gaols expenditure to two-thirds. The constitutional crisis could not be a public reason for Eardley-Wilmot's recall. Stephen, whose meticulous mind had been affronted by the inadequacies of Eardley-Wilmot's dispatches, suggested to his minister that it would be expedient if Eardley-Wilmot could be recalled on other grounds.<br>
<br>Gladstone, who had been offended by moral deficiencies of both the system and Eardley-Wilmot personally, devised a form of recall which led to public sensation. In an official dispatch Eardley-Wilmot was recalled for his &#145;insensibility to the vast importance of the moral and religious state of the convicts sent to [Van Diemen's Land] as shown in the transient and meagre communications [Eardley-Wilmot's dispatches] addressed to His Majesty's Government&#146; and &#145;evinced by the reports of individuals which have been transmitted home&#146; and because &#145;there was no hope through [his] instrumentality to bring the character and results of transportation to a fair issue, of being enabled either to achieve success or even to ascertain failure&#146;  (Gladstone to Eardley-Wilmot, 30 April 1846, Archives Office of Tasmania GO 1/61 p. 190). The dispatch occasioned considerable discussion and press comment in Britain, but Gladstone's accompanying &#145;secret&#146; letter created a public sensation. In this letter (also dated 30 April 1846) Gladstone informed Eardley-Wilmot that &#145;certain rumours have reached me from a variety of quarters relating to your private life&#146; such that &#145;it would be impossible to recommend your resumption of active duties under the Crown in any other colony until they [the rumours] are satisfactorily disposed of&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>To this, Eardley-Wilmot, who had been preparing a response to the official recall on the grounds, <i>inter alia</i>, of his necessary reliance on Forster's reports, and the fact that he had reported the moral problem, responded vigorously. In a dispatch he demanded Gladstone &#145;specify immediately the dates, places, persons and circumstances to which the rumours against my Private life apply&#146;  (Eardley-Wilmot to Gladstone, 5 Oct 1846, TNA: PRO, CO, 280/196, p. 542). He published the letter in the executive council of the colony, and swiftly achieved a public vindication when 250 leading citizens expressed their &#145;unqualified contradiction of those reports &hellip; injurious to your moral character during your administration of the Government of this colony&#146;  (West, 1.259), thus, Eardley-Wilmot argued, both &#145;satisfactorily disposing&#146; of the unspecified rumours and fulfilling Gladstone's prerequisite for imperial re-employment.<br>
<br>Faced by this response, Gladstone had to inform Eardley-Wilmot &#145;that the persons who made known to me the rumours &hellip; did not profess to support their credit by any statement of particulars of the kind to which you refer&#146; and reluctantly conceded that the testimonial Eardley-Wilmot had forwarded &#145;was an appropriate and sufficient answer&#146;  (Gladstone to Eardley-Wilmot, 9 March 1847, TNA: PRO, CO 408/26, pp. 309, 311&#150;12), and that, were he still secretary of state, it might be that Eardley-Wilmot might now be eligible for re-employment. However, his successor, Earl Grey, declared he was &#145;entirely ignorant of the grounds&#146;  (Grey to Eardley-Wilmot, 20 March 1847, TNA: PRO, CO 408/26, p. 314) for Gladstone's action and unable to hold out any hope to Eardley-Wilmot of re-employment.<br>
<br>Supporters of Eardley-Wilmot were soon insisting he had suffered a gross injustice, and the affair assumed further prominence when news of his sudden death on 3 February 1847 (before he received either Gladstone's or Grey's responses) arrived in England on 3 June 1847. The cause was &#145;a complete exhaustion of the frame&#146; and &#145;decay of nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 June 1847), and immediately questions of mismanagement and morals receded before the spectacle of a man of standing's being hounded to death. In a debate in the House of Commons on 7 June 1847 Eardley-Wilmot's character and honour were cleared. In addition the ill-conceived probation system was soon abandoned, and transportation to Australian colonies ceased altogether in 1852. In the colony sentiment favoured a man now widely seen as most unjustly treated. A handsome monument was erected to his memory, while a further memorial was the Royal Society of Tasmania, which he had reconstituted from the Tasmanian Society founded by Sir John Franklin, and which was the first overseas branch of the Royal Society in the British empire.<br>
<br>Eardley-Wilmot was survived by six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29626/', "Sir John Eardley Eardley-Wilmot, second baronet")</script>, and two sons and two daughters from his second. His grandson was the forester Sainthill Eardley-Wilmot (1852&#150;1929).<br>
