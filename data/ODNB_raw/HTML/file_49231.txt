<span class="headword">Little,  Kenneth Lindsay</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born at 97 Priory Road, West Derby, Liverpool, on 19 September 1908, the son of Harold Muir Little, a ship broker, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Livesey. Little was educated at Liverpool College and at Selwyn College, Cambridge, as a mature student in the late 1930s, having previously worked in a repertory theatre. His interest was in physical anthropology, and when the lecturer was called up for military service, Little left the students' benches for the lecturer's rostrum and finished off the course. Declared medically unfit for the armed forces, he was appointed William Wyse student at Trinity College, Cambridge, and an assistant in the Duckworth laboratory. In this capacity he travelled to Cardiff in the summer vacation of 1940 to study the stature of what he called, in the terminology of the time, the &#145;Anglo-negroid cross&#146;. It was a kind of research that led into a dead end, but while in Cardiff Little became interested in the social aspects of black&#150;white interaction and racial discrimination&#151;then referred to as the colour bar. His London PhD thesis (supervised by Raymond Firth and published in 1948 as <span class="italic">Negroes in Britain</span>) brought together elements from the British tradition of social surveys with lessons from the Chicago school of sociology and the Lynds' <span class="italic">Middletown</span>. Balancing this with a history of racial attitudes, Little developed a novel theory that &#145;colour-class-consciousness&#146; underlay racial discrimination in Britain. By the time the book was published, Little was in Sierra Leone conducting an ethnographic study of the Mende which, in addition to its careful examination of rice farming, paid much more attention to social change than did other contemporary ethnographies. He returned to an appointment at the London School of Economics as lecturer in anthropology, with special reference to race relations.<br>
<br>Moving to head the department of social anthropology at the University of Edinburgh in 1950 (first as reader, then from 1965 as professor and from 1971 as professor of African urban studies, becoming emeritus in 1978), Little started a programme of research into British racial relations and then another into the changes associated with urbanization in west Africa. He travelled extensively, both to teach and to study. His early invitation to Fisk University (Nashville, Tennessee) and his other visits to US universities meant a lot to him, but he was particularly proud of having established the department of social anthropology at the University of Sudan in Khartoum while on leave from Edinburgh. More than most Europeans of his generation, Little struck up easy personal relations with members of the new African &eacute;lite, male and female, and wrote about their parts in the changes their societies were undergoing. This was not the kind of research that builds prestige in universities. It could invoke no intellectual tradition and it challenged the prevailing demarcation of social anthropology and sociology. Its pursuit required a measure of courage as well as independence of mind, but by his pioneering work Little made it easier for his junior colleagues to take up such studies.<br>
<br>In 1968 Little was appointed the first chairman of the home secretary's advisory committee on race relations research, but cerebral malaria&#151;contracted on a visit to Ghana&#151;prevented him from exploiting the new research opportunities that were opening in this field and occasioned his move sideways within the university. After <span class="italic">The Mende of Sierra Leone</span> (1951) and the UNESCO booklet <span class="italic">Race and Society</span> (1952) he went on to author <span class="italic">West African Urbanization</span> (1967), <span class="italic">African Women in Towns</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Urbanization as a Social Process</span> (1974), and <span class="italic">The Sociology of Urban Women's Image in African Literature</span> (1980). On 28 August 1939 he had married Birte Hoeck; they had a daughter, Katherine, and a son, John. After the dissolution of this marriage he was married from 2 June 1956 to 1979 to Iris Mary Buchanan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cadogan, a nursing sister. He died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh, on 28 February 1991.<br>
