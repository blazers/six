<span class="headword">Hopkins,  William</span>  (1647&#150;1700), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born at Evesham, Worcestershire, on 2 August 1647, and baptized on 28 August, the son of <a name="cosubject_13747"></a><span class="headword">George Hopkins</span>  (1620&#150;1666), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, then vicar of All Saints, Evesham. It is not certainly known whether the wife who survived George Hopkins, Margaret, was also William's mother. George Hopkins was born at Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 15 April 1620, the son of William Hopkins (<i>d</i>. in or after 1641), who was described by Richard Baxter as &#145;the most eminent, wise, and truly religious magistrate of Bewdley&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.92). George matriculated from New Inn Hall, Oxford, in 1638, graduating BA in 1641 and proceeding MA in 1648. Vicar of Evesham from 1642 he also served in the parliamentarian armies, presumably as a chaplain. Hopkins was, like his father, a friend of Baxter, who wrote a preface for his <span class="italic">Salvation from Sin</span> (1655) and later cited him as the authority for &#145;the certainest and fullest instance of witchcraft that ever I knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 275). In the 1650s George Hopkins was an assistant to the Worcestershire commission of ejectors and an active member of the Worcestershire association of ministers. He was ejected from his living in 1662 under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, and moved to Dumbleton, Gloucestershire. There he took the so-called Oxford oath to avoid further proscription under the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> of 1665. He died between 2 March (when he made his will) and 30 June 1666 (when it was proved).<br>
<br>William Hopkins was educated at Evesham grammar school and matriculated as a commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, in October 1661. He moved to St Mary Hall in 1666, and proceeded MA in 1668. In 1671&#150;2 he accompanied Henry Coventry (1619&#150;1686) as his chaplain on an embassy to Sweden. Coventry returned to become secretary of state, Hopkins returned with an enthusiastic interest in the languages and history of the Germanic north. With Coventry's support he was appointed a prebendary of Worcester Cathedral, where he was installed in March 1675. He married Averill (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of Thomas Martin, on 3 February 1678.<br>
<br>From that time Hopkins worked closely with the dean of Worcester, the learned George Hickes, the nonjuror, both in the cathedral chapter and in pioneering studies of Old English. He did not, however, immediately take up residence in Worcester. The dean and chapter appointed him to the curacy of Mortlake, Surrey, in June 1678, and in 1680 he was afternoon preacher at St Lawrence Jewry, London, then newly rebuilt by Wren. He exchanged Mortlake for the vicarage of Lindridge, Worcestershire, in 1686, and then went to live in the city. He was appointed master of St Oswald's Hospital, Worcester, in 1697 but surrendered his salary there to establish an endowment for the hospital. His wife, Averill, died in 1691; he married for a second time in 1699 Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bromley, widow of Dr Thomas Whitehorne of Tewkesbury.<br>
<br>Hopkins proceeded DD on 5 July 1692. He had combined his theological and his historical interests in 1686 in publishing Bertramnus of Corbie's eucharistic tract <span class="italic">De sanguine et corpore domini</span> as <span class="italic">The Book of Bertram or Ratramnus Concerning the Body and Blood of the Lord</span>, with Latin text and an English translation. In 1691 he ventured into religion and politics in <span class="italic">Animadversions on Mr Johnson's Answer to Jovian</span>. By that time George Hickes had been deprived of his deanery for not taking the oaths to William and Mary, and <span class="italic">Animadversions</span> was a contribution to a convoluted exchange on divine right and unconditional obedience between Hickes, writing as Jovian, and Samuel Johnson (1649&#150;1703), the author of <span class="italic">Julian the Apostate</span>. Hopkins's intervention was largely a mark of his friendship with Hickes, which was evidently not impaired by his own conformity to the new regime. He was generally more concerned with scholarship than politics. He assisted Edmund Gibson, later bishop of London, in preparing <span class="italic">Chronicon Saxonicum</span> (1692) and Gibson's first translation of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>. He also provided Anthony Wood with lists of Worcester clergy and other notes for Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxoniensis</span>, and collected material for a history of Worcester Cathedral.<br>
<br>Hopkins died at Worcester of a fever on 18 May 1700, and was buried in the cathedral. There was a memorial there to him, which seems to have named only his first wife. It was later removed and lost, but was replaced in 1910 by a small brass inscription in the north transept, which probably marks the site of his grave. George Hickes published <span class="italic">Seventeen Sermons</span>, from Hopkins's papers, in 1708, prefaced by a memoir of his friend's life and work.<br>
