<span class="headword">Postgate,  John</span>  (1820&#150;1881), <span class="occ">campaigner against adulteration of food</span>, the son of a Scarborough builder, Thomas Postgate, and his wife, Jane Wade, was descended from an ancient Roman Catholic family of Yorkshire, of which a representative, Nicholas Postgate (<i>c</i>.1596&#150;1679), was executed at York during the panic caused by the Popish Plot. Born at Scarborough on 21 October 1820, John Postgate started working as a grocer's boy at the age of eleven. In 1834 he became an assistant to a surgeon at the modest salary of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week. His leisure hours he devoted to self-improvement, and he worked hard at Latin, chemistry, and botany: at the age of seventeen he wrote and published in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Magazine</span> a paper on &#145;Rare plants and their properties&#146;. He subsequently attended lectures at the Leeds school of medicine; in July 1847 he qualified at Apothecaries' Hall, and earned the means to continue his education by acting as assistant to a firm in the east end of London. He attended the London Hospital, and satisfied the Royal College of Surgeons in 1848. Postgate married, in May 1850, Mary Ann (1815&#150;1898), daughter of Joshua Horwood of Driffield, Yorkshire. In May 1851 he moved to Birmingham, where he soon acquired a position of influence. Three years later he was elected a fellow of the College of Surgeons, and began his lifelong crusade against the adulteration of food substances, into the secrets of which his experience as a grocer's boy had given him a grim insight.<br>
<br>Postgate succeeded in interesting the Birmingham MPs William Scholefield and George Frederick Muntz in the subject, and on 26 June 1855 Scholefield moved for a select committee of inquiry in the House of Commons. Postgate was frequently examined, and by means of circulars and letters he maintained public interest in the question. Meetings were held in the large towns of the north, and samples of such commodities as bread, flour, ground coffee, mustard, vinegar, pepper, wine, beer, and drugs, as adulterated by the local retailers, were publicly exhibited and analysed.<br>
<br>The local appointment of public analysts, coupled with the bestowal of powers of summary jurisdiction upon the magistracy, was the principal means by which Postgate proposed to repress such frauds, and his suggestions were substantially embodied in the recommendations of the select committee. Altogether, no fewer than nine bills dealing with adulteration were introduced into the House of Commons by the members for Birmingham under Postgate's influence. However, their efforts met with strenuous opposition from retailers. Eventually, in 1860, a comparatively gentle measure, giving local authorities the option of appointing public analysts, with powers to prosecute offending tradesmen, became law. It was to remedy the manifest defects of this permissive and largely inoperative measure that Muntz, at Postgate's instance, subsequently introduced the <span class="roman">Amendment Act</span>, which included medicines and eventually became law in 1872. However, the measure still lacked teeth and other suggestions of Postgate's (including the establishment of statutory public analysts and a network of monitors) were embodied only in the landmark <span class="roman">Sale of Food and Drugs Act</span> of 1875. This legislation, the basis of modern statutes, was followed by similar measures in the British colonies. Postgate obtained no public recognition of any kind for his services, and he spent a huge proportion of his own income in pursuing the question of adulteration, thereby earning the animosity of members of his own family, who suffered severe privation as a consequence. His grandson, Raymond Postgate, learned from his own father that John &#145;was so devoted to the cause of preventing adulteration that he used to steal from grandmother's purse the money which he had given to her already for house-keeping, in order to spend it on pamphlets&#146;  (Postgate, 33).<br>
<br>Postgate took an active part in the inauguration in Birmingham of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science in 1857. Two papers by him on adulteration were published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> for 1857 and 1868 respectively. On 7 May 1860 he was appointed professor of medical jurisprudence and toxicology at Queen's College, Birmingham. He died from stomach cancer on 26 September 1881 at the London Hospital in Whitechapel, having been taken ill at Neuenahr, near Bonn. He was buried in the new cemetery at Birmingham. His epitaph records that, for &#145;twenty-five years of his life, without reward, and under heavy discouragement, he laboured to protect the health and to purify the commerce of this people&#146;. He left a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35582/', "John Percival Postgate")</script>, and two daughters, Isabella Jane Postgate and Agnes Foord Postgate. His grandson Raymond William Postgate founded <span class="italic">The Good Food Guide</span>.<br>
