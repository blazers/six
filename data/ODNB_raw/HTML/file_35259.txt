<span class="headword">Norton,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1904), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 28 September 1823 at Bristol, the son of John Norton and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Russell. In 1846, after attending Bristol grammar school, he became a pupil in the London office of Benjamin Ferrey; he also attended the classes of Professor Thomas Leverton Donaldson at the University of London, where he won a first prize in 1848. In 1857 he married Helen Mary, the only daughter of Peter Le Neve Aldous Arnold; they had eight daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Norton became an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1850 and a fellow in 1857; he was for a time a member of its council, and became president of the Architectural Association for the 1858&#150;9 session. He was honorary secretary of the Arundel Society (which produced printed copies of paintings by old masters) throughout its existence (1848&#150;98) and a council member of the Artists' General Benevolent Institution.<br>
<br>Norton was for some time in partnership with Philip Edward Masey and quickly built up a large and lucrative architectural practice which handled both domestic and ecclesiastical commissions. He worked for a number of wealthy patrons, including the maharaja Duleep Singh (for whom he built Elveden Hall, Suffolk, 1863&#150;70), William Gibbs (who commissioned the rebuilding of Tyntesfield, Somerset), and Alexander Acland-Hood, first Baron St Audries (for whom he designed a house and church at St Audries in Somerset in <i>c</i>.1856). His other principal works were: Badgemore, Oxfordshire, for Richard Ovey; Ferney Hall, Shropshire (after 1856), for W. Hurt-Sitwell; Horstead Hall, Norfolk, for Sir E. Birkbeck; Nutfield Priory, Surrey (1858&#150;9), for H. E. Gurney; Monkhams, Essex, for H. Ford Barclay; Euston Hall, Suffolk, for the duke of Grafton; public works and buildings of the new boulevard, Florence; International College, Isleworth; the Winter Gardens at Great Yarmouth and Tynemouth; Langland Bay Hotel, south Wales; South Western Terminus Hotel, Southampton (1872); Fickle Castle, Estonia; Framlingham Hall, Norfolk; Brent Knoll, Somerset (1862&#150;4); Summers Place, Sussex (now an outpost of Sothebys); Chew Magna Manor House, Somerset (1864); the town hall and constitutional club, Neath; and a training college for the diocese of Gloucester and Bristol. He also won the Bombay public markets competition.<br>
<br>Among Norton's London commissions were the Turf Club, Piccadilly; the Submarine Telegraph Company's office, Throgmorton Avenue; the Canada government buildings and Victoria Mansions, Westminster; as well as mansions in Mandeville Place and several hotels, business premises, and residential flats elsewhere in London.<br>
<br>Norton did not work exclusively in Gothic, though this was the norm for his church designs, the most important of which was Christ Church in Finchley (1870). His other church commissions included those at Stapleton, Stoke Bishop, and Frampton Cotterell in Gloucestershire; St Matthew's, Brighton, Sussex; St John's, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire; those at Bourton, High Bridge, and Congresbury in Somerset; and St Luke's, St Matthias, Emmanuel (Clifton), and the parish church of Bedminster in Bristol. He designed a number of churches in Wales and Monmouthshire, including those at Pontypridd and Llwynmadog. He was responsible for the church on Lundy island and others at Powerscourt, Wicklow; Chevington, near Howick, Northumberland; Bagn&egrave;res de Bigorre in the French Pyrenees; and Bishop Hannington's Memorial Church, Frere Town, Kenya.<br>
<br>Norton acted as architect to the Crystal Palace Company, for the Ascot Land Company, and for several London clubs. He was also responsible for the Church Missionary Society children's home at Limpsfield and the Royal Normal College for the Blind at Norwood, Surrey; the county courts at Williton, Dunster, and Long Ashton in Somerset; and the High Cross at Bristol. He died at Casalini, his home in Bournemouth, on 10 November 1904, and was buried there. He was survived by his wife. His son Charles Harrold Norton (1867&#150;1942) succeeded him in his practice.<br>
