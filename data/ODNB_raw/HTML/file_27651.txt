<span class="headword">Tracy,  Robert</span>  (1655&#150;1735), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Toddington, Gloucestershire, the fifth son of Robert Tracy, second Viscount Tracy of Rathcoole (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1662), but the first son with his second wife, Dorothy (<i>bap</i>. 1630, <i>d</i>. 1685), daughter of Thomas Cocks of Castleditch, Herefordshire. Tracy matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 29 October 1672, aged seventeen, and entered the Middle Temple on 15 April 1673. He was called to the bar on 21 May 1680. He married on 29 August 1683 Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1659, <i>d</i>. 1714), daughter of William Dowdeswell of Pull Court, Worcestershire. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In July 1699 Tracy was appointed second justice of the Irish king's bench. In November 1700 he was made a serjeant-at-law in order that on the 15th he could transfer to the court of exchequer in England. Despite a little concern expressed to Robert Harley over his future, following the death of William III, Tracy was transferred to the court of common pleas on 23 June 1702. In July 1705 he was perceived as Harley's candidate to succeed Nathan Wright as lord keeper. In 1706 he was one of only two puisne judges appointed by the House of Lords to the law (defects) committee. He presided over the trials of those indicted for riot during the Sacheverell trial in 1710, and in the hiatus that followed Lord Cowper's resignation of the seals in September 1710 Tracy was one of three men given temporary custody of the great seal, and was again considered a possible lord keeper or even lord chancellor, though the posts had never before gone to a puisne judge.<br>
<br>Tracy was reappointed to common pleas in November 1714 following the accession of George I. In December 1716 he tried the Scottish Jacobite rebels in Carlisle, giving &#145;a very handsome charge&#146;  (&#145;Eight Letters&#146;, 523) to the court. In January 1718 he was one of three judges who gave their opinion against the king having the right to educate his grandchildren. He was again one of three judges made temporary commissioners of the great seal that year. He presided at the trial of Edward Arnold in 1724 for &#145;feloniously, maliciously and wilfully assaulting and discharging a loaded gun&#146;  (Baker, &#145;Mr Justice Tracy&#146;, 193) and thereby wounding Lord Onslow, &#145;against the form&#146; of the <span class="roman">Waltham Black Act</span> of 1723. Mention of the act made the shooting of Onslow potentially a capital offence. Arnold's defence rested on insanity and that the shooting could not be prosecuted within the terms of the <span class="roman">Black Act</span>, as he had not been disguised. Tracy left the first defence to the jury, who convicted Arnold on the basis that he was sane; but on the interpretation of the act he had consulted his colleagues and ruled that the clause in the act relating to malicious shooting was not related to the former clause concerning disguise. Tracy has been accused thereby of ensuring that the <span class="roman">Black Act</span> was divorced from its origins in an emergency and became part of &#145;the general armoury of repressive law&#146;  (Thompson, 210) but it has been argued in his defence that the statute was unambiguous in distinguishing its later provisions from those relating to disguise, and that Tracy was careful to interpret statute law and not overturn it.<br>
<br>In May 1725 Tracy was being talked of for promotion to lord chief baron or lord chief justice, but by December of that year it was rumoured that he would surrender his place in return for a pension. This duly occurred on 26 October 1726 with a pension of &pound;1500 p.a. He was then the youngest judge to be allowed to retire in this way. Tracy died at his &#145;new built house&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/673/217) at Coscomb, Gloucestershire, on 11 September 1735, and was buried in the local church at Didbrook. His two adult sons having predeceased him, in his will Tracy left his estate to his grandson Robert Tracy, remainder to his daughter Anne, the wife of Thomas Wylde MP, for life, then to his grandson Robert Pratt, the son of his daughter Dorothy and her husband, Sir John Pratt, the former lord chief justice.<br>
<br>Upon Tracy's death the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described him as &#145;a complete gentleman and a good lawyer; of a clear head and an honest heart, and delivered his opinion with that genteel affability and integrity that even those who lost a cause, were charmed with his behaviour&#146;. Dudley Ryder, on the other hand, confided to his diary his distaste for some of Tracy's judicial methods and for favouring certain attorneys that appeared before him.<br>
