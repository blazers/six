<span class="headword">Griffith,  John</span>  (1713&#150;1776), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born in Radnor on 21 July 1713, the son of John Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1745), and Amy, whose maiden name was possibly Morgan of Radnor. He was &#145;favoured with parents who had the substance of religion in themselves, and were conscientiously concerned to train up their children in the fear of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Life</span>, 14). His mother was a Quaker and Griffith records that she was &#145;a steady valuable Friend &hellip; having at times a few words, by way of testimony, tenderly to drop in religious meetings; which were acceptable to Friends&#146;  (ibid.). His father also became a member by convincement and, later, a minister among the Friends, who left &#145;a good report behind him among all sorts of people&#146;  (ibid., 15).<br>
<br>In his youth Griffith was inclined to fill his mind with &#145;vain, unprofitable, and sometimes wicked and blasphemous thoughts&#146; which were &#145;a great affliction to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Life</span>, 16). As a consequence, and in spite of his parents best intentions, he fell into bad company before embarking for America from Milford Haven in 1726, aged thirteen. He wrote in his journal that the passage took eight weeks, during which time three babies were born and none of the eighty to ninety passengers died. On his arrival in America he was greeted by his uncle John Morgan, who lived 12 miles from Philadelphia. Griffith then lodged with him while his brother, who presumably emigrated at the same time, lived with his aunt Mary Parnel and followed his trade as a weaver. Griffith at this time had not reformed his character and was prepared to &#145;gratify a vain mind in the foolish amusements of a transitory world&#146;, and attended Friends' meetings from habit rather than from conviction  (ibid., 19). He continued to act in such a manner until one of his companions came close to dying after a serious incident occurred in which Griffith was the ringleader. This had a dramatic effect upon his life, as he commented in his journal that his conversion &#145;struck them with some awe, for I observed they had not the boldness to mock or deride me before my face&#146;  (ibid., 24&#150;5).<br>
<br>In July 1734, when he was twenty-one, Griffith became a Quaker minister and gifted speaker at the Abingdon meeting in Pennsylvania. He remained faithful to his calling for the next forty-two years and began his first missionary journey around America in October 1736. On 30 December 1737 he married Rebekah Fearn (<i>d</i>. in or after 1750), the Quaker daughter of Josiah and Sarah Fearn, and settled at Lower Darby in Pennsylvania. He continued his missionary work, and in September 1741 he visited Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, where he was &#145;attacked divers times by some of them [Presbyterians] on religious subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Life</span>, 63). Griffith conducted further missionary work around America before he returned to Britain. During his voyage he was captured by a privateer and taken to Spain, and later to France, before escaping to England in 1748. While in Britain he visited his mother and close relatives in Radnor, he travelled to Ireland, and then he went back to Wales, where he had &#145;several large, though serviceable meetings amongst Friends, my old neighbours and acquaintances; their hearts being tendered and some much affected&#146;  (ibid., 204). In May 1750 Griffith returned to America but, following the death of his wife, he returned to England again, with his daughter, and settled at Chelmsford.<br>
<br>While at Chelmsford, Griffith met and married his second wife, Frances Wyatt, a Quaker minister, in January 1751. He continued his missionary visits around Britain, and in 1760 he helped to organize committees to visit Friends' meetings, which, coupled with his writings, prompted a revival in Quaker discipline. In July 1765 Griffith paid his last visit to America and attended large meetings of Friends in Pennsylvania. The following year he returned to England and, as a consequence of an asthmatic complaint, gave up his missionary work. On 17 June 1776 Griffith died, aged sixty-two, at Chelmsford and was buried at the Quaker burial-ground in the town on 23 June. He was survived by his wife. His most important works include <span class="italic">Brief Remarks upon Sundry Important Subjects, &amp;c.</span>, published posthumously in 1764, and his autobiography, <span class="italic">Journal of the Life, Travels and Labours in the Work of the Ministry of John Griffith</span>, which was first published in 1779.<br>
