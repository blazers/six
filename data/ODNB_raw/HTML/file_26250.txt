<span class="headword">Stanhope,  Leicester Fitzgerald Charles</span>, fifth earl of Harrington  (1784&#150;1862), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Dublin barracks on 2 September 1784, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26242/', "Charles Stanhope, third earl of Harrington (1753&#150;1829)")</script>, and his wife, Jane (1755&#150;1824), eldest daughter and coheir of Sir John Fleming, bt. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26243/', "Charles Stanhope, fourth earl")</script>. He entered the army in 1799 as a cornet. In 1803 he was promoted captain and in 1807 he served in South America. From 1815 to 1817 he was deputy adjutant-general in the East Indies and in 1816 was promoted major. From 1817 to 1821 he was deputy quartermaster-general in India. For his services in the Anglo-Maratha War of 1817&#150;18 he was created CB on 14 October 1818. In 1823 he was placed on half pay with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and became full colonel in 1837.<br>
<br>In 1813 Stanhope published his first pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Military Commentator</span>, which was critical of military law and particularly of the practice of flogging in the army. His 1823 <span class="italic">Sketch of the History and Influence of the Press in British India</span> was part of his campaign for press freedom in India, which ended in the suppression of the <span class="italic">Calcutta Journal</span> and the expulsion from India of its editor, James Silk Buckingham. He was a prominent critic of many of the policies of the East India Company.<br>
<br>Stanhope presented himself before the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95072', "London Greek Committee")</script> in 1823 as a liberal and a follower of Bentham and volunteered to be the committee's agent in Greece. The offer was accepted and he left in September 1823. Stanhope saw the Greeks as Eastern people, similar to the Indians with whom he was familiar. Referring to them as &#145;natives&#146; and &#145;children&#146;  (Rosen, 148, 149), Stanhope felt that they needed firm and authoritative guidance to set up an independent constitutional republic. These views brought him into conflict with most philhellenes, who had an idealized and romantic vision of the Greeks, and with many Greeks themselves, whose main aim was independence, not the establishment of a constitutional liberty.<br>
<br>In November 1823 Stanhope met Byron at Cefalonia, in the Ionian Islands, and the following month at Missolonghi, on the western approaches to the Gulf of Cornith, he met Mavrocordato, the leader of the western Greeks, whom most outsiders regarded as the natural leader of a new state, but whom Stanhope regarded as just one among many factional leaders and one misguidedly willing to consider the imposition on Greece of a foreign monarch. At Missolonghi Stanhope sought to establish schools and particularly a free press, and was dismayed and irritated by the lack of enthusiasm for these projects shown by Mavrocordato and his ally Byron. In 1824 Stanhope approached Odysseus, leader of the eastern Greeks, then in control of Athens, in the hope of uniting the Greek factions. Odysseus, described by St Clair as &#145;the most unusual Benthamite ever to burn a village or slit a throat&#146;  (St Clair, 191), responded readily, if insincerely. Stanhope used his time to establish a school and another newspaper, earning the nickname the Typographical Colonel. He hoped to bring the parties together at a conference in Salona, getting them to form a unified constitutional government to receive the first instalment of the committee's loan, thereby blocking Mavrocordato's plans to gain control over the loan. Mavrocordato was persuaded by Byron just before his death to attend the conference, but ultimately neither he nor Odysseus did. Canning recalled Stanhope, possibly in deference to requests by Turkey, or possibly because his actions were undermining the position of Mavrocordato, who was seen as Britain's main ally. He left for England from Zante on the <i>Florida</i> with Byron's body in May 1824, leaving the country in a state of chaos, the leaders divided, and the loan inaccessible in the hands of the bankers, since there was then no one in the country who could authorize its release.<br>
<br>Stanhope's letters to the Greek Committee were rapidly published as <span class="italic">Greece in 1823 and 1824</span> (1824) to try to answer the inevitable criticism. William Parry in <span class="italic">The Last Days of Lord Byron</span> (1825) saw Stanhope's antipathy to Byron as the root of the trouble, and this account made a lasting impression. Count Alerino Palma in <span class="italic">Greece Vindicated</span> (1826) pointed to the conflict between Stanhope and Edward Blaquiere, also in Greece on behalf of the London Greek committee, and found that Stanhope's conduct had increased the division among the Greeks and alienated many members of the London Greek Committee from the cause. There were also criticisms from Blaquiere himself and in the newspaper press. Stanhope's second edition of his book (1825) aimed to vindicate his actions. Rosen describes Stanhope as vain, arrogant, and condescending to all who disagreed with him, which cannot have helped matters, but attributes his actions to honestly held ideas, not, as has been claimed, those of Bentham, but ideas on how to build a modern European state and nation.<br>
<br>After his Greek adventure Stanhope settled down to a life of relative obscurity. On 23 April 1831 at St James's, Westminster, he married Elizabeth Williams (1810/11&#150;1898), daughter and heir of William Green of Trelawney, Jamaica. They had two daughters and two sons. Stanhope's elder brothers having died childless, in March 1851 he succeeded to the earldom of Harrington. In later life he was chiefly interested in temperance reform, on which subject he issued a pamphlet in 1858. He died at his home, Harrington House, Kensington Palace Gardens, London, on 7 September 1862. He was succeeded by his younger but only surviving son, Sidney Seymour Hide Stanhope, sixth earl of Harrington (1845&#150;1866).<br>
