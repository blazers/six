<span class="headword">Dane, Sir  Richard Morris</span>  (1854&#150;1940), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 21 May 1854, the third of four surviving sons of an Anglo-Irish family that was prominent in service in imperial India. His father was Richard Martin Dane (1813&#150;1901) of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who served in India and eventually became inspector-general of hospitals; his mother, Sophia Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffiths, came from a family long connected with India. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32705/', "Sir Louis William Dane")</script> was also to serve in India, and his own son, also Richard, served in the 1st Punjab cavalry. The bulk of Dane's career was spent in the Indian Civil Service, and it was here that he made a name for himself as an administrator of boundless confidence and exceptional vigour, who was painstaking in attention to detail, and unusual in his effectiveness.<br>
<br>Dane was educated at Dr Stackpole's school, Kingstown, Dublin, before passing the Indian Civil Service examination in 1872 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>]. After a probationary period he went out to Punjab province. While Dane was briefly attached to the foreign department of the government of India, his right eye was seriously injured in a polo match at Lahore. The lingering effects of the injury rendered his later accomplishments that much more impressive: although the eye was saved, he could not read for long periods without strain, and in order to continue shooting he taught himself to shoot from the left shoulder. While in England for medical attention following the accident he married, on 24 June 1880, Emily (1861/2&#150;1928), third daughter of Sir Edward Leeds, third baronet, a colonel in the Indian army. They had a son and two daughters, one of whom did not survive infancy. Dane divorced his wife in 1901 and she remarried in the following year.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1870s and 1880s Dane's career advanced with appointments that included under secretary to the government of the Punjab, boundary settlement officer in central India, and assistant commissioner at Ajmer. In 1890 he was promoted to commissioner of excise; from then on his most significant achievements were in the realm of tax, particularly salt tax, administration. He attracted wider attention, not all of it positive, when he aided Lord Brassey's royal commission on opium and contributed two lengthy historical appendices on the production of opium and the opium trade between India and China to the commission's final report (1895). These were an important component of the report, which found that the claims of the then quite vociferous anti-opium lobby were overstated, and that in any case the Indian government could not abolish the trade without instituting new and unpopular taxes in its stead. For his contribution to the final report Dane earned the opprobrium of the anti-opiumists, and was denounced in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Dane was made CIE in 1896 and continued his administrative career with appointments as secretary in the finance and commerce department, commissioner for salt revenue in north India in 1898, and eventually as the first inspector-general of excise and salt in 1907. During these years he developed and first attempted to implement his ideas on salt tax and administration. He believed that, in the realm of colonial finance, an indirect tax was always more popular than a direct tax, and that with unification of control, rationalization of administration, and the prevention of smuggling, a large revenue to the state and a lower tax on the people could be achieved simultaneously.<br>
<br>Although active as an administrator, and incessant in touring remote areas of India, Dane retired from the Indian Civil Service in 1909, in order to get in some years of hunting while his health remained good. He was made KCIE in the same year. Retirement was short lived. In 1913 the fledgeling post-imperial Chinese government and a consortium of banks then in the process of extending a controversially large loan (the &#145;reorganization loan&#146;) to the Chinese government invited Dane to China to reorganize the salt gabelle and put it on an administrative basis sound enough to service the ensuing annual loan debt. Knowing not a word of Chinese, but a good deal about rationalizing the salt tax administration, Dane arrived in China in 1913. Without preliminaries, he wrested for his newly created salt inspectorate an impressive degree of autonomy and set up a joint Sino-foreign administration that was organized on strict civil service principles of entry by examination and promotion by seniority. The Sino-foreign salt inspectorate was, from the very beginning, so untainted by corruption and so successful in terms of efficient tax collection that even after the reorganization loan debt service was paid, its annual surpluses continued to provide the second highest and most reliable source of tax to the Chinese government long after Dane departed from China in 1919. Indeed, the salt inspectorate, along with the customs administration formed by Sir Robert Hart in the previous century, embodied a set of principles that provided a working model of efficient, effective, and depoliticized administration. As such, it attracted a great deal of admiration from administrative reformers who wished to emulate it, and opprobrium from Chinese nationalists for whom the organization's links to the group banks reeked of imperialism. The salt inspectorate was taken into the nationalist government of Chaing Kai-shek in 1928, and continued to operate successfully along the principles originally articulated by Dane until some years after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War of 1937. Dane was rewarded by the Chinese government with the first class of the order of the Excellent Crop (1915) and of the Striped Tiger (1918).<br>
<br>After Dane left China he wrote an affectionate memoir of his hunting expeditions entitled <span class="italic">Sport in Asia and Africa</span> (1921); he retired to Herefordshire, where he remained active in salmon fishing into his eighties. He died at his home, Morney Cross, Fownhope, Herefordshire, on 13 February 1940.<br>
