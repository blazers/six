<span class="headword">Hadfield,  James</span>  (1771/2&#150;1841), <span class="occ">assailant of George III</span>, is of unknown parentage. Critically wounded at the battle of Roubaix in 1794, he sustained eight sabre wounds to his head before being captured by the French. After making his way back to England, he fell under the sway of a millenarian cult, becoming convinced that his death at the hands of the state would effect the second coming. Hadfield apparently reasoned that treason&#151;or even attempted treason&#151;would carry mortal punishment, and thus conspired with Bannister Truelock to assassinate George III at Drury Lane Theatre on the evening of 15 May 1800. As the king acknowledged the orchestra's playing of the national anthem, and the audience rose to its feet to welcome him, Hadfield climbed on a seat and fired a horse pistol at the royal box. The assailant's actual intention remains a mystery because when the king, unhurt, insisted on speaking to the soi-disant assassin, Hadfield greeted him by saying, &#145;God bless your royal highness; I like you very well; you are a good fellow&#146;  (Quen, 1221).<br>
<br>Despite such patriotic sentiment Hadfield was placed on trial for high treason, which although doubtless a dire prospect none the less entitled him to certain privileges not accorded the ordinary felon. Chief among these was the right to be represented by counsel, in this case perhaps the most brilliant attorney of his day, Thomas Erskine, the later lord chancellor. Erskine's task was extremely difficult since the common law required a complete derangement for an insanity acquittal: &#145;lost to all sense &hellip; incapable of forming a judgement upon the consequences of the act which he is about to do&#146;  (Moran, 499). Hadfield's ability to secure a firearm, place himself at the theatre in such a position to secure the best possible aim, and name the king as his intended target appeared to speak against any appearance of complete madness. Erskine wisely chose to confront directly the traditional criterion of total deprivation of memory and understanding. Could such a person even be capable of committing an act, criminal or otherwise? In place of a total derangement, Erskine asserted that delusion &#145;unaccompanied by frenzy or raving madness [was] the true character of insanity&#146;  (Eigen, 49). Hadfield's particular delusion, according to the attorney, stemmed unambiguously from his millenarian beliefs, even to the point of requiring death by the state. This characterization was reinforced by two surgeons and a physician who supplied a physical basis for the insanity&#151;brain damage due to war wounds&#151;and a mental consequence: Hadfield's belief that he was ordained to die in a manner that paralleled Christ's execution.<br>
<br>Following this unequivocal testimony, Lord Chief Justice Kenyon halted the trial, announcing to the court that the case &#145;was clearly an acquittal&#146; and that &#145;the prisoner, for his own sake, and for the sake of society at large, must not be discharged&#146;  (Walker, 78). The significance of Hadfield's acquittal in the evolving jurisprudence of criminal intent remains in question because there is no way of knowing whether the court found most persuasive Erskine's deft application of the defendant's delusory ideas to the attempted regicide, or the plain evidence of head trauma manifest in the still detectable sabre wounds to Hadfield's scalp. Nevertheless, Erskine succeeded in introducing the first form of partial insanity into the English criminal trial, challenging the notion that total derangement alone merited an acquittal. The verdict also had a lasting effect on the treatment of future insanity defendants. Prior to this case, defendants acquitted on the grounds of mental derangement were simply released to their families, their parish, or, most often, to no one in particular. Following the Hadfield verdict, parliament hastily passed the <span class="roman">Criminal Lunatics Act</span> of 1800, mandating that defendants acquitted on the grounds of insanity must be kept in strict custody until &#145;His Majesty's pleasure be known&#146;. After Hadfield, the special verdict &#145;not guilty by reason of insanity&#146; carried automatic and indefinite commitment to some sort of institution: one could be acquitted of a crime and still face life confinement, as Hadfield's experience vividly demonstrates.<br>
<br>Following his acquittal Hadfield remained locked in a cell for most of the remaining forty-one years of his life, an incarceration interrupted only for a short time when he escaped from Bethlem Hospital to be captured in Dover as he was about to flee to France. Subsequently taken to Newgate prison, Hadfield was finally transferred to the newly opened criminal department at Bethlem, where he averred &#145;the loss of liberty was worse than death&#146;  (Moran, 516). He died there of tuberculosis on 23 January 1841 aged sixty-nine.<br>
<br>Although Hadfield's acquittal did not result in a courtroom precedent to rival the 1843 McNaughtan rules, the introduction of delusion into courtroom testimony has had far-reaching, although perhaps not immediately obvious, effects. Erskine's invitation to the jury to broaden its conception of insanity to consider not just the beastly histrionics of raving mania, but the quietly methodical consequence of impelling ideas, blurred the lines separating total from partial insanity. Hadfield saw the world through a lens so profoundly distorted by a ruling delusion that even the act of regicide was not a moral wrong. Indeed, it was a moral duty. In consequence, jurors over the past two centuries have faced the dilemma of assigning criminality to an act that to any sane person would seem an unambiguous legal wrong, but which to the profoundly deluded represented no moral wrongdoing at all.<br>
