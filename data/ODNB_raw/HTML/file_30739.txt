<span class="headword">Betterton,  Henry Bucknall</span>, Baron Rushcliffe  (1872&#150;1949), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Woodville, Blackfordby, Leicestershire, on 15 August 1872, first son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Henry Inman Betterton (1844&#150;1895), JP and brewer, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Samuel Bucknall. Educated at Rugby School (1886&#150;90) and Christ Church, Oxford, he obtained a fourth class in modern history in 1893. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple at the age of twenty-four and practised as a lawyer for twenty years. On 19 December 1912 he married Violet, widow of Captain Hervey Greathed of the 8th hussars, and daughter of John Saunders Gilliat, formerly governor of the Bank of England. They had two daughters. Betterton was appointed OBE in 1918 and CBE in 1920 for his services as a member of the advisory board of the war trade intelligence department during the war. He entered politics as the Conservative member for the Rushcliffe division of Nottinghamshire in December 1918. He was parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour during the Conservative administrations of 1923 and 1924&#150;9 and was created a baronet in July 1929. In August 1931 Betterton was appointed minister for labour in the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald. It was during his three years in this role that Betterton made his most significant contribution to the shape of British government.<br>
<br>After earlier being a determined opponent of the centralization of unemployment relief, Neville Chamberlain, the chancellor of the exchequer, in 1932 proposed the creation of a new statutory commission which would take national control of the assessment and payment of relief for the able-bodied unemployed, taking away the powers previously held by local government. Despite this proposal generally being enthusiastically received within government, Betterton stood out in opposition, and for over a year he &#145;fought a dogged rearguard action&#146; through the cabinet committee structure to change Chamberlain's plans  (Lowe, 159). His criticisms were both practical and philosophical, but his main objection was that unemployment was an industrial problem and should be treated as such, while the new scheme simply &#145;applied Poor Law methods, through a Poor Law Commission, in Poor Law language&#146;  (Marquand, 733). Betterton, it has been said, was &#145;on excellent terms with labour's left wing&#146;  (Lowe, 35) and was &#145;sympathetic to the objections raised by the socialists regarding the &#147;means test&#148;&#146; and its use in unemployment relief  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Nov 1949, 7). Betterton argued strongly for the principle, which was important in the development of later welfare structures, of distinguishing between the needs and treatment of those out of work for industrial reasons and those requiring support because of sickness, old age, or other factors. In this he received the support of MacDonald, and on a number of points in cabinet &#145;Betterton inflicted on Chamberlain a series of rare defeats&#146;  (Lowe, 155). Betterton took through parliament the amended proposal as the <span class="roman">Unemployment Act</span> of 1934, and in June 1934 resigned from parliament to become the first chairman of the Unemployment Assistance Board established by the act, where he remained until 1941.<br>
<br>Betterton's character and his response to the needs of the unemployed in the years of economic depression were suggested by the fulsome praise he later received from both Labour and Liberal opponents. Viscount Addison said the labour movement &#145;had known him as a most sympathetic Minister of Labour in an exceedingly trying period&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1949, 6). The Liberal Viscount Samuel described him as &#145;a man of benevolent mind, boundless good will, and unremitting devotion to the public service&#146;  (ibid.). In January 1935 he was created Baron Rushcliffe of Blackfordby, and in 1941 he was appointed GBE. He had been sworn of the privy council in 1931. Rushcliffe served on many committees and was chairman of the one which in 1943 determined an improved wage scale for British nurses which became known as the Rushcliffe scale. Addison said the nurses of Britain owed Rushcliffe &#145;a great debt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1949, 11). He was also active as chairman, from 1944, of the special committee on legal aid and legal advice, whose recommendations were broadly enacted in the 1949 <span class="roman">Legal Aid and Advice Act</span>, which introduced the modern system of legal aid.<br>
<br>Rushcliffe's first wife died in 1947. In April 1948 he married Inez Alfreda, Lady Snagge (<i>d</i>. 1955), whose first marriage had been dissolved, and who was the daughter of Alfred Lubbock of Par, Cornwall. They had no children. Rushcliffe died on 18 November 1949 at his home, The Gables, Blatchington Hill, Seaford, Sussex.<br>
