<span class="headword">York,  Aaron  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1268), <span class="occ">financier and administrator</span>, was the son of Josce of Lincoln. Although born in Lincoln, probably before 1190, Aaron seems to have been living in York in 1210, when he was assessed for the so-called Bristol tallage. He must, therefore, have been among the early immigrants who re-established a Jewish community at York in the wake of the massacre of 1190. By 1221 his father and brothers Benedict and Samuel had also moved to York, where Aaron had become one of the leading moneylenders in the city. Working often in partnership with other lenders, Aaron lent large sums to important people, especially in the north, where he also enjoyed profitable relationships with a number of monastic houses. At York he presided over a family consortium that included Leo and Samuel l'Eveske, the father and brother of his wife, Hannah; his nephews Josce le Jovene and Isaac; and his brothers Benedict and Samuel. During the 1220s this consortium emerged as the largest supplier of credit to the rapidly expanding economy of Yorkshire. Aaron himself seems to have done a particularly brisk business in lending to Yorkshire monastic houses, who were expanding both the size of their sheep flocks and the extent of their agricultural property during this decade. By the 1230s Aaron's business connections reached into almost every shire in England. In February 1236 Henry III appointed him to sit at the Jewish exchequer, and in December of that year he became archpresbyter, the royally appointed administrative head of the English Jewish community. From this position he was able to further extend his business empire, and to increase his lending around the court. At a time of increasing royal taxation, however, his position also made him an object of hostility, both at court and in the Jewish community. In 1243 the king dismissed him from the archpresbyterate in favour of Elias l'Eveske. No grounds for his dismissal from office are known.<br>
<br>In 1241 Aaron's estate was valued for purposes of taxation at &pound;40,000. Toward the Jewish tallage of 20,000 marks of that year, he paid 6000 marks (&pound;4000). No other thirteenth-century English Jew approached this level of wealth. Between 1241 and 1255, however, royal taxation and other exactions consumed his entire fortune. Aaron told the chronicler Matthew Paris that between 1243 and 1250 he paid the king 30,000 marks, and a further 200 gold marks to the queen. The figures are credible. Despite his losses he remained, nevertheless, the dominant financial figure in the English Jewish community throughout the 1240s, and made further substantial payments to the crown in the early 1250s. By 1255, however, his business had collapsed. Unable to keep up with his tallage payments, his collectable bonds were transferred to the crown, further undermining his financial situation. He, his wife, and his children were several times imprisoned during these years, sometimes for his own debts, on other occasions because Aaron was acting as surety for the debts of the entire Jewish community. King Henry also imposed a variety of personal indignities upon him, most famously in 1251 when he ordered that Aaron's prize black palfrey be confiscated, without compensation, as a gift for Robert Passelewe (<i>d</i>. 1252). Charges of falsifying charters also began to be brought against Aaron, prompting further payments to the crown to avoid prosecution. Although Aaron was still able to pay part of his tallage assessment for spring 1255, when a second tallage of &pound;1000 was imposed upon the English Jewish community in November, he was unable to pay his assessment of &pound;100, and was exempted from the tax on grounds of poverty.<br>
<br>After 1255 references to Aaron of York become scarce. His nephew Isaac continued to act as his attorney as Aaron liquidated the remnants of his financial empire. In 1265 Aaron's wife, Hannah, inherited some property from her brother Samuel, but the family continued to sell assets. In 1266 Aaron sold his remaining property in London to Rabbi Elijah Menahem (<i>d</i>. 1284). Aaron died in 1268, before 30 August, leaving property in Oxford, Northampton, and York to his heirs. But this too was liquidated in the following decade. In 1280 Hannah and her younger son, Elias, sold their share of the family property on Coney Street in York. Samuel, Aaron's elder son, moved to London, and in 1281 he too sold his Coney Street property. No further references to Hannah, Samuel, or Elias are known. Aaron and Hannah also had a daughter, Auntera, whose first husband was her cousin Isaac, the son of Josce le Jovene. Her second husband, Lumbard, was hanged for coinage offences in 1279 or 1280.<br>
