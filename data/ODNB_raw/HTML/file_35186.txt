<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nash,  Paul</span>  (1889&#150;1946), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London on 11 May 1889, the elder son of William Harry Nash (<i>d</i>. 1929), barrister and recorder of Abingdon, and his first wife, Caroline Maude (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of Captain Milbourne Jackson RN. His father's family came from Buckinghamshire farming stock, his mother's belonged to the navy, for which he was at first intended. But, with the capacity of any artist to fail where his heart is not engaged, Nash did not pass the entrance examination and so returned to finish his schooling at St Paul's School, London, which he left at seventeen. He avoided the alternative careers of architecture and banking, and pursued his interests in black and white illustration. After a short time at Chelsea Polytechnic school of art (1906&#150;8) and then at night school at Bolt Court (the London County Council School of Photo-Engraving and Lithography), Nash went, with the encouragement of William Rothenstein, to the Slade School of Fine Art in 1910. He learned little there and left after a year. His earliest work was from his imagination, stimulated by the art and poetry of William Blake and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the work of later Pre-Raphaelites, the early W. B. Yeats, and the plays of Gordon Bottomley, who encouraged him and became his friend. Nash earned modest fees from designing bookplates in a late arts and crafts style, and tried his hand, without obvious success, as a poet.<br>
<br>Unlike some of his contemporaries at the Slade School&#151;Mark Gertler, C. R. W. Nevinson, William Roberts, and Edward Wadsworth&#151;Nash remained uninfluenced by the two post-impressionist exhibitions organized by Roger Fry in 1910 and 1912. One day the painter Sir William Richmond said to him, &#145;My boy, you should go in for Nature&#146;  (Nash, 105). He did, looking at it more directly, and drawing it on the spot. The &#145;nature&#146; that he went in for, although usually without human beings, was always peopled, if not by the &#145;star-inwrought&#146; visions of his youth, then by what Nash himself many years later called the <i>genius loci</i>: something which was not at first formal, but evanescent, a quality of light and imagination, and which later developed a fantastic, tangible personality expressed most fully by the monoliths and monster trees of his later work.<br>
<br>Nash had his first one-man show, of ink and wash drawings, at the prestigious Carfax Gallery, London, in 1912, and in 1913 shared an exhibition at the Dorien Leigh Gallery with his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31486/', "John Northcote Nash")</script>. In 1914 Nash married Margaret Theodosia (<i>d</i>. 1960), daughter of Naser Odeh, formerly priest in charge of St Mary's mission and the pro-cathedral, Cairo; there were no children. At the outbreak of war he enlisted in the Artists' Rifles; in 1916 he was commissioned in the Hampshire regiment and by March 1917 was in the Ypres salient. After four months he was invalided home as the result of an accident, but during those months he had spent all his time making drawings which were shown at the Goupil Gallery. Strongly recommended by supporters including William Rothenstein and Edward Marsh, Nash was appointed an official war artist under the newly initiated scheme run by the department of information under John Buchan (later Lord Tweedsmuir). Nash returned to the front as an official artist in November 1917 in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Passchendaele. The drawings he made then, of shorn trees in ruined and flooded landscapes, were the works that made Nash's reputation. They were shown at the Leicester Galleries in 1918 together with his first efforts at oil painting, in which he was self-taught and quickly successful, though his drawings made in the field had more immediate public impact. From April of that year until early in 1919 Nash was engaged on paintings commissioned by the department of information for the newly established Imperial War Museum, of which the largest and most famous is <span class="italic">The Menin Road</span>. Nash, who had also worked alongside the Canadian forces at Vimy Ridge, was among the select group of artists which was also commissioned to make a large painting for the Canadian war records (<span class="italic">A Night Bombardment</span>, National Gallery of Canada). His poetic imagination, instead of being crushed by the terrible circumstances of war, had expanded to produce terrible images&#151;terrible because of their combination of detached, almost abstract, appreciation and their truth to appearance.<br>
<br>Nash's first note for his autobiography for the years following 1918 was &#145;Struggles of a war artist without a war&#146;  (Nash, 218). Disoriented, at first, and uncertain how to capitalize on success gained as a result of events people wanted to put behind them, Nash, over the following years, illustrated books, designed costumes and scenery for Sir James Barrie's <span class="italic">The Truth about the Russian Dancers</span>, was for a short time an instructor in design at the Royal College of Art, and became a leader of the revival of wood-engraving. Two important British illustrated books of the decade were Nash's <span class="italic">Places</span> (1922), landscape wood-engravings accompanied by brief prose poems, and his <span class="italic">Genesis</span> (1924) for the Nonesuch Press. It was in this decade that Nash evolved his characteristic watercolour style, his debts to C&eacute;zanne in no way concealing the depth of his kinship with the British watercolour tradition back to the eighteenth century. As an oil painter Nash developed differently, assimilating now the lessons of post-impressionism that had passed him by earlier on, as well as more recent achievements of the Paris school. But his sharp and often high-keyed colours are his own, and though Nash felt now the need to broaden his understanding of contemporary painting, he never permitted his own personality to become obscured.<br>
<br>In 1919 Nash moved to Dymchurch in Kent, beginning his well-known series of pictures of the sea, the breakwaters, and the long wall that prevents the sea from flooding Romney Marsh. Dymchurch wall and the marsh extending as far behind as the eye could see, with its dykes, culverts, and sheep pens, made an indelible impression on him, and he returned as late as 1937 to rework major Dymchurch designs such as <span class="italic">Winter Sea</span> (York City Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">Dymchurch Steps</span> (National Gallery of Canada). Nash also continued to paint the friendlier landscapes of his native territory, the Chilterns. He developed the flower-like forms that distinguish his later pictures, and also the study of trees, especially beechwoods, whose sun-crossed verticals inspired the structure of his near-abstract work, then just begun but in the next decade to be explored further. A second exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1924 confirmed Nash among the two or three leaders of British painting, while a third and particularly successful show at the same gallery in 1928 stimulated this increasingly self-critical artist to recognize that the formulae developed since 1918 would become a handicap unless he took greater risks, set himself new tasks, and explored areas of modern continental art that had bypassed England in the atmosphere of post-war cultural retrenchment.<br>
<br>From 1929 changes were evident in Nash's painting that were to lead him further towards abstraction, a direction Nash ultimately admitted he was unsuited to. He also explored the metaphysical art of the Italian Giorgio de Chirico, a highly productive encounter which was to lead him towards his own personal version of surrealism. His understanding of modern art in Paris was greatly stimulated by incursions into art criticism, writing in the early thirties for the <span class="italic">Listener</span> and the <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span>. Though he soon tired of regular criticism, Nash became a distinguished essayist, writing for the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, and other journals up to the outbreak of the Second World War. His eye for the quirky character of out-of-the-way places, and the expression in his articles of feeling for the severe classicism of the best British design, connecting Adam and Chippendale with the modern movement, reflect his keen perception of the character of British taste. Nash's <span class="roman">Shell Guide</span> to <span class="italic">Dorset</span> (1936), one of the first to be commissioned by John Betjeman for the series he edited for Shell-Mex, showed Nash's skill in reading the past through architectural survivals and the lineaments of the landscape.<br>
<br>The ten years from 1929 to the Second World War brought a new freedom in the different areas of Nash's many activities. He travelled to America (as British representative on the jury of the Carnegie International Exhibition, 1931) and in Europe (though his English roots seem to have left him always a little uneasy abroad). In 1933 Nash founded <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96310', "Unit One")</script>, the group of experimental painters, sculptors, and architects which included Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, and Wells Coates among others. He was president of the Society of Industrial Artists, 1932&#150;4, on the committee of the first International Surrealist Exhibition (London, New Burlington Galleries, 1936), had exhibitions at the Redfern and Leicester galleries, and showed at the Venice Biennale in 1938. During all this time he designed fabrics, posters (notably for Shell-Mex), book jackets, endpapers, and so on, the execution of which he always supervised with scrupulous care. Nash began using a camera in 1931 both as a way of recording ideas for possible pictures and as images and compositions that gave pleasure in themselves. During this time he struggled with increasingly serious ill health due to asthma, for which he tried living at Rye, Swanage in Dorset, and in Hampstead, where he stayed until the outbreak of war. In 1930 he had begun his illustrations for Sir Thomas Browne's <span class="italic">Urne Buriall</span> and <span class="italic">The Garden of Cyrus</span>. Sir Herbert Read has stressed how much Browne and Nash were akin in spirit. It was Nash's metaphysical wit combined with his odd, rather bookish sense of visual incongruities that led him to adopt his highly personal attitude to surrealism. For him, surrealism was less an international movement than a licence to paint as he chose within the terms of modern practice. Because he was neither mordant nor rebellious his work had none of the shock tactics of continental surrealism but retained the sweetness of the English landscape, the uncertainties of the English weather, and the whimsicalities of a cultivated English mind. His excursions into abstract painting had the same personal characteristics.<br>
<br>Nash was fascinated by evidence of prehistory, stones and mounds in fields, and in the personalities of natural stones and flowers and twisted tree roots, and dwelt upon them both in his painting and in his writing. He started in 1937 an autobiography which was published posthumously, in 1949, as <span class="italic">Outline</span>. It traces the course of his life only to 1914; it is much concerned with the magic of childhood, and the travails as well as the excitements of growing up and facing the world. He saw 1914 and the war as a caesura, the close of an era. <span class="italic">Outline</span> is a perfect vignette and it is not perhaps surprising that Nash never took the story further. He wrote with elegance and heart; his observations of himself and others were shrewd, humorous, and searching. He was a witty man who could also inspire wit in others since his rapturous reception of remarks sharpened people's intelligence when talking to him. No nuance was lost.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1939 Nash, though already a very sick man, was unwilling to forgo the kind of public role he had had in the First World War, or to retreat from positions of leadership which he felt it the duty of the experienced and successful to offer to younger men. He moved to Oxford, living at 106 Banbury Road, opened a bureau to help artists find the least wasteful kinds of work for their capabilities, and became a war artist to the Air Ministry, later transferring to the Ministry of Information. This war disturbed Nash but did not change his art as the last one had. His style and his habits were formed, and in the new war he treated his new subjects as he had treated those he had been thinking about for so long. His late paintings, both oils and watercolours, are alternately brilliant and sombre in colour with the light of setting suns and rising moons spreading over wooded and hilly landscapes. Not many of his new war paintings bear any relation to the desolate wastes of 1917, among the few being <span class="italic">Totes Meer</span> (Tate collection), a sea of broken, twisted German aeroplane wrecks on a dump outside Oxford. The disparity was partly due to the different nature of the wars, but much more to the fact that in 1917 the whole of his outraged inexperience was at the service of the war, whereas in 1940 the war was made to serve his experience. Aeroplanes were domesticated to his canvas as tree trunks or stones had been between the wars. Such an attitude was by then an artist's only remedy, his only chance of survival. On the whole, his official patrons were disappointed by his poetical aeroplanes. His last works were of flowers, in particular sunflowers, and landscapes, and giant flowers dominating landscapes.<br>
<br>Nash had a noteworthy sense of order and of the niceties of presentation; his pictures were beautifully framed, drawings mounted, his studio precisely and decoratively tidy, and oddments which he collected were worked up into compositions (found objects). In his life his sense of fitness extended, even on the most ordinary occasions, to his clothes. His scarf and dressing gown in the morning would be fit for a play; his suits and his ties, matched, brushed, and pressed as though by a valet. All this with his black hair, brilliant blue eyes, and fine profile made him seem a very exquisite person. But his features never stayed put, to be admired; they were mobile, sensitive to atmosphere and&#151;this was his saving grace&#151;ironical. Nash died at 35 Boscombe Spa Road, Bournemouth, on 11 July 1946 and was buried on 17 July in Langley church, Buckinghamshire.<br>
