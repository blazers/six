<span class="headword">Onslow,  Muriel  Wheldale</span>  (1880&#150;1932), <span class="occ">plant biochemist</span>, was born on 31 March 1880 at Round Hills, Aston Manor, Warwickshire, the only child of John Wheldale, solicitor, and his wife, Fannie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hayward). From King Edward VI High School for Girls, Birmingham, she entered Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1900, and, exceptionally well prepared, took a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1902 and a first class in part two (botany) in 1904.<br>
<br>Wheldale's early research was strongly influenced by the Cambridge geneticist William Bateson. Supported first by a Bathurst fellowship and then by a six-year Newnham College research fellowship (or &#145;N&#146; fellowship), she investigated inheritance of flower colour in the snapdragon, <i>Antirrhinum majus</i>; the work led her directly into the biochemistry (particularly the biosynthesis) of the pigments involved, the anthocyanins. Her isolation and chemical examination of these compounds about 1913&#150;14 was pioneering and preceded the publication of the classic work in this area by German chemist Richard Willst&auml;tter. The application of chemical and physical methods to the unravelling of the complexities of biological systems was then in its infancy, and she was one of the first to offer an acceptable discussion of the factors of inheritance from a chemical point of view. Her monograph <span class="italic">The Anthocyanin Pigments of Plants</span> (1916; rev. edn, 1925), an account of current research on these compounds, their distribution, and theories about their biological function, solidly established her reputation in the field. From about 1919 she concentrated on investigations of the nature of oxidizing enzymes present in higher plants, particularly oxidase, a catalyst involved in pigment production. In addition, she worked with the Food Investigation Board; from 1922 she supervised a team carrying out research on cold storage problems of apples at the Cambridge Low Temperature Research Station.<br>
<br>From 1911 to 1914 Wheldale was a member of the Bateson genetics group at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Merton, Surrey, but most of her career was spent at Cambridge, in the botany school and in the biochemical department, which, under the leadership of F. G. Hopkins, afforded opportunities for a remarkable number of women at a time when few positions permitting independent research in the chemical sciences were within their reach. She taught at Newnham in 1911&#150;12 and held an assistantship in the university physiological (later biochemical) laboratory from 1918 to 1926. Among the most distinguished of early women biochemists, she was one of the first women appointed to a Cambridge University lectureship (in biochemistry, 1926). She was an inspiring teacher with a gift for clear exposition; her class in plant biochemistry was an important unit in the advanced botany curriculum.<br>
<br>On 3 February 1919 she married a colleague, Victor Alexander Herbert Huia Onslow (1890&#150;1922), second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35317/', "William Hillier Onslow, fourth earl of Onslow")</script>, governor of New Zealand; there were no children. Despite formidable physical disability, her husband was active in biochemical research, and she collaborated with him closely from about 1917 until his death, concentrating largely on the problem of colour and iridescence in insect scales.<br>
<br>In addition to <span class="italic">Anthocyanin Pigments</span> and about twenty original papers on plant pigments and oxidase systems, Wheldale Onslow wrote two textbooks, <span class="italic">Practical Plant Biochemistry</span> (1920), a general survey of problems in the chemistry of plant life, solidly grounded in organic chemistry, and <span class="italic">Principles of Plant Biochemistry</span> (1931), the first volume of a projected two-volume work whose second volume was not completed before her death.<br>
<br>Though somewhat critical and self-contained by nature Wheldale Onslow was, to those who passed through her reserve, a pleasant and witty companion and a constant friend. She much enjoyed travel, and during her last years explored many of the more inaccessible parts of central Europe. Her Cambridge home was shared with her widowed mother, whose sole companion she was for a number of years. She died at the height of her professional success at her home, 1 Clare Road, Cambridge, on 19 May 1932. Her funeral service was held on the 23rd at Madingley church. A Newnham prize and research fellowship commemorate her name.<br>
