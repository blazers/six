<span class="headword">Dodd,  James Solas</span>  (1720/21&#150;1805), <span class="occ">surgeon and actor</span>, was born in London, the son of Jago Mendozo Vasconcellos de Solis, and his wife, Rebecca, daughter of John Dodd. John Dodd was in 1719 commander of the <i>St Quintin</i>, a merchantman trading from London to Barcelona. At Barcelona he became acquainted with Don Jago, who, having had a duel with the son of the governor of Barcelona and left him for dead, took refuge in Dodd's ship, and sailed in it for London the same evening. Don Jago lodged at Captain Dodd's house and in 1720 married his host's daughter. On his marriage Don Jago took the name of Dodd in order to bequeath to his children a small estate near Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1727 Don Jago died in London, having failed to reconcile his father, Don Gaspard de Solis, to his marriage with a protestant, by which he lost his patrimony and commission.<br>
<br>Young Dodd received a good education, as it was his mother's wish that he should enter the church, but, in 1742, &#145;on some family reasons&#146; he was apprenticed to John Hills, a surgeon practising in the Minories, London. In 1745 Dodd entered the navy as surgeon's mate of the hospital ship <i>Blenheim</i> and served until the end of the war in the <i>Devonshire</i> and the <i>St Albans</i>. He continued for some months after the peace in the <i>St Albans</i>, then stationed at Plymouth. Dodd took up his diploma as a member of the Company of Surgeons, London, in 1751, and practised in Gough Square, Fleet Street, and afterwards in Suffolk Street, Haymarket. In 1752 he published <span class="italic">An Essay towards a Natural History of the Herring</span>, written to promote the industry on the behalf of the Society of the Free British Fishery. He was indebted to Dr Thomas Birch for assistance in his literary projects  (Dodd, his letter to Birch, 14 April 1752, BL, Add. MS 4305, fol. 2). The next year he took part in the great Canning controversy by publishing <span class="italic">A physical account of the case of Elizabeth Canning, with an enquiry into the probability of her subsisting in the manner therein asserted</span> (1753), in which he argues strongly for the truth of the girl's story. Towards the close of January 1754, &#145;on account of some deaths in his family&#146;, Dodd set out for the continent, returning in the following May. In 1759 he again entered the navy: &#145;came as supernumerary in the <i>Sheerness</i> from Leghorn to Gibraltar&#146;; there he went on board the <i>Prince</i>, and served on her until June 1762. In the same year he qualified at Surgeons' Hall as master surgeon of any ship of the first rate, and was warranted for the <i>Hawke</i>, in which he served until she was paid off at the peace in February 1763. He then settled once more in London, &#145;chiefly&#146;, as he says, &#145;in the literary line&#146;.<br>
<br>One of Dodd's literary undertakings was a series of lectures first delivered in 1766 in the great room of Exeter Exchange, and afterwards published with the title <span class="italic">A Satyrical Lecture on Hearts, to which is Added a Critical Dissertation on Noses</span> (1767). The reviewer of the book in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>  (37, 1767, 73&#150;4) attributes to Dodd the authorship of a periodical essay published some years before under the title of &#145;The scourge&#146;. On 7 February 1767 the house in which he lodged, adjoining the gateway of the Saracen's Head inn on Snow Hill, suddenly collapsed, but he and his family escaped with the loss only of their belongings. His wife's health being affected by this accident, Dodd left London and went to Bath and Bristol in order to hasten her recovery; from there he wandered to Ireland, where he &#145;followed his business and literary employments&#146; in Dublin. In Ireland, Dodd published his <span class="italic">Essays and Poems</span> (1770) which claimed to contain &#145;A collection of all the Airs, Catches, Glees, Cantatas, and Roundelays &hellip; performed at Stratford upon Avon, on occasion of the Jubilee &hellip; in honour of Shakespeare&#146; in 1769. The book also contains a first-hand account of the jubilee. On 9 October 1769 Dodd was engaged by William Parsons, manager of the Birmingham Theatre, to re-read Garrick's <span class="italic">Jubilee Ode to Shakespeare</span>  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). In March 1779 Dodd was invited to return to London. He brought with him a play, <span class="italic">The Funeral Pile</span> (originally entitled <span class="italic">Gallic Gratitude</span>), based largely on <span class="italic">Le naufrage</span> of Joseph de Lafont, which had just two performances at Covent Garden (30 April and 19 May 1779).<br>
<br>In 1781 Dodd became friendly with a Major John Savage, who styled himself Baron Weildmester, and had, he alleged, a number of claims on Lord North. Savage, on promising to defray all expenses, persuaded Dodd and his family to travel with him to Russia, where, he said, he had a plan to propose to the empress from a foreign power to enter into a treaty of alliance, and that he and Dodd were to act as ambassadors; Savage also proposed &#145;that Mrs. Dodd, &amp;c. should remain under the czarina's protection, and that on their return they would be decorated with the order of St. Catherine &amp; have 1,000<i>l</i>. a year pension&#146;. Charmed with this proposal Dodd cheerfully bore the expense until Riga was reached, where he learned Savage's true character. Dodd soon joined a ship bound for Bowness on the Firth of Forth. He landed at Leith in December 1781 almost penniless. In the following year he appeared at Edinburgh as actor and lecturer. David Stewart Erskine, eleventh earl of Buchan, was interested in him, and among Buchan's manuscripts is a paper in Dodd's handwriting relating the story of his career from his earliest years. A verbatim transcript is given in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, 6th series, 7, 1883, 483&#150;4. In 1786 a marriage licence was granted to Dodd and Ann Hurley Mason. Dodd died in Mecklenburgh Street, Dublin, in the spring of 1805, aged eighty-four. John O'Keeffe wrote in his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> that Dodd's &#145;learning and general knowledge were great; and though he had but small wit himself, [he] delighted to find it in another. He turned actor but was indifferent at that trade. He was a lively smart little man, with a cheerful laughing face&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
