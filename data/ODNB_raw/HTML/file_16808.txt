<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Livingston <span class="st"> [Livingstone]</span>,  James</span>, first earl of Callendar  (<em>d.</em> 1674), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of Alexander Livingston, first earl of Linlithgow (<i>d</i>. 1621), and Helen Hay, daughter of Andrew Hay, earl of Erroll.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Livingston was probably born in the 1590s, and enlisted in the Dutch service, being lieutenant of a company commanded by his elder brother, Sir Henry Livingston, in 1618. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel of one of the three regiments of the Scottish brigade in the Netherlands in 1629, and colonel in 1633. That his early career also saw service to the British crown is indicated by the facts that he was granted a pension by James VI and that by 1628 he had been knighted, being referred to by Charles I as one who &#145;has been soe long abroad in our service beyond sea&#146;  (C. Rogers, ed., <span class="italic">The Earl of Stirling's Register of Royal Letters</span>, 2 vols., 1885, 1.326). The following year he is mentioned as a gentleman of the king's privy chamber, and when Charles I visited Scotland in 1633 he was created Lord Livingston of Almond (Amont) on 19 June.<h2>
<a name="Thebishopswars"></a>The bishops' wars</h2>Lord Almond was one of those sent to Scotland in 1638 by Charles I to encourage opposition to the covenanters; he was admitted to the privy council there on 2 July, but his loyalties proved uncertain. Almond signed the &#145;king's covenant&#146;, intended to rival the national covenant, on 22 September, but in December joined others in declaring that he understood it as upholding presbyterianism, the opposite of the king's intention. In the first bishops' war of 1639 the covenanters expected that Almond would accept appointment as second in command of their forces, but &#145;in the tyme of our most need, the grievousness of his gravell, or the pretence of it, made him goe to France to be cutted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.212). He had sought treatment for the stone previously, at Harrogate in 1637, but suspicion that his illness was a pretext to avoid having to take sides in the conflict was heightened when, after he found that he did not need to be &#145;cut&#146;, he proceeded to Holland to take command of his regiment there instead of returning to Scotland. However, the covenanters having been successful in their defiance of the king in 1639, Almond agreed to serve as their lieutenant-general in the second bishops' war of 1640. He played a leading role in the Scottish army's advance into England, which led to victory at the battle of Newburn and the occupation of Newcastle, but just before the campaign had begun he had signed the Cumbernauld bond with the earl of Montrose and others, indicating opposition to the policies of the earl of Argyll and other covenanting leaders. In spite of the discovery of the bond and the denunciation of its signatories Almond retained his military command, as the covenanters did not want to emphasize division in their ranks, and perhaps because Argyll remained &#145;to that man a most speciall friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.390).<br>
<br>Support for the covenanters lost Almond his Dutch command for, evidently at the request of Charles I, he was replaced as colonel of his regiment on 5 November 1640. When Charles was negotiating a settlement with the covenanters in 1641 he still had sufficient hopes of Almond's loyalty to propose his appointment as treasurer of Scotland, but Argyll took a lead in blocking the proposal, indicating that public good came before private friendship. That the covenanters' doubts about Almond's reliability were justified was confirmed in October by &#145;the Incident&#146;, a plot whereby a group of royalist officers planned a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>. Proposals to arrest the earl of Argyll and the marquess of Hamilton were alleged to have been made in Almond's house, and he was said to have been assigned a leading part in seizing the two nobles. However, the matter was not investigated too closely, as both king and covenanters were determined not to let the affair prevent them reaching an agreement. As part of the settlement Almond was created earl of Callendar on 6 October 1641.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinScotlandandEngland16431647dividedloyalties"></a>Service in Scotland and England, 1643&#150;1647: divided loyalties</h2>In spite of Callendar's flirtations with royalists in 1640&#150;41 the new earl's military reputation was sufficient for the covenanters to offer him the position of lieutenant-general again in 1643, when they were moving towards alliance with the English parliament against the king in the English civil war, even though some still doubted his commitment to the cause. Early in 1644 he was involved in the plottings of royalists with malcontent army officers for risings in favour of the king. According to James Turner he &#145;persuaded me in his oune house of Callendar, and upon a Lords day [Sunday] too, that he would faithfullie serve the King&#146;, and swore oaths to that effect  (Turner, 36). But on 16 May he accepted a commission to serve the covenanters as lieutenant-general, commanding in chief all forces being raised in Scotland. This meant that the marquess of Argyll, who was to command an expedition being sent north against the royalist rising led by Sir John Gordon of Haddo, came technically under Callendar's command. Callendar's insistence on this arrangement may not have been merely a squabble about rank, but a reflection of hopes of his that having Argyll, the covenanters' political leader, under his military command could help him to divert the new army from fighting against to fighting for the king. Certainly he continued to assure Turner of his loyalty to Charles I, and that high rank among the covenanters would increase his ability to help him. However, his manoeuvrings look more like the fumblings of an ambitious man seeking to keep open the option of changing sides if events made that expedient than those of a man of firm loyalty to any cause.<br>
<br>Callendar's forces were first used to police the border, to prevent incursions of royalists from the north of England, such as that led by Montrose in April 1644. However, when it turned out that the main Scottish army in England, engaged in the siege of York, was unable to suppress the activities of Montrose and other royalists in northern England, Callendar was sent into England with his army, 7000 to 10,000 strong, on 25 June. He reasserted Scottish military control of the north-east, and was joined in the siege of Newcastle by the main Scottish army in England in August. On the victory of Montrose at Tippermuir, near Perth, on 1 September, Callendar's army was at first ordered to return to Scotland, but the covenanters' determination to give priority to the war in England led to the orders being countermanded. Callendar was then offered command of another new army being raised in Scotland, to pursue Montrose, but chose to remain in England, where he took part in the storming of Newcastle on 19 October.<br>
<br>In January 1646 there were renewed demands that Callendar return to Scotland to direct action against the royalists in the north, and thus take up the duties envisaged in his 1644 commission as commander of the forces within the country, but his demands for authority over all other commanders were rejected on this occasion, and he was left without employment. As before, his motives are hard to fathom, perhaps belief in his own indispensability mingling with thoughts of gaining as much military authority as possible for political ends. Like several other senior Scottish officers in England he had had secret meetings with royalists in 1645, and he visited Charles I when he was being held prisoner by the Scottish army in Newcastle in 1646. In March 1647 Callendar's tendency to over-price himself when attempting to sell his services again revealed itself. As civil war in Britain seemed to have ended he proposed to raise a regiment to serve the king of France&#151;provided that he was made a brigadier-general (thus outranking the French officer who commanded all Scottish troops in French service) and captain of the horse of the king's household. The offer was refused  (Fotheringham, 2.30).<h2>
<a name="TheengagementandthebattleofPreston"></a>The engagement and the battle of Preston</h2>Callendar played an active part in the making of the engagement treaty between Scottish commissioners and the king, then imprisoned at Carisbrooke Castle, in December 1647, and was rewarded with appointments as sheriff of Stirling and keeper of Stirling Castle. When the engagers raised an army in 1648 Callendar had hopes of being appointed general, but his refusal to serve against Montrose in Scotland in 1644&#150;6, his tendency to harbour grievances, and doubts as to his trustworthiness counted against him. Instead he was commissioned to his old position of lieutenant-general, with the duke of Hamilton as general. The appointment was politically expedient, for to get the engagement accepted by the Scottish parliament the votes of a group of royalists who were suspicious of the sincerity of Hamilton's commitment to the king, and were led by Callendar, was essential. But Callendar's commission gave the engagers' army a second in command who was notoriously difficult to work with and who deeply distrusted his commander.<br>
<br>The disastrous decisions that led the engagers' invasion of England to defeat at Preston in August 1648 owed much to the unfortunate combination of Callendar, ever ready with ill-judged advice, and Hamilton, uncertain in military matters and ready to accept the opinions of the overbearing professional soldier he was supposed to command. By 17 August the Scottish cavalry had reached Wigan, and Hamilton ordered his infantry to follow it by crossing the River Ribble at Preston. However, news arrived that an English royalist force under Sir Marmaduke Langdale, which was moving to join Hamilton, had come under attack by Cromwell. Hamilton therefore cancelled his orders for the advance over the Ribble so that his infantry could support Langdale. But Callendar argued that the Scottish infantry could not resist Cromwell without cavalry support. The infantry should after all cross the Ribble, to put the river between them and Cromwell until the cavalry could be recalled from Wigan. Hamilton agreed, and only he, with Callendar and a few Scottish horsemen, went to Langdale's support. The royalists were quickly crushed by Cromwell. Hamilton and Callendar, with the remnants of the royalist force, escaped across the Ribble, and it was proposed to make a stand on the river. Callendar again intervened, arguing in favour of a withdrawal southwards under cover of darkness in an attempt to link up with the Scots cavalry. Hamilton again gave way to Callendar, but with the infantry already demoralized and bewildered by a confusion of orders and counter-orders, planned retreat quickly turned to precipitate flight, and the Scottish army disintegrated. Callendar's final contribution to the campaign was to advise the infantry to surrender at Warrington. Hamilton surrendered with the remaining cavalry at Uttoxeter, while Callendar fled to Holland, and was rumoured to be the only man in the whole army to succeed in escaping to the continent.<h2>
<a name="Unemploymentandimprisonment"></a>Unemployment and imprisonment</h2>Callendar returned to Scotland in May 1650, but was forced to leave immediately because of his role in the engagement. However, disaster at the battle of Dunbar (3 September 1650) and the English occupation of southern Scotland led to a relaxing of attitudes, and he was soon allowed to return. On 23 April 1651 the kirk accepted his declarations of repentance for his part in the engagement. It was even proposed that he yet again be made lieutenant-general, and when his reluctance to fight Montrose in 1644&#150;6 was cited as showing he was &#145;not worthy of trust&#146;  (T. M'Crie, ed., <span class="italic">The Life of Mr. Robert Blair</span>, Wodrow Society, 11, 1848, 170&#150;71) he argued that he had refused because Montrose had held a royal commission&#151;a declaration of royalism that suited the atmosphere of royalist revival in 1651 but failed to explain why he had been ready to fight those holding the king's commissions in England. Callendar was refused a military command but was appointed a member of the committee of estates, and he was present when the remnants of the committee were captured by the English at Alyth on 28 August 1651, though he managed to escape. He surrendered to General Monck in November 1651, but by December 1653 was reported to be &#145;lurking in some parts of the North&#146; awaiting an opportunity to join the royalist rebels there  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Commonwealth</span>, 305). He soon did so, a move that worried the English because of &#145;the dangerousnesse of his principles and spiritt&#146;  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Protectorate</span>, 47). However, he was arrested in February 1654, and spent some time as a prisoner in Edinburgh Castle, his estates being confiscated. In 1655 he went to London and after having &#145;kissed the Lord Protecteur his hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, First Earl of Ancram, and his Son William, Third Earl of Lothian</span>, ed. D. Laing, 2 vols., 1875, 2.391) obtained the restoration of his lands. On his return to Scotland he gave General Monck, the commander-in-chief there, his word as a gentleman that he would not act against Cromwell or the government. However, in August 1659 he refused to sign an undertaking, imposed by the collapsing republican regime, not to act against it or in favour of the exiled Charles II, and orders were given for his imprisonment in Stirling  (<span class="italic">The Clarke Papers</span>, ed. C. H. Firth, 4 vols., CS, new ser., vols. 49, 54, 61, 62, 1891&#150;1901, 4.41).<h2>
<a name="Rehabilitation"></a>Rehabilitation</h2>After the Restoration Callendar's refusal to serve against Montrose in the 1640s at last brought praise instead of suspicion, and on 11 May 1661 he was one of the fourteen earls who carried Montrose's coffin in the elaborate procession through Edinburgh which preceded his burial. Glimpses at personal life behind the public facade of the shifty professional soldier are rare. In 1633 he had married Margaret Hay (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1659), daughter of Lord Yester and widow of the first earl of Dunfermline. They had no children, though Callendar had two illegitimate children. In 1640 he founded a hospital for four aged and infirm persons at Falkirk. Nothing is known of his final years; he died at Callendar House and was buried at Falkirk on 25 March 1674. He was succeeded as earl by his nephew Alexander, the second surviving son of his elder brother Alexander Livingston, second earl of Linlithgow.<br>
<br>Lack of information about Callendar's early career makes it difficult to know what particular qualities as a soldier made Scottish regimes in 1639&#150;48 so eager to secure his services in a senior position. What political scruples he had probably inclined him towards royalism, but ambition made him willing to serve the covenanters. He then attempted to salve his conscience by serving the covenanters against the king in England but refusing service in Scotland, earning general distrust. In the 1648 engagement he at last served the king directly, but his animosity towards Hamilton combined with ill judgement on the field of battle to bring what had once been a distinguished military career to an ignominious conclusion.<br>
