<span class="headword">Donaldson,  John William</span>  (1811&#150;1861), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, born in London on 7 June 1811, was the second son of Stuart Donaldson, Australia merchant, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7805/', "Sir Stuart Donaldson")</script>. His grandfather, Hay Donaldson, was town clerk of Haddington, near Edinburgh, and his mother was Betty, daughter of John Cundale of Snab Green, Arkholme, Lancashire. He was educated privately, and at fourteen was articled to his uncle, a solicitor. In 1830, while in his uncle's office, he went up for an examination at University College, London, and gained the first prize in Greek. His ability attracted the attention of the examiner, George Long, by whose advice he was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1831. He gained a scholarship in 1833, and in 1834 was second in the classical tripos and senior optime. He proceeded MA in 1837, BD in 1844, and DD in 1849. He was elected fellow and tutor of Trinity in 1835, and up to his marriage in 1840 devoted himself to lecturing, teaching, and making himself master of the results of German philology. He was president of the union in 1839, and in the same year he was ordained deacon and published his <span class="italic">New Cratylus, or, Contributions towards a More Accurate Knowledge of the Greek Language</span>, said to be &#145;the only complete treatise on inflected language then in existence either in England or on the continent&#146;. Donaldson was right to stress the importance of the study of comparative philology, but his tone was polemical and his conclusions were doubtful. In 1844 Donaldson published <span class="italic">Varronianus</span>, which he defined in the preface to the third edition as &#145;an attempt to discuss the comparative philology of the Latin language on the broad basis of general ethnography&#146;. Although the work was unsystematic and of no lasting value, it involved him in a violent controversy with Professor T. H. Key, who accused him of plagiarism.<br>
<br>Donaldson lost his fellowship in 1840 on his marriage to Laetitia, daughter of Sir John Mortlock, banker at Cambridge, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. His first wife predeceased him, and he went on to marry Louisa, daughter of John Rawlins; they had three daughters. After taking pupils for a time at Winfrith in Dorset, in 1841 Donaldson was appointed headmaster of King Edward's School, Bury St Edmunds, an appointment unfortunate for the institution and for himself. He was deficient in judgement and administrative power, and the school declined under him, notwithstanding his efforts to obtain reputation by the publication of Latin and Greek grammars, which met with little acceptance beyond the sphere of his personal influence and involved him in controversy. They were probably too scientific for school use, and his conviction of the defects of standard grammars had been expressed with indiscreet candour. He was active in the cultural life of Bury St Edmunds, where he greatly improved the Athenaeum.<br>
<br>Donaldson resigned the headmastership in 1855 partly on account of the outcry caused by the publication of <span class="italic">Jashar; fragmenta archetypa carminum Hebraicorum; collegit, ordinavit, restituit J. G. Donaldson</span>, which appeared at the end of 1854. In this extraordinary work he endeavoured to show that fragments of a book of Jashar are to be found throughout the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scriptures up to the time of Solomon, that the book was compiled in the reign of that monarch, and that its remains constitute &#145;the religious marrow of the scriptures&#146;. The work was heavily criticized and Donaldson's religious orthodoxy was questioned. Although he defended his position in a vigorous pamphlet, he failed to convince his critics.<br>
<br>After resigning his headmastership Donaldson took up his residence at Cambridge, where he obtained a high reputation as a tutor, and he was elected one of the classical examiners of the University of London. In 1856 he produced a lengthy essay entitled &#145;Classical scholarship and classical learning&#146;, which despite its characteristically intemperate style contains interesting suggestions about the improvement of university classical teaching. He prepared new and improved editions of his <span class="italic">New Cratylus</span>, <span class="italic">Varronianus</span>, <span class="italic">Jashar</span>, and <span class="italic">Greek Grammar</span>; he also wrote a disquisition on English ethnography in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Essays</span>, and the article &#145;Philology&#146; in the eighth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and in 1858 completed K. O. M&uuml;ller's unfinished <span class="italic">History of Greek Literature</span>. He began a Greek dictionary, which was to have been the great work of his life. Unfortunately he worked far too hard, both as author and teacher. When advised to take six months' rest he replied that this would cost him &pound;1500. The neglect of the advice proved fatal. On coming to London in January 1861 he found himself unable to conduct the university examination, and on 10 February he died there at his mother's house, 21 Craven Hill, killed by overwork.<br>
<br>Donaldson had a brilliant mind, but he lacked the scholarly virtues of moderation and restraint. Judgement too often forsook him in his speculations, and taste in his controversies. He theorized far too boldly from insufficient data, and put forward as certainties views which should only have been advanced as suggestions. In biblical criticism more especially he can only be regarded as a brilliant amateur. He was greatly beloved by his friends, who included N. C. Thirlwall and W. H. Thompson. The diarist Henry Crabb Robinson spoke enthusiastically of the charm of his conversation. Donaldson produced a large number of other books, pamphlets, and reviews, especially in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and was part author with P. W. Buckham of <span class="italic">The Theatre of the Greeks</span>, which achieved considerable popularity in its time.<br>
