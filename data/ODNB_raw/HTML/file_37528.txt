<span class="headword">Hebdon, Sir  John</span>  (1612&#150;1670), <span class="occ">merchant and diplomat</span>, was probably born in London or Oxfordshire, the elder son and eldest of three children of John Hebden (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1583), merchant tailor of London, whose family came from Yorkshire, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Pope of Oxfordshire. The first record of him in Russia is in 1640, and in 1651 he was a signatory for a loan from Tsar Alexis to Charles II of 20,000 roubles (&pound;10,000), paid in furs and grain. Possibly as a result, Hebdon became a roving agent for Alexis from 1652, buying, to order, arms and many examples of western craftsmanship, recruiting military and other professional men to the tsar's service, and acting as partial translator at audiences with Oliver Cromwell's envoy to Russia in 1654. In 1656 he arranged ships to carry the tsar's embassy to Venice (from Archangel to Leghorn).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Hebdon settled in Tooting, but remained Alexis's agent. He addressed two remonstrances to the king, urging him to send ambassadors to Russia, and arranged accommodation for Russian ambassadors in England. When Charles II repaid the Russian loan, in the presence of Russian envoys in May 1663, Hebdon was knighted and appointed a privy councillor. Soon afterwards he accompanied Charles Howard, earl of Carlisle, as envoy to Alexis, but was not admitted to the negotiations, the Russians probably suspecting him of changing masters. Carlisle's negotiations for the restoration of the long-standing English trading privileges, withdrawn on the execution of Charles I, were unsuccessful, as were Hebdon's own efforts when he made his final visit to Russia in 1667, this time as envoy himself.<br>
<br>Hebdon and his wife, Phillippa, had four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, John, was envoy to Russia in 1676. The second son, Richard, a merchant, died in January 1668, and the third son, Thomas, died while accompanying Thomas Bryan (who also died), Sir John's son-in-law, on a mission to Persia in 1669 for Alexis. Sir John died in Tooting on 5 June 1670 and was buried in the old church; his will shows a debt due from the tsar and an amount still owed him for his allowance as ambassador.<br>
