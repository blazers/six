<span class="headword">Sharpe <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Seyffarth]</span>,  Louisa</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1798, <em>d.</em> 1843), <span class="occ">miniature and watercolour painter</span>, was born in Birmingham and baptized on 21 August 1798 at St Phillip's, Birmingham, the third of the four daughters of William Sharpe (1749&#150;1824), engraver, and his wife, Susanna, whose maiden name may have been Fairhead. All four sisters were artists and presumably taught at home by their father although their principal studies were said to have been carried out in French and German galleries. About 1816 the family moved to London and from the following year, when their address was 13 King Street in Covent Garden, Louisa and her sisters <a href="#cosubject_25226">Charlotte</a> and <a href="#cosubject_25229">Eliza [<i>see below</i>]</a> exhibited miniature portraits at the Royal Academy. Frederick, duke of York, was their first patron. Louisa Sharpe was represented by a total of twenty-nine works at the Royal Academy (1817&#150;29), several of these being of actresses and figures connected with the nearby theatrical world. After her election as a member of the Old Watercolour Society on 9 February 1829, she devoted herself to larger subject compositions or costume pieces in watercolour which she also exhibited at the Liverpool Academy (1832&#150;42). Of her thirty-nine exhibits (1829&#150;42) at the society the majority were dramatic, literary scenes evincing pathos or humour. She drew subjects from the works of Sir Walter Scott, Thomas Moore, George Crabbe, Lord Byron, William Harrison Ainsworth, Oliver Goldsmith, Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele, and from contemporary periodical literature. A principal attraction at the gallery, where they sold readily, her pictures were noted for their &#145;high degree of finish&#146;  (Roget, 2.43) and for an innovative &#145;bold style of watercolour drawing&#146;  (Clayton, 1.380). Her most detailed and elaborate subjects were priced at 100 guineas. Between 1829 and 1839 Louisa Sharpe's work was widely engraved to illustrate literature in contemporary annuals such as <span class="italic">The Forget-me-Not</span> (1829, 1831, 1836), <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> (1831&#150;3, 1835, 1837), <span class="italic">Portraits of the Principal Female Characters in the Waverley Novels</span> (1832&#150;4), <span class="italic">Heath's Book of Beauty</span> (1833&#150;7), <span class="italic">Fisher's Drawing-Room Scrap-Book</span> (1839), and <span class="italic">Heath's Gallery of British Engravings</span> (1836, 1838). In 1824 Eliza, Louisa and Mary Anne Sharpe moved to 44 Upper Charlotte Street and subsequently shared several addresses in central London. After her marriage, in 1834, to Dr Woldemar Seyffarth (a professor and author who later, after his wife's death, was commissioner from the king of Saxony to the London International Exhibitions in 1851 and 1862), Louisa Seyffarth lived in Dresden. She had two children, one of whom, Agnes Seyffarth (<i>fl</i>. 1850&#150;1859), was also a painter. She died in Dresden, &#145;of a painful disorder&#146;, on 28 January 1843.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25226"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Sharpe</span>  (<em>c.</em>1793&#150;1849), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was the eldest daughter, and was baptized on 2 July 1793 at St Phillip's, Birmingham. She exhibited nineteen miniature portraits at the Royal Academy between 1817 and 1841, from various London addresses. After her marriage to Captain T. Best Morris in 1821 there was a six-year hiatus in her exhibiting career (1824&#150;9) after which she resumed painting to support her family. The artist Charlotte B. Morris (<i>fl</i>. 1828&#150;1867) is thought to be her daughter. A son, J. B. Morris, died in childhood. Charlotte Morris died in 1849.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25229"></a><span class="headword">Eliza Sharpe</span>  (1796&#150;1874), <span class="occ">miniature and subject painter</span>, was the second eldest daughter. She was born in August 1796 in Birmingham and baptized on 21 August 1798 at St Phillip's, Birmingham. She exhibited forty-eight works, primarily portrait miniatures, at the Royal Academy (1817&#150;67). At the Old Watercolour Society&#151;of which she became a member in 1829 and subsequently secretary&#151;she showed eighty-four paintings (1829&#150;70), the majority being costume pieces illustrating scenes from literature, although from 1836 her most highly priced (and, it appears, least popular) works were on biblical themes. She was also represented at exhibitions in Liverpool (1838&#150;61) and at the Royal Manchester Instition (1841&#150;53). Between 1831 and 1840 her paintings were often engraved for contemporary annuals. Towards the end of her life she was successful as a copyist of paintings at the South Kensington Museum; five of her nine exhibits at the Society of Female Artists (1860&#150;74) were copies. Although less talented than her sister Louisa, by the 1870s Eliza Sharpe had earned &#145;a modest little fortune&#146;  (Roget, 2.207). She had also achieved a reputation for &#145;unusually original marked character&#146;, frequently manifest in acts of &#145;enthusiastic benevolence&#146;  (Clayton, 1.380). Having occupied at least twelve addresses in London, Eliza Sharpe died, unmarried, on 11 June 1874 at Woodside Poyle, Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire, the house of her nephew Mr C. W. Sharpe, the engraver. She was buried in Willesden cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25234"></a><span class="headword">Mary Anne Sharpe</span>  (1802&#150;1867), <span class="occ">miniature and subject painter</span>, was born in Birmingham, and baptized on 31 December 1802 at St Martin's, Birmingham. She exhibited from the same London addresses as her sister Eliza. She was represented by nineteen works at the Royal Academy (1819&#150;63), twenty-five at the Society of British Artists (1826&#150;64) of which she was elected an honorary member in 1830, ten at exhibitions in Liverpool (1831&#150;59), two at the Royal Manchester Institution (1847&#150;52), and six at the Society of Female Artists (1860&#150;65). She died in 1867.<br>
