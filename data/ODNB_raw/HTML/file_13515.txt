<span class="headword">Holland,  Charles</span>  (1733&#150;1769), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 12 March 1733 in Chiswick, the third of the three sons of John Holland (1697&#150;1764), a baker, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1778). At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a turpentine merchant, but he later pursued an interest in the theatre: he applied to David Garrick, and made his d&eacute;but at Drury Lane on 13 October 1755 in the title role in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>. By the end of the month he was performing as Dorilas in Aaron Hill's <span class="italic">Merope</span> and on 1 January 1756 he played George Barnwell in George Lillo's <span class="italic">The London Merchant</span>. Other roles in his first season at Drury Lane included Hamlet, and Florizel in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale, or, Florizel and Perdita</span>, Garrick's adaptation from Shakespeare.<br>
<br>Holland was to remain at Drury Lane until his death in 1769, and he became renowned there as a capable performer of significant lead and secondary roles. In his fourteen years on that stage he tackled characters as diverse as Bajazet, Hotspur, Iago, Macbeth, Oakley, Prospero, Richard III, Romeo, Young Norval, and Ferdinand in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. Some of the original performances he gave included Hamlet in Murphy's <span class="italic">The Orphan of China</span> (21 April 1759), Moody in <span class="italic">The Country Girl</span>, Garrick's adaptation of Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> (25 October 1766), Colonel Rivers in Hugh Kelly's <span class="italic">False Delicacy</span> (23 January 1768), and Sir William Evans in Elizabeth Griffith's <span class="italic">The School for Rakes</span> (4 February 1769). He also enjoyed some success over the summer months in provincial theatres: he played at the New Concert Hall in Edinburgh in the summers of 1757 and 1758, at Birmingham in 1762, at Bath in 1762&#150;3, and at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in 1763.<br>
<br>Holland maintained a close friendship with his fellow actor William Powell (1736&#150;1769), and in 1766 they joined together (along with Matthew Clarke) in the management of the King Street Theatre, Bristol. As an acting team they were showered with praise, and their two summers' work together in Bristol enjoyed both financial and critical success. On hearing of Powell's untimely death on 3 July 1769, shortly before the curtain was to go up on his performance in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Holland apologized to his audience for being too overcome with grief to be able to tread the boards that evening.<br>
<br>Holland was a good-looking and masculine actor with a strong and resonant voice, and his talents developed and improved steadily as he gained more experience. He earned the trust and friendship of Garrick, whom he admired and emulated, and his style was frequently compared with that of his mentor (though not always favourably). The <span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span> of 1757&#150;8 stated, for example, that he had &#145;all the merit a copy can pretend to; his face and voice are not disagreeable; and he cannot fail of being an actor of note&#146;. Holland came to excel in Garrick's favourite roles, such as Chamont in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, Hastings in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, and Tancred in James Thomson's <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span>. His performances in 1767 in Bristol earned him the praise of Thomas Chatterton, who enthused in his poem &#145;To Holland&#146; that &#145;No single part is thine, thou'rt all in all&#146;. There is some doubt, though, over how accomplished an actor he truly was. Susceptible to the flattery of women, he was also prone to arrogance and overstatement under the influence of generous applause. Gentleman described him in the role of Iago as &#145;hunting after a meaning he never found&#146;  (Gentleman, 1.152), and Kelly described his style as &#145;sententious, dull, and heavy&#146;  (Kelly, 13).<br>
<br>Holland, an attractive young man, was not beyond a little philandering and engaged in romances with ease. His affair with the wife of William Earle landed him in court in 1765 on charges of criminal conversation. He never married though he was engaged for a brief time to the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22531/', "Jane Pope (1744&#150;1818)")</script>. That relationship came to an end in 1768 following his being discovered with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1017/', "Sophia Baddeley (1744?&#150;1786)")</script> on a boat on the river at Richmond. Holland left no known children, except that he made provision in his will for &pound;200 to be placed in trust for a boy named as Harry should any inquiry prove the child to be his illegitimate son. The actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13516/', "Charles Holland (1768&#150;1849)")</script> was his nephew.<br>
<br>Holland died of smallpox at the age of thirty-six in the early hours of 7 December 1769 in his house in Cecil Street, Strand, London. He was buried on 15 December in his family's vault at St Nicholas's Church, Chiswick. A monument was erected to his memory in the chancel of the church, though it was later moved to the wall of the north tower and accompanied by a bust. This carried an inscription by Garrick testifying to Holland's &#145;Talents to make entertainment instructive to support the credit of the Stage by just and manly Action&#146;.<br>
