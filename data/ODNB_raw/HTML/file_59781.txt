<span class="headword">Brimelow,  Thomas</span>, Baron Brimelow  (1915&#150;1995), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 25 October 1915 at 94 Sale Road, Tyldesley, Lancashire, the second of three sons of William Brimelow (<i>b</i>. 1885), a cotton yarn salesman and later cotton mill director, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (<i>b</i>. 1890), a teacher. Early on he showed that combination of hard work and high intellect which was to mark his whole career: the elementary school in New Mills led to the county secondary school, a state scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford, and a first in modern languages in 1936. Brimelow's father had travelled widely for his firm and Brimelow, an ambitious lad who had won fellowships which gave him a year in Paris and a year studying Russian in Riga, decided on the consular service. He took first place in the 1938 examination. So, in October 1938, an apple-cheeked young man with an engaging smile who needed &#145;a bit of polish and slightly wider knowledge of the world to become very useful&#146;  (private information), he went as a probationary vice-consul to Danzig, deciphering telegrams, helping with the accounts, and serving at the counter. Here, as Europe moved to war, he acquired first-hand experience of totalitarian bullying which must have served him well when, as the Germans moved into Danzig, he went as vice-consul to Riga, in November 1939. A year later, as the USSR moved into Latvia, Brimelow, still only twenty-four, earned praise for his work in closing down the legation.<br>
<br>After a spell in New York, Brimelow was posted in June 1942 as third secretary and vice-consul in Moscow, where he spent the remainder of the war and began to acquire that personal experience of the workings of the Soviet state which was to make him, throughout most of the cold war, the acknowledged authority on the interpretation of Soviet policy and the formulation of the British response. He returned to Britain in the early summer of 1945, and, on 19 May 1945, married Jean Ethel (Jeanie) Cull (1917&#150;1993), a clerical officer in the Home Office, and daughter of John William Underwood Cull, a coach trimmer, of Glasgow. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Brimelow served in the Foreign Office from June 1945, and was officially appointed there in September 1945. He was promoted first secretary in November 1946. He served as first secretary (commercial) and consul at Havana from April 1948 to October 1951, when he returned to Moscow as first secretary until September 1954. He was made an OBE in the same year. There then followed two years in Ankara as counsellor (commercial) before Brimelow returned to the Foreign Office as head of the northern department, in August 1956. He was made a CMG in 1959. From 1960 to 1963 he served as counsellor in Washington, before again returning to Moscow as minister, until 1966. He was ambassador to Poland from August 1966 to March 1969, deputy under-secretary of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office until November 1973, and permanent under-secretary of state and head of the diplomatic service until November 1975, when he retired. He was promoted KCMG in 1968 and GCMG in 1975, and made a life peer, as Baron Brimelow of Tyldesley, in 1976. He took the Labour whip.<br>
<br>Brimelow's command of the Russian language and his understanding both of the Russian character and of the Soviet system were legendary. Some saw him as the toughest of the cold warriors. Tough he was and having, as he said, &#145;been brought up under Stalin&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 4 Aug 1995), he had no illusions. But his policy was essentially that of George Kennan: &#145;Stand up to them, but not aggressively and let the hand of time do its work&#146;  (G. F. Kennan, <span class="italic">Memoirs, 1925&#150;50</span>, 1967). In 1964, when it was hoped that, in its own interest, the USSR might move away from confrontation, Brimelow argued that the ideology of class conflict was pulling the cartload of Soviet interests in the wrong direction. One day the cart would wear out the horse. British policy should look towards that day, but the horse was not yet dead and the leadership was neither willing nor able to cut the harness. Unyielding in his hatred of the Soviet system, he still worked for better relations and opposed any policy designed to promote instability within the Soviet empire. He was content to wait another two decades until the horse fell terminally sick and Russia cut itself free.<br>
<br>In 1971, as deputy under-secretary of state, Brimelow advised on the mass expulsion of Soviet intelligence agents, but there was no truth to the suggestion that he was himself a member of the intelligence service. As deputy and later as permanent under-secretary his responsibility was much wider than the Soviet area. He was in a key position for the run-up to British membership of the EC and the first two years of membership. As head of the service he never forgot the well-being of its most junior members.<br>
<br>On retirement, while adding modern and ancient Greek to his linguistic repertoire, Brimelow took on the chairmanship of the Occupational Pensions Board (1978&#150;82) and served for two years as a member of the European parliament (1977&#150;8). Having mastered the complexities of agricultural finance, he used this knowledge to good effect in the House of Lords. A major retirement project was to research the repatriation of Soviet citizens at the end of the war. He had dealt with this as a junior in the northern department and, angered by unfair and inaccurate public comment, he worked with Brigadier Anthony Cowgill and Christopher Booker on a detailed study of the forced repatriation of Cossacks and Yugoslavs from Austria. This was published as <span class="italic">The Repatriations from Austria in 1945</span>, in 1980. Brimelow's separate history of the whole affair was, sadly, never published.<br>
<br>Brimelow's life was marked by an untiring devotion to the task in hand, a care for his fellows, and modesty in success. Never one for public display, his kindness was never superficial. Mild, inscrutable, and gentle in manner, he was logical and precise in analysis and exposition, ruthless in his demolition of muddled argument, and wide in his range of interests. From first to last he remained a rather private man, deeply devoted to his wife Jean and to their two daughters. His wife's death in 1993, after months of distressing illness, affected him deeply. He died at his home, 12 West Hill Court, Millfield Lane, Highgate, Camden, London, on 2 August 1995, of bronchopneumonia and myeloid leukaemia; his body was cremated. He was survived by his two daughters.<br>
