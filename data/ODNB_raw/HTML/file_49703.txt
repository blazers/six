<span class="headword">Saville <span class="st"> [Savill]</span>,  John Faucit</span>  (1783?&#150;1853), <span class="occ">actor, theatre manager, and playwright</span>, was reportedly seventy years old when he died, but neither his date of birth nor his parents' names are known. Perhaps his real name was, as is usually supposed, John Savill[e] Faucit: some early signatures and his initial stage name, Mr Faucit, support this. Yet most official documents, from his marriage record on, give Savill or Saville as surname, often with Faucit as middle name. His career began at Stepney fair, probably in his late teens: here he joined &#145;Muster [John] Richardson's&#146; company, which toured the fairs with a large, portable booth, acting in pantomimes and abbreviated, highly stereotyped dramas. In 1804, at about twenty-one, the small but personable actor was engaged at the Theatre Royal, Richmond, Surrey, where he played dashing, if secondary, roles such as Frank Rochdale in <span class="italic">John Bull</span> and Courtall in <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>. He and the fifteen-year-old actress <a href="#cosubject_49704">Harriet Diddear [<i>see below</i>]</a> became mutually attracted; in 1805, when he was again at Richmond and she was in her father's company at Margate, they eloped to London and were married&#151;under the name Savill&#151;on 2 September. Shortly afterwards, having been reconciled with the Diddears, they acted at Margate, then Dover, as Mr and Mrs Faucit.<br>
<br>In 1806 the couple joined the prosperous Norwich circuit, whose company travelled to seven towns and acted throughout the year; except for a brief hiatus (with Macready at Newcastle), they remained with it for seven years. Faucit acted &#145;second juvenile&#146; roles and &#145;Country Boys&#146; in conventional drama and principal parts in &#145;both serious &amp; comic Pantomimes&#146;; Mrs Faucit eventually played all the leading female characters. In 1813 they were engaged at a major London theatre, Covent Garden. Four children had been born during the Norwich years&#151;John, Harriet, <a href="#cosubject_49705">Edmund Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Alfred; after the move to London, there were two more&#151;Helena [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9200/', "Faucit, Helen")</script>] and Charles. All had careers as actors with the possible exception of Charles. At Covent Garden, although his wife was regularly employed, Faucit appeared only sporadically, mostly in minor comic parts such as Old Gobbo in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>; in 1817, however, he acted Gratiano in that play, winning critical approval for his innovative seriousness in the trial scene. His chief activity was in managing provincial theatres. In Greenwich, where he had his first theatre, he faced opposition from the religious dissenters, but, with the support of prominent citizens, he prevailed. By 1817 he was also operating the Theatre Royal, Margate, becoming its fully-fledged proprietor in 1820.<br>
<br>Faucit's wife left him in 1821 but continued to bill herself as Mrs Faucit, in consequence of which he reversed his names to Faucit Savill(e). According to an obituary in an unidentified journal  (New York Public Library) he obtained a legal divorce from his first wife and remarried twice: his second wife was Mrs Ann Amthos (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Collier), the widow of an actor, and his third, whom he married after Ann's death, was the daughter of a Yorkshire clergyman. The divorce was undoubtedly a polite fiction (the expense alone would have been prohibitive); but a Mrs Faucit Savill was listed in the Margate playbills beginning in 1822, and an Emily Moody was married (whether legally or not) to a John Faucit Saville on 11 April 1829. He had at least two more children, both apparently with Ann Amthos: Ann, who acted for a while, and Phoebe.<br>
<br>While continuing to manage the theatres at Greenwich and Margate, Saville from time to time undertook the running of others as well&#151;at Woolwich, Gravesend, Ramsgate, Deal, Dover, Sandwich, and Sheerness. After many fluctuations in success, he was brought near ruin by disastrous fires at Ramsgate (December 1829) and Greenwich (January 1831). But this &#145;unlucky devil&#146;, as he was known, remained resilient: recalling Richardson's booth, he replaced his lost theatres with one ingeniously constructed of cast-iron pieces, put together with screws, which could be disassembled and transported from town to town. After he gave up management (his last season at Margate was in 1840), he held an office for a while in the &#145;treasorial department&#146; of the City of London Theatre.<br>
<br>Saville's career as a dramatist, not counting an early Norwich effort, began with a melodrama, <span class="italic">Justice</span>, first performed at Drury Lane on 28 November 1820. Of some dozen other plays, several achieved considerable popularity. Notable successes were the melodrama <span class="italic">The Miller's Maid</span> (English Opera House, 1821), the nautical drama <span class="italic">Wapping Old Stairs</span> (Surrey, 1837), and the comedy <span class="italic">The Aldgate Pump</span> (Strand, 1841); the first of these had occasional revivals, in London and the provinces, for years afterwards. (A number of his plays and one by his first wife are preserved in the Larpert collection in the Huntington Library in San Marino and among the lord chamberlain's manuscripts in the National Archives.) Later in life he wrote a &#145;penny-dreadful&#146; novel, <span class="italic">The Heads of the Headless</span>. On 28 September 1853 the veteran returned to his old Margate theatre to act Benjamin Bowbell in <span class="italic">The Illustrious Stranger</span> for the benefit of his son Edmund. Shortly afterwards, on 31 October 1853, he died during his sleep at the home of his widowed daughter (probably Ann Wilkins), 31 Primrose Street, Bishopsgate, London.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49704"></a><span class="headword">Harriet Elizabeth Savill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Diddear; <em>other married name </em>Farren; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Mrs Faucit]</span>  (1789&#150;1857), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the daughter of provincial theatre manager John Diddear and his wife, Elizabeth. When not quite seven she made a successful d&eacute;but at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, under her father's management, as Edward in <span class="italic">Everyone has his Fault</span>. She continued to act during childhood and adolescence, at Brighton, Dover, Richmond, and Margate. Mrs Faucit's London d&eacute;but, as Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, was at Covent Garden on 8 October 1813; critics approved her appearance and voice but deplored her tendency to play to the audience and to turn Desdemona into an arch, vivacious Congreve heroine. Her most important part that season was Cleopatra in a lavishly mounted <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, with a text combining Shakespeare and Dryden. Although overshadowed by Eliza O'Neill, who arrived in 1814, she had a substantial metropolitan career for more than two decades, always at Covent Garden, Drury Lane, or the Haymarket. In 1821, after an unsuccessful attempt to have her marriage to John Faucit Saville annulled, she became the common-law wife of the eminent comedian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9193/', "William Farren")</script>, with whom she lived from then on. Their two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33090/', "William Farren")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9192/', "Henry Farren")</script>, also became actors. On 16 November 1853, shortly after Saville's death, she and Farren were legally married. Mrs Faucit was very successful in certain comic parts (such as Celia in <span class="italic">The Humourous Lieutenant</span>) and as the heroine of melodramas and musical plays. Her serious acting, which seemed meretricious in characters such as Lady Macbeth, was genuinely affecting in Meg Merrilies and similar roles; her handsome face and Junoesque figure were assets in regal parts such as Elizabeth in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and the empress in <span class="italic">The Exile</span>. She died in London on 16 June 1857.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49705"></a><span class="headword">Edmund Henry Faucit Saville</span>  (1811&#150;1857), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was, next to Helen Faucit, the most prominent of John Faucit Saville's children. Although he was trained in medicine, he chose the family profession. After several years of mainly provincial acting, he made his first important London appearance at the Surrey Theatre on 8 May 1837, as Abelard in Buckstone's new drama <span class="italic">Heloise and Abelard</span>. For sixteen years, until incapacitated by alcohol-related liver disease, he was a leading actor at the London &#145;minors&#146;, especially the Surrey, the Victoria, and the City of London, primarily in melodramatic roles such as the bold sailors in his father's nautical dramas and the villainous Bill Sikes in <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>. Occasionally he acted legitimate parts, including Hamlet and Othello, but his concentration on melodrama had coarsened what was evidently a genuine tragic talent. Saville was married twice, each time to an actress: with his first wife, Anne, he had a son, Edmund, and with his second, Clementina Sobieska Grant, he had a daughter, Harriet, who acted when young, and a son, Henry, who became a dramatist.<br>
