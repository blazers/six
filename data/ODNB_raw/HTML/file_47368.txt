<span class="headword">Jones,  Benjamin</span>  (1847&#150;1942), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and manager</span>, was born on 9 September 1847 in Salford, Lancashire, the son of Reuben Jones, a dyer's labourer, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brazier, who worked as a power-loom weaver. Jones entered employment at the age of nine, working as an errand-boy and bookkeeper before joining the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) in 1866. Jones was successively assistant bookkeeper, bookkeeper, assistant salesman, departmental manager, and assistant buyer of butter and cheese for the CWS in Manchester. In 1870 he married Annie White (<i>d</i>. 1894) at Altrincham.<br>
<br>Jones was chosen to establish the London branch of the CWS which opened in March 1874, directing the first enduring co-operative wholesaler to serve southern England. By his retirement in 1902 the London branch had an annual turnover of &pound;3.25 million. Jones also oversaw CWS extension, establishing sales depots at Bristol, Cardiff, and Northampton, new productive capacity through, among others, the Silvertown flour mill and the Luton cocoa works, and overseas depots providing supplies including Danish bacon and Spanish dried fruit. Such was his success that at least one private company attempted to poach Jones away from the CWS.<br>
<br>The establishment of a wholesaler in London assisted co-operative growth in southern England. However, previous weakness was not immediately overcome and Jones was involved in supporting aspiring societies through the Co-operative Union. From 1874 until 1894 he was secretary to its southern sectional board and was a central board member from 1875. Jones was also the first secretary of the Guild of Co-operators, formed to stimulate propagandism in southern England. Jones's interest in producers' co-operation is reflected in his book <span class="italic">Co-Operative Production</span> (1894). He was also secretary to the Co-operative Aid Association, formed to promote producers' societies, and chaired the board of the London branch of the Co-operative Printing Society. Jones disagreed, however, with Christian socialists among the southern co-operative leadership in doubting the viability of independent producers' societies, successfully advocating instead production by federal wholesale societies on behalf of consumers.<br>
<br>Jones supported many other co-operative causes. He founded the Blackley and Harpurhey Co-operative Building Society in 1872 and a later housing society, the London Tenant Co-operators' Society of 1888. In 1884 Jones spoke for co-operation before the royal commission on the housing of the working class and again in 1887 to the town holdings select committee. He also encouraged the development of the Women's Co-operative Guild, in which his wife was involved until her death. In 1889 and 1896 Jones presided at the national Co-operative Congress. He also represented the co-operative movement abroad, including on a world tour in 1896.<br>
<br>An advocate of co-operative education, during the 1860s Jones continued his own schooling with evening classes at Owens College and the mechanics' institute in Manchester. He subsequently served on the education committee of the Blackley Co-operative Society and was a Sunday school teacher at the ragged school in Harpurhey. Following discussion at the 1882 Co-operative Congress, Jones, with the academics Arnold Toynbee and A. H. D. Acland, planned a programme of instruction in co-operative principles. This was used at a class taught by Jones in London and was presented to the 1883 congress which established the education committee of the Co-operative Union. Jones also wrote <span class="italic">Working Men Co-Operators</span> (1884), with Acland, as a textbook for co-operative classes. He later assisted Beatrice Webb with research for her book <span class="italic">The Co-Operative Movement in Great Britain</span> (1891), greatly influencing her thinking about co-operation.<br>
<br>Jones pursued wider educational interests as a member of the London Playing Fields Committee and the school board for London, and he was also involved with evening class provision and was chairman of a working men's club. His interests extended into the political arena. In 1876 he was a member of the Labour Representation League and while living in Norwood became involved in local radical politics, including the establishment of the Norwood Reform Club. Jones was also the first secretary to the parliamentary committee of the Co-operative Union. He supported co-operative representation in parliament and himself stood unsuccessfully for Labour at Woolwich in 1892 and 1895 and as a Lib&#150;Lab candidate at Deptford in 1900.<br>
<br>Jones retired to Bournemouth where he owned the Queen Hotel, several caf&eacute;s, and a bakery. He died on 25 February 1942 at Bensholme Tuckton, Bournemouth, and was buried at the north cemetery of the crematorium, Bournemouth, on 2 March 1942. His wife predeceased him in 1894, but he was survived by his four children. Jones was a vigorous advocate of co-operative federalism, and his pragmatic view of co-operation shaped its development, particularly in southern England, during an important phase of growth in the 1880s and 1890s.<br>
