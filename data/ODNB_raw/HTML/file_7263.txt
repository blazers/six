<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies,  Sneyd</span>  (1709&#150;1769), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 30 October 1709 and baptized the next day in St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury. His father, John Davies (1668/9&#150;1732), was rector and patron of Kingsland, Herefordshire, and prebendary of Hereford and St Asaph. His mother, Honora (<i>b</i>. 1668), daughter of Ralph Sneyd of Keele Hall, Staffordshire, was second cousin to John Dryden, the poet, and was the widow of Thomas Ravenscroft (<i>d</i>. 1698). By her marriage to Davies she had three boys and a girl: Sneyd was the second and favourite son. Honora died before her second husband; he took as his second wife Isabella Hartstonge, widow of the bishop of Derry.<br>
<br>Davies was king's scholar at Eton College (1724&#150;9), was admitted as scholar at King's College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1729, and was fellow of King's (1732&#150;3; BA, 1733; MA, 1737). His Eton friends included Charles Pratt (also a fellow of King's, Cambridge), afterwards Lord Camden, and Frederick Cornwallis, future archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>John Davies died in December 1732. He had quarrelled with his eldest son, John (1704&#150;1735), so he bequeathed his rectory to Sneyd, who promptly took orders as deacon; he was ordained priest (Ely diocese) in December 1733. As a bachelor recluse at Kingsland, Davies amused himself with English and Latin poetical compositions and found a congenial crony in Timothy Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1751), rector of nearby Presteigne, who shared his tastes as far as superior age and fatness permitted. Davies's letters to Camden and other old college friends express contentment with his humble rectory, but he was pleased when Cornwallis, on becoming bishop of Lichfield, made him his domestic chaplain in February 1750 and, over the next five years, appointed him canon residentiary, master of St John's Hospital, Lichfield (2 July 1751), prebendary of Longdon, and archdeacon of Derby (5 May 1755).<br>
<br>In the 1750s Davies resided mainly in Lichfield, where he became known in literary circles. The young Anna Seward (1742&#150;1809) wept &#145;tears of delight&#146; at his &#145;voice of tremulously pathetic softness&#146; and &#145;religious energies, struggling through constitutional timidity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Seward</span>). No sermons of his are extant. He obtained a Cambridge DD degree in 1759 as a step to possible further preferment, and dropped hints to his old friend Lord Camden who, however, was unable or unwilling to oblige until Davies was too old and ill to care.<br>
<br>Sneyd Davies was a poor horseman, except on a chamber-horse; he was fond of smoking his pipe, and had a passion for bowling. He was never married, and was singularly simple, modest, and unworldly. A lady having once taken a seat in his carriage, he showed his discretion by pulling up the blinds as he passed through the town.<br>
<br>Davies never collected his poems. They include Latin verses, imitations of Horace's epistles, serious and burlesque imitations of Milton, whom he specially admired, and verses in the manner of Swift. Some appeared, initialled S. D., in collections (1732 and 1745) by his school and college friend John Whaley; nine were reprinted in Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection</span> (vols. 5 and 6, 1758). Davies helped to edit the Duncombes' <span class="italic">Works of Horace in English Verse</span> (1757), contributed imitations to it anonymously, and received the dedication of the fourth volume. His &#145;Caractacus&#146; (written in 1757 for an annual meeting of admirers of that hero on Caer Caradog) was first printed in Pennant's <span class="italic">A Tour in Wales</span> (vol. 2, 1783). More poems appeared in 1780&#150;81 in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and Nichols's <span class="italic">Collection</span> (vols. 6 and 7); more again were printed in a rambling life of Davies by George Hardinge (1743&#150;1816) in Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations</span> (vol. 1, 1817). There are manuscript copies of his verses in Nottingham University and the British Library (Stowe MSS 5832, 5845). By 1761, in Bath for his health, Davies was weak and paralytic and suffered from irritable nerves; in 1763 he had a stroke. He died on 20 January 1769 and bequeathed Kingsland rectory (income &pound;800 p.a.) to the Revd Richard Evans (1710&#150;1797).<br>
