<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Darling,  Charles John</span>, first Baron Darling  (1849&#150;1936), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Abbey House in Colchester on 6 December 1849, the elder son of Charles Darling, a farmer and estate manager, later of Langham Hall, Essex, and his wife, Sarah Frances, daughter of John Tizard, of Dorchester. Educated at home, he read voraciously and acquired an impressive command of French language and literature. He never went to university, but, obtaining an inheritance from an uncle, he commenced articles with a firm of solicitors in Birmingham. Transferring to the bar, he was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1872, where he read in the chambers of John Welch. He was called in 1874 and became a bencher in 1892. He &#145;devilled&#146; for John Huddleston in Crown Office Row and joined the Oxford circuit. He combined legal practice with journalism, contributing notably to the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>, the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, and the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. His career at the bar was not particularly noteworthy but he took silk in 1885. The same year, he married Mary Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1913), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11363/', "Major-General William Wilberforce Harris Greathed, RE")</script>, a veteran of the Indian mutiny, and granddaughter of Caroline Clive. They had one son, who predeceased his father, and two daughters.<br>
<br>In December 1885 Darling contested South Hackney as a Conservative, and after a further unsuccessful contest there in July 1886 against Sir Charles Russell he was returned at a by-election in February 1888 for Deptford, having defeated Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, and retained the seat until his elevation to the bench in 1897. His years in the Commons were undistinguished. A competent party man rather than a politician with any original contributions to make, he spoke on legal matters and on home rule for Ireland, and occasionally on social and economic issues such as the operation of the Fair Wages Resolution and matters pertaining to the dockyard victualling depot in his constituency.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1896 Darling was appointed commissioner of assize on his own circuit and did his work competently and for no payment, thus thwarting the Liberal Party's demand that he vacate his seat on assuming an office of profit under the crown. In October 1897 rumours spread that the lord chancellor, Lord Halsbury, was intending to appoint Darling to the High Court bench. On 26 October <span class="italic">The Times</span> devoted a leading article to the rumours and stated, without mentioning a name, that the subject of the rumour was a man of &#145;acute intellect and considerable literary power&#146;, but that he had given &#145;no sign of legal eminence &hellip; if he is raised to the Bench, it will be on political grounds&#146;. Two days later Darling's appointment to the Queen's Bench Division was announced. <span class="italic">The Times</span> returned to the charge; H. H. Asquith gave expression to his doubts, and much indignation was expressed in the Temple. The <span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span> charged that the &#145;way to the High Court bench is once more shown to be through contested elections and general service as a political hack&#146;, to the exclusion of learning, practical experience, and appropriate moral qualities. Yet despite the almost universal condemnation of Darling's appointment, the <span class="italic">Law Journal</span> wrote: &#145;He will prove a far better judge than some of his critics believe.&#146; In respect to his long judicial tenure which lasted until 1923, it may be said in his favour that his summing-up in criminal cases and his judgments in the court of criminal appeal were on the whole excellent, his judgments being particularly characterized by close reasoning and admirable English. Indeed, he often had to deliver judgments in cases where each side's evidence seemed hopelessly irreconcilable. In other cases, including <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> prosecutions, the evidence was frequently bizarre. In a murder trial he was very good. Unfortunately, in charges of less gravity he often allowed himself to behave with a levity quite unsuited to the trial of a criminal case, thinking erroneously that he could thereby induce the jury to bring in the right verdict by an eventual careful and accurate summing-up. In fact he had frequently lost the respect of the jury to such an extent that they ignored or paid little attention to the judge. The Pemberton Billing case (1918), with its sensational and absurd disclosure of a German &#145;black book&#146; naming 47,000 English moral degenerates, including R. B. Haldane, the Asquiths, and even Darling himself, was a shocking example and went far to lower the status of the bench. Darling often allowed himself as a judge to be grossly insulted by witnesses and laughed with them and at them. He presided over the notorious Stinie Morrison (1911) and Armstrong (1922) cases, <i>Douglas v. Ransome</i> and <i>Wootton v. Sievier</i> (1913), the Romney picture case (1917), and the Mond libel case (1919) among others, and was much concerned with the court career of Horatio Bottomley. In the court of criminal appeal Darling presided over the Crippen (1910) and Casement (1916) appeals. Few of his judgments, however, constituted precedents. One exception was <i>Chester v. Bateson</i> (1920) on the legality of subordinate legislation (albeit in wartime) with its fine quotation, in French, from Montesquieu's <span class="italic">De l'esprit des lois</span>. The case became familiar to many generations of constitutional law students and practitioners.<br>
<br>As an overall assessment of Darling's judicial career, the view of a later observer that it were better he had not been appointed to the bench is unduly harsh. No doubt he was, as some have suggested, a &#145;professional oddity&#146;, whimsical and given to &#145;inveterate facetiousness&#146;. Yet his literary sense and rapidity of literary allusion were due to a vast reading and a deep appreciation of English and French literature. Despite this, he was to some extent a &#145;populist&#146; judge who enjoyed entertaining his audience and receiving their plaudits in court. In that respect, the dignity which he lent to his office was perhaps less than appropriate on occasions. But many of his cases, meat and drink to the popular press of the day, deserved no better.<br>
<br>When R. D. Isaacs, Lord Reading, went to the United States of America as ambassador during the First World War, Darling as senior puisne of the King's Bench Division served as his deputy and his work was recognized by the distinction, unusual in the case of a serving judge, of being sworn of the privy council (1917). During the machinations by Lloyd George in 1922 to prevent the attorney-general, Sir Gordon Hewart, from vacating for the moment his Commons seat in order to succeed Reading as lord chief justice, Darling was mooted as a possible stop-gap appointment. Indeed, he had written to Hewart stating that he would be willing gladly to take the office for a little time&#151;&#145;even for ten minutes&#146;&#151;and to give it up when asked to do so. But to no avail. On being passed over in favour of the 77-year-old A. T. Lawrence, Lord Trevethin, he is said characteristically to have remarked that he supposed he was not old enough. Darling retired from the bench in November 1923, an event which was marked by a public farewell in court. In January 1924 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Darling of Langham. He spoke in the House of Lords on matters of legal interest, proposing unsuccessfully a modification to the MacNaughton rules on insanity by the inclusion of a new category of &#145;irresistible impulse&#146;. He took part in privy council cases as a member of the judicial committee, and as late as 1931 he returned to the King's Bench Division in order to assist in reducing arrears. In 1926 he made a six weeks' tour of Canada as guest of the Canadian Bar Association. His last three years were lived quietly. He died at the age of eighty-six at the Cottage Hospital, Lymington, Hampshire, on 29 May 1936 and was buried on 31 May at Beaulieu. He was succeeded as second baron by his grandson, Robert Charles Henry Darling.<br>
<br>Darling was a member of the royal commission on the working of the King's Bench (1912), and chairman of the committees of courts martial (1919), on the <span class="roman">Moneylenders Bill</span> (1925), and on national marks (1928). Given the controversy in subsequent years surrounding the First World War capital courts martial, it is unfortunate that the courts martial commission recommended that the evidence presented to it should not be published (it never was), and that Darling's ruling as chairman meant that it was prevented from fully investigating alleged miscarriages of justice.<br>
<br>Physically, Darling was small, gaunt, and somewhat short-sighted. He none the less affected to present a patrician hauteur in court. As a conversationalist, particularly in the benchers' room of the Inner Temple, he was pleasant, amusing, and often really witty, and was a delightful companion on a walk. He wrote <span class="italic">Scintillae juris</span> (1877), rich in gnomic wisdom and sharp satire, and <span class="italic">On the Oxford Circuit and other Verses</span> (1924), among other works of literary, although at times somewhat slight and precious, character.<br>
