<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  Francis  Avery</span>  (1910&#150;1998), <span class="occ">physician and gastroenterologist</span>, was born on 31 May 1910 at 26 Ritson Street, Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, the son of Francis Samuel Jones (1879&#150;1947), a surgeon, and his wife, Marion Rosa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chaston (1875&#150;1967). Both Francis and his brother used Avery as part of their surname. Avery Jones was educated at the Sir John Lemen School, Beccles, and at the medical school of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He qualified in medicine in 1934 and it was a sign of his distinction at that early period of his career that he was selected as house physician successively to professors Sir Francis Fraser, Leslie Witts, and Ronald Christie&#151;three of the most distinguished academic physicians of their day. He married, on 1 September that year, Dorothea Bessie (1907&#150;1983), a shorthand and typing teacher, the daughter of Henry Pfirter, a stockbroker; their son, John Francis Avery Jones, was born in 1940. In 1936 he obtained a Baly research scholarship and became assistant to Professor Witts, who was investigating the new technique, introduced by Meulengracht in Denmark, of liberally feeding patients who were bleeding from peptic ulcers instead of starving them. Using blood transfusion he and Witts were able to show that the mortality of the condition, then a common cause of hospitalization, could be dramatically reduced. This early interest in gastroenterology was further stimulated by an invitation in 1937 to attend the foundation meeting of a gastroenterological club, organized by Sir Arthur Hurst of Guy's Hospital, who was a major inspiration to him. The club later became the British Society of Gastroenterology.<br>
<br>In 1940 Avery Jones was appointed physician to the nutrition department of the Central Middlesex Hospital. Nutrition became one of his abiding concerns. During the war he organized a meals-on-wheels service to the population around his hospital. Together with his colleagues, Horace Joules and Richard Asher, he was determined that hospitals such as the Central Middlesex would play an increasingly important role in the medicine of the metropolis. But it was through his determination and quiet encouragement of gastroenterology at his hospital that he was able to establish a department which became famous worldwide and which attracted students from all over the globe.<br>
<br>He was particularly adept at the technique of gastroscopy, using the semi-rigid Wolf&#150;Schindler instrument for diagnosis and to observe the progress of healing of peptic ulcers. In 1946, with the return of young and ambitious physicians from the war, Avery Jones was joined by Richard Doll as his research assistant. Together, over the course of more than twenty years, they clearly showed that the bland diets and other now rejected treatments were of no benefit, and that stopping smoking was. At the same time Doll and Avery Jones conducted extensive surveys of peptic ulcer in the community that surrounded them. It was particularly entertaining for Avery Jones, whose natural reserve concealed a twinkling sense of humour, that when they conducted a survey in the nearby Heinz factory, whose well-known trade mark was &#145;57&#146;, they found that the incidence of peptic ulcer symptoms was 57 per thousand.<br>
<br>With the establishment in 1948 of the National Health Service (NHS), which Avery Jones strongly supported, his unit became increasingly busy. Nevertheless he was able to produce <span class="italic">Modern Trends in Gastroenterology</span> (1952), the first modern textbook on the subject in Britain. Soon afterwards he played an important if unobtrusive role in the development of the fibre-optic techniques that were to transform the practice of gastroenterology during his lifetime. In 1954 Harold Hopkins, of Imperial College in London, together with his student Kapany, published their epoch making paper describing their construction of a flexible fibre-optic bundle which would transmit light and enable an image to be defined. Hopkins was always disappointed that his paper made so little impact on the medical profession. One of those, however, who at once recognized the importance of Hopkins's discovery for the investigation of the alimentary tract was Avery Jones, who immediately asked a young South African research fellow, Dr Basil Hirschowitz, to explore the possibility of using fibre optics in gastroscopy. No British firms, however, were interested, and Hirschowitz went to the United States, where he successfully developed an instrument that could not only be used to see the stomach but could also be introduced into the duodenum. This achievement was at once taken up by Japanese academics and commercial firms, bringing about a revolution in gastroenterology as almost the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract could be seen directly.<br>
<br>By now Avery Jones had established a remarkable department at the Central Middlesex to which all aspiring gastroenterologists came. He had also developed a highly successful private practice and so gave his expertise not only to individuals in Britain but increasingly to those from overseas. In this way his experience of his subject became unique there. Always quiet and patient, often working long hours which might bring him to the patient's bedside late at night, he would write his highly valued opinion in a characteristically scratchy hand. He became increasingly in demand not only as an expert diagnostician but also as a humane and caring physician.<br>
<br>During those years the &eacute;lite London teaching hospitals paid little attention to gastroenterology, then not recognized as a speciality. It was Avery Jones at the Central Middlesex Hospital who provided the facilities for studies of gastrointestinal disease and teaching in the capital. By 1957&#151;supported by the Nuffield Foundation, the Medical Research Council, and the hospital authorities&#151;he had established a well-equipped unit with facilities for radiological investigation and screening. At the same time the Medical Research Council, which had sponsored and published much of the work of Avery Jones and Doll, was increasingly interested in supporting a centre where there was an abundance of clinical material and where a physiological approach to the study of human disease could be adopted. The unit was established alongside Avery Jones's department in 1960 under the direction of Tom Rowlands. The proposal had been strongly supported by Sir Harold Himsworth, the charismatic secretary of the Medical Research Council. The research unit played an important role in adding research training to the clinical experience of the Central Middlesex.<br>
<br>Avery Jones himself was increasingly in demand. In 1950 he had become civil consulting gastroenterologist to the Royal Navy. He also provided a consultant service to the Postgraduate Medical School of London at Hammersmith and served as a physician to St Mark's Hospital, then orientated particularly to the surgery of the bowel. He always encouraged the closest co-operation between physicians and surgeons, and it was fitting that he became one of those rare physicians to be awarded the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Avery Jones had a finely honed social conscience. He was the first to try and persuade the Royal College of Physicians to take action on the hazards of smoking. Having Richard Doll, co-discoverer with Professor Austin Bradford Hill of the dangers of the cigarette, working with him on his unit, he knew all too well the dangers of a habit which since he qualified in medicine had caused the death rate from cancer of the lung to rise from 3000 to nearly 17,000 a year. He had also persuaded a colleague, the chain-smoking Horace Joules, to abandon his pernicious habit overnight. In 1956, deeply concerned by the rising number of patients with cancer of the lung, he wrote to Lord Brain, then president of the college, to express his misgivings and ask that the college should put out a statement. Brain, however, replied that enough had already been said and that the college should play no part in advising the public. This response from a member of the specialist London &eacute;lite of the teaching hospitals to a physician from a district hospital on the outskirts of London, was symptomatic of the time. It was not until Brain retired the next year that the new president, Robert Platt, established a committee on smoking and health, of which Avery Jones became a member. The committee published its epoch making report on the hazards of smoking in 1962, a major contribution to the public health.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Avery Jones was devoted to improving the structure of the National Health Service. He was chairman of the king's fund committee on catering and diet in hospitals and he chaired the King Edward VII Hospital fund development and emergency bed service committee, as well as the Department of Health's advisory committee on medical records. He always maintained his interest in nutrition. He had a deep interest in the dietary fibre controversy, when it was suggested that the lack of undigested material in the digestive tract might lead to all manner of illnesses. He was a member of the British Nutrition Foundation and the first chairman of the Royal Society of Medicine's forum on food and health.<br>
<br>Avery Jones was increasingly involved in medical education. He served on the medical subcommittee of the University Grants Committee, was a member of the council of the University of Surrey and a governor of his old medical school, St Bartholomew's medical school, an appointment which particularly delighted him. He was a devoted member of the British Society of Gastroenterology, which developed from the club whose inaugural meeting he had attended in 1937 at the age of twenty-six. He became president in 1966. He had founded the journal of the society in 1960 and was an early editor. He called it <span class="italic">Gut</span>, a characteristically straightforward choice which sometimes caused amusement among German colleagues. As Avery Jones had foreseen the journal, starting as a relative unknown in the world of medical publishing, met a need both in Britain and in the wider world, for it soon established an international reputation as its circulation climbed. Avery Jones was committed to <span class="italic">Gut</span>'s remaining a clinical rather than coldly scientific journal. He wanted to see it on physicians' desks. Asked in later years how he accounted for its remarkable success, Avery replied: &#145;If I see the word rat or dog in the title, I cross it out&#146;.<br>
<br>Avery Jones received many national and international distinctions. He gave the first memorial lecture of the American Gastroenterological Association, was vice-president of the World Organization of Gastroenterology, and was the first medallist of a distinguished American honour, the Bockus medal. He received the CBE in 1967 and a knighthood in 1970.<br>
<br>After retirement Avery Jones maintained a keen interest in medicine, nutrition, and the NHS. An inveterate addict of the telephone, his many friends and pupils welcomed his continued interest and encouragement in later life. Shortly after the death of his wife Avery Jones married, on 4 August 1983, Kathleen Joan Edmunds, a retired nursing sister. At their home, 19 Peter Weston Place, Chichester, Sussex, he developed a remarkable herb garden, which included a collection of medicinal herbs. As the years passed he became increasingly frail. Nevertheless in 1997, the year before he died, he was able, though confined to a wheelchair, to attend the diamond jubilee of the British Society of Gastroenterology, and there he heard the lecture named in his honour. His own career had spanned the entire life of that society, which reflected the events of his own life. Much of what Avery Jones did was done unobtrusively behind the scenes, quietly and without fuss. But his major personal achievement was that from humble beginnings in a relatively unknown west London hospital, he became one of the leading and most influential physicians of his era. He died on 30 April 1998 at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, and was cremated at Chichester a week later.<br>
