</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perry, Sir  Thomas Erskine</span>  (1806&#150;1882), <span class="occ">judge in India and politician</span>, was born at Wandlebank House, Wimbledon, Surrey, on 20 July 1806, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21996/', "James Perry (1756&#150;1821)")</script>, proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, and his wife, Anne (1773&#150;1815), daughter of John Hull of Wilson Street, Finsbury Square, London. He was educated at Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1829. In 1827 he had been admitted to Lincoln's Inn, but after his graduation he went instead to Munich and attended the university there.<br>
<br>Upon returning to England in the early part of 1831 Perry joined the reform agitation. He became honorary secretary of the National Political Union of London and founded the Parliamentary Candidate Society, which aimed to promote reform by encouraging &#145;the return of fit and proper members of parliament&#146;. He was an ardent supporter of the ballot, not because he put great store by popular opinion, but because he saw it as society's best means for avoiding political intimidation and coercion. At the general election of December 1832 Perry unsuccessfully contested the seat of Chatham.<br>
<br>In May 1832 Perry left Lincoln's Inn for the Inner Temple, whence he was called to the bar on 21 November 1834. Though he joined the home circuit, he appears to have devoted himself to law reporting. With Sandford Nevile he published <span class="italic">Reports of Cases Relating to the Office of Magistrates Determined in the Court of the King's Bench</span> (1837) and <span class="italic">Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Court of the King's Bench, and upon Writs of Error from that Court to the Exchequer Chamber</span> (3 vols., 1837&#150;9). He jointly wrote four more volumes of the latter work with Henry Davison in the years 1839 to 1842.<br>
<br>Having lost the greater part of his fortune by the failure of a bank in 1840, Perry turned to his friends in the government for assistance and was appointed a judge of the supreme court of Bombay and, on 11 February 1841, was knighted at Buckingham Palace. Two months later he was sworn into his judicial office at Bombay. His early months in India were marred by the death of his first wife, Louisa (1813&#150;1841), only child of James M'Elkiney of Brighton and a niece of Madame J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bonaparte, whom he had married in 1834. Louisa died at Byculla on 12 October 1841 and was buried in St Thomas's Cathedral, Bombay.<br>
<br>In May 1847 Perry was appointed chief justice in the place of Sir David Pollock and continued to preside over the court until his retirement from the bench in the autumn of 1852. For the ten years prior to 1852 he also served as president of the Indian board of education. His liberalism and his enthusiastic advocacy of educational and employment opportunities for Indians made him popular with the small but articulate community of Western-educated Indians in Bombay, and upon his departure they contributed generously to the fund collected in his honour; the &pound;5000 thus raised was, at his request, devoted to the establishment of a Perry professorship in law at Elphinstone College. His Indian experiences inspired several publications, including <span class="italic">Cases Illustrative of Oriental Life and the Application of English Law to India Decided in H.M. Supreme Court at Bombay</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">A Bird's-Eye View of India</span> (1855).<br>
<br>Upon his return to England Perry wrote several letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> under the pseudonym Hadji advocating the abolition of the East India Company. In a by-election in June 1853 he unsuccessfully contested Liverpool, but in the following May was returned for the Liberals at Devonport, which borough he continued to represent until appointed to the Council of India in 1859. On 6 June 1855 Perry married Elizabeth Margaret, second daughter of Sir John Vanden Bempde-Johnstone, bt, and sister of Harcourt, first Lord Derwent.<br>
<br>As an MP Perry frequently addressed the house on the imperfections of the East India Company's government of India. He condemned the annexation of Oudh and, despairing at the repetition of history, argued that Lord Dalhousie, like Wellesley fifty years before him, had both exaggerated the misgovernment of the king of Oudh and ignored the extent to which his difficulties were attributable to conditions forced on him by the British. Perry accepted the essentially despotic nature of British rule in India, but hoped nevertheless for a display of benevolent liberalism from the British. He repeatedly called for the employment of Indians in the higher levels of the government service.<br>
<br>Perry also advocated improved property rights for married women, deprecating as unjust and injurious the rules of common law by which the personal property and earnings of a married woman accrued to her husband. On 14 May 1857, as chairman of the civil laws committee, he brought in a bill to amend the law of property as it affected married women; it was afforded a second reading, on 15 July, before being forced off the parliamentary timetable by the <span class="roman">Divorce Bill</span>.<br>
<br>On 8 August 1859 Perry was appointed a member of the Council of India, in which post he remained for over twenty years. His liberalism was undiminished, although he always tempered his enthusiasm for projects of public good with an eye to their cost. By the early 1880s he was instructing Lord Ripon, whom he greatly admired, that it was his duty as viceroy to prepare Indians for self-rule; it might, Perry conceded, seem a utopian project but it was undeniably a noble one.<br>
<br>In November 1881 Perry's health began to fail and he retired from the council early in the new year. A few months before his death the queen approved his admission to the privy council, but he was too ill to be sworn in. He died at his residence, 36 Eaton Place, London, on 22 April 1882, aged seventy-five. His second wife, Elizabeth, survived him for over thirty years; she died on 11 April 1913.<br>
