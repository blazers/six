<span class="headword">Barnett, Dame  (Mary) Henrietta</span>  (1905&#150;1985), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at Glasnevin, Barnes Close, in Winchester on 16 February 1905, the youngest child and second daughter of Colonel George Henry Barnett CMG DSO, and gentleman-at-arms, of the 60th rifles, and his wife, Mary Dorothea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker. She was educated at Heathfield School, Ascot, Berkshire (where she was known as Molly) from September 1918 to July 1922. Perhaps inspired by her father, she started what was to become her military career in 1938 as a volunteer in the no. 45 county of Oxford company of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, before transferring to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) after its establishment on 28 June 1939. She quickly rose through the ranks, serving during the early part of the war at RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire and at RAF Feltwell in Norfolk, and then, in the testing conditions of the London blitz, as officer-in-charge of WAAF at the Air Ministry. Having served on home bases throughout the war, a posting in the summer of 1945 took her to the different, but in many ways equally challenging, environment of the headquarters of the Mediterranean allied air forces. Here she was staff officer responsible for all WAAF personnel working in the RAF Mediterranean and Middle East command, which included bases in Algiers and Cyprus. Although based in the grounds of Caserta Palace in Italy, in a converted Nissen hut that she nicknamed the Mushroom, Barnett travelled widely throughout the command, resolving welfare and other problems with tact and diplomacy, inspecting existing WAAF quarters, and assessing the feasibility of posting WAAF still further afield.<br>
<br>On her return to Britain in October 1947 she served first as WAAF staff officer at headquarters Flying Training Command, and then from October 1948 as WAAF inspector, a job that again involved considerable travelling, although this time confined to bases within home commands. The immediate post-war years were a time of transition for the WAAF, from a wartime to a peacetime force, and also from an auxiliary and temporary adjunct to the RAF to a permanent, enlisted service. This latter change was a complex one involving considerable and lengthy negotiations and, although the requisite legislation was enacted in March 1948, it was to be almost another year before the permanent service was properly established. When the Women's Royal Air Force finally came into being on 1 February 1949 it was with Barnett as one of its two deputy directors, with responsibility for the selection, promotion, and career and personal problems of WRAF officers.<br>
<br>From June 1950 she served for two and a half years as WRAF staff officer for home command until, on 1 November 1952, she became the only female station commander in the RAF on her appointment as commanding officer of Hawkinge in Kent. Hawkinge was primarily the WRAF officer-training centre&#151;the female equivalent of RAF Cranwell&#151;but it was home not only to up to 200 WRAF, but also to 70 members of an RAF glider unit. This was suitable preparation for command on a rather larger scale, and on 1 August 1956 she was appointed director of the WRAF with the acting rank of air commandant.<br>
<br>During her time as director of the WRAF she sought particularly to promote the expansion of the service, and as part of her recruitment campaign she oversaw the introduction of a scheme of local service enlistment to the force, and the increase of WRAF rates of pay from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the corresponding rates for the RAF. Her wartime experience of overseas service stood her in good stead in her role as ambassador for the service abroad, and she visited units in the Middle East, the Far East, Singapore, Malaya, Malta, Denmark, Gibraltar, and the NATO base at Fontainebleau, Paris. At home she enthusiastically led the WRAF in raising funds for the restoration of St Clement Danes Church on the Strand, London, which was reconsecrated as the official RAF church by the bishop of London on 19 October 1958, and in 1959 she oversaw the celebrations to mark the tenth anniversary of the integration of both the WRAF and the Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service into the RAF. Tall and slim, she combined the requisite immaculateness in uniform with a homely and approachable appearance. She was appointed OBE in 1950, CBE in 1956, and DBE in 1958, and as director of the WRAF she was aide-de-camp to the queen.<br>
<br>In March 1960 Dame Henrietta Barnett retired to a cottage in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where, as well as maintaining her links with the WRAF as a member and sometime chairman of the executive committee of the WRAF Officers' Association, she involved herself in local affairs, serving as mayor of Woodstock from 1968 to 1969, and she continued to enjoy the country pursuits of fishing and hunting; as commanding officer of Hawkinge she had entertained the local hunt. She died of a heart attack at her home, Hoggrove House, 24 Park Street, Woodstock, on 11 September 1985.<br>
