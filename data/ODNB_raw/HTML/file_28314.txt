<span class="headword">Vincent,  Richard Budd</span>  (1770?&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Newbury, Berkshire, where his father, Osman Vincent, was a silk merchant and banker. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28311/', "John Painter Vincent")</script> was his brother. Richard entered the navy in 1781 on the <i>Britannia</i>, flagship of Vice-Admiral Samuel Barrington, and was present at the relief of Gibraltar and the encounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel in October 1782. He was, after the peace, for three years in the <i>Salisbury</i> on the Newfoundland station, served for four years in the channel, and on 3 November 1790 was promoted lieutenant. In 1793 he went to the Mediterranean in the <i>Terrible</i>, was present at the Toulon operations, and in 1794 on the coast of Corsica. In October 1794 he was moved into the <i>Victory</i>, Lord Hood's flagship, then understood to be the prelude to certain promotion. But in April 1795 Hood was summarily ordered to strike his flag, and Vincent's chance was gone. It did not come again until 29 April 1802, when, after seven years' continuous service, mostly in the North Sea, he was promoted commander, and three weeks later was appointed to the <i>Arrow</i>, one of a class of sloops built and armed on a plan proposed by Samuel Bentham. She carried twenty-eight 32-pounder carronades, an armament heavier, in the weight of shot, than that of any frigate then afloat, but effective at only very short range. After nearly a year's anti-smuggling service in the channel, she was paid off on 28 February 1803, and recommissioned the next day, again by Vincent, for the Mediterranean, where for the next two years she was mostly engaged in convoying the trade up the Adriatic and around the Greek archipelago.<br>
<br>By the end of 1804 the <i>Arrow</i> was in need of a thorough repair; many of her timbers were rotten, and a survey at Malta decided that she was too weak to heave down; she must go home to be docked. She was accordingly ordered, with the bomb-vessel <i>Acheron</i> in company, to take charge of the homeward-bound trade. They sailed from Malta towards the end of January, and on 3 February were seen and chased between Algiers and Cape T&eacute;n&egrave;s by two French frigates, the <i>Incorruptible</i> (38 guns) and <i>Hortense</i> (40 guns), the only two ships of Villeneuve's squadron which had continued at sea when the squadron itself was driven back by bad weather on 21 January. Between these and the convoy Vincent interposed the <i>Arrow</i> and the <i>Acheron</i>, hoping that he might at least be able to give the merchant ships time to escape. At about 7.30 on the morning of 4 February the French frigates brought them to action, and captured both after a brilliant defence of nearly two hours. Armed only with carronades the two vessels were outranged in a one-sided battle. The <i>Arrow</i> sank almost immediately afterwards, before all her men could be removed; the <i>Acheron</i> was set on fire and destroyed. The merchant ships had meanwhile escaped to the westward, and only three of them were captured. Officers and men were taken to Cartagena, whence in May they were sent in a cartel brig to Gibraltar. They arrived in England early in June. The court martial on Vincent, on 17 June, honourably acquitted him, and praised his conduct.<br>
<br>Two days after the trial Vincent was advanced to post rank by a commission dated 8 April, and on 3 July the committee of the Patriotic Fund awarded him a sword of the value of &pound;100, and a piece of plate of the same value. Four years later the merchants of Malta presented him with a handsome service of plate. In May 1806 he was appointed to the <i>Brilliant</i> (28 guns) on the Irish station, but in October he was obliged by ill health to resign the command, nor was he able to accept any further employment until March 1808, when he was appointed to the frigate <i>Cambrian</i> in the Mediterranean. From her he moved into the <i>Hind</i> (28 guns), but in September 1808, being at Malta, he complied with the request of Sir Alexander John Ball to assist him in the duties of the port as captain of the <i>Trident</i> (64 guns). With Ball and his successors, he remained in the <i>Trident</i> until December 1815, when he was appointed to the <i>Aquilon</i> (32 guns), in which he returned to England in April 1816. He was made a CB in June 1815. He had no further service and died at Deal, Kent, on 18 August 1831.<br>
