<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Overall,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1561, <em>d.</em> 1619), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was born at Hadleigh, Suffolk, and baptized there on 2 March 1561, the younger son of George Overall, who died that July. He was educated at the local grammar school in Hadleigh, where John Boys, son of the rector of West Stow, Suffolk, was one of his contemporaries. John Still, then Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Cambridge, and parish priest from 1571, took an interest in their education. Owing to his patronage and direction both applied to St John's College, Cambridge, when in 1575 he became master. When Still moved to become master of Trinity College, Overall followed him and on 18 April 1578 was admitted as a scholar, alongside Anthony Maxey. He graduated BA in 1579 and became a minor fellow on 2 October 1581. He proceeded MA the following year and on 30 March became a major fellow. Overall received other college preferments while Still was master and at the start of the academic year in 1586 he was made praelector Graecus: by October 1588 he was praelector mathematicus. He became seneschal on 17 December 1589 and junior dean on 14 October 1591; that year he was also ordained priest at Lincoln. He was briefly, in 1591&#150;2, vicar of Trumpington, a college living just outside Cambridge. In 1592 Sir Thomas Heneage, on behalf of Elizabeth I, presented him to the vicarage of Epping, Essex.<br>
<br>In December 1595 Overall was appointed regius professor of divinity at the death of William Whitaker. He was popular with his pupils and although his election had the queen's support, it was the result of a vote of younger university men against the deterministic doctrines of Whitaker. Overall had publicly acquitted himself at a disputation with Anthony Wotton before the earl of Essex and his election may have been a snub for Archbishop John Whitgift, who had adopted the Calvinistic Lambeth articles with Whitaker's support. Overall, with Lancelot Andrewes, Samuel Harsnett, and others, had rejected these articles in support of Peter Baro, the Lady Margaret professor of divinity, when on 12 January 1596 he attacked them from the pulpit. This opposition cost Baro his chair, as he failed to be re-elected in 1596 and was succeeded by Thomas Playfere, but the style of Cambridge theology did not become monochrome. Overall was not as radical as Baro but in 1599 he clashed with the authorities when he maintained that the perseverance of a truly justified man was conditional upon repentance. There followed a year-long campaign against Overall which ultimately had little effect. In the summer of 1600 even his objection to Richard Neile's teaching on private confession was censured. None the less, he retained his chair until he resigned it in 1607.<br>
<br>As one of the chaplains-in-ordinary to the queen Overall was appointed by Whitgift in 1598 to preach before her on the third Wednesday of Lent, 15 March, in place of Bishop Godfrey Goldsbrough of Gloucester. Shortly afterwards, at Easter, his theological position was further endorsed in Cambridge when he was appointed master of St Catharine's College, with the support of Whitgift. Thereafter he was occasionally chosen to give Lenten sermons before the queen, but he was not happy in the pulpit. It was reckoned that years of classical lecturing in Latin had made it &#145;troublesome to him to speak English in a continued oration&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 61). John Manningham, a Magdalene graduate who would have heard Professor Overall in Cambridge, later complained that he &#145;discoursed verry scholastically&#146; when he preached a Whitehall sermon at the dead queen's court on 6 April 1603  (BL, Harley MS 5353, fol. 120<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>In 1602 Overall was made rector of Algarkirk, Lincoln; he held the living for three years. With the support of Sir Fulke Greville he was nominated dean of St Paul's Cathedral in May the same year, in succession to the nonagenarian Elizabethan dean, Alexander Nowell. At his election on 29 May Bishop John Bancroft collated him to the prebend of Tottenhale in that cathedral. On 6 June Lawrence Barker, vicar of St Botolph, Aldersgate, and a former colleague at Trinity, spoke at Paul's Cross of the &#145;gravity &amp; learning and life&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 5353, fol. 25<i>v</i>) of the new dean. The deanery itself became a haven for scholars like Scultetus who shared the house with him. Overall himself, according to the radical preacher Thomas Scott, emerged as something of a zealous ritualist. In 1603 he became rector of Clothall in Hertfordshire (which he held until 1615). He staffed that parish with a curate as he did also Therfield, his other Hertfordshire benefice from 1605, which he surrendered in 1614 to a Hadleigh contemporary, Bishop Still's nephew, William Alabaster, when he converted back to the Church of England.<br>
<br>At the Hampton Court conference Overall spoke on 16 January 1604 of predestination, using much material from his Cambridge disputes of the 1590s. In particular he questioned double predestination by considering those who lapsed, such as those who though previously considered justified had then committed adultery. Although his <span class="italic">Sententia ecclesiae Anglicanae praedestionibus</span> were not printed in his lifetime they circulated widely in manuscript and informed George Carleton's theological reading at the Synod of Dort. They were published several times from 1631. As a result of the conference Overall found himself responsible for adding a substantial section to the catechism, on the sacraments. This amplified catechism remained at the heart of Anglican teaching and praxis until the 1970s. When the controversial Edmund Reeve wrote <span class="italic">The Communion Book[e] Catechisme Expounded</span> in 1635 for his parishioners of Hayes, Middlesex, he paid tribute to both Overall and John Buckeridge for their work on the sacraments. Writing to Bishop Wright of Lichfield, Reeve claimed that Overall, &#145;that most greatly learned Divine&#146;, was the &#145;first instrument which God used for to instruct me in the Catholicke faith&#146;  (Reeve, sig. B3). Overall was also invited to join the Westminster team of ten biblical revisers under Lancelot Andrewes who worked to translate the first books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, up to <span class="roman">2 Kings</span> inclusive, for the 1611 Authorized Version.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1604 at Mitcham, Surrey, Overall married Anne, daughter of Edward Orwell of Christ Church, Greyfriars Newgate, London, registrar of the court of arches, who came from a Lancashire family. Perhaps the Anne baptized at Christ Church on 11 May 1583, she was, according to John Aubrey, &#145;the greatest Beautie of her time in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 226). Although she committed adultery with the notorious womanizer Richard Sackville, third earl of Dorset, and with Sir John Selby of Yorkshire, she was not subject to ecclesiastical censure. Her marriage to Overall was childless.<br>
<br>Following Thomas Ravis's promotion to the bishopric of Gloucester, in March 1605 Overall succeeded him as prolocutor of the lower house of the convocation of Canterbury. As such he worked closely with Archbishop Richard Bancroft. In the following year convocation produced canons in response to the outrage felt at the Gunpowder Plot and the need to circumscribe the actions of Catholics who upheld political resistance to tyrants. Although three books of canons were provided only the first passed both houses of convocation in both provinces, and James VI and I resisted their publication since he believed that the twenty-eighth canon, which spoke of &#145;bordering kings&#146; who &#145;through ambition and malice&#146; invade their neighbours, reduced his own title to kingship to being merely <i>de facto</i>. The remaining books of canons, ascribed to Overall, were not published until 1690, when Archbishop William Sancroft used them in an attempt to justify the position of the nonjurors although Anglican defenders of the 1688 revolution had seized upon the same objected phrases to countenance William III's illegal act.<br>
<br>Largely through the support of Sir Fulke Greville, whose family home was Warwick Castle, Overall became bishop of Coventry and Lichfield; he was elected on 14 March 1614 and consecrated on 3 April following. He spent most of his time in London, and seems only to have visited the diocese occasionally, first in 1614 and then during the royal progress south after James I's only visit to the Scottish kingdom in the summer of 1617 when the king arranged to meet his bishop at Coventry. The absence of his register makes it impossible to judge his role as a governor in the diocese but he maintained theological interests in his correspondence with the likes of Vossius and Grotius on the continent and provided for the clergy of his diocese by ordaining in the capital. Much of his time was spent working alongside Lancelot Andrewes and John Buckeridge in the court of high commission. He was involved in the deprivation and censure of four ministers (between December 1614 and May 1617), and in examining Catholic priests in January 1618. Having avoided preaching at court between 1603 and 1615, he took a regular turn on the third Sunday in Lent in 1616, 1617, and 1618.<br>
<br>Following a <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> dated 9 May 1618, on 21 May the dean and chapter of Norwich elected Overall as bishop, but this was not confirmed until the end of the summer, when he moved to Norwich Palace. His further preferment is something of a surprise, and cannot have been much to the liking of the primate: in November 1617 Archbishop Abbot wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton that he feared that Overall &#145;maketh no bones &hellip; to deliver doubtfull thinges for true and fained thinges for certaine&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/105/95, fol. 9<i>v</i>). Indeed, Overall was one of the remonstrants' proposed delegates to the Synod of Dort. However, he did not long survive his translation to his home diocese, as he died on 12 May 1619. He was buried in the south choir aisle of the cathedral. The monument above his tomb was put up in 1669 at the expense of his former secretary and amanuensis, John Cosin.<br>
<br>Overall's most enduring legacy, beyond his contribution to the revised catechism of the Church of England, was his visitation articles of 1619. At Lichfield the triennial visitations of 1614 and 1617 had been the excuse that took him to his diocese; although those articles do not seem to exist, presentments to his visitation suggest that he was concerned to encourage the appropriate provision of communion plate across his diocese. He did not live long enough to make a visitation of the Norwich diocese in person but his articles formed the antecedents of at least twenty other sets issued in the 1620s and 1630s, including those of Harsnett (1620) and of Andrewes (1625). Bishop Richard Neile at Durham even absorbed Overall's article about private confession, their old duelling ground. Their shape in part derived from those of John Jegon (1611). Within them Overall went well beyond the 1571 requirement on preachers not to treat of subjects not agreeable to scripture, making the churchwardens responsible for ensuring conformity in the pulpit. In insisting upon conformity he was more successful, even in a short space of time, across the diocese than had been his predecessor.<br>
