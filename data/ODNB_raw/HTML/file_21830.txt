<span class="headword">Pendarves,  John</span>  (1622/3&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister</span>, was born at Crowan, Cornwall, son of John Pendarves. The Pendarves were county gentry but this branch seems not to have been prosperous, and at the age of fifteen John and an older brother, Ralph, entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1638 as servitors. He graduated BA in 1642. Exeter College under John Prideaux was a stronghold of puritanism opposing the prevailing Laudian orientation of the university. According to Wood, Pendarves ran through the various forms of radical religion on offer before embracing Baptism in the later 1640s. In May 1644, when parliamentary forces took Abingdon (then in Berkshire) from the royalists, he became vicar of St Helen's, the larger, and traditionally the more radical, of the two churches in that town. He was also by 1649 minister of the nearby town of Wantage, but resigned both livings in or soon after 1650 and took on the formal leadership of the Particular (Calvinistic) Baptist congregation in Abingdon. In the rest of his short career, he became increasingly active and prominent in both local and national Baptist affairs.<br>
<br>By 1649 Pendarves was in contact with William Kiffin, the London Baptist leader, and was probably already engaged in preaching and organizing in the villages within reach of Abingdon and Wantage. Baptist churches were in being both in Abingdon and in Wantage before 1650, and drew their membership from a wide radius. Pendarves's slowness to resign from his parish cures even after he had become a convinced separatist, and his readiness to take the engagement in 1649, may have been a function of his financial needs. The incumbency of St Helen's was worth only &pound;20 per annum but the committee for plundered ministers allocated him an additional &pound;50 per annum, although the earlier payments fell heavily into arrears. Only after 1648 did a personal lectureship in Marcham and Abingdon guarantee him an independent income of &pound;30 per annum. It was presumably in order to have central congregations of adequate size to support Pendarves and the Wantage minister, Robert Keate, with their voluntary contributions that no further Baptist churches were set up in the Vale of White Horse during Pendarves's lifetime, in spite of a general principle that such churches should be local. Soon after his death his congregation split, with ninety-nine members leaving to found new churches at Longworth and Faringdon to the west of Abingdon. Since the Abingdon church remained more significant than these, it probably numbered some hundreds of members at its peak.<br>
<br>Pendarves proved a talented organizer. To maintain co-ordination among Baptist congregations within a region which included, at its greatest extent, parts of Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Hampshire as well as Berkshire, he and Benjamin Cox had, in 1652, established the Abingdon Association, a forum at which &#145;messengers&#146; would meet, usually three times a year for up to three days, at Tetsworth, Oxfordshire. This followed normal Baptist practice at this time. By the time of Pendarves's death, the number of individual churches represented was twelve. Discussion was limited to issues of local importance; questions of dogma and political strategy were referred up to the Baptist assembly at Petty France in London.<br>
<br>In spite of his sectarian position, Pendarves remained a figure of high local respectability. As late as 1653 he could still preach before the mayor of Abingdon and civic notables in St Helen's Church. He was not named to the Berkshire commission&#151;the ejectors&#151;which was dominated by Presbyterians, and declined to co-operate with them in 1654 in their prosecution of the Behmenist John Pordage of Bradfield; but one of the accusations made in the same year before the ejectors against the orientalist Edward Pococke, who had been banished from Oxford to his living at Childrey, was that he had refused Pendarves permission to preach from his pulpit.<br>
<br>Pendarves was known as a controversialist, always ready to engage in set-piece preaching contests with opponents. One such occasion was at Ilsley, Berkshire, in 1649, when Pordage's contribution led to his later heresy trial before the ejectors. Another was against the moderate Jasper Mayne at Watlington church in 1652, which seems to have been somewhat disturbed by Pendarves's rowdy followers. Mayne suggested that the standard appellations applied by radicals to the traditional Anglican church&#151;&#145;whore of Babylon&#146;, &#145;habitation of devils&#146;, and the like&#151;were unnecessary and inappropriate. Pendarves was unimpressed, and in a major pamphlet, <span class="italic">Arrowes Against Babylon</span>, published in 1656, emphasized the radical view that the church, now dominated by presbyterians, was simply the same whore in attractive new clothes. He upheld the principle of the separation of the godly from the reprobate, and attacked the established clergy for allowing the latter into their churches. This provoked replies from John Tickell (<span class="italic">Church-Rules</span>, 1656) and William Ley (<span class="italic">Ueperaspistis</span>, 1656), Pendarves's successors at St Helen's and Wantage respectively, both of whom accused him of arrogance and authoritarianism.<br>
<br>Because of his west country origins, Pendarves was in close contact with the Baptist Western Association, and attended several of its meetings in the last years of his life. This association, under the influence of Thomas Collier and a group of Fifth Monarchist clergy, maintained a certain independence of the politically cautious line of the Particular Baptist leadership in London, and by 1655 was disillusioned with the protectorate and disappointed at the continued delay in the arrival of the millennium. Pendarves joined with the western millenarians in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Sighs for Sion</span> (1656), warning the faithful against despair and enjoining them to increased spiritual effort by way of prayer and fasting. In the period of tension that followed the dissolution of the first protectorate parliament in early 1655, when Thomas Harrison and several other millenarians were effectively on trial before Cromwell and his council, Pendarves was one of a group brought in at their request to help them argue their case. Some of Pendarves's publications, perhaps most notably <span class="italic">Sighs</span>, can be read as subversive, but there is no evidence that he was ever personally involved in Fifth Monarchy plots.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, a proportion of Pendarves's historical importance is posthumous. As recounted by Wood and William Hughes, following his death in London from dysentery in early September 1656, his body was returned to Abingdon and his funeral, on 30 September and the two days immediately following, was the occasion for a millenarian demonstration of force, with inflammatory preaching and provocation of the protectorate authorities. The proceedings were brought to an end, amid mutual recriminations, by cavalry units brought in from Wallingford under the command of Major-General Bridge. It was under cover of this gathering that plans were laid for Venner's first Fifth Monarchist rising, which duly took place in the following April and was speedily crushed. The prophetess Anna Trapnel celebrated Pendarves as a saint who had died so as to plead directly with God for the second coming of Christ.<br>
<br>Pendarves's writings also showed mainstream puritan preoccupations. He wrote against luxury in dress and personal adornments (<span class="italic">Endeavours for the Reformation in Saints Apparel</span>, 1656), which was a particularly strong concern of the Western Association. A tract against the Quakers (<span class="italic">Some Queries</span>, 1656) brought a turgid denunciation from James Nayler (<span class="italic">An Answer</span>, 1656) and an elliptical attack from Denys Hollister (<span class="italic">The Skirts of the Whore Discovered</span>, 1656), who claimed that it was a plagiarism. In spite of rigorism on believers' baptism, Pendarves was on friendly terms with the moderate Baptist and millenarian Henry Jessey and took an interest in his schemes for calendar reform.<br>
<br>Pendarves married before 1647 Thomasine Newcomen [<a name="cosubject_69926"></a><span class="headword">Thomasine Pendarves</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1618, <em>d.</em> in or after 1671)], daughter of Thomas Newcomen and his wife, Bathsabe (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Philpott), of St Petrox, Dartmouth. She was baptized at Dartmouth on 13 September 1618. The Newcomens were a prominent Devon family, with interests in tin mines and in the exploitation of Ireland. It seems that Thomasine Pendarves was influential among the Abingdon Baptists even before her husband had abandoned the established church. However, her religion was of a more mystical nature than his, and she caused him embarrassment on several occasions, most seriously in 1649. The ranter Abiezer Coppe dedicated to Thomasine his first major work <span class="italic">Some Sweet Sips of some Spiritual Wine</span>, and published in it an exchange of correspondence he had had with her; her identity was hidden by the use of Hebrew letters but would have been clear to those learned enough to read them and familiar with local personalities. The letters show her as aspiring to the type of visionary prophecy practised by Coppe, and might also suggest an improper relationship between them. Another of her letters was published in the same year by her friend the political prophetess Elizabeth Poole in <span class="italic">An Alarum of War</span>. Thomasine had intercepted a letter to her husband from William Kiffin, instructing him to anathematize Poole from the pulpit. Her reply to Kiffin argued against his policy and insisted that, as she could not trust her husband to take the right decision in the matter, further dealings should be with her and not with him. Kiffin does not seem to have responded.<br>
<br>Pendarves and his wife had six known children, of whom at least three died in infancy. Thomasine Pendarves was resident in Abingdon until at least 1671, paying occasional fines for attending conventicles, but then disappears from the record.<br>
