<span class="headword">Trevaskis, Sir  (Gerald) Kennedy Nicholas</span>  (1915&#150;1990), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was born on 1 January 1915 at Hove, Sussex, the eldest of three children of Hugh Kennedy Trevaskis (1882&#150;1962), civil servant in India, and his wife, Eva Gwendolin Constance Mytanwy (1897&#150;1969), daughter of Captain Alfred Ephrot Tizard RN and Mytanwy Tizard. The early retirement of his father from the Indian Civil Service and his ordination in the Church of England gave Trevaskis and his siblings a truly happy family home from 1932 at the rectory, Rusper, Sussex.<br>
<br>Kennedy Trevaskis was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford, and then at Marlborough College from 1928 to 1933. He was a school prefect, a member of the cricket eleven in 1932 and 1933, and he was described as an extremely useful medium-fast bowler and good batsman. He studied at King's College, Cambridge, from 1933 to 1936, where he was captain of cricket in 1934&#150;6 and of rugby in 1934. He married Sheila James Harrington (<i>b</i>. 1920), daughter of Colonel F. J. Harrington, at the Brompton Oratory on 25 August 1945. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Trevaskis joined the colonial administrative service in Northern Rhodesia in 1938, at a time when that service was at the peak of its prestige; and the Northern Rhodesia regiment, initially as a sergeant, in September 1939, being taken prisoner by Italian forces in August 1940 in British Somaliland, following one of the last set-piece battles fought in Africa. He learned Italian and was thereby asked to join the British occupied enemy territory administration, Eritrea.<br>
<br>Trevaskis now showed his mettle. He was a big man, physically, but also mentally: to his work he brought a keen intellect, guided by academic rigour. The peoples of his first posting, the Keren, had a strong feudal structure. He presided with skill over mixed-culture tribunals dealing with complex land disputes; later, in his &#145;left-wing phase&#146;, he organized the freeing of the serfs of a combined Keren&#150;Agordat western province from their ancient feudal dues and services. He served in 1947&#150;8 as a member of the British delegation to the four-power commission on former Italian colonies. As political secretary and liaison officer, United Nations commission, he sought in 1950 to secure for Eritrea an independent future; but he was defeated by Haile Selassie's prestige and the United States' need of facilities in Eritrea, which he offered, to monitor communications across the Indian and Pacific oceans. Trevaskis's account of Britain's and his own stewardship is given in <span class="italic">A Colony in Transition: the British Occupation of Eritrea, 1941&#150;52</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Realizing that he could do nothing further, Trevaskis returned to Northern Rhodesia in 1948, becoming district commissioner of Ndola, headquarters of the immensely wealthy copperbelt region. In 1951 he transferred to the Aden protectorate as political officer, western Aden protectorate, becoming deputy British agent in 1952 and adviser and British agent in 1954. He was back in an environment, essentially Muslim, where his experience, personal qualities, and sympathies were at home.<br>
<br>Trevaskis's first success was the inauguration on 11 February 1959 of the Federation of South Arabia, for which he was appointed CMG. Three years later, largely due to the diplomatic skills of Trevaskis, exercised in fluent Arabic, Aden agreed to join the federation, a necessity if the federation were to cease to be economically dependent on Great Britain. Trevaskis became high commissioner on 16 August 1963 and was advanced to KCMG. Over the following year the colonial secretary, Duncan Sandys, worked at hectic pace, exhausting British officials and Arabian ministers, to bring the Aden&#150;South Arabia Federation to successful birth. This was bitterly opposed by President Nasser of Egypt: a hand grenade was thrown at Trevaskis at Aden airport in December 1963; two lives were lost, and he was wounded.<br>
<br>These efforts were aborted when in late 1964 the general election in Britain was won by the Labour Party, hostile to attempts to maintain British influence east of Suez, and to &#145;feudal and reactionary&#146; rulers, as one reviewer put it. Anthony Greenwood, Labour's colonial secretary, summoned Trevaskis home. While he waited to see the new minister, his successor, Sir Richard Turnbull, was being dispatched to Aden; Greenwood's order was that the press was to be given no information and that Turnbull's departure was to be secret. Trevaskis had his commission terminated on 23 November 1964.<br>
<br>Trevaskis was subsequently adviser to Sunningdale Oils and was much valued by them on account of his Arabian contacts. He maintained friendly contacts with several Arabian rulers, but his career was, at an age of not yet fifty, effectively at an end. He wrote the history of and the case for the policies he stood for: <span class="italic">Shades of Amber, a South Arabian Episode</span> (1968) must take its place beside his work on Eritrea as an evocative account of a lost cause. Both gave testimony to his sympathies for the intellectually advanced, though economically under-developed, peoples of the Horn of Africa.<br>
<br>Trevaskis's marriage, a sharing of thirty years abroad and in England, was greatly damaged by the effects of the Aden bombing. He and his wife finally parted in 1976, but did not divorce. Trevaskis had a stable and long-lasting relationship with a young widow, Valentine Sylvia Donovan (1935&#150;1997), who later took his name by deed poll. He bought the Old Rectory, Rusper, where he spent his last years.<br>
<br>In the 1980s, his first love, Eritrea, reclaimed Trevaskis. He became a valued adviser to the Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front, which in 1993 secured independence. He would have been a principal guest at a conference organized by the Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front at the beginning of March 1990, but that same March, during an operation for a suspected hiatus hernia, he was found to have extensive cancer. He died shortly after recovering consciousness on 4 March 1990 at Gatwick Park Hospital, near Crawley, Sussex, and was buried on 21 March in Rusper churchyard.<br>
