<span class="headword">Mangin,  Edward</span>  (1772&#150;1852), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born in Dublin on 15 July 1772, the eldest son of Samuel Henry Mangin (<i>d</i>. 1798) of the 5th Royal Irish Dragoons, afterwards lieutenant-colonel of the 14th, and finally of the 12th (Prince of Wales's) light dragoons, and his wife, Susanna Corneille (<i>d</i>. 1824). Both of his parents' families were Huguenot in origin; the Mangins had emigrated to Ireland to escape persecution during the reign of Louis XIV.<br>
<br>Mangin was a contemporary of Southey at Balliol College Oxford, graduating BA in 1793 and MA in 1795. He was then ordained in the Irish church, and on 2 March 1798 was collated to the prebendal stall of Dysart in Killaloe Cathedral, where he served until 15 January 1800. That year he married Emily Holmes (<i>d</i>. 1801), and was collated to the prebend of Rathmichael in St Patrick's, Dublin. A year later his wife died, leaving him with their baby daughter, Emily.<br>
<br>Mangin remained in Dublin until December 1803, when he became prebendary of Rath in Killaloe, a position he held until his death. Shortly after his move, his first translation, from the French, was published as <span class="italic">The Life of C. G. Lamoignon Malesherbes</span> (1804). It was followed the next year by <span class="italic">The Deserted City</span>, a poem on Bath in summer which parodied Goldsmith. At yearly intervals thereafter came <span class="italic">Light Reading at Leisure Hours</span> (1805), <span class="italic">Oddities and Outlines</span> (1806), and a three-decker novel, <span class="italic">George the Third</span> (1807). His <span class="italic">Essay on the Sources of the Pleasures Received from Literary Compositions</span> (1808) was reprinted in 1813.<br>
<br>Between 1810 and 1814 came a number of more significant works. Mangin's translation, <span class="italic">Hector, a Tragedy in Five Acts</span> was published in 1810; the nineteen-volume <span class="italic">Works of Samuel Richardson, with a Sketch of his Life and Writings</span> followed in 1811. <span class="italic">Utopia Found: an Apology for Irish Absentees</span> did not appear until 1813, but was followed by one of Mangin's best-known works, <span class="italic">A View of the Pleasures Arising from a Love of Books</span> (1814).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Mangin was navy chaplain on the <i>Gloucester</i>, a 74-gun ship, from April to August 1812. He lived in Toulouse for some time, and was in Paris when it was occupied by the allied armies; but for nearly the whole of his working life he lived at 10 Johnstone Street, Bath, &#145;associating with all the intelligent in that intelligent city&#146;  (Forster, <span class="italic">Goldsmith</span>). On 1 July 1816 at Queen Square Chapel, Bath, he married his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1845), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Nangreave of the East Indian army. They had a daughter, Mary Henrietta, and two sons who later became clergymen, Edward Nangreave Mangin, and Samuel W. Mangin.<br>
<br>Having a substantial income, Mangin was able to study full-time. He continued to publish, though often anonymously, a variety of original and translated works. <span class="italic">An Intercepted Epistle from a Person in Bath to his Friend in London</span> (1815) went into three editions within the year. His contributions to the <span class="italic">Bath Herald</span> during this period were later collected as <span class="italic">The Parlour Window, or, Anecdotes, Original Remarks on Books</span> (1841). He also gave articles to the <span class="italic">Bath and Bristol Magazine</span>, and issued a short-lived periodical called <span class="italic">The Inspector</span> (October&#150;November 1825). At the same time, he produced a variety of letters, translations, short stories, and other works. Most renowned among these was <span class="italic">Piozziana, or, Recollections of the Late Mrs Piozzi, by a Friend</span> (1833), of which, together with his edition of Richardson, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1853) commented: &#145;Upon neither of these works did he bestow a very large amount of labour or research&#146;. On the other hand, his contemporary biographers felt that his abilities were not fully realized in his works.<br>
<br>Mangin died in his sleep on the morning of 17 October 1852, at his house in Johnstone Street, Bath, having been for some time experiencing pain and swelling in his throat. He was buried in the old burial-ground of Bathwick.<br>
