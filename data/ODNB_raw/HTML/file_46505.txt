<span class="headword">Merry,  James</span>  (1805&#150;1877), <span class="occ">ironmaster and coalmaster</span>, was born at Nettleholes Farm in the parish of New Monkland, Lanarkshire, the son of James Merry, coalmaster, and Janet Creelman. His father was already in business in a small way as a colliery proprietor, supplying the Glasgow market along the recently opened Monkland Canal. Merry's early education was at the local parish schools in Langloan and Airdrie, followed from 1815 by attendance at Glasgow grammar school after his parents moved to Glasgow to control their mining concerns from an office opened at the canal basin at Port Dundas. He afterwards attended classes at Glasgow University, where he probably first met his future partner, Alexander Cunninghame, whose family already operated mines on the family lands of Craigends in Renfrewshire.<br>
<br>Merry began his business training as assistant to his father, learning from him in the 1820s all the practical aspects of mining, and details of accounts and leases. He was taken into partnership in 1831, and when his father retired in 1835 Merry was sole proprietor of the firm of James Merry Junior, coalmaster. During the next twenty years he built a large business empire, in partnership with Cunninghame. The opportunity came with the spectacular growth of the Scottish pig-iron trade following J. B. Neilson's innovation, in 1828, of the hot blast in the manufacture of iron. The Monklands area, where Merry held his mineral leases at the eastern end of the Monkland Canal, was rich in coal and iron seams and was also being opened up by Scotland's first railways. Seven new ironworks had opened in the area between 1828 and 1838, and Merry joined in partnership with Cunninghame and a Leith merchant, Alexander Allison, to raise the capital to open the Carnbroe Iron Works, operated by the new partnership of Allison &amp; Co. The opening of the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Ayr Railway in 1840 carried the new iron industry into Ayrshire, where in 1842 Allison &amp; Co. bought out the leases from an insolvent partnership which had partly erected blast furnaces at Glengarnock. Merry, Allison, and Cunninghame operated this venture as the Glengarnock Iron Company, and when Allison retired in 1845, the controlling firm became that of Merry and Cunninghame, which soon added a third ironworks at Ardeer in 1854. By then the firm operated three ironworks, twelve collieries, and numerous iron mines and was the second-largest producer of pig iron, and third in rank as colliery operators, in Scotland.<br>
<br>During this rapid expansion Merry was the dominant partner, daily in the offices of the works, and controlling every aspect of operations. He combined technical expertise with a detailed knowledge of local mineral leases, systematically negotiating a mineral bank of leasehold agreements with landowners in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire. He was forceful, even ruthless in business, and had a reputation for aggressiveness in management, regularly breaking strikes at his works by importing highland and Irish labour. His companies were the most notorious operators of truck shops in the mining districts, controlling one-third of those operating in Scotland.<br>
<br>By the early 1860s daily management was in the hands of Cunninghame and his cousin, John, for from 1855 Merry had used his industrial wealth to develop other interests; indeed from 1866, when Alexander Cunninghame died, John Cunninghame was in partnership with Merry and ran the business. In 1847, aged forty-two, Merry had married Anne McHardie, whose father, James McHardie, was sheriff-clerk of Glasgow and owner of the Cleddens estate near Glenboig, Lanarkshire, another rich coal and iron area; they had two sons. The marriage was his entr&eacute;e into Glasgow society, as his wife was a noted beauty and socialite. The following year Alexander Cunninghame married Anne's sister, binding the families in ties that were more than commercial.<br>
<br>Merry's ambitions, however, were wider still and developed in parallel with his consuming passion for horse-racing. He had been a figure on the Scottish racing circuits from the 1830s, but in 1855, the year he opened Ardeer, he also purchased the famous yellow and black racing colours left free on the death of the marquess of Westminster. That year he won the Two Thousand Guineas for the first time with Lord of the Isles, his first son was born, and he and his family moved from their house in Athole Place, Glasgow, to their new residence, Culdees Castle, at Auchterarder in Perthshire. About 1857 they moved again, to their estate of Belladrum at Beauly, Inverness-shire.<br>
<br>From this platform Merry contested Glasgow as a Liberal in 1857 and lost. Later that year he fought and won the Falkirk burghs, defeating George Baird of Gartsherrie in a contest that was the subject of a petition to the House of Commons on grounds of corrupt practices during the election. Merry was unseated, but in 1859 he regained the house and served continuously as MP for the Falkirk burghs until his retiral at the general election of 1874, when he was already in ill health. London society was opened up to him through his Westminster seat, and during the period from 1859 to 1875 he developed a highly successful stable, winning virtually every major race, including twice taking the St Leger and Two Thousand Guineas, and the Derby; he also won the Oaks. In London he based himself at his residence in Eaton Square, and enjoyed membership of Brooks's and the Reform Club.<br>
<br>In ill health in 1874, Merry attempted to take advantage of the new joint stock legislation to convert the partnership to a public company with &pound;1.5 million capital to purchase the partners' shares. The flotation collapsed with the ending of the mid-Victorian boom in 1873&#150;4, and Merry was obliged to repurchase the issued shares at par, the company reverting to co-partnery. This coincided with his sale of his stables, which realized 21,650 guineas. With this reverse he retired from the partnership, which had received less and less of his attention in the twenty years since he had taken to country living and enjoying his life as an MP and a horse-racing patron. In Inverness-shire he was a deputy lieutenant of the county and also a justice of the peace.<br>
<br>The dominant partner in Merry and Cunninghame, Merry created a business empire which ranked second only to the Bairds of Gartsherrie among the coal and iron dynasties of mid-nineteenth-century Scotland. Nevertheless, when he died on 3 February 1877, it was at his London home, 68 Eaton Square, far from the grime of the coal and iron districts of the west of Scotland. He was survived by his wife.<br>
