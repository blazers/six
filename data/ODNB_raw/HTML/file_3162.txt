<span class="headword">Brackenbury, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1485), <span class="occ">knight</span>, was the second son of Ralph Brackenbury of Denton in the parish of Gainford, co. Durham. The nearby lordship of Barnard Castle was held by Richard, duke of Gloucester, in the right of his wife, Anne Neville, from 1474, and Robert Brackenbury had probably entered the duke's service by 1477, when ducal retainers witnessed his father's grant to him of land in School Aycliffe, co. Durham. By 1479 Brackenbury was treasurer of Gloucester's household and one of the duke's feoffees. Two years later, in 1481, he acquired the manor of Selaby, co. Durham. Brackenbury's prospects were transformed by Gloucester's accession in 1483. He was not at Richard's coronation, but less than a fortnight later, on 17 July, he was made constable of the Tower of London for life and master of the mint and keeper of the king's exchange in the Tower&#151;one of relatively few northerners to receive major office in the south so early in the reign.<br>
<br>Brackenbury was thus constable of the Tower when Richard is believed to have ordered the death of his nephews, Edward V and Richard, duke of York, although no chronicler associates him directly with their deaths. Early writers give no details, and the version current after the execution of Sir James Tyrell in 1502 was that Brackenbury had hesitated to carry out their murder, and Richard accordingly commanded Tyrell to kill them. The most that can be said is that the scale of Brackenbury's subsequent reward makes it unlikely that his role in the affair had offended the king.<br>
<br>After Buckingham's rebellion of October 1483, which involved many of Edward IV's local servants, Richard used land and office forfeited by the rebels to move trusted northern associates into the areas most badly affected by the rising. In March 1484, Brackenbury, by now an esquire of the king's body, was given extensive land in Kent for his good service against the rebels. One of the manors, Ightham Mote, apparently became his home in the county. He was added to the Kent commissions of the peace in July 1484 and was made sheriff in November. He was also made receiver-general of the forfeited lands and goods of rebels in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. His local influence was recognized by Archbishop Thomas Bourchier, who made Brackenbury his steward in March 1484. Brackenbury and his wife, Agnes, were enrolled within the confraternity of Christ Church, Canterbury.<br>
<br>Brackenbury was evidently regarded as one of the king's most reliable supporters in the south-east, and his range of activities kept him busy. In July 1484 he was forced to delegate responsibilities because of &#145;other arduous business touching the king's right&#146;  (TNA: PRO, KB 9/951/28). In addition to his local offices he was one of Richard's commissioners in the office of admiral and a royal councillor. He was knighted around Christmas 1484 and became a knight of the king's body. He continued to receive royal patronage, and by the end of the reign his gains from royal service were probably of the order of &pound;500 p.a., which made him one of the best-rewarded of Richard's household servants. Not all his gains came directly from the king. A fellow knight of the body, the Essex landowner Sir Thomas Montgomery, made over one of his own offices to him, while the rebel John Forster escaped attainder in 1483 by conveying land to Brackenbury, and early in the next reign Margaret Beaufort was seeking to recover silver and gilt cups which Brackenbury had taken. His influence was recognized by the scholar Pietro Carmeliano of Brescia, who dedicated his poem on St Catherine to him.<br>
<br>Brackenbury fought in Richard's army at Bosworth and was killed there on 22 August 1485. He was attainted, and his land forfeited, in the first parliament of Henry VII. The attainder was reversed in 1489 in favour of his two daughters, Anne and Elizabeth. Brackenbury's bastard children were explicitly denied any immediate share in the restoration, although his illegitimate son was to inherit if Anne and Elizabeth died childless. That son was still alive in 1499 when he was bequeathed &pound;40 in the will of Thomas Barowe, who had been Gloucester's chancellor, but there is no record of his death. Elizabeth, still unmarried, made her will in 1504. She then held Selaby, which she ordered to be sold by her feoffees, and the money to be used to pay her debts, including those to the dowager duchess of Norfolk, Elizabeth Talbot, &#145;to whom I am especially bound&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/14, fol. 163<i>v</i>). There is no mention in the will of her sister, Anne.<br>
