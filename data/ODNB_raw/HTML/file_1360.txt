<span class="headword">Bardolf,  Thomas</span>, fifth Baron Bardolf  (1369&#150;1408), <span class="occ">landowner and rebel</span>, was born at Birling, Kent, on 22 December 1369, the son of William, fourth Baron Bardolf (1349&#150;1386), and his wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1403), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22684/', "Michael Poynings, first Lord Poynings (c.1318&#150;1369)")</script>. His father died on 29 January 1386, and for the rest of his minority Thomas Bardolf seems to have been in the custody of his father-in-law, Ralph, Lord Cromwell, whose daughter Amice he had married by 8 July 1382. Their two daughters were both born at Cromwell's castle of Tattershall, Lincolnshire, in 1389 and 1390 respectively. In the latter year Thomas Bardolf made proof of age and had livery of his father's lands, which were centred upon Wormegay in Norfolk; however, these were much diminished by his mother's dower, and by joint settlements which gave her a life interest in other estates. On 7 September 1391 he was called to parliament for the first time, and thereafter received regular summonses. But he seems to have played little part in public affairs in England, and was appointed to very few commissions. Described by Walsingham as &#145;a man vigorous in arms, and in bodily shape and stature second to none in the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Johannis de Trokelowe</span>, 402), he preferred to occupy himself overseas. In May 1392 he was licensed to go abroad. He accompanied Richard II's expedition to Ireland of 1394&#150;5. In 1396 he was licensed to travel abroad again, and in 1397 he went overseas on the king's service, presumably to Gascony. In 1399 he once more went with Richard II to Ireland, and was robbed in Wales on his return.<br>
<br>Initially Bardolf appears to have accepted the usurpation of Henry IV, and served in the expedition of 1400 to Scotland. For his part, Henry seems to have tried to gain Bardolf's support, appointing him to commissions in Norfolk, and summoning him to parliaments and councils. On 24 May 1400 he renewed for Bardolf the grant of 100 marks per annum made in 1319 by Edward II to Bardolf's great-grandfather Sir Roger Damory. But ultimately Bardolf was not to be won over to the Lancastrian cause. He may have retained Ricardian sympathies. The effect of his annuity was probably vitiated by the difficulties he experienced in obtaining his money, requiring repeated instructions to the exchequer and reissues of tallies. He is unlikely to have viewed with equanimity the new regime's use of the duchy of Lancaster estates in East Anglia to build up the crown's position there at the expense of local magnates like himself. And he evidently came under the influence of the earl of Northumberland. There may have been a connection between the Percys and the Bardolfs dating from the mid-fourteenth century, when Thomas Percy was bishop of Norwich&#151;at his death in 1369 Bishop Percy bequeathed a cup engraved with the Bardolf arms. But the links later became closer; when Bardolf's mother died, on 12 June 1403, she appointed Northumberland and her son to be overseers of her will.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Bardolf took part in the Percy revolt of 1403, but in 1405 he committed himself to treasonable courses. He opposed royal policy in councils held at London and St Albans, and one chronicle even makes him the instigator of the scheme of February that year for a tripartite division of England between Northumberland, Owain Glyn D&#373;r, and Edmund (IV) Mortimer. When in May Henry IV summoned him to campaign in Wales, Bardolf slipped away secretly and made his way north, to join Northumberland. Like the earl, he failed to support Archbishop Scrope's rising, and, following its defeat, the two men fled to Scotland. When Bardolf was formally declared a traitor in the parliament of December 1406, it was claimed that it was on his advice that the earl of Northumberland had entered into treasonous negotiations with the Scots and French. By then, however, the Scots had proved untrustworthy allies, and in the summer of 1406, after receiving warning of a conspiracy to hand them over to Henry IV, Bardolf and Northumberland fled to Wales. There they had the support of Glyn D&#373;r, and were able to raise a small force, but this was defeated by Edward Charlton, and they moved on again, to France and the Low Countries. Raising money by pawning their jewels, they visited Paris, but their hopes of French support were dashed by the opposition of the duke of Orl&eacute;ans, and they made their way to Bruges. By the end of 1407 they were back in Scotland.<br>
<br>According to John Hardyng, Bardolf and Northumberland were now &#145;with all thair hertes fayne Thaym to submytte unto the kynge agayne&#146;  (BL, MS Lansdowne 204, fol. 207<i>v</i>). But the conciliatory mood passed, and early in 1408 they invaded England with such men as they could gather, hoping to exploit the prevailing discontent with King Henry's government to arouse a rebellion. The Scottish nobles, according to one account, waved them off with the words &#145;Go ahead, you have England with you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eulogium historiarum</span>, 3.411). Words and events flattered to deceive. At first the invaders met with no resistance. When they reached Thirsk they presented themselves as liberators, and called upon those who desired freedom from oppressive government to join them. Some men did enlist, and thus reinforced Bardolf and Northumberland resumed their advance. But they found their way blocked by the sheriff of Yorkshire, Sir Thomas Rokeby, at the head of the county levies, and were finally brought to battle on 19 February on Bramham Moor, near Tadcaster, where their forces were routed. Northumberland was killed, and Bardolf, severely wounded, was captured, and died later that day. Bardolf's head was sent to Lincoln, while his quarters were displayed in London, York, Bishop's Lynn, and Shrewsbury. On 13 April 1408 his remains were delivered to his widow for burial. Bardolf's heirs were his two daughters, Anne, who married successively Sir William Clifford and Reginald, Lord Cobham, and Joan, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50244/', "Sir William Phelip")</script>, who later styled himself Lord Bardolf. Many of their father's estates were at first distributed among the king's supporters, but most of them were later recovered. Bardolf's widow, secured in her dower, lived until 1 July 1421.<br>
