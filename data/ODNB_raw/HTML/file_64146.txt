<span class="headword">Haldane,  Patrick</span>  (1683/4&#150;1769), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the second son of John Haldane of Gleneagles (1660&#150;1721) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1685), daughter of David Drummond, third Lord Madderty, and Lady Beatrix Graham. He came from an ancient family, settled at Gleneagles since the fifteenth century. His father, a zealous whig, had represented Perthshire and Dunbartonshire in the parliament of Scotland, and represented Perthshire in the first parliament of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Haldane matriculated at St Andrews University on 22 February 1699, graduated MA on 11 July 1701, and then spent four years reading law in Edinburgh under the eminent lawyer John Spottiswood. In 1705 he became professor of Greek at St Andrews. This appointment was not without difficulty, for though he obtained more votes than his rival for the post he was not selected, and succeeded only after taking the matter to court where the election was annulled. No reason was given for his being supplanted in the first instance, but it appears to have been an early example of the extraordinary unpopularity which he attracted and which was later to blight what was otherwise a most promising career. This first appointment was followed in 1707 by the post of professor of ecclesiastical history.<br>
<br>In 1711 Haldane left St Andrews for the University of Leiden to resume his legal studies, remaining there for about four years. After completing his studies he returned home, and on 18 January 1715 was admitted advocate. The following two years were noteworthy: on 16 February 1715 he was returned as MP to represent (as a whig) the Perth district of burghs, a position he held until 1721; and in November 1715 was appointed a commissioner of the equivalent. In October 1716 he was elected provost of St Andrews, retaining this office until October 1720, and in May 1716 he exchanged his commissioner's post for that of a member of the commission charged with arranging the sale of estates forfeited after the 1715 Jacobite rising. The salary of &pound;1000 per annum was considered enormous, but was scant compensation for the exceptional enmity he incurred from the Jacobites and other prominent landowners connected with the dispossessed families. To the inherently unpopular nature of this post Haldane added a ruthless enthusiasm for his duties, earning himself a lifelong reputation for severity and harshness, and lack of Scottish patriotism. Nor was his unpopularity confined to the Scots; the whig ministry also came to disapprove of his overzealous approach.<br>
<br>In the Commons, Haldane voted consistently with the government, but here too there was ample scope for his ability to attract enmity. His speeches are said to have rendered him obnoxious for most of his life. On one occasion at least his vote seemed calculated to incur hatred: having voted in favour of a petition to allow the wives and widows of forfeited estate owners in England their jointures, he opposed a similar proposal for their Scottish counterparts.<br>
<br>Some time before 1721 Haldane married Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1694), daughter of William, fourth Lord Forrester; soon afterwards their son, George, was born, followed by a daughter, Margaret. Domestic happiness, however, was quickly overshadowed by fresh controversy in his career. On the conclusion of the forfeited estates commission's work Haldane had returned to the bar, but, obtaining little work on account of the prejudice against him, put himself forward for a seat on the bench. In December 1721 he succeeded in obtaining the king's nomination to be a judge of the court of session, but this raised a furious outcry from his numerous enemies. The Faculty of Advocates, determined to prevent his appointment, caused the court of session to refuse him admission on a technicality. The House of Lords overruled this decision, whereupon his opponents raised fresh objections, accusing him, <i>inter alia</i>, of Jacobitism, bribery, and extortion by threats. The court of session now voted to admit Haldane by eight votes to seven, but two of his supporters were extraordinary (honorary) lords of session and their right to vote was promptly challenged. Again the case was referred to London, where in view of the controversy a reluctant George I withdrew the judgeship nomination for an alternative preferment. Haldane bore with remarkable fortitude this crushing blow, and on 30 May 1724 the promised preferment materialized, in the form of a commissionership of excise in England, which he held until its termination on George II's accession in 1727.<br>
<br>Haldane again returned to the bar, with greater success, acquiring a reputation of being &#145;not only the best election-monger, but the best election lawyer of his time&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>) and on 5 March 1746 he was appointed joint solicitor-general of Scotland. In 1750, weakened by age, he made an unsuccessful application for a judgeship, pleading that advancing years were diminishing his ability to cope with the rigours of the bar. Further applications also failed, and he retired in 1755, much broken, on a pension.<br>
<br>In retirement Haldane suffered further pain. His wife had died some time before 3 February 1747, and in 1759 he was to bear the sorrow of the death of his son, George, soon to be followed by that of his daughter, Margaret. His grief was heightened by the necessity in 1760 of selling the family estate of Gleneagles, recently inherited from his brother Mungo, to pay his son's and his own debts, in both cases incurred through electioneering expenses. He died on 10 January 1769 at Duddingston manse, Duddingston, Edinburgh, and was buried in the vault of Sir Alexander Dick, bt, at Duddingston cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
