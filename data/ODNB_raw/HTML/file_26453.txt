<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander</span>, duke of Albany  (1454?&#150;1485), <span class="occ">magnate and rebel</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14588/', "James II, king of Scots (1430&#150;1460)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18249/', "Mary of Gueldres (d. 1463)")</script>. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but 1454 seems likely. Between 18 July 1455 and 3 July 1458 James II bestowed on him the earldom of March, the lordships of Annandale and Man, the wardenship of the marches, and the dukedom of Albany, giving him an impressive power base in the east and west borders, centred on Dunbar Castle. In June 1460 he travelled to the continent, to further his princely education, and he seems to have spent most of his time with his mother's family in Gueldres. On his return, before 8 July 1464, he was captured in the North Sea by English pirates in a violent skirmish, and was detained by Edward IV for a further year. Aged just fourteen, Albany may have been involved in an attempt to overthrow the Boyd faction, with his half-uncle the earl of Atholl and the lord of Auchterhouse (later earl of Buchan), in late 1468 or early 1469.<br>
<br>In April 1474 Albany was sent to Lauder to lead the Scottish host against a feared invasion by Richard, duke of Gloucester. His previously good relations with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III")</script>, his elder brother, ended after 26 October 1474, when the king agreed a permanent alliance with England. As a border magnate, much of Albany's ability to provide patronage involved his willingness to allow his followers to raid into England. The alliance technically put an end to this, upsetting a long-standing border way of life. However, there is evidence that Albany continued to be involved in border raiding: Edward IV would complain in 1480 about Scottish truce breaking and murders, specifically implying the participation of the march wardens, and Albany's indictment for treason in October 1479 claimed he had taken part in the &#145;treasonable hurting, violacioune and breking of the trewis and pece&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 126). Blind Hary's strongly anti-English poem <span class="italic">The Wallace</span> (<i>c</i>.1478), written with the involvement of Albany's closest ally, his steward Sir James Liddale of Halkerston, is critical of the 1474 marriage alliance and implies that Albany would make a more able king than his brother. Other actions would have made the duke popular with his own affinity but not with the king. He twice deprived rivals of land on behalf of members of his own affinity, and then demanded non-entry fines in fact due to the crown; he allowed two of his tenants to hold an illegal court on their lands to decide a dispute in their own favour; while his parliamentary indictment in 1479 accused him of &#145;art and part in the Cruell slauchter of Johne of Skougale&#146;  (ibid.), a royal official in Haddingtonshire. The upshot was that James III tried to push Albany into collaborating with his foreign diplomacy. In 1477 he included Albany in proposals designed to strengthen the English marriage alliance, and on 9 March 1478 Albany was forced to divorce his first wife, Katherine Sinclair, daughter of the earl of Orkney, for similar reasons. They had married about 1470 and had four children. Thereafter Albany refused to co-operate with the king's plans, and this defiance may have finally provoked the king into retaliation by besieging Dunbar Castle in April 1479. Albany fled to France, a disastrous outcome for James III, made worse when successive assizes of parliament between 3 October 1479 and 4 February 1482 repeatedly refused to forfeit the duke for treason.<br>
<br>In France, Albany received many favours from Louis XI, most notably marriage to Anne de la Tour (<i>d</i>. 1512), the daughter of the count of Auvergne, in 1480. Their son John was Albany's heir and future governor for James V. Albany's position in France was a considerable threat to James III, as he saw the Anglo-Scottish alliance collapse into war, and growing domestic antipathy to his kingship. In March 1482 parliament sent an embassy to France, ostensibly to ask for help against England. In reality it is likely that the embassy hatched a conspiracy with Albany, as it included the earls of Buchan and Angus and the bishop of Dunkeld, who would form the core of Albany's administration in late 1482. Albany thereafter travelled from France to England, and on 10 June described himself as &#145;Allexander, king of Scotlande&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 12.156) for the first time&#151;probably the price of Edward IV's support, rather than a serious ambition to usurp the Scottish throne. The next day he signed the treaty of Fotheringhay with the English king, which promised him the crown of Scotland in return for homage and handing over Berwick and extensive parts of the Scottish marches. With Richard of Gloucester and a 20,000 strong army Albany entered Scotland in July 1482, taking Berwick, probably by arrangement with Lord Gray, one of his supporters. James III, meanwhile, led his army to Lauder, where on 22 July he was seized and incarcerated in Edinburgh Castle (in the custody of Lord Darnley) by his nobility, some of whom were undoubtedly allies of Albany, while others wanted to avoid a disastrous military confrontation with the English.<br>
<br>Albany and Gloucester reached Edinburgh soon afterwards, but the king was held in the castle by Albany's allies&#151;Buchan, Atholl, and Darnley&#151;and while the English army remained, the king was not released. Thus when Gloucester and his army went south on 11 August, Albany was able to claim, as Edward IV admitted, that he had prevented widespread English devastation, and also that he and his fellow conspirators had prevented the military defeat and capture of the king which James's own policies had provoked.<br>
<br>Albany's duplicity had left him in a strong position. Between August and September 1482 he seems to have gained the support of Queen Margaret at Stirling, returning to Edinburgh and securing the release of James III from the castle through a nominal siege on 29 September. By 10 October Albany had formed a new regime, based on the support of the earls of Buchan and Atholl, the bishops of Dunkeld and Glasgow, and the bishop-elect of Moray, and had made himself lieutenant-general. King in all but name, Albany until this point had acted with considerable ability and had achieved notable success. His greatest error came when he styled himself earl of Mar (before 10 October). George Gordon, second earl of Huntly, had long-standing ambitions in Mar, and by taking the earldom Albany brought Huntly back to the side of the king.<br>
<br>At the parliament of 2 December 1482 Albany could not obtain confirmation of his lieutenant-generalship. It is likely that Huntly led the opposition on behalf of the king. Moreover, between 19 October 1482 and 10 January 1483 James III managed to recover the support of Darnley, Atholl, and the bishop of Dunkeld. By 30 December Albany had fled to Dunbar, his ambitions temporarily defeated, yet he continued to have the support of a significant number of important figures. On 2 January 1483 he made another attempt to seize the king, and again it was probably Huntly, still in Edinburgh, who provided the strength to resist Albany. James was too weak to deal effectively with his brother, who on 12 January sent Angus, Gray, and Liddale to treat with Edward IV to gain new military aid. On 11 February, Edward IV promised further assistance, once more greatly endangering James III. By 21 February, Albany had developed an impressive court at Dunbar, with Buchan, Lord Boyd, Lord Crichton, the master of Morton, Sir John Maxwell of Calderwood, John Liddale, David Lindsay, and many lesser men from the south-east border region. On 19 March, James III had to make a humiliating indenture with Albany in an attempt to safeguard his position, promising full remission for Albany and his accomplices in return for Albany's renouncing allegiance to Edward IV and any claim to be lieutenant-general. Albany's treasons continued, though, and it was only the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, throwing England into the confusion of a minority government, that left Albany open to attack. By early May he had let an English garrison into Dunbar and fled to England. He was finally forfeited on 8 July.<br>
<br>Albany's career was far from over. In July 1484 he went back to Scotland once again, with the long exiled earl of Douglas, and was still able to muster a number of his allies from 1482&#150;3, most notably the bishop-elect of Moray. However, he almost certainly had no aid from Richard III. The English king was seeking agreement with James III for a truce and marriage alliance before the invasion, and seems to have prevented Albany and Douglas from returning to the obvious starting point of Dunbar. Thus the invasion was forced onto the west march, where Albany's support had always been weakest and Douglas's affinity was long superseded. They were defeated in battle at Lochmaben on 22 July. Douglas was captured, but Albany escaped again into England.<br>
<br>Although it used to be thought that this was Albany's last incursion into Scotland, it now appears he made a final return in the summer of 1485, in the company of Sir James Liddale of Halkerston and with the help of Liddale's son, John. This return, however, seems to have been low-key, perhaps in the hope of a peaceful compromise with the king. A superficially unlikely account by Adam Abell, a Jedburgh friar, in his &#145;Roit and Quheill of Tyme&#146; of 1533 (NL Scot., MS 1746) can be corroborated by contemporary evidence. According to Abell, Albany &#145;quietly &hellip; staw out of ingland&#146;  (fol. 111<i>r</i>), was captured, placed in Edinburgh Castle, and escaped by killing his keeper, Henry Livingston of Manerston (an event dated wrongly by later chroniclers to 1479). Livingston, a minor royal official known to have bought gunpowder for the king, was certainly dead by 14 October 1485, and it is known that Sir James Liddale was captured and executed soon after 7 September. Following this final escape Albany fled back to France, where he was killed a few months later in a joust in Paris; he was buried in the city's Celestine church.<br>
<br>The notion that after 1483 Albany was discredited in Scotland has little basis in evidence; instead it is likely that the rebels of 1488 used Albany's popularity as part of the justification for their actions. Sympathetic accounts of his behaviour were certainly being written long before the return of his son in 1515. Albany had been a focus of opposition to an unpopular king and had exploited his standing with skill, creating an instability at the heart of James III's government that extended beyond the grave.<br>
