<span class="headword">Weaver,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">politician and government official</span>, is thought to have been born of a family in the north of England. One suggestion is that his father kept an inn; another that his parents, whose names are unknown, were in financial difficulties. Nothing is known of his early years and he first emerged into public life in 1631 when he became a freeman of the borough of Stamford. Subsequently he sat for the town in parliament. It is possible, but not certain, that he had a legal education, since during the 1640s he was appointed judge advocate in the parliamentarian army. He next appeared as a supporter of parliament in the civil war, rising in the eastern association to be its treasurer. In 1645 he took the side of Oliver Cromwell when he attacked the commander of the association, the earl of Manchester. He was said to share Cromwell's religious preferences, being recorded as a zealous supporter of the Independents. Later, however, he was supposed to incline more towards the presbyterians. In 1645 he was elected as a recruiter MP for Stamford. In the ensuing controversies he took the side of the army and opposed those who sued for peace with Charles I. Towards the end of 1648 he was calling for the trial of the king, but when he found himself named to the high court he refused to sit. Nevertheless, he quickly rallied to the new republican regime, returning to the purged House of Commons early in 1649. In parliament he energetically promoted measures designed to achieve religious and moral reform.<br>
<br>The administrative abilities which Weaver had revealed during the 1640s, together with political alliances with the important, notably Cromwell, brought his appointment as one of the parliamentary commissioners to whom the government of a reconquered Ireland was entrusted in 1649. Among his other services he attracted his brother-in-law, the minister, Samuel Winter, to Dublin, where he was soon installed as provost of Trinity College. Later Weaver wrote a posthumous life of Winter. In the Rump Parliament he also forwarded measures to spread protestantism in Ireland. He acquired permanent Irish links through a marriage into the family of one of the leading merchants of Dublin, Daniel Hutchinson, who also favoured the religious Independents. Weaver was among those MPs who successfully opposed the appointment of John Lambert to be lord deputy in Ireland. This position was in line with his staunch championing of civilian government. But he incurred the hostility of the army in Ireland, and early in 1653 resigned from his Irish office.<br>
<br>Thereafter Weaver gravitated towards the commonwealthsmen, such as Sir Henry Vane. Returned to parliament in 1654 and 1656, again for Stamford, he was secluded on the second occasion on account of his supposed estrangement from the Cromwellian protectorate. He was suspected of using his residual contacts in Ireland to encourage the opponents there of Cromwell's regime. In 1659, once more member for Stamford, he joined the republicans opposed to Richard Cromwell's government. When the commonwealthsmen briefly returned to power he was included in the council of state in December 1659, and was named to the new commission to govern Ireland. He neither acted as a councillor nor travelled to Dublin to assume the appointment. However, his earlier services had been rewarded with lands in Ireland, some of which he retained after the restoration of Charles II. These gave him an interest in the town of Maryborough, Queen's county, where he&#151;or his son&#151;was identified with the sectarian and political opponents of the returned Stuart monarchy. Despite these sympathies he escaped any serious punishment after 1660, and seems to have lived in relative obscurity, mainly in the environs of Stamford. He died in March 1685 probably at North Luffenham, Rutland, where he was buried on the 25th.<br>
