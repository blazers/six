<span class="headword">Gilchrist,  Percy Carlyle</span>  (1851&#150;1935), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born in Lyme Regis on 27 December 1851, the elder son (there were also two daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10712/', "Alexander Gilchrist (1828&#150;1861)")</script>, barrister and writer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10713/', "Anne Gilchrist, n&#233;e Burrows (1828&#150;1885)")</script>, biographer and essayist, daughter of John Parker Burrows, solicitor. His boyhood was first spent in Guildford and then, from 1856 to 1862, in Chelsea, in the house next door to Thomas and Jane Carlyle, who became close friends. Despite his literary and artistic upbringing Percy Gilchrist embarked upon a scientific career. Unlike his cousin, Alexander's nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27239/', "Sidney Gilchrist Thomas (1850&#150;1885)")</script>, with whom he was to collaborate, Gilchrist received a complete education, first at Felsted School, and then at the Royal School of Mines (1868&#150;71), where he trained as a metallurgist and analytical chemist and was Murchison medallist in July 1870. He subsequently gained membership of the institutes of civil and mechanical engineers. His first post was that of analytical chemist at an ironworks at Cwmafan in Glamorgan. In 1876 he took a similar position at the Blaenafon ironworks in Monmouthshire under the management of Edward Martin.<br>
<br>In 1875 Thomas hit upon a way of removing phosphorus from iron ores in the process developed by Henry Bessemer for the manufacture of steel. To test his idea, Thomas persuaded Gilchrist to carry out experiments during his leisure hours at the Blaenafon works. On learning their secret, Martin agreed to pay for further development and the cost of the patents taken out on the dephosphorization process in 1877 and 1878. On publication of the process in 1879 Gilchrist moved to Middlesbrough to help perfect the dolomite (magnesium limestone) liner for the converter in the works of Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co. In 1881 Gilchrist and Thomas developed their own steelworks, North Eastern Steel Company, at Middlesbrough. When this was sold to Dorman, Long &amp; Co. in 1903 Gilchrist retired from active work in metallurgy. Between 1882 and 1894 he was also chairman of the Basic and Dephosphorizing Patents Company, which was set up to safeguard the many patentees with interests in the dephosphorization process and the agricultural disposal of the phosphorus-rich basic slag.<br>
<br>Gilchrist was elected FRS in 1891. He was a vice-president of the Iron and Steel Institute (1891), a member of the Society of Chemical Industry, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. In 1887 he married Norah Augusta Mara, the second daughter of Captain Lewis Roper Fitzmaurice RN. They had a son and daughter. Although when awarded the Bessemer medal in 1883 Thomas acknowledged Gilchrist's &#145;unwearied exertions, conspicuous energy and ability&#146;, Gilchrist was always overshadowed by his romantic, inventive cousin, his vivacious mother, and his talented brother, the painter Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist. In later life he was an invalid.<br>
<br>Gilchrist died at his home, The Grove, Pinner, Middlesex, on 15 December 1935, having survived his cousin by fifty years. His wife outlived him.<br>
