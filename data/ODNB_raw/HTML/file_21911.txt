<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perceval,  John</span>, first earl of Egmont  (1683&#150;1748), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was born at Burton, co. Cork, on 12 July 1683, the second son of Sir John Perceval, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1686), and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1692), the fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37354/', "Sir Edward Dering, second baronet")</script>, of Surrenden Dering, Kent. Following the death of their father in 1686 at the age of twenty-nine, John Perceval and his brothers Edward and Philip were placed in the care of a great-uncle, Sir Robert Southwell, of King's Weston in England. Their mother remarried in 1690 but two years later died in childbirth. Upon the death of his elder brother, Edward, at the age of nine, in November 1691, the eight-year-old John Perceval became the fifth baronet.<br>
<br>John Perceval and his younger brother, Philip, grew up in England under the guardianship of Sir Robert Southwell and, following his death in 1702, that of his son Sir Edward Southwell. After private tuition at home, and three years at Mr Demouere's academy in Westminster, Perceval matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in November 1699. He left Oxford in 1701 without taking his degree but the following year, probably because of his great-uncle's influence, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Between 1704 and 1707 he travelled in England, Ireland, and continental Europe. He married on 10 June 1710 Catherine (1687/8&#150;1749), the eldest daughter of Sir Philip Parker &agrave; Morley bt, of Erwarton, Suffolk. They had seven children, three sons and four daughters, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21912/', "John Perceval")</script> and his sisters Catherine and Helena reached adulthood. Perceval paid periodic visits to Ireland, and lived there between 1711 and 1714, but chose to make London his main residence.<br>
<br>In 1704, at the age of twenty-one, Perceval inherited the 22,000 acres of land in Cork and Tipperary which provided him with a healthy income for the rest of his life. In that same year he also embarked on his political career when he was returned to the Irish House of Commons as the member for County Cork. Later in 1704 he was sworn of the privy council in Ireland. In 1713 he was re-elected as the member for County Cork and two years later, after first refusing it on the grounds that it was inferior to its English equivalent, he accepted the Irish title of Baron Perceval of Burton in the county of Cork. He took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 12 November 1715. Perceval had been led to believe by his friends in government and court circles that this Irish honour would shortly be followed by the English barony which he so craved, but this was not to be. However, in 1723 he was created Viscount Perceval of Kanturk, also in the county of Cork.<br>
<br>Although deeply disappointed by his failure to secure an English title, Perceval was immensely proud of the Irish honours bestowed on him. In 1719, and again in 1733, he was at the forefront of those Irish peers who tried to prevent either royal or parliamentary erosion of their authority. The stand taken by Perceval did not irreparably damage either his reputation or his career. He assiduously continued to cultivate the support of influential persons in the highest social and political circles, and he remained on the very best terms with the prince of Wales, later George II, Queen Caroline, and Sir Robert Walpole. Perceval became active in English politics during the 1720s. In 1727 he spent around &pound;1000 to secure his election as MP for Harwich, but stood down in the election of 1734 in favour of his eldest son, John. Mainly because of the Walpole ministry's deep dislike of him, the young Perceval was defeated. Although his father never forgave Walpole for this affront, the prime minister remained relatively cordial towards Perceval.<br>
<br>In 1729 Perceval sat on the parliamentary gaols committee chaired by James Edward Oglethorpe, and the subsequent close collaboration between the two men was instrumental in the founding of the colony of Georgia. Perceval's interest in the Americas had been kindled in 1708 when, on a visit to Ireland, he met George Berkeley. They became firm friends and, when Perceval returned to England, they embarked on a lengthy correspondence. Perceval was impressed by Berkeley's plan to found a colony in Bermuda for the training of Anglican missionaries and, although that plan came to nothing, Perceval retained his interest in the Americas. He was an early and an enthusiastic supporter of Oglethorpe's scheme to establish a new colony on the North American mainland, and he used his influential connections to secure support for the proposed colony of Georgia. In the royal charter of 9 June 1732 authorizing the founding of that colony he was named as the first president of the trustees [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95206', "Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America")</script>]. In the summer of the following year, partly because of his lobbying and partly because of his role in the Georgia project, he received another Irish honour when he was created earl of Egmont.<br>
<br>Between 1732 and the spring of 1742, when he resigned from the common council of the trustees because of his failing health, Egmont played a pivotal role in securing both the public and the private funding which were essential for the support and defence of Georgia. When the trustees' plan came under attack from the Georgia colonists and their allies in the House of Commons Egmont adroitly organized their defence. The survival of Georgia owed as much to Egmont's efforts in London as it did to Oglethorpe's activities in the colony. Egmont kept a personal diary for many years, and this, together with his accounts of the Georgia trustees' proceedings, provides a mine of information not only about his own life but also about many different facets of &eacute;lite society in early Georgian London. Egmont's diaries, and the unreliable <span class="italic">Genealogical History of the House of Yvery</span>, published under his supervision in 1742, lend credence to the contemporary view of him as a pompous and conceited person. However, his diaries also reveal that he had a deep and abiding love of the arts and enjoyed a generally happy relationship with his wife. Egmont died in London on 1 May 1748 and was buried at Erwarton. He was survived by his wife, who died on 22 August the following year and by his son, John Perceval (1711&#150;1770), who succeeded him as the second earl of Egmont. His name was often subsequently spelt Percival.<br>
