<span class="headword">Duncan,  William Henry</span>  (1805&#150;1863), <span class="occ">physician and medical officer of health</span>, was born in Liverpool on 27 January 1805, the third son and fifth of the seven children of George Duncan, merchant of Liverpool, and his wife, Christian, the youngest daughter of James Currie, minister of Middlebie and of Kirkpatrick Fleming, Dumfriesshire, and a sister of James Currie MD FRS of Liverpool. He was educated under the supervision of his uncle, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8217/', "Revd Henry Duncan DD")</script>, at Ruthwell manse, his tutors including Robert Mitchell. From 1825 to 1829 he studied at Edinburgh University. He graduated MD in 1829; the dedicatees of his thesis, &#145;De ventris in reliquum corpus potestate&#146; (&#145;On the influence of the abdomen over the body in general&#146;), included professors William P. Alison and James Home.<br>
<br>By 1830 Duncan was in medical practice in Liverpool, also serving as a physician at the Central and North dispensaries. His published analysis of the cholera cases he attended during the 1832 epidemic drew attention to the correlations between disease and environment (in particular the habitations, principally in cellars and courts, of the poor). In 1804 Currie had also written on the relationship between health and environment in Liverpool. Duncan submitted evidence to the inquiry into the corporation of Liverpool (1833), the commission on the condition of the poor in Ireland (1836 report), and the House of Commons' select committee on the health of towns (1840), detailing the deplorable &#145;sanitary state of the labouring classes&#146; in Liverpool, whose population was rapidly increasing, principally by migration from Ireland and elsewhere. His paper &#145;On the physical causes of the high rate of mortality in Liverpool&#146; (1843) was particularly influential; Liverpool he declared to be &#145;the most unhealthy town in England&#146;. He was a prominent member of the Liverpool branch of the Health of Towns Association, established in 1845.<br>
<br>It was largely due to Duncan's efforts that the corporation of Liverpool promoted the <span class="roman">Liverpool Sanitary Act</span> 1846, which established a public health service as an essential activity of local government. Under the act Duncan was appointed medical officer of health for the borough of Liverpool, from 1 January 1847. The first such appointment in England, initially part-time, the post became full-time in 1848 at an annual salary of &pound;750.<br>
<br>A most conscientious man, of generally a quiet and retiring disposition, Duncan, as a pioneer in sanitary reform, faced opposition but robustly defended his actions and publications against criticism. He enjoyed a good relationship with the corporation and particularly with its able engineer, James Newlands. However, he encountered difficulties with the select vestry (responsible for poor-law institutions), particularly during the years when epidemics of typhus (1847) and cholera (1849, 1854) ravaged the town. To his influence and actions may be attributed a significant reduction in the population living in cellars and other &#145;unhealthy dwellings&#146;, and a general improvement in environmental hygiene. He established methods of work, and initiated courses of improvement under which, by 1890, the average general death rate of Liverpool was declared by Sir John Simon to have been reduced by &#145;probably at least a fourth part&#146; of the rate which prevailed when Duncan had become medical officer of health.<br>
<br>Duncan was a physician at Liverpool's Northern Hospital from 1837 to 1838 and at Liverpool Infirmary from 1843 to 1848. He lectured at the Liverpool Royal Institution school of medicine and surgery (from 1844 the Liverpool Infirmary medical school) from 1835 to 1848, and was the school's secretary in 1844&#150;5. He helped to establish the Liverpool Medical Society (of which he was secretary from 1833 and president from 1836 to 1838) and also the Liverpool Medical Institution (in 1840 he became its first secretary). He was an active member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool from 1837 onwards and served as its treasurer.<br>
<br>Duncan was twice married: in 1848 to Philadelphia (<i>d</i>. 1850), eldest daughter of James Rickarby, merchant, of Liverpool; and secondly, in 1853, to Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of William Duncan MacAndrew, merchant, of Liverpool. He and his second wife had a son and a daughter. Duncan, whose health had been failing for several years, died in West Park, Elgin, on 23 May 1863.<br>
