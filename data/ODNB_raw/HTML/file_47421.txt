<span class="headword">Weyer,  Deryk Vander</span>  (1925&#150;1990), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 21 January 1925 at Bridlington, Yorkshire, the second child and only son of Clement Vander Weyer, insurance company manager, and his wife, Harriet. He was educated at Bridlington School and in 1941 joined Barclays Bank. He served in the Indian army during the Second World War, where he reached the rank of major. On his return to Barclays, a company hitherto influenced by members of the families who had combined to form it in 1896, he was able to take advantage of the company's training courses for people from its ordinary intake who showed ability and promise. He married Marguerite Warden in 1950&#151;they had a son, Martin, and a daughter, Linda&#151;and began his ascent of the ladder of promotion at Barclays. In 1956 he was made assistant manager in Liverpool, in 1960 manager of Barclays' Chester branch, and in 1965 a local director in Liverpool.<br>
<br>The opportunity to create a distinctive role for himself came in October 1967, when Barclays seconded Weyer for six months to the Oxford Centre for Management Studies (later renamed Templeton College). His dissertation on marketing in banking, written while there, caught the attention of Derek Wilde, Barclays' senior general manager, and John Thomson, its chairman. No British bank then had a marketing department, and touting for business was anathema. Wilde and Thomson brought Weyer to Barclays' London headquarters, authorized him to establish a marketing and planning department, and promoted him to assistant general manager. His requests for facts and figures led to the creation of management accounting within Barclays, and he became a general manager in 1969, with both marketing and planning responsibilities. He approved of Barclays' adoption of &#145;management by objectives&#146; techniques in its branches and welcomed the freer lending made possible by government acceptance of a 1971 Bank of England report on credit control.<br>
<br>Weyer wrote occasional articles for <span class="italic">The Banker</span>; they were lucid and forward-looking, and, while much that they contain could not be considered revolutionary, they were of great interest to people in other banks, who saw in them pointers to developments which became obvious only some eighteen months later. The articles enhanced his reputation as the thinking person's banker, and also the reputation of Barclays. Within the bank, the structure of a central bureau presiding over thirty local boards, peopled largely by those with family connections to the 1896 partnerships, seemed inappropriate to Weyer in the 1970s. As general manager of domestic banking in 1972, he orchestrated, with the support of Barclays' main board, a series of useful reforms of local boards. However, the boards were only finally abolished after he left office.<br>
<br>Tall, lean, brisk in thought and manner, Weyer was later described as &#145;an achiever and by his own admission always ambitious&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 June 1990). Much liked by the secretaries and chauffeurs who worked for him and appreciated his kindnesses, he was &#145;a quiet man with an impish humour but his authority was never in doubt&#146;  (ibid.). Inevitably the organizational changes he promoted, and his implicit criticism of those who resisted them, did not endear him to all. Nevertheless, his undoubted ability ensured his progression to senior general manager in 1973, board director in 1974, vice-chairman in 1977, and deputy group chairman in 1980. He was also chairman of Barclays' embryonic merchant bank and chairman of Barclays Bank UK from 1980 to 1983. The latter was intended as a logical counterbalance to Barclays Bank International, but in fact Barclays group board was in real control of Barclays' domestic banking. His task was to end Barclays Bank UK, consolidating authority within the group board (into which Barclays Bank International was also merged in 1985). He was only the third of Barclays' non-&#145;family&#146; general managers to sit on the group board, and the second to be an executive director. However, he was not considered for the chairmanship, a post intended for Sir Timothy Bevan (from one of the founding families) long before. In 1983 Weyer resigned executive positions within Barclays, though he remained a deputy chairman. He became executive deputy chairman of British Telecom (BT), nursing it through privatization and, contrary to his centralizing mission in Barclays, chafing against over-centralization.<br>
<br>As chairman of the chief executive committee of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers (1974&#150;6) Weyer helped rescue fringe banks in the 1973&#150;4 crisis. Valued by the Bank of England, he was made a director in 1986, and in 1987 a member of its new board of banking supervision. Ill health caused him to retire from BT in 1986, and from Barclays and the Bank of England in 1988. He served as a member of the royal commission on the distribution of income and wealth (1977&#150;9), president of the Institute of Bankers (1979&#150;81), and governor of the Museum of London (1978&#150;83), and was made a CBE in June 1986. A lover of music, he was also on the board of the English National Opera.<br>
<br>Weyer was proud of being a Yorkshireman and of his Flemish and Huguenot origins, and was a painter of local scenes in his spare time. He died at his home, Gatefield, High Road, Chipstead, near Coulsdon, Surrey, on 16 June 1990; he was survived by his wife, son, and daughter.<br>
