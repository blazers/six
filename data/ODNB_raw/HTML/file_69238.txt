<span class="headword">Starkey,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1690), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, the son of George Starkey of Isley Walton, Leicestershire, was apprenticed to the bookseller John Saywell on 9 November 1646 and freed on 6 November 1655. The first publications that can be ascribed to him were printed in 1657 and he appears to have rapidly established himself, working from a shop in Fleet Street. In 1660 Starkey published George Lawson's <span class="italic">Politica sacra</span>, a work which, among other influences, drew on Machiavelli's notions of the disadvantages of unmixed forms of government. This Machiavellianism, the most important strand running through Starkey's output, can be discerned in another publication in 1660, James Harrington's <span class="italic">The Rota</span>; but it also helps explain Starkey's publication of numerous books and pamphlets about law and European constitutions. He was thus responsible for works on the states of Venice, other Italian principalities, and the United Provinces. Starkey developed a particularly strong interest in the history of the Turks, perhaps as a sustained parallel with the perceived arbitrary government of Charles II, and in 1668 published Paul Rycaut's history of the Ottoman empire. Concern with European statecraft evidently provoked or reflected expertise in publishing translations of prominent European writers. All these interests were reconciled in Starkey's most important publication, in 1675, of the first printed translation of Machiavelli's <span class="italic">Works</span>. Starkey may have made the translation himself, since the 1689 edition refers to the &#145;publisher or translator&#146;. He certainly wrote a preface in which he praised both Cosimo de' Medici, whom he had met and supplied with books, and Machiavelli for his &#145;principles of religion&#146;, which were sharply critical of the &#145;priestcraft&#146; that Starkey saw in the Restoration Anglican clergy. Starkey ended by exhorting his readers to absorb Machiavelli's message and to &#145;serve God, thy King and thy country with the knowledge he will teach thee&#146;. Though Starkey himself may have had a hand in editing the <span class="italic">Works</span> the honour has usually been given to Henry Neville. It was Starkey who published Neville's <span class="italic">Plato redivivus</span> in 1681, an ascription which can be determined from the list of works recommended to the reader at the start of the treatise, all of which were published by Starkey. <span class="italic">Plato redivivus</span> was the most subtle of the political theories spawned by the succession crisis of 1679&#150;81, a careful reconciliation of republican ideals to monarchical government.<br>
<br>By 1681 Starkey was already a marked man. He had come into conflict in the late 1660s with Robert Clavell over the rights to a catalogue of books called <span class="italic">Mercurius librarius</span>, the forerunner of the term catalogues. In 1671 he published Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span> and the politically charged <span class="italic">Samson Agonistes</span>. But it was increasingly in the political sphere that he created disquiet. His bookshop had evidently become a focal point for news-gathering by 1675, a political watershed and the publication year of Machiavelli's <span class="italic">Works</span>, for the earl of Danby noted that Starkey received daily reports of &#145;all resolutions of Parliament that are either voted or are preparing for vote in either House, perfect true or artificially corrupted or penned by halves on purpose as may make most for the Faction&#146;. Danby observed that &#145;ill affected citizens of all sorts&#146; flocked to the shop  (Browning, 3.2&#150;3). Fortunately a series of newsletters written by Starkey survives in the British Library for the period 1667&#150;72 and confirms the extraordinarily detailed accounts of parliamentary affairs that he was able to compile. Since Starkey was close to Anchitell Grey, an MP whose notes on debates were later published and who is mentioned by name in the newsletters, it seems likely that Grey was supplying the information to Starkey or that Starkey's sources were used by Grey to reconstruct debates. He is thus probably the &#145;Mr Starky&#146; who was taken into custody, apparently for selling &#145;certain votes of the last sessions of Parliament without licence or authority&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1673&#150;5</i>, 46). It also seems probable that the evolution of the Green Ribbon Club owed much to him, and that the gatherings of the &#145;ill affected&#146; at his shop paved the way for more formal meetings there which we know took place by 1679  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 21). Starkey's activities during the crisis of 1679&#150;81 are on occasion hard to disentangle from those of Henry Starkey, a servant of the earl of Shaftesbury and Samuel Starkey, his nephew who was clerk to the radical lawyer Aaron Smith  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 41). Nevertheless it is clear from his publications that he was vehemently anti-Catholic and that he considered the market ripe for another edition of Machiavelli. In 1682 he was elected as a common councillor for Farringdon Without, earning for his efforts the description of &#145;as bad as may be&#146; from one commentator  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/418/145). Perhaps assuming that office gave him some protection from prosecution, Starkey revived a long-cherished project. In 1677 he had been arrested for publishing John Selden's <span class="italic">Historical Discourse</span> (edited by Nathaniel Bacon), &#145;the contents whereof are of a very seditious nature&#146; according to the warrant  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1677&#150;8</i>, 402). Four to five hundred copies had been seized and burnt &#145;to ashes&#146;  (ibid., 495). Yet Starkey's attempt to publish the work again in 1682 provoked a similar response. The government described it as &#145;dedicated to the service of a rebellion&#146; and extracted passages to prove its anti-monarchical intent  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 608). Starkey was indicted in December and he later recorded that<blockquote>the prosecution went on so rigorously that the Publisher, tho beyond the seas, yet willing to try the Cause, appeared according to the constant practice of the Court of King's Bench, by his Attorney, but for not being personally present in the Court (which was then impossible) he was by the Arbitrary Power of the then Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys Out-Law'd for a Misdemeanour. (advertisement in 1689 edition)</blockquote>Starkey has been linked to the Rye House plot of 1683, though there is little evidence to substantiate this, and his subsequent flight to Holland seems to have been largely to avoid arrest rather than because of his culpability.<br>
<br>Evidently concerned for his safety, Starkey became a citizen of Amsterdam through the solicitation of Abraham Keck, at whose house the earl of Shaftesbury had recently died. In spring 1685 Starkey moved to Utrecht, where he mixed with the radical exile community, and a government spy described him as &#145;a greate rogue&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 41812, fol. 58). But he returned in the summer to Amsterdam, where his name was linked in reports with that of John Locke. Starkey was once more the focal point of a radical club where he was reported to have said &#145;that the ruin of the protestants was most assuredly designed throughout Christendom&#146; by means of an Anglo-French treaty  (BL, Add. MS 41818, fol. 99). By the end of the year he managed the affairs of the exiled Thomas Papillon.<br>
<br>In 1688 Starkey assisted the Dutch invasion plans by publishing Williamite propaganda, such as <span class="italic">Fagel's Letter</span>, copies of which he shipped to England. He worked in partnership with Locke's friend and publisher Awnsham Churchill and William Churchill; like the former, he lent money to the new king in January 1689. He also saw an opportunity to print or reprint works of political theory that would support the revolution, such as works by Gilbert Burnet and a new edition of Lawson's <span class="italic">Politica</span>, which now carried a marginal gloss (presumably inserted by Starkey himself) which asserted the right of subjects to defend their rights. He was finally free to publish Bacon/Selden's <span class="italic">Historical and Political Discourse of the Laws</span>. In an advertisement he explained that the earlier edition had been preserved &#145;with care and charge &hellip; for the benefit of all that are willing to know and maintain their Ancient Laws and Birth-Rights&#146;. In February 1690 he was elected an assistant to the Stationers' Company but refused to take his place when he was denied the seniority to which he believed himself entitled.<br>
<br>Starkey died soon afterwards, just when the political climate was turning in his direction. In October 1689 he had drawn up his will and left an &#145;account&#146; of his estate which totalled &pound;4250, of which his wife was to have &pound;1500, his four daughters a further &pound;2000 between them, and his son John a mere &pound;200. John Dunton remembered him as a man who &#145;would talk well upon any subject and had good nature in his very looks &hellip; He was a brave asserter of English Liberties to his last breath&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Errors</span>, 213).<br>
