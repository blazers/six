<span class="headword">Wyld,  Henry Cecil Kennedy</span>  (1870&#150;1945), <span class="occ">philologist and lexicographer</span>, was born in London on 27 March 1870, the only son of Henry Wyld, a commander in the service of the East India Company, and his wife, Louise, daughter of Benjamin Kennedy, a Scottish gentleman living in the county of Fife. His paternal grandfather, James Wyld, was a Fife landowner.<br>
<br>After a year at Charterhouse School, Wyld was educated privately at Lausanne (1885&#150;8) and then at the universities of Bonn and Heidelberg, and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1890 he married Grace Muriel (<i>d</i>. 1954), daughter of John Proctor, an Irish landowner of Ballina, co. Mayo. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Wyld studied philology, phonetics, and linguistics at Oxford with Henry Sweet and took his BLitt degree in 1899. On Sweet's recommendation he was in the same year appointed independent lecturer in the English language at University College, Liverpool. In 1904 the newly chartered University of Liverpool elected him its first Baines professor of English language and philology. From 1902 to 1910 he also acted as special inspector in the teaching of phonetics in the training colleges of Scotland, for which he wrote <span class="italic">The Growth of English</span> (1907). He remained at Liverpool until 1920, active in university administration, and by his teaching, lecturing, and writing became one of the foremost philologists of his generation. Most of his books and articles were written during this period, including his excellent <span class="italic">Historical Study of the Mother Tongue, an Introduction to Philological Method</span> (1906) and <span class="italic">A Short History of English</span> (1914) which, reissued in a third edition in 1927, enlarged considerably and revised mainly in the light of the researches of himself and his pupils, long retained its value. In <span class="italic">A History of Modern Colloquial English</span> (1920; 3rd edn, with six short appendixes, 1936) he developed with obvious personal satisfaction, as well as with remarkable success, the technique, first evolved by his friend Robert Eugen Zachrisson of the University of Uppsala, Sweden, for investigating the chronological problems of the New English period. The book concentrated on phonology, leaving syntax and vocabulary, as he said, to other, later authors  (preface, v).<br>
<br>In 1920 Wyld was elected Merton professor of English language and literature in the University of Oxford, and he held his professorial fellowship at Merton College for the rest of his life. Here he completed his short <span class="italic">Studies in English Rhymes</span> (1923), another pioneering book designed mainly for students of literature. In 1932 appeared his excellent one-volume <span class="italic">Universal Dictionary of the English Language</span>, a dictionary of contemporary usage, both literary and colloquial, which, though it imposed a &#145;long and laborious&#146; task and sometimes tried his patience, stirred many of his contemporaries to think of him as a <i>Johnsonius redivivus</i>. Its size and comprehensiveness, its methodical arrangement, its unusually full treatment of etymologies, its clear and precise definitions, together with its brief and racy illustrative sentences mostly of his own coining, gave it a lasting value.<br>
<br>Wyld greatly enjoyed his lecturing at Oxford, and his pupils invariably found his exposition clear and intensely invigorating. Despite bad eyesight he continued his philological researches and added to the number of his learned articles. According to the <span class="italic">Oxford Companion to the English Language</span> his <span class="italic">Universal Dictionary</span> &#145;set a pattern followed by A. S. Hornby in the Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English&#146;  (Christophersen, 1135) in its use of phonetic transcriptions, detailed etymologies and illustrations of modern idiomatic use.<br>
<br>In 1932 Wyld was awarded the British Academy's Sir Israel Gollancz biennial prize for his contributions to the study of English philology, and the University of Uppsala conferred upon him the honorary degree of PhD. He was also an honorary member of the Modern Language Association and of the Linguistic Society of America.<br>
<br>Wyld was a tallish, well-built, broad-shouldered man, and in his youth was fond of outdoor pursuits, especially riding and hunting. In later years he was an enthusiastic gardener. His pleasant reverberating voice enhanced his excellent pronunciation of English. His ear was acute: one obituarist reported that &#145;he had an uncanny way of overhearing what others were saying at a distance, and he detected differences in pronunciation which could not be noted by every listener even after he had pointed them out&#146;  (D. N. S.). His easy flow of resounding words, his ready wit, his extensive knowledge of people, affairs, languages, and literatures, and, not least, his forceful personality made him a lively conversationalist and friend. His Johnsonian literary style reflected the man. He died at his home, Alvescot House, Alvescot, Oxfordshire, on 26 January 1945.<br>
