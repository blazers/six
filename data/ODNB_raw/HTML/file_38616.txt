<span class="headword">Gomme <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Merck]</span>,  Alice Bertha</span>, Lady Gomme  (1853&#150;1938), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born on 4 January 1853 at 5 South Molton Street, in the registration district of St George, Hanover Square, London, the daughter of Charles Antony Thomas Merck, a master tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tilley. Save for a sister we know nothing of her life until, on 31 March 1875 at twenty-two, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38353/', "(George) Laurence Gomme (1853&#150;1916)")</script>, then a young administrator in the Metropolitan Board of Works.<br>
<br>Although seen as an enthusiastic and prolific writer on folklore, Alice Gomme's reputation was until recent times not fully recognized. For example, her approach to and the reliability of her sources tended to be regarded as suspect  (Opie and Opie, vi) and&#151;as often at that time&#151;she was seen as playing a subordinate role to that of her better-known husband (who was knighted in 1911), with whom she often worked in partnership  (Dorson, <span class="italic">British Folklorists</span>, 279).<br>
<br>Recent commentators, however (Simpson and Roud, and Boyes), provide convincing evidence for Alice Gomme's scholarship. Her most notable work is <span class="italic">The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland</span> (2 vols., 1894 and 1898, reprinted 1964 and in 1984 with an introduction by Damian Webb), which includes tunes, singing rhymes, and methods of playing. The work contains descriptions of some 800 children's games current in the second half of the nineteenth century, with comparisons of variants, collected by seventy-six correspondents from 112 locations. She herself was an active collector of games and &#145;was the first scholar to define children's games as a separate genre of folklore&#146;. The book &#145;discusses &hellip; texts, history, cultural significance and formal structures [of games] &hellip; and develops a comprehensive system for their classification&#146;  (Boyes, <span class="italic">Musical Traditions</span>, 1). It was an impressive work to publish, especially at a time when she was a busy mother (she gave birth to seven sons between 1876 and 1891) and active in folklore fields generally.<br>
<br>In 1878 at twenty-five Gomme became a founder member of the Folklore Society and for sixty years was active in its affairs; she was on its council from 1912 until her death. From at least 1883 she regularly contributed to <span class="italic">Folklore</span> and other journals and newspapers, writing on diverse matters: &#145;Conception by means of a glance&#146;, &#145;A Berwickshire kirn dolly&#146;, &#145;Boer folk medicine and some parallels&#146;, and &#145;The character of Beelzebub&#146; (<span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 1890, 1901, 1902, and 1929).<br>
<br>In 1894 Gomme published <span class="italic">Children's Singing Games</span>. Work on this had brought her into contact with Cecil Sharp, and the two developed a close working relationship which led to an expanded work under the same title in five volumes published between 1909 and 1912. For legal reasons, however, it appeared under Sharp's name only; they remained good friends until Sharp's death in 1924  (Boyes, <span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 204). She was active in the Folk-Song Society and was a founder member of the English Folk Dance Society.<br>
<br>Gomme's interest in folk cookery and in children's games came together at the conversazione, held in October 1891, which was intended as a diversion from the serious business of the first International Folklore Congress then taking place in London. She was secretary of the conversazione organizing committee and, though pregnant, &#145;devised, researched and organised&#146; the occasion. The programme, far from being a diversion, was the first comprehensive display of folklore in Britain. It &#145;involved a substantial exhibition, showing the history of scholarship in folklore &hellip; portraits of scholars, illustrations and examples of material culture ranging from items of regional cookery to funeral garlands&#146;  (Boyes, <span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 205). There were recitations of folk-tales, a performance of a traditional folk play, and a programme of traditional songs and dances still in use, performed by pupils from Barnes School &#145;under the supervision of Mrs. Gomme&#146;  (conversazione programme). The refreshments were examples of folk cookery. Forty years later, when Florence White founded the English Folk Cookery Association, Gomme's pioneering efforts in this field were recognized in her election as its first president  (<span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, 4 March 1931).<br>
<br>Gomme, who was an active suffragist, revealed in her work an interest in the position of women in society. She early recognized the value of playing games in childhood and taught games to schoolchildren  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 10 Jan 1903). Ever busy as lecturer as well as writer, she was for some time president of the London Shakespeare League, and was an enthusiast for Elizabethan stage methods of production. She was a friend and supporter of Lilian Baylis. Two of her sons were killed in the First World War, one of whom, Austin, was a promising architect highly regarded by his master, C. R. Ashbee. Her third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54473/', "Arthur Allan Gomme")</script>, was librarian to the Patent Office and himself president of the Folklore Society (1951&#150;3) and her fifth, Arnold Wycombe Gomme (1886&#150;1959), was a noted classicist. Photographs show her as of medium height and slender build, her hair tied in a bun. She appears conventionally dressed, and one of her grandsons remembers her in her eighties as a grand figure. After her husband's early death in 1916 she lived in a hotel at 21&#150;2 Montague Street, Bloomsbury, London, and also at the family home in Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire. She died on 5 January 1938, at 11 Porchester Terrace, Paddington, London, of pneumonia and heart failure and on 8 January was cremated, as her husband had been, at Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex.<br>
