<span class="headword">Lindsay,  David</span>  (1531&#150;1613), <span class="occ">bishop of Ross</span>, belonged to the family of Lindsay of Edzell and was a nephew of David Lindsay, ninth earl of Crawford. His pedigree is not well authenticated and he has been identified as son variously of Robert Lindsay of Kirkton and of Alexander Lindsay of Haltoun and Rachael Barclay of Mathers. He is said to have been a student at St Andrews University, though his name does not appear in the matriculation and graduation lists, and to have travelled in France and Switzerland. Certainly the name David Lindsay occurs at Geneva associated with the congregation to which John Knox ministered. Lindsay became minister in Leith by 1560, a strategic town as the port of Edinburgh where reforming opinions had spread in the decades before the Reformation. His services were sought by the general assembly, which frequently appointed him its commissioner and temporary visitor to oversee such areas as Kyle, Carrick and Cunningham, Moray, Lothian, Galloway, Teviotdale, Tweeddale, Angus (Forfarshire), and Clydesdale.<br>
<br>Nominated by the assembly in 1562 to preach in churches lacking ministers in the Merse (Berwickshire), Lindsay rose to prominence in the work of the assembly's committees and in discussions with government. On six occasions he was elected moderator of the general assembly: February 1569, October 1577, October 1582, May 1586 (when the king, voting first, chose him), April 1593, and March 1597. Earlier, he had been appointed to the convention of Leith in 1572 which secured a compromise between church and crown on the thorny subject of ecclesiastical endowment leading to the introduction of protestant bishops. When John Knox refused to inaugurate John Douglas as archbishop of St Andrews, Lindsay was one of three ministers who laid hands on the new archbishop and embraced him as a sign of his admission. He visited Knox on his deathbed in November 1572 and at Knox's request, though he &#145;thought the message hard&#146;, went to Edinburgh Castle to warn William Kirkcaldy of Grange that unless he surrendered the castle, which he held for Mary, he would &#145;be brought down over the walls of it with shame and hang against the sun&#146; (Calderwood, 3.234; <span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 6.657). Lindsay visited Kirkcaldy after his condemnation and was sent by him to the Regent Morton to intercede for his life, being empowered to offer Kirkcaldy's whole estate as a ransom. But his intercession failed and Lindsay, at Kirkcaldy's request, attended his execution in 1573.<br>
<br>Lindsay participated in the preparation of the <span class="italic">Second Book of Discipline</span>, completed in 1578 with its endorsement of a presbyterian constitution for the church, and in 1580 helped prepare a plan for establishing presbyteries. Yet Lindsay himself was ever inclined to moderation. He was apt to be dubbed a &#145;court minister&#146;, though as late as 1592 he reiterated the opinion he held with other ministers that King James was not exempt from the censure of excommunication if he disobeyed God's will. That &#145;not a little offended&#146; the king  (Calderwood, 5.162). Even when elevated to the episcopate, he spoke out in the privy council against the king's treatment of the presbyterian ministers banished for defying the king's wishes in 1605 by holding a general assembly at Aberdeen&#151;a punishment which he considered harsher than that accorded to Jesuits or murderers. Much earlier, in 1579, he was selected to instruct King James's French cousin, Esm&eacute; Stewart, who professed a willingness to convert to protestantism but whose arrival at court had aroused fears that he was the agent of a Catholic plot. Distrustful of Esm&eacute;'s influence, he welcomed the Ruthven lords' palace revolution in 1582. At the same time, he sought to reduce antagonisms among political factions: not only had he tried to mediate between the Regent Morton and earls of Atholl and Argyll who had dislodged him from power in 1578, but in 1583 he sought to enlist the support of the English ambassador as mediator between the ultra-protestant Ruthven lords, who fled to England, and the earl of Arran, who headed a conservative, anti-presbyterian administration. When he attempted to delay the application of the reactionary &#145;Black acts&#146; passed by parliament in 1584, he found himself imprisoned in Blackness Castle for forty-seven weeks.<br>
<br>Lindsay's moderate counsels gradually gained the king's support. He stood out as the only minister&#151;with the exception of the king's own minister&#151;who was willing to comply with James's request that ministers pray for his mother before her execution in 1587. He accompanied James as chaplain in October 1589 when the king set sail for Norway to bring home his bride, Anne of Denmark, and married James and Anne at Oslo on 23 November, conducting the ceremony in French. Thereafter, on their return to Edinburgh, he officiated at the queen's coronation at Holyrood in May. He was present, too, at the baptisms of Prince Henry in the Chapel Royal at Stirling in August 1594, when he delivered an address in French, of Princess Margaret in April 1599, and of Prince Charles in November 1600. He went to Edinburgh from Falkland Palace in an effort to persuade ministers of the veracity of the king's version of the Gowrie conspiracy in August 1600, and when they declined to approve a general service of thanksgiving for the king's safety, he conducted a service at the market cross, and preached a sermon in his own church in the king's presence. As James began the task in 1597 of reviving episcopacy by approving &#145;parliamentary bishops&#146; who would sit and vote as bishops in parliament but were not then accorded any special jurisdiction within the church, Lindsay was one of the first three ministers selected for appointment. He became titular bishop of Ross in November 1600 when almost seventy years old and by 1609 was accounted infirm through age. After episcopal succession was restored in 1610 when three Scottish bishops were consecrated in England, Lindsay duly received consecration in Scotland on 24 February 1611.<br>
<br>Although Lindsay survived until his eighty-third year, when he died at Leith on 14 August 1613, there is little sign of his activity in his northern diocese. For the most part his continuing work as parish minister in Leith, his attendance at parliament and general assembly, and his seat on the privy council kept him outside his diocese. His son-in-law, Archbishop John Spottiswoode, depicted him as a man &#145;of a peaceable nature, and greatly favoured of the king, to whom he performed divers good services, especially in the troubles he had with the Church: a man universally beloved and well-esteemed of by all wise men&#146;. He was buried in Leith (at South Leith parish church) &#145;by his own direction, as desiring to rest with the people on whom he had taken great pains in his life&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Church</span>, 3.220). His first wife was Janet or Jonet Ramsay, daughter of George Ramsay of Clattie; his second, Helen Harrison. His elder son became Sir Jerome Lindsay of Annatland, Lyon king of arms; his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16697/', "David Lindsay")</script>, served as rector of St Olave's, Southwark, and then succeeded his father in the ministry at South Leith; his daughter, Rachel, married Archbishop Spottiswoode.<br>
