<span class="headword">Frances,  Juanita</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Juanita Frances Lemont; <em>married name </em>Juanita Frances Schlesinger]</span>  (1901&#150;1992), <span class="occ">feminist activist and organizer</span>, was born on 5 October 1901 in Adelaide, Australia. Her mother, whose name was Lemont, was a shop assistant; her father, who was in the navy, was unknown to her, but is described on her marriage certificate as Timothy Lemont, master mariner. Her early education and professional training as a nurse took place in Adelaide. However, by the late 1920s she had moved to London, where she worked first as a nurse and then embarked on a brief stage career as a dancer and a conjuror's assistant.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1934 Juanita Lemont married Gerald Leonard Schlesinger (1889&#150;1965), a divorced banker, with whom she had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947, whereupon she took the name Juanita Frances (although she was known in some circles as Frances). As a young married woman living in west London, she became involved in charitable work with women in North Kensington. A meeting with Flora Drummond, veteran feminist and chair of the Women's Guild of Empire, launched her on what was to become a lifelong career of feminist activism in pursuit of married women's rights. While working for the guild in North Kensington she soon became acquainted with the small circle of feminists campaigning in London at the time. Her organizational potential was spotted by Dorothy Evans, secretary of the Six Point Group, who asked her to join a new committee on the housewife. In 1938, with Frances as its chair, the committee broke away from the Six Point Group to become the Married Women's Association (MWA). Although concerned to retain links with old feminism, Frances was keen to develop a new feminist organization which would bring to the foreground issues relevant to the lives of young married women and mothers. Hence her early decision to drop the term &#145;feminist&#146; from the MWA's literature was an attempt to attract the support of young women, many of whom had not previously been politically active.<br>
<br>As chair of the MWA, Juanita Frances steered the association through the first ten years of its life, playing a prominent role in its development and, at the same time, making a major contribution to the shape of post-war &#145;new&#146; feminism. So called because of its emphasis on equality in difference, &#145;new&#146; feminism focused in particular on the legal and economic rights of the married woman and housewife. Under Juanita Frances's leadership and in close association with the Labour MP Edith Summerskill, the MWA demanded recognition of the housewife as an equal worker and marital partner entitled to half the male wage and property of a marriage.<br>
<br>In the late 1940s and 1950s, a period when women were widely thought to have achieved equality, and feminism was often viewed as redundant, Juanita Frances struggled, often against the wishes of branch members, to ensure that the association remained committed to her feminist vision of legal and economic equality for women on the home front. As editor of the MWA's monthly journal, <span class="italic">Wife and Citizen</span>, she sought to maintain what was in the late 1940s and 1950s one of the only published forums for feminist debate.<br>
<br>Although she was committed to cross-party women's politics, Juanita Frances's own sympathies lay with the Labour Party, particularly in the immediate post-war years. By the 1950s and 1960s, her political interests and energies were committed to working at a national rather than at a local branch level. With the aim of turning the MWA into a pressure group for married and divorced women's rights, she worked hard during this period to generate support from a range of high-profile figures. Her ability to court and attract attention to the MWA was a key factor in the association's emergence as a leading women's pressure group in the 1960s.<br>
<br>During the 1960s piecemeal legal reforms such as the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span> (1964) and the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Homes Act</span> (1967) began to address MWA concerns. Acknowledging that &#145;the door to the economic rights of a wife during marriage has been opened&#146;, the MWA retained its commitment, as it does to this day, to joint ownership of all marital income and property  (Blackford, &#145;Ideas and structures of feminism&#146;, 222).<br>
<br>Although towards the end of her life failing health prevented her from playing a major role in the MWA, Juanita Frances remained committed to the association, a familiar figure at its lunch parties in the houses of parliament. She died of heart failure on 25 November 1992, in the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, and was cremated at Golders Green on 3 December.<br>
