<span class="headword">Vincent,  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1600?), <span class="occ">author</span>, may have been the Philip Vincent baptized on 23 November 1600 at Frisby in the parish of Conisbrough, Yorkshire, the second son of Richard Vincent (<i>d</i>. 1617), a lawyer, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Rokeby of Hotham in the same county. This would make him the grandson of Richard Vincent, army officer and younger son of the family of Vincent of Braywell, Yorkshire. This Philip Vincent was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and in 1625 was presented by Sir Francis Vincent to the rectory of Stoke D'Abernon in Surrey, which he resigned on 17 August 1629. At the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great, London, on 17 March 1625 he married Frances, daughter of Sir Christopher Hedon of Baconthorpe, Norfolk, and widow of Henry Draper of Bromley, Kent. They had three sons before her death on 30 November 1630.<br>
<br>Vincent produced two known works, which appear to have come from his travels. The first, <span class="italic">The lamentations of Germany, wherein, as in a glasse, we may behold her miserable condition, composed by Dr Vincent, Theo.</span>, was signed P. Vencent, and appeared in London in 1638. The account describes his travels in Germany from 1633 to 1635, during which he was besieged in Heidelberg by the Spaniards. His accounts describe the horrors of the scene in great detail, graphically depicting the hardships of the inhabitants and the abuses of the soldiers.<br>
<br>Vincent's second work, <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Late Battell Fought in New England and the Salvages</span>, also first appeared in London in 1638, and was signed P. Vincentius. The author states he had previously visited Guiana and describes the New England scene with such detail that he received his information either at first hand or from a reliable second-hand source. The account describes the 1637 war between the New England colonists and the Pequot Indians, whom Vincent describes as &#145;a stately warlike people, which have been terrible to their neighbours, and troublesome to the English&#146;. Manipulated by the Pequot's Amerindian rivals, Connecticut sent an ultimatum demanding that the Pequot become a tributary. Not surprisingly, the powerful Pequot refused and braced for war. Vincent's account describes the destruction of the second largest Pequot village in May 1637. The Connecticut-led force of some ninety colonists, seventy Amerindians under the command of the Mohegan leader Uncas and 500 Narragansett warriors caught the village by surprise. Defended fiercely by 150 warriors, the colonists and their Amerindian allies feared that the delay in taking the village would allow the main Pequot force to engage them. The Connecticut commander, John Mason, ordered that the village be burned and the survivors killed. Despite his vivid detail of the action and estimate of &#145;not less that 700 slaine or taken prisoners&#146;, Vincent did not hesitate to endorse the slaughter, remarking that &#145;sever justice must now then take place&#146;. The colonists lost only sixteen men. When the main Pequot force arrived, they were demoralized by the scene, and surrendered in large numbers. The destruction of the Pequot marked the rise of Connecticut and the changing face of colonial&#150;Amerindian warfare to conflicts of total destruction and extermination. Nothing more is known of Vincent.<br>
