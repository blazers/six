<span class="headword">Cubitt,  James</span>  (1836&#150;1912), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Ilford, Essex, on 20 March 1836, the only son and elder surviving child of James Cubitt (1808&#150;1863), Baptist minister, and his wife, Mary (1796/7&#150;1872). These Cubitts were Norfolk Baptists. James's grandfather William (1754&#150;1814) founded Neatishead Baptist church; a great-aunt, Sophia (1778&#150;1855), dominated Ingham Baptist church; an uncle, William (1801&#150;1888), became a Baptist manufacturer in Shoreditch and in Banbury. The Baptist ministry followed naturally for James's father, a conscientious man with a didactic streak and uncertain health: he attended Stepney College, then served pastorates at Ilford, Stratford upon Avon, Bourton on the Water, and Thrapston. At Ilford he married a widow and took pupils, among them a nephew, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1825&#150;1914), the mycologist. No record survives of the younger James's schooling but the wide reading, keen historical sense, and fluent, sharp English of his prime reflect this background of literate, articulate, and often quarrelsome provincial congregations on the cusp of prosperity.<br>
<br>It is not clear what turned Cubitt to architecture. The surname helped, but though the contracting&#151;like the engineering&#151;Cubitts came from Norfolk, and there was a marriage connection with the engineer Sir William Cubitt (1785&#150;1861), there was no real link with them. None the less it did no harm to be thought their kinsman, and <span class="italic">Building News</span> promoted the myth by calling Cubitt &#145;a member of the family of that name, which furnished a former President and a vice-president to the Institution of Civil Engineers&#146;  (16 May 1890).<br>
<br>From 1851 to 1856 Cubitt was articled to Isaac Gilbert of Nottingham and attended classes at the Nottingham School of Art. Assistantships followed, in Malvern with E. W. Elmslie (1856&#150;7) and in London with R. J. Withers and W. W. Pocock (1857&#150;60). Each had a sound line in public, commercial, and ecclesiastical buildings. Gilbert was a Congregationalist, Pocock a Wesleyan, Withers a churchman&#151;an ecclesiologist noted for plain, correct Gothic. They explain Cubitt's subsequent bias, confirmed by visits to Cotswold, midland, and north-eastern churches.<br>
<br>In 1862 Cubitt was in Camberwell. In the previous year his father had been appointed tutor at the Pastors' College, founded by the Baptist preaching phenomenon C. H. Spurgeon, in the Metropolitan Tabernacle, recently designed by Pocock. Cubitt's early practice was dominated by commissions associated with Spurgeon: chapels at East Hill, Wandsworth (1862), and Rye Hill, Newcastle upon Tyne (1864), and institutional buildings for the Tabernacle itself (1866&#150;9). The chapels were bold Italianate Romanesque; the rest was Ruskinian&#150;Venetian Gothic.<br>
<br>Other influences now worked on Cubitt. He relished the broad severity of J. L. Pearson, James Brooks, and G. F. Bodley, writing about such work and more technical matters in <span class="italic">Building News</span>. By 1868 he had moved to 26 Finsbury Place, in partnership with Henry Fuller, another of Isaac Gilbert's pupils. Fuller, who had worked for Alfred Waterhouse, had a growing chapel practice and a reputation for technical innovation. Cubitt completed Fuller's finest building, Clapton Park Congregational Church, Hackney (1869&#150;73).<br>
<br>In 1870 Cubitt published <span class="italic">Church Design for Congregations</span>, a persuasive manual for prospective chapel builders, advocating a truly protestant architecture for &#145;a real nineteenth-century church, in a masculine and monumental style&#146;. Convinced that the contemporary spirit was best found in the thirteenth century, he celebrated the &#145;magnificent capabilities&#146; of column-free naves, central crossings, and galleries &#145;where the architecture meant them to be&#146;. His sources ranged from Pugin to Viollet-le-Duc, his illustrations from Spain to Byzantium.<br>
<br>Fuller died in December 1872. By 1875 Cubitt had moved his practice to 2 Finsbury Pavement, his home to 5 Eaton Villas, Loughton, Essex, and had married Fanny Emma Comely (1851&#150;1875), a farmer's daughter whose family were mainstays of the elder Cubitt's ministry at Bourton. She died in childbirth four days before the stone-laying of the chapel that her husband designed for his father's old congregation. He never remarried.<br>
<br>The 1870s saw two landmarks in Cubitt's church design. Emmanuel Congregational Church, Cambridge (1874; Early English with Early French detail), celebrated nonconformity's new place in that university. Its nave arches of &#145;unusual span&#146; gave hearers full view of its pulpit. Union Chapel, Islington (1876&#150;89), won by Cubitt using the Ruskinian pseudonym Torcello in an ill-tempered competition adjudicated by Alfred Waterhouse, was a brick chorale of a church, fine for sung and spoken word, seating 1800, costing &pound;50,000, and hailed as among the most notable buildings erected in Britain between 1842 and 1892  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 1 Jan 1943).<br>
<br>Union Chapel was Cubitt's masterpiece, but the Baptist Church of the Redeemer, Edgbaston (1882), and the Welsh Church, Charing Cross Road, London (1887), were equally massive vindications of <span class="italic">Church Design</span>. Thereafter Cubitt mellowed. From 1881 he practised from 2 Broad Street Buildings, Liverpool Street, associated in the 1880s with J. M. Brydon, with G. F. Collinson in the 1890s, and with H. J. Manchip from 1905. In 1890 Cubitt was elected FRIBA, with Waterhouse and Brydon as proposers. The crisply helpful <span class="italic">Popular Handbook of Nonconformist Church Building</span> followed in 1892.<br>
<br>France now gave way to the Low Countries, and central crossings to broad naves. Osborne Road Baptist Church, Jesmond, Newcastle (1887), was emphatically Norman, but Avenue Congregational Church, Southampton (1898), and Streatham Congregational Church (1901) were parish churches in fifteenth-century Perpendicular Gothic. Most suggestive of all was Cubitt's fascination with Wren, who &#145;designed from the inside outwards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, 46, July 1884).<br>
<br>This announced a proto-member of the arts and crafts movement, as suggested in Cubitt's ancillary buildings for Westgate Road Baptist Church, Newcastle (1886), flagged in his secular commissions&#151;board schools, for example, in Loughton, Leytonstone, Lewisham, and Dulwich&#151;and fulfilled in the schoolroom (&#145;seventeenth-century domestic work&#146;) for Union Chapel, Loughton (1898), and in some private houses in Loughton. His last major building was a church, Tabernacl, Bangor (1905), at once Norman and Perpendicular&#151;proof of a Victorian mind pressing forward.<br>
<br>Cubitt was an architect's architect&#151;admired by Waterhouse and Brydon, singled out by Hermann Muthesius&#151;linking the ecclesiologists to the nonconformist conscience. He lived modestly in Loughton, Essex, where his brother-in-law William Vivian ministered until financial disgrace and death terminated his ministry. He died, intestate, on 8 August 1912 at his home, Monghyr Cottage, Loughton (which had been named after an Indian Baptist missionary station), and was buried two days later at Loughton cemetery.<br>
