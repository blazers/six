<span class="headword">Davis,  Morris Harold</span>  (1894&#150;1985), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born on 7 November 1894 at 47 Langdale Street, in the heart of the Jewish East End of London, the son of Joseph Davis (1868&#150;1940) and his wife, Bertha (<i>d</i>. 1954). His father, variously described as a boot maker and a licensee of public houses, hailed from Minsk; his mother was also of eastern European origin. Having married abroad, they appear to have settled in London at the end of the 1880s. Educated at various London county council schools, Davis was apprenticed within the ladies' tailoring trade, but later assisted his father in the running of a public house, and later still ceased regular employment, living, it would seem, off his own wealth and that of his parents.<br>
<br>Davis grew up in a staunchly Orthodox Jewish household, and followed his father in interesting himself in the governance of a variety of Jewish communal bodies in east London. He was also, like many members of the Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrant community, a passionate Zionist and a man of very left-wing views. In 1887 the banker Samuel Montagu, first Baron Swaythling, had induced the numerous small &#145;conventicles&#146; which Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants had established in the East End to form themselves into the Federation of Synagogues, which rapidly became the largest Jewish communal body in the United Kingdom. On Montagu's death in 1911 the leadership of the federation had passed to his son, the second baron, Louis Montagu, who in common with many members of the Anglo-Jewish gentry evinced a strong antipathy to Zionism. Louis was one of the ten signatories of an infamous letter, published in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> on 23 April 1919, implicating foreign-born Jews in the spread of Bolshevism in England. Louis's action outraged the impoverished Yiddish-speaking members of the federation's affiliated congregations, and Davis (who spoke fluent Yiddish but also impeccable English) put himself at their head. On 25 November 1925 Davis persuaded the board of the federation to permit delegates to speak in Yiddish. Louis Montagu acknowledged that he could not understand Yiddish and resigned. On 20 March 1928 Davis succeeded to the presidency of the federation, a move which symbolized and signalled the first major transfer of power within Anglo-Jewry from the moneyed Anglicized aristocracy to the sons of the immigrant generation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Davis had risen in the ranks of the Stepney central Labour Party. Founded in 1918, its creation owed much to its Jewish secretary, the immigrant chemist Oscar Tobin. It was to Tobin's pharmacy in Harford Street, Mile End, that the young Major Clement Attlee had come on his discharge from the army, there to learn the politics of the East End and to take the first steps in his own political career. Tobin had studied the demography of political power in Stepney, and had reached the simple conclusion that a party which retained the support of the Jews and the Irish was bound to win control of the borough council. Tobin forged an alliance with the Irish Catholic community in the borough, and in November 1919 Labour, never having held a single seat on the council, swept to power; Attlee became the borough's first Labour mayor.<br>
<br>Davis appointed himself Tobin's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and heir. He made friends with Attlee, who was instrumental in arranging for his election as an alderman of the borough in 1921. That November Tobin became the first Jewish mayor of Stepney. The following year Davis was elected vice-president of the Stepney Labour Party, and within a few years he had succeeded in gaining election to the key committees of the council, becoming in 1928 chairman of its finance committee. In 1930 Davis became mayor, and in 1935 he succeeded to the council leadership. Meanwhile, in 1925, he had secured election to the London county council.<br>
<br>Davis's leadership of Stepney borough council, like that of the Federation of Synagogues, became highly controversial. He steered the federation along the Zionist course its rank and file wished it to go, but at the same time he turned his presidency into (literally) an unelected dictatorship. His political alliance with the Irish Catholics on the borough council was unshakeable. But with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 this alliance became a source of weakness rather than of strength. On the whole, East End Jewry adopted a position sympathetic to the Spanish republicans. Irish support for General Franco acted, therefore, as a powerful solvent of the Jewish&#150;Irish dialogue that had characterized East End politics hitherto. Davis took very little active part in combating the fascist menace in Jewish Stepney in 1936&#150;7; in February 1937 he and three other Jewish councillors voted to permit the British Union of Fascists to hold a meeting in Limehouse town hall.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, apparently well-founded allegations of wholesale corruption surfaced against Davis and his Irish allies on Stepney council. In October 1940 Herbert Morrison, then minister of home security in Churchill's wartime coalition government, bowed to local pressure by stripping Davis of his role as air raid precautions controller in the borough. These events brought Labour in Stepney into disrepute, and were in part responsible for the growing popularity of communism in the borough. They also impinged on Davis's presidency of the federation. Davis had been able to dispense with elections for offices in the federation, and his retainers saw to it that opponents of his dictatorship were cowed into silence. But the reputation of the federation fell as a result, and it was under Davis that it began its long decline within the communal structure of Anglo-Jewry.<br>
<br>To his enemies Davis was utterly ruthless. To his friends, and to those whom he befriended, no act of kindness was too small for him to undertake. But in the second half of 1944 his careers came to an abrupt end. Attempting to avoid prosecution for alleged non-payment of a railway fare by inciting a Stepney council employee to provide him with a false national identity card, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On his release from gaol he became a recluse, perhaps mentally unstable, and died (of heart disease) in West Heath, a private nursing home in north-west London, on 15 March 1985. He was buried next to his parents at the Federation Jewish cemetery, Edmonton. He never married and left no heir.<br>
