<span class="headword">Tennant, Sir  Iain Mark</span>  (1919&#150;2006), <span class="occ">television executive and businessman</span>, was born on 11 March 1919 at Hyndford House, North Berwick, Haddingtonshire, the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel John Edward Tennant (1890&#150;1941), army and air force officer, and his first wife, Georgina Helen, daughter of General Sir George Macaulay Kirkpatrick. He was descended from Charles Tennant, a fabulously rich Glasgow chemical manufacturer. His father, who had served in the Scots Guards and then commanded the Royal Flying Corps in Mesopotamia at the end of the First World War, divorced his wife in 1925 and was remarried the following year to Victoria Duff, daughter of Sir Robert Duff, second baronet, with whom he had four further children (two son and two daughters). Despite these family upheavals Tennant had a happy childhood. During holidays he developed a love of Scotland at Innes House in Moray, the home of his grandfather Francis John Tennant, and at the Hambro home at Glendoe, near Fort Augustus&#151;Jocelyn Hambro being a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>Tennant was educated at Eton College, where he rowed for the school, and then at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his passion for the cinema and playing bridge led to his going down after his first year. With an ambition to enter the film industry, in which his family had interests, he worked briefly in studios at Welwyn Garden City before being called up on the outbreak of the Second World War. He was commissioned into the 2nd battalion of the Scots Guards as an intelligence officer in 1940. He was captured at Tobruk in 1942. In prisoner-of-war camps in Italy and Germany he was much involved in entertainment essential to maintaining morale, sometimes staging productions five times a week. His father (who had joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a group captain) was killed in action in 1941 and his grandfather died the following year, leaving him Innes House and part of his estate. The remainder, with Lochnabo House near Lhanbryde, was left to Tennant's only surviving uncle, (Francis) Michael Tennant. He left the army in 1946 with the rank of captain and settled at Innes House. On 11 July that year he married Lady Margaret Isla Helen Marion Ogilvy (<i>b</i>. 1920), second daughter of David Lyulph Gore Wolseley Ogilvy, seventh or twelfth earl of Airlie, with whom he had three children, Mark (<i>b</i>. 1947), Christopher (1950&#150;2003), and Emma (<i>b</i>. 1954).<br>
<br>After the war Tennant worked briefly for the Inverness-based Caledonian Associated Cinemas, which had a string of some fifty cinemas across Scotland and was partly owned by the Tennants. Chaired by Sir Alexander Boyne King, Caledonian was a serious Scottish challenger to the dominant American ABC Films. Tennant became a non-executive director in 1950, a position he held until the business was sold thirty years later. When the film <span class="italic">The Dam Busters</span> was made in the early 1950s he acted as a gofer in the production. Such was his enthusiasm for the silver screen that he had a cinema fitted up in the old kitchen at Innes House where he could preview films. During the 1950s and early 1960s Caledonian continued to acquire new cinemas and through King formed a close relationship with Films of Scotland. In 1960 King, by way of a subsidiary, Caledonian Television, bid successfully for the franchise for commercial television in the north of Scotland. Renamed Grampian Television, with King as chairman and Tennant as vice-chairman, it went on air the following year, assisted by Howard Steele of Associated-British Picture Corporation. On King's retirement in 1968 Tennant succeeded him as chairman of both Grampian and Caledonian, positions he was to hold for a further twenty years. Under his chairmanship the brevity of Grampian's board meetings was compensated for by extensive peregrinations around the transmission area as far north as Shetland and as far west as the Hebrides.<br>
<br>Tennant's skill as a non-executive director earned him directorships of the Times Publishing Company from 1962 to 1966 and from 1968 to 1989 of the Clydesdale Bank, a subsidiary of the Midland Bank until 1987. His greatest delight was his chairmanship of Glenlivet Distillers from 1964 until 1984. This was a period of expansion for both blended whisky and single malts. Tennant oversaw the merger with the blenders Hill Thomson &amp; Co. of Edinburgh and with Longmorn-Glenlivet Distilleries in 1972. Although annoyed that the Imperial Group without telling him sold its stake in the company to the Canadian Seagram Corporation in 1977 to give it control, he continued to serve as chairman and joined the Seagram board. During his time as chairman of the company he visited over forty countries as an ambassador for its brands.<br>
<br>Tennant devoted time and energy to public service, particularly in Moray. He served as a county councillor, founded the Moray Sea School in 1949, and in 1963 was appointed lord lieutenant. He became a governor of Gordonstoun School in 1951 and served as chairman from 1957 to 1970; he brought his business acumen to bear in restoring its precarious financial position. During his time as chairman the prince of Wales was a pupil at the school, often spending weekends at Innes House. A member of the Royal Company of Archers from 1950, Tennant was an usher at the coronation in 1953 when he had to sit on the steps beside the pew he was guarding. On sitting down the seam of his trousers split with a loud retort, whereupon a peeress leaned forward to inquire if he needed a needle and thread, as she had one tucked in her coronet. The official appointment he cherished above every other position he held was as crown estate commissioner for Scotland from 1970 to 1990. Although the bulk of the crown lands in Scotland were on Speyside, there were holdings scattered across the country. In just the same way as he made the board of Grampian Television patrol its territory he insisted on visiting crown property in every part of the country to ensure it was well managed and the tenants satisfied. From 1981 to 1986 he served on the newspaper panel of the Monopolies and Mergers Committee. The queen appointed him a knight of the Thistle in 1986 and lord high commissioner to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1988 and 1989.<br>
<br>Tennant's wife never cared for Innes House and when he was unexpectedly left Lochnabo House on the death of his uncle Michael in 1973 the family moved there and Innes House remained empty for some twenty years. Tennant died at Lochnabo on 25 September 2006 of bronchopneumonia and immobility, having suffered increasingly from Parkinson's disease. The funeral service was held at Gordonstoun School on 14 October. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, and two of their children.<br>
