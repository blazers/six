<span class="headword">Archibald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1198), <span class="occ">administrator and abbot of Dunfermline</span>, was of unknown origins. He became abbot in 1178 or 1179, and soon after his appointment witnessed two <i>acta</i> of King William the Lion (<i>r</i>. 1165&#150;1214), one being the foundation grant for the king's major new abbey at Arbroath. He also witnessed <i>acta</i> of Hugh, bishop of St Andrews from 1178 to 1188, the king's candidate in the disputed election to that see in 1178. He is likely to have been one of the Scottish envoys to Pope Lucius III (<i>r</i>. 1181&#150;5) in the spring of 1182 in connection with that dispute; a bull confirming Dunfermline Abbey's possessions was issued at Velletri on 30 April 1182. This journey was possibly the occasion of his receiving (very unusually for a Scot) a writ of protection from Henry II of England, no doubt seeking to ward off during his absence unwanted attentions on the abbey's lands in Lothian from the English garrison then in Edinburgh Castle.<br>
<br>Little more is known of Archibald's care for Dunfermline's estate and church, except for a few grants of land made by him; during his rule gifts were made to the abbey by William the Lion and others. In addition to his loyalty to the king in the St Andrews dispute, and his many appearances as a witness to royal <i>acta</i> (there taking precedence over other abbots), he had probably also shown a talent for administration, for there then developed another side of his career, unique in twelfth-century Scotland, that of an abbot fully involved in the king's secular business. After the late 1180s he appears regularly and conspicuously as a royal adviser and servant, perambulating marches, granting sasine of lands, acting on the king's behalf in court, witnessing agreements there, and surveying and recording lands and rents. He was active in at least eight major royal centres throughout Scotland. Some of his work was probably a resumption and review of royal rents in the south of Scotland after the restoration of Roxburgh and Berwick castles in 1190&#150;91. Whatever his official title in all this (if indeed he had one), he was evidently versatile and useful. By 1195, at the latest, this part of his career had ended; a record of it, now lost, &#145;the roll of Abbot Archibald of ancient rents in money and ancient waitings&#146;  (Thomson, 1.118), was still in the Scottish royal archives in 1296, and so probably had some importance beyond his lifetime. Archibald was still alive in February 1198, but died, perhaps before 24 August, in that year.<br>
