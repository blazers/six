<span class="headword">Wilberforce,  Henry William</span>  (1807&#150;1873), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert and journalist</span>, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29386/', "William Wilberforce (1759&#150;1833)")</script>, politician and philanthropist, and his wife, Barbara Ann Spooner (1777&#150;1847), was born at Clapham, Surrey, on 22 September 1807. Two of his elder brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29384/', "Robert Isaac Wilberforce")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29385/', "Samuel Wilberforce")</script>. At the age of nine Henry was sent for private tuition to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24666/', "Revd John Sargent")</script>, rector of Graffham, Sussex. He was transferred six years later with his brother Samuel to the Revd F. R. Spragge's establishment at Little Bounds, Bidborough, Kent. He matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, on 16 March 1826, going into residence the following Michaelmas term. During four long vacations he read with John Henry Newman, whose intimate friend he became. He was active in the debates of the Oxford Union, of which he was elected president. He graduated BA in 1830 with a first class in classics and a second class in mathematics. Initially intending to become a barrister, he was admitted to study at Lincoln's Inn in 1831, but he continued to reside at Oxford, where he won the Ellerton theological prize and took his MA degree in 1833.<br>
<br>Under Newman's influence Wilberforce decided to give up the law and take holy orders. He was ordained deacon in 1834 and immediately appointed by his relative Charles Richard Sumner, bishop of Winchester, perpetual curate of Bransgore, on the edge of the New Forest. He had just married, on 24 July 1834, Mary (1811&#150;1878), the fourth daughter of his former tutor John Sargent. One of her sisters married his brother Samuel; another married Henry Edward Manning. They had five sons and four daughters; four of the children died young. Wilberforce was an ardent supporter of the Tractarian movement, with advanced liturgical ideas which he put into practice in his parishes. In 1838 he published <span class="italic">The Parochial System: an Appeal to English Churchmen</span>, a plea for church extension and lay stewardship. In 1841 the archbishop of Canterbury nominated him to the vicarage of Walmer, near Deal. In 1843, on the suggestion of the prince consort, he was presented by the lord chancellor to the wealthy vicarage of East Farleigh, near Maidstone, held some years earlier by his brother Robert.<br>
<br>Preceded by his wife, Wilberforce was received into the Roman Catholic church on 15 September 1850, resigning his vicarage. He published <span class="italic">Reasons for Submitting to the Catholic Church: a Farewell Letter to his Parishioners</span> in 1851, which led to a controversy and reached its sixth edition in 1855. As a married former parson, he was excluded from both his clerical and legal vocations. There was little employment for him in his new church, and he was often in financial difficulties; but his spirits were never dampened. In 1852 he became secretary of the newly founded Catholic Defence Association in Dublin. This led to the publication of <span class="italic">Proselytism in Ireland</span> (1852), a correspondence between him and the Revd Alexander Dallas on the latter's Irish church missions. In 1854 Wilberforce became proprietor and editor of a London weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Catholic Standard</span>, renamed in 1855 the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span>. In the politics of Roman Catholic journalism the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span> was the Liberal rival of the tory <span class="italic">Tablet</span>. Wilberforce was cautiously supportive of the liberal Catholics Sir John Acton and Richard Simpson and their <span class="italic">Rambler</span> and <span class="italic">Home and Foreign Review</span>. Wearying of the burden of editing a weekly, Wilberforce put the <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span> up for sale in 1863 and sold it in 1864. Thereafter he confined his journalism to writing more than twenty articles and reviews for the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, seven of which were posthumously published by his sons as <span class="italic">The Church and the Empires</span> (1874), with a biographical memoir by Newman. Throughout his life it was this good man's fate to be overshadowed by more distinguished connections. A journey to Jamaica having failed to restore his health, Wilberforce died on 23 April 1873 at his residence, Chester House, Stroud, Gloucestershire, and was buried in the nearby Dominican churchyard at Woodchester.<br>
