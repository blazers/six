<span class="headword">Faldo,  John</span>  (1633/4&#150;1691), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister and religious controversialist</span>, is of unknown parentage. He is said to have been educated at Cambridge but does not appear in the records of the university and is first heard of as a chaplain to Colonel John Hewson's regiment during the civil war. He also preached to Robert Lilburne's regiment. By 1669 he was living at East Barnet, Hertfordshire, and preaching in nearby Chipping Barnet in a hired room. He was licensed as a nonconformist preacher at Chipping Barnet on 13 May 1672, although the designation &#145;presbyterian&#146; may well be a clerical error as he was described as &#145;congregational&#146;  (Gordon, 261), on his application for a licence for preaching in a room at Wood Street, Chipping Barnet, in the same year. <br>
<br>Replying to the Quaker William Penn's <span class="italic">Spirit of Truth</span> (1672), Faldo published a 370-page anti-Quaker tract, <span class="italic">Quakerism No Christianity</span> (1672). To this Penn replied in the 254 pages of <span class="italic">Quakerism a New Nick-name for Old Christianity</span> (1673), for which Faldo offered only the 96-page <span class="italic">Vindication of Quakerism No Christianity</span> (1673). Penn again replied with <span class="italic">The Invalidity of John Faldo's Vindication</span> (1673). Faldo then issued a challenge to Penn to have a public debate, but Penn declined. After further publications, a new edition of Faldo's first work in the controversy, <span class="italic">Quakerism No Christianity</span>, was published in 1675 with an &#145;epistle&#146; commending it and its author by &#145;21 learned divines&#146;, leading London nonconformists of a moderate persuasion, including five Independent or congregational and eleven clearly presbyterian leaders, men such as Thomas Jenkyn, Thomas Manton, Matthew Barker, and George Griffith. The epistle's plea to Quakers, &#145;honest, well-meaning, ignorant persons&#146;  (Faldo, &#145;epistle&#146;, <span class="italic">Quakerism</span>, 1675 edn, unpag. 7), not to confuse strict morality with theological wisdom strongly suggests the pen of Richard Baxter, who was indeed one of the twenty-one. A rather fierce two-page &#145;letter to the reader&#146; was also included, written by four ministers from Theobalds and Chipping Barnet representing Faldo's Hertfordshire friends. Penn answered this latest work and the controversy then closed with Faldo's reply, <span class="italic">XXI Divines Cleared</span> (1675), which added little to the debate. <br>
<br>Faldo's tracts covered many of the issues raised in earlier debates between Quakers and other Christians: the sacramental ordinances; whether &#145;the word of God&#146; referred primarily to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> or to Christ; whether Jesus's resurrection was physical or spiritual; whether the historical Jesus was the source of human salvation or was merely the prototype life in a &#145;prepared body&#146; of the eternal Christ-spirit who must transform people within; whether the spirit's inspiration could still produce moral perfection and infallible messages. Before they descended to biblical &#145;Billingsgate&#146;, Penn's and Faldo's pamphlet war served a useful purpose in forcing them to authenticate and clarify their doctrinal beliefs. <br>
<br>After the controversy Faldo continued in his ministry. He was fined for preaching in February 1683 and in 1684 was in Newgate for the same offence. He was chosen minister of the congregational church at Plaisterers Hall, Addle Street, Aldermanbury, in 1684, apparently preaching to a congregation of some 2000, and later moved his church to Ropemakers' Alley, Moorfields. In 1687 he published a fine book of sermons, <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Gospel of Peace, and of the Government of our own Spirits</span>, dedicated to Lady Clinton, and in the same year was among eight Independent ministers who took an address of thanks to James II for his declaration for the liberty of conscience. After the revolution of 1688 and the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span> in 1689, Faldo and the nine still living from the twenty-one, notably Griffith and Barker, shared in the short-lived &#145;happy union&#146; of presbyterians and congregationalists and Faldo was one of seven congregational managers of the resulting common fund for the support of ministers. <br>
<br>Faldo's will of 5 February 1691 named his wife, Mary, as executor and left her property in Essex and Hertfordshire, including a house at Rye Hill, Epping. Faldo died from gallstones on 7 February 1691 and was buried in Bunhill Fields, London, in the fifty-seventh year of his age according to his tombstone. John Quick preached his funeral sermon and singled out his reputation as a reconciler of the differences between the sects for praise: &#145;If the peace-makers are blessed, and shall be called the children of God, then blessed is Mr Faldo; who had an especial hand in the healing of our breaches&#146;  (Quick, 30). Mary Faldo died on 5 March 1706.<br>
