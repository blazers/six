<span class="headword">Clinton,  Henry Fiennes  Pelham-</span>, ninth earl of Lincoln and second duke of Newcastle under Lyme  (1720&#150;1794), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born Henry Fiennes Clinton on 16 April 1720, either at Stourton, Lincolnshire, or at Westminster, London, and baptized on 24 April at St James's, Westminster, the second son of Henry Clinton, seventh earl of Lincoln (1684&#150;1728), a ministerial and household office-holder, and Lucy (1692&#150;1736), daughter of Thomas, first Baron Pelham. He succeeded his elder brother, George, who had become the eighth earl in 1728, as ninth earl on 30 April 1730. He was educated at Eton College from 1733, tutored by John Hume (later Bishop Hume), and in 1737 entered Clare College, Cambridge, where in 1749 he was made a doctor of laws. After travelling on the continent, he returned to England in late 1741 and charmed George II, who called him &#145;<i>the handsomest man in</i> <i>England</i>&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 30.31).<br>
<br>Having come of age, Lincoln took his seat in the Lords on 1 December 1741 and followed the political lead of his mother's brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21789/', "Henry Pelham")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21801/', "Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle upon Tyne")</script>, who both served as prime minister. A haughty and loose-living man, Lincoln was described by his friend Horace Walpole as &#145;a very dark thin young nobleman, who did not look so much of the Hercules, as he said he was himself&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 30.1). He was compared to the comte de Guise and depicted in the study &#145;Patapan, or, The Little White Dog&#146; by Walpole, who also composed verses to &#145;Little Peggy&#146;, the daughter born in 1743 to Lincoln and his mistress of humble birth, Peggy Lee  (ibid., 30.38, 76&#150;7, 294, 307). Despite having been deeply enamoured of Lady Sophia Fermor (1721&#150;1745), he married, on 3 October 1744, his first cousin (his uncle Henry's daughter), Catherine Pelham (1727&#150;1760), which occasioned a quarrel between the brothers about the future control of the family's estates. Lincoln, who had already in 1742 been appointed lord lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, which he remained until 1757, and had become a lord of the bedchamber in January 1743, received from his uncles a series of lucrative offices: he was made master of the jewel office in 1744, cofferer of the household in 1747 (which he held until 1754), joint comptroller of the customs of London in 1749, and auditor of the exchequer in 1751. He was nominated a knight of the Garter on 13 March and installed on 4 June 1752.<br>
<br>That Lincoln was destined to be heir to his childless uncle Thomas was confirmed on 13 November 1756, when Newcastle was additionally created duke of Newcastle under Lyme, with a special remainder to Lincoln. Yet, although the touchy Newcastle required constant attention and selfless loyalty, Lincoln was increasingly impatient with him and relations between them deteriorated. In 1757 Lincoln opposed the formation of the Pitt&#150;Newcastle coalition and in 1762, after Newcastle had left office, he only reluctantly resigned as a lord of the bedchamber to George III. Thereafter, as Walpole wrote, ministers &#145;never had much reason to complain of Lord Lincoln's hostilities. His exceeding pride kept him excluded from the world, and rarely did he appear either at court or in parliament&#146;. He soon attached himself to William Pitt, earl of Chatham, &#145;with constant derision of, and insult to, his uncle&#146;, who bitterly resented the &#145;open ingratitude&#146; of his favourite nephew  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 30.178&#150;9). It is possible that the death of the countess of Lincoln, to whom the duke of Newcastle had been very attached, diminished his loyalty to the Pelham cause. The final breach came at the general election of 1768, when Lincoln used his influence at Newark, where Newcastle had already made over property to him, to promote his own interest at the expense of his uncle's. On 17 November 1768 he succeeded as second duke of Newcastle under Lyme, and by royal licence on 1 December that year he took the additional surname of Pelham. He was also appointed steward of Sherwood Forest and lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire, where he inherited his predecessor's estates and extensive electoral patronage, and he was sworn of the privy council on 16 December 1768.<br>
<br>Newcastle was the only peer to pronounce Elizabeth Chudleigh, duchess of Kingston, &#145;guilty erroneously, but not intentionally&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 20.624&#150;5) when she was convicted of bigamy in the House of Lords on 22 April 1776. He preferred the pleasures of sport and the country to a life of politics, although he held several local offices, including (from 1759) the high stewardship of Westminster. He died, following a paralytic stroke, at his London house in Palace Yard, Westminster, on 22 February 1794, and, although having lived mostly at Oatlands, near Weybridge, Surrey, chose to be buried in the family vault at Bamber, Lincolnshire. By his will (dated 11 May 1793) he passed over his elder son, Thomas Pelham-Clinton, the third duke (1752&#150;1795), of whose marriage he disapproved, in favour of his grandson Henry (1785&#150;1851), who the following year became the fourth duke of Newcastle under Lyme.<br>
