<span class="headword">Kerr <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Newland]</span>,  Antonella Reuss <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>, marchioness of Lothian  (1922&#150;2007), <span class="occ">journalist and charity founder</span>, was born in Rome on 22 May 1922, the only child of Major-General Sir Foster Reuss Newland (1862&#150;1943), Royal Army Medical Corps doctor and director of Middle East medical services, and his wife, Donna Nennella (Agnes), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Salazar y Munatones, daughter of Count Michele Salazar, a lieutenant-general in the Italian army. Her parents were married in 1918 when her father was fifty-six, her mother twenty; the marriage was dissolved in 1928. Her mother then married William Greenwood Carr, a young army officer who later became a brigadier and lieutenant of the king's bodyguard of the yeomen of the guard. They had one further daughter, Annabel (<i>b</i>. 1930), who later married the thirteenth Earl Ferrers.<br>
<br>As an army officer's daughter Tony Newland had a peripatetic childhood, the more so after her parents divorced. She divided her life between Rome and San Remo in Italy, and Suffolk. She was home-educated with a group of cousins; unusually, this was in the liberal teaching methods of the Parents' National Educational Union movement. Like many young women of her class and generation she was sent to Munich to be &#145;finished&#146; in 1936. There she came across the horrors of fascism and master-race eugenics, political ideologies that provoked in her a lasting care and concern for &#145;the voiceless weak&#146; and a determination to help those in trouble.<br>
<br>In 1940 a brief time at Oxford was interrupted by wartime duty as a nursing auxiliary. She always regretted not finishing her education, but it was at Oxford that she met up again with a childhood friend, Peter Francis Walter Kerr, twelfth marquess of Lothian (1922&#150;2004). He was serving in the Scots Guards when they married on 30 April 1943 at the Brompton Oratory in Knightsbridge, London. After the war they lived in one of the remaining Kerr family properties, Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire, which they renovated and opened to the public in 1951. (Peter's predecessor as marquess of Lothian had bequeathed Blickling Hall in Norfolk to the National Trust, and Newbattle Abbey to the Scottish universities.) In 1950 they moved to the Scottish borders and began the restoration of Monteviot, the family's 18,000 acre country estate near Jedburgh, into which they eventually moved in 1962. But she was most proud of their rescue of Ferniehirst, a &#145;frontier castle&#146; in the borders dating back to the seventeenth century, to which they retired in 1986. While she was proud of her husband's ancestral inheritance in the Scottish borders, she was unimpressed by the pomp of the aristocracy: &#145;I suddenly assumed an identity that had nothing to do with me&#146;  (Paton, 58&#150;9). But she managed to pull off the trick of being both establishment and anti-establishment throughout her life.<br>
<br>Between 1944 and 1957 Tony and Peter Lothian had six children. They were active parents; he the quiet one, fond of jazz and playing the piano, she more outgoing and flamboyant. In 1949 she was asked to edit <span class="italic">Catholic Mother</span>, the quarterly magazine of the Catholic Mothers' Union. The circulation rose from 2000 to 20,000 by the time she left in 1961. She delighted in commissioning articles from friends such as Elizabeth Pakenham and Evelyn Waugh. In 1960 she was offered a weekly column in the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Express</span> by its editor, Ian McColl (who is reputed to have said that if she could increase his readership too by 20,000 she was hired). Her trial article on trade sanctions against Rhodesia made the centre spread. For fourteen years she wrote (on the floor at home, in longhand and surrounded by children) on the critical social issues of the 1960s and 1970s, from working women to sex education, drugs, and youth. Balanced comment was her aim on all subjects, but as she later said, balance was not fashionable at the time. &#145;This&#146;, she said, &#145;gave me profound respect for the media men and women who told the truth&#146;  (Paton, 42). Her respect for those journalists who did fearlessly tell the truth led to her setting up, in 1974, the Valiant for Truth award with her good friends the American Marxist editor Mikki Doyle and the actress Renee Goddard.<br>
<br>Long before then, in 1955, came the project for which Tony Lothian was best remembered. In that year she persuaded Odette Hallowes, the former Second World War resistance fighter, and Lady Georgina Coleridge, the formidable &#145;Lady G&#146;, a magazine editor and publisher, and subsequently also Violet Attlee, wife of the former prime minister, to help her launch a Luncheon to celebrate women of achievement from all walks of life. The post-war achievements of women in business, academe, the trades, and professions were at the time generally ignored. Men had their clubs, their exclusive dinners, and established structures for status and recognition; women, for the most part, had nothing remotely similar. The Women of the Year Luncheon, held annually at the Savoy Hotel in London, set out to fill this gap. Artists might sit next to hospital matrons; a thatcher next to a station master, racing driver, or pop singer; Marxists next to high tories.<br>
<br>Every woman who attended the lunch was a &#145;woman of the year&#146;. They came by invitation only, each guest paying for her ticket. Any profits went to charity, originally the Greater London Fund for the Blind, but later the foundation set up by the Women of the Year Luncheon to fund entrepreneurial projects for women around the world. There was a certain irony about the original choice of charity: Hallowes, Coleridge, and Lothian all subsequently had eye problems (Tony Lothian lost an eye to cancer), and from 1970 onwards each wore an eye-patch at the lunches. In her own style of red or white shirt, black waistcoat, and black skirt, Lothian cut &#145;a rakish, piratical-looking figure with a cockatoo shock of dark hair, a black eye-patch and what looks suspiciously like an Irish shillelagh&#146;  (Paton, 5). Guests included Valentina Tereshkova, who became a good friend and received Tony Lothian on several visits to Moscow for international conventions, and about whom she later wrote a book, <span class="italic">Valentina, First Woman in Space</span> (1993). Other notable national and international guests included Margaret Thatcher, Queen Noor of Jordan, Princess Margaret, Princess Diana, Coretta King, Jung Chang, and Simone Weil. Tony Lothian met many of the guests through her work as vice-president of the Royal College of Nursing (1960&#150;80), court patron of the Royal College of Gynaecologists, patron of the National Council of Women, and president of the Institute of Journalists.<br>
<br>Tony Lothian was appointed OBE in 1997 for services to women and blind people, and became a dame of St Gregory in 2002 for her work in interfaith understanding. She was the first president of the Order of Unity, which later became the Scottish Order of Christian Unity. She said that her major inspirations were Emmeline Pankhurst and Hildegard of Bingen. She died at Ferniehirst Castle on 6 January 2007, after a stroke. Her funeral and requiem mass were held on 15 January at St David's Roman Catholic Church, Dalkeith. A memorial service was held at Westminster Cathedral on 11 June 2007. She was survived by all six children. Her elder son, Michael, known as Michael Ancram (<i>b</i>. 1945), Conservative politician, had succeeded his father as thirteenth marquess of Lothian. In honour of her life and work, in 2009 her daughter Elizabeth, countess of Dalkeith, set up the Tony Lothian Biographers' Club prize for uncommissioned first-time writers of biography.<br>
