<span class="headword">Walsingham,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1340&#150;<em>c.</em>1422), <span class="occ">historian and prior of Wymondham</span>, probably came from Walsingham in Norfolk. An entry in the register of Simon Sudbury (<i>d</i>. 1381), bishop of London between 1362 and 1375, mentions that Thomas Walsingham, a monk of St Albans from the diocese of Norwich, was ordained priest on 21 September 1364. That entry suggests he was born <i>c</i>.1340. It is probable, although not entirely certain, that some time before 1376 Walsingham studied at Oxford, for in criticizing the university in his <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> on account of its association with Lollardy, he disclaimed any disloyalty on his own part. The one piece of evidence to determine his position within St Albans before the 1390s is an entry in the <span class="italic">Liber benefactorum</span>  (BL, Cotton MS Nero D.vii) which he himself compiled in 1380. There he is described as precentor and <i>scriptorarius</i> of St Albans Abbey, and appears twenty-second in a list of fifty-four monks. In September 1394 he became prior of the cell at Wymondham, Norfolk, and this is the only time when he is known to have been absent from St Albans. In 1396 he was recalled to St Albans at his own request after the death of abbot Thomas de la Mare in that year. The abbot's death appears to coincide with a change in Walsingham's position. After 1396 he was no longer termed <i>scriptorarius</i>, and he never again held a senior post within the abbey. None the less he continued work on his chronicles for a further twenty years. The last historical work with which his name is undoubtedly associated is the <span class="italic">Ypodigma Neustriae</span>, which he dedicated to Henry V about 1420. He almost certainly died shortly after this, about 1422, probably at St Albans.<br>
<br>Walsingham has been described as the last of the great medieval chroniclers. But although he was pre-eminently a writer of history, his interests were by no means confined to historical writing. Apart from the <span class="italic">Liber benefactorum</span>, a work of St Albans piety, Walsingham wrote a treatise on monasticism which follows the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> in BL, Cotton MS Claudius E.iv, and also a treatise on mensural music. This latter work  (BL, Lansdowne MS 763, fols. 97<i>v</i>&#150;104<i>v</i>) arose out of his duties as precentor. In this treatise Walsingham discussed such matters as the note shapes, the durational values of various note forms, and concluded with a consideration of rhythmic modes. Walsingham's treatise is one of a handful surviving in England from this period, and the knowledge of continental treatises that it reveals lends weight to the possibility of an Oxford background to his writing. Walsingham also displayed an interest in the literature of antiquity. This interest is seen in a number of works, including the <span class="italic">Archana deorum</span>, which was a commentary on Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, dedicated by Walsingham to Simon Southerey, prior of St Albans (1396/7&#150;1405). Walsingham also wrote the <span class="italic">Dites ditatus</span>, which was a version of Dictys of Crete's history of the Trojan War, a history of Alexander, and the <span class="italic">Prohemia poetarum</span>, which contained an account of classical and medieval authors.<br>
<br>Walsingham's historical writing was cast in a traditional mould. If he is the last true representative of the great St Albans school of history that is partly because of the influence of Matthew Paris (<i>d</i>. 1259). That influence is seen not only in the form of Walsingham's history, but also in his attempt to make his <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> a continuation of the work of Matthew Paris. Although it was once thought that there were at the end of the fourteenth century a number of chroniclers writing at St Albans, the work of V. H. Galbraith has shown that during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries there was one author only, namely Thomas Walsingham, who in addition to a <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, which he began in 1376, wrote a number of other historical works. The most authoritative text of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> itself is found in two manuscripts, BL, Royal MS 13 E.ix, which contains a text to 1392, and Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 462, a later manuscript, which continues the narrative to 1420. Internal references indicate that Walsingham was the author of the Royal manuscript, which was written at St Albans during the late 1390s, and of the early part of the &#145;short chronicle&#146;, which was an abbreviation of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> extending to 1419. Although there are no personal references to Walsingham in the later part of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, or in the &#145;short chronicle&#146;, he is the most probable author of these parts of the narrative also. It seems likely that both the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> and the &#145;short chronicle&#146; were initially composed in stages during the 1380s and 1390s, and that drafts of both versions were in circulation before Walsingham went to Wymondham in 1394. At some point Walsingham added a retrospective section to the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, beginning in 1272, in order to link the history of his own times to those of Matthew Paris.<br>
<br>One problem relating to the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> concerns the opening section of the contemporary chronicle in 1376. This opening section is notable for its criticism of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and its sympathetic account of the Good Parliament of that year. Because of the outspoken references to Gaunt it appears that this section was removed from the Royal manuscript by the monks at St Albans during the 1390s, and possibly as late as 1399. The opening is now to be found in three manuscripts: Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 316 (a <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> in which only one leaf of this early history remains); BL, Harley MS 3634 (a section of which once formed part of Bodley 316); and BL, Cotton MS Otho C.ii, which survives in a fragmentary and mutilated form. These three manuscripts contain the so-called &#145;scandalous chronicle&#146;, a narrative of the years 1376&#150;7, and a comparison of their texts reveals that the process of revision had begun before the removal of this section of the chronicle from the Royal manuscript.<br>
<br>If Walsingham is traditionally the chronicler of the Lancastrian revolution, his history is also a major source for the history of Richard II's reign. It describes in detail events such as the peasants' revolt, the emergence of John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384), and the political struggles of the reign. Walsingham's account of the early Lancastrian kings, although valuable, was composed on a smaller scale, and after 1399 he never again quite recaptured the zest of his earlier writing. His work, considered as a whole, is significant for several reasons. It preserves firstly a valuable record of political events. St Albans was an important centre, and Walsingham was well placed to receive information concerning events in London and elsewhere. His history gives some indication also of the change in attitude of the St Albans community towards the leading personalities of the day. Although Walsingham began his chronicle in 1376 in a manner bitterly hostile to John of Gaunt, during the 1380s his opinion of Gaunt changed, and he came to praise the duke for his patience and moderation. Yet as Gaunt's star rose so that of Richard declined in Walsingham's narrative, and he viewed more critically a king whom he felt did not adequately fulfil the role of kingship. Walsingham's work is again of the greatest interest because of the manner in which it reveals a medieval history in the process of being revised.<br>
<br>Although Walsingham was for a time the official chronicler of his house, and many of the opinions expressed in the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> were undoubtedly those of the St Albans community, he brought to his work a viewpoint and qualities of his own. Thus Walsingham was more of a scholar than Matthew Paris if less of a literary artist. In outlook he was thoroughly conservative, resisting change, and particularly hostile to the ideas of John Wyclif. His interests were mainly if not entirely insular. Although he dealt with events such as the conciliar movement, it was England and the political struggle at home that concerned him most. Throughout the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> his prejudices inform his writing. Thus he disliked foreigners, had little sympathy with the lower sections of society, and disapproved of the mendicants.<br>
<br>In addition to the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> and the &#145;short chronicle&#146;, Walsingham's other historical writings are of some importance. In the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span> he once more continued the work of Matthew Paris. He recast Matthew Paris's account of the abbots of St Albans which had been continued to 1308, and wrote a further continuation from 1308 to 1393 dealing at length with the abbacy of Thomas de la Mare. It seems probable that the <span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, written in the early 1390s, was never put into a final shape because of Walsingham's move to Wymondham and Abbot Thomas's death. A continuation which extends to 1411, found in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 7, is unlikely to be the work of Walsingham himself. Walsingham's last piece of historical writing was the <span class="italic">Ypodigma Neustriae</span>, an epitome of English history from 911 to 1419. From 1377 to 1419 this was little more than a recapitulation of the &#145;short chronicle&#146;. With Walsingham's death the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> itself came to an end, and with it a form of historical writing that went back to the days of Wendover and Paris.<br>
<br>In its own day Walsingham's narrative attracted an audience outside St Albans. It was used by the first author of the <span class="italic">Historia vitae et regni Ricardi secundi</span>, and parts of its text were incorporated in certain of the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> continuations. In more recent times the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> has suffered from the disadvantage of not having been printed as a continuous whole. A form of the text of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> to 1406 is found in three separate publications in the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>, in the first two of which it is combined with sections from the &#145;short chronicle&#146;. The years 1376&#150;7 are found in the <span class="italic">Chronicon Angliae</span>  (pp. 68&#150;147); 1377&#150;92 in the <span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>  (1.329&#150;484; 2.1&#150;211); and 1393&#150;1406 in the <span class="italic">Annales Ricardi II et Henrici IV</span>  (pp. 155&#150;420). The <span class="italic">Chronicon Angliae</span>, edited by E. Maunde Thompson, was taken from an early and partially revised manuscript of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> found in BL, Harley MS 3634, which concludes in 1382. This edition contains the valuable opening to Walsingham's contemporary history beginning in 1376, which Thompson skilfully reconstructed from the Harley manuscript itself and from two other sources  (BL, Cotton MS Otho. C.ii, and Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 316). The <span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, edited by H. T. Riley, contains the best available printed text of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> from 1377 to 1392. Although printed not from BL, Royal MS 13 E.ix, but from a late transcript  (Coll. Arms, Arundel MS 7), it preserves for the years 1377&#150;82 a more fully revised text than that found in the Harley manuscript. Despite his reliance on the Arundel transcript, Riley was fully aware of the value of the Royal manuscript, and in an appendix to volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>  (pp. 360&#150;410) printed passages from the Royal manuscript that had been omitted in the Arundel text. The concluding section of Walsingham's <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, which was not included in the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> publications, was printed in 1937 by V. H. Galbraith as the <span class="italic">St Albans Chronicle, 1406&#150;1420</span>. Work on a new edition of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, to be published in the <span class="roman">Oxford Medieval Texts</span> series, is now in progress.<br>
