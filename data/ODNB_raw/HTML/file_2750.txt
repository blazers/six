<span class="headword">Buckland <span class="st"> [Bocland]</span>,  Hugh  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1116<span class="mult">x</span>19), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was sheriff of Berkshire and several other counties. He took his name from the manor of Buckland, near Faringdon, of which he was tenant under the monastery of Abingdon. Before the death of William Rufus he was already sheriff of Berkshire, Hertfordshire, and also possibly Bedfordshire. He is stated in the Abingdon history to have been one of the people who profited by the unjust transactions of Modbert, whom the king had appointed to administer the affairs of the monastery in the interest of the royal revenues, during the period when the office of abbot was vacant. A grant of 3 hides at Hanney was made to Buckland because he was sheriff of Berkshire and a royal justice. He was ordered by Henry I to restore to the abbey the possessions that he had in this manner wrongfully obtained. Notwithstanding this, the Abingdon historian gives him a high character for uprightness and wisdom. The same authority states that he was held in great esteem by Henry I, and that in 1110 he was sheriff of eight counties. The evidence of charters enables us to identify six of these, namely, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Essex, and London and Middlesex. Buckland was an addressee of the copy of Henry I's coronation charter that was sent to Hertfordshire. He held 10 hides at Buckland from the abbey of Abingdon for one knight's service, 1 hide from Richard of Winchester, perhaps at Missenden, and land at Ludgate from Roger of Salisbury. In 1102 Henry I granted him warren in his land of Kensworth, Hertfordshire. He may have been a canon of St Paul's, holding the prebend of Harlesden.<br>
<br>The date of Buckland's death is uncertain; he witnessed a royal charter on 28 December 1115, but a charter of the queen in 1116 or 1117 refers to him as if he had died shortly before. The Abingdon history says that William de Bochelande, presumably a son of Hugh, was sheriff of Berkshire in 1119, so it can be inferred that Hugh of Buckland was certainly dead by then.<br>
<br>Another Hugh of Buckland, who may have been a grandson of the subject of this article, was sheriff of Berkshire from 1170 to 1176, and was one of the itinerant justices in 1173 and 1174. In 1166 he held one knight's fee in chief, another from Abingdon, and Faringdon at farm.<br>
