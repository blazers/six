<span class="headword">Tofts,  Catherine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1756), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was the daughter of Andrew Tofts (<i>d</i>. 1704), who was in the employ of Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, before he joined the royal household at St James's Palace in July 1702. Catherine Tofts &#145;took her first Grounds of Musick here in her own Country&#146;  (Cibber, 226), and may well have studied singing with Nicola Matteis the younger. She first sang in public in a series of subscription concerts at Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields theatres between 30 November 1703 and 14 March 1704, missing a concert on 14 December because of &#145;a great Cold&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 21 Dec 1703). On each occasion she sang several songs in Italian and English and on 18 January she was also advertised as singing Pallas in John Weldon's <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>. A songsheet of &#145;Fly swift ye hours&#146; by Henry Purcell was published as &#145;Sung by Mrs. Tofts in the Subscription Musick&#146;. (At this time the title &#145;Mrs&#146; does not indicate that she was married.) On 8 February 1704 a letter from Mrs Tofts was printed in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, expressing surprise and annoyance that her former servant, Ann Barwick, had &#145;committed a Rudeness last night at the Play-house, by throwing of Oranges, and hissing when Mrs. l'Epine the Italian Gentlewoman Sung&#146;. The two singers were supported by different political factions, the whigs favouring &#145;British Tofts&#146;, and the tories &#145;fam'd L'Epine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diverting Post</span>, 9&#150;16 June 1705), but there is no evidence of personal animosity between them.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1705 at Drury Lane, Mrs Tofts took the title role in the first English opera in the Italian style, Thomas Clayton's <span class="italic">Arsinoe</span>, and a year later in the even more successful <span class="italic">Camilla</span> (Bononcini, arranged by Haym), the part with which she became identified. On 4 March 1707 she sang in Clayton's <span class="italic">Rosamond</span>, which had a libretto by Joseph Addison, and on 1 April in <span class="italic">Thomyris</span> (pasticcio, arranged by Pepusch). The arrival of the castrato Valentini led to opera performances in a mixture of Italian and English. Mrs Tofts had leading roles in <span class="italic">Love's Triumph</span> (26 February 1708), <span class="italic">Pyrrhus and Demetrius</span> (14 December 1708), and <span class="italic">Clotilda</span> (2 March 1709). The actor Colley Cibber never forgot &#145;the Beauty of her fine proportion'd Figure, and the exquisitely sweet, silver Tone of her Voice, with that peculiar, rapid Swiftness of her Throat&#146;  (Cibber, 226). She earned a reputation for avarice and pride and was repeatedly involved in disputes over pay, costume, and conditions. In March 1709 Charles Dering wrote that her benefit would raise &#145;a vast deal&#146; and that she had been selling kisses at a guinea a time at the duke of Somerset's, where &#145;some took three, others four, others five kisses&#146;  (Milhous and Hume, <span class="italic">Register</span>, 437). Then on 26 May <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> reported &#145;the Distresses of the unfortunate <i>Camilla</i>, who has had the ill Luck to break before her Voice, and to disappear at a Time when her Beauty was in the Heigth of its Bloom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, 26 May 1709). This report does not indicate a breakdown in the modern sense, but that her extravagant lifestyle had led to serious debts and the need to leave London to escape her creditors. The opera company became completely dominated by Italian singers, so there was no place for her there. In July 1711 Anthony Hammond encountered her in the Netherlands <i>en route</i> for Hanover and by December she was in Venice. The following April the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> reported that she was much applauded there for her singing in grand private concerts. In September 1716 Alexander Cunningham wrote from Venice: &#145;As for Mr Smith he is soe much in Love wt Mrs Tofts, that he is fitt for nothing at present&#146;  (Levey, 352). This was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25871/', "Joseph Smith (1673/4?&#150;1770)")</script>, a successful businessman and later British consul in Venice who was to become a patron of Canaletto and a collector of fine books and paintings, many of which are now in the Royal Collection. The date of his marriage to Catherine Tofts is unknown, but she was travelling under the name of Smith when Hammond met her in 1711. The Smiths lived in style in the Palazzo Balbi&#151;now the Palazzo Mangilli-Valmarana&#151;on the Grand Canal and a villa at Mogliano. It is likely that they had a son, since there is a memorial tablet for John Smith (1721&#150;1727) in the church of Santi Apostoli near their palazzo. She died early in 1756 and her husband erected a fine memorial to her in the protestant cemetery on the Lido that is now to be seen in the extension to the Cimitero San Nicol&ograve;.<br>
