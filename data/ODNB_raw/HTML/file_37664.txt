<span class="headword">Lehmann,  Rudolph Chambers</span>  (1856&#150;1929), <span class="occ">journalist and oarsman</span>, was born in Ecclesall, Sheffield, on 3 January 1856, the eldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of Frederick Lehmann, businessman, and his wife Nina, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5079/', "Robert Chambers (1802&#150;1871)")</script>, the Edinburgh publisher. The artist Rudolf Lehmann (1819&#150;1905) was his great-uncle. He was educated at Highgate School and Trinity College, Cambridge, taking a second class in the classical tripos (1878). He was president of the union (1876), a noted boxer, captain of first Trinity boat club, and twice rowed in the university trial eights. On coming down he was called to the bar in 1880 (Inner Temple) but soon abandoned legal practice. An ample private income allowed him time to indulge his tastes for writing, politics, and rowing.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Lehmann had founded <span class="italic">Granta</span>, which he continued to edit for some years after leaving university. Much of his prose and verse, light-hearted in nature but containing some good pieces on rowing, appeared in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, of whose table he was a member for thirty years from 1890. Less happy were his efforts during the late 1890s to revive <span class="italic">The Speaker</span> as an organ for radical ideas, and his editorship of the ailing <span class="italic">Daily News</span> from 1901 to 1902. He did not find the day-to-day life of a professional journalist congenial.<br>
<br>A public-spirited man, Lehmann was high sheriff of Buckinghamshire during 1901&#150;2 and he was long active in the affairs of the National Liberal Federation. He unsuccessfully contested parliamentary seats in Cheltenham in 1885, Central Hull in 1886, and Cambridge town in 1892 before being elected in 1906 for the Harborough division of Leicestershire. He had opposed the South African War, and South African issues were one of his major concerns as an MP. He retained his seat in January 1910 but declined to stand again the following December. Deteriorating health and financial worries, following careless judgements by his stockbroker in 1907, contributed to this decision. His name was on the list of H. H. Asquith, had the prime minister been forced to create new Liberal peers in 1911.<br>
<br>Sport, more especially rowing, was his constant pleasure. An inspiring coach, he was in considerable demand by both Oxford and Cambridge for their boat race crews throughout the 1890s. He captained Leander in 1894 and 1895 and was elected a steward of Henley royal regatta in 1898. Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association from 1893 to 1901, he tried unsuccessfully to widen its narrow definition of an amateur. He coached abroad on a number of occasions, always refusing any kind of payment, even for his expenses, and his three visits to Harvard between 1896 and 1898 were rewarded by an honorary degree. Nevertheless he was suspicious of international competition, especially the Olympic movement, fearing it would turn what was intended to be pleasure into too serious a business.<br>
<br>Talented but without driving ambition, Lehmann was during his last years handicapped by Parkinson's disease. But his gift of friendship remained, reinforced by his marriage in 1898 to Alice Marie (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of Harrison Davis, of old New England puritan stock. Of their four children (one son and three daughters), three subsequently distinguished themselves&#151;Beatrix as an actress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39838/', "(Rudolph) John Lehmann (1907&#150;1987)")</script> as a man of letters, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39839/', "Rosamond Nina Lehmann (1901&#150;1990)")</script> as a novelist. Lehmann died on 22 January 1929 at Fieldhead, the house he had built at Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.<br>
