<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spicer <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Pearse]</span>,  Dorothy Norman</span>  (1908&#150;1946), <span class="occ">aviator and aeronautical engineer</span>, was born on 31 July 1908 at Hadley Wood, Middlesex, the only daughter of Norman Spicer (<i>d</i>. 1936), a stockbroker, and his wife, Hilda Mary Sisterson. She was educated at the Godolphin School in Brussels and at University College, London, before learning to fly in 1929 at the London Aeroplane Club, Stag Lane. During her flying training she met Pauline Gower who was there to study for her &#145;B&#146; (commercial) pilot's licence. They became great friends and decided that as soon as they had finished training they would form a business partnership.<br>
<br>In July 1931 Dorothy Spicer and Pauline Gower went to work; Pauline was licensed to carry passengers for &#145;hire or reward&#146;, and Dorothy qualified as a ground engineer (only the second woman in the world to do so) and the holder of an &#145;A&#146; (private) pilot's licence. They started with a hired Gipsy Moth but soon had a plane of their own. However, times were not easy and often they had barely enough money to buy food. Dorothy and her partner were determined to prove that it was possible for an aeronautical business run entirely by women to succeed, despite the severe economic depression.<br>
<br>With the idea of increasing their income Dorothy and Pauline decided to join the Crimson Fleet air circus and later the British hospitals' air pageant. The work was hectic, as in common with traditional circuses they were constantly on the move. While the pilots flew the planes the engineers were extremely busy maintaining them, doing running repairs, helping passengers into the aircraft, collecting the money, and organizing the queues. During this period Dorothy gained valuable experience especially as she had to strip down, repair, and rebuild the Spartan's engine on several occasions. Her skills became so well known that she was much sought after as a speaker and contributor to various aeronautical publications. She decided to add to her qualifications and to study for the &#145;B&#146; engineer's licence. As a woman it was very difficult to acquire this type of training because institutions offering advanced courses were restricted to men. However, she persuaded the manufacturers of their Spartan plane to allow her to obtain the necessary practical and theoretical training at their workshops and thus earned her &#145;B&#146; licence, becoming the first woman in the world to do so. Rather than return to touring Dorothy and Pauline decided to provide joyrides and aerial taxi trips from the holiday town of Hunstanton, Norfolk, where the constantly changing population would provide regular customers. Their business was going well so they decided to list it as a commercial company, thus giving birth to the first registered aeronautical company staffed and owned by women.<br>
<br>By early 1935 Dorothy Spicer was again keen to add to her impressive list of qualifications. Already she was the only woman in the world to hold &#145;A&#146; and &#145;B&#146; licences and a recently acquired &#145;C&#146; engineering licence. The goal this time was a &#145;D&#146; licence. At the time it was not possible for a woman to study at such an advanced level and it became so only when Air Vice-Marshal A. E. Borton persuaded Sir Harold Snagge, the chairman of the Napier Engineering Company Ltd, to make special arrangements. Six months later she won an award not possessed by any other woman and became authorized to inspect, pass out, and repair both engines and airframes. She was in fact qualified to build all aspects of an aircraft, airframe, and engine from scratch, and to approve the materials required for the work. It was an extraordinary achievement for anyone, let alone someone who had literally so many &#145;man-made&#146; barriers to overcome.<br>
<br>After two very successful years at Hunstanton, Dorothy and Pauline opted to accept an invitation from Tom Campbell Black to tour with his British empire air display with Dorothy as senior engineer and Pauline the chief pilot. While on tour Dorothy learned that her father had died from injuries sustained from a bad fall, and later in the year Pauline's mother also died. As both wanted to be more available to support their surviving parents they established an aerial garage on Hayling Island where pilots could bring their aircraft for service and repair. However, the work was not satisfying and the business was wound up. The final task was to write an account of their flying days together, <span class="italic">Women with Wings</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Dorothy Spicer was well known and admired in the aviation world, so when it became known that she was available she was offered several jobs. She finally accepted a position with the Air Registration Board in London, thereby becoming the first woman in the British empire to receive a technical appointment in civil aviation. On 2 March 1938 she became engaged to Flight Lieutenant Richard Pearse (<i>d</i>. 1946). They were married on 26 April 1938 at Holy Trinity, Brompton, with Pauline Gower as chief bridesmaid. The Pearses' only child, Patricia Mary, was born at Farnham Common, Surrey, on 15 May 1939.<br>
<br>War broke out just months after the baby's birth. Richard first served in Coastal Command but was soon appointed as a test pilot to the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough. In late 1940 Dorothy joined him, took on flying work as an air observer and research assistant, and became involved in the development of a variety of new aircraft types and items of equipment. After the war Richard accepted the job of South American representative of British Aviation Services Ltd in Rio de Janeiro. In December 1946 they left their daughter with family and flew out as passengers in a British-built Avro York of the Argentinian airline Flota Aerea Mercante Argentina. The trip was uneventful until bad weather forced the plane to be diverted from a scheduled landing at Rio de Janeiro. On 23 December, ten miles from the airport, in thick fog, the plane flew into a mountainside, killing all on board. A memorial service for Dorothy and Richard Pearse was held at All Saints' Church, St John's Wood, London, on 8 January 1947.<br>
