<span class="headword">Finlason,  William Francis</span>  (1818&#150;1895), <span class="occ">legal writer and journalist</span>, was the son of Thomas Finlason of Camberwell, Surrey. He entered the Middle Temple as a student on 5 January 1841. He practised for some years as a special pleader under the bar, and reported as a member of the <span class="italic">Times</span> parliamentary corps in the gallery of the House of Commons. He was called to the bar on 21 November 1851, and joined the south-eastern circuit. Although well versed in case law, he was not keen on practice, and turned instead to journalism and treatise writing. Having been converted to Roman Catholicism by Frederick William Faber in 1849, he became a regular contributor in the early 1850s to <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>; later in that decade he also wrote numerous legal and historical articles for the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, vigorously defending Catholic positions and attacking the views of whig historians. In 1852 he published his <span class="italic">Report of the trial and preliminary proceedings in the case of the Queen on the prosecution of G. Achilli v. Dr Newman</span>, in which he defended Newman and criticized the anti-Catholic attitude of the presiding judge, Lord Campbell.<br>
<br>Finlason wrote widely on legal subjects. For nearly half a century, he was the chief legal reporter for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, reporting nearly all the major cases in the queen's bench, albeit sometimes in a manner too florid for the liking of the legal profession. In the aftermath of the suppression by Governor Eyre of the Jamaican insurrection, he wrote a number of treatises on martial law, which put forward the view that at times of insurrection the crown had powers under the prerogative to use military force to suppress what he saw as a state of war. Finlason also brought out an edition of John Reeves's <span class="italic">History of English Law</span> in 1869. It was not a job well done, however: contradicting many of Reeves's arguments, Finlason sought to argue that all of the important institutions of the common law were derived from the period of the Roman occupation of Britain, but in doing so he revealed both a lack of historical sense and an approach to the sources which had little intellectual vigour. In 1870 he wrote a <span class="italic">History of the Law of Tenures of Land in England and Ireland</span>, which was read by Gladstone before he introduced the <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> in 1870. Finlason produced a number of other legal works, including a set of <i>nisi prius</i> reports (with T. C. Foster) between 1858 and 1865, and some commentaries on the common law procedure acts of 1852, 1854, and 1860. In addition, he was a frequent contributor to legal periodicals and edited one number of the <span class="italic">Law Magazine and Law Review</span> in 1874. Although only a stuff-gown barrister, on 10 May 1887 he was appointed one of the masters of the bench of the Middle Temple. He died on 11 March 1895 at his residence, 12 Campden Hill Road, Kensington, London, leaving a widow, Harriet.<br>
