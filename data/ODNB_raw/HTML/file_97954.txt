<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peacock, Sir  Robert</span>  (1859&#150;1926), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at Hutts, Ryal, Northumberland, on 30 April 1859, the third son in the family of at least six sons and three daughters of William Peacock (<i>b</i>. 1829/30), miner, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greagley (<i>b</i>. 1832/3). The family moved to Batley in Yorkshire and he was at work by the age of twelve. In 1878 he joined the Bradford police force as a constable, at that time not a job with many prospects. During the Fenian disturbances he displayed the calm assurance and courage that characterized his career, earning him promotion to acting sergeant in 1881. On 14 February 1882 he married, at Bradford register office, Betsy Scarr Lucas (1847/8&#150;1904), a grocer. Later that year he moved to the Rotherham police force as sergeant. While he was making undercover observations during unruly parliamentary elections in 1886 his report on a riot implicated one local politician and angered another. Rather than withdraw his report he resigned with his good character intact. He briefly ran a pie business in Sheffield, but was drawn back to policing.<br>
<br>Police forces wanted officers of Peacock's talent and integrity, and in 1887 he was recruited to the force in Bacup, Lancashire, with the rank of inspector. In 1888, just ten years after first becoming a policeman, he became chief constable of the Canterbury borough constabulary in Kent. In 1892 he moved back north as chief constable at Oldham, Lancashire, where he made the force &#145;one of the smartest in the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 19 Nov 1926). He instituted an eight-hour day, founded a recreation club, and led the St John Ambulance Association. His force dealt proficiently with four big strikes in local industries and shut down bogus clubs selling illegal alcohol and running gambling. At both Canterbury and Oldham he conducted police prosecutions in magistrates' courts, and at Oldham he was also chief officer of the fire brigade and chief inspector of weights and measures.<br>
<br>Peacock's success attracted the attention of the watch committee of the Manchester corporation, whose force was shattered by scandal. From 1882 to 1896 a superintendent, William Bannister, owned brothels in his division and protected them from prosecution with help from two sergeants. A public inquiry into the Manchester police was set up by the Home Office and reported in July 1897, leading to the resignation in January 1898, on health grounds, of the chief constable of Manchester, Charles Malcolm Wood. In March 1898 Peacock was appointed his successor, at a salary of &pound;800 a year, his candidature having been supported by testimonials ranging from the high sheriff of Lancashire to the MPs for Oldham and Canterbury and several clergyman. Before the First World War chief constables of such large boroughs as Manchester were, like their county equivalents, recruited from the military, colonial, or Indian police or the Royal Irish Constabulary; Peacock was unusual in having served in provincial constabularies in England, and could justifiably claim that &#145;few men could boast at his age of having had a more varied and complete experience of the duties of a police officer, from the ranks to the office of Chief Constable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 25 March 1898).<br>
<br>Peacock approached the challenge of restoring the force's morale and regaining public confidence in it by combining strict discipline with approachability. Much as in Oldham, he improved work conditions, for instance introducing regular breaks for meals so men could eat at stations. By 1900 his strategy was paying off, and one of his men declared, &#145;No one is more eager to see a P.C., on any subject whatever, than Mr. Peacock is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 9 Feb 1900). As one example of his style, during a strike in 1911 he personally walked the rounds and discovered that many officers had been on duty for over twelve hours. He immediately told his superintendents that only in exceptional circumstances should men serve such long hours, and got the practice stopped. Peacock made a fair disciplinary system a top priority. Even though he was strict, penalties for defaults were more moderate than in many forces. A constable charged with gossiping might be fined half a crown, half the fine in Liverpool. Having started on the beat, Peacock understood the problems and resentments caused by fines that seemed out of proportion to offences. On the other hand he was a stickler for punctuality and set up a scale of fines for lateness, sixpence for every thirty minutes.<br>
<br>Peacock understood that it was not fair to discipline men who had never learned their jobs properly. He set up classes through the Manchester school board in 1900 and put together a booklet of lectures on police duties for the first course. This was printed and distributed to other forces as <span class="italic">Powers and Responsibilities of the Police in relation to the Betting, Gaming, Highway, and Licensing Laws</span> (1900), bearing on its cover the simpler title <span class="italic">Police Constables' Duties</span>. The Manchester force's first instruction book, with conditions of service, standing orders, and local statutes, was issued in 1908 under Peacock's guidance.<br>
<br>While a condition of Peacock's appointment prevented him from investigating the past conduct of his force's members, men who had thrived under the corrupt Superintendent Bannister grumbled under Peacock and left the force. Two magistrates accustomed to using influence to protect friends discovered in 1901 that Peacock had thwarted their plans, and they resigned from the bench. His most vocal opponent was the city councillor Ross Clyne, who was upset at Peacock's mostly successful efforts to make the force more autonomous from the watch committee. In 1905 Clyne accused Peacock of scandalous allegations including keeping a &#145;reserve of harlots&#146;, practising &#145;systematic burglary&#146;, robbing prisoners, and gambling. Not only was Peacock vindicated, but citizens presented him with an illuminated address, and donated funds to cover his legal expenses  (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 7 April 1905). In recognition of his having &#145;shown special ability in the organization and control&#146; of the Manchester force he was awarded the king's police medal in January 1912.<br>
<br>Peacock's wider interests included child protection and the prevention of juvenile crime; the employment of children in street trading was a particular concern, and he read a paper on the subject to the International Congress for the Protection of Children in 1902. In the early twentieth century he frequently gave evidence to parliamentary inquiries on such matters as Sunday trading, obscene publications, vagrancy, and betting. In 1910, as president of the Association of Chief Constables of City and Borough Police Forces, he gave evidence to the royal commission on divorce, based on his experience of enforcing separation and maintenance orders.<br>
<br>In 1918 Peacock's prompt and intelligent action kept the Manchester police calm during the London police strike for better pay. In 1919 he was knighted in recognition of his long service to the police. He continued improving the Manchester city police, updating the instruction book, which remained in use for decades, in 1923. He included a history of policing and his policing philosophy:<blockquote>the Police Force to-day represents the disciplined organisation of the civil power, entrusted not only with the prevention and detection of offences, but with the carrying into effect of laws and regulations for the maintenance of public health, order, and safety. (<span class="italic">Police Instruction Book</span>, 1923)</blockquote>He was credited with maintaining normal police methods when policing Manchester during the general strike in May 1926.<br>
<br>Off duty Peacock lived simply. He enjoyed playing golf, and &#145;could be the life and soul of a social party, dancing with vigour and with huge enjoyment, and joining in mirthful games with a sort of boyish enthusiasm&#146; (Hewitt, 119, quoting the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>). He was a member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church at Rusholme. In October 1926 he gave a wireless address during civic week on the history of the Manchester police force. Soon afterwards he caught pneumonia, and died in a nursing home at Victoria Park, Manchester, on 18 November 1926. He was buried in the southern cemetery, Manchester, next to his wife.<br>
<br>One of the first nationally significant chief constables to have been promoted from the ranks, Peacock was also among the earliest to rise from humble origins to such a position in the police service. He helped create a model for a new kind of chief policeman, a career police officer who had walked a beat and could bring that experience to the administration of his force. His <span class="italic">Police Constables' Duties</span> became a standard throughout England. Such was his influence that contemporaries spoke of the &#145;Peacock tradition&#146; of policing:<blockquote>that has peculiarly distinguished the Manchester Force among the Police of the country. To define it is difficult, but its outstanding result is that in no other city in the country is there less sense of detachment between the Police and general public.  (<span class="italic">Police Review</span>, 11 March 1927)</blockquote>.<br>
