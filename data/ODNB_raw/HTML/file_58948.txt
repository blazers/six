<span class="headword">Acton,  Marion Jean Catherine <span class="st"> [Jeanie]</span>  Adams-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jeanie Hering]</span>  (1846&#150;1928), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born Marion Hamilton on 21 June 1846, in Brodick, Isle of Arran, Scotland, the daughter of Edith Hamilton and an unidentified Scottish nobleman. Before the age of four she was adopted by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13077/', "George Edwards Hering (1805&#150;1879)")</script>, a landscape painter born in London of a German baronial family, and his wife, Catherine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bromley), an artist. Her mother agreed to the adoption because it afforded her daughter better material and social circumstances. Henceforth known as Jeanie Hering, she moved to London and resided in St John's Wood, which was noted for its artistic community. She attended a day school in Finchley Road, London, from the age of six and finished her education with two years at school in M&uuml;nster, Westphalia, Germany, between 1862 and 1864.<br>
<br>Having modelled for many painters of the St John's Wood school and joined in the group's amateur performances, Hering initially wanted to become an actress, but her adoptive parents disapproved of the theatre as a career. She turned to writing, and four years after leaving school published <span class="italic">Garry, a Holiday Story</span> (1868), a novel about a girl and her dog on holiday. A succession of other children's books followed, often drawing heavily on her own experiences: <span class="italic">Golden Days</span> (1873) tells of life at a girls' boarding-school in Germany; <span class="italic">Through the Mist</span> (1874) narrates the romances of twin young women from Brodick, where the Herings had a summer home; <span class="italic">Elf</span> (1887) describes the early childhood of a Scottish girl. A clear moral or religious lesson distinguishes many of her stories, among them <span class="italic">Truth will Out</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">Honour is my Guide</span> (1886). She published over a dozen commercially successful novels between 1868 and 1894, many with George Routledge &amp; Sons, a leading children's book publisher of the period, and she also wrote picture books, magazine stories, and plays.<br>
<br>In 1874 Hering met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30337/', "John Adams-Acton (1830&#150;1910)")</script>, a prizewinning sculptor, and they married on 15 April 1875 at St Mark's Church, Hamilton Terrace, London. After visiting India for eight months, they settled in St John's Wood and spent summers at the family home in Brodick. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Through commissions and artistic friendships, Adams-Acton, as she became known, and her husband met many famous figures of the time, including William Gladstone, George Eliot, Robert Browning, and Cardinal Manning, and she became a noted hostess. Known also for her independent and sometimes impetuous personality, in 1887 she walked from London to Brodick&#151;a seven-week 500 mile journey&#151;with two nursemaids and her children, one of whom was pushed the entire way in a perambulator. A spirit of adventure, and perhaps a desire to gather raw material for her stories, inspired this journey to her birthplace. She had already written stories about the travels of perambulators, and she published her account of this journey as <span class="italic">The Adventures of a Perambulator</span> in 1894. She was fascinated by spiritualism and the occult, and she often consulted astrologers, attended s&eacute;ances, and collected folk stories. In later life she began to write and dictate her reminiscences, though only sporadically. From these fragments A. M. W. Stirling created a posthumous memoir combining Adams-Acton's own words with third-person narrative, which was published as <span class="italic">Victorian Sidelights</span> in 1954. Adams-Acton died on 10 October 1928 at her home, 99 Clifton Hill, St John's Wood, Middlesex, and was buried in Brodick.<br>
