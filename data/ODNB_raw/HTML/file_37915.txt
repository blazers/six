<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ross,  Robert Baldwin</span>  (1869&#150;1918), <span class="occ">journalist and gallery owner</span>, was born in Tours, France, on 25 May 1869, the youngest of seven children of John Ross (1818&#150;1871), attorney-general of Upper Canada, and his second wife, Augusta Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1905), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1168/', "Robert Baldwin (1804&#150;1858)")</script>, a former prime minister of Upper Canada. His father was of Irish descent; his mother was Canadian. After the death of his father, his mother took Ross and his siblings to London in accordance with his late father's wishes. Illness marred much of Ross's early life and he was educated by a private tutor. He went to King's College, Cambridge, in 1888 to read history, but, apart from writing for <span class="italic">The Gadfly</span> and <span class="italic">Granta</span>, his academic career was undistinguished. On leaving Cambridge at the end of his first year, he went to Edinburgh as a trainee journalist on the <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span>, then under the editorship of W. E. Henley.<br>
<br>In 1886 Ross became acquainted with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29400/', "Oscar Wilde")</script>. Frank Harris later made the scurrilous and uncorroborated suggestion that the two men had met in a public lavatory, but it is much more likely that Alex Ross, Robert's elder brother and a literary critic, made the introduction, possibly at the Savile Club: Alex Ross was a member of the Savile, and Wilde dined there occasionally. The friendship developed slowly, but in 1895, when Wilde was sentenced to two years' hard labour for homosexual crimes, Robert Ross was his most constant and loyal friend. After Wilde's release in 1897 and during his exile in France, Ross continued to befriend and support him, and to act as intermediary between Wilde and his estranged wife and her advisers. Ross was with Wilde when he died in Paris on 30 November 1900. Before his release from Reading gaol, Wilde had appointed Ross his literary executor; but, with Wilde's estate bankrupt, it was not until 1905 that Ross was able to pay Wilde's creditors and annul the bankruptcy. In 1905 Ross published <span class="italic">De Profundis</span>, an abridged version of Wilde's tormented prison letter to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32869/', "Lord Alfred Douglas")</script>. In 1908 Ross published, in fourteen volumes, <span class="italic">The Collected Works of Oscar Wilde</span>.<br>
<br>From 1901 to 1909 Ross was director and administrator of the Carfax Gallery, a small avant-garde art gallery in Ryder Street, London, which, under his direction, gained a reputation for showing the work of unknown artists. Between 1908 and 1912 Ross was art critic on the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. He held very firm opinions on the role of a critic, believing that it was his function to stimulate intelligent interest in paintings and to equip viewers to make their own independent judgements. He was never afraid to praise or damn: his love of the French impressionists was combined with trenchant criticism of post-impressionism. At the opening of the Post-Impressionist Exhibition of 1910 he blithely dismissed Cezanne as a failure. Ross joined the National Art Collections Fund and was elected to the executive committee in 1912; he also became a member of the Contemporary Art Society. In 1912 he was appointed London director of the new Johannesburg Art Gallery and was valuer of pictures and drawings for the Board of Inland Revenue from 1912 to 1914.<br>
<br>From 1913 to 1915 Ross was plagued by several exhausting litigations with Lord Alfred Douglas and the journalist T. W. H. Crosland. In 1915, however, Ross finally won a judgment against Crosland. D. S. MacColl, keeper of the Wallace Collection, and Sir Edmund Gosse, angered at the damage the court appearances had done to Ross's high reputation, organized a testimonial. Ross insisted that the money raised should be given to the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London, for a Robert Ross memorial prize. In 1917 he served as an additional trustee to the Tate Gallery, and as London buyer for the Felton bequest of the Melbourne Art Gallery.<br>
<br>During the years of the First World War Ross's London apartment became a sanctuary for war-weary young men, including the war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. In Ross's delightful and witty company, for a few precious hours, they could forget the horrors of trench warfare. Although these men were not among his partners, Ross was clearly homosexual and had two long-term relationships. He shared a house for fifteen years with (William) More Adey; a shorter partnership, with Frederick (Freddie) Stanley Smith, ended in 1917, when Smith took up a diplomatic appointment in Stockholm. Ross discouraged discussion of his sex life, and maintained a lifelong silence about the exact nature of his relationship with Wilde, deriving much satisfaction during his long legal battles with Douglas from the failure of lawyers and inquiry agents to find evidence of a liaison between himself and his famous friend.<br>
<br>Ross died suddenly on 5 October 1918 at his home, 40 Half Moon Street, Mayfair, London, but even then his delicate sense of humour did not desert him: he left instructions in his will that he was to be cremated&#151;a most unusual request for a Roman Catholic (he had converted in 1894)&#151;and his ashes taken to P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery in Paris and placed within Oscar Wilde's tomb. His family arranged his cremation, which took place at Golders Green, but his ashes were not taken to Paris until 30 November 1950, the fiftieth anniversary of Wilde's death.<br>
