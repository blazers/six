<span class="headword">Constable, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1590, <em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was baptized on 4 March 1590, the only son of Sir Robert Constable (<i>d</i>. 1600) of Flamborough and Holme, Yorkshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Hussey of Duffield in the same county. William belonged to an ancient Yorkshire family of several branches, and is often confused with an elder kinsman and namesake who was involved in Essex's plot of 1601. On 15 February 1608 he married Dorothy (<i>bap</i>. 1590, <i>d</i>. 1656), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9091/', "Sir Thomas Fairfax")</script> of Denton (later first Baron Fairfax of Cameron), but their union produced no surviving children. He was created a baronet on 29 June 1611.<br>
<br>Constable rose to prominence in the 1620s when he emerged as one of Yorkshire's leading figures in the &#145;country&#146; interest. He was an ally of Sir Thomas Wentworth (the future earl of Strafford) in his struggle with Sir John Savile, and in 1626 he successfully contested the county election against the Saviles after Wentworth had been pricked as sheriff. The following year he was summoned before the privy council and imprisoned as a loan refuser. In 1628 he was returned for Scarborough with the backing of his friend Edmund Sheffield, Lord Mulgrave. He and another friend, Sir Matthew Boynton, were made deputy lieutenants for the East Riding by Wentworth in 1629 after Sir John Hotham had recommended them as &#145;the ablest and best affected to do his Majesty service in respect of their undoubted affection in religion&#146;  (Hotham to Wentworth, 7 Jan 1629, Sheffield Central Library, Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments, Strafford Papers., 12(50)). Constable was summoned before the privy council again in 1630 for refusing to compound for distraint of knighthood.<br>
<br>Although a man of godly convictions, Constable led a spendthrift existence, and was forced to sell most of his estate&#151;worth over &pound;1000 a year&#151;to cover his debts. He parted with the manor of Holme in 1634 (to Sir Marmaduke Langdale for &pound;6500) and the manor of Flamborough two years later. It was probably his ailing fortunes as much as his dislike of Laudian &#145;new ceremonies&#146; that made him consider emigrating to America during Charles I's personal rule. In 1635 he and Boynton made secret preparations to settle in Connecticut, where Viscount Saye and Sele and Lord Brooke had obtained a grant of land, but the difficulties involved forced them to abandon the venture. In April 1637 Constable obtained a pass for himself and his wife to travel on the continent, and in June they crossed over to the Netherlands where they were joined by Boynton and his family. By 1640 they were leading members of the gathered church established at Arnhem by Philip Nye and Thomas Goodwin.<br>
<br>Constable had returned to England by March 1641, and with the support of his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9081/', "Ferdinando Fairfax, second Lord Fairfax")</script>, stood for election at Knaresborough in November, only to lose on a poll to one of the townsmen, William Dearlove. Constable petitioned the Commons against the result, and as the royalist interest (with which Dearlove was associated) dwindled at Westminster during 1642 so Constable's stock improved, until on 17 August his election was declared good. Despite his debts he raised a regiment of parliamentarian foot in 1642, which he commanded with distinction at Edgehill. In July 1643 he was given command of the forces of the East Riding under Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, and during the spring of 1644 he won a series of engagements against the royalists in Yorkshire. On 23 March 1645 the Commons acknowledged his &#145;faithful Services&#146; as well as his &#145;great Losses&#146; with a grant of &pound;1000  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 4, 1644&#150;6, 88). Deprived of his command by the self-denying ordinance, he became a mainstay of the northern association committee, and emerged as a minor figure in the Independent interest at Westminster. After Sir Thomas Fairfax (later third baron) wrote to the speaker in February 1647 commending his uncle's services to parliament, the Commons awarded Constable &pound;1984 for his arrears. He was among those MPs who fled to the army in August, and his loyalty to the Independents' cause was further rewarded in December, when he was given command of John Lambert's regiment of foot. The following month he was commissioned to assist Colonel Robert Hammond in guarding the king at Carisbrooke.<br>
<br>Constable was made governor of Gloucester in 1648, his regiment having been sent to the town to quell unrest. During November and December he played a leading role in the council of officers as it moved towards confrontation with parliament. He supported the army's remonstrance to the Commons of 20 November, and was a member of various committees for deciding army policy, including the joint committee of officers, Levellers, and radical MPs for drawing up the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. He may also have been one of the subcommittee to organize Pride's Purge. Appointed to the commission for trying the king, he attended the trial proceedings regularly and was a signatory to the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. In February 1649 he was elected to the first council of state, and he was subsequently a member of the second and fourth councils, serving twice as president of the latter. He was one of the more active councillors, attending over 400 meetings and sitting on numerous conciliar committees, mostly concerning military affairs. In May 1650 the Rump passed a bill for transferring Holme from the sequestered Sir Marmaduke Langdale back to Constable.<br>
<br>Constable was largely inactive in national politics after the dissolution of the Rump, though he was warmly recommended by the Gloucestershire Independent churches during canvassing for membership of the nominated assembly. He died on 15 June 1655, and despite requesting in his will to be buried &#145;without ostentation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Abstracts of Yorkshire Wills in the Time of the Commonwealth</span>, ed. W. J. Clay, Yorkshire Archaeological Society record ser. 9, 1890, 82), was given an elaborate state funeral and interred in Westminster Abbey on 21 June. At the Restoration his estate was confiscated and his remains were dug up and thrown into a common pit.<br>
