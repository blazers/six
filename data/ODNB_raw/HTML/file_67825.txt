<span class="headword">Pujol,  Juan Garcia</span>  (1912&#150;1988), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was born in Barcelona on 14 February 1912, the third child of Juan Pujol (<i>d</i>. 1931), a Catalan who owned a dye factory in Barcelona, and his wife, Mercedes Garcia. He was educated at the La Salle Brothers School, Barcelona, and the Royal School of Poultry. After compulsory military service, he was appointed manager of a chicken farm north of Barcelona. However, when the Spanish Civil War broke out Pujol was called up by the republicans as a reservist and, when he went into hiding, was listed as a deserter. He was arrested just before Christmas 1937 but managed to gain his release a week later, going straight back into hiding. Early the following year he managed a union farm in northern Catalonia until it failed, and he then joined an infantry battalion in the hope of deserting to the nationalists at the first opportunity. This he did, only to be imprisoned in northern Spain. There one of his father's friends, a priest, negotiated his release and he was commissioned in the nationalist army. By the time Madrid fell he had not fired a shot for either side, and had found a job managing the Hotel Majestic there.<br>
<br>When the Second World War started Pujol had developed a hatred of political extremism, and in January 1941 he volunteered his services to the British embassy. Abruptly rejected, he decided to enhance his value before making a second approach, and accordingly contacted the German military attach&eacute;, to whom he masqueraded as an enthusiastic fascist willing to work for the Nazis.<br>
<br>Pujol's apparent willingness to undertake a secret mission to England evidently impressed the Germans, who trained him in wireless techniques and in July 1941 dispatched him to Portugal, <i>en route</i> for London, with $3000. However, unable to obtain the necessary entry visa, Pujol started to manufacture reports for the <i>Abwehr</i>, and pretended that he had indeed succeeded in travelling to Britain. Once the Germans had accepted this ruse he visited the British embassy, only to be rebuffed for a second time. It was only after he had made another approach, this time to the Americans in February 1942, that an explanation was found for the mysterious messages from an elusive spy codenamed Arabel that had been intercepted by MI5. Security Service analysts had expressed considerable doubt about Arabel's veracity, his reports making bizarre claims for expenses and being full of patently untrue information.<br>
<br>When MI5 realized that Arabel was nothing more than an enthusiastic amateur agent who had successfully duped his <i>Abwehr</i> handler, the decision was taken to allow Pujol to come to London and operate under strict supervision. His assigned case officer was a brilliant half-Spanish artist, Tomas Harris, and together they were to form an astonishing partnership, inventing a completely notional network of twenty-six subagents, all of whom drew their expenses. MI5 were able to monitor the <i>Abwehr</i>'s growing admiration for their star agent, and when he correctly forecast the date of the allied invasion in Normandy, they rewarded him with an Iron Cross. However, Pujol, now codenamed Garbo by MI5 because he was considered such an inspired actor, had been authorized to tip off the enemy to the D-day landings, insisting that they were only a diversionary feint, the true assault being scheduled for the Pas-de-Calais a fortnight later. This key contribution to a carefully orchestrated deception campaign helped persuade the <i>Wehrmacht</i> high command not to launch an immediate counter-attack, while the troops were at their most vulnerable, thus ensuring D-day's success.<br>
<br>Pujol was made an MBE in September 1944, although the award was made in conditions of great secrecy by the director-general of the Security Service and the decoration was never officially gazetted. At the end of the war, the Germans never having discovered his true role as a double agent, he was given a new identity in Venezuela and worked as a language teacher for Shell oil. Eventually his wife tired of Maracaibo and returned to Madrid with their two children, and he remarried, fathering another two sons. Pujol died in Caracas, aged seventy-six, on 15 October 1988; he was undoubtedly the most successful double agent of the Second World War.<br>
