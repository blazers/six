<span class="headword">Rau, Sir Benegal Narsinga</span>  (1887&#150;1953), <span class="occ">judge and diplomatist</span>, was born at Karkala, near Mangalore, in the Madras presidency, south India, on 26 February 1887, second of the four sons of Benegal Raghavendra Rao, a doctor in the Madras medical service, and his wife, Radha Bai (1864/5&#150;1947). It was a remarkable family. Of his brothers, B. Sanjiva Rao became a distinguished educationist, B. Rama Rao a governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and B. Shiva Rao the Delhi correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and a member of India's parliament. Narsinga Rau was educated at Kanara high school, Mangalore, and Presidency College, Madras, where he graduated in 1905 with a triple first in English, physics, and Sanskrit. In 1906 he took up a government scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, and on graduating as ninth wrangler in 1909 turned down a Trinity fellowship in favour of the Indian Civil Service. He returned home in November 1910 to a post as an assistant magistrate in Bengal.<br>
<br>In 1920 Rau was transferred to Assam. A witty and engaging man, he was popular with his fellow officers, not least for his talent at the quintessentially British pastimes of bridge, tennis, billiards, and golf. In 1925 he was appointed secretary to the provincial legislative department and legal remembrancer, and in 1933 was dispatched to London to argue Assam's case before the joint select committee on India's constitutional reforms. He was appointed CIE in 1934 and in 1935 was offered a judgeship on the Calcutta high court, but opted instead for the more challenging, if less remunerative, post of draftsman in the law department of the government of India. In just eighteen months he revised India's vast body of central and provincial statutes to bring them into line with the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935, thus enabling the new constitution to take effect, as scheduled, in 1937. Meanwhile Sir Maurice Gwyer, the first chief justice of the federal court in New Delhi, was anxious to get Rau as a colleague, but to qualify Rau had first to serve at least five years as a High Court judge, so in December 1938 he finally took up a seat on the Calcutta high court. He had been knighted the previous June. Ironically, such was the government's demand for Rau's skills that he never completed his five-year apprenticeship. At the government's request, he chaired an inquiry into disputed wages and conditions at the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company, presided over a committee exploring the codification of Hindu law (1941), and headed the Indus waters commission (1942) charged with determining the equitable distribution of the Indus's liquid wealth among the provinces and states of western India.<br>
<br>In 1944, with the federal judgeship still beyond reach, Rau retired from the civil service and accepted the prime ministership of Kashmir, but the politics and intrigue of an Indian court were alien to the traditions of the civil service and, after eighteen difficult months, he resigned the post. The Calcutta high court beckoned again, but Rau let it be known that he wanted to share in the drafting of the laws for federation and the other big constitutional changes which lay ahead. In September 1945 Lord Wavell, who thought highly of his skills, set him to work in the reforms office on an Indo-British treaty to be implemented after independence.<br>
<br>In July 1946, with independence in sight but still of indistinct form, Rau was appointed constitutional adviser to the constituent assembly. It was an honorary appointment, taken on, he insisted, as &#145;a labour of love&#146;  (Rao, xxix). He was a popular choice. The leaders of the Indian National Congress respected his objectivity and silent patriotism, most recently in evidence when he had quietly assisted in the defence of the Indian National Army men who were tried for treason in 1945. But the leader of the Muslim League, M. A. Jinnah, was also friendly to Rau and valued his scrupulous constitutionalism. Amid India's plans for the future, Rau also found time to assist neighbouring Burma in drafting her constitution too.<br>
<br>After independence Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, was keen to make the most of the man whom he described as &#145;the perfect civil servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hindu</span>, 1 Dec 1953, 4) and in 1948 Rau was appointed a member of India's delegation to the United Nations general assembly. In 1950&#150;51 he represented India on the Security Council, and was president of the council in June 1950 when North Korea crossed the 38th parallel and the UN recommended intervention to help South Korea. He was the architect of the first Asian&#150;African bloc in the UN and, with his detailed knowledge of Kashmir, proved a worthy opponent of the Pakistanis. He was touted as a future secretary-general, but he was increasingly afflicted by stomach cancer. In December 1951 he was elected to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, but he was barely a year in the post when a recurrence of the cancer put him in a nursing home in Z&uuml;rich. He died there on 29 November 1953. He was cremated on 1 December and his ashes returned to India.<br>
<br>Rau was one of the outstanding members of the Indian Civil Service, whose integrity and legal acumen won worldwide recognition. He was a suave, immaculately dressed man, of small build with refined features crowned, in later years, with luxuriant silver hair. Friends and colleagues remembered him as an elegant, even precious speaker, an intensely private man whose courtesy disguised a resolute and hard-headed pragmatism. He never married. In 1960 his brother Shiva brought together some of the many constitutional schemes which he had drafted in a book entitled <span class="italic">India's Constitution in the Making</span>.<br>
