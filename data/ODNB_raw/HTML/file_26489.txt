<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, fourth earl of Atholl  (<em>d.</em> 1579), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son of <a name="cosubject_26489"></a><span class="headword">John Stewart</span>, third earl of Atholl  (1507&#150;1542)<span class="occ"></span>, and his first wife, Grizel (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1537), daughter of Sir John Rattray. Without being a leading figure either at court or in government, the third earl performed a number of useful services for James V. He served in the borders early in 1533, and probably accompanied the king both to France in 1536 and to the Orkneys and Hebrides in 1540. In the latter year he was a member of the assize which condemned Sir James Hamilton of Finnart. His most significant employment was in maintaining order in Perthshire, where he acted with a vigour that brought him into confrontation with his local rival, Sir Robert Menzies of that ilk. He lived in magnificent style, and according to Pitscottie spent &pound;1000 a day entertaining the king and the papal nuncio at a great hunting trip to Atholl in 1529. His first wife having died some time after 1537, he married in 1542 Jean or Janet, daughter of John, sixth Lord Forbes. The third earl died later that year, probably in Edinburgh, between 19 October and 9 November, while serving in the royal army.<br>
<br>The younger John Stewart married twice. By 26 May 1547 he had married Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11034/', "George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly")</script>, with whom he had two daughters (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69924/', "Elizabeth Stewart, Lady Lovat and later countess of Arran")</script>). She had died by 1 April 1557, when Atholl contracted to marry Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1587), widow successively of Robert, Lord Graham, and Thomas, master of Erskine, and daughter of Malcolm, third Lord Fleming. They had a son, John, later fifth earl of Atholl, and five daughters.<br>
<br>The guiding force in much of the fourth earl's career was his Catholicism. Atholl supported Mary of Guise in 1554 when she claimed the regency, and followed her again at the end of the decade in opposing the lords of the congregation. After the latter's triumph in 1560 he registered his disapproval by voting against acceptance of the protestant confession of faith. His political position was not always consistent, for he supported the attempts to negotiate the marriage of Queen Elizabeth to James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, but then, according to Knox, joined the earl of Huntly and other Catholics in an unsuccessful scheme to capture Edinburgh. On Queen Mary's return from France in 1561 Atholl was made a privy councillor, and he remained her staunch supporter at least until her marriage to Bothwell in 1567. In 1564 he seems to have tried to emulate his father by organizing a spectacular deer-hunt for Mary at Atholl. In 1565 he actively supported the queen when she seemed to be veering towards a distinctly pro-Catholic policy following the unsuccessful coup by the earl of Moray, the so-called chaseabout raid. On 23 August he was made lieutenant in the north, and on 10 October was named as leader of the rearguard in the force raised to suppress Moray's rising. The birth of Mary's son and heir, Prince James, on 19 June 1566 gave rise to superstitious rumours concerning Atholl's wife Margaret, who was said to possess the magical gift of incantation, enabling her to transfer Mary's discomfort in childbirth to a lady-in-waiting.<br>
<br>As with many of his fellow noblemen, political expediency also influenced Atholl's behaviour during these years. In 1562 his religious sympathies did not prevent his taking an active part in the campaign against the crypto-Catholic earl of Huntly, who had rebelled in protest against Mary's alleged favouritism towards her half-brother, the earl of Moray. About this time, moreover, Atholl seems to have rejected overtures from Huntly for the formation of a Roman Catholic alliance which would challenge the protestant ascendancy in Scotland. He was not involved in the plot against Riccio, and when the queen's secretary was murdered on the night of 9 March 1566 he attempted to escape from Holyrood Palace. He joined Mary at Dunbar shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Perhaps less surprisingly, the murder of Darnley and Mary's marriage to Bothwell in 1567 severely affected Atholl's relations with the queen, at least in the short term. Like many others who supported her, he was astonished and dismayed that she should choose to marry a highly unpopular nobleman who was widely believed to have been deeply involved in the murder of her late husband. He was reported to have discussed ways of avenging that murder with the earls of Moray and Morton, and was a leader of the force which confronted the queen at Carberry Hill on 15 June. On 29 June he attended the coronation of James VI at Stirling, where John Knox preached the sermon and James was anointed by Adam Bothwell, the protestant bishop of Orkney. He had been present a few days earlier when the casket letters were opened, and approved Mary's confinement at Lochleven.<br>
<br>Gradually, however, Atholl began to return to his former loyalty to Mary, and with a view to obtaining her restoration supported proposals in 1569 that she be divorced from Bothwell. In the civil war which broke out following Moray's assassination at Linlithgow on 23 January 1570, Atholl openly renewed his allegiance to Mary, as did the earls of Argyll, Huntly, and Hamilton. Initially their cause prospered as they won over other members of the nobility. Edinburgh was occupied on 13 April, but efforts to persuade the leaders of the king's party to hold a convention with them there failed, and eventually Atholl and his followers assembled at Linlithgow, while their opponents gathered in Edinburgh. In August Atholl played host to a large assembly of Mary's supporters, but the tide gradually turned against them and the queen's party began to disintegrate. By 1572, with the earl of Morton now the leading figure in Regent Mar's government, Atholl was supporting a lost cause. Much to his dismay Morton was elected regent in November 1572, and, although he did not sign the pacification of Perth in February 1573 when the Hamilton and Huntly families made their peace with the regency, Atholl made his submission not long afterwards at Edinburgh in April.<br>
<br>The five years between 1573 and 1578 constituted a largely uneventful period in Atholl's life, notable only for his religious dissidence and for a bitter feud which developed between him and the earl of Argyll. Atholl's preference for the old faith naturally offended the leaders of the kirk, and one of the principal reasons for the dismissal of James Paton, bishop of Dunkeld, in 1576 was his failure to execute a sentence of excommunication against the earl. The appointment of a team of ministers to offer constant spiritual guidance appears to have been a more effective stratagem, resulting in at least an outward religious conformity on Atholl's part.<br>
<br>Atholl's quarrel with Argyll was essentially a dispute over legal jurisdiction. Argyll initially raised the issue at a privy council meeting in February 1576 when he complained that Atholl was illegally exercising in his domains a commission of justiciary granted in the previous reign. Morton's administration struggled in vain to tackle this feud effectively, and for the next eighteen months Argyll, Atholl, and their belligerent followers attacked one another. The paradoxical outcome of the affair was that Atholl, convinced that Morton was not doing enough on his behalf, decided to settle his differences with Argyll on his own accord. On 22 October 1577 the two rivals signed a bond of friendship which not only ended their quarrel but marked the beginning of the alliance which ultimately brought Morton's regency to a close.<br>
<br>In the final years of his life Atholl enjoyed a brief return to his earlier prominence. He played a leading part in the overthrow of Morton early in March 1578, and on the 29th was appointed chancellor following the death of Lord Glamis. Then in July 1578, when the former regent attempted a comeback, Atholl and Argyll gathered a force at Edinburgh estimated at 7000 men and marched toward Stirling, where Morton had ordered parliament to assemble. They confronted the latter's forces on 12 August at Falkirk, where the English ambassador Robert Bowes and two Edinburgh ministers managed to negotiate a truce. Atholl was reported to have been reconciled with Morton, and his death at Kincardine Castle, on 24 April 1579, came a few days after he had attended a banquet given by the latter. He was buried in St Giles's Cathedral, Edinburgh, on 4 July. His family was convinced he had been poisoned and medical opinion largely agreed with this diagnosis. But Morton always vehemently denied any complicity in Atholl's death and one of his final statements on the scaffold on 2 June 1581 was to protest his innocence in this affair. Significantly, perhaps, Atholl had applied for a licence to leave the country in June 1578, giving ill health as the reason for his request. The effect of food poisoning on a weak constitution, rather than a deliberate criminal conspiracy, seems the likeliest explanation of his death, ending a quarter of a century of active involvement in Scottish affairs.<br>
