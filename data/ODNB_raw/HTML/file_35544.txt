<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Plucknett,  Theodore Frank Thomas</span>  (1897&#150;1965), <span class="occ">legal historian</span>, was born on 2 January 1897 in Bristol, the only son of Frank Plucknett, boot stock keeper, who became a shoemaking technologist and taught and wrote books on that subject, and of his wife, Caroline Thomas. Plucknett went from Alderman Newton's School, Leicester, to the Bacup and Rawtenstall School at Newchurch, Lancashire, working there for an external degree of London University and graduating with second class honours in history in 1915. His father then apparently moved to London to make it financially possible for him to become an internal student at University College; and before he was twenty-one he had gained not only his MA but also the Alexander prize of the Royal Historical Society, both for work on the fifteenth-century council.<br>
<br>In 1918 Plucknett went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, with a research exhibition, and under the supervision of H. D. Hazeltine wrote a thesis published as <span class="italic">Statutes and their Interpretation in the First Half of the Fourteenth Century</span> (1922). This began the conversion of Plucknett from a constitutional historian to a historian of private law; and the LLB degree which it gained in 1920, under regulations later superseded by those for the PhD, lent colour to the impression that he was a lawyer. In this conversion the decisive event was his nomination in 1921 to the Choate memorial fellowship, which took him to the Harvard law school where he was first a student, though doing only research and taking no courses, then from 1923 to 1926 instructor, and from 1926 to 1931 assistant professor.<br>
<br>Plucknett's appointment to the Harvard faculty was the doing of Roscoe Pound, with whom he edited a volume of readings on legal history; and his leaving Harvard for the London School of Economics seems to have been the doing of Harold Laski. The reputation which Plucknett had made by his Harvard courses, and partly also by his <span class="italic">Concise History of the Common Law</span> which was written by dictation in a matter of weeks and published in the United States in 1929, was that of a historian with a creed and a sense of style, both caught in his own later words: &#145;It is only in text-books that constitutional, economic and legal history are set apart from one another. In real life they are simultaneous, and one man lives all his histories concurrently&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Mediaeval Bailiff</span>, 1954, 2).<br>
<br>This was the reputation which brought Plucknett home in 1931 as first holder of the LSE's chair of legal history. He held it for the rest of his working life; but from his colleagues in the law faculty Plucknett became increasingly remote. He steadfastly denied that his subject was any use to lawyers: &#145;It is still too often said that English law can only be understood historically. Now English law may be bad, but is it really as bad as that?&#146;  (T. F. T. Plucknett, <span class="italic">Early English Legal Literature</span>, 1958, 17). His courses for law students were attended by the interested few, which to him was as it should be; and the remainder of his teaching and all of his professional discourse was directed to historians. His presidency of the Society of Public Teachers of Law in 1953&#150;4 seemed a pleasant incongruity, very different from his term as president of the Royal Historical Society from 1948 to 1952. Plucknett was elected FBA in 1946, fellow of University College, London, in 1950, honorary fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1952, and was awarded the honorary LLD of Glasgow (1958) and Birmingham (1963), and in 1959 an honorary LittD of Cambridge (a perceptive recognition of the pure historian). His last years were clouded by illness and he resigned prematurely in 1963. He died at home, 17 Crescent Road, Wimbledon, on 14 February 1965.<br>
<br>In Cambridge, Massachusetts, Plucknett met (Anne) Marie, daughter of Ferdinand Guibert; and in 1923 they were married at her home in Clermont-Ferrand, France. This became a second home where, unless prevented by war or illness, they spent part of every year; and there he was buried. Apart from these visits he was never long away from their Wimbledon house, next door to which their only son settled after his marriage. Outside his family Plucknett was solitary by habit, having few intimates, all historians; and even with them he kept in touch mainly on professional matters and by correspondence. Formal in speech and dress, amiable and absent in manner, he became elusive to casual enquirers. But to those with a claim on his time he was encouraging and helpful; and his professional life was conducted with a firmness and method unsuspected by most of his colleagues.<br>
<br>Apart from articles and contributions to books by others, Plucknett advanced his subject in two main ways. He was joint literary director of the Selden Society from 1937 and alone from 1946; and though he played a named part in few volumes, a substantial proportion of the society's publications and the continuation of the enterprise itself owed much to his faith in the value of such intractable materials. And then there are his own books. The <span class="italic">Concise History</span> went into five editions and several languages; and though increasingly daunting to students it remains an essential part of the literature. The other works grew out of special lectures. The Ford lectures in Oxford in 1947 became <span class="italic">Legislation of Edward I</span> (1949); the Maitland memorial lectures in Cambridge, commissioned for the centenary in 1950 of the birth of F. W. Maitland, became <span class="italic">Early English Legal Literature</span> (1958); his Creighton lecture of 1953 was published as <span class="italic">The Mediaeval Bailiff</span> (1954); and the Wiles lectures in Belfast in 1958 became <span class="italic">Edward I and Criminal Law</span> (1960).<br>
<br>The last work was written when Plucknett was failing; and though full of ideas, it lacks the realism and immediacy of his best work. If he underestimated the strength of legal logic, he never fell into the converse and more common error of connecting one abstraction only with another. The book on literature is about lawyers; the book on legislation is about social problems, themselves seen as real people in concrete situations. His lack of legal training probably helped as well as hindered, and perhaps his lack of historical training helped too; apart from the supervision of his graduate work, and some early help with documents from Hubert Hall, Plucknett had no instruction after his school days. It may turn out that sometimes he saw wrong, but he always saw for himself; and at least in that, and in the vividness and humour which that alone can generate, he was a true follower of Maitland.<br>
