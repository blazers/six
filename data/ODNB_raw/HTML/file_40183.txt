<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maclean,  Alistair Stuart</span>  (1922&#150;1987), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 21 April 1922 in Shettleston, Glasgow, the third of four sons (there were no daughters) of the Revd Alistair Maclean, Church of Scotland minister, of Glasgow and Daviot, Inverness-shire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Archie Lamont, warehouseman, of Possil Park, Glasgow. He spent the first fourteen years of his life in the highland districts of Daviot and Dunlichty, where his father was ministering. At home in the manse only Gaelic was spoken, a curious restriction when the father both wrote and delivered the English language with a fine eloquence and must have known that his children would require it later in life. Maclean was educated at Daviot School, Inverness Royal Academy, and Hillhead high school in Glasgow, and Glasgow University, from which he graduated MA in 1950. In 1983 he was awarded an honorary DLitt by Glasgow University. He served in the Royal Navy from 1941 to 1946, much of the time as a leading torpedo operator on HMS <i>Royalist</i>, on the notorious Russian convoys to Murmansk.<br>
<br>From 1946 until 1956 Maclean taught English, history, and geography at Gallowflat School, Rutherglen, Glasgow. After winning a short-story competition run by the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> he came to the attention of Ian Chapman, who worked at the Collins publishing house. Chapman persuaded him to write <span class="italic">HMS Ulysses</span>, which was published in October 1955. It was an instant best-seller, with 250,000 copies sold in the first six months. <span class="italic">HMS Ulysses</span> was a Book Society choice, as was <span class="italic">The Guns of Navarone</span> (1957); they were followed by <span class="italic">Ice Station Zebra</span> (1963). Maclean then left his native Scotland and became a tax exile in Switzerland. In his subsequent nomadic life, he moved back to England and then to the south of France, California, and Yugoslavia. During these years he completed a total of thirty-two books, of which twenty-six were novels; they brought him gross earnings of around &pound;20 million. Many of the books became films, notably <span class="italic">The Guns of Navarone</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Ice Station Zebra</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Where Eagles Dare</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">When Eight Bells Toll</span> (1971). The books were fast-moving thrillers, without great literary stature. Women rarely featured in them.<br>
<br>Maclean was of spare build and about 5 feet 7 inches tall. He had sleek dark hair, with a middle parting: he was not unattractive, but was not an imposing figure. He had a thick Scottish highland accent, which at times made him difficult to understand. He was highly intelligent, with a fascination for medical science in general and cancer research in particular. His life was greatly influenced by the early death of his brother, Lachlan, while a 21-year-old medical student at Glasgow University. He was a very complex character, full of inhibitions and strange moods, with a wry sense of humour which only appeared when he was relaxed in the company of friends. He was introverted and shy and, although his behaviour could be boorish, he was extremely generous, not only with his material possessions but in his willingness to encourage and help other writers in their careers. His charitable acts were never flamboyant or publicized.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1953 he married Gisela Heinrichsen, of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. They had two sons of their own and adopted a third. Whether it was because, as a very shy and guilt-ridden man, Maclean found his success difficult to cope with or because of a growing drink problem, his marriage latterly was unhappy, and ended in divorce in 1972. In the same year he married, at Caxton Hall, London, Mary Marcelle Georgius (1934/5&#150;1985), daughter of Georgius Guibourg, a well-known French music-hall entertainer. Marcelle wasted his money on attempted film productions and other extravagant enterprises and a lifestyle which was in total contrast to Maclean's very modest and unspectacular way of life. She died of cancer in Los Angeles in 1985, aged fifty and penniless, in spite of having had a substantial divorce settlement in 1977.<br>
<br>Maclean returned to England in the mid-1960s, having bought Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor. But restlessness soon took him to Geneva where he spent most of the early 1970s. He died on 2 February 1987 at University Hospital, Munich, during a winter holiday with his first wife, Gisela, in the Black Forest. He had been controlling his hard drinking, and his death followed a series of strokes. He lived the last eight years of his life alone in a rented villa just outside Dubrovnik, overlooking the Adriatic, with a view which reminded him of his Scottish west-coast origins. The landlord kept his apartment as a shrine after his death, but the typewriter, books, and other symbols of his writing den were plundered by federal troops during the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991.<br>
