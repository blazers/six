<span class="headword">Booth,  James</span>  (1796/7&#150;1880), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was the youngest of the four sons and two daughters of Thomas Booth (1749&#150;1832), a prosperous merchant of Toxteth Lodge, Liverpool, and his wife, Esther Noble (<i>d</i>. 1826). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2881/', "Henry Booth")</script>, the railway manager, was his elder brother. The family were Unitarians and prominent in the reform movement in Liverpool. James and his brothers campaigned for Lord Sefton, who stood against Canning in the general election of June 1818. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 7 November 1818, when his age was given as twenty-one, and matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in Lent 1819, but did not graduate. He was called to the bar in February 1824, building up a successful practice in the chancery courts. In 1827 he married a cousin, Jane Noble (<i>d</i>. 1872). He was among the remarkable group of lawyers and philosophic radicals who attended John Austin's lectures at University College, London, during 1828&#150;30. Subsequently he became a member of the council of University College, and framed its constitution.<br>
<br>In July 1833 Booth was appointed by the whig government as a member of the royal commission to inquire into municipal corporations; he and Charles Austin, brother of the jurist, investigated corporations in south and central Wales. In 1838 the speaker of the House of Commons, James Abercromby, appointed him to a temporary position preparing synopses (&#145;breviates&#146;) conveying the substance of private bills for the use of select committees. He was appointed counsel to the speaker and examiner of recognizances in 1839 by Abercromby's successor, Charles Shaw Lefevre. He established general principles for the form of private bills and, in collaboration with Robert John Palk, drew up outline bills, known as model bills, for all the more important classes of bills. These were the basis for his most important achievement, the <span class="roman">Clauses Consolidation Acts</span> of 1845 and 1847, which brought together the provisions common to all bills relating to compulsory land purchase, railway schemes, and company formations. As a result, individual railway bills were shortened by about 90 per cent, and select committees could very rapidly assess in which respects an individual bill deviated from general principles and raised questions of public policy. Booth's acts enabled parliament to deal with the great volume of bills generated by the railway boom of 1844&#150;6, and made procedures cheaper and more convenient for railway promoters (who included his brother). In 1850 he assisted his friend Sir John Romilly, the attorney-general, in preparing the act to regulate the court of chancery in Ireland.<br>
<br>Booth's post came under the scrutiny of a select committee on expenditure in 1848, and in 1850, fearing charges of sinecurism, Lord John Russell decided to abolish it (in the following year it was revived). On 10 October 1850 Booth accepted the office of secretary to the Board of Trade, in succession to Sir Denis Le Marchant, for which his experience of railway bills made him well qualified. During the long presidencies of Lord Stanley of Alderley (1852&#150;8) and Thomas Milner-Gibson (1859&#150;66), Booth and the other permanent officials decided most of the day-to-day issues which arose in the department. He retired from the secretaryship on 30 September 1865 and was created a CB on 6 July 1866.<br>
<br>As an experienced official, Booth was appointed a member of the royal commission on trade unions in February 1867. He was in close sympathy with the chairman, Sir William Erle, also a whig lawyer, and Erle entrusted to him the drafting of the commission's final report. Booth's draft, which restated the classical economic objections to trade unions, advocated a labour market free from artificial restrictions; he saw combinations as a form of protection, at variance with the commercial policy of free trade. His conclusions formed the basis for the report of the majority of the commission in 1869. He published in 1871 a utilitarian critique of organized religion, <span class="italic">The problem of the world and the church reconsidered, in three letters to a friend by a septuagenarian</span> (3rd edn, 1879), which argued that the church and its doctrines stood in the way of improving the material condition of mankind. Booth died at his home, 2 Princes Gardens, Knightsbridge, London, on 11 May 1880. He was survived by a son, George Booth (1829&#150;1892).<br>
