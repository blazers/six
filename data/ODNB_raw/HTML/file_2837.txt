<span class="headword">Bone,  Henry Pierce</span>  (1779&#150;1855), <span class="occ">miniature and enamel painter</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 6 November 1779, the eldest son and pupil of the enamel painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2836/', "Henry Bone (1755&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Van der Meulen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1830). He went to school in Tooting, Surrey, then trained under his father, learning to paint in oils and watercolour and in the art of enamelling. He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 17 March 1796, aged sixteen, but does not seem to have been too diligent a student; he had to be reprimanded for the late delivery of a life school drawing  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.1315&#150;1316). Three years later he began to exhibit at the Royal Academy, first portraits in oils, then subject pictures from the classics, Shakespeare, and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In 1833 his father became seriously ill (he died the following year) and, exploiting his early training, he turned to enamels, often of a size slightly larger than his father's. His first enamel exhibits were a copy of the <span class="italic">Virgin and Child</span> by Carlo Maratti, the <span class="italic">Infant Saviour</span> after Murillo, and portraits of the duchess of Kent, William IV, Georgiana, Lady Spencer, and Lavinia, Lady Spencer. He continued year after year, producing a stream of enamel copies of portraits by Holbein, Rubens, Van Dyck, Kneller, Reynolds, Benjamin West, Beechey, and Winterhalter, interspersed with several painted <i>ad vivum</i> by himself. The quality of his work may not have the delicate finish of his father's but the drawing is good and the colouring rich and faithful to the originals. He nearly always signed with his initials, &#145;HPB&#146;, and copiously annotated the counter-enamels with informative details. A substantial collection of his enamels, mostly historical portraits, are in the Royal Collection. Examples of his work are also in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London: <span class="italic">Charles I</span> (1825) after Van Dyck, <span class="italic">Rubens's Self-Portrait</span> (1834), <span class="italic">Sarah Duchess of Marlborough</span> (1843) after Kneller, <span class="italic">Isaac Newton</span> (1847) after Vanderbank; in the National Portrait Gallery, London: <span class="italic">Nelson</span> (1840) after Lemuel Abbott, and <span class="italic">Wellington</span> (1845) after Lawrence; in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge: <span class="italic">George IV</span>, one of many also copied by Henry Bone, after Lawrence; in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford: <span class="italic">Prince Albert</span> (1842) after Winterhalter; and in the Wallace Collection: <span class="italic">Lady Cockburn and her Three Eldest Sons</span> (1842) after the Reynolds now in the National Gallery, London. He was a prolific artist and many other enamels are in various museums and galleries, and private collections. He succeeded his father as enamel painter to Queen Adelaide, the duchess of Kent, and later Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, but in spite of several attempts at election he never became an associate of the Royal Academy. The whole Bone family was closely involved with the art community in London. In October 1805 Bone married Anna Maria, the daughter of a watchmaker, John Long, of Clerkenwell. They had three daughters, Louisa, Elizabeth, and Maria. Farington describes a dinner at which Mr and Mrs Henry Bone, Mr and Mrs Henry Pierce Bone, and one of the daughters entertained the painters Edmund Garvey, Thomas Stothard, Beechey, West, John Yenn, William Owen, Samuel Woodforde, Turner, and Callcott  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 11.3881).<br>
<br>Bone died at his home, 22 Percy Street, Bedford Square, London, on 21 October 1855. There was a sale of his enamels at Christies, on 13&#150;14 March 1856, when 172 of his best works fetched substantial prices. &#145;On the back of each enamel is indelibly recorded its history&#146;  (Christies sale catalogue), a practice which is of considerable value and interest to the historian and collector, especially in relation to the provenance of old masters.<br>
<br>Bone's brother, <a name="cosubject_2838"></a><span class="headword">Robert Trewick Bone</span>  (1790&#150;1840)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 24 September 1790, and was taught to paint by his father. He also studied at the Royal Academy Schools which he entered on 19 January 1809. He gained the academy's silver medal in 1811 and exhibited at the Royal Academy and British Institution from 1813 to 1841. An enamel portrait of him, copied by his brother William from a portrait by their father, is in the National Gallery, Dublin. He died at 6 Brompton Grove, Brompton, London, on 5 May 1840.<br>
<br>Another brother, William Bone (1792&#150;1846), also exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1815. His work included an enamel portrait of their father copied from an oil by John Opie, which are both in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Henry Bone's sons, and possibly a grandson, William, helped to produce an invaluable collection of their father's preliminary drawings, bound into three quarto albums in the National Portrait Gallery library, London.<br>
