<span class="headword">Bruce, Sir  Robert</span>, lord of Liddesdale  (<em>c.</em>1293&#150;1332), <span class="occ">royal bastard</span>, was the eldest son, albeit illegitimate, of Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick (1274&#150;1329), later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3754/', "Robert I")</script>. The identity of his mother is unknown, though she perhaps resided on or near the Bruces' Scottish estates, given that all her son's activities took place in Scotland. A French chronicler asserted that a royal bastard, surely this Robert, was one of those knighted by the king before Bannockburn; since the minimum age for knighthood was supposedly twenty-one, this suggests that he was born about 1293, when his father was a very young man. On the other hand, his sudden appearance in government records in 1321 may indicate that he reached his majority in that year, having been born <i>c</i>.1300. But the latter point is entirely hypothetical, and in any case does not preclude his having fought at Bannockburn.<br>
<br>In 1321 Bruce was granted Sprouston in Roxburghshire, forfeited by the English heirs of the Vescy family. In that or the following year he received the important border lordship of Liddesdale, recently forfeited by William Soulis for his part in the conspiracy of 1320 against King Robert. Liddesdale had as its caput the impressive castle of Hermitage, which dominated the western border between England and Scotland, and was thus a grant of some responsibility. Bruce was also given lands in Angus. He played a part in royal government, albeit sporadically, witnessing eight of his father's acts between 1323 and 1328, where he was usually acknowledged by the king as &#145;our son&#146;. In 1328 Robert I bestowed on him a gift of 500 merks. Most importantly, the younger Robert was involved in the rebuilding of the church of St Fillan; having successfully invoked the help of that saint before Bannockburn, the king had intended to found a daughter house of Inchaffray Abbey (to which St Fillan's Church and sanctuary were now attached) in Glendochart, Perthshire. Responsibility for the task passed to his son after his death.<br>
<br>On 6 August 1332 Bruce was one of the leaders of the force which unsuccessfully resisted English troops landing at Kinghorn in support of Edward Balliol's claim to the throne. On 11 August his career was cut short at the battle of Dupplin Moor, Perthshire. At the outset of the battle Bruce engaged in a violent quarrel with the guardian of Scotland, Donald, earl of Mar, whom he accused of pro-Balliol and pro-English sympathies. The result was a furious competition as to who could most clearly demonstrate his patriotism by reaching the enemy lines first, which had the effect of disrupting the Scottish attack and did much to ensure the loss of the battle. Both men were killed. Bruce does not appear to have married, and the lands of Liddesdale were later taken over by Sir Archibald Douglas.<br>
