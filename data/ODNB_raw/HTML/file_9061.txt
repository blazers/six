<span class="headword">Fagge,  Charles Hilton</span>  (1838&#150;1883), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Charles Fagge, medical practitioner, and nephew of John Hilton, was born at Hythe in Kent on 30 June 1838. Fagge entered Guy's Hospital medical school in October 1856, and in 1859 at his first MB examination at the University of London he gained three scholarships and gold medals, a rare distinction. In 1861 at the final MB examination he gained scholarships and gold medals for medicine and for physiology, and a gold medal for surgery. In 1863 he graduated MD, and he became a member (1864) and a fellow (1870) of the Royal College of Physicians. After being demonstrator of anatomy from 1862 to 1866, Fagge became medical registrar of Guy's in 1866, assistant physician in 1867, and physician in 1880. He was variously demonstrator of morbid anatomy, lecturer on pathology, and curator of the museum at Guy's. For over five years he was joint editor of <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>, and at the time of his death he was examiner in medicine to the University of London.<br>
<br>As a consulting physician Fagge had been rapidly rising to the front rank, owing much to his painstaking investigation of cases. His original papers and his <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Medicine</span>, published posthumously in 1886, mark out his significant contribution to medicine. The latter was described by <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> as &#145;one of the most scientific and philosophical works of its kind, being in truth a mine of clinical and pathological facts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 1, 1886, 20). He was an accomplished clinical physician and pathologist, a patient researcher, and a clear and concise teacher. Fagge was also physician to several insurance companies, and examiner to the Bournemouth Sanatorium. He published widely on a variety of medical topics, and he translated the first volume of Hebra's work on cutaneous diseases into English for the New Sydenham Society. He also classified and catalogued the series of models of skin diseases in the museum of Guy's Hospital.<br>
<br>Fagge and his wife, Emily Mary Christiana, had two daughters. He was quiet and unassuming in manner. He was fond of alpine climbing and in his early years had been a keen mountaineer. For the last year and a half of his life he suffered from an aortic aneurism. Having difficulty breathing, he died at midnight on 18&#150;19 November 1883, at his house in Grosvenor Street, London. His wife survived him.<br>
