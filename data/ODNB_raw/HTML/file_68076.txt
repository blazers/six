<span class="headword">Paget <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Masterson]</span>,  Briget</span>  (<em>b. </em>1570, <em>d.</em> in or after 1647), <span class="occ">literary editor</span>, was born in Nantwich, Cheshire, the daughter of Richard Masterson and Elizabeth Grosvenor. There is no record of her education but her preface to <span class="italic">Meditations of Death</span> shows her as literate and engaged in political and theological ideas. Its author, her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21114/', "John Paget (d. 1638)")</script>, was rector of Nantwich from 1598 to 1604, and their marriage must have taken place during this time. He was ejected for nonconformity, and the couple moved to the Netherlands, where he worked as an army pastor. They had no children of their own, but adopted John Paget's nephew Robert, who later became an English minister in the Netherlands. In 1607 John Paget was offered the pastorship of the newly opened Begynhof Church, Amsterdam, an English Reformed church under the aegis of the Dutch church. He retained this post until 1637, when he retired, owing to ill health, and died in 1638.<br>
<br>Most of what is known about Briget Paget is contained in her preface to her publication of her husband's posthumous work, <span class="italic">Meditations of death, wherein a Christian is taught how to remember and prepare for his latter end</span> (Dort, 1639). John Paget was active in the politics of the English church abroad, many of his publications being directed against Separatists, but he remained a strict Calvinist. Briget's support for his views is borne out by the contents of her preface; she speaks, for example, of &#145;those large lessons which by Divine providence have been dispensed to teach and affect with what may be helpful to mortification&#146;  (sig. A1). The Pagets actively supported the protestant and political cause of Elizabeth of Bohemia and her husband, both of whom attended services at Paget's church and remarked on his sermons. Briget dedicates her preface and edition of her husband's work &#145;To the most illustrious and most excellent lady, Elizabeth queene of Bohemia, Countess Palatine of the Rhine etc&#146; and suggests that they had a more intimate relationship when she speaks of &#145;the gentle and propitious respects your Majesty hath at sundry times manifested unto the author and sometimes also unto myselfe&#146;  (sig. A1). She makes an explicit and overt political prayer for their restoration to the Bohemian crown:<blockquote>The most high who ruleth in the kingdomes of men and giveth them to whomsoever he will, [may] he rayse and establish your throne and confirm it unto your princely progeny, that with his blessing the house of your Majesty may be blessed forever. (sig. A1)</blockquote>Briget Paget's preface to <span class="italic">Meditations of Death</span> shows that she was responsible for editing her husband's sermons for the purposes of publication, suggesting her active, intellectual engagement with his life and work. She frames her boldness in publishing within the conventional feminine modesty topos: the publication is primarily to salve her own loss, and is directly addressed to Elizabeth of Bohemia, rather than to a public audience.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1638 Briget Paget moved to live with her adopted son, Robert Paget, in Dordrecht, where he was minister. She managed her own money, since her name is on the sale, in 1647, of two properties previously owned by her husband in Amsterdam. In or after that year she died in Dordrecht. Her will echoed that of her husband's, leaving legacies to nephews and nieces, and to Robert Paget.<br>
