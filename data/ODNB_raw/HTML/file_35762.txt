</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ritchie,  Charles Thomson</span>, first Baron Ritchie of Dundee  (1838&#150;1906), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 19 November 1838 at Hawkhill, Dundee, the third of the three sons of William Ritchie (1798&#150;1867), landowner and jute merchant, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Thomson. William Ritchie, of Rockhill, Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire, was head of the firm of William Ritchie &amp; Son of London and Dundee, East India merchants, jute spinners, and manufacturers; the family had been connected with the burgh of Dundee for two centuries. James Ritchie, the eldest son, was lord mayor of London in 1903&#150;4. Charles Ritchie was educated for a business career. He attended the City of London School (1849&#150;53), and in 1853 he joined the London office of his father's firm. On 7 December 1858, a few days after his twentieth birthday, he married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Ower of Perth. They had three sons and seven daughters. Until 1874, Ritchie worked as a partner in the east London offices of the family business.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer18741886"></a>Early political career, 1874&#150;1886</h2>In 1874 Ritchie was returned at the head of the poll as tory MP for the immense two-member working-class constituency of Tower Hamlets. A tory untainted by aristocratic connections, Ritchie benefited from the reaction against Gladstone's first government; he may also have benefited from the mismanagement of the Liberal member for Tower Hamlets, A. S. Ayrton. Tories dubbed him a &#145;radical&#146; when, after his first session, he reported on his work in the House of Commons in a speech to his constituents. In the 1875 session he secured a bill extending the 1871 <span class="roman">Bank Holiday Act</span> to dockyard and customs workers, increasing his popularity with the east London working class. Ritchie's constituency contained several large sugar refineries, and during the Disraeli government of 1874&#150;80 he became involved in the campaign against the European bounties paid for the export of sugar beet which adversely affected both English sugar refiners and West Indian sugar planters. In 1879 he moved for the appointment of a select committee on sugar to investigate the foreign bounties and report on remedial measures; Ritchie himself proposed a &#145;countervailing duty&#146; equivalent to the bounty. Though he claimed that the duty would restore the principle of free trade, infringed by sugar bounties, Ritchie was in fact pressing for retaliation. After the Conservative election defeat of 1880, he became a leading member of the fair-trade movement. He led a deputation of sugar workers to call upon the prime minister, Gladstone, and in 1881 he introduced a motion proposing countervailing duties on sugar. He was opposed by Joseph Chamberlain, president of the Board of Trade, a parliamentary encounter which, the latter recalled (in a speech on 21 October 1903), began his conversion from free trade to protectionism&#151;a curious reversal of roles, as Ritchie was later to emerge as Chamberlain's leading free trade opponent. Ritchie's vigorous criticism of the 1880&#150;85 Gladstone government earned him a reputation for business ability. Having been returned for Tower Hamlets again in 1880 (at this election he came second to the Liberal James Bryce) Ritchie took the seat of St George-in-the-East when Tower Hamlets was divided into seven seats at the 1885 redistribution. He was returned for St George's at the elections of 1885 and 1886.<br>
<br>In Salisbury's caretaker administration of 1885&#150;6, Ritchie was appointed financial secretary to the Admiralty under Lord George Hamilton. Hamilton found him a first-class administrator but a poor speaker with an ungracious, curt manner. At the Admiralty Ritchie chaired a departmental committee investigating the management of dockyards and especially the slow production of warships. The committee succeeded in accelerating the construction of ironclads (from seven to under three years), and reducing the cost.<h2>
<a name="PresidentoftheLocalGovernmentBoard18861892"></a>President of the Local Government Board, 1886&#150;1892</h2>In August 1886 Salisbury formed his second ministry, and Ritchie was appointed president of the Local Government Board, initially without a seat in the cabinet; Henry Chaplin had refused the office on the grounds of his exclusion from cabinet. Balfour recognized Ritchie's ability but described him as a &#145;roughish diamond [who] will never rise as an orator in the House of Commons beyond the stage of a vigorous speaker on matters of business&#146;  (Williams, 156). Ritchie was the minister charged with the reform of local government, a measure central to the strategy of the Salisbury government. Not only was a democratic reform of the archaic system of county government the corollary of the extension of household suffrage to the counties in 1884; but devolution to local authorities was the Unionists' alternative to the Liberals' home rule. Ritchie initially proposed a limited bill along lines proposed by Hicks Beach&#151;&#145;if the landowners are to have half the taxation they should have half the representation too&#146;. By November Ritchie had abandoned this plan in favour of a wider scheme, possibly at the instance of Walter Long, his parliamentary under-secretary. Ritchie proposed to sweep away highway and sanitary boards, boards of guardians, and the administrative side of quarter sessions, and establish county and district councils elected by household suffrage. The transfer of the poor law to county councils elected by labourers was strenuously opposed by Salisbury, who objected on the grounds that it was &#145;rather like leaving the cat in charge of the cream jug&#146;. But Salisbury's proposal to leave the board of guardians out of the bill was vigorously resisted by Lord Randolph Churchill. Ritchie played little part in the involved cabinet disputes over local government, which pivoted on Salisbury's attempt to manoeuvre Churchill into an isolated and indefensible position. In spite of Churchill's support for his wider proposals, Ritchie did not identify himself too closely with Churchill; as W. H. Smith told Salisbury, Ritchie &#145;is a little wild, but he is manageable&#146;.<br>
<br>Churchill resigned at Christmas time 1886, G. J. Goschen became chancellor of the exchequer, and the cabinet agreed a local government scheme in January 1887. The existing system of municipal government (household suffrage plus <i>ex officio</i> aldermen) was to be introduced in the counties, thus meeting conditions set by Chamberlain. But, at Salisbury's prompting, poor-law and district councils were excluded from the scheme.<br>
<br>Ritchie was promoted to the cabinet in May 1887. Preparation of the <span class="roman">Local Government Bill</span> occupied him for nearly a year. He introduced the bill in March 1888; it was a voluminous and complex measure, and Ritchie piloted it successfully through parliament, displaying, as the parliamentary journalist Henry Lucy wrote, &#145;an ability, an energy and a tact which quickly won for him a high position in the House&#146;. An agreement between Chamberlain and Ritchie to support each other against critics in their own parties smoothed the bill's passage. Ritchie's main difficulty occurred over the licensing clauses of the bill. Though these reduced the number of licences, the clauses offended the temperance lobby by providing financial compensation for holders of cancelled licences, and they were withdrawn to save the bill. The <span class="roman">Local Government Bill</span> passed in August 1888. Perhaps its biggest weakness concerned London, which received separate treatment under the bill. Ritchie had proposed to create a county council for London, balanced by strong district councils, but in cabinet Goschen, who was anxious to protect the traditional privileges of the City, insisted on dropping district councils. The result was an over-mighty and over-centralized London county council. Ritchie advised that the 1889 LCC elections should be fought on non-party lines, but the Liberals or Progressives defied his advice, achieving a runaway victory; Ritchie was accused of permanently damaging Conservative interests in London.<br>
<br>In addition to the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span>, Ritchie was responsible for acts on allotments (1887, 1890), infectious diseases notification (1889), housing of the working classes (1890), and public health for London (1891). A second attempt to deal with the licensing question, in the <span class="roman">Local Taxation Bill</span> of 1890, was defeated. Largely thanks to Ritchie, the Salisbury government of 1886&#150;92 achieved a significant output of social reform. As Beatrice Webb wrote in her diary in 1890, &#145;Ritchie, the least known, is carrying out with painstaking industry the instructions left at the Local Government Board by his radical predecessor, Sir Charles Dilke&#151;and relieving the government of the reproach of being reactionary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 349). Along with W. H. Smith and Goschen, Ritchie represented the new style of Conservative businessmen politicians&#151;efficient, managerial, more interested in legislation and administration than rhetoric, the middle-class heirs to Disraeli's legacy of social reform. Ritchie's legislation helped make the Unionist alliance acceptable to Chamberlain; but Ritchie was acutely unpopular with his own party. The &#145;right wing&#146; of country gentlemen MPs grumbled at the county councils, and Salisbury attributed the loss of the 1892 election partly to the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> which, he maintained, alienated Conservative supporters in the counties. (In fact, elective county councils brought economic benefit to landowners; Goschen relieved rates by assigning national taxes to local authorities, and between 1887 and 1892 Treasury support for local government increased from &pound;4 million to &pound;8 million.)<br>
<br>Ritchie was defeated at St George-in-the-East at the 1892 election by John Benn, the Progressive whip on the LCC, affording a &#145;half-malicious satisfaction&#146; to some Conservatives. In 1894&#150;5 he sat as an alderman on the LCC. He unsuccessfully contested Walsall in February 1893. Ritchie was returned for the safe middle-class seat of Croydon at a by-election in May 1895, and he continued to represent the seat until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1905.<h2>
<a name="PresidentoftheBoardofTrade18951900homesecretary19001902"></a>President of the Board of Trade, 1895&#150;1900; home secretary, 1900&#150;1902</h2>Ritchie was appointed president of the Board of Trade in Salisbury's third government. He was largely responsible for the legislative output of the 1895&#150;1900 government, but his measures were unspectacular, as was the government's domestic record. He introduced the <span class="roman">Conciliation Act</span> (1896), establishing conciliation boards for the settlement of labour disputes. The <span class="roman">Light Railways Act</span> (1896) empowered local authorities compulsorily to purchase land for light railways. Ritchie initiated the establishment of a commercial intelligence branch at the Board of Trade (1899), responsible for providing information for manufacturers on empire markets. In 1898 his <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act</span> boosted the numbers of British merchant seamen by making an allowance to shipowners to carry boys for enrolment in the Royal Naval Reserve. The <span class="italic">Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act</span> of 1900 improved railway employees' safety.<br>
<br>After the 1900 election, Ritchie was promoted to home secretary, in spite of the fact that, as Balfour sarcastically remarked to Salisbury, he was &#145;the only member of the Cabinet so far who has put forward a personal claim!&#146;  (Young, 192). At the Home Office, he passed a large and complex measure consolidating and amending the <span class="roman">Factories and Workshops Act</span> (1901). His <span class="roman">Youthful Offenders Act</span> permitted young offenders on remand to be committed to the charge of a responsible person, rather than a prison or workhouse. Ritchie's chief legislative measure for 1902 was a licensing bill, which left out the question of compensation and dealt mainly with the suppression of drunkenness; it was well received by his own supporters.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequer19021903"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer, 1902&#150;1903</h2>In July 1902 Balfour succeeded Salisbury as prime minister and Hicks Beach resigned as chancellor of the exchequer. Austen Chamberlain and George Hamilton were named as possible chancellors, but the appointment went to Ritchie. Edward Hamilton, the snobbish Treasury secretary, complained in his diary that Ritchie was &#145;much too second-class. The first qualifications of a Chancellor of the Exchequer are <i>character</i> and being a <i>gentleman</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir E. W. Hamilton</span>, 390). However, he found Ritchie pleasant and easy to get on with, though without a mind of his own, &#145;and being somewhat lazily inclined I expect he will be keen to be led and to concur&#146;  (ibid., 423). Ritchie, who was now sixty-four, had no illusions about the post. He was reluctant to move from the Home Office, and he was already apprehensive about Chamberlain's fiscal plans. Yet it was as chancellor of the exchequer that Ritchie achieved distinction as a statesman, rather than a competent official politician.<br>
<br>The registration duty of 3<i>d</i>. on imported corn had been revived by Hicks Beach in the budget of 1902, and in October of that year Joseph Chamberlain suggested remitting the corn duty in favour of Canada as a preliminary to imperial preference. Ritchie objected strongly, and he circulated the cabinet with a memorandum (15 November 1902) calling for postponement of the issue until the budget. Ritchie's memorandum, which was largely drafted by Hamilton, stated the Treasury view that preference involved charging the British taxpayer in order to benefit the colonies; it also warned of the electoral danger of the expensive bread issue. On 19 November the cabinet provisionally decided to retain the corn duty for the time being and to make a preferential remission towards the colonies. Ritchie was the leading dissentient. In November Chamberlain departed on a winter tour of South Africa and, in his absence, Ritchie's attitude hardened. He was accused at the time and subsequently of deliberately misleading Balfour and the cabinet by remaining silent over the corn duty during the winter of 1902&#150;3. &#145;The hardening of Ritchie's Cobdenite orthodoxy proceeded throughout the winter in the recesses of the Treasury, without the Prime Minister being aware of what was going on&#146;, wrote Blanche Dugdale, Balfour's biographer. In a speech to his constituents (18 November 1903) Ritchie denied this charge, claiming that he spoke repeatedly to Balfour over the winter. As Edward Hamilton's diary shows, Ritchie endeavoured to enlist Balfour's support for the Treasury view. At the end of February 1903 he summoned up courage and warned Balfour that he would resign if preference was given on corn.<br>
<br>Rather than accept Ritchie's resignation, Balfour delayed a decision until Chamberlain's return; he sent the news of Ritchie's ultimatum out to Chamberlain in Madeira. After Chamberlain's return, the cabinet agreed (31 March 1903) to Ritchie's proposal to drop the corn duty in his budget. When Chamberlain urged retention of the corn duty and preferential remission in favour of Canada, Ritchie once more threatened resignation. Chamberlain replied that if the duty was not to be used for preferential purposes, it might as well be dropped. Almost single-handed, Ritchie had succeeded in wrecking Chamberlain's plan for preferential remission of the corn duty, and this, as Balfour wrote, after Chamberlain &#145;had just reason to suppose that in November the Cabinet as a whole were in his favour&#146;  (Chamberlain to duke of Devonshire, 27 Aug 1903, Sandars MSS, 740). Ritchie introduced his first and only budget on 23 April 1903. Budgeting for a post-South African War surplus of &pound;10,816 million on the basis of existing taxation, Ritchie cut 4<i>d</i>. from the income tax and abolished the corn duty. His budget speech, which was drafted almost entirely by Hamilton, proclaimed the government's support for free trade; it angered Balfour, because it transgressed his policy of neutrality, and it infuriated Chamberlain and the protectionists.<br>
<br>Chamberlain responded to his defeat in cabinet by making his famous Birmingham speech (15 May 1903), launching the policy of imperial preference, followed by a speech in the house (21 May), linking old age pensions to fiscal reform, in defiance of his undertaking to Balfour to remain silent. This annoyed Balfour and enraged Ritchie. Ritchie was fortified by Hamilton and Mowatt at the Treasury, who dissuaded him from resigning. &#145;If you were to resign [Chamberlain] would have succeeded&#146;, wrote Mowatt, &#145;but if you remain, and the Cabinet does not desert you, your victory becomes more established every day, and with it your power to resist a policy which I know you regard as disastrous&#146;  (23 May 1903, Ritchie MSS, BL, Add. MS 53780). Ritchie drew closer to the duke of Devonshire and the free trade ministers. After agreeing a form of words with Devonshire and Lansdowne and consulting Balfour, Ritchie made a speech on 9 June declaring his support for free trade: &#145;I cannot be party to a policy which, in my opinion, would be detrimental to both the country and the colonies&#146;, he told the house. He spoke, Balfour commented to Lady Elcho, &#145;quite extraordinarily badly, without force or charm or dexterity or logic&#146;  (Ridley and Percy, 200).<br>
<br>During the summer recess, Balfour conducted his independent inquiry into the fiscal question. He bypassed the Treasury and communicated directly with customs officials, causing Ritchie to complain that the prime minister was using the civil service to undermine him. In August Balfour circulated two cabinet papers: <span class="italic">Economic Notes on Insular Free Trade</span>, a general essay on retaliation which was later published, and a confidential Blue Paper proposing colonial preference. The cabinet met on 13 August, and Ritchie, along with the duke of Devonshire, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and Lord George Hamilton, objected strongly to the Blue Paper, though no decision was reached. During the month which intervened before the cabinet's next meeting, Balfour endeavoured to dissuade Devonshire from resigning, offering if necessary to drop the Blue Paper policy of preference on food. On 9 September Chamberlain wrote offering his resignation. Before the cabinet met on 14 September, Ritchie and Balfour of Burleigh circulated memoranda, protesting strongly against the Blue Paper and imperial preference. At the meeting, Balfour gave notice to Ritchie and Balfour of Burleigh because of their opposition to imperial preference. Ritchie later claimed that he had been dismissed on false pretences. As he wrote in an address to his constituents: &#145;We were told nothing about the communications which had passed between the prime minister and Mr Chamberlain. We therefore knew nothing about his proposed resignation and the consequent dropping of the preferential part of the scheme&#146;  (Ritchie MSS, BL, Add. MS 53780).<br>
<br>On 15 September Ritchie met the free trade ministers, Balfour of Burleigh, George Hamilton, and Devonshire; they agreed that they should all submit their resignations that evening. On 16 September, after Balfour had received the resignation letters of Ritchie, Hamilton, and Balfour of Burleigh, he saw Devonshire and told him of Chamberlain's decision to resign. The following day the duke withdrew his resignation, and on 18 September Chamberlain's letter of resignation was published. Ritchie now led the attack on the duke, persuading him to change his mind once more. He wrote to Devonshire (28 September), charging him with breaking an understanding that the free trade ministers should all act together, and that Ritchie, Hamilton, and Balfour of Burleigh should be given an opportunity to reconsider their position if the duke decided to stay. By appealing to his sense of honour, Ritchie made the duke acutely uncomfortable, and on 2 October he resigned.<br>
<br>Ritchie has been described by the historian A. M. Gollin as &#145;the forgotten man&#146; of the controversy  (Gollin, 29). He was instrumental not only in dropping the corn duty but also in persuading the duke of Devonshire to resign. Ritchie displayed a courage and determination during the controversy which owed not a little to his recognition that his cabinet career was nearing an end. As so often in cabinet disputes, issues of principle were overlaid by personal feeling. Ritchie was driven by distrust of Chamberlain. He probably resented Chamberlain's popularity and success and, as Balfour's secretary J. S. Sandars suggested, the fact that Chamberlain &#145;who, though he only became a member of a Unionist administration in 1895, had passed him in a stride&#146;. After Salisbury's retirement, Ritchie complained to Edward Hamilton that Chamberlain not Balfour dominated the cabinet; and it was Chamberlain's ascendancy that he determined to block. Ritchie was incapable of hiding his hatred of Chamberlain: Almeric Fitzroy observed him with the outgoing ministers at the council at Buckingham Palace, lurking behind a pillar, &#145;whence in melodramatic gloom he glared fixedly at the villain of the piece [Chamberlain], who was quite undisturbed by the demonstration&#146;  (Fitzroy, 1.158). Ritchie moreover was excessively under the influence of the Treasury officials, especially Edward Hamilton, a dependence which emerges clearly from the account of the crisis in Hamilton's diary. None the less, Ritchie was largely responsible for blocking Chamberlain's policy of imperial preference; but whether this was a good thing, or whether Ritchie envisaged any coherent alternative to the problems which Chamberlain's proposal was designed to address, is by no means clear.<br>
<br>Ritchie played a small part in the Unionist free-trade movement after his resignation. He was devastated by the death of his wife on 10 February 1905. In the same year, on his retirement as MP, he was created Baron Ritchie of Dundee (not a viscount, as he had a right to expect). In 1906 he was unofficially invited to become chairman of the poor-law royal commission, a &#145;stupendous job&#146;, as he remarked&#151;the fitting conclusion to the career of a statesman consistently sympathetic towards the welfare of the poor. Ritchie died suddenly in Biarritz on 9 January 1906 before he could take up the appointment. He was buried in Kensal Green. He was succeeded by his second son, Charles (1866&#150;1948); his eldest son, William, had died young in 1879.<br>
<br>Ritchie was a big, dark, swarthy man. According to Sandars, he was given to &#145;heavy and affected pleasantry &hellip; His abilities were of the second class, but he was a hard-working minister of pedestrian methods&#146;  (Young, 199). This was unfair. In a party of aristocrats and social climbers, Ritchie's virtues were at a discount. His business skill, his industry, and persistence were essential to the legislative output of the Salisbury governments; and though he may have lacked judgement during the crisis of 1902&#150;3, he certainly displayed courage and strength of character.<br>
