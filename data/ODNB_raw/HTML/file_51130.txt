<span class="headword">Hobson, Sir  Harold</span>  (1904&#150;1992), <span class="occ">theatre critic</span>, was born on 4 August 1904 in Thorpe Hesley, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, the only son of Jacob Hobson, miner, and later insurance agent, and his wife, Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKegg. Although left disabled by polio in his eighth year and largely educated at home by his working-class parents, who brought him large quantities of books from the public library, he recovered sufficiently to attend Sheffield grammar school, from where he gained a scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford; he graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1928. While at Oxford he met and developed a close friendship with Erwin Canham, later editor of the <span class="italic">Christian Science Monitor</span>. Hobson began to write London theatre reviews for the paper in 1931, and in 1935 he was placed on its permanent staff. He remained its London drama critic until 1974. Regular employment enabled him to marry, on 13 July 1935, a radiantly cheerful schoolteacher, Gladys Bessie (Elizabeth) Johns (1900&#150;1979), eldest daughter of James Johns. The marriage was the cornerstone of Hobson's private and professional life. They had one daughter, Margaret.<br>
<br>As Hobson made clear in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Indirect Journey</span> (1978), his critical attitudes were shaped by his experiences of life. His crusading moral zeal was a legacy of his parents' faith (which he inherited) in Christian Science and its belief in the unreality of disease. His catholicity of taste was formed by his omnivorous early reading, which embraced everything from the Authorized Version to the entire works of Sir Walter Scott. And his emphasis in acting on the import of a single gesture, or even a vocal inflection, was a consequence of his own severe physical restrictions. His subjective approach to theatre was complemented by formidable scholarship but he was, essentially, a romantic critic who believed in the passionate communication of a highly individual response.<br>
<br>Hobson's romanticism was fuelled by his boyhood experiences of theatregoing in Sheffield: seeing Sir John Martin-Harvey in the Dickensian adaptation, <span class="italic">The Only Way</span>, he was haunted by the heart-rending desolation with which the actor expressed his failure to arouse affection or esteem. But Hobson's impressionable temperament was accompanied by a shrewd intellect: as an Oxford history student he was overwhelmed by Thucydides' account of the disastrous Athenian expedition against Syracuse which, with its famous reversal of fortune, affected his view both of drama and of the structure of theatrical criticism.<br>
<br>It was through a mixture of enterprise and good fortune that Hobson became drama critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. In 1939 he provided the newspaper with a front-page scoop about the evacuation of schools in the event of war. That led to regular book-reviewing throughout the war, his appointment as assistant literary editor in 1942, and from 1945 his acting as deputy to the paper's legendary drama critic, James Agate. The belated discovery by the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>'s proprietor, Lord Kemsley, of Agate's homosexuality led to Hobson, an approved family man, being appointed his successor in 1947. He remained as theatre critic of the paper until 1976.<br>
<br>In his early years Hobson championed the work of T. S. Eliot, Christopher Fry, and John Whiting, who, like himself, were all committed Christians. But two significant events elevated him into a critic of enormous influence. One, paradoxically, was the appointment of Kenneth Tynan as his opposite number at <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1954: Tynan's voluptuous stylishness was seen as the antithesis of Hobson's puritan zeal, but it gave Sunday theatre-reviewing the heady air of a keenly fought intellectual duel. Even more crucial was the emergence in the 1950s of a new style of drama to which Hobson responded with intuitive understanding. He carried on a weekly campaign on behalf of Samuel Beckett's <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span> (1954), helping it to become a commercial success. He recognized, though less vehemently than Tynan, the romantic individualism of John Osborne's <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1956) and, alone of all critics, he saw the merits of Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">The Birthday Party</span> (1958), describing its author as &#145;the most original, disturbing and arresting talent in theatrical London&#146;  (Elsom, 85) and encouraging him, after the play's box-office failure, to go on writing.<br>
<br>Not all Hobson's enthusiasms were widely shared: few others believed as steadfastly as he in the dramatic genius of William Douglas-Home. However, his love of French theatre was enormously influential in breaching English isolationism. His adoration for Edwige Feuill&egrave;re and Jean-Louis Barrault was well known, but it was his endorsement of dramatists such as Jean Genet, in whom he heard echoes of the Catholic mass, and Marguerite Duras, that led to their gradual acceptance in Britain. In recognition of his pioneering enthusiasm, which included such books as <span class="italic">The French Theatre of Today</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">French Theatre since 1830</span> (1978), he was created a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1960. He returned the decoration eight years later in protest at the French government's dismissal of Jean-Louis Barrault from his tenure at the Od&eacute;on. In 1971 he was created CBE for his services to theatre and he was knighted in 1977. The honour he most prized, since his adolescent ambition had been to become an Oxford academic, was being elected honorary fellow of Oriel College in 1974.<br>
<br>Hobson was often regarded as a wayward, mercurial critic. His lasting achievement lay in his constant championship of avant-garde writers. His most distinctive quality was his ability to discover an epiphanic experience in a single moment, such as Olivier's rising inflection on the phrase &#145;troops of friends&#146; in the course of Macbeth's downfall. Penelope Gilliatt once wrote that &#145;the characteristic sound of an English Sunday was that of Harold Hobson barking up the wrong tree&#146;  (Hobson, <span class="italic">Indirect Journey</span>, 107). Posterity has shown that, more often than not, he barked up the right tree.<br>
<br>Hobson's life was an astonishing triumph over disability. His kindness to young critics was a constant inspiration. However, his greatest happiness came from his marriage to Elizabeth. Following her death in 1979 he wrote (in his 1981 <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry, under &#145;recreations&#146;) of &#145;her incomparable charm and wisdom, and the unquenchable radiance of her personality&#146;. On 7 April 1981 he married their friend Nancy Penhale (1909&#150;1992), who remained his companion during his final days in Westhampnett Nursing Home, Westhampnett, Chichester, Sussex. He died there on 12 March 1992. He was survived by his wife and the daughter of his first marriage. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 24 November 1992.<br>
