<span class="headword">Josselin,  Ralph</span>  (1617&#150;1683), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and diarist</span>, was born on 26 January 1617 at Roxwell in Essex, the first son and third child of John Josselin (<i>d</i>. 1636), farmer, and his wife, who was probably called Anne.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Josselin's early education was at Bishop's Stortford. By his own account he was an eager pupil, with a special love of books and histories, both secular and biblical. From his early days, he claimed, he showed a desire to become a clergyman. He loved to hear ministers preach and afterwards to imitate them&#151;&#145;acting in corners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1)&#151;and to walk home solitarily to meditate on the sermon. His mother died in 1624 when he was not yet eight and when Josselin was in his early teens his father&#151;an unsuccessful farmer&#151;married again. Josselin seems not to have got on with his stepmother and in 1633 he was sent to Jesus College, Cambridge. Despite interruptions to his studies caused by lack of money, he received his BA in 1636&#150;7 (and his MA in 1640). His father died in 1636. Having toyed with thoughts of becoming either a farmer or a lawyer, Josselin decided on a career in the church, and spent the next three years trying to support himself in a succession of posts as schoolteacher and curate. In March 1641 he became vicar of the parish of Earls Colne, Essex, where he was to spend the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="Josselinasclergyman"></a>Josselin as clergyman</h2>Josselin described himself as, at birth, &#145;the seed of the righteous&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1). His own record of his passage into the ministry makes clear his religious identity as a puritan. He disapproved of the religious changes introduced by Charles I's archbishop, &#145;that great stickler for all outward pomp&#146;  (ibid., 31) William Laud, changes that were making their mark on the Cambridge he attended. At his ordination in February 1640 Josselin refused to bow towards the altar. Having been encouraged to enter the church by John Borodale, vicar at his father's parish and himself a man questioned for his nonconformity, he was well suited to be minister at Earls Colne. This was a parish which had acquired a reputation for nonconformity under Thomas Shepard, who had been forced to flee to New England, and under its godly patrons and lords of the manor, the Harlakenden family, with whom Josselin was to form a very close relationship.<br>
<br>Josselin's arrival at Earls Colne coincided with the beginnings of parliament's attack on the Caroline church, and his long tenure with the prolonged period of instability precipitated by the failure to agree on the structure of a reformed church and later the growth of nonconformity following the reimposition of Anglican uniformity at the Restoration. His diary provides an intimate picture of the hopes and fears that these changes brought to a deeply religious man.<br>
<br>Josselin welcomed the religious freedom parliament's reforms brought, signing the 1642 petition to parliament from Essex in support of further reform. He rejected the &#145;heavy burden&#146; of the prayer-book service and he ensured that at the earliest opportunity the parish swept away idolatrous imagery from the church. But thereafter he was caught between his desire, in accordance with his strict Calvinist beliefs, to exclude from the sacrament of the communion those who were not in the company of God's saints, and his pressing concern to promote throughout his parish a moral reformation that required regular and universal church attendance. In the absence of an effective national church he found himself also worried by those separatists who regarded liberty as an invitation to form their own churches and to worship after their own fashion.<br>
<br>In the early 1640s Josselin found comfort in his ability to meet together regularly with a select group of his honest and godly neighbours in voluntary prayer and discussion. By 1647 this had come to be formalized in what Josselin termed &#145;the society&#146;. There are repeated references in the diary to its meetings, especially for the period from 1647 to 1657. With his patrons the Harlakendens and other leading families active in the meetings, it provided Josselin with significant spiritual assistance throughout the turbulent days of civil war, revolution, and Restoration. Josselin needed support since he faced challenges in his ministry from both spiritual enthusiasm and what he termed spiritual apathy. By 1647 he was noting in his diary that his &#145;congregacion growes very thinne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 93), but this had less to do with spiritual apathy than with the spiritual antipathy that Josselin faced from some of the parish. For, although it is clear from his diary that Josselin was an effective and active preacher, receiving invitations to preach elsewhere in the county and at Paul's Cross in London, his policies within Earls Colne made him unpopular with a section of the parish. (It may be significant that the only time Josselin recorded preaching to a full church, with parishioners outside the church forced to listen through the windows, was in a dream.) Like other godly ministers Josselin was anxious to suppress popular festivities. These were occasions of sin in the eyes of the godly, what Josselin himself attacked as &#145;the jollity and vanity of the time that custome hath wedded us unto&#146;  (ibid., 30). That Josselin used the pulpit to attack such practices, intervening personally on one occasion to scatter the youth at play on the green, probably did little for his popularity. But an important consequence of his readiness to find spiritual support in the more select gathering of &#145;the society&#146; probably had a larger role to play. Josselin's worries that universal communion might mean that those who lacked evidence of grace and salvation would endanger the purity of the sacrament had led him to abandon communion in the early 1640s. It is clear that this decision caused him considerable soul-searching. When communion was restored early in 1651 his moving entry in his diary provides powerful testimony of the importance of the sacrament to the godly. But when communion was restored, it was done only after considerable discussion with other members of Josselin's immediate religious circle, and the restrictions placed on those who could receive effectively made it a closed communion available to only a minority of parishioners. Reintroduction led to a period of prolonged worry for Josselin as to what would happen if parishioners presented themselves for communion who were thought unworthy.<br>
<br>Josselin's consciousness of what he termed confusions and disorders in parish and country help to explain his recognition of the need for a national church and his support for a presbyterian church settlement. Josselin was an eager signatory of the solemn league and covenant and confided in his diary his disappointment that parliament did not ensure its full implementation. He was one of the signatories to the 1648 petition in support of the church settlement proposed by the Westminster assembly, <span class="italic">A testimony of the ministers in the province of Essex to the truth of Jesus Christ and to the solemn league and covenant, as also against the errors, heresies and blasphemies of these times and of the toleration of them</span>. He discussed the establishment of parochial classes with Matthew Newcomen and he was named as minister for Earls Colne in the proposed presbyterian church settlement for Essex. But in his practice, as in the petition he signed, Josselin was prepared to allow for the tender consciences of dissenting brethren. He was hostile, however, to those who wished to separate altogether from the church. Almost from the start of his ministry he was troubled by separatists within the parish; while this led to another source of anxiety in the diary, it later became something of a preoccupation with the emergence of the Quakers in the 1650s.<br>
<br>With the failure of a national settlement, entries in Josselin's diary reveal the intensity with which he, in association with other ministers and with his immediate religious circle, debated both matters of faith and church government. Confronted by enormous changes both in the kingdom and abroad, from 1647 Josselin began to exhibit in the diary an active belief in millenarianism, recording and seeking to interpret both his and his children's dreams, as well as major episodes in the Europe-wide battle between Catholics and protestants and rumours of the return of the Jews to England, as evidence for the imminence of Christ's second coming.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Josselin&#151;to his continuing surprise and puzzlement&#151;was allowed to continue as vicar of Earls Colne, while all around him his fellow godly ministers were expelled. Although references to &#145;the society&#146; cease after 1662, it is clear that Josselin still had a circle of godly friends with whom he could pray and seek advice. It is also clear that he continued quietly to resist the reintroduction of an Anglican liturgy. He only reintroduced the prayer book communion service into the parish in 1665 after being summoned before the church courts the previous year, in what was to be the first of several appearances for his unwillingness to conform. But when communion was restored, Josselin recorded only a small number of communicants&#151;usually less than twenty in a parish where several hundred were eligible. These well-known figures have led some historians to use Josselin as a witness to growing plebeian indifference, but they suggest perhaps that Josselin and his godly circle may have continued to exercise&#151;albeit informally&#151;restrictions on eligibility.<h2>
<a name="Josselinasdiarist"></a>Josselin as diarist</h2>Ralph Josselin's main claim to fame lies in the detailed diary he kept. This diary, one of the richest and most important to survive for the seventeenth century, has suffered various vicissitudes. It was lost or stolen in the nineteenth century and recovered by a chance purchase for 6<i>d</i>. by the Victorian novelist Mrs Oliphant. A scholarly edition prepared for the Camden Society in the first decade of the twentieth century omitted almost three-quarters of the original with the justification that only the repetitive &#145;many entries of no interest whatever&#146; had been excised. The Josselin that emerged from this edition of the diary was very much the public man, whose comments on the great religious and political issues of his day were what most merited attention. He was a moderate parliamentarian, active in electioneering and petitioning and worried by the emergence of more radical groups like the Levellers, and served for a brief spell as a chaplain in the parliamentarian army and assisted locally with the implementation of measures for the reform of the church and augmentation of livings; he suffered plundering by royalist troops for his active organization of the defence of the village in 1648 at the siege of Colchester. Although unhappy at the king's execution, he retained his support for what he called the &#145;honest party&#146; even after the Restoration. Josselin's well-informed comments on political events both in England and on the continent (on which he made an annual end-of-year report in his diary) reflect the social depth to political knowledge in mid-seventeenth-century England.<br>
<br>Renewed examination of the manuscript diary in the 1960s disclosed how much had been excluded. It revealed the possibilities for a rich and intimate portrait of the man and the social, cultural, and mental worlds he inhabited. Such was the quality of the evidence that Josselin became perhaps the first man in British history whose biography formed the subject for &#145;an essay in historical anthropology&#146;  (Macfarlane), and this in turn led to a pioneering large-scale study of his parish of Earls Colne. Finally, a complete edition of the diary appeared in 1976.<br>
<br>After a retrospective of his early life in its early pages, the diary offers a detailed (and for the core years often daily) account of Josselin's life. The picture that emerges allows the reader to see Josselin properly in context, to sympathize with much that seems familiar in his life, and to puzzle over much that is foreign and strange. Married and family life feature strongly. He writes of falling in love and marrying a wife&#151;Jane (<i>c</i>.1621&#150;1693), daughter of Thomas Constable of Olney, Buckinghamshire, whom he married on 28 October 1640 and with whom he was to spend all but a few months of the forty-three years of their marriage living and working together. He writes with pride and affection of his relations with his children and of his evident concern to see them settled, but with irritation when relationships with them (or his wife) did not go the way he planned or expected. He writes movingly of their illnesses and deaths; two of his ten children died soon after birth, and one&#151;his beloved Mary&#151;in early childhood. A sense of loss and sensitivity to the psychological needs of the survivors clearly informed the counselling he offered in a funeral sermon of 1652, his only published sermon. But in seeking explanations for why God took away his ten-day-old son Ralph, Josselin opens a window on to another world when he finds the explanation in a punishment for his playing too much chess. As his references to a monstrous birth and parishioners who had seen the devil reveal, for all the intimate familiarity of his family life, Josselin inhabited a very different mental world.<br>
<br>The Josselin of the restored diary is a man himself vulnerable to the threats posed by illness, anxiously and endlessly noting the condition of his urine or the recurring problems he had with an infected navel. He was a man who needed to combine his pastoral duties, his scholarship, and his love of books (of which he was a frequent purchaser) with the need to secure a living. A worry over money is a constant theme. Earls Colne as a living never quite lived up to his expectations and this led to hard negotiations with his parishioners on whose tithes and voluntary (but, for many in the parish, often reluctant) donations he much depended, and it prompted threats and thoughts of moving to other livings, which were scotched by the renewed generosity of his patrons, the Harlakendens. A generous bequest from a wealthy parishioner helped to establish him as a farmer from the mid-1640s.<br>
<br>Frequent references to the weather and state of the harvest are but the most common of the many other topics noted in Josselin's detailed diary. But his references to the weather reveal a deeper significance, one that clearly informed the purpose of his diary-keeping. He saw in the weather, especially that causing a run of poor harvests in the later 1640s and coinciding with the greatest period of religious and political uncertainty, worrying evidence of divine displeasure. Running through the diary is a concern to understand the ways of God in relation to events in his world and in his own life, and to the question of his own salvation. As frequent entries make clear, Josselin subscribed to a providentialist reading of the world as one in which God intervened directly in the lives of individuals and the societies in which they lived, punishing sin and rewarding right living. Keeping a diary allowed Josselin to reflect on evidence of divine interventions&#151;general through sword, famine, and plague and particular in the manifold mercies that he and his family enjoyed in escaping illness or accident. For all its rich detail of a past life, the primary purpose of Josselin's diary-keeping reflected the rigorous self-inspection by which the godly were expected to live their lives. Thus, when he survived a bee sting on the nose, Josselin was moved to record the incident in his diary, noting unselfconsciously that &#145;divine providence reaches to the lowest things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 19).<br>
<br>Josselin died in August 1683, and was buried at Earls Colne on 30 August. By the time of his death he had secured a comfortable material existence. But even to the end, his diary, maintained until the month before his death, reveals a man trying to fulfil his parochial duties, continually concerned with his children's lives, receptive to political news (particularly of the fate of godly dissenters), and still, amid entries increasingly caught up with documenting his failing health, continuing to note, &#145;God good to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 645).<br>
