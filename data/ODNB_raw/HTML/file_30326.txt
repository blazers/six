<span class="headword">Abraham,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Mabon]</span>  (1842&#150;1922), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Cwmafan, near Port Talbot, Glamorgan, on 14 June 1842, the fourth son of Thomas and Mary Abraham. His father, a coalminer and copper smelter, soon died, leaving his mother to raise a large family. Mabon, as he was generally known, ended his formal education at the national school, Cwmafan, at the age of ten, when he started work underground as a door boy. On 18 August 1860 he married Sarah Williams (<i>bap</i>. 1842, <i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of David Williams, the local blacksmith. They had twelve children, of whom eight survived infancy. Sarah died suddenly on 13 July 1900.<br>
<br>After an abortive trip to Chile in search of work in 1864&#150;5, Mabon worked at Cwmafan spelter works and a tinplate works near Swansea, before returning to coalmining at Caercynydd pit, near Gowerton. The rest of his life was bound up with coal and coalminers. In 1871 he addressed his first union meeting, speaking for the Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM), which was newly recruiting in south Wales, and set up an AAM lodge at Waunarlwydd. In 1872 he was elected treasurer of Loughor district and to the national executive. His attendance at the executive's Manchester meetings led to dismissal as a collier: in December 1872 he worked his last shift as a miner and became paid agent of the Loughor district of the AAM.<br>
<br>In the underdeveloped state of trade unionism in south Wales, Mabon's meteoric rise was perhaps unexceptional: what was remarkable was the extent to which he then dominated mining unionism there for nearly forty years. After the AAM rapidly withered amid the depression and defeats of 1874&#150;5, he became the main figure, charged with keeping the idea of trade unionism alive. As part of the settlement of the five-month lock-out of 1875 (the third major stoppage in five years), the coal owners had determined on a system whereby wage rates would be &#145;automatically&#146; adjusted to the market price of coal. Part of the mechanism for this scheme was a joint sliding scale committee: in July Mabon became the first chairman of the workers' side, a position he held until the sliding scale was abandoned in 1902. He was president of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF) from its inception in 1898 until he resigned in 1912, making way for more aggressive leaders.<br>
<br>The eventual demand for a different leadership style largely explains why Mabon's reputation slumped for a long period after his death. He was charged with presiding over and preserving an innocuous form of trade unionism. Apart from supporting the sliding scale, there was the ambiguity of union finances, including the pay of agents such as Mabon, which was dependent on employers making deductions from pay. It was also felt that at his death Mabon left more money (&pound;32,777 net) than was proper for a union leader. Against all this, Mabon's career must be seen in the context of the near total collapse of unionism by the mid-1870s. After his original base at Loughor disappeared, he moved to the Rhondda in 1877 to become the agent for the Cambrian Miners' Association, the largest of several district-based organizations which kept the notion of unionism alive. Mabon's role was indispensable: he was a compelling orator in both languages and won general acceptance as the legitimate, responsible voice of labour. His status as a major public figure was exemplified by the fact that manufacturers of tobacco and sauces sought his endorsement. Above all, the later recriminations in a different industrial climate ignored the robust claims he had advanced for the rights of labour.<br>
<br>The first challenge to his dominance came with the formation in 1888 of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), which totally opposed sliding scale systems. A small branch was set up in Monmouthshire under the able leadership of William Brace, but Mabon comfortably saw off this threat. But the harder line adopted by coal owners gradually undermined his advocacy of conciliation. In 1896 they disdainfully rejected his proposals for raising prices by restricting output. In 1898 they imposed a deliberately humiliating settlement after a bitter six-month stoppage. In response the miners immediately formed the SWMF, and installed Mabon as president. At the next MFGB conference, Mabon attended as one of &#145;three penitent Welshmen&#146; who renounced sliding scales.<br>
<br>The 1898 settlement had signalled the limits of conciliation: a decade later the <span class="roman">Mines Eight Hour Act</span>, which had its greatest effect in south Wales, effectively made the policy completely unworkable. It simultaneously reduced miners' piece-work earnings while raising owners' costs. The result was especially poignant since Mabon, the apostle of conciliation, had also championed the eight-hour day. Faced with lower living standards and worsened working conditions, miners looked to younger, more aggressive leaders. The turbulence of the coalfield in the year-long Cambrian combine strike of 1910&#150;11 over abnormal places, and the national 1912 struggle for a minimum wage, was not the world which Mabon, now nearly seventy, had hoped to create. He stepped down as SWMF president, but still served the industry through the International Miners' Congress and as MFGB treasurer.<br>
<br>Alongside his central concern with miners' unionism, William Abraham was elected to parliament for Rhondda in 1885. He thus became the first Welsh miners' MP, defeating the official Liberal candidate, a local coal owner, and held the seat (Rhondda up to 1918, then West Rhondda) until he retired in 1920. Essentially a Liberal, he reluctantly renounced the label when the MFGB joined the Labour Party in 1909. He made no great mark in the House of Commons as an orator, but served on three royal commissions (mining royalties, 1889; labour, 1891; and mines, 1906). He was appointed JP in 1887, was sworn of the privy council in 1916, and received an LLD from the University of Wales in 1918. Mabon was a lifelong Calvinistic Methodist, a lay preacher, Band of Hope activist, and a renowned choir conductor, with a rich tenor voice of his own. In person he was very striking and wore a substantial black beard. Keir Hardie described him in 1888 as being &#145;five feet by four feet, correct measurement, so that he is not as broad as he is long, though I should say he soon will be&#146;  (W. J. Stewart, <span class="italic">Keir Hardie</span>, 1921, 45). He died at his home, Brynybedw, in Pentre, Glamorgan, on 14 May 1922, and was buried on 18 May at Treorci cemetery. His funeral effectively closed the entire valley with its mixed throng of populace and personages.<br>
