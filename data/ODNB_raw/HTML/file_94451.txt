<span class="headword">Fontane,  Theodor</span>  (1819&#150;1898), <span class="occ">novelist and travel writer</span>, was born in Neuruppin, Brandenburg, Prussia, on 30 December 1819, the son of Louis Henri Fontane (1796&#150;1867), apothecary, and his wife, Emilie (<i>d</i>. 1869). Of French descent, he was baptized Henri Th&eacute;odore Fontane, but was usually known by his German name. When he was eight his family moved to Swinem&uuml;nde, where his father had bought an apothecary's shop. He briefly attended the <i>Gymnasium</i> (grammar school) in Neuruppin, and then the K. F. Kl&ouml;dens School of Commerce in Berlin. In 1836 he began work as an apothecary's apprentice in Berlin. In 1839 his first published work appeared, the novella <span class="italic">Geschwisterliebe</span>; his first poems appeared in 1840. In 1842 he translated Chartist lyrics into German; in 1843&#150;4 he translated <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. In 1844 he volunteered for a year's military service in the Kaiser Franz Gardegrenadier regiment.<br>
<br>Between 25 May and 10 June 1844, at the invitation of his friend Hermann Scherz, Fontane took leave of his army duties and made his first journey to England. They sailed by steamer from Hamburg to London, anchoring near the Tower of London. Apart from the customary tourist sites, Fontane visited Brighton, Greenwich, Blackwall, Woolwich, and Windsor. His detailed and enthusiastic diary shows him to be already steeped in Shakespeare, Byron, and other English authors; as he puts it, he &#145;had long looked towards England like the Jews in Egypt to Canaan&#146;  (Fontane, <span class="italic">Wanderungen</span>, 1.59), seeing it as a land of political and journalistic freedom. His grasp of English was as yet insecure, but he enjoyed English pubs, beer, and plum pudding.<br>
<br>From 1849 to 1878 Fontane worked primarily as a journalist and critic, but also held various Prussian government posts on a short-term basis. These included working as a correspondent for the central press agency, and as secretary to the Academy of Arts. In 1850 he married Emilie Rouanet-Kummer (1824&#150;1902), with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Beset by poor health and financial problems, and low in spirits, Fontane obtained permission from the literary cabinet of the Prussian government to spend the summer of 1852 in London as a foreign correspondent. Resident there between 22 April and 25 September, he published sketches and essays in various German newspapers, combining them with reminiscences from his earlier visit in the volume <span class="italic">Ein Sommer in London</span>, published in 1854. Among the essays are an atmospheric evocation of the empty crystal palace left deserted after the Great Exhibition of 1851, and a passionate defence of Lady Hamilton against rigid Victorian morality.<br>
<br>Fontane returned to Britain for a third visit between 10 September 1855 and 15 January 1859. Working for the Prussian government as a press agent, he was officially employed to write reports on the English press, with an eye to Anglo-Prussian relations. His relationship with the Prussian bureaucracy was a precarious one; Berlin was suspicious of his literary style, his personality, and his (supposedly too liberal) politics. From early in 1856 onwards he worked primarily as a freelance journalist for various German newspapers. In the same year he visited Oxford, where he met Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller, and wrote a series of essays on the British university system; his observations on the power struggle between the Oxford colleges and the university are acute. His wife and children joined him in London, where he had rented a house, in 1857. In August 1858 he travelled to Scotland with his friend Bernhard von Lepel. His route took him from Edinburgh north to Stirling and Inverness, then west to Oban, Staffa, and Iona; a lover of Walter Scott, he also visited Melrose and Abbotsford.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Aus England: Studien und Briefe &uuml;ber Londoner Theater, Kunst und Presse</span> and <span class="italic">Jenseit des Tweed</span> (&#145;Beyond the Tweed&#146;) were both published in 1860, using material that had for the large part already appeared in newspapers. <span class="italic">Aus England</span> concentrates on the London theatre, with particular reference to Shakespeare; it includes a contemporary and historical survey of the English press, and a description of industrial Manchester, which Fontane visited in 1857. <span class="italic">Jenseit des Tweed</span>, with its combination of topography, history, local legends, and literary interest, provided the model for the massive, four-volume project <span class="italic">Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg</span> (1862&#150;82). His approach to travel writing is summarized in a letter of 1864: &#145;Every square-foot of earth has its story, and tells it, too &hellip; one only has to be willing to listen to its voices, quiet as they often are&#146;  (letter to Ernst von Pfuel, 18 Jan 1864, <span class="italic">Theodor Fontane: Werke, Schriften und Briefe</span>, 1979, <span class="italic">Briefe</span>, 2.115).<br>
<br>Fontane's translations of ballads from Thomas Percy's <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span>, Joseph S. Moore's <span class="italic">Pictorial Book of Ballads</span>, and Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span> were published as <span class="italic">Balladen</span> in 1861; Fontane also composed a number of original poems on English and Scottish themes between 1842 and 1859. A vast amount of correspondence, diary entries, and journalism, some of it as yet unedited, survives from his years in England.<br>
<br>In 1878 Fontane left government service to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis. Despite recurrent financial difficulties and periods of acute depression, these last two decades of his life proved extraordinarily productive. He wrote no fewer than fifteen novels, as well as poems and travel guides. His masterpieces include <span class="italic">L'adultera</span> (1882; translated as <span class="italic">The Woman Taken in Adultery</span>, 1979), <span class="italic">Irrungen Wirrungen</span> (1888), <span class="italic">Effi Briest</span> (1895; English translation 1967), and <span class="italic">Der Stechlin</span> (published posthumously in 1898).<br>
<br>Fontane's novels draw extensively on his travel writings and diaries. Many are larded with English sayings and expressions, reflecting how English had supplanted French as the fashionable foreign language in late nineteenth-century Prussia. Frequent references to English (and Scottish) culture, fashions, and the ideal of the &#145;gentleman&#146; occur. The British characters in the novels include vignettes such as Mister Nelson, the vapid Liverpudlian merchant in <span class="italic">Frau Jenny Treibel</span> (1893) and the patriotic coachman Mister Johnson in <span class="italic">Der Stechlin</span>. <span class="italic">C&eacute;cile</span> (1887) has a Scottish protagonist, the engineer Major Robert von Leslie-Gordon. In <span class="italic">Der Stechlin</span> the theme of England receives its fictional apotheosis. Although the novel is set in Berlin and Fontane's homeland of Brandenburg, sojourns in and journeys to England figure largely. The younger Stechlin is called as a representative of his regiment to Windsor to meet his commander-in-chief, Queen Victoria. The Barby family, into which he marries, has spent twenty years in London, and attitudes to England and the English form the symbolic yardstick by which the various characters are judged.<br>
<br>Fontane's attitude to Britain changed over the years; the youthful enthusiasm of the army officer in 1844, his love affair with London, and the vivid account of what he saw as the journey of a lifetime, the sixteen days in Scotland, give way in his last letters from England to disillusionment with the London climate. Although he never returned to Britain after 1859, he retained to the end of his life an affection for the English and an interest in their politics. His autobiographical work <span class="italic">Von Zwanzig bis Dreissig</span> (&#145;From twenty to thirty&#146;) includes a retrospective account of his English years, written in 1894&#150;5. It included his observation that: &#145;The most modest people&#151;ludicrously enough, the only modest people&#151;are the English. They do cherish an enormous degree of national pride, but in what they achieve <i>personally</i>, they like to adopt a subordinate position&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographische Schriften</span>, vol. 2, <span class="italic">Von Zwanzig bis Dreissig</span>, 1982, 48). In the last two years of his life Fontane had a lively correspondence with James Morris of London, who sent him English newspapers and magazines. Writing in 1896 Fontane took pleasure in the rise of Keir Hardie: &#145;The bourgeoisie is dreadful, and the nobility and clergy are died-in-the-wool, always the same. The new, better world will only begin with the Fourth Estate&#146;  (letter to James Morris, 22 Feb 1896, <span class="italic">Theodor Fontane: Werke, Schriften und Briefe</span>, 1979, <span class="italic">Briefe</span>, 4.539). Fontane died in Berlin on 20 September 1898, and was buried four days later in the cemetery of the French Reformed church.<br>
