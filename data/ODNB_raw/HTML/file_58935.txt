<span class="headword">Moir,  (James) Reid</span>  (1879&#150;1944), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born at The Elms, Benslow, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, on 13 June 1879, the second son and youngest of five surviving children of Lewis Moir (1843&#150;1912), a tailor, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knowles (1841&#150;1910). He was educated at Northgate School, Ipswich, leaving at sixteen to take up an apprenticeship with his father's outfitters' business in the Butter Market, Ipswich. He was never fully committed to his &#145;chosen&#146; profession.<br>
<br>Moir's &#145;amateur&#146; pursuits in archaeology dominated his adult life. He did not become interested in archaeology until his mid-twenties, but he quickly made a name for himself locally and by 1910 had attracted international attention. In an audacious letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in October of that year he claimed to have found irrefutable human artefacts beneath the East Anglian crag deposits, thus challenging the orthodox view of the antiquity of human beings in Britain and attempting to push it back into the tertiary period. This opinion plunged Moir into a fractious debate that lasted the rest of his life, but which also brought him the support and friendship of Sir Edwin Ray Lankester.<br>
<br>On 3 March 1909 Moir married Mary Frances Moberly, a widow twelve years his senior; she was the daughter of Robert George Penny, an Anglican clergyman. The match was childless, although Mary had a daughter from her previous marriage. What should have been a comfortable life was jeopardized by Moir's neglect of the family business in order to concentrate on his archaeological researches; in 1912 his father actually gave him notice to quit, but died later that same year, leaving Reid instead central to the business's future. However Moir's continued lack of interest did nothing to improve his or its financial situation, both of which steadily declined. He yearned for full-time employment in palaeolithic archaeology, but none was to be had.<br>
<br>Moir was a force in British palaeolithic archaeology for some thirty-five years. He was a prominent figure in the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia and at Ipswich Museum, acting as president for both institutions (1914&#150;15 and 1932&#150;3 and 1929 respectively). During this long career he published some 233 works, his earlier efforts being summarized in <span class="italic">The Antiquity of Man in East Anglia</span> (1927). In 1937 his career was crowned by a coveted fellowship of the Royal Society, and in 1939 he delivered the prestigious Huxley memorial lecture at Imperial College, London. The 1930s also saw an upturn in his domestic affairs, when he was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100 p.a. with an equal sum coming from Ipswich Museum, both for services to archaeology.<br>
<br>Moir's work comprised two distinct elements, one dealing with evidence for pre-crag or tertiary man, the other with more mainstream palaeolithic archaeology. The first, never well received even in his own time, is now almost universally disregarded, his &#145;artefacts&#146; discounted as natural and probably the product of marine environments; but in the second he made some genuine and lasting contributions to knowledge. He made several new discoveries&#151;for example the middle palaeolithic sites at Bramford Road and Constantine Road, Ipswich&#151;and undertook new investigations at important known localities, Hoxne, Brundon, High Lodge, and Foxhall Road being among the most famous. Even here, though, the maverick Moir is never far away. A colleague, the geologist Percy Boswell, depicted him as an ambitious, confrontational man who rushed into a series of over-optimistic and premature statements that simply invited attack: the pre-glacial age of the modern human skeleton from Ipswich, which later proved to be an intrusive burial, to cite but one example. Unfortunately, it is with the wilder claims, especially the pre-crag implements, that Moir is today most often, disparagingly, associated.<br>
<br>Moir died of heart failure and coronary thrombosis on 24 February 1944 at his home, the Mill House, Flatford, East Bergholt, Suffolk.<br>
