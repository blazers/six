<span class="headword">Dafoe,  John Wesley</span>  (1866&#150;1944), <span class="occ">journalist in Canada</span>, was born near Combermere in the Ottawa valley, Upper Canada, on 8 March 1866, the eldest son of a pioneer farmer, Calvin Dafoe, and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of John Elcome, farmer, of nearby Bangor. After attending local schools until the age of fifteen, he became a teacher in one of them. Three years later he was in Montreal learning his way as a reporter for the <span class="italic">Montreal Star</span>, then edited by Hugh Graham (later Lord Atholstan) who tutored him well. As parliamentary correspondent he began to acquire a reputation as political observer and commentator. It gained for him, briefly and perhaps prematurely, the editorship of the fledgeling <span class="italic">Ottawa Journal</span>. He was not a success. He then moved west and for six years he honed his skills with the <span class="italic">Manitoba Free Press</span>. He married Alice Parmelee, daughter of William G. Parmelee, the deputy minister of customs and excise, in Ottawa in 1890. They raised a large family of four daughters and three sons. Dafoe subsequently returned to Montreal in 1892 and edited the <span class="italic">Montreal Herald</span> for three years and then rejoined the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Montreal Star</span>.<br>
<br>By this time Dafoe was a vigorous champion of the Liberal Party and attracted the notice of Clifford Sifton, minister of the interior in the Liberal cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Sifton had acquired control of the <span class="italic">Manitoba Free Press</span> and in 1901 he appointed Dafoe editor. It was the beginning of a long, successful, but occasionally difficult relationship. Sifton was not often in Winnipeg and their full and frequent correspondence is a rich mine of information on Canadian public life. Within a short time the <span class="italic">Free Press</span> was the most influential (and prosperous) newspaper in western Canada, whose interests Dafoe championed with the federal Liberals. Increasingly, he came to see himself as a friendly but not uncritical adviser to government. It led to some odd situations.<br>
<br>As minister of the interior, Sifton initiated a vigorous immigration policy seeking out the peasantry of eastern Europe who, he was convinced, would make the vast Canadian prairies a great breadbasket. Dafoe approved of the economic thrust of the policy but, unlike Sifton, deplored its social consequences. For years he editorialized about the danger of &#145;Balkanizing&#146; Canada and demanded a unilingual school system to neutralize the presumed threat. Similarly, when Sifton campaigned against the proposed reciprocity treaty between Canada and the United States in 1911, Dafoe gave it vigorous support. He was first and always a free-trader, but he had little choice if the <span class="italic">Free Press</span> was to maintain its influence (and income) in western Canada, which Sifton was forced to acknowledge.<br>
<br>Publisher and editor stood firmly together during the First World war. However, when in 1917 Laurier, now leader of the opposition, opposed conscription for overseas service, Dafoe broke with the Liberals and ranged the <span class="italic">Free Press</span> behind a union government pledged to compulsory service. It would be ten years before Dafoe returned to the Liberal fold. In the interval, he gave editorial blessing to the post-war Progressive Party, which represented predominantly western agrarian interests. When the majority of them were absorbed by the Liberals in 1926, Dafoe also returned. But he remained an independent Liberal counsellor, turning down a cabinet post among other offers. He did accept an appointment to the Rowell&#150;Sirois royal commission of 1937&#150;40 which fundamentally reshaped the Canadian confederation.<br>
<br>Dafoe's greatest preoccupation during the 1930s was the worsening situation in Europe. Here he seemed torn. His nationalism drew him more and more to see Canada as a North American country, best free of European (and especially British) entanglements. At the same time, he was perhaps the most vocal exponent in the country of the principle of collective security and the League of Nations. But the ambivalence disappeared when war began in 1939, and the <span class="italic">Free Press</span> gave solid support to the government's war effort. Dafoe remained at his editorial desk until he died after a brief illness, at Winnipeg, on 9 January 1944.<br>
<br>J. W. Dafoe never wished to be anything but a journalist, and he was, arguably, Canada's best. His prose was vigorous and direct rather than elegant; designed to explain and persuade rather than to charm. Secure in his abilities, he surrounded himself with the best young people he could find and for three decades the <span class="italic">Free Press</span> was the most influential newspaper in the country. He cared little for public honours, rejecting a knighthood among others. But he did accept several honorary degrees and served devotedly as chancellor of the University of Manitoba from 1934 until his death. Somehow he found time for private writing; his books included <span class="italic">Over the Canadian Battlefields</span> (1919), <span class="italic">Laurier: a Study in Canadian Politics</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Clifford Sifton in Relation to his Times</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Canada: an American Nation</span> (1935), and he edited <span class="italic">Canada Fights</span> (1941).<br>
