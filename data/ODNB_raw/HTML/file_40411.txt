<span class="headword">Gascoigne,  Charles</span>  (1738?&#150;1806), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was the son of Captain Woodroffe Gascoigne, a member of the Gascoigne family of Parlington, Yorkshire, and his wife, the Hon. Grizel Elphinstone, eldest daughter of Lord Elphinstone. His father was involved in the highland settlement of 1746, but nothing is known about Gascoigne's early life or education. On 22 July 1759, at St Martin's, Birmingham, he married Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40491/', "Samuel Garbett")</script>, ironmaster. They had three daughters. The eldest, Anne (1760&#150;1840), married, first, Thomas Hamilton, seventh earl of Haddington, and, second, Captain James Dalrymple. Mary (1771&#150;1795) married Aleksandr Markovich Poltoratsky in St Petersburg; and Elizabeth (1775&#150;1858) married&#151;also in St Petersburg&#151;George Augustus Polten, the former MP for Leominster.<br>
<br>Gascoigne joined the Carron ironworks, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire, where his father-in-law was a partner, quickly established a reputation as an iron-founder, and became managing director. The Carron Company first produced iron cannon in 1761 and from it the Russian admiralty college ordered, in February 1772, 1000 tons of iron cannon. The first consignment of forty-five guns reached Kronstadt in June 1772 and further orders were sent later in 1772 and in 1773. Difficulties under proof were found with many of the guns and no further orders were dispatched until 1785, by which time the famous carronades, first introduced in 1779, were being manufactured. In addition the Carron Company supplied Russia with a Newcomen steam engine, improved by John Smeaton, for pumping duty at Kronstadt. Both these enterprises led to the emigration of skilled British workers to Russia and established a long tradition of technological transfer. A major problem was that the workers had neither the managerial skills nor the social standing to carry out any major breakthrough. Unsuccessful attempts were made to recruit the engineer James Watt, and also William Small, the latter being a friend of the manufacturer Matthew Boulton and Thomas Jefferson's teacher. The solution to this dilemma proved to be the &#145;seduction&#146; of Charles Gascoigne.<br>
<br>The recruitment of Scots to the Russian navy, both as officers and as educationists, together with a growing colony of instrument makers and other skilled artisans in St Petersburg, created a suitable environment for the diffusion of technology to Russia. The negotiations for Gascoigne's recruitment were carried out, in great secrecy, through the agency of Admiral Sir Samuel Greig, at the instigation of Count A. A. Bezborodko. At the British end the agents were the Russian ambassador, Count S. R. Vorontsov, and the shipbuilder Mikhail Stepanov. Suspicion already existed in the minds of Garbett, Boulton, and others about Russian intentions because of the export of cannon, a copy of Smeaton's model for testing water-power, and other machines from the Carron Company. Nevertheless, the British government, anxious to establish good relations with Russia, allowed these exports to go forward. A few workers were taken off Russian ships and returned to Scotland, but it was with the British government's tacit approval that, in May 1786, Gascoigne and twelve skilled men, including his chief assistant, Adam Armstrong, embarked for Russia.<br>
<br>The move to Russia was also fortuitous for Gascoigne, who had personally become bankrupt and whose shares in the Carron Company were held by creditors. In England he was strongly criticized by Garbett, Boulton, and others, though Boulton's position was always suspect, since he himself was angling for Russian business, first in the ormolu trade and later in the provision of a steam-powered mint for St Petersburg. From the Russian point of view, preparing for a war against Turkey, the provision of cannon that would not explode in the faces of their Russian operators was essential. Greig celebrated Gascoigne's arrival in St Petersburg by writing to Vorontsov to say that he was the man they needed more than anyone else.<br>
<br>Gascoigne was placed in charge of the Olonets factories, near Lake Onega, north-east of St Petersburg. He was to direct the Aleksandrovsk textile manufacture and to establish the Koncherzersky iron foundry. His salary was to be &pound;2500 (25,000 gold roubles) p.a., plus a percentage of the profits from the Olonets complex; he was also to be given complete control of the enterprises. His position at that time, as a private contractor to the Russian government, afforded him excellent opportunities for amassing a fortune.<br>
<br>Within three years Gascoigne was awarded the order of St Vladimir, followed by the order of St Anna (second and then first class). In 1789 a Russian barony was bestowed on him. Not surprisingly, he met with a good deal of envy and suspicion. His second wife was Anastasia-Jessye, daughter of Dr Matthew Guthrie, physician to Tsar Paul; Count F. Golovkin claimed that she became the mistress of Procurator-General P. V. Lopuklim, father of the tsar's favourite  (Bartlett, &#145;Charles Gascoigne&#146;, 355).<br>
<br>The establishment of Henry Cort's process of ironfounding in Britain made it possible to use increased amounts of scrap iron. In 1789 Gascoigne introduced at Kronstadt a foundry using scrap metal, and it was later transferred to St Petersburg to become the basis of the Peterburgsky Liteiny Zavod. Several years later the increased danger of war with Turkey and the need to strengthen Russian defences led to Gascoigne establishing the Lugansk foundry, which began smelting in 1797. As Russia was also interested in the British invention of copper sheathing for the hulls of wooden ships, Gascoigne wanted to learn about the rolling mills that Boulton was bringing over in the 1790s for the steam-powered mint at St Petersburg, as well as the Boulton and Watt steam engines. Every move that &#145;the Baron&#146; made was regarded with suspicion by Boulton's agents, despite the fact that Boulton had promised the disclosure of every part of the mint machinery to the Russian government.<br>
<br>In 1796 Gascoigne established a factory at Petrozavodsk to make buttons for military uniforms, a typical Birmingham manufacture. In 1803 he reorganized the admiralty's Izhora works at Kolpino, south-east of St Petersburg. William Hastie, the architect, was involved in drawing up the plans, as he was for the first metal bridge erected in St Petersburg, also by Gascoigne. In 1805 Gascoigne was made technical director of the Aleksandrovsk manufacture and installed its first steam engine. When John Quincy Adams visited the textile factory in 1810 he found three steam engines there, but it may have been Alexander Wilson, Gascoigne's assistant and successor, who was responsible for them. Much of the ornamental ironwork on buildings in St Petersburg was created in factories directed by Gascoigne. He was a consultant to N. Mordvinov in the 1790s in the reconstruction of the docks at Nikolayev. He also played a large part in the introduction of a new Russian statute on weights and measures, setting the English inch as the basis of the Russian <i>arshin</i>.<br>
<br>Despite later problems with the collapse of the dam at Kolpino and a violent quarrel with A. N. Olenin over the St Petersburg mint, Gascoigne retained government support. The steam engine at the mint, built by George Sheriff under his direction, had to be replaced by Boulton and Watt engines, but such failures were outweighed by Gascoigne's many successes in bringing Russia into the era of industrialization through the introduction of new machines and processes and the attraction of skilled British labour, including Adam Armstrong, George Sheriff, and Charles Baird.<br>
<br>Gascoigne was ambitious, unscrupulous, and self-seeking but he was also energetic, entrepreneurial, and effective. He died at St Petersburg on 1 August 1806 leaving a large fortune.<br>
