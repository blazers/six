<span class="headword">Nevill family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1793&#150;1973), <span class="occ">copper smelters and colliery proprietors</span>, was founded by <a name="cosubject_49079"></a><span class="headword">Charles Nevill</span>  (1753&#150;1813)<span class="occ"></span>, born in May 1753, probably on the 2nd, either at Birmingham or Stafford, the youngest of the seven children of Thomas Nevill (<i>c</i>.1723&#150;<i>c</i>.1783) of Lichfield and his first wife, Elizabeth Parrock, who died soon after his birth. He entered the Birmingham copper trade at a young age, and became recognized as an important Birmingham button maker in the 1780s. He married, first, Sarah Willets (<i>d</i>. 1782) of Rowley Regis, Staffordshire, in 1777, and second, in 1784, Martha (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1821), daughter of Richard Janion of Colchester and widow of William Acton. There were three children from the first marriage, and one son, <a href="#cosubject_49080">Richard Janion Nevill [<i>see below</i>]</a>, from the second. Charles became a shareholder in the Birmingham Mining and Copper Company in the early 1790s, moving to south Wales about 1793 to manage the company's new copper smelting works at Swansea, Glamorgan.<br>
<br>The short sailing distance between copper ore-rich Cornwall and the coastal coalfield of south-west Wales led to most of Britain's copper smelting capacity being concentrated into a small area around Swansea at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the resulting heavy demand on the local collieries causing serious coal supply and cost problems. Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, a small seaport town 12 miles west of Swansea, possessing a proven but undeveloped coalfield, attracted Charles Nevill's attention as a suitable location for a profitable copper smelting enterprise. He entered into partnership with other industrialists to raise the required capital, the company of &#145;Daniell, Savill, Guest, and Nevill, coppersmelters&#146; being formed in March 1805. Nevill quickly took up permanent residence in the town to supervise the construction and commissioning of the Llanelli copperworks and its associated dock. A committed Wesleyan from his early years, he also found time to establish a large Sunday school shortly after his arrival. The company became both a copper smelting and coalmining concern with the purchase of local collieries in 1807. Charles Nevill died at his Llanelli home, Vauxhall House, on 20 November 1813, aged sixty, and was buried in Llanelli churchyard. It was later written of him &#145;it was he made the Copperworks, and the Copperworks made Llanelly&#146;  (Mee, xxxiii) and there is little doubt that his advent had laid the foundations of Llanelli's long-term industrialization.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49080"></a><span class="headword">Richard Janion Nevill</span>  (1785&#150;1856)<span class="occ"></span>, youngest son of Charles, born at Summer Hill, Birmingham, on 22 November 1785, assumed local control of the company on his father's death. In 1812 he married Anne (<i>c</i>.1782&#150;1863), eldest daughter of William Yalden (<i>d</i>. 1810), originally of Lavington, Hampshire, and his wife, Anne, who were resident at Llanelli from about 1784. The Nevills lived at Glanmor House, a newly built house near the copperworks, and there were eight children from the marriage. Richard Janion expanded the copperworks and collieries throughout his years of control, diversifying the company into brass, yellow metal, lead and silver smelting, and shipping; additional industrial interests were acquired outside Llanelli. Changes in partnership led to alterations in the company name&#151;Daniell, Savill, Sons, and Nevill in 1817, Daniell, Son, and Nevill in 1819, Daniell, Nevill &amp; Co. in 1824, and Sims, Willyams, Nevill, Druce &amp; Co. in 1837. The company was responsible for some 13 per cent of Britain's copper production by 1833, making it the nation's joint third largest copper smelting concern, a position it maintained over the following two decades. Separate from the company's affairs, Richard Janion also had personal involvement in banking, industrial shareholding, the timber trade, shipping, land purchase, and mineral leasing, to the extent that it was often difficult to distinguish between his interests and those of the company, clarification of ownership being sought on more than one occasion by his partners. He moved to Llangennech Park, a mansion 5 miles from Llanelli, in 1834, and was appointed a magistrate in 1835 and high sheriff of Carmarthenshire a year later; he was also locally active in support of the Conservative Party at that time.<br>
<br>Richard Janion Nevill suffered a stroke and died at Llangennech Park on 14 January 1856, aged seventy. He was buried on 18 January in Llangennech parish churchyard. At the time of his death the company was still one of Britain's premier copper smelters employing some 550 in its copperworks, and a major coalmining concern employing more than 1000 and responsible for almost 3 per cent of the total production of the south Wales coalfield. Surviving evidence yields a contradictory picture of the person who controlled Llanelli's industrial development for more than forty years. Reported as hot-tempered, and certainly a ruthless man of business employing child labour in his collieries up to 1842, he nevertheless provided aid at personal loss during times of grain shortages, built a large British school, the Copperworks School, for his workmen's children in 1848, and was involved in Anglican church provision and endowment to the time of his death. The attendance at his funeral was unprecedented for Llanelli, some 3000, including most of the company's workforce, forming the procession to the churchyard.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77136"></a><span class="headword">Charles William Nevill</span>  (1815&#150;1888)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of Richard Janion, born at Glanmor House on 7 May 1815, assumed local control on his father's death, having been a partner since 1841. He was educated at Swansea grammar school and Rugby School. He married in 1841 Jane (1820&#150;1894), daughter of David Davies of Swansea, and they lived initially at Glanmor House and, from about 1850, at a newly built residence, Westfa House, in the village of Felin-foel, near Llanelli. Six out of ten children of the marriage survived to adulthood, <a href="#cosubject_77139">Hugh [<i>see below</i>]</a> being the only son. The company's smelting works and collieries flourished during the first two decades of his control, but then steadily contracted under the combined effects of the general decline in Britain's copper and lead smelting industries, caused by previous ore exporting countries starting their own smelting, and the working to exhaustion of the profitable seams at the company's collieries; and he became the first member of his family to preside over a decline in the company's fortunes. Unconnected with changes in partnership, the company name changed to Nevill, Druce &amp; Co. in 1873.<br>
<br>Charles William was particularly active in public life. A magistrate since 1838, he was also deeply involved in the poor-law guardians, the board of health, the harbour commissioners, and the school board. He was a deputy lieutenant of Carmarthenshire, the high sheriff in 1868, and the MP (Conservative) for the Carmarthenshire United Boroughs from 1874 to 1876. Strongly ecumenical in outlook, he supported the provision of nonconformist chapels at Llanelli and helped fund the building of the Anglican church at Felin-foel. At the age of sixty-six ill health confined him to his home, causing his withdrawal from participation in most affairs. He died at Westfa on 7 June 1888 aged seventy-three, and was buried in the graveyard of Felin-foel church.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77137"></a><span class="headword">Richard Nevill</span>  (1817&#150;1892)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son of Richard Janion, became an industrialist in his own right, involved in Llanelli's iron, tinplate, and manufacturing industries for most of his working life. He was born at Glanmor House on 6 June 1817 and educated at Thornbury, near Bristol. He married about 1849 Mary Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1821), daughter of Joseph Willis of Crewkerne, Somerset, and lived at Felin-foel House near his brother's residence of Westfa. There were three children from the marriage. Initially, he joined his father at the Llanelli copperworks but in 1839 left to become a partner in the Wern ironworks, a small foundry originally established at Llanelli by his uncle William Yalden junior. He expanded this into a large concern, known locally as Nevill's foundry, specializing in the manufacture of heavy machinery, works and marine engines, boilers, and other products. He was also involved in the establishment and management of iron and tinplate works in and around Llanelli. He did not particularly involve himself in public affairs, although he acted as a magistrate and was deputy lieutenant of Carmarthenshire and occasional chairman of the poor-law guardians. He was a staunch Conservative and a pillar of the Anglican church, involved with his brother in the establishment of the church at Felin-foel. In later years he suffered from heart problems, and he died suddenly on 5 June 1892, aged seventy-four, while visiting his wife's birthplace at Crewkerne.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77138"></a><span class="headword">William Henry Nevill</span>  (1822&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>, the fifth son of Richard Janion, worked for his father's company for many years before becoming a builder of iron sailing and steam ships. He was born at Glanmor House on 15 September 1822 and educated at Bridgnorth, Shropshire, before joining the company as an assistant to his father. About 1857 he married Rachel Louisa Fry of Woodford, Essex, a granddaughter of Elizabeth Fry the reformer and philanthropist. They lived initially at Llangennech Park, then moved to Ferryside, some 12 miles from Llanelli, in 1870. There were six children from the marriage.<br>
<br>His family's long experience of shipping and metalliferous industry undoubtedly led William Henry into shipbuilding at a time when iron was replacing wood in ship construction, and in 1852 he took over an existing shipyard and invested in his brother Richard's ironworks, the Old Lodge, which supplied plates and other iron products to the yard. Considerable investment was made, but little appears to have been produced in the way of ships in the 1850s and substantial losses must have resulted. Shipbuilding ceased and he became a junior partner in his father's company, acting as manager of the Cambrian lead and silver works which had commenced smelting in 1848. Shipbuilding was restarted on a much larger scale in 1863 at a time of expansion and prosperity in national and local trade, with the ships initially supplied to a new company, the Llanelly Iron Shipping Co. Ltd, in which he and his brothers Charles William and Richard were substantial investors. At least twenty-three sailing ships and two steamships were built to Lloyd's highest classification over the following decade, ten of the sailing ships being purchased by the new company. Unfortunately, the boom shipping market of the 1860s soon slumped and there was little demand for well-built, but expensive, sailing vessels from the smaller shipyards. William Henry withdrew from shipbuilding, selling the yard in 1874 and closing the Old Lodge ironworks two years later.<br>
<br>A talented person with a number of diverse patents to his name, William Henry had been unsuccessful in his business life, facing bankruptcy on two separate occasions and being kept from insolvency by his brothers at considerable cost to the family's finances. He died of heart failure at his home, Robert's Rest, Ferryside, on 8 September 1894, aged seventy-one.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77139"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Nevill</span>  (1855&#150;1924)<span class="occ"></span>, the only son of Charles William, born at Westfa House on 9 March 1855, was educated at Winchester College and at Oxford. In 1886 he married Maud (<i>b</i>. 1858/9), daughter of Frederick Elkington of Wolverley, Worcestershire, but previously a copper smelter at Burry Port, near Llanelli. There were no children from the marriage. Involved in the company since his father's health failed in the early 1880s, Hugh was admitted as managing partner in 1889 but found himself presiding over a declining concern. Copper smelting ceased in 1894, subsequent activity concentrating on small-scale refining and the manufacture of copper sheets, plates, and wire; the lead and silver works closed in 1896, and the last remaining colliery was abandoned in 1907. The company's dock and local railway system were separated from the parent concern in 1911 with the formation of Nevill's Dock and Railway Ltd, the company itself becoming Nevill, Druce &amp; Co. Ltd in 1920. Unlike his father, Hugh hardly involved himself in public life, acting only as a magistrate. He left his home at Burry Port to live in Cobham, Surrey, shortly before his death from heart disease in a London clinic on 14 January 1924, aged sixty-eight.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77140"></a><span class="headword">Richard Austin Nevill</span>  (1867&#150;1946), son of William Henry, born at Llangennech Park on 24 September 1867, married about 1896 Gertrude Emily (1869&#150;1958), daughter of William Roderick of Llanelli and his wife, Maria. There were three daughters and one son, <a href="#cosubject_77141">Charles William [<i>see below</i>]</a>, from the marriage. He qualified as a mining engineer and was appointed manager of the Llanelli copperworks in 1894. The natural family successor to his childless cousin Hugh, he was admitted to the partnership in 1913, but then spent the duration of the First World War on active service, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel and being awarded the DSO for gallantry in the Dardanelles. He became managing director of the two limited companies after his cousin's death in 1924 and set about rationalizing operations, closing the refineries and hot rolling mills, and concentrating on the cold rolling of copper plates and the drawing of electrical wire. Active in public life, he was awarded the territorial decoration for his involvement in the Territorial Army, and was chairman of the Llanelli magistrates, a member of the governing body of the Church in Wales, and also a committed Rechabite who often lectured members of his workforce on the evils of drink. He was made a freeman of the borough of Llanelli in 1923 and acted as a deputy lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. He died of heart failure at his home, Brondeg, Ferryside, on 11 January 1946, aged seventy-eight.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77141"></a><span class="headword">Charles William Nevill</span>  (1907&#150;1973)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Richard Austin, born at Ferryside on 16 August 1907, was the last member of his family involved in the town's industrial and public life. Educated at Clifton College, Bristol, he married in 1947 Philippa (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of Captain H. P. Farrell of Karachi, India. He joined the company in 1925 and was appointed a director just before the start of the Second World War. During war service he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, was mentioned in dispatches, and was appointed OBE. He became chairman and managing director of the two limited companies on his father's death in 1946. The dock closed in 1951, and the copperworks became a copper wire and cable manufacturing subsidiary of a national company in 1961, although both Nevill's Dock and Railway Ltd and Nevill, Druce &amp; Co. Ltd continued in existence, with Charles William remaining as their lifelong principal. Active in public life, he was a magistrate, became lord lieutenant of Carmarthenshire in 1967, and was made honorary colonel of the 4th (volunteer) battalion of the Royal regiment of Wales in 1972. He suffered a stroke shortly before Christmas 1972 and died at Llanelli General Hospital on 2 January 1973, aged sixty-five; his death marked the end of his family's 168 years of continuous involvement in Llanelli's industrial life.<br>
<br>The Nevill family was instrumental in ensuring that Llanelli developed into a major centre of heavy industry. The first Charles Nevill and his son Richard Janion were the leading participants, building an industrial empire of national importance which attracted other investors and businesses to the town. The family's long-term commitment to the area provided stability of employment through many difficult periods, the company's reputation as considerate employers by the standards of the day being reflected in particularly good labour relations. The working to exhaustion of the company's coalfield and the adherence to obviously declining copper and lead interests in the late nineteenth century, when steel and tinplate manufacturing were becoming the staple industries of south Wales, hastened the family's economic decline and ensured its eventual disappearance from the industrial life of the region.<br>
