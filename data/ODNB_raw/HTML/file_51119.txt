<span class="headword">Foulds,  John Herbert</span>  (1880&#150;1939), <span class="occ">composer and author</span>, was born on 2 November 1880 at 49 Dorset Street, Hulme, Manchester, one of the four children of Fred Foulds, a bassoonist, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greenwood, who were both members of the Plymouth Brethren. Self-educated musically, yet later an apprentice conductor to Hall&eacute;, Richter, Nikisch, Mahler, and Lamoureux, Foulds initially earned a living as an orchestral cellist in the Hall&eacute; Orchestra from 1900 to 1914 and as a practical all-round musician, lecturing, playing, arranging music, and teaching, while constantly composing music.<br>
<br>Foulds was soon regarded as an efficient and charming light-music composer&#151;the <span class="italic">Lament</span> from the <span class="italic">Keltic Suite</span> (1911) remained popular long after his death&#151;and he wrote much incidental music for contemporary plays, including Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> (1924). Despite championship by Granville Bantock, Elgar, and Richter, Foulds's serious works fared less well, though in 1906 Henry Wood conducted a successful Proms performance of his symphonic poem <span class="italic">Epithalamium</span>. Meanwhile he reacted against his strict religious upbringing by showing a growing interest in theosophy and the occult, which was reflected in his music; for instance, the score of the symphonic poem <span class="italic">Mirage</span> (1910) is headed by a representation of the occult symbol of a pentagram.<br>
<br>In 1909 Foulds married a Llandudno girl, Maud Woodcock; they had a son, Raymond, in 1911. Then in 1915 he met the charismatic violinist Maud MacCarthy (1882&#150;1967), who shared his theosophical interests but broke up his marriage. After a period of living together they married and had a son, Patrick, and a daughter, Marybride. Maud MacCarthy was a pioneer ethnomusicologist, played many Indian instruments, and was able to pitch precisely the twenty-three <i>srutis</i>, or microtonal intervals, characteristic of Indian music. These skills influenced Foulds's experiments with quarter-tones and non-Western modes, and her profound knowledge of Indian spiritual beliefs strengthened his esoteric convictions.<br>
<br>The turning point in Foulds's life was conducting the first performance of his <span class="italic">A World Requiem</span> (1919&#150;21) on armistice night 1923 to an emotional audience in a packed Albert Hall. Encouraged by the British Legion, it was repeated annually until 1926, when it was boycotted inexplicably by both concert promoters and the emergent BBC; by the late twentieth century it had not been performed in its entirety since. Unfortunately public enthusiasm was countered by critical disdain, and there is evidence that there was a jealous conspiracy against the work, possibly because its immediate popularity was distrusted by the musical establishment; it was known in the Foulds family as the &#145;Wreck 'Em&#146;. Its relegation undermined Foulds's confidence; he fled to Paris, where he earned a living as a cinema organist before returning to London in 1930.<br>
<br>In 1935 the whole family moved to India, and Foulds joined his wife in collecting Indian folk music. From 1937 he worked for All-India Radio while learning to play Indian instruments, and he formed an Indo-European orchestra, hoping to further his aim of a synthesis of Eastern and Western music. This goal was never realized, for he died suddenly of cholera in Calcutta on 25 April 1939.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Foulds had become increasingly convinced of the occult nature of musical inspiration, maintaining that sections of <span class="italic">A World Requiem</span> and the prophetically minimalist piano piece <span class="italic">Gandharva-Music</span> (1915) were clairaudiently heard. In his lively and provocative book <span class="italic">Music To-Day op 92</span> (1934) he discussed the occult effect of quarter-tones, which he first used in 1898, then later in <span class="italic">Mirage</span>, <span class="italic">A World Requiem</span>, and the fine and idiomatic <span class="italic">Quartetto intimo</span> (1931&#150;2) and other works. He felt that another way for composers to break away from Western diatonicism lay in experimenting with Indian modes. He demonstrated their effectiveness in the set of piano pieces <span class="italic">Essays in the Modes</span> (1920&#150;27), the piano concerto <span class="italic">Dynamic Triptych</span> (1929), and the orchestral <span class="italic">Three Mantras</span> (1919&#150;30), which had served as preludes to each act of his lost opera <span class="italic">Avatara</span>.<br>
<br>Foulds's interests were alien to the English musical culture of the inter-war years, and his compositions thus remained largely unperformed until the 1980s, when they enjoyed a modest revival of interest. In 1998 an enormously enthusiastic response to a Proms performance of the <span class="italic">Three Mantras</span> seemed to indicate that Foulds's multicultural concerns were more relevant to late twentieth-century audiences than to those of his own time.<br>
