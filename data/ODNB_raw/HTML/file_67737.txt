<span class="headword">Aston, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1600&#150;1646), <span class="occ">apologist of the Church of England and local politician</span>, was born on 29 September 1600 at Aston near Runcorn, Cheshire, the eldest son of John Aston (<i>d</i>. 1615) and his wife, Maude Needham. The Aston family had a long history of service to the crown and Cheshire since the time of Henry II. Thomas's father was a Cheshire gentleman and courtier, rising to become sewer to James I's wife, Queen Anne; his mother was the daughter of Robert Needham of Sherton in Shropshire. Aston inherited the family estate upon his father's death in 1615. He was educated at Macclesfield grammar school and went to Oxford in 1617, matriculating from Brasenose College. He graduated BA in 1619 and in 1626&#150;7 appears to have begun study for the bar at Lincoln's Inn; in any event his legal education was cut short when he was called home to tend to family business. His first wife, <a name="cosubject_67737"></a><span class="headword">Magdalene Aston <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Poultney]</span></span>, Lady Aston  (<em>d.</em> 1635)<span class="occ"></span>, was the daughter of Sir John Poultney of Misterton in Leicestershire and married Aston in 1627; they had four children, all of whom died very young. She died, to Aston's great distress, in 1635 and was buried in the newly renovated Aston chapel. Sir Thomas commissioned a portrait by John Souch now entitled <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Aston at the Deathbed of his Wife</span>. The picture, which is one of the finest examples of the <i>memento mori</i> of the era, currently hangs in the Manchester City Galleries. A memorial in the Aston chapel, probably written by Sir Thomas himself, reads &#145;Heere, reader, in this sad but glorious cell, Of death lyes shrind a double miracle, Of woman and of wyfe, and each soe best, Shee may be fame's fayre copy to the rest&#146;.<br>
<br>Like his father Aston was a courtier, and was created a baronet in July 1628; by 1635 he had risen to become one of the gentlemen-extraordinary of the king's privy chamber. Yet his main role was as a Cheshire gentleman. He was the county's high sheriff in 1635&#150;6, collecting the controversial levy of ship money from the county. He used this odious task to gain local support by fighting an ill-fated action against the corporation of Chester, which claimed exemption from the levy. This action was personally costly, Aston being taxed for his wine business in the city by the vengeful city burghers. He refused to pay the &pound;5 owed, with the result that he lost the favour of the king when the action was taken before the privy council in 1638. His resistance nevertheless made him a hero in the county of Cheshire. For creating support in his political heartland he has been described as an &#145;astute navigator in the treacherous currents of the Personal Rule&#146;  (Maltby, 135). However, Aston's connection with the court was not lost, as his younger brother, John, remained close to the king, acting as his agent in Scotland during the bishops' wars. In 1637 Sir Thomas had married again, his second wife being Anne Willoughby, the only child of Sir Henry Willoughby of Risley in Derbyshire. They had three children together: a son, Willoughby, and two daughters, Magdalene and Mary.<br>
<br>When the war with the Scots forced Charles I to call a parliament in 1640 Aston stood for election with his later enemy Sir William Brereton against Sir George Booth and Sir Richard Wilbraham. Aston and Brereton had the support of Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Kilmorey and were thus chosen to represent Cheshire in the Short Parliament. Aston was not, however, reselected for the Long Parliament in October 1640, as Lord Cholmondeley's brother-in-law, Peter Venebles, was selected in his place. The religious grumblings of the Long Parliament reveal Aston's affection for the liturgy and government of the Elizabethan and Jacobean Church of England. He is seen as a model representative of the conservative conformist gentlemen who were against the liturgical and structural changes of Archbishop Laud but feared the new wave of reformation hoped for by the pro-presbyterian clergy in London. Aston was instrumental in organizing a petition of 6000 names presented to the House of Lords in February 1641 defending the episcopalian government of the Church of England. This petition was a reaction to the root and branch petition and the puritan ministers' petitions that were organized to call for the abolition of the episcopalian order. Aston's actions provoked Sir William Brereton to present a counter-petition said to represent the views of 12,000 of the county of Cheshire against the bishops. In reality Brereton's petition was spurious, though it prompted Aston to organize a second but on this occasion equally spurious petition in response; for this he was called before the bar of the House of Lords in April 1641 to explain his actions.<br>
<br>Aston's main work in the debate on the future of the Church of England was published in May 1641. This 200-page book, entitled <span class="italic">A Remonstrance, Against Presbitery</span>, was written to support the episcopate, the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, the ordained ministry, and the Elizabethan liturgy. Aston revealed himself to be an able lay theologian, quoting widely from the early church fathers, the continental Reformed theologians, and English historical sources to show that the church had always appointed presidential bishops to govern the local priesthood and to prevent schism. He sought to counteract the arguments of influential presbyterians such as the eponymous Smectymnuus, who argued that the title of bishop and presbyter were synonymous in scripture, and that episcopacy was a usurpation of the divine warranted order in the church. Aston believed that presbyterianism would &#145;pull down 26 Bishops and set up 9324 potential Popes&#146;  (Aston, <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>, section 5), and that the office of lay elders would create a clerical tyranny that would destroy the very fabric of the English social and political order. He did not, however, entirely blame the reformist puritans for the problems in the Church of England. The <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>, as well as Aston's private manuscripts, indicate that he blamed much of the church's troubles on the innovations imposed on Britain by bishops led by Laud. Sir Thomas went so far as to state that the Laudian bishops &#145;entrench upon our Liberties, negligently starve the flock [and] covetously engrosse the means of faithfull Labourers&#146;  (ibid., section 18).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Remonstrance, Against Presbitery</span> brought Aston the national reputation of a defender of the Elizabethan and Jacobean settlement. As such he appealed to many in all ranks of English society that were satisfied with the protestantism of the English church. His struggle against presbyterianism and for the primitive episcopacy of Elizabeth's time even earned him eulogies from a number of hack poets. However, the summer and autumn of 1641 saw the presbyterians winning the battle for hearts and minds in London, and Aston decided to present a genuine petition from his county supporting the prayer book. For this petition he regained the support of the king, who wrote a letter sponsoring it. Aston's petition was presented to the House of Lords on 21 December 1641 and contained 9000 genuine signatures from all ranks of men in Cheshire. Perhaps to capitalize on the success of this petition, he published <span class="italic">A Collection of Sundry Petitions Presented to the Kings most Excellent Majestie</span> in summer 1642 reproducing the petitions sent to parliament in defence of episcopacy and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Aston's publications were key in transforming &#145;parochial anxieties into national movement&#146;  (Maltby, 177). However, his introduction to the <span class="italic">Collection</span> shows him to be a man fearful of the popular success of the presbyterian and other anti episcopalian movements, and is a tragic reminder of how England rapidly slid into civil war.<br>
<br>When in autumn 1642 war did break out, Aston campaigned to raise forces in Cheshire for Charles I. He fought at Edgehill, earning commendation by rescuing the bishop of Salisbury from the parliamentarian forces. In reward Charles appointed Aston his major-general in Cheshire. He lost to his old running-mate Sir William Brereton at the battle of Middlewich on 13 March 1643 and was involved in the battle of Nantwich on 25 January 1644. The defeat at Middlewich cost Aston his command of Cheshire's forces. At the behest of Orlando Bridgeman, the king appointed Sir Nicholas Byron as colonel-general of Cheshire. It is likely that Bridgeman's obsession with the city of Chester and his refusal to supply Aston with troops were the key reasons for Aston's defeat and humiliation. After Middlewich Aston joined Sir William Vaughan's forces in the Welsh marches. The aim of this force was to hector the parliamentarian troops besieging Chester; Vaughan's army was, however, ineffectual, being defeated by Brereton at Denbigh. Aston and his troops were scattered and were involved in minor actions until the battle of Bridgnorth in November 1645. This battle proved to be Aston's nemesis, and he was wounded and captured. He died from his wounds in a parliamentarian prison in Stafford in March 1646. Aston was buried at his beloved Aston chapel, and his son and heir erected a monument to him in 1697; the epitaph remembered that he had &#145;distinguished himself both by his learning and his courage in the defence of the church and state&#146;.<br>
