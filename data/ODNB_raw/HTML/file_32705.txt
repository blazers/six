<span class="headword">Dane, Sir  Louis William</span>  (1856&#150;1946), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born on 21 March 1856 at Chichester, where his father, Richard Martin Dane (1813&#150;1901), was an army staff surgeon; he later became an inspector-general of hospitals. His mother was Sophia Eliza, daughter of Colonel Charles Griffiths who served in the First Anglo-Afghan War, and granddaughter of Henry Griffiths, a close friend in India of Warren Hastings. The Dane family had long dwelt in co. Fermanagh and, although Dr Dane moved to England, he nevertheless sent Louis, who was his fifth son, and an elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54358/', "Sir Richard Morris Dane")</script>, to Dr Stackpole's school, Kingstown, Dublin. Both in turn then entered the Indian Civil Service. Louis passed the examination in 1874 and in 1876 was posted to the Punjab [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>]. As assistant commissioner in Dera Ghazi Khan he ensured supplies for the Pishin column in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80). In 1879 he became private secretary to Sir Robert Egerton, lieutenant-governor of the Punjab. He had a successful spell as a settlement officer at Gurdaspur and Peshawar. His brother Richard had served in the former location before him. In 1898 Dane was appointed chief secretary to the Punjab government. On 21 March 1882 he had married Edith (<i>d</i>. 1948), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35250/', "Sir Francis Booth Norman")</script>. They were to have four daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>In 1900 Dane went on leave and seemed to have ended his Indian career, for he became resident magistrate of Tralee, co. Kerry. In November 1901 however he was recalled to India by Lord Curzon to become resident of Kashmir, and in March 1903 foreign secretary in the government of India. Curzon was especially concerned over Afghan affairs. In 1901 Amir Habibullah had succeeded his father, Abdur Rahman, whose reign of twenty years had been marked by friendship with India, although at its end certain issues were unsettled. In October 1904 Dane headed a mission to Kabul where he gained the young amir's respect. Negotiations were too protracted for the forceful viceroy who wanted to withdraw the mission, but Dane, dissenting, held that the amir's renewal of his father's engagements should be accepted as sufficient. The cabinet in London supported Dane and the treaty was signed in March 1905. Dane, who had been appointed CSI in 1904, was now made a KCIE. The value of his achievement became clear in the First World War when, despite persistent German pressure, Habibullah maintained his country's neutrality in the face of domestic dangers which were tragically underlined by his assassination in 1919.<br>
<br>In 1908 Dane became lieutenant-governor of the Punjab. This was a difficult period following the widespread rural disturbances the previous year. It fell to Dane to oversee the enactment in 1912 of the <span class="roman">Punjab Colonization of Land Bill</span>. An earlier ill-judged version of the legislation had caused the 1907 disturbances. His tireless energy in touring his province set a high example to his officers. His linguistic gifts and handsome presence helped to win him general respect and public confidence. In December 1911 he was called upon to arrange the memorable people's fair at the royal durbar. He was promoted GCIE and, exactly a year later, had to hand over to the government of India the Delhi district as part of the enclave of the new capital. The viceroy, Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, was seriously wounded on his way to the ceremony which nevertheless took place. In this emergency, Dane, after his formal speech, &#145;laid aside the typescript&#146;, wrote his contemporary Sir Henry Sharp, &#145;and began to talk [in Urdu] &hellip;. It swept through the audience like a strong wind. Formality melted in emotion.&#146; In May 1913 Dane's successful period as lieutenant-governor of the Punjab ended and he retired to London.<br>
<br>After his retirement Dane continued to take an active interest in Indian affairs and was for many years on the board of the Attock Oil Company. On 13 March 1940, at a joint meeting of the East India Association and Royal Central Asian Society, he was badly wounded in the arm by the assailant who killed Sir Michael O'Dwyer. He was then nearly eighty-four, and lived to be almost ninety, dying at his home, 24 Onslow Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 22 February 1946. The youngest of his sons, Henry, died in captivity in Japan in 1942 and was posthumously appointed to the DSO in 1946.<br>
