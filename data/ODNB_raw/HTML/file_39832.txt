<span class="headword">Grigson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McIntire]</span>,  (Heather Mabel) Jane</span>  (1928&#150;1990), <span class="occ">writer on cookery</span>, was born on 13 March 1928 in Gloucester, the elder daughter (there were no sons) of George Shipley McIntire (1897&#150;1990), deputy town clerk of Gloucester, and his wife, Doris Mabel Frampton Berkley 1899&#150;1988, artist. When she was four her father became town clerk of Sunderland, and he bequeathed quietly left-wing politics to his daughters. It was the good fresh fish and the straightforwardness of north country food that first delighted Jane in her lifetime's study. In 1939 Wearside was a target for German bombing, and she and her sister were sent to Casterton School (originally for clergy daughters) in Westmorland, where Jane encountered the outstanding English teaching of a Miss Bevis. In 1946 she went to Cambridge, where she attended Newnham College. She obtained a third class in part one of the English tripos (1948) and a second (division two) in part two (1949).<br>
<br>Jane McIntire's first job was at Heffer's Art Gallery in Cambridge. In 1953 she went to work for the publisher Rainbird, McLean, who recommended her as research assistant to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31176/', "Geoffrey Edward Harvey Grigson (1905&#150;1985)")</script> for his series of separate books <span class="italic">People, Places, Things, and Ideas</span> (4 vols., 1954). She had bought his anthology <span class="italic">Visionary Poems and Passages, or, The Poet's Eye</span> (1944) when she was fifteen. Grigson was the son of William Shuckforth Grigson, vicar of Pelynt, Cornwall. He was twenty-three years older than Jane, had been married twice before, and had three grown-up or adolescent children. They lived together and in the mid-1950s she changed her name by deed poll to Grigson; twenty years later they were able to marry. They had one daughter, Sophie, who also became a cookery expert. They lived partly at Broad Town Farm House, Broad Town, near Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, and partly in France, at Tr&ocirc;o, in the Loir valley. In both places they absorbed the landscape and history, and gave news of them in different literary forms.<br>
<br>Jane Grigson's first published writing was for the <span class="italic">Sunderland Echo</span>, a piece on Bede. She made a new translation (1959) of Carlo Collodi's <span class="italic">Pinocchio</span>, and one of Cesare Beccaria's <span class="italic">Dei delitti e delle pene</span> (as <span class="italic">Of Crimes and Punishments</span>, 1963), for which she jointly won the John Florio prize. She found her true vocation when a reader of Geoffrey Grigson's book <span class="italic">Painted Caves</span> (1957) wrote to him from Tr&ocirc;o, asking if he knew of that semi-troglodyte village. They went to see, and soon bought their own habitable cave. Jane Grigson had started as Geoffrey's amanuensis, but in Tr&ocirc;o she emerged as her own writer. The variety and excellence of the local raw materials, the skills of their neighbours, and her own developing conviction that because cooking is a central part of life it should be as carefully written about as any other art form, led to the first of her many books: <span class="italic">Charcuterie and French Pork Cookery</span> (1967). This was a breakthrough into a new literacy about cooking, and she was immediately recognized as a serious writer. Later landmark books were <span class="italic">Fish Cookery</span> (1973, enlarged as <span class="italic">Jane Grigson's Fish Book</span>, 1993), which restored fish cookery to its rightful place, and <span class="italic">English Food</span> (1974). The tiny <span class="italic">Cooking of Normandy</span> (1987), written for sale at Sainsbury's, raised that often footling genre to a new level.<br>
<br>From 1968 until the week of her death Jane Grigson wrote for the <span class="italic">Observer Magazine</span>, to which Elizabeth David had recommended her. Several of her books were collections of articles. She campaigned against the bad as well as for the good, denouncing the degradation and sometimes danger inflicted on eaters by food adulterators in general. Elizabeth David awoke post-war Britain from its devotion to oversized and overcooked food, and Jane Grigson carried the awakening forward by opening the whole wide history and context of foods, dishes, utensils, and methods. Above all she sought to, and did, convey the reliable pleasures of knowledgeable cooking and eating. She herself put it:<blockquote>Cooking something delicious is really much more satisfactory than painting pictures or throwing pots. Food has the tact to disappear, leaving the room and opportunity for masterpieces to come. The mistakes don't hang on the walls or stand on the shelves to reproach you for ever.</blockquote>Jane Grigson was generous, scholarly, and deeply cheerful, combining outgoingness with equanimity; she was also smoothly and unobtrusively beautiful, with wavy fair hair and green eyes. When already terminally ill, she spoke and raised funds to fight off threats from developers to the great neolithic monument at Avebury near her Wiltshire home. She died of cancer at Broad Town on 12 March 1990 and was buried in Christ Church churchyard there beside her husband, who had died in 1985. Her collection of cookery books became the core of the Jane Grigson Library at the Guildhall Library in the City of London.<br>
