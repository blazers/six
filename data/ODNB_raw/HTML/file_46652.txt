<span class="headword">Weatherly,  Frederic Edward</span>  (1848&#150;1929), <span class="occ">songwriter and barrister</span>, was born on 4 October 1848 at 7 Woodhill, Portishead, near Bristol, the eldest son in the large family of Frederick Weatherly (1820&#150;1910), a country doctor, and his wife, Julia Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ford (1823&#150;1898). He was educated at Hereford Cathedral School (1859&#150;67) and admitted with a scholarship at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1867. Walter Pater was his tutor. Being small and slight he made a useful cox for the college boat. Despite poor examination results he secured a college exhibition, took his BA degree in 1871 (MA 1874), and remained in Oxford, briefly as a schoolmaster, and then as a drudging university &#145;coach&#146; and author of textbooks on logic. On 31 December 1871 he married Anna Maria Hardwick (<i>d</i>. 1920), and they had a son and two daughters. They later lived apart. Weatherly left teaching to qualify as a barrister at the Inner Temple in 1887 and moved to London. In 1893 he joined the western circuit, living first at Clifton and from 1900 at Bath, busy in his profession until the end of his life. With Edward Cutler he published <span class="italic">The Law of Musical and Dramatic Copyright</span> (1890). On 2 August 1923 he married a widow, Mrs Miriam Bryan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies (<i>d</i>. 1941). He was appointed king's counsel in 1925.<br>
<br>Although he competed unsuccessfully for the Newdigate prize three times, as an undergraduate Weatherly published poems and his first song lyrics, and they were followed during his years at Oxford by two novels, many children's books, and librettos for cantatas and oratorios. In devising texts for music he found a talent in which he was fluent and lucky from the start, and came to have no rival. Weatherly wrote the words of many of the most popular songs in the English-speaking world for half a century, in association with composers such as Molloy, Cowen, Tosti, Michael Maybrick (Stephen Adams), and Coates. His songs were performed by the leading singers of three generations. Although he seldom wrote for existing music, he took pains in translating Italian and French opera, and his versions of <span class="italic">Cavalleria rusticana</span> (1892) and <span class="italic">I pagliacci</span> (1893) have lasted. He did not claim that his lyrics were fine poetry, nor pretend to musical ability beyond a good ear, but he felt strongly that the words of a ballad were as important as its setting, as their author was the equal of the composer. He was alert to changing tastes and versatile in several styles from the patriotic and naval to the humorous, religious, rustic, and sentimental. Inevitably he attracted parodists who reflected his success; this itself depended on the popularity of ballad concerts promoted by music publishers that created a vast lucrative market for sheet music for home entertainment. William Boosey, the music publisher, remembered him as &#145;certainly the most prolific lyric writer and the happiest in his ideas&#146;  (Boosey, 84). He was described as &#145;always a cheery, happy, good-humoured little man&#146;  (R. W. J., 13).<br>
<br>For many years Weatherly gave lively, anecdotal lectures on his craft, illustrating, for example, the need to &#145;get a point at the end of each verse, and the best point in the last&#146;  (Weatherly, 166). The advent of recording and later of radio kept his songs alive, and in the 1920s he broadcast for the BBC. Unashamed of popularity and prosperity, he had no patience with musical snobbery that equated popular songs with want of artistry or scorned a good melody. A jubilee dinner was held in his honour in London in December 1919. Weatherly lost count of his songs, but claimed to have published more than 1500. Dozens of them were extremely popular in his lifetime, and a number, including <span class="italic">Nancy Lee</span> (1876), <span class="italic">The Holy City</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Danny Boy</span> (1912) to the &#145;Londonderry Air&#146;, and <span class="italic">Roses of Picardy</span> (1916) set by Haydn Wood, survived him. Weatherly's autobiography, <span class="italic">Piano and Gown</span>, in which he glossed over unhappy parts of his life, appeared in 1926. He died at his home, Bathwick Lodge, Bath, after a short illness on 7 September 1929 and was buried four days later in Bathwick cemetery. A memorial tablet was unveiled in Bath by Clara Butt in 1931.<br>
