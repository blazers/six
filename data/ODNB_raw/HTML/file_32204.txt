<span class="headword">Busk,  Rachel Harriette</span>  (1831&#150;1907), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born at 22 Cumberland Street, London, the youngest of the five daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4169/', "Hans Busk the elder (1772&#150;1862)")</script>, scholar and poet, and his wife, Maria (1788&#150;1840), daughter of Joseph Green. An elder sister of Rachel's was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4271/', "Mrs Julia Clara Byrne (1819&#150;1894)")</script>, wife of the editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4170/', "Hans Busk the younger (1815&#150;1882)")</script> was the elder of her two brothers. Rachel Busk was educated by her father, and from an early age she spent much time in foreign travel, becoming an excellent linguist. Brought up as a protestant, she joined the Roman Catholic church in 1858, an enthusiastic convert of H. E. Manning (later second archbishop of Westminster), and her example was later followed by her four sisters.<br>
<br>Rachel Busk lived much at Rome from 1862 onwards, and gained an intimate knowledge of the city and of society there in the days of papal independence. Among her wide circle of friends was Cardinal Giacchino Pecci, afterwards Pope Leo XIII. She contributed a series of letters on Roman politics and society to the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> (a weekly Roman Catholic paper that ran from February 1859 until April 1879); some of these were reprinted in 1870 in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Contemporary annals of Rome: notes political, archaeological and social, with a preface by Monsignor Capel</span>. Her reports covered Garibaldi's invasion of Rome, and the calling of the general council (known as the First Vatican Council, 1869&#150;70), including an account of Manning's attendance.<br>
<br>Travelling in outlying parts of Italy, Spain, and Austria, Rachel Busk became an authority on folklore, collecting thousands of folk tales and songs by word of mouth. She published anonymously <span class="italic">Patra&ntilde;as, or, Spanish Stories</span> (1870); <span class="italic">Household Stories from the Land of Hofer, or, Popular Myths of Tirol</span> (1871); and <span class="italic">Sagas from the Far East: Kalmouk and Mongol Tales</span> (1873). Under her own name she published <span class="italic">The Folk-Lore of Rome</span> (1874); <span class="italic">The Valleys of Tirol</span> (1874); and <span class="italic">The Folk-Songs of Italy</span> (1887), a well-edited selection, giving a specimen from each province with a line-for-line translation and notes.<br>
<br>The London home shared by Rachel Busk with her sister Julia Pitt Byrne was known for its hospitality, and in 1898 she edited and published material for further volumes of Julia Pitt Byrne's <span class="italic">Gossip of the Century</span>, giving these the title <span class="italic">Social Hours with Celebrities</span>, fittingly called by her &#145;a chronicle of slight incidents&#146;. They contained many reminiscences, autobiographical and biographical. Portraits included one of Nicholas Wiseman (first archbishop of Westminster), who, Rachel Busk claimed, had based the published version of his London lectures on the notes she had taken at his request. Among others of interest were such notable Catholic figures as Charles Waterton, Mrs Fitzherbert, Charles Lavigerie, and Theobald Mathew. Hilaire Belloc dedicated his <span class="italic">The Path to Rome</span> to her in 1902.<br>
<br>Rachel Busk maintained a worldwide correspondence with fellow folklorists, horticulturists, and archaeologists. She died at her residence in Members' Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster, on 1 March 1907, and was buried in the family vault at Frant, near Tunbridge Wells.<br>
