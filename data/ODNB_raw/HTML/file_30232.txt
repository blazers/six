<span class="headword">Yonge, Sir  William</span>, fourth baronet  (<em>c.</em>1693&#150;1755), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Colyton, Devon the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38163/', "Sir Walter Yonge, third baronet (bap. 1653, d. 1731)")</script>, and his second wife, Gwen, the daughter and coheir of Sir Robert Williams. He married Mary, the daughter of Samuel Heathcote of Hackney and the sister of Sir William Heathcote, on 30 July 1716. This marriage, which was childless, ended in an acrimonious divorce in 1724. Yonge secured evidence of his wife's adultery with Colonel Thomas Norton, won a case for damages, and was granted a divorce in the consistory court of the bishop of London and by a special act of parliament which gave him permission to remarry. His second wife, whom he married on 14 April 1729, was Anne, the daughter and coheir of Thomas Howard, sixth Baron Howard of Effingham. The couple had six daughters and two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30223/', "George Yonge, fifth baronet")</script>, later governor of the Cape of Good Hope.<h2>
<a name="MPforHonitonandallyofWalpole"></a>MP for Honiton and ally of Walpole</h2>The Yonge family, who were staunch whigs, owned estates near and in the borough of Honiton. Together with the tory Courtenay family, who were lords of the manor, they dominated the electoral interest of this notoriously venal borough. Yonge was first elected for Honiton in 1715, soon after he came of age, and he represented the borough continuously until 1754, when he surrendered his seat to his son George and took his seat for Tiverton. As well as being elected for Honiton in every general election he was also re-elected in five by-elections required after he had taken office under the crown. Though venal, Honiton was not a pocket borough and it was quite often contested. The franchise originally belonged to all inhabitant householders who paid scot and lot (about 300&#150;400 voters in 1715), but, after a resolution in the House of Commons in 1724, all inhabitant householders were given the vote and the number of electors doubled. Yonge favoured this decision as the leader of the more popular party in the constituency, but he retained his seat by carefully cultivating the voters and spending heavily on his elections.<br>
<br>A firm whig, Yonge always attached himself to the ministerial party. His first reported speech was in support of the government-sponsored <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span> in 1716. During the split in the whig party in 1717 he supported the earl of Sunderland and was rewarded with a minor place in the commission for stating army debts. In a debate on the South Sea scheme, on 23 March 1720, he was one of the ministerial spokesmen who narrowly secured the rejection of Robert Walpole's motion for protecting holders of government loans by fixing the rate at which they might be converted into South Sea stock. After Sunderland's death in 1722 Yonge quickly attached himself to Walpole, becoming a commissioner of Irish revenue 1723&#150;4 and then a lord of the Treasury in 1724. Thereafter he became one of Walpole's most dependable lieutenants in the Commons. He was particularly active in defending the armed forces raised each year by the ministry and the administration's foreign policy. In 1723 he played a major role in the impeachment of Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, and on 27 May 1725 he was created one of the first knights of the Bath.<br>
<br>Yonge lost office in 1727, on the accession of George II. According to Lord Hervey, the new king always referred to him as &#145;Stinking Yonge&#146; and had conceived such an insurmountable dislike to his person and his character that Walpole could not persuade the king to allow him to remain in office. Walpole advised him to &#145;be patient, not clamorous, to submit, not resent or oppose, to be subservient to the Court in attendance and give the King his assistance as constantly and as assiduously in Parliament as if he was paid for it&#146;  (Hervey, 1.35&#150;7). Walpole's advice was heeded and his confidence justified. Yonge was made a lord of the Admiralty in 1728, advanced to a lord of the Treasury in 1730, and served as secretary at war from 1735 to 1746. This last promotion proved that he had overcome the king's aversion to him, because the post gave its holder regular access to the royal closet.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarypoliticianandsecretaryatwar"></a>Parliamentary politician and secretary at war</h2>Yonge amply repaid Walpole's confidence in him. In the Commons he was one of the ministry's most frequent and effective speakers on a very wide range of issues. In addition to his justification of the armed forces, he played a leading role in every major debate when the parliamentary opposition proposed bills designed to reduce crown patronage and the ministry's ability to influence MPs or the electorate. He regularly accused the opposition of pursuing factious policies, of vilifying all the supporters of the ministry including the king and queen, and of undermining the existing balance of the constitution. He repeated these charges in his only pamphlet, <span class="italic">Sedition and Defamation Display'd</span> (1731). Lord Hervey added an introductory dedication to this work that subjected William Pulteney and Lord Bolingbroke to scurrilous abuse. Pulteney's printed reply, even more scurrilous and brutal, led to a famous duel between him and Hervey.<br>
<br>Once the country was at war from 1739, Yonge's burdens increased in weight and importance. As secretary at war he was responsible for recruitment, billeting, the supply of clothes and equipment, convoys, transport, and the care of sick and wounded troops. In parliament it was his primary duty to pilot recruiting bills and army estimates through the Commons. In regularly arguing that Britain must maintain the balance of power in Europe, which meant engaging with French forces on the continent and not merely at sea or in the colonies, he defended the need to employ German mercenaries, to keep Hanoverian troops in British pay, and to maintain a British army in Flanders in wartime.<br>
<br>When Walpole's long administration at last crumbled in the early 1740s, Yonge remained loyal and was determined that the opposition would not profit from the great man's fall. He worked tirelessly to ensure that the ministry safeguarded its reduced majority by persuading the committee of elections to decide disputed returns from the 1741 general election in the ministry's favour. He continued to fight every disputed election return until defeat in the case of Chippenham convinced Walpole of the need to resign.<br>
<br>Even then, Yonge defended the minister from every opposition attempt to inquire into abuses. When, in January 1742, Pulteney moved for a secret committee to examine whatever persons and papers the Commons pleased, Walpole rightly saw it as a malicious attack on himself and defied his critics to accuse him in an open and fair manner. In this major debate both sides brought out their best speakers and Pulteney's motion was defeated by only 253 votes to 250, one of the greatest attendances in the Commons ever recorded and the greatest number that had lost a question. Horace Walpole observed: &#145;When the debate was over, Mr Pultney owned that he had never heard so fine a debate on our side; and said to Sir Robert &#147;well, no body can do what you can!&#148; &#147;Yes&#148;, replied Sir R[obert], &#147;Younge did better&#148;&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 17.299). Yonge repeated his opposition to a committee of inquiry in March 1742, after Walpole's resignation.<br>
<br>The duke of Newcastle and his brother, Henry Pelham, Walpole's chief lieutenants, urged the king not to give way to the opposition after Walpole's fall, but to reconstruct the ministry on much the same basis as before. The king followed this advice and Yonge remained as secretary at war under the ministry dominated by the Pelham brothers. He served this administration much as he had that of Walpole, defending the ministry's demands for troops and its conduct of war and diplomatic negotiations. He also criticized opposition motions to tax places and pensions, to repeal the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span>, and to remove the right of the aldermen of the City of London to veto measures proposed by the more popular common council.<br>
<br>By 1745 the Pelham administration's control of the Commons was insecure and it had to consider augmenting its strength by bringing into office either Henry Fox or William Pitt, or both. There were rumours as early as December 1744 that Yonge would make way for Pitt, who was anxious to occupy his post. The king, however, deeply resented Pitt's earlier scathing comments on Hanover and so refused to have him in a post which gave him so much access to the royal closet. But by May 1746 the Pelhams were able to reconstruct the ministry. Yonge's ill health provided an excuse to transfer him to the less onerous but more lucrative post of joint vice-treasurer for Ireland. Fox replaced Yonge, and Pitt came in as paymaster-general.<br>
<br>Although Yonge was no longer such a prominent member of the ministry, he remained a loyal and reliable supporter of its policies. The 1745 Jacobite rising found him once more defending the settlement of 1688&#150;9 and the Hanoverian succession. He was one of the managers of the impeachment of Lord Lovat and also led a committee of inquiry into the suspected Jacobite sympathies of the independent electors of Westminster. In the impeachment of Lovat, in December 1746, he insisted that the aged Jacobite should be denied the support of counsel, but by May 1747 Yonge himself moved a more generous bill to allow those impeached of treason the full benefit of counsel. In February 1751 he appeared in a different light, however, when he proposed that Alexander Murray, a Jacobite involved in raising a mob in the Westminster by-election of 1750, should be committed to Newgate for contempt of the Commons in refusing to receive a reprimand at the bar of the chamber in a kneeling position.<br>
<br>In his last years in parliament Yonge spoke up in support of Robert Nugent's <span class="roman">Naturalization Bill</span> in February 1751, in opposition to Hardwicke's <span class="roman">Marriage Act</span> in May 1753, and in support of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Act</span> in November of the same year. His last reported speech in the Commons, in December 1753, found him characteristically arguing that parliamentary inquiries into crimes should be used only in the most extreme cases of the abuse of power. The last report of his activities in the house noted his vain efforts in February 1754 to repeal the <span class="roman">Bribery Act</span> ahead of the impending general election. In that election he surrendered his seat at Honiton and, with the support of the ministry, was returned for Tiverton.<h2>
<a name="Politicaltalents"></a>Political talents</h2>Yonge's prime claim to fame as a politician rests on his abilities as a man of business and as one of the most effective speakers on the ministerial side in the Commons. Many contemporaries acknowledged his qualities as a speaker. One report noted that he put forward his arguments &#145;with great vivacity and address&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 8.409). Lord Hervey claimed that &#145;he had no wit in private conversation, but was remarkably quick in taking hints to harangue upon in Parliament&#146;  (Hervey, 1.36). Lord Chesterfield told his son that &#145;Sir William Yonge &hellip; has, by a glibness of tongue singly, raised himself successively to the best employments of the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 5.2084). Yonge himself once boasted: &#145;I never speak but what I dare express my meaning and speak boldly what I mean&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Diary of Sir Edward Knatchbull</span>, 146).<br>
<br>The many reports of Yonge's speeches confirm that he was an effective speaker, but his parliamentary talents went beyond this. When Walpole did not care to enter early into a debate himself, he sometimes gave Yonge his notes, when the latter came into the Commons, from which Yonge would speak fluently and effectively, even though he had missed all the preceding discussion. When Walpole was reluctant to support a measure too openly, he deployed Yonge's talents instead. Thus Yonge led the ministerial side in support of the controversial <span class="roman">Quaker Tithe Bill</span> in 1736, while other ministers kept silent, and he spoke and voted in May 1737 against the motion to reduce the rate of interest on the national debt, while Walpole baffled the opposition by introducing the measure and then voting against it. On other occasions he deliberately proposed amendments to opposition motions in order to make them more extreme and so ensure their defeat. He did this over the debate on the implementation of the treaty of Seville on 23 February 1731 and in the debate on reducing the rate of interest offered to some public creditors on 14 March 1737.<br>
<br>In two famous set-piece encounters Yonge's quick wits confounded the opposition just as they seemed to have the moral high ground. In the debate on the size of the land forces on 30 January 1730 William Shippen, a notorious Jacobite sympathizer, vehemently attacked the standing army and hoped that the ministry's proposal did not imply that the king wished to govern like a German tyrant. This reflection on George II stunned the house for several minutes. Yonge was the first to respond by accusing Shippen of an intolerable slur on his majesty and demanding that he explain himself. Shippen's confusion and the opposition's embarrassment enabled Walpole to move the question at once and to secure a handsome majority. A couple of weeks later, in the great debate on the state of the fortifications of Dunkirk, Samuel Sandys tried to embarrass the ministry by suggesting that the journal of the house should be examined to prove that the tories at the end of Anne's reign had then been vigorous in insisting that the French should destroy the fortifications of Dunkirk. Yonge, whose memory was better, promptly seconded his proposal. Unfortunately for the opposition, the journal showed that it was the tories who had tried to evade inquiries into the state of Dunkirk's fortifications: &#145;This silenced Mr Sands, and made Sir Robert Walpole triumph&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.43).<h2>
<a name="Assessmentandreputation"></a>Assessment and reputation</h2>Yonge's recorded speeches in the Commons reveal a court whig politician whose principles were consistent and whose political ideology was coherent. He was a staunch opponent of Jacobitism, a firm supporter of the Hanoverian succession, and a regular defender of the royal prerogative and the existing balance of the constitution. In matters of religion he was hostile to Catholicism, favoured an established church subordinate to the state, and was ready to concede freedom of conscience to protestant dissenters. In foreign affairs he believed that Britain must try to maintain the balance of power in Europe and should contrive to keep up large armed forces, hire mercenary troops, subsidize European allies, and be ready to wage war in Europe in order to restrict the power of France. To achieve these ends, he was prepared to support the national debt and a substantial standing army, and the taxes necessary to finance both.<br>
<br>Never an idealist, Yonge consistently maintained that public virtue was in limited supply and the rewarding of friends and supporters was the necessary means to secure a parliamentary majority. He once told the Commons:<blockquote>I talk, Sir, of men as they practically are, and not as in theory we may think to make them; for while men are men, I am afraid, we shall find, that ministers will consult their safety, and members will pursue their resentment, even though their country should thereby suffer. (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 13.1086)</blockquote>In his opinion, virtue and vice existed among ministers and their opponents. Those in office deserved a reasonable reward for the burdens they bore and the services they performed.It may be that Yonge's robust defence of Walpole's political methods, his cynical attitude towards virtue and corruption, and the many lucrative government posts which he held all helped to give him the reputation for personal corruption under which he undoubtedly laboured. It is not clear, however, whether this reputation was fully deserved or not. Lord Chesterfield referred to his &#145;most sullied, not to say blasted character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 5.2084), while Horace Walpole claimed that &#145;Sir Robert always said of him, that nothing but Yonge's character could keep down his parts, and nothing but his parts support his character&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.15&#150;16). Lord Hervey admitted that he could not account for Yonge's bad reputation, seeing it as an exception to the common rule that the true merits of a man usually gain their proper reputation with the public:<blockquote>for without having done anything that I know of remarkably profligate&#151;anything out of the common trade of a ductile courtier and a parliamentary tool&#151;his name was proverbially used to express everything pitiful, corrupt, and contemptible. It is true he was a great liar, but rather a mean than a vicious one. He had always been constant to the same party, was good-natured and good-humoured, never offensive in company, no-body's friend, no body's enemy. (Hervey, 1.35&#150;6)</blockquote>Yet, as Hervey acknowledged, even Walpole &#145;caressed him without loving him, and employed him without trusting him&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>As well as being an active politician for forty years, Yonge greatly cherished his reputation as a rhyming wit, though this only served to make him the butt of genuine poets such as Alexander Pope. In 1730 he helped to convert the comedy <span class="italic">The Jovial Crew</span> by Richard Brome, first produced in 1641, into a comic opera in three acts. A considerable number of songs were added, most of them attributed to Yonge. The revised work was first performed at Drury Lane on 8 February 1731, was a considerable success, and was performed as late as 1791. In 1749 Yonge also wrote the rather coarse epilogue to Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Irene</span>. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 28 June 1748, he was awarded an honorary LLD by Cambridge University in 1749. He died following a stroke at his seat at Escott, near Honiton, on 10 August 1755 and was buried on 14 August in the family vault beneath the chancel of Colyton church.<br>
