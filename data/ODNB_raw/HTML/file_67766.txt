<span class="headword">Irving,  James</span>  (1759&#150;1791), <span class="occ">naval surgeon and slave trader</span>, was born at Langholm, Dumfriesshire, on 15 December 1759, the third and only surviving child of John Irving (1731?&#150;1807), blacksmith and innkeeper, and his wife, Isobel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Little (1725?&#150;1791). As a surgeon and captain in the Liverpool slave trade Irving participated in the transportation of approximately 3000 Africans to slavery in the Americas. In July 1783, aged twenty-three, he undertook his first slave-trading voyage out of Liverpool, Europe's leading slave-trading port. By January 1789 he had completed five voyages, two of which were on board the <i>Princess Royal</i>, a ship which could carry 800 slaves.<br>
<br>From May 1786 Irving wrote to his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Tunstall), at 9 College Lane, Liverpool, describing himself as surgeon. Official reference to his status is available in the examinations book of the Company of Surgeons, though there is no evidence to indicate where he was trained. Irving was passed as a surgeon to African ships on 2 April 1789. In this role he was involved in the physical examination of the slaves gathered for sale on the west coast of Africa, to which he made little reference in his letters written in Africa and the West Indies. However, in December 1786 Irving describes how he and the crew of the <i>Jane</i> were awaiting the sale of their &#145;disagreeable cargo&#146; at Barbados. Impatient with &#145;our black cattle&#146; who are &#145;intolerably noisy&#146;, he commented, &#145;I am almost melted in the midst of five or six hundred of them&#146;  (Schwarz, 112&#150;13). The letters reveal a family man of liberal education, able to reconcile his occupation with his Christian beliefs.<br>
<br>In May 1789, at the comparatively young age of twenty-nine, Irving was promoted to his first captaincy of the <i>Anna</i>, a &#145;fine new vessell&#146;  (Schwarz, 140), capable of carrying eighty slaves. On 27 May 1789, twenty-four days after sailing from Liverpool, the <i>Anna</i> was shipwrecked on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Irving and his crew were captured the following day by &#145;Arabs and Moors&#146;  (ibid., 118&#150;21) and sold into slavery. In captivity Irving established a correspondence with British consular officials at Mogador and Tangier. On 24 June 1789 he pleaded with vice-consul John Hutchinson to &#145;rescue us speedily from the most intollerable slavery&#146;  (ibid.); after lengthy negotiations the consular officials secured their release. On 9 August 1790 Irving informed his wife of &#145;the termination of my bondage, which I have weathered with ten thousand difficulties&#146;  (ibid., 141&#150;2).<br>
<br>Irving's journal indicates that enslavement did not prompt any reflection on his occupation. Nor did he recognize any irony in his situation; on the contrary he recorded that &#145;I could have died rather than devote my life to be spent in so abject a state, bereft of all Christian society, a slave to a savage race who despised and hated me for my belief&#146;  (Schwarz, 94&#150;5). Irving's journal and letters offer a rare insight into the mindset of a participant in the Atlantic slave trade as he is one of the few slave-ship captains for whom personal papers survive.<br>
<br>On his arrival in London in November 1790 Irving wrote of his eagerness to see his son, James, who had been born on 4 December 1789 and baptized fourteen days later in the congregation of protestant dissenters at Benns Garden Chapel, Liverpool. By 14 December 1790 he had agreed to command the <i>Ellen</i>, owned by John Dawson. Following the ship's arrival on the Gold Coast of Africa on 5 April 1791, Irving purchased 341 Africans, eighty-eight of whom were transferred to other ships. On 16 September 1791 the <i>Ellen</i>, with 253 slaves, sailed for Trinidad. Forty-six Africans died during this middle passage. Irving died on 24 December 1791, the sixth and final member of the crew of twenty-seven to perish. There is no evidence to indicate how he died.<br>
