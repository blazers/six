<span class="headword">Firmin,  Giles</span>  (1613/14&#150;1697), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Ipswich, Suffolk, the son of Giles Firmin, an apothecary of Sudbury in the same county, and Martha Dogget, who was related to John Winthrop, afterwards governor of Massachusetts. He underwent a spiritual conversion &#145;when he was a School-Boy&#146; as a result of the preaching of the renowned puritan John Rogers of Dedham, Essex  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.297&#150;8). He matriculated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 24 September 1629, where his tutor was Thomas Hill, afterwards master of Trinity College, Cambridge. However, he did not graduate, turning instead to the study of medicine. On 8 April 1632, aged eighteen, he sailed from Southampton with his father to New England, landing at Boston on 26 May. There he practised medicine. He returned to England in 1633, but arrived back in New England in June 1637. In 1638 he was ordained a deacon of the First Church, Boston, of which John Cotton was minister, and he was present at the excommunication of the antinomian Anne Hutchinson. In January 1639 he moved to Ipswich, Massachusetts, where he was granted 100 acres of land, and that year he married Susanna, the daughter of Nathaniel Ward, then pastor of the church at Ipswich and afterwards rector of Shenfield, Essex. He returned to England in the autumn of 1644, surviving shipwreck on the coast of Spain, when, Calamy reports  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.295), his four-year-old daughter, who had remained with her mother in New England, was distressed by an intimation of his danger of drowning. He was preaching at Colchester in 1645. In 1648 he received presbyterian ordination from Daniel Rogers, Stephen Marshall, and others, and became vicar of Shalford, Essex.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1654, prompted by the publication of Richard Baxter's <span class="italic">Apology</span>, in which Baxter expressed  (pt 1, p. 106) his high regard for the &#145;Candour, Ingenuitie, Moderation, Love &amp; Peace&#146; of Firmin's <span class="italic">Separation Examined</span> (1651), he wrote to Baxter, to whose &#145;learned &amp; godly workes&#146; he professed himself no stranger  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 192). He lamented that in Essex &#145;wee are the deadest County in all the Nation, Gospel-glutted professors&#146; and regretted the lack of church discipline evident in the promiscuous giving of the Lord's supper and the willingness of ministers to baptize the children of parents whose profession of faith was contradicted by their ungodly lives, a practice which he argued against in <span class="italic">A Serious Question Stated</span> (1651). Although in his <span class="italic">Gangraena</span> (1646) the presbyterian Thomas Edwards had printed letters of August 1645 which claimed that &#145;Mr. <i>F</i>. an Apothecary Physitian of <i>New England</i>&#146;  (Edwards, 1.101) was an Independent opponent of presbyterian domination, Firmin was no friend to congregationalism. Committed to the ideal of a parochial national church, he was dismayed by the spread of what he regarded as separatist principles. In <span class="italic">Of Schism, Parochial Congregations in England, and Ordination by Imposition of Hands</span> (1658) he defined (and reproved) schism as &#145;causeless separation from a particular Church&#146;  (p. 3), in contradiction of the view of John Owen, the leading congregationalist, in his <span class="italic">A Review of the True Nature of Schisme</span> (1657), that it consisted rather in division between the members of a particular church. In the 1650s Firmin actively promoted a voluntary association of ministers in Essex along the lines of the Worcestershire association established by Richard Baxter. <span class="italic">The Agreement of the Associated Ministers of &hellip; Essex</span> was published in 1658.<br>
<br>In 1660, apprehensive about the possibility of an episcopalian ecclesiastical settlement following the Restoration, Firmin wrote to Baxter that &#145;so they will not force me to owne their power as being of Divine Authoritie, I will not oppose them&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 660). However, while he could accept modified episcopacy, Firmin could not accept prelatical exclusivity. He argued for the validity of presbyterian orders in <span class="italic">Presbyterial Ordination Vindicated</span> (1660) and, many years later in his anonymous <span class="italic">The Questions between the Conformist and Nonconformist</span> (1681), distinguished between the <i>episcopus praeses</i> (presiding bishop) who served in the apostolic church &#145;when Elders in a particular Church were multiplied&#146;, and the unacceptable <i>episcopus princeps</i> (pre-eminent, imperial or lordly bishop) which &#145;is <i>our</i> Case&#146;, with &#145;Superiority of power above <i>Presbyters</i>&#146;  (pp. 103&#150;4). In <span class="italic">The Liturgical Considerator Considered</span> (1661), a reply to John Gauden's <span class="italic">Considerations Touching the Liturgy</span> (1661), Firmin argued against the imposition of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. When the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662 required of ministers both episcopal ordination and subscription to the prayer book, Firmin left the established church, retiring to Ridgewell, Essex, where he again practised medicine.<br>
<br>Although he regularly held conventicles and was &#145;a Constant and Laborious Preacher; both on the Lord's Days, and on Week Days too&#146;, though not at the time of the monthly sermon in the parish church, which he attended as an auditor  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.296), Firmin was not molested by the authorities, for he enjoyed &#145;the Favour and Respect&#146; of &#145;the Neighbouring Gentry and Justices of Peace &hellip; on the Account of their using him as Physician&#146;  (ibid.). Following the publication of Charles II's declaration of indulgence in 1672 he was licensed in April as a presbyterian teacher at the house of Thomas Bryon in Ridgewell, and in December in his own home there. In July the home of Daniel Ray, the ejected vicar of Ridgewell, was also licensed as a presbyterian meeting-place. Calamy says that in 1672 he and Firmin &#145;set up a Meeting&#146; at Ridgewell &#145;together&#146;  (ibid., 2.304), but the following year Ray moved to Burstall, Suffolk, and Firmin remained in charge of the single presbyterian congregation at Ridgewell until his death.<br>
<br>Firmin &#145;was eminent for the Oriental tongues, well read in the Fathers, Schoolmen and Church History, and the Controversies with <i>Papists, Socinians, Arminians</i>&#146; but, in Calamy's view, &#145;he did most excel in Practical Divinity&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.297), as evidenced by his <span class="italic">The Real Christian</span> (1670). This treatise on conversion, sincerity, and assurance took issue with the introspective thrust of the main puritan tradition and with the formulation of stages of conversion and marks of assurance by such practical English and New England divines as William Perkins, Thomas Hooker, Thomas Shepard, Daniel Rogers, and John Rogers. Firmin argued that faith is compatible with imperfection and uncertainty, and reproved their over-insistence on the scrupulous performance of duties, making (he claimed) those &#145;no Christians&#146; who failed to meet their standards  (Firmin, <span class="italic">The Real Christian</span>, 311). Among his targets in <span class="italic">The Real Christian</span> was Baxter's advice on meditation in <span class="italic">The Saints Everlasting Rest</span> (1650) which Firmin held to be &#145;too strict&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.102, para. 224). Baxter, who would have preferred to conduct the controversy by private letter, replied in <span class="italic">The Duty of Heavenly Meditation</span> (1671), to which Firmin responded in <span class="italic">Meditations upon Mr. Baxter's Review of his Treatise</span> (1672), still maintaining that Baxter made &#145;Gospel-Conversion, and Gospel-Conversation&#146; &#145;more <i>difficult</i> than God hath made them&#146;  (Firmin, <span class="italic">Meditations</span>, 2). In a letter occasioned by this exchange Baxter describes Firmin as &#145;a man more sound in judgment than most Divines of the age you live in&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, letter 852).<br>
<br>In 1693 Firmin was drawn into the controversies which led to the breakup of the &#145;Happy Union&#146; between presbyterians and congregationalists, writing against the congregational Richard Davis's <span class="italic">Truth and Innocency Vindicated</span> [1692] in his <span class="italic">Brief Review of Mr. Davis's Vindication</span> (1693). Firmin died (presumably at Ridgewell) in April 1697; no will is known. Both his sons attended Cambridge University and conformed, Nathaniel (<i>b</i>. 1648/9) becoming a physician and Giles (<i>b</i>. 1650/51) an ordained minister in the established church.<br>
