<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Edward Leader</span>  (1828&#150;1910), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Worcester on 28 April 1828, the eldest of the eleven children of Edward Leader Williams (1802&#150;1879), also a civil engineer and later chief engineer to the Severn navigation commissioners. Benjamin Williams Leader RA (1831&#150;1923) was a younger son. Williams was educated privately and at the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, and after being apprenticed at sixteen to his father worked until 1846 on the Severn between Stourport and Gloucester, 43 miles of which he helped to make navigable during dry weather. During the next three years he was engaged as assistant engineer under Joseph Cubitt in Lincolnshire on the Great Northern Railway. He was resident engineer from 1849 to 1852 at Shoreham harbour, which he extended towards Hove. From 1852 to 1855 he served as engineer to the contractors for the Admiralty pier at Dover. On 30 August 1852 he married Ellen Maria (1827&#150;1860), daughter of Thomas Popplewell, a merchant captain from Lincolnshire. Following her death, on 22 April 1862 he married Catherine Louisa (<i>b</i>. 1843), daughter of Richard Joseph Clinch, an agent, of Northwich.<br>
<br>In 1856 Williams became engineer to the River Weaver Trust and thereafter confined himself to works for inland navigation. He improved the River Weaver out of all recognition, making the channel deeper and wider, enlarging the locks and introducing steam traction, thus attracting most of the salt traffic from Cheshire to Liverpool together with the return freight of coal. In order to establish through traffic with the Trent and Mersey Canal, which the Weaver crosses at Anderton, Williams designed, with Edwin Clark, a hydraulic lift for raising or lowering canal boats from one to the other. The lift comprised two caissons, each capable of holding two 50 ton barges side by side. From 1876 it supplied an effective substitute for a flight of five to six locks, by raising craft vertically through 51 feet from canal to river. In 1872, before the lift was completed, Williams became engineer to the Bridgewater Navigation Company. Here he enlarged the locks at Runcorn, deepened the canal from 4 ft 6 in. to 6 ft, and introduced steam propulsion, which he facilitated by building an almost vertical wall on one side of the canal for about 30 miles. Thus he trebled the maximum permissible tonnage of barges and halved the cost of haulage.<br>
<br>In 1882 Williams became, jointly with Hamilton Henry Fulton, engineer to the provisional committee which was considering the formation of a ship canal to Manchester. Fulton had previously put forward a project for a tidal canal. Each engineer submitted a proposal. Fulton's sea-level canal would have reached Manchester at a depth of 60 ft below street level and would have required a link by underground railway between the docks and the city centre. On the emphatic recommendation of James Abernethy of Liverpool the committee adopted Williams's proposal to use the tidal channel of the Mersey as far as practicable, and then to cut a canal with four huge locks for raising ships gradually to the level of Manchester. He was thereupon appointed chief engineer and the canal became thenceforward &#145;the work of his life&#146;. Parliament refused the necessary powers in 1883 and 1884, but granted them in 1885. The three years' contest occupied 175 days, and cost the applicants &pound;150,000, their opponents &pound;100,000. The failure of the first two applications was due largely to the opposition of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, who feared that the proposed training and deepening of the tidal channel from Runcorn through the Mersey would affect the navigation of the estuary. Williams then modified his proposals in regard to the lower portion of the projected waterway. In 1887 a contract for the construction of the canal was entered into with T. A. Walker, at a cost of &pound;5.75 million, and the first sod was cut at Eastham by Lord Egerton of Tatton on 11 November 1887, using an ordinary spade and barrow, which was loaded, wheeled, and tipped by Williams. In 1889, however, Walker died, and the work was ultimately let in sections to several contractors.<br>
<br>The difficulties emerging during the course of construction proved much greater than had been anticipated. They arose from the canal's location on the world's busiest highway of commerce, from the consequent opposition by rail, shipping, and mercantile interests, and from statutory obligations imposed on the company for the protection of public as well as private interests. Williams found that his task required &#145;the engineering of men as well as of matter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 3 Jan 1910, 4vi). Fortunately his commanding presence, abounding energy, fertility of resource, and genial manner secured him respect as well as co-operation. During the process of construction the dimensions of the waterway were changed. The bottom width was increased by one-fifth to 120 ft and the bottom depth by one-third to 26 ft, the same depth as the Suez Canal. The material excavated amounted to 54 million cubic yards, half as much as had been removed during the construction of the Suez Canal. It was excavated at a very high speed, averaging some 750,000 cubic yards every month, mostly by means of eighty steam navvies and land dredgers; the use of such labour-saving machines almost precipitated a strike in 1890.<br>
<br>The line of the canal crossed the Mersey and Irwell fifteen times. Provision had to be made for subterranean syphons and culverts and for some fifteen transverse crossings of the two rivers, which were effected by means of six fixed high-level viaducts and bridges, eight swing bridges, and one swing aqueduct. At Barton, James Brindley's aqueduct of 1760&#150;61 carried the Bridgewater Canal, whose waters were still pure enough for fish to breed, across the River Irwell, and the task of replacing that aqueduct presented Williams with his greatest challenge. In 1883 Williams had hoped to duplicate the Anderton lift at Barton by building a fixed high-level aqueduct over the ship canal, but he abandoned that impracticable scheme and devised instead a swinging aqueduct, which proved to be his true masterpiece. The four ends of the canal and aqueduct could be sealed before the swing by means of a watertight breaking joint; the swinging span weighed 1600 tons, including 800 tons of water, and could be turned like a swing bridge in two minutes, leaving clear two 90 foot wide spans of the ship canal. The canal was 35&frac12; miles in length from the entrance locks at Eastham to the Manchester docks. Four more sets of locks raised vessels some 60 feet above sea-level, and there were 110 sluices which used the self-balancing roller gate patented in 1874 by Francis G. M. Stoney and adopted on the Aswan Dam.<br>
<br>Williams survived successive crises in the administration of the company, especially in 1891&#150;2 and 1893. Thereafter the company was reconstituted as a dyarchy under the aegis of the Manchester corporation. The estimated cost of &pound;5.6 million made in 1883 was trebled to &pound;15.2 million. That sum included nearly &pound;3 million for the purchase of the Bridgewater Navigation Company as well as interest paid on capital during the period of construction. The lower portion of the canal was first used by traffic on 16 July 1891: eighteen directors made an inaugural voyage on board the <i>Snowdrop</i> on 7 December 1893 and gave three hearty cheers for Williams as their vessel reached Barton. The canal was opened informally on 1 January 1894 and formally on 21 May 1894 by Queen Victoria, who was on her way to Balmoral. After the opening the financial condition of the Ship Canal Company remained parlous and would have been even worse without the Bridgewater Canal, whose gross receipts surpassed those of the ship canal during its first six years. The company paid no dividend to its ordinary shareholders until 1915. &#145;The engineers have brought the ship canal to its present pitiable [financial] condition&#146;; &#145;The Manchester Ship Canal has proved the grave of some good reputations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Engineering</span>, 8 June 1894, 751; 15 June 1894, 787).<br>
<br>Williams emerged, however, with an enhanced reputation, as the engineer of the greatest work of the century and as a worthy successor to Brindley. He was knighted on 2 July 1894 and elected in 1895 president of the Manchester Association of Engineers as well as a member of the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers, of which he had been a member since 1860. In 1883 he had become a member of both the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Iron and Steel Institute. Self-reliant, homely, and simple in his tastes, Williams was always loath to speak of his own achievements. He became consulting engineer to the Ship Canal Company in 1905 and practised privately until shortly before his death. His hobby was photography, which he took up in its early stages. He became a burgess of the Altrincham Court Leet. His family was distinguished for its longevity: he himself died at the age of eighty-one on 1 January 1910, at his home, The Oaks, Bowdon, Cheshire. His wife survived him. Appropriately the funeral service at Bowdon parish church, where he was buried, on 4 January 1910 was conducted by the Revd Hewlett Johnson, who had qualified as an engineer before he became vicar of Altrincham in 1906.<br>
<br>The ship canal permanently reduced the costs of transport on the route to Liverpool and ushered in a new era of prosperity for Manchester. Ships could complete the transit in seven and a half hours rather than in the ten originally envisaged, and could undertake night passages with the aid of a searchlight. Above all, they could use the canal when Liverpool docks closed between high tides. The Suez Canal was deepened in 1895 to 28 feet but the new port of Manchester developed its transatlantic traffic rather than its Eastern trade. Together Liverpool and Manchester increased their joint share of the nation's trade for twenty-five years after 1894, reducing in proportion the relative importance of the Severn navigation.<br>
