<span class="headword">Balme,  David Mowbray</span>  (1912&#150;1989), <span class="occ">university administrator and classical scholar</span>, was born on 8 September 1912 at Carlisle, eldest of the four children of Harold Balme (1878&#150;1953), a surgeon, and his wife, Hilda Carr (<i>d</i>. 1968). He spent his first ten years in China, while his father was professor of surgery at Cheeloo (Qilu) University. He was educated at Marlborough College and at Clare College, Cambridge (1931&#150;4), where he gained first class honours in both parts of the classical tripos. He then embarked on research into ancient Greek philosophy and science, spending 1934&#150;6 with Julius Stenzel at the University of Halle. This led in 1939 and 1940 to two trail-blazing articles on Greek science, and to a lifelong concern with the scientific works of Aristotle. On 29 December 1936 he married Beatrice Margaret Rice, and they had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After two terms as a lecturer at Reading University, Balme returned to Cambridge in 1937, first winning a research fellowship at Clare, and then (1940) as a fellow of Jesus College. However, his academic progress was almost immediately interrupted by his call-up into the Royal Air Force. He qualified so well as a pilot that his initial employment was as a flying instructor. But he wanted a more active part in the war and was eventually allowed to convert to fly four-engined Lancaster bombers. With the newly commissioned Balme's arrival in 207 squadron at the end of March 1943 there began a remarkably illustrious wartime RAF career. By August, outstanding courage and determination had brought him an immediate DFC, exceptional promotion to squadron leader, and appointment as flight commander. Four months later, having completed thirty-one operations, many of them outstandingly successful, he was made DSO. Balme then served for a time in the Air Ministry, but by the end of the war he was again on active service as a wing commander commanding Lancaster squadrons.<br>
<br>By the end of 1945 Balme was back in Cambridge as tutor, soon senior tutor, at Jesus College. This experience combined with his scholarship and wartime leadership to make him an ideal candidate for recruitment to lead one of the university colleges then being set up to help in the post-war development of Britain's tropical colonies. Balme initially resisted this, but in 1948 he accepted a five-year contract to be the founding principal of the university college in the Gold Coast. There he set out to build a university institution of the very highest standard. To Balme this meant something which would in due course stand comparison with the University of Cambridge. He quickly sought to move away from the professor-dominated system of government originally provided for his college to a collegiate form in which all dons would have a voice, and he gave priority in the building programme to the construction of pleasant residences which were home to dons as well as students. He resisted any charge, whether from layman or academic, Ghanaian or Briton, that his institution was inappropriate for Africa, or that it was too expensive, and continued to pursue his goal with the same single-minded determination with which he had once conducted bombing raids into Germany and Italy. But as the colonial Gold Coast began to turn into the independent state of Ghana, so there was increased competition for development funds, and so less opportunity for Balme to mould his university as he thought best. After his first five years Balme was made a CMG in 1955, but he found a second five-year contract appreciably less attractive. Already a committed Christian, he was now received into the Roman Catholic church. He was disappointed by the refusal of his colleagues to accept his bold view that his college should become a full university, free from the guiding reins of London University with which it had set out, before it became open to the political whims of an independent Ghanaian state, so when in October 1957 a senior classics post became available at Queen Mary College, University of London, he decided the time had come to return to the teaching and research which had become increasingly squeezed out of his life.<br>
<br>In 1964 Balme was elected professor of classics at Queen Mary College, and he continued in this post until his retirement in 1978, building up a reputation as a formidable and much loved teacher, and producing publications relating to Aristotle's scientific works that won international renown. In addition to pioneering articles, these included annotated translations of <span class="italic">De partibus animalium I</span> and <span class="italic">De generatione animalium I</span> (1972), and the posthumous edition of and commentary on the <span class="italic">Historia animalium</span> (1991). In 1966 he made his home at Gumley in the Leicestershire countryside, where fox-hunting became a major enjoyment alongside his lifelong pursuit of music. There, on 23 February 1989, he died of a brain tumour; he was buried on 2 March in the local churchyard. He was survived by his wife.<br>
