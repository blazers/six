<span class="headword">O'Meara <span class="st"> [Meara]</span>,  Dermot <span class="st"> [Dermod]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1614&#150;1642), <span class="occ">physician and author</span>, was, according to the title-page of his 1615 work <span class="italic">Ormonius</span>, born in Ormond, co. Tipperary. He was a member of the family of the O'Mearas who were closely connected with the earls of Ormond and may have been the son of Domhnail of Lisaniskey, the most prominent O'Meara of the time, and the brother of William O'Meara, sheriff of the county palatine of Ormond in 1616. About 1614 O'Meara's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18486/', "Edmund O'Meara")</script>, was born in Ormond.<br>
<br>O'Meara studied at Oxford University, although Wood could later find no record of his matriculation, and styled himself &#145;insignissimae Oxoniensis Academiae quondam alumnus&#146; (&#145;erstwhile student of the outstanding academy of Oxford&#146;) in his 1615 panegyric on Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond. The work, published in London, was entitled <span class="italic">Ormonius, sive, Illustrissimi herois ac domini D. Thomae Butleri, Ormoniae et Ossoriae comitis commemoratio</span>, and has been described as &#145;perhaps the most complete account of Thomas's life in existence&#146;  (Carney, 173). With it were printed two other pieces: <span class="italic">Anagramaticon, acrosticon, &amp; chronologicon in eundem Thomae Butler</span> and <span class="italic">Epicedion in obitum Thomae Butler Ormoniae &amp; Ossoriae comitis</span>.<br>
<br>Walter Harris notes that O'Meara became a physician of &#145;great repute&#146; in Ireland; he was physician to both the tenth and eleventh earls of Ormond. In 1619 he published <span class="italic">Pathologia haereditaria generalis</span>. In the dedication, to Sir Oliver St John, lord deputy of Ireland, he wrote on the need for the regulation of medical practice in Ireland:<blockquote>There are certainly more persons in Dublin at the present day practising the Art of Medicine than any other art, yet there are very few of them who have the six qualifications which Hippocrates requires in a Medical Doctor. Here, not only cursed Mountebanks &hellip; but also persons of every other craft whatsoever &hellip; all have free leave to profane the holy temple of Asculapius. (translation in Fleetwood, 23&#150;4)</blockquote>The book was reprinted in a work by Edmund O'Meara in London in 1665 (<span class="italic">Examen diatribae Thomae Willisy</span>), and again in Amsterdam the following year.<br>
<br>About 1620 O'Meara may have been a teacher in Carrick-on-Suir, co. Tipperary, owing to the imprisonment of his patron Walter Butler, eleventh earl of Ormond. An affidavit of one Captain Edmund Corcoran, dated 26 April 1653 (now in the National Library in Prague), states, &#145;Col. Walter Butler of Roscrea was able to speak Latin fluently because in his youth he had studied Logic and Humanities under Doctor Dermot Meara in Carrick&#146;  (Logan, 313). No more is known about him for the next two decades.<br>
<br>O'Meara was a Catholic and a supporter of the Irish party of the confederation of Kilkenny. On 12 October 1642 a letter from the lords justices of Ireland to the principal secretary of state in London stated &#145;We hear that Dr. Dermot O'Meara the elder a doctor in physick is now or was lately at the court. He stands indicted here of high treason which we hold fit to make known to his majesty&#146;  (Logan, 313). The letter is signed by James Butler, twelfth earl of Ormond, among others, and so it seems O'Meara had lost his position with that family. The last that is known of him is this report by Walter Enos of a letter that O'Meara sent to a friend in Dublin, in which he refers to James Butler, twelfth earl of Ormond: &#145;his will is that the dismembered parliament there [in Dublin] continue, and [he] prayed the king to turn the Irish over unto him and he would draw them to what condition he pleased&#146;  (ibid.). No record of Dermot O'Meara's death, nor of any will, has been found.<br>
