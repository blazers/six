<span class="headword">Lewyn,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1364&#150;1398), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, is first recorded in 1364 working at Coldingham Priory, a Scottish dependency of Durham Cathedral priory. At Durham itself he had charge of building the kitchen serving the monks' refectory in 1367&#150;74, during which period he was paid &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a year and a robe worth 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. The kitchen is unique among Gothic structures of centralized plan in being covered by a masonry vault incorporating four pairs of intersecting parallel ribs. The small central octagon generated by these ribs carries the walls of the lantern and smoke louver. The inspiration behind this design is not obvious, although it is probably significant that a much less impressive square version of the same scheme was built over the kitchen of Raby Castle, co. Durham, also begun in 1367. An awareness of the timber vault over the octagonal crossing of Ely Cathedral (1334&#150;41) is very likely, although the latter's solid geometry differs importantly from that at Durham. Whether Lewyn was acquainted with the much earlier Spanish Islamic and Romanesque vaults which provide the closest analogies for his vault cannot be known.<br>
<br>By 1368 Lewyn was described as &#145;the bishop's mason&#146; and was granted lands by Bishop Thomas Hatfield (<i>d</i>. 1381); other grants by Hatfield were to follow in the 1370s. Also in 1368 Lewyn was appointed to repair the king's castle at Bamburgh. Some work had been done there by 1372, but in 1375 inquiry was made into allegations that Lewyn had received money for the work but had failed to carry out the repairs. In 1378, the same year as saw the reorganization of the king's works in southern England, Lewyn was appointed to carry out works at the royal castle of Carlisle and at Roxburgh Castle, the latter taken from the Scots in 1346. Lewyn's work at Carlisle, the still-extant main gatehouse, does not conform to the terms of the indenture for its building drawn up on 4 April 1378, perhaps because of the need to keep in continuous use the pre-existing and adjacent sheriff's office and prison.<br>
<br>By 1378 Lewyn may well have been regarded as the leading military architect in the north, for in that year he also contracted with Richard, Lord Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1403), for the first phase of Bolton Castle, Yorkshire. Work was completed <i>c</i>.1397, probably largely in accordance with the original scheme. Although unique in the intricacy of its internal planning, Bolton's quadrangular layout with bulky rectangular corner towers inspired imitations at Sheriff Hutton in the North Riding of Yorkshire (1382), Lumley in co. Durham, and Wressle in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The first two castles have several times been attributed to Lewyn. In their overall form, and in various points of detail, all the northern quadrangular castles are indebted to the greatest English castle-building project of the fourteenth century, Edward III's reconstruction of the upper ward at Windsor (1357&#150;69).<br>
<br>In 1380 Lewyn contracted with John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1399), to build a new &#145;mantelet&#146; against the inner face of the fourteenth-century gatehouse at Dunstanburgh Castle. Bishop John Fordham (<i>d</i>. 1425) in 1384 appointed Lewyn a commissioner of array for the city of Durham, and with several partners he was granted the borough of Durham to farm; he was also engaged in the export of wool overseas. In 1385&#150;6 he was superintending building works for the crown at Berwick upon Tweed. For Ralph, sixth Lord Neville of Raby (<i>d</i>. 1425), Lewyn and his son Walter undertook in 1392 to renew all defective roads at Brancepeth, possibly the result of heavy wear during building operations at the castle there. Between 1390 and 1398 Lewyn was carrying out work at Finchale Priory, a dependency of Durham Priory. It has been plausibly suggested that around this time he was designing the unique cruciform donjon at Warkworth Castle for the earl of Northumberland. Even discounting this and the other major castles which have been attributed to him, Lewyn is clearly recognizable as the leading late fourteenth-century architect in the northernmost counties of England.<br>
