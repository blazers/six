<span class="headword">Sparke,  Thomas</span>  (1548&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is said by Wood to have originated at South Somercotes, Lincolnshire. Elected to a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1567, he was a fellow there from 1569 to 1572. He graduated BA in October, proceeding MA in January 1574, BTh on 8 July 1575, and DTh on 1 July 1581. Rector of South Somercotes as early as 1571, on 26 January 1576 he was collated archdeacon of Stow by Thomas Cooper, bishop of Lincoln, whose chaplain he had become. In 1578 he was presented to the rectory of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, by Arthur, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, where he is said to have been &#145;held in great esteem for his piety&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.189). But on 6 March 1582, conscience-stricken that this living was far removed from the duties of his archdeaconry (apparently the pangs were not about pluralism as such), he resigned the latter office, having already found compensation in presentment to the Lincoln prebend of Sutton in Marisco.<br>
<br>Although he was a beneficed clergyman, Sparke's sympathies lay with the puritan wing of the Church of England. In December 1584, along with Walter Travers, he represented the interests of the godly in a meeting with Archbishop Whitgift and Bishop Cooper at Lambeth Palace, primarily about subscription to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. The conference was held at the insistence of the earl of Leicester, who was joined by Walsingham, Burghley, and Sparke's patron Grey for two days of deliberations. Though keenly anticipated by the puritans, not least because it tacitly set their ministry on a par with that of the bishops, the meeting was disappointing in its effects. Sparke and Travers confined themselves to matters concerning lectionary readings from the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, and to certain perceived abuses in the baptismal rite, and refused to engage in debate with Whitgift over matters of polity and the Christian ministry, let alone the large puritan objections to the prayer book <i>in toto</i>. Ultimately the meeting achieved only a further easing of subscription to the prayer book, already limited since the summer, and that seems to have been effected by Walsingham and to have owed little or nothing to the debate.<br>
<br>Sparke's second appearance as a puritan champion proved even more disappointing for the precisians than that of 1584. On 1 November 1603 he was one of the representatives of the godly cause to appear before James I at the Hampton Court conference. Though still noted as &#145;a great nonconformist and a pillar of puritanism&#146;, who refused to attend in clerical garb but wore &#145;such that Turkey merchants wear&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.190), he none the less remained silent during the whole of the first day's proceedings. Next day, following a private audience with James (for whose right of succession he had earlier been an advocate), Sparke completely abandoned his nonconformity. His conversion led to the publication in 1607 of <span class="italic">A Brotherly Perswasion to Unity and Uniformity in Judgement and Practice</span>. Sparke dedicated it to James I, giving the king credit for his being persuaded &#145;by your majesties owne most readie and apt answers&#146; and addressing him as &#145;over all persons, and in all causes Ecclesiasticall as civil in these his dominions&#146;  (Sparke, <span class="italic">Perswasion</span>, sig. A3<i>r</i>). Not only is the royal supremacy proclaimed, but Sparke also recants even those marginal scruples he had maintained in 1584, and goes on to allow <i>jure divino</i> status for bishops, for &#145;in respect of their ministry and spiritual iurisdiction in the Church, they wel may be said to be of God's own ordinance&#146;  (ibid., 78). Sparke's treatise was answered by Samuel Hieron in the following year.<br>
<br>Sparke also published funeral sermons preached for the second earl of Bedford in 1585 and for his patron Lord Grey in 1593, and a rebuttal of Jean d'Albin de Valsergue's <span class="italic">Discourse Against Heresies</span>, entitled <span class="italic">An Answere to Master John De Albines, Notable Discourse</span> (1591). As was customary, Sparke reproduces the entire text of d'Albin's work in his own, replying to it section by section. Dedicated to Lord Grey, the book is more a defence of protestantism in general than of the Church of England in particular.<br>
<br>Sparke is recorded by Wood as having been so respected at Oxford for his learning and exemplary manner of living &#145;that the sages of the university thought it fit, after his death, to have his picture painted on the wall in the school-gallery among the English divines of note&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.190). He died at Bletchley on 8 October 1616 and was buried in the chancel of the parish church, where he is commemorated by a monument. With his wife, Rose Inkforbye (<i>d</i>. 1615), the youngest daughter of an Ipswich merchant, he had ten children, of whom five survived their parents. Three of Sparke's sons followed him into the ministry of the church, including <a name="cosubject_26085"></a><span class="headword">William Sparke</span>  (1587&#150;1641)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Bletchley and followed his father to Magdalen in 1603, becoming first a demy and then a fellow, both in 1606. Graduating in 1607, he proceeded MA in 1609 and BTh in 1629. He resigned his fellowship in 1616 to succeed his father as rector of Bletchley. He also became a chaplain to the duke of Buckingham. He published two treatises, <span class="italic">Vis naturae et virtus vitae explicatae</span> (1612) and <span class="italic">The Mystery of Godlinesse</span> (1628). He is recorded as living at Bletchley in 1630, but indebtedness forced him to resign the living; on 20 May 1641, however, he became rector of Chenies, also in Buckinghamshire. He died in October that year. He is not known to have married.<br>
