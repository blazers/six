<span class="headword">Martin,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1869), <span class="occ">meteorologist</span>, practised for some time as a physician in London. He is better known as editor of <span class="italic">An account of the natives of the Tonga Islands, in the south Pacific Ocean, with an original grammar and vocabulary of their language. Compiled and arranged from the extensive communications of Mr William Mariner, several years resident in those islands</span> (2 vols., 1817), reprinted in 1827 as volumes 13 and 14 of <span class="italic">Constable's Miscellany</span>. A French translation appeared in Paris in 1817; a German translation was published in Weimar in 1819 and an American edition at Boston in 1820.<br>
<br>William Mariner had been held in friendly captivity on the islands from 1806 until 1810. His experiences were generally corroborated by a sailor named Jeremiah Higgins, who had accompanied Mariner but who was able to leave there thirteen months before Mariner's departure.<br>
<br>Little is known of Martin's subsequent career. Letters he wrote to his publisher, John Murray, during the period 1815&#150;26, preserved in the firm's archives, deal mainly with the preparation and publication of Mariner's <span class="italic">Tonga Islands</span>. By April 1823 Martin was in financial straits and declared to Murray his intention of giving a course of lectures in London on &#145;The inductive method of philosophy&#146;. It is doubtful whether any lectures were given, as, in the following month, he signed the register as a witness to a marriage in Lisbon. In his letter of 20 April he wrote that friends had suggested he should sell <span class="italic">Tonga Islands</span> to Constable for their <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> and he asked Murray for his opinion. Murray must have agreed for, as already noted, this course was followed. Martin's stay in Lisbon was not a long one. In November 1825 he was committed to the Fleet prison for debt where he remained for six months. Shortly before his release he wrote to Murray thanking him for his recommendation to the Literary Fund Society for some financial help, and also for an unsolicited gift of &pound;5. He returned to Portugal and in November 1844 he signed the minutes of a meeting of the Association of Factors, a body of British merchants.<br>
<br>Martin's meteorological investigations were sent, in later life, to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, which noted:<blockquote>In our own pages we have had occasion to record his labours during the last twenty years in the observation of atmospherical phenomena, especially with reference to pressure, temperature, and moisture. Martin laid down meteorological charts representing the varying aspects of months, seasons, and years from daily observation. He also made careful observation with reference to ozone, as well as on the characteristics and circumstances affecting cholera and yellow fever. These labours are the more commendable as the work of an old man, executed in different colours with scrupulous neatness, and mostly at night after the fatigue of practice. (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 7 Aug 1869)</blockquote>In the census of May 1861 Martin was listed among the British residents in Lisbon, where he died on 8 July 1869.<br>
