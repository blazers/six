<span class="headword">Thompson,  Francis</span>  (1808&#150;1895), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 25 July 1808 at Woodbridge, Suffolk, the second of the seven children of George Thompson (1777&#150;1862), builder and county surveyor of Suffolk, and his wife, Elizabeth (1786&#150;1856), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miles. The Thompsons had been farmers in nearby Bredfield during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, though Francis's grandfather Jacob Thompson (1744&#150;1834), a Quaker, was a builder and his uncle Mark Grayston Thompson (<i>c</i>.1785&#150;1852) and his first cousin William Pattison (1805&#150;1878) were local architects.<br>
<br>Thompson was educated at Woodbridge grammar school, and absorbed an early interest in architecture from seeing his uncle's and father's work. A miniature at the age of twenty-one shows him with reddish hair. A full-length photograph of 1859 by William Notman of Montreal shows him of medium height and lean build, with full wavy hair and goatee beard. A photograph of 1871 by J. W. Thomas of Hastings shows receding hair and a groomed beard and moustache.<br>
<br>Thompson was married three times. His first marriage was to Anna Maria Watson (<i>c</i>.1810&#150;1832) at Woodbridge church on 17 May 1830. Ambition and a spirit for adventure took the pair to Montreal in Canada. Their son Francis Jacob was born in 1831. Anna died the following year during the cholera epidemic which claimed 4000 lives in Montreal. With a flair for hard work and a natural ability in design, Thompson received commissions from new settlers and established merchants for houses, commercial buildings, court facilities, a church, and&#151;in partnership with John Wells (1789&#150;1864)&#151;the imposing St Ann's market hall. The building became the Canadian parliament house (1844&#150;9).<br>
<br>Growing civil unrest between the French majority and the increasing number of British settlers prompted Thompson to return to Britain in 1837. The timing was fortuitous. Railway companies, still in their infancy, were eager to employ architects and engineers to meet new and exciting challenges in design and construction. It was into this field of work that Thompson moved. In February 1839 the North Midland Railway, about to construct a 72 mile line from Derby to Leeds, appointed him their architect. Their engineer was Robert Stephenson (1803&#150;1859), and an acclaimed working relationship was established between the pair.<br>
<br>At Derby, Francis designed the world's first comprehensive railway settlement, with a magnificent station and three-bay glazed train-shed, locomotive roundhouse and workshop, workers' houses, and a hotel. Late Georgian in character, the hotel, roundhouse, and houses form part of the Derby Station conservation area. The station was enlarged several times and redevelopment, rather than restoration, was carried out during the 1980s.<br>
<br>Robert Stephenson and Francis Thompson next acted for the Chester and Holyhead Railway (1845&#150;50), and at the Menai Strait produced one of the finest examples of engineering architecture to be found in the nineteenth century. The Britannia Bridge was damaged by fire in 1970, but the elegant masonry escaped damage and now supports steel arches in lieu of wrought-iron tubes. The elegant Italianate station which Thompson built at Chester resembled the one at Derby in layout, but has bay platforms at either end.<br>
<br>Around 1840 Thompson married again, and following the death of his second wife, Elizabeth (1815&#150;1852), he married Mary Ann Groves (1818&#150;1896) of Wareham, Dorset, on 30 June 1853. Retracing steps taken twenty-three years earlier, he sailed with his new wife for Canada. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada and the Atlantic and St Lawrence railroad, with a 900 mile route planned to link Portland, Maine, with Montreal, Toronto, and Detroit, appointed Francis their architect from 1853 to 1859. He designed the masonry for the Victoria Bridge in Montreal, the terminus at Portland, Maine (claimed to be the largest station in America when opened in 1855), elegant stone and slate standard-plan stations, and workshops.<br>
<br>In April 1859 Thompson returned to London and in 1866 he designed a house at Hastings for retirement. Memories of his childhood, however, induced a move back to Bredfield, where he died on 23 April 1895. He was buried two days later in Woodbridge cemetery. Once a well-paid architect, long retirement drained his resources, and he died intestate and impoverished.<br>
