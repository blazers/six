<span class="headword">Swein Asleiffson</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1171?), <span class="occ">pirate</span>, was the son of Olaf Hrolfsson of Gairsay, chieftain on Orkney and steward of Caithness, and of Asleif, described as &#145;a wise woman, of good family and strongest character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, trans. Taylor, 218). His exploits are known almost exclusively from <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>. Some, such as the killing of Somerled of Argyll, are certainly fictitious, and the chronology of Swein's life must be treated as conjectural. Nevertheless, his existence is confirmed by the account of his great-grandson contained in <span class="italic">Sturlunga saga</span>. Moreover, <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> was written soon after Swein's death and includes some information which can be corroborated.<br>
<br>Swein's youth was presumably spent on his father's estates, Gairsay in Orkney and Duncansby in Caithness. In late December 1135 his father, Olaf, was killed by an enemy of Earl Paul of Orkney and Caithness, and Swein's (perhaps elder) brother, Valthjof, was drowned while sailing from his estate on Stronsay. That Swein became known as Asleif's son may have been in reference to his mother's strong character, or to the fact that he was left fatherless at a young age. Soon after, Swein was outlawed by Earl Paul for killing a member of the latter's bodyguard. He fled to the Hebrides, then joined Paul's half-sister Margaret and her Scottish husband, Maddad, earl of Atholl. In the spring of 1136 Swein returned to Orkney, kidnapped Paul, and took him to Atholl. The earldom immediately fell to a Norwegian claimant, Rognvald Kali Kolsson.<br>
<br>Paul was subsequently maimed or killed so that Harald, the young son of Margaret and Maddad, might become joint earl of Orkney with Rognvald. This plan may have been conceived with David I to enhance Scottish influence in the Scandinavian north. <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> records that a Scottish bishop, John (possibly David's tutor, the bishop of Glasgow), travelled to Orkney in 1138 to formalize Harald's recognition. Hopes of influencing events in Caithness and Orkney would explain the assistance which King David and his successor, Malcolm IV, allegedly gave Swein on three later occasions.<br>
<br>By <i>c</i>.1139 Swein took over the lands of his father and brother; he became one of Rognvald's chieftains and (perhaps slightly later) was made his steward in Caithness. His sister, Ingigerd, married Thorbjorn, the young Earl Harald's councillor, and it may be at this time that Swein was briefly married to Ragnhild Ogmund's-Daughter, who bore Olaf, his first son. Swein wreaked vengeance on the faction responsible for his father's death, burning their house at Helmsdale in Sutherland. He then gave assistance to the Hebridean who had sheltered him while outlawed. This expedition, which raided Wales and Lundy island, led to his second marriage, to Ingirid Thorkel's-Daughter, a wealthy widow from the Isle of Man related to Earl Harald. They had a son, Andres (who married a sister of Bishop Bjarni of Orkney), and several unnamed daughters.<br>
<br>The couple were betrayed by Swein's Hebridean host and erstwhile ally, and returned to Orkney. After a retaliatory raid to the Hebrides, Swein angered several Orcadian chiefs, including his brother-in-law Thorbjorn, by claiming a disproportionate share of plunder. Earl Rognvald attempted to settle the dispute, until Margad (Swein's deputy in Caithness) killed one of the earl's supporters. <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> claims that Swein refused to turn Margad, a companion since his youth, over to Rognvald and the slighted chiefs. After a siege near Freswick in Caithness, Swein and Margad escaped to David I, who arranged a settlement.<br>
<br>Swein's influence diminished after 1151, when Rognvald travelled to Jerusalem leaving Earl Harald and Thorbjorn in control. Feud arose when Swein's brother Gunnar was outlawed by Harald for having an affair with the latter's mother. Swein intercepted Harald's revenues, and subsequently retreated to the Scottish king to have his rights in Caithness recognized by a higher authority. He then joined Erlend, a new claimant to the earldoms, and took command of his campaign. However, after initial success, Erlend was killed during an attack by Harald and Rognvald (who returned in 1153) in December 1154.<br>
<br>Rognvald invited Swein to join him and arranged a settlement. The chieftain gave up half his lands, his warship, and 2 gold marks, but warned that &#145;this settlement will hold best if I am not treated disrespectfully&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, trans. Taylor, 322). When Harald had Swein's house on Gairsay occupied, Swein was prepared to burn it, thinking that the earl was inside, but was persuaded that his own wife and daughters, who were within, would not be let out, and rather than burn them he disarmed Harald's men. The earl was not in fact there, and Swein's wife, Ingirid, would not betray the whereabouts of her kinsman Harald. Swein ran off Harald's ale and left with Ingirid and their daughters. A lasting settlement was arranged in 1155. Immediately afterwards, Rognvald returned his share of Swein's confiscated property, and Harald soon did the same. Swein later fostered Harald's son Haakon on Gairsay, and built a large drinking hall there.<br>
<br>Swein maintained a large retinue on the proceeds of piracy. According to <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> he died when raiding in Ireland, one autumn between 1165 and 1180, through falling into a pit trap after securing Dublin's nominal surrender. His pious death-speech, out of character for this aggressively worldly figure, has been interpreted as a late addition to the saga. An unsuccessful Orcadian attack on Dublin is dated to 1171 by Gerald of Wales, the annals of Ulster, and other sources. In these accounts, however, the perpetrator is called John the Mad, and is described as assisting the ousted king of Dublin. Moreover, Gerald places these events around Whitsun (16 May) and states that John was killed in battle. The date of Swein's death thus remains, like most of the details of his life, conjectural. His exciting life is the subject of Eric Linklater's novel <span class="italic">The Ultimate Viking</span> (1955).<br>
