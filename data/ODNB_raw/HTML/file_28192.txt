<span class="headword">Venner,  Tobias</span>  (1577&#150;1660), <span class="occ">physician and medical writer</span>, was born near North Petherton, Somerset. Details of his early life and family are obscure, but at the age of eighteen he became an undergraduate at St Alban's Hall, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 1 February 1599. Venner then returned to Somerset and in 1601 married Agnes Jeffrye (<i>d</i>. 1634) at Bridgwater, having established himself as a medical practitioner in the area; they had a daughter and three sons. The girl died while still young and was buried at North Petherton in 1618.<br>
<br>By the time he obtained his BM and DM degrees in 1613, Venner was already visiting Bath between spring and autumn when the annual influx of the sick provided a lucrative trade for visiting physicians. Bath's hot mineral springs enjoyed a reputation for the successful treatment of skin problems, paralytic disorders, and painful conditions. The spa was popular with people from all ranks of society but bathing was confined to just three months of the year, so avoiding the hottest and coldest seasons, which were considered dangerous, though Venner challenged the wisdom of this statement in his publication <span class="italic">The Bathes of Bathe</span> (1620). Several earlier writers had published books about bathing which featured Bath but Venner was the first to write exclusively about the city's spa. His book undoubtedly helped to promote his image as a balneological specialist and encouraged visitors to consult a trained medical practitioner rather than one of the many quacks and charlatans who pervaded the city.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Bathes of Bathe</span> accompanied the initial part of another work by Venner on the preservation of health, entitled <span class="italic">Via recta ad vitam longam</span>, the final part of which he completed two years later. The book followed a traditional format, and discussed how the six &#145;non-naturals&#146; (environment, diet, sleep, exercise, excretion, and the passions of the mind) affected the balance of the four humours (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile). Venner advocated the consumption of bran to prevent constipation, and regular cleaning of the teeth to prevent tooth decay and bad breath. He cautioned against drinking water conveyed through lead piping. He also published <span class="italic">A Briefe &hellip; Treatise Concerning the Taking of the Fume of Tobacco</span> (1621). Although he personally disliked its &#145;detestable savour&#146; and deplored its immoderate recreational use, he recommended tobacco-smoking as a means of improving digestion and countering the malign effects of cold, misty weather and contagious air.<br>
<br>By 1630 the improvements which had been carried out to the bathing facilities at Bath were attracting even more patients and doctors. Venner was by then well established in the city, where he leased property near what was known as the Hot Bath. He continued his links with Bridgwater and rented land at Rhode, a small hamlet to the west of the town. His books were selling well and his three sons had graduated in medicine from Oxford University. However, within the space of three years Venner's wife and eldest son both died. His second wife, Mary Parker, also predeceased him, in 1646.<br>
<br>At the age of seventy-five, Venner was appointed physician to the Scudamore charity. This was a fund set up by Viscount John Scudamore in memory of his wife to provide free medical advice to poor strangers arriving in Bath and also to patients admitted to Bellot's Hospital, which had been founded in 1609 expressly to provide accommodation near the Hot Bath.<br>
<br>A contemporary biographer wrote rather disparagingly that whereas some men had guts in their brains, Dr Venner's brains were in his guts. Venner's writings suggest that he was a man of moderate habits and piety, so it was not surprising that during the Commonwealth period he espoused the puritan cause. His longevity certainly served to prove the efficacy of his regimen: he died at Bath on 27 March 1660 in his eighty-third year. He was buried in Bath Abbey, where for many years a monument, which is mentioned in Pepys's diary, commemorated his beneficence. He survived all his children; no Venners were mentioned in his will and he left no property, only money and a few named items which were bequeathed to various members of the Parker family, to which he was related through his second wife.<br>
