<span class="headword">Finch, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1558&#150;1625), <span class="occ">author and lawyer</span>, was the third born but second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9443/', "Sir Thomas Finch (d. 1563)")</script> of Eastwell, Kent, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19472/', "Sir Thomas Moyle")</script>. After the death of Henry's soldier father his mother married the puritan lawyer and member of parliament Nicholas St Leger, who in 1572 arranged for his stepson's admission to Christ's College, Cambridge, under Laurence Chaderton. Besides consolidating Finch's godly zeal, his tutor encouraged him to study Hebrew and embrace the dialectical method of the French philosopher Peter Ramus, whose influence pervades a Latin commentary on Horace's <span class="roman">Odes</span> presented to his stepfather in 1577. After graduating BA and serving briefly as sub-lector of Christ's, Finch entered Gray's Inn. There his legal studies led to the composition (<i>c</i>.1585) of &#145;Nomotexnia&#146;, a brief but ambitious treatise which sought to systematize English common law along Ramist lines, as well as bringing it into closer conformity with the laws of Moses.<br>
<br>The precise date of Finch's call to the bar is unknown, but it possibly occurred during a reading in Lent 1585. Following his mother's death in 1587 Finch (now married to Ursula, the daughter of John Thwaites, of Boxwell, Kent, with whom he had a son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9428/', "Edward Finch")</script>) began a protracted legal struggle with his elder brother Moyle over the family's Kentish estates. While this bitter dispute conceivably led to Henry's future bankruptcy, for the moment his rising professional and public stature were signalled by appointments as standing counsel to the city of Canterbury in 1590, and to the Cinque Ports in 1593, when he also became an ancient of Gray's Inn (where he served as inn of chancery reader), and won a fierce electoral contest for one of Canterbury's two parliamentary seats. Here, and again in 1597, Finch emerged as the chief House of Commons spokesman for a now somewhat defensive puritan cause. He thereby confirmed a stance dating back to 1584, when he had participated prominently in a Kentish delegation's protests to Archbishop Whitgift against the suspension of such preaching ministers as Josiah Nicholls, who probably contributed the preface and extensive marginalia to a Ramist exposition of Calvinist theology which Finch published anonymously in 1590 as <span class="italic">The Sacred Doctrine of Divinitie</span>.<br>
<br>Finch's public identification with zealous protestantism helps to explain his failure to win further promotion over the first decade of the new century, apart from his call to the bench of Gray's Inn in 1604, and inclusion on the commission of the peace for Canterbury in 1608 (he had served as JP for the county of Kent since the early 1590s). Domestic and financial distractions doubtless contributed to his relatively low profile, as did also the legal and theological studies which bore fruit in 1613 with the appearance of two books, the only examples of Finch's writings to be published under their author's name in his lifetime. <span class="italic">The Sacred Doctrine of Divinitie</span> was a self-censored reissue of the text of 1590, without marginalia, preface, or specifically presbyterian content, but adding in some versions an obsequious signed dedication to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere; it also included a substantial treatise on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> as prefiguring Christ's revelation. <span class="italic">Nomotexnia; Cestascavoir: un description del common ley Dangleterre solonque les rules del art</span>, a handsome law-French folio with a fulsome dedication to James I, expands the two books of the 1580s manuscript to four, adds copious explanatory material and citations, but drops all explicit reference to remodelling English law along Mosaic lines. Comparison of this volume, the posthumously published English <span class="italic">Law, or, A Discourse Thereof</span> (1627), and numerous manuscript variants indicates that the law-French text of 1613 actually postdates all surviving English drafts as the final stage of Finch's prolonged efforts to formulate a comprehensive overview of England's common law.<br>
<br>In 1614 Finch returned again to parliament, this time for the borough of St Albans, thanks to the patronage of Francis Bacon, his colleague and close contemporary at both Cambridge and Gray's Inn. Finch's energetic service was rewarded shortly after the Addled Parliament's dissolution by promotion to serjeant. Within two years more he became king's serjeant and was knighted, although missing a Welsh judgeship. In 1617 he also gained the high stewardship of Faversham, having held an equivalent position at Sandwich since 1613; in 1619 he was mentioned as a possible chief baron of the exchequer. Unfortunately Finch's financial difficulties had now reached crisis point, exacerbated by a failed attempt to pay off his debts with profits from the office of <i>custos brevium</i> in king's bench. Although a chancery injunction protected Finch and his barrister sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9438/', "John Finch")</script> and Nathaniel, from common-law actions launched by their creditors, this expedient was cited in the parliament of 1621 among the grounds for Bacon's impeachment. Yet Finch was nevertheless asked, although not a member of the house, to help the Commons' committee charged with codifying statute law, a formidable project yet &#145;being in some readiness by the private studie of Serjeant Finch&#146;  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 4.48) on a working party initiated by Bacon five years before.<br>
<br>Finch's financial problems and law reform activities were now temporarily overshadowed by reaction to his last and most controversial publication, <span class="italic">The Worlds Great Restauration, or, The Calling of the Jewes</span>, which appeared in March 1621. This bulky volume of scriptural exegesis foretold the imminent return of the twelve tribes of Israel to the Holy Land and the establishment of a universal Judaeo-Christian empire as a glorious end in itself, not merely a prelude to Christ's second coming. His book was condemned by convocation and the high commission, and its author briefly imprisoned in the Fleet; according to a contemporary joke, he &#145;so enlarged the future amplitude of the Jewish state that thereby he occasioned a confining to himself&#146;  (Katz, 96). Yet after a formal and somewhat vague apology, Finch resumed practice, remaining king's serjeant (his patent renewed at Charles I's accession), and serving as legal adviser to the newly appointed lord keeper, Bishop Williams. Nor do his professional pursuits seem to have been further disrupted before he succumbed to the plague at his sister's house at Boxley on 11 October 1625. He was buried at Boxley two days later. When John Finch became serjeant in 1634, his father was remembered as &#145;excellently lerned in the lawes of the realme, and a great linguist and generall scholer&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Serjeants</span>, 372); in the next century Blackstone acknowledged Finch's &#145;happy progress in reducing the elements of the law from their former chaos to a regular methodical science&#146;  (Blackstone, iv&#150;vi).<br>
