<span class="headword">Docking,  Thomas  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1270), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and ecclesiastical writer</span>, was born at Docking, Norfolk, and may have entered the Franciscan order at Norwich. He had certainly become a Franciscan by 1252&#150;3, when Adam Marsh (<i>d</i>. 1259) wrote a letter asking the provincial minister to assign Docking the <span class="roman">Bible</span> of a deceased friar. In this letter Marsh described Docking as &#145;distinguished by good morals and pleasant manners, a clear hand, great learning and eloquence&#146;  (Brewer, 359&#150;60). Docking was at various times among the pupils of Robert Grosseteste (<i>d</i>. 1253), Adam Marsh, and Roger Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1294), and went on to fulfil his earlier promise by becoming seventh lector to the Oxford Franciscans (<i>c</i>.1262&#150;5), succeeding John of Wales (<i>d</i>. 1285). Like John, he was not a philosopher, but rather a moralist and theologian. He remained in Oxford after his time as lector, and was among the speakers during the controversy between the Friars Preacher and the Friars Minor at Oxford in 1269. He was later warden of Norwich, and died <i>c</i>.1270.<br>
<br>Docking was a prolific writer, his works being both lengthy and numerous. Although enthusiasm for his works waned in the fourteenth century, being given rather to the Paris theologian Nicholas de Lyre, interest in Docking did revive in the fifteenth century. His commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> (now lost) was well known in the middle ages, as was his &#145;Biblical grammar&#146;, also now lost. His commentary on <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span> survives in five manuscripts, his commentary on <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> in two. He also left commentaries on nine of the <span class="roman">Pauline epistles</span>, and parts of commentaries on <span class="roman">Corinthians</span>, <span class="roman">Luke</span>, and <span class="roman">Job</span>.<br>
<br>Docking has been described as having a mania for encyclopaedic lore: this was an enthusiasm shared by a number of Oxford friars of his period. His lengthy commentaries show a wide range of interests. He commented extensively on social conditions, children, young people, physical sciences including optics, law, the beauties of natural scenery, and many other topics, quite apart from his theological interests. In many ways he tended to accept the social conditions of his time, but he did make some political comments that can seem pointed, considering that he was lecturing at Oxford in the 1260s, at the time of the barons' wars. When he wrote that &#145;it seems to me &hellip; that if some man who is prudent and well-fitted for the business of rule &hellip; should aspire to the dignity of ruling for &hellip; the benefit of the subjects, his aim is good&#146;  (Little, <span class="italic">Grey Friars</span>, 278 n.4), he may have been referring to Simon de Montfort.<br>
<br>Docking showed himself acquainted with a wide range of sources. He quotes a number of classical writers&#151;mainly poets apart from Cicero&#151;many anonymous medieval verses, and Bernard Sylvestris. Philosophy was represented by Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Boethius, Ptolemy, Pliny, and Pseudo-Dionysius. Docking refers to very many ecclesiastical writers, together with John of Salisbury, Alexander Neckham, and, most unusually, the <span class="italic">De prescientia Dei</span> of Bartholomew, bishop of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1184). Guillaume d'Auxerre and Robert Grosseteste are mentioned infrequently, and Adam Marsh not at all.<br>
<br>Docking was first quoted by the Franciscan John Russel, who cited the &#145;Biblical grammar&#146; in 1292. Later Franciscans who also quoted his works included William of Nottingham (<i>c</i>.1312), John Lathbury (<i>c</i>.1350), and William Woodford (<i>c</i>.1373), while William Gray, bishop of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1478), had copies of Docking's works made for his library in the mid-fifteenth century.<br>
