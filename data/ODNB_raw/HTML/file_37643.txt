<span class="headword">K&ouml;nig,  Karl</span>  (1902&#150;1966), <span class="occ">paediatrician and educationist</span>, was born on 25 September 1902 in Vienna, Austria, the only child of Aron Ber (Adolf) K&ouml;nig, shoe shop owner, of Vienna, and his wife, Bertha Fischer, whose father was a dressmaker in Iglau, Austria. He was educated at secondary school in Vienna and at the University of Vienna, where he graduated in medicine in 1927. His medical special interests were embryology, paediatrics, and homoeopathy. These, combined with a particular interest in curative education for children with mental and physical handicaps, he developed over the next eleven years in the course of attachments to children's hospitals and homes in Austria, Switzerland, and Silesia (in Germany at that time), and, by 1936, in private practice in Vienna. In 1929 he married Tilla, daughter of Ludwig Maasberg, cloth merchant of Gnadenfrei, Silesia; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Following the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, K&ouml;nig went to London, then to north-east Scotland. When war broke out he had to endure four months' internment as an enemy alien. In late 1940 he established at the estate of Camphill, near Aberdeen, a small residential school for children in need of special care. He was joined there by a succession of members of a group of young Viennese associates, fellow exiles from Europe, who were attracted by K&ouml;nig's vision of therapeutic residential communities where children with learning difficulties and behaviour problems arising from organic disorders and emotional disturbances could receive a broad education to the fullest extent that their individual capabilities would allow, within a caring, sharing, self-governing, Christian &#145;family&#146; setting.<br>
<br>K&ouml;nig had from student days interested himself deeply in the life and works of Rudolf Steiner (1861&#150;1925), the Austrian philosopher and founder of anthroposophy. Steiner's insights into the nature of human handicap, within his concept of the true spiritual nature of all people, inspired K&ouml;nig and his unremunerated co-workers to plan practical implementation of many novel concepts of teaching, learning, and healing for young people with handicaps&#151;up to the age of about nineteen.<br>
<br>But K&ouml;nig's interest in schools spread predictably to provision for disabled people beyond school age. By 1955 he had founded, on an estate at Botton in Yorkshire, the first of many Camphill village communities, with emphasis again on the importance of the individual, on living with total dignity in &#145;family&#146; households, on the provision of workshops for the making of marketable goods, and on cultural, artistic, and spiritual activities in generous measure.<br>
<br>That both kinds of Camphill therapeutic communities, schools and villages, increased in number in several countries both in and after K&ouml;nig's lifetime&#151;by 1987 there were over seventy centres in eighteen countries&#151;was testimony to their success in answering a need, albeit continuously in pioneering mode and therefore not without mistakes. It was testimony also to the founder's vision, dynamic personality, and restless energy. K&ouml;nig was small in stature, could be testy, and was impatient of any blocking of his plans. He had massive difficulties to overcome, concerned with funding, the medical profession, and not least the rough reception he got in wartime in what, in a letter written two weeks before he died, he called the &#145;human desert in the North of Scotland&#146;. But in all his face-to-face contacts with disabled people&#151;and with worried parents&#151;he radiated a great warmth of strong, friendly reassurance. The many lectures he gave throughout his life were delivered, noteless, in an attractive broken English that spellbound his audiences. In 1963 he received the gold medal of the Tutzinger star at Tutzing, Germany. K&ouml;nig died in &Uuml;berlingen, Lake Constance, Germany, on 27 March 1966.<br>
