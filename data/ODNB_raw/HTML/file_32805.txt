<span class="headword">Wet,  Christiaan Rudolph  de</span>  (1854&#150;1922), <span class="occ">army officer and politician in the Orange Free State</span>, born at Leeuwkop, Smithfield district, in the Orange Free State, on 7 October 1854, was the sixth son of Jacobus Ignatius de Wet, of Dewetsdorp, and Aletta Susanna Margaretha Strijdom; he belonged to the sixth generation of the family settled in the Cape. He was privately educated and in 1865, aged eleven, accompanied his father to the frontier during the Basuto War. In 1873 he married Cornelia Margaretha (1856&#150;1936), daughter of Isaak Johannes Christian Kruger, of Bloemfontein; they had five sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Strongly opposed to British annexation of the Transvaal republic (1877), de Wet served with the republican forces in the various engagements during the Anglo-Transvaal War (1880&#150;81) which culminated in the British disaster on Majuba Hill (27 February 1881). After retrocession of the Transvaal, de Wet farmed there for some years, and in 1885 was elected to represent Lydenburg in the republican Volksraad. Ill-suited to routine, however, he soon resigned, ultimately returning to the Free State.<br>
<br>In 1889 de Wet rode with an armed force to Bloemfontein to protest against the building of a railway line from the coast. His vigorous political methods were noted and approved, and he became a member of the Free State Volksraad until 1898.<br>
<br>In the South African War, in October 1899, de Wet was conscripted as an ordinary burgher and sent to the Natal frontier. He gained military distinction, when, as an acting commander with 300 men, he attacked a 1000-strong British force which had left Ladysmith and halted at Nicholson's Nek on 30 October. De Wet captured the whole force, scoring the first important success of the campaign. On 7 December he was promoted to the rank of field general on the western borders of the Free State, where British troops were massing for the relief of Kimberley. There General Piet Cronj&eacute; was supreme commander, but, despite de Wet's efforts to guide and later to rescue him, Cronj&eacute; made tactical errors which led to his capture by Lord Roberts and surrender at Paardeberg on 27 February 1900. Meanwhile de Wet had further distinguished himself by capturing Roberts's convoy at Waterval on 13 February and was appointed commander-in-chief of the Free State forces. The republican cause and the morale of the commandos had been undermined by surrender and desertion but de Wet, supported by Martinus Steyn, president of the Orange Free State, and by General De la Rey, rallied and reassembled his forces. On 31 March he ambushed Colonel R. G. Broadwood's mounted brigade at Sanna's Post, outside Bloemfontein, and on 4 April defeated a British detachment at Reddersburg.<br>
<br>As the war moved to the Transvaal, de Wet remained behind British lines and re-established the fighting spirit of his men. He and the Boer Transvaal leaders chose guerrilla tactics, of which de Wet became a skilled exponent. With a few thousand followers he kept the field for the next two years against tremendous odds, to the despair and admiration of his opponents. He was still undefeated, his reputation worldwide, when, as acting president of the Orange Free State for one day, he signed the treaty of Vereeniging in 1902, ending the war.<br>
<br>After the war de Wet visited Europe with his fellow Boer generals and peace negotiators, and, responsible government granted to South Africa in 1907, he was elected a member of the first parliament of the Orange River Colony and appointed minister of agriculture. He was a delegate to the Union Convention of 1908&#150;9 and a member of the union defence council under General Louis Botha. He left politics after union in 1910.<br>
<br>In 1911 Botha and General J. B. M. Hertzog disagreed on South Africa's relations with the British empire. De Wet supported Hertzog and the movement towards secession and re-establishment of the republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal. He resigned from the defence council in 1913. After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Botha announced his intention of invading German South-West African territory with South African troops in alliance with the British. Already hostile to the expedition, de Wet was influenced by his mistaken belief that Botha's government had ordered the death of his fellow wartime commander and friend General De la Rey, shot by accident on 15 September. De Wet and General C. F. Beyers, the leader of the Transvaal rebels, planned armed revolt. On 24 October Beyers raised the standard in the north, and two days later de Wet followed suit in the Free State. Thousands responded. Botha, however, summoned his supporters, took the field in person, and swiftly defeated Beyers (27 October). He then turned upon de Wet, who was in hiding at Mushroom Valley in the central Free State, and dispersed de Wet's forces (12 November). De Wet resorted to his old guerrilla tactics but in the era of the motor vehicle Botha was able to harry and hustle the mounted commandos, giving them and their horses no rest. Within ten days de Wet was fleeing westward, with only a handful of men, to the Kalahari Desert and German territory. However, on 2 December Botha captured de Wet on the farm Waterberg in the Kuruman district. Beyers had died the previous week while trying to cross the Vaal River, and with both its leaders accounted for the uprising was soon stamped out.<br>
<br>Found guilty of high treason at Bloemfontein on 15 June 1915, de Wet was sentenced to six years' imprisonment and fined &pound;2000. After public protest, Botha released him on parole and he was allowed to return to his farm in the Free State. He lived quietly, dying on the farm Klipfontein, Dewetsdorp, on 3 February 1922. He was buried at the Vrouemonument (&#145;women's monument&#146;) at Bloemfontein beside his old leader President Steyn. He published an account of his campaigns of 1899&#150;1902; an English edition, entitled <span class="italic">Three Years' War</span>, appeared in 1902.<br>
