<span class="headword">Cursiter,  Stanley</span>  (1887&#150;1976), <span class="occ">painter, museum director, and cartographer</span>, was born on 29 April 1887 at Kirkwall, Orkney, the fourth of four children of John Scott Cursiter (1850&#150;1896), baker and spirit merchant, and his wife, Mary Johan, daughter of John Thomson of Newark in Sanday. Educated at Kirkwall grammar school (1893&#150;1904), at the age of thirteen Cursiter gained a certificate in advanced building construction.<br>
<br>Cursiter moved to Edinburgh in 1904, where, unable to afford training as an architect, he undertook a five-year apprenticeship with McLagen and Cumming, chromolithographers. Encouraged by the firm to attend classes at Edinburgh School of Art, Cursiter also received tuition from the Scottish designer W. S. Black in 1904, and, during a brief period at the Royal College of Art, London, from the printmaker W. R. Lethaby in 1908. After 1909 he worked successfully as a designer and began to paint. He was elected a member of the Society of Scottish Artists (SSA) while still a student; his early paintings were of models dressed in costumes he had made for them, for example <span class="italic">Woman in White</span> (Fleming-Wyfold Art Foundation, London), or nude, which found a ready market.<br>
<br>In 1914 Cursiter joined the 1st battalion of the Scottish Rifles (Cameronians). On 14 October 1916 he married a fellow Orcadian, the violinist Phyllis Eda Hourston (1888&#150;1975); they had one daughter, Margaret. A week later he was in the front line on the Somme. Ill health prevailed and he was eventually transferred to the field survey battalion to print maps. There Cursiter developed a revolutionary way of transferring vital information from aerial photographs of enemy troop movements to maps, cutting crucial production time from six weeks to twenty-four hours. He subsequently designed a portable printing press to run from a lorry motor. Demobilized in 1919, he left the army with two mentions in dispatches and was made a military OBE.<br>
<br>Cursiter continued to paint, dividing his time between Edinburgh and Orkney. In 1920, on account of continuing poor health, he moved to Cassis in the south of France for six months, producing a fine series of landscapes. His love of geology and antiquities, his passion for architecture, combined with his extensive knowledge and experience of printing techniques and cartography, bestowed a unique textural, structural quality to his work such as in <span class="italic">Red Lacquer</span> (1922; Pier Arts Centre, Stromness, Orkney).<br>
<br>In 1925 Cursiter became keeper of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, under the directorship of Sir James Caw. He continued to paint, and was elected associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1927 and member in 1937. As ever, Cursiter's keen intellect, commitment, and problem-solving skills had far-reaching results. Picture conservation became an early preoccupation. He completely redesigned heating, humidity control, hanging space, and lighting to minimize the risk of fire in the very awkward Victorian Gothic building. As director of the National Gallery of Scotland from 1930, his collaboration with restorer Martin de Wild of Haarlem and the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, led to the development of a significant new and advanced method of wax relining technique. Cursiter also established a restoration department, redesigned lighting, and designed interior pillars modelled on the famed ancient Greek monument of Lysicrates. He made a working scale-model of the galleries, including scale copies of every picture, and designed and made sliding metal screens for easy storage and retrieval of pictures. In short, he revolutionized the traditional time-consuming way of rehanging a collection.<br>
<br>In 1938 Cursiter drew up plans for a new art centre, incorporating a gallery for modern and contemporary art, craft, industrial design, and a historical collection of Scottish art. He also envisaged that this centre would, had it been built, include facilities for film, performance, and sound, with a travelling exhibitions department. During the Second World War he first secured the dispersal of the national collection and for a short time returned to military cartography as a trainer at the Ordnance Survey, Southampton. The deterioration of the national collection in storage hastened his return to Edinburgh. For the remainder of the war he organized over eighty ground-breaking exhibitions in the empty galleries: &#145;Art of the Allies&#146;; the Scottish colourists, S. J. Peploe and F. C. B. Cadell; &#145;Women's Work&#146;, which showed peacetime paintings and embroideries alongside their wartime activities; and over twenty exhibitions of children's art which raised the profile of art teaching in Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1948 Cursiter resigned as director and from his various committees and returned to painting. He received many honours that year, including appointment as CBE. On the strength of one portrait commission, <span class="italic">Robert Wilson, Chairman of Heriot Watt College</span> (1948; Heriot Watt University), Cursiter found himself launched on a successful portrait career. As royal painter and limner in Scotland (1948) he subsequently painted <span class="italic">The Queen Receiving the Honours of Scotland in St Giles Cathedral</span> and a portrait of the queen mother. An art historian, he wrote two notable books: in 1947, a tribute to Samuel John Peploe (1871&#150;1935), <span class="italic">An Intimate Memoir of an Artist and of his Work</span>, and in 1949 <span class="italic">Scottish Art at the Close of the Nineteenth Century</span>. An autobiography, <span class="italic">Looking back: a Book of Reminiscences</span>, was published privately in 1974.<br>
<br>An intelligent, articulate, well-read but modest man, Cursiter viewed his achievements as a series of fortuitous coincidences of whom he met and of opportunities presented. In 1911 Cursiter visited Roger Fry's first, controversial post-impressionist exhibition at the Grafton Galleries; he recalled, &#145;I got the shock of my life. Here was painting and colour as I had never imagined it&#146;  (Cursiter, 44). Returning the next day, Cursiter was introduced to Roger Fry and Clive Bell, and promptly arranged to borrow some twenty pictures for the next SSA exhibition in Edinburgh. The exhibition was a cultural landmark, bringing the work of C&eacute;zanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin to Scotland for the first time. The effect of these works on Cursiter was decisive. He painted a series of seven radically modern paintings of which <span class="italic">The Sensation of Crossing the Street&#151;the West End, Edinburgh</span> (1913; priv. coll.) is the most far-reaching. Close in style to Italian futurism, Cursiter comments only that the paintings &#145;were not modelled on the work of any individual artist, but just grew out of the search for new methods of expression prompted by contact with the new form of art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stanley Cursiter: Centenary Exhibition</span>, 11).<br>
<br>Orkney, its people and culture, played a deep and influential part throughout Cursiter's life, immortalized in his paintings such as in <span class="italic">Linklater and Greig</span> (1930; Stromness Museum, Orkney), and enriched by his lifelong friendships with Orcadians, the writers Neil Gunn and Eric Linklater, the poet Edwin Muir, and the playwright James Bridie (O. H. Mavor). Retired in Orkney, by 1975 he could no longer paint. Typically his energies went into the preservation of St Magnus's Cathedral and latterly, in collaboration with sculptor Reynold Eunson, the new development of St Rognvald's Chapel. He died of bronchopneumonia on 22 April 1976 at his home, 70 Victoria Street, Stromness, Orkney.<br>
