<span class="headword">Palmer,  George</span>  (1772&#150;1853), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, born on 11 February 1772, was the eldest son of William Palmer (1748?&#150;1821), a London merchant descended from the Palmers of Wanlip, an old Leicestershire family, and his wife, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1747), only daughter of John Horsley, rector of Thorley, Hertfordshire. After schooling at Charterhouse, he served in the navy of the East India Company (1786&#150;99). He married Anna Maria, daughter of William Bund of Wick, Worcestershire, in 1795, and they had three sons, including the legal scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21223/', "William Palmer")</script>, and two daughters, one of whom died young.<br>
<br>In 1802 Palmer entered into partnership with his father, his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21202/', "John Horsley Palmer")</script>, and Captain John(?) Wilson as East India merchants and shipowners at 28 Throgmorton Street in the City of London. This firm was a branch of one of the first and most successful private agencies in India. Founded by Sir John Palmer in the 1770s, it had a large sailing fleet and was greatly respected. As was the custom at that time, the house of Palmer in India had associate partnerships: Palmer and Horsley (later Palmer, Mackillop &amp; Co.) in London, and William Dent &amp; Co. in China. In the late 1820s Palmers suffered an unprecedented bankruptcy brought about by speculation in indigo; debts were well over &pound;400,000. Many houses went down with Palmers, but the London branch was not seriously affected.<br>
<br>George Palmer appeared in public life in London in 1831, when he combined with other shipowners to set up a lobby for the shipping interest. With his experience in naval and merchant shipping, he was well suited to chair the provisional committee. After two years of negotiation with owners in London and the outports, the foundation was laid, and Palmer was chosen to be the first chairman of the General London Ship Owners' Society when it was launched in 1833. It soon became an influential and lasting national institution.<br>
<br>At the same time Palmer was engaged in two matters of global importance. He chaired the provisional committee set up to form and establish rules for a new Lloyd's register of shipping. Under his guidance, the new register emerged in 1834 as a model for shipping all over the world. The next task was to find a standard mode of measuring the capacity of vessels. Some of the principles proposed by Palmer were incorporated by the Admiralty in the <span class="roman">Tonnage and Measuring Act</span> in 1835.<br>
<br>Having unsuccessfully contested South Shields in December 1832, Palmer entered parliament for South Essex in 1836 on the death of the incumbent and held the seat until 1847. As befitted an MP of the Conservative tendency, he fought against what he saw as power being taken from the parishes to the centre, the &#145;cloven hoof&#146; that would deprive individuals of their liberty; but he could not bring himself to take Peel's side when the abolition of the corn laws was debated. His main concern, however, was safety at sea. He chaired two parliamentary inquiries on shipwrecks, and in 1845, against strong opposition, pushed an amendment through that finally settled the law prohibiting timber-laden ships from carrying deck cargoes.<br>
<br>Palmer never forgot the narrow escape he and his crew had from drowning in 1788 in eastern waters; he took a keen interest in the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and in his later life was its vice-chairman for twenty-five years. His own design of a lifeboat was in use until 1858. The institution honoured him with its gold medal a few weeks before his death. He died on 12 May 1853 at Nazing (later Nazeing) Hall, the family home near Epping.<br>
