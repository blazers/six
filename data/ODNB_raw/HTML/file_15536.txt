<span class="headword">Killigrew,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1664&#150;1695), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15534/', "Henry Killigrew (1613&#150;1700)")</script>, dramatist and master of the Savoy Hospital, and his wife, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1683), and was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15535/', "Admiral Henry Killigrew")</script>. He went to sea with his brother, serving as a captain's servant and then as a midshipman in the <i>Mordaunt</i> and the <i>Dragon</i>, both commanded by his brother, between 1684 and 1688. He was appointed lieutenant successively of the <i>Garland</i> (July 1688), the <i>Portsmouth</i> (5 September 1688), and the <i>St Albans</i> (October 1688), one of the ships which accompanied Arthur Herbert, earl of Torrington to Holland in February 1689 to bring Queen Mary to England. In August 1689 he was appointed second lieutenant of the <i>Duke</i>, the flagship of Edward Russell, admiral of the blue. On Russell's recommendation he was promoted captain on 11 April 1690 and appointed to the <i>Sapphire</i>. He did not take part in the battle of Beachy Head but was one of the captains who sat on Torrington's courts martial on 10 December 1690, and who acquitted him. Russell described him in his private list of captains as &#145;a good man, but young&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, MS xd. 451 (98) ). A lieutenant in the first regiment of marines commanded by Henry Killigrew in 1691, in 1693 he was a captain in Danby's marine regiment.<br>
<br>In 1691 Killigrew served in the Irish seas and in the English Channel, and in July captured a large French privateer from St Malo, originally an English merchant ship. From 1692 to March 1693 he was cruising off the Channel Islands, taking a French merchant ship near Jersey in January 1692, and then in the Baltic. While at sea on 23 March 1693 he exchanged commands with the captain of the <i>Crown</i>, moved to the <i>York</i> three months later, and spent June and July cruising in the Mediterranean before moving to the <i>Plymouth</i>. He was highly thought of by Russell, who recognized his potential by appointing him to command a small detached force of five ships in December 1694. He drew up his will on 5 December and, not having married, left his pay from the marine regiment to Thomas Balderstone and his pay as captain of the <i>York</i> to Kenrick Edisbury, a member of the Navy Board, with his brother Henry as executor. On 18 January 1695 he was cruising to the southward of Sardinia when two French men-of-war were sighted, the 60-gun <i>Content</i> and 52-gun <i>Trident</i>. About 3 p.m. the <i>Plymouth</i>, which was ahead of her consorts, engaged the <i>Content</i> and at 3.30 Killigrew, &#145;after he had been in all places &hellip; giving necessary instructions and orders to his lieutenants&#146; and encouraging the seamen, was &#145;wounded mortally in the pit of his stomach by a short bar of Iron about 6 inches long it lodging in his body&#146; (TNA: PRO, ADM 51/3935/1; TNA: PRO, SP 42/5, fol. 1). The <i>Plymouth</i> suffered severely, having been dismasted as well as having the sails and rigging torn to shreds, but the French ships had been delayed until the other English ships came up and, being unable to escape, were both captured, taken into Messina, and afterwards added to the navy. At Messina on 22 January 1695 the <i>Plymouth</i>'s chaplain John Percival preached a funeral sermon over Killigrew, and as his coffin was carried on shore in the <i>Plymouth</i>'s barge, &#145;the ship fired 20 guns by the half minute glass&#146;. Killigrew was buried in a &#145;very pleasant garden on the north side of Messina&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 51/3935/1). After his death his brother Henry asked whether his estate was not entitled to a share of the prize money, but Russell advised that the money was payable only to the captains whose vessels actually took the ships. Killigrew was a popular captain who encouraged and inspired his crew and showed &#145;as much courage, bravery and resolution as could be expected from man&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 42/5, fol. 1).<br>
