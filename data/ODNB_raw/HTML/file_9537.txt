<span class="headword">William fitz Alan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1105&#150;1160), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of Alan son of Flaald (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1114), hereditary steward of the bishops of Dol in eastern Brittany, and Avelina, daughter of Ernulf de Hesdin in Ponthieu, a Domesday tenant-in-chief in ten counties. Alan and Avelina had three sons: Jordan, who inherited the patrimony in Brittany; William, who inherited his father's rich acquisitions (which included &#145;the fee of the sheriff&#146; of Shropshire) and was the direct ancestor of the Fitzalan earls of Arundel; and Walter (<i>d</i>. 1177), who took service with David I of Scotland about 1136 and became his steward, and was the direct ancestor of the Stewart kings of Scotland. William fitz Alan married <i>c</i>.1130 Christina, <i>neptis</i> (a niece or close relative) of Robert, earl of Gloucester. Their son Alan died in his father's lifetime; their daughter Christiana was married in 1170 to Hugh Pantulf of Wem. William married second <i>c</i>.1153 Isabella de Say, daughter and heir of Elias de Say, lord of Clun. Their son William Fitzalan, who was to be the heir to his father's lands, came of age in 1175.<br>
<br>The group of Breton families who had served Henry I before his accession were notably loyal to his memory. Soon after gaining the shrievalty of Shropshire on the death of Pain fitz John in 1137 William fitz Alan was one of a group of magnates who renounced their loyalty to King Stephen in 1138, concurrently with Robert, earl of Gloucester, the leader of what then became the Angevin faction in the civil war. Shrewsbury Castle was held against King Stephen in August 1138, but it fell after a short siege, and Stephen, conscious of criticisms of his leniency after earlier sieges, hanged many of the garrison, probably including William's uncle, the younger Ernulf de Hesdin. William himself escaped the siege, with his wife and children, and attached himself to the Empress Matilda after her arrival in the following year. He was with her at Winchester from March to April 1141, when she was recognized as &#145;lady of the English&#146;, and in the following July and August was with her first at Oxford (when his brother Walter was present with David, king of Scots) and then at Winchester. Writs from the empress show that she viewed him as having some authority in Shropshire in the 1140s; but that authority cannot have been great, and was to diminish. Oswestry, the centre of his barony, was lost to the Welsh by 1149, captured by Madog ap Maredudd of Powys, and Bridgnorth was in the hands of the Mortimers. The small barony of Keevil in Wiltshire, inherited by Avelina, provided a safe haven, for it was close to Devizes where the empress was based after 1142. William was also at Chester, probably in the late 1140s, where he witnessed charters of Earl Ranulf (II).<br>
<br>William fitz Alan survived to benefit from the Angevin succession. He immediately attached himself to Duke Henry on his arrival in 1153, and was with him at Leicester in June 1153 and at Dunstable in January 1154. When Henry (now Henry II) marched against Hugh de Mortimer in July 1155, and recaptured the castles at Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth, William fitz Alan was the chief beneficiary. At Bridgnorth &#145;the king restored his lands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cart. Haughmond</span>, 1371), and William took the homages of his men: a public statement of his power but a recognition also that in the anarchy his lordship had been destroyed. Oswestry was recaptured at about the same time. William fitz Alan accounted as sheriff of Shropshire from July 1155 until his death, which occurred about Easter 1160. What appears to be a deathbed grant shows him at Shrewsbury surrounded by the abbots of Haughmond, Lilleshall, and Buildwas, and the prior of Wenlock, all houses that he had supported with gifts. Haughmond Abbey was the foundation of William fitz Alan, and became the family monastery and mausoleum. He, however, was buried at Shrewsbury Abbey, within the town that was for so many years the focus of his ambition.<br>
