<span class="headword">Grant, Sir  Alexander</span>, fifth baronet  (1705&#150;1772), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born at the Mains of Dalvey, Inverness-shire, on 1 July 1705, the eldest of the three children of Patrick Grant (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1755), a barber and farmer, and his wife, Lydia, of Borlum, a daughter of William Mackintosh and a sister of Brigadier-General William Mackintosh. Little is known of Grant's childhood. Late in his teens he enrolled in an introductory medical course at the University of Aberdeen and upon its completion left for Jamaica. There, in the mid-1720s, he practised medicine and surgery; later he took up the work of a planter. His first recorded land patent appears in May 1730, when he received 300 acres in St Elizabeth parish; one month later he leased 1 acre in Westmoreland parish and opened a store for medicines and provisions. In the same year he entered into a planting partnership with Peter Beckford of Spanishtown. Over the next few years he continued to buy more land in the outlying parishes and in Kingston, where he transferred his medical practice in 1734. There he met and married Elizabeth Cooke (1717&#150;1792), the daughter of Robert Cooke, who had emigrated from Bristol and become a prominent planter.<br>
<br>By 1740 the profits from Grant's merchandising trade were sufficient for him to return to Britain. He settled in London, operating as a general merchant. Initially he entered into a partnership with the Scottish wholesale druggist Alexander Johnston (1698&#150;1775) and worked out of Johnston's shop in Magpie Alley, Fenchurch Street. Johnston supplied food, medicine, and cloth to West Indians, and Grant marketed their sugar. He lived above the counting-house until 1741, when he moved his family to Hatton Garden and in 1746 to Billiter Lane. The partnership lasted until 1753, when they divided their cash and stock. After the dissolution Grant pushed the sale of sugar and the supply of provisions with new vigour and from 9 Billiter Lane built up a global merchandising empire. In addition he moved into two activities that complemented his West Indies trade: slaving and contracting. In 1748 he joined Richard Oswald, Augustus and John Boyd, John Mill, and John Sargent in establishing a slave &#145;factory&#146; on Bance Island, near the mouth of the Sierra Leone River in west Africa. Somewhat later, during the Seven Years' War, Grant began to provision the India Company squadrons; at the end of the 1750s he contracted to victual his majesty's ships at the Halifax naval station. And, after the war, he continued to provision the West India squadron. Grant's enterprises were broad: characteristically he plunged heavily into the funds, development of Scottish forests and fisheries, Greenland whaling, and speculation in Scottish, Nova Scotia, Florida, and Jamaica land, even as he pursued more traditional lines of trade.<br>
<br>In 1748 and 1749 Grant claimed the title to a Nova Scotia baronetcy that had been granted to an ancestor four generations before but had fallen dormant. Towards this end he received from the chief of the clan a grant of the barony of Grangehill, which he renamed Dalvey. But confirmation of the title dragged on until August 1752, when his father was retoured heir. When his father died three years later Grant inherited the title. At this time a prosperous merchant in the City and an affluent member of society with close friends at court, Grant felt free to cultivate political interest. He had previously turned to politics in the early 1750s, but had been defeated in the contest over the Inverness burghs in April 1754, due in large measure to the diffidence of the clan chief and the betrayal of supposed friends. Several years later, when George II died, Sir Alexander found himself &#145;somewhat distinguished&#146; by his friendship with the king and Lord Bute. Helped by such acquaintances, he was unanimously elected as the member for the Inverness burghs in April 1761.<br>
<br>In parliament Grant worked behind the scenes as an adviser and lobbyist. During the 1760s the former sugar planter and navy contractor was widely regarded as one of the best sources on West Indian and Canadian affairs. Yet he was neither vociferous nor visible: he went two years without speaking in the house and, when he did, on 24 March 1763, he merely provided expert testimony on the possible economic effects of the cider tax. He attended the house almost every day that it was in session, and was an inveterate committee-goer. For most of his tenure he was loyal to the ministry in power: initially he sided with Bute and supported Bute's peace; after Bute's fall in 1763, he sided with Grenville, although he maintained close ties to Bute's party; he opposed John Wilkes and the repeal of the cider tax; and after Grenville's fall in 1765 he sided with Rockingham. Yet, in a display of independence, he opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in February 1766. But by that time he was already under fire in Scotland. Due to the machinations of an aspiring nabob, Colonel Hector Munro, Grant was stripped of the provostship of Nairn in October 1765 and of his seat on the Nairn council one year later. Ultimately he filed a complaint in the court of sessions, but to no avail, and he lost his seat to Munro in the general election of 1768.<br>
<br>In 1770 Grant turned his business over to three relatives, but almost immediately he felt he had made a mistake and one year later returned to the counting-house. Yet his presence was fleeting. In June 1772 he was &#145;in a dangerous way&#146;, and in late July he was speechless. He died on 1 August at his house in Great George Street, Westminster, of &#145;a total and gradual decay of nature&#146;. His body was carried on a fishing smack to his home at Dalvey House, near Forres, and buried on 1 September alongside his father.<br>
