<span class="headword">Hedgewar, Keshavrao Baliram</span>  (1889&#150;1940), <span class="occ">Hindu nationalist</span>, was born on 1 April 1889 at Nagpur, Maharashtra (then capital of Central Provinces in British India), the youngest of six children of Balirampant, a poor orthodox Deshastha Brahman priest, and Revatibai. He grew up in a high-caste Hindu milieu where traditions of Maharashtrian Hindu valour against pre-colonial Muslim rulers were being fostered to provide sustenance for an emergent nationalism, that could be both anti-British and anti-Muslim in shifting proportions. Expelled from Nilchiti high school, Nagpur, for anti-British activities inspired in Maharashtra by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Hedgewar studied at Yeotmal national school and (1910&#150;14) the National Medical College, Calcutta, where he is said to have had connections with the Anushilan revolutionary nationalist secret society. He returned to Nagpur permanently in 1914 with a medical degree, but never practised as a doctor. He remained a bachelor. Hedgewar was imprisoned for a year (1921) for participating in the Gandhian non-co-operation movement, but, like his early political mentor, Dr Moonje (principal associate of Tilak in Nagpur), became hostile towards Gandhi's methods and ideals: in particular, in the words of a biographer, for &#145;overemphasising the importance of Muslim participation in the freedom struggle&#146;.<br>
<br>Hedgewar was influenced by the ideals of exclusivist, anti-Muslim Hindu nationalism propounded by V. D. Savarkar in his <span class="italic">Hindutva</span> (1923), and decided to give that ideology a firm organizational basis. The specific contexts for his foundation of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), or National Volunteer Organization, in September 1925 were constituted by acute Hindu&#150;Muslim tensions in Nagpur (where Moonje and Hedgewar had set up a Hindu Sabha and organized a big procession in October 1923 defying a government order not to play music before mosques), and the development of anti-Brahman movements among Hindu lower castes (of which, too, the Nagpur region became a principal centre in the 1920s). The meeting that set up the RSS felt that educated, high-caste Hindus should acquire combat skills themselves, and not depend any longer on lower-caste muscle-men.<br>
<br>The RSS displayed its street-fighting capacities in the September 1927 Nagpur Hindu&#150;Muslim riots in which twenty-two were killed, but concentrated more on a long-term, unostentatious building up of organizational strength through what its founder liked to call &#145;man-making&#146; and &#145;cultural&#146; work. Its exclusively male membership was recruited very young (boys of twelve to fifteen being preferred, with minds like &#145;clean slates&#146;), and organized into locality-based <i>shakhas</i> (branches) which met every day at fixed times for physical training, exposition of a simple Hindu nationalist ideology that was propagated also through rituals and occasional festivals, and the inculcation of the virtues of unquestioning loyalty and obedience. In November 1929 the RSS adopted the principle of &#145;following one leader&#146;, under which Hedgewar became <i>sarsang-chalak</i>, supreme director, on a lifetime basis, of a totally centralized, self-consciously undemocratic structure. In addition, he was given the power to appoint his own successor. The model, supposedly, was that of the patriarchal Hindu joint family, and RSS culture tried to blend martial discipline with familial ideology. Unlike any real family, women remained excluded from RSS membership, but in 1936 Hedgewar agreed to the formation of a subsidiary women's organization, the Rashtrasevika Samiti. Under Hedgewar's successor, M. S. Golwalkar, this system of affiliated organizations, floated and usually controlled by the RSS, proliferated into the &#145;RSS family&#146;, foremost among whose members in the 1990s were the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Viswa Hindu Parishad.<br>
<br>Hedgewar briefly gave up headship of the RSS when he courted arrest in 1930 as part of Gandhi's civil disobedience movement. His RSS biographer, C. P. Bhishikar, explains this in terms of Hedgewar's desire to propagate the ideals of his organization among nationalists in prison. The RSS itself kept consistently aloof from all anti-British movements, and so (except briefly in the Central Provinces in 1932&#150;4, when government servants were banned from joining it) never became an object of colonial repression despite its paramilitary ways. Relations with the other major Hindu nationalist organization, the Hindu Mahasabha patronized by V. D. Savarkar (of which Moonje had become a leader) were initially close, but later became uncertain because of the RSS preference for long-term &#145;cultural&#146;, rather than directly political, work. In 1934, for instance, it lost a prominent organizer, Nathuram Godse, the future assassin of Gandhi, to the Mahasabha because of Hedgewar's refusal to make the RSS a more political body.<br>
<br>Initially confined mainly to Maharashtra, the RSS spread rapidly into northern India as Hindu&#150;Muslim relations worsened there in the late 1930s, and organizers were also sent to the southern provinces by Hedgewar in 1938. There were about 500 <i>shakhas</i> with 60,000 members by 1939, and in 1940 the last &#145;officer's training camp&#146; that Hedgewar was able to address was attended by trainees from every province except Assam, Orissa, and Kashmir. About half the branches, however, were still located in Maharashtra, and recruitment remained largely confined to high-caste, urban middle- and lower middle-class groups. Hedgewar had been in ill health since 1932, and died of high blood pressure in Nagpur on 21 June 1940, having had the satisfaction, as he had stated in his last speech to RSS trainees, of seeing before his eyes &#145;a miniature Hindu Rashtra [Nation]&#146;.<br>
