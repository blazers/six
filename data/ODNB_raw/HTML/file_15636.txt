<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kinnaird <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hoare]</span>,  Mary Jane</span>, Lady Kinnaird  (1816&#150;1888), <span class="occ">philanthropist and a founder of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)</span>, was born on 14 March 1816 at Blatherwick Park, Northamptonshire, the youngest of the six children of William Henry Hoare (1776&#150;1819), of Broomfield House, Battersea, Surrey, and of Louisa Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter of Sir Gerard Noel and Diana, Baroness Barham. Both her parents died in her infancy and she spent her childhood at the Surrey house of her grandfather, Henry Hoare, and, after his death in 1828, at the house of one of her uncles or of her brother Henry, who was her guardian. She was educated by a governess, who did not offer much intellectual stimulus. She was musical, and became a good pianist. Like her future husband, though in her case from a high-church background, she read William Romaine and turned to evangelicalism. She formed the habit of careful <span class="roman">Bible</span> study and of morning prayers, which she was to build upon in later life. When she came of age in 1837 she chose to live with her maternal uncle, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20231/', "Hon. and Revd Baptist Noel (1799&#150;1873)")</script>, then incumbent of St John's Chapel, Bedford Row, London, and was effectively his private secretary. She became very involved with the poor of the area, and worked especially to help women and girls. In 1841 she set up the St John's Training School for Domestic Servants (later moved to the site of Westbourne Day Schools, built by her husband). Through travel with Baptist Noel she acquired a lifelong interest in the development of protestantism on the continent. Merle d'Aubign&eacute; and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Monod were to visit her frequently in London (and she later helped to raise money to erect a Calvin memorial hall in Geneva, as well as supporting the protestant cause in Italy and Bohemia). At this time she was said to be quiet and to have little small talk, but to be keen on debate and to be animated when a subject arose which interested her. She was to become the driving force behind a formidable range of evangelical initiatives, and to acquire a reputation for forcefulness.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1843 in Hornsey church, Mary Jane Hoare married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15631/', "Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, tenth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture and second Baron Kinnaird of Rossie (1814&#150;1887)")</script>. They were to work closely together on projects of common concern, and drew upon a wide range of powerful family connections. They settled in London, and the house to which they moved soon after their marriage, 35 Hyde Park Gardens, became a great philanthropic centre. On Wednesday evenings the couple held salons to discuss missionary, educational, and reforming activities at home and abroad. Mary Jane Kinnaird worked on the editing of a volume of family prayers, for which she solicited contributions from nearly all of the most famous evangelical clergy of the day, with the aim of raising money to build a chapel for the Lock Hospital and Asylum in which both she and her husband were interested. In 1856 the Kinnairds moved to 2 Pall Mall East, above the bank where Arthur Kinnaird worked. There they were to continue to provide the focus of evangelical campaigning initiatives. Mrs Ranyard's council to run the <span class="roman">Bible</span> women met there, with both Arthur and Mary Jane Kinnaird serving on it, and other meetings were convened during the debates over India in the 1850s and the American Civil War. A campaign was launched there in 1871 against the slave trade on the east coast of Africa, and the house was also a centre for the revival movements of 1859&#150;60 and 1873&#150;5. Mary Jane Kinnaird was subsequently much involved in the Mildmay conferences.<br>
<br>Mary Jane Kinnaird would not address public meetings on principle, believing that this was not a woman's role, but she seems to have provided the impetus behind many of the projects which she and her husband sponsored. She may even have written his speeches. The one major issue on which they seem to have differed was that of female suffrage: while he supported it, she opposed it. She organized Thursday afternoon <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading meetings for women and mothers' meetings at her home, and she was active in local causes. She was one of the founders of the British Ladies' Female Emigration Society, and she encouraged the foundation of the Christian Colportage Association. She became particularly well-informed about India and said that when she died India would be found written on her heart. Although the evangelical impulse was uppermost, she recognized the importance of taking the widest possible view of the situation there; she emphasized the urgent need both for public works and for developing civil administration on lines which would limit the racial tensions which she could see increasing in the 1860s. She took a special interest in the condition of women in India, promoting in the 1850s the Indian Female Normal School and Instruction Society, to which was joined a female medical mission in 1872. In 1888 the society had sixty-six schools in India, and its visitors had access to 1353 zenanas. In 1906&#150;7 a school in Lahore which she had worked to support, and which was to become the first women's college in the Punjab, changed its name to the Kinnaird Christian Girls' High School (later Kinnaird College) in her honour.<br>
<br>Mary Jane Kinnaird achieved most in her role in the YWCA. During the Crimean War she was involved with Florence Nightingale (1820&#150;1910) in preparing nurses to be sent out to the field. In 1855 she established a more permanent nurses' home&#151;the North London Home&#151;for girls coming to London. A lending library and other amenities were attached, and it was the first institution of its kind in the capital. In 1861 she proposed the establishment of the United Association for the Christian and Domestic Improvement of Young Women, and by 1871 she had set up two homes and four institutes. Simultaneously Emma Robarts was organizing a very successful women's prayer union. In 1877, the year of Emma Robarts's death, it was decided to merge the two movements under the title of the Young Women's Christian Association. Lord Shaftesbury became president, and Arthur Kinnaird treasurer. On the model of the YMCA it became a national (and subsequently international) movement to establish under Christian auspices institutes, libraries, and educational classes for young women working away from home. A monthly magazine, <span class="italic">Our Own Gazette</span>, was produced at the cover price of 1<i>d</i>., and was owned jointly by Arthur Kinnaird (by then tenth Lord Kinnaird) and Mrs Stephen Menzies of Liverpool, who edited it. It reached a circulation of nearly 100,000. While she was not involved in the active management, Mary Jane Kinnaird remained a pivotal force in the development of the organization. At her death she was president of the YWCA and of the related Factory Helpers' Union. Her husband died on 26 April 1887, and she died on 1 December 1888, at Plaistow Lodge, Plaistow, Kent. She was buried beside her husband in the churchyard at Rossie, Perthshire, the family seat.<br>
<br>The Kinnairds' children were brought up to be as committed philanthropists as their parents. Six survived to adulthood (the first child having died very young): Frederica Georgina (1845&#150;1929), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50297/', "Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird (1847&#150;1923)")</script>, <a name="cosubject_55225"></a><span class="headword">Louisa Elizabeth Kinnaird</span>  (1848&#150;1926)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_50782"></a><span class="headword">Agneta Olivia Kinnaird</span>  (1850&#150;1940)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_55224"></a><span class="headword">Gertrude Mary Kinnaird</span>  (1853&#150;1931)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_50783"></a><span class="headword">Emily Cecilia Kinnaird</span>  (1855&#150;1947)<span class="occ"></span>. The daughters were all educated at home and started taking <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes and mothers' meetings when they were very young, and they acted as secretaries to their parents. They became especially involved with their mother's principal concerns, and the three sisters who did not marry&#151;Louisa, Gertrude, and Emily&#151;were frequent collaborators. Louisa worked alongside her mother in the London Bible and Domestic Mission. Louisa and Emily lived together throughout their lives, and, although Louisa was less dynamic, in the 1880s she represented the YWCA in Plaistow, south-east London. Emily and Gertrude acted as representatives for Rossie Priory. Gertrude worked for the Zenana Bible and Medical Missionary Society, both in London and in India.<br>
<br>Emily Kinnaird, who took on the role of family memoirist, devoted her considerable energies to several causes. She went on a mission to India with Gertrude in 1889, and returned frequently, in 1905&#150;6 again with her sister. She became vice-president of the Scottish branch of the Zenana Bible and Medical Missionary Society. In 1944 she published in Lucknow <span class="italic">My Adopted Country, 1889&#150;1944</span>, an account of her commitment to India. In Britain she was initially inspired to philanthropic work by the work of Catherine Marsh and Elizabeth Garnett among railway navvies, and she maintained this interest, spending one out of every four Sundays in a navvy mission station. She was an elder of Regent Square Presbyterian Church in London. Her main commitment was to the YWCA, on whose behalf she exploited every connection she had. It was reported that she arrived at her friends' houses before breakfast and refused to allow them to eat until she had extracted a cheque from them. She was for twenty-five years (from 1881) honorary secretary of the London division of the YWCA, and in 1906 she became honorary finance secretary of the British organization as a whole. She was also district referee for Forfarshire and Kincardineshire, and vice-president of the Scottish council. As honorary secretary for London she took a leading role in creating the Council of Women Workers (later the National Council of Women), on whose committee she sat for many years. She travelled extensively in representing the YWCA and became a member of the committee of the international YWCA. During the First World War she established more than 300 centres under the aegis of the YWCA to cater for WAACs and for munition and other war workers. She also set up a training home to provide an effective secretariat for the YWCA. As well as teaching the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, she lectured on business methods and public speaking, thus developing her mother's work in a fundamentally new idiom. She made an important contribution towards expanding the YWCA into a larger-scale organization, catering for young women entering a wider range of professions and developing new expectations. In 1918 she was appointed OBE, and in 1920 CBE. She was a lively and tough-minded person, sympathetic to the Labour Party. The only recreation she listed in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> was bicycling, which clearly helped to maintain her vigour through a long life. She died in September 1947.<br>
