<span class="headword">&AElig;thelwine</span> <span class="st"> [Ethelwine, &AElig;thelwine Dei Amicus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 992), <span class="occ">magnate and founder of Ramsey Abbey, Huntingdonshire</span>, was the fourth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8917/', "&#198;thelstan, known as the Half-King (fl. 932&#150;956)")</script>, and his wife, &AElig;lfwyn (<i>d</i>. 986). He was a few years older than the atheling <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8463/', "Edgar")</script>, who was king from 959 to 975 and who had been reared as his foster brother in the same household. &AElig;thelwine succeeded to the ealdordom of East Anglia in 962 after the death of his eldest brother &AElig;thelwold and held it until his own death on 24 April 992. It is not known why &AElig;thelwine, rather than one of his two surviving older brothers, inherited the ealdordom; perhaps it was because King Edgar knew him best. &AElig;thelwold's ealdordom had probably included southern Northumbria within its remit, but responsibility for that province was taken over by Oslac. The remainder of the ealdordom included Cambridgeshire, the southern part of Lincolnshire, and possibly Bedfordshire, all of which were given to &AElig;thelwine. From 984 to 990 he probably also had charge of central and north-west Mercia. During his early years of office &AElig;thelwine was fourth in precedence of the ealdormen witnessing royal diplomas; from 966 onwards he witnessed fifth, from 971 second, and from 983 until his death he headed the lists, with Byrhtnoth in second place.<br>
<br>The politics of Edgar's reign revolved to a large extent around the power struggle that had developed between the East Anglian and Mercian ealdordoms, with rivalry between &AElig;thelwine's family on the one hand and the two brothers &AElig;lfhere, ealdorman of Mercia, and &AElig;lfheah, ealdorman of Wessex, on the other. Both families had ties of kinship with the royal house of Wessex. &AElig;thelwine was the principal lay patron of Benedictine monasticism in England, whence his nickname, Dei Amicus (&#145;Friend of God&#146;). He found a strong supporter in Byrhtnoth, ealdorman of Essex, who also held Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire and may have exercised a general supervision of the Five Boroughs and Northumbria during part of this period. Altogether &AElig;lfhere's influence was dominant in the early years, though differences with &AElig;thelwine sharpened during the &#145;anti-monastic&#146; reaction which followed the death of King Edgar in 975. But &AElig;lfhere died in 983 and his brother-in-law &AElig;lfric Cild (the last important adherent to &AElig;lfhere's party) was banished two years later. Shorn of this opposition, &AElig;thelwine and Byrhtnoth were able to work closely together during the next eight years.<br>
<br>Within his own ealdordom, as in national affairs, &AElig;thelwine exercised his great power no less effectively than his father had done before him. In the pages of the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, and to a lesser extent in the house chronicle of Ramsey Abbey, it is possible to watch him go about his duties; no other ealdorman had his official acts recorded in such detail for posterity. In Cambridgeshire he presided over meetings of the whole shire, of groups of hundreds, and even of a single hundred. Sometimes he sat with the royal reeve, but only once (in spite of what might be expected from the laws) with the diocesan bishop. According to the chronicles, &AElig;thelwine had his hall and kept his court at Upwood near Ramsey. This court would have been concerned with the administration of his family estates rather than with his duties as ealdorman. He held also, on lease from Ely, the lordship of the five and a half hundreds of Wicklaw in Suffolk, probably the greatest franchise then in lay hands.<br>
<br>As might be expected, Ealdorman &AElig;thelwine was a considerable landowner in his own right. Details of most of his properties have not survived, but he and his family laid claims in Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, and there were large estates in Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. With these lands &AElig;thelwine, his three wives&#151;successively &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d (<i>d</i>. 977), &AElig;thelgifu (<i>d</i>. 985), and Wulfgifu (<i>d</i>. 994)&#151;his brother &AElig;lfwold, and his sister-in-law &AElig;lfhild, endowed his foundation at Ramsey.<br>
<br>The monastery owed its origins to the miraculous cure of a bad attack of gout which &AElig;thelwine suffered about 963, a cure which he ascribed to St Benedict. In return he built a tiny wooden church on the Isle of Ramsey in the southern fenlands, near his home at Upwood; here he placed a simple community of three men who aspired to become monks. Shortly afterwards &AElig;thelwine met Oswald, bishop of Worcester, at a funeral at Glastonbury (a foundation strongly supported by &AElig;thelwine's family and where his father had ended his days as a monk). He offered Oswald the site at Ramsey for the building of a major monastery and Oswald sent monks from his own small community at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol. A larger wooden chapel was built, then a stone church with a central and a western tower, which was consecrated in 974. This proved to have inadequate foundations and a second stone church was erected, with conventual outbuildings, and consecrated in 991. This rebuilding, as well as the initial foundation, were handsomely furnished by &AElig;thelwine, who decorated the high altar and installed a magnificent organ, a novelty in England at that time. Soon afterwards, Abbo of Fleury, the greatest scholar of the age, came to instruct the monks in the new learning, which was then transmitted from Ramsey to other reformed English abbeys. For many years Ealdorman &AElig;thelwine and Bishop Oswald met annually at Ramsey to discuss its affairs and foster the quality of its learning.<br>
<br>After a long illness, during which he was cared for by the community, &AElig;thelwine died at Ramsey on 24 April 992 and was buried there. Byrhtferth of Ramsey, in his life of Oswald written two decades later, included a flowery obituary of &AElig;thelwine. A century and a half later, another tribute was paid by an anonymous monk of Ramsey, compiler of the house chronicle. &AElig;thelwine is said to have been handsome, cheerful, and, though illiterate, endowed with every virtue. A brass effigy was placed on his tomb at the end of the thirteenth century. In addition to Ramsey, &AElig;thelwine was patron of satellite foundations at St Neots and Crowland. His three sons with his first wife, &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d (Leofwine, Eadwine, and &AElig;thelweard), were local thegns who did not achieve an eminence comparable to that of their father. &AElig;thelweard was killed at the battle of &#145;Assandun&#146; in 1016.<br>
