<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newall,  Hugh Frank</span>  (1857&#150;1944), <span class="occ">astrophysicist and educational benefactor</span>, was born at Ferndene, near Gateshead, on 21 June 1857, the youngest of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19974/', "Robert Stirling Newall (1812&#150;1889)")</script>, engineer, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Hugh Lee Pattinson FRS (1796&#150;1858), metallurgical chemist and astronomer. At the London Exhibition of 1862 R. S. Newall acquired two discs of crown and flint glass, which Thomas Cooke (1807&#150;1868) the following year contracted to figure and mount as a 25 inch refractor. The task took longer than anticipated, but the telescope was finally completed and mounted at Ferndene in 1871; this instrument shaped Hugh Newall's life and work.<br>
<br>After attending J. M. Furness's private school, Newall was educated at Rugby School (1872&#150;1876), then entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1876 as a pensioner. In 1880 he obtained a junior optime in the mathematical tripos, and a second class in the natural sciences tripos. At Rugby Newall fell in love with (Susannah) Margaret (1850&#150;1930), seven years his senior, daughter of his house master, the Revd Charles Arnold (<i>d</i>. 1878). Despite his parents' reservations, they married on 21 June 1881. An appointment in 1881 as assistant master at Wellington College was terminated in 1884 by Newall's poor health. He spent the next three years partly abroad and his first three papers, written in those years, indicate interests in natural phenomena; the last, written jointly with J. J. Thomson (1856&#150;1940), induced an invitation in 1886 to become his personal assistant and demonstrator in experimental physics at the Cavendish Laboratory, and in 1887 Newall became senior demonstrator, with special interest in laboratory spectroscopy.<br>
<br>In March 1889 Newall senior offered his refractor to Cambridge. For the impecunious university and observatory, the offer presented real problems, especially the recurring expense of staff. R. S. Newall died in April before the offer was accepted, and to implement his father's wish, Newall offered to work the &#145;Newall telescope&#146; from 1890 for five years without stipend, an offer renewed several times; he also contributed to its removal to a separate building on the observatory site. The Newalls built Madingley Rise, a fine house, next to the observatory; it became famed for gracious hospitality and as a cultural centre drawing astronomers, scientists, and music lovers of many nationalities.<br>
<br>Astrophysics was changing from small-scale sampling to quantitative collection of high-quality photographic observations. Great ingenuity was needed to adapt the telescope for photography and faint star spectroscopy. Newall designed a one-prism slit spectrograph, in 1895 began to study stellar spectra, and from 1896 pioneered in this country work on radial velocities. He then designed a four-prism spectrograph (1899). Those years of work and delicate observations yielded the independent discovery that Capella was a binary star (1899). Despite having only one assistant, paid by himself, Newall competed with H. C. Vogel at Potsdam and W. W. Campbell at Lick Observatory and proved &#145;that high-precision stellar spectroscopy was possible &hellip; in Britain&#146;  (Milne, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 456). In 1895 Newall deduced descending currents at the sun's surface near spots. He took part in six eclipse expeditions after 1898, and specialized in studying the solar corona. From 1906 he undertook a long study of sun-spot cycles to derive how the rotation of the sun differed from rigid body models. In 1916 he shared the identification of hydrocarbons in the solar spectrum, and in 1918 obtained the spectrum of Nova Aquilae.<br>
<br>Newall's researches introduced new fields of enquiry to the observatory and thereby established astrophysics at Cambridge. In 1892 he refused to direct the Cambridge observatory, thus maintaining his freedom to research. The new director and Lowndean professor was Robert S. Ball (1840&#150;1913), who did very little observing but divided his time between official duties, lecturing, mathematical researches, and popular lecturing and writing. Newall became assistant director in 1904; at that time he was unencumbered by university duties and, through his continued presence and successful astrophysical research, attracted several excellent students who won the Isaac Newton studentships, established in 1890 by Frank McClean (1837&#150;1904), and then sought research opportunities. Newall's scientific responsibilities soon increased. In 1904 a bequest from McClean &#145;to the Newall Observatory&#146;  (Stratton, 14) brought &pound;5000 for equipment, which Newall invested in solar apparatus. Crucially, however, he maintained his broader contribution to astrophysics by instigating and partly funding a new graduate post, an assistantship in astrophysics. These initiatives made Newall's observatory a natural beneficiary in 1908 of the Royal Society's donation of William Huggins's twin telescopes and spectroscopes. They were accommodated in the Astrophysical Building provided by Newall where they were re-mounted. Other gifts followed including E. H. Grove-Hills's valuable solar apparatus in 1909.<br>
<br>In 1882 J. Norman Lockyer (1836&#150;1920) became the controversial beneficiary of government funding for a new lectureship in physical astronomy at the Board of Education's new Normal School of Science at South Kensington. In 1887 he became professor, and director with a budget and staff for the separate Solar Physics Observatory (SPO) there. The government's annual grant to the observatory was its principal regular subsidy for solar research. In 1906 the board needed the site, and decided to relocate the SPO. Newall's work had established the potential of Cambridge as an alternative location and in mid-1909 the board stunned Lockyer by announcing negotiations with Cambridge, where Newall had already in January been elected a fellow of Trinity College, then to a new chair of astrophysics established for him (which he occupied without stipend until his retirement in 1928). The coincidence of Newall's academic rise and the board's announcement suggests intrigue. Joseph Larmor (1857&#150;1942), Lucasian professor of mathematics and a member of the board's committee, had manoeuvred the Cambridge interest: their friend Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory was building a great school of experimental physics, and spectroscopy was crucial; John Strutt, third Baron Rayleigh (1842&#150;1919), who had been Cavendish professor of experimental physics in 1879&#150;84, latterly with a special interest in physical optics, in 1908 became chancellor of the university; the ground was fertile. Newall was enabled to negotiate that the board make a sufficient capital grant for buildings, and transfer instruments and an enhanced SPO annual grant of &pound;3000 to Cambridge. When this was effected in 1913, merged with Newall's installations it became the separate and independently constituted Solar Physics Observatory, Cambridge; Newall directed it and had a staff of six. On his retirement in 1928 Newall endowed his chair, thereby consolidating astrophysics as an academic subject, especially since PhD degrees had meanwhile become available at Cambridge, in 1920.<br>
<br>Cambridge had not felt the need for a formal school of astronomy. The subjects were examined within the faculties of mathematics or physics, and especially since the early 1900s graduate students had a range of research opportunities under two directors at the observatory. In 1909 Newall founded the Observatory Club to promote interaction and access between all staff and students, and regular meetings became a tradition; in 1910 he published an elementary book on spectroscopy. Newall's initial generosity had made it possible to accept the &#145;Newall telescope&#146;. His successful research, and development of facilities often at his own expense, precipitated a major shift first of private and then of government resources which established astrophysics as an academic discipline at Cambridge, which university then dominated observational astrophysics in Britain until 1935.<br>
<br>Newall was elected FRS in 1902, and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1891; he served on its council continuously for forty-three years from 1893, as secretary from 1897 to 1901, and as president from 1907 to 1909. He was president of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1914&#150;16. Between 1883 and 1927 he published sixty-three papers, principally in the journals of those three societies and the <span class="italic">Astrophysical Journal</span>, of which he was on the editorial board. He was awarded an honorary degree of LLD by Durham. Newall was very active in the International Union for Cooperation in Solar Research, and in 1919 served on committees of the new International Astronomical Union of which in 1925 he was vice-president.<br>
<br>Newall was a natural philosopher of the old school, with no frontiers between his broad interests in science and art. He could afford not to press his many scientific projects to a conclusion; he loved the mysteries in science and nature, but disliked modern theories that explained them away. His colleague E. Arthur Milne emphasized that &#145;the coming of astrophysics to Cambridge &hellip; was almost entirely due to [Newall's] personal work and striking character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Obits. FRS</span>, 727). Mechanically skilful, an expert in optical design, he hated mechanical music, typewriters, or transport, and persisted with his brougham and pair. The Newalls gardened, farmed 50 acres, and travelled as widely as they read and entertained. Newall was profoundly influenced by his lifelong friendship with the American astrophysicist George Ellery Hale, who shared his wide interests.<br>
<br>Margaret Newall was a distinguished pianist who gave concerts in Cambridge, and accompanied and assisted her husband in his eclipse expeditions. After her death, childless, in 1930, Newall in June 1931 married their close friend Dame Bertha Surtees Phillpotts (1877&#150;1932), Scandinavian scholar and sometime mistress of Girton College, who was already seriously ill and died seven months later. Newall's career was much more significant than his published work. By his marked contributions to stellar and solar spectroscopy and then the institutional development of his observatory, and nurturing of graduate students, he earned his rank as &#145;one of the fathers of astrophysics in Great Britain&#146;  (Milne, <span class="italic">Nature</span>, 457). He died peacefully at Madingley Rise on 22 February 1944.<br>
