<span class="headword">Hewett, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1750&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 11 June 1750, the only son of Major Shuckburgh Hewett (1719&#150;1759), a descendant of an old Leicestershire family, and his wife, Ann Ward; both his parents died when he was young. He was sent to the grammar school at Wimborne, Dorset, and in 1761 was entered as a cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On 27 April 1762 he was given an ensigncy in the 70th foot, whose colonel, Cyrus Trapaud, had served with his father. On 20 April 1764 he was promoted lieutenant and joined his regiment in Grenada where he commanded a detachment and two howitzers. In 1771 he was sent to New York with invalids and to recruit, and was brigade major of the troops sent to St Vincent during the Carib uprising of 1772. Returning to England with his regiment in 1774, he obtained his company (the grenadiers) on 2 June 1775, and went with the corps to Halifax, Nova Scotia, whence he was detached with his company to Long Island. In 1780 he served as part of the 2nd battalion of grenadiers at the siege of Charles Town. His company afterwards embarked as marines on board Admiral Digby's flagship, in which Prince William, afterwards William IV, was serving as a midshipman. He obtained a majority by purchase in the 43rd foot on 1 December 1781 and, as deputy quartermaster-general, accompanied a brigade of reinforcements under General O'Hara to the West Indies. He returned to New York after Rodney's defeat of the French fleet at the battle of the Saints (12 April 1782) and commanded the 2nd battalion of grenadiers until invalided home. While convalescing in Bath he met and married, on 26 July 1785, Julia (1761&#150;1848), daughter of John Johnson of Blackheath; they had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In 1786, when the 43rd were stationed at Windsor, George III inspected them and Hewett received praise for their appearance. Through the king's intervention he became lieutenant-colonel of the 43rd in October 1787 and, in 1791, when commanding his regiment there, adjutant-general in Ireland, a post which he held until 1799. In 1794 he raised an Irish regiment, numbered the 92nd, which was drafted soon after. He became a major-general on 3 May 1796. He established a permanent commissariat staff in Ireland, and is credited with originating the idea of a brigade of instruction in light duties, the command of which was given to John Moore. In August 1799 he became both head of the recruiting department, with a district command at Chatham and Maidstone, and colonel-commandant of the 2nd battalion of the 5th foot. In 1801 the headquarters of the recruiting department were moved from Chatham to Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, and Hewett was appointed to command the island as part of the south-western district. He was transferred to the colonelcy of the 61st foot, on 4 April 1800. In 1803 he was made inspector-general of the royal army of reserve, and in November 1804 barrackmaster-general. In 1806 he was appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies, sailing on 17 April 1807 and landing in India on 17 October. In May 1809 he had to take over the government of India in Calcutta while the governor-general dealt with the mutiny among the company's officers in Madras. He set up commissariat departments in each presidency, encouraged the building of cantonments, and reorganized the staff of the Madras army. In 1810&#150;11 he organized the dispatch from India of the expeditions against Bourbon (R&eacute;union), the Isle of France (Mauritius), and Java. He left India on 18 December 1811 and reached Lymington, Hampshire, on 12 May 1812.<br>
<br>Hewett was promoted full general in June 1813, created a baronet on 6 November 1813, and the following month became commander of the forces in Ireland, being sworn of the Irish privy council on arrival. He left Ireland in 1816, and was created a GCB on 16 May 1820. In 1823 he purchased Freemantle Park, near Southampton, and settled there. He had expressed a particular desire to see the 61st, of which he had been colonel for forty years, on its return from Ceylon, but he died suddenly at his home on the day the regiment landed at Southampton, 21 March 1840. He was buried in Shirley church, near Southampton, and a monument was erected to him in the adjacent parish church of Millbrook. He was described as a tall, soldierly old man, much beloved in private life.<br>
