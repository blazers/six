<span class="headword">Cecil, Lord  (Edward Christian) David  Gascoyne-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>David Cecil]</span>  (1902&#150;1986), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 9 April 1902 at 24 Grafton Street, Mayfair, London, the fourth and last child and the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32338/', "James Edward Hubert Gascoyne-Cecil, fourth marquess of Salisbury (1861&#150;1947)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Lady (Cicely) Alice Gore (1867&#150;1955), second daughter of the fifth earl of Arran, descended on her mother's side from the Melbourne family. A delicate child, he was much at home and benefited in this from the company of his brilliant aunts and uncles, notorious for their eccentricities, wit, and zeal. Between 1915 and 1919 he was at Eton College, where the confidence fostered by this remarkable family carried him through an unfamiliar and in some ways uncongenial atmosphere. His experience of Oxford&#151;he matriculated from Christ Church in 1920&#151;was different. He loved the life and the place. His exceptionally quick, associative mind served him well in his final examinations where he took a first class in modern history (1924). Though he failed to win an All Souls fellowship, he was elected to a fellowship at Wadham in 1924 to teach mainly history. At the same time, with characteristic independence, he was writing a life of the poet William Cowper, <span class="italic">The Stricken Deer</span>, his first and one of his best books, which was published in 1929 and won the Hawthornden prize in 1930.<br>
<br>This success led to Cecil's decision to resign his fellowship in 1930 and take up the life of a writer in London. There he met and fell in love with Rachael Mary Veronica (Rachel) MacCarthy (1909&#150;1982), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34679/', "Desmond MacCarthy")</script>, literary critic, one of the original members of the Bloomsbury group. Their marriage took place on 13 October 1932. Virginia Woolf in a wry but affectionate entry in her diary describes &#145;David and Rachel, arm-in-arm, sleep-walking down the aisle, preceded by a cross which ushered them into a car and so into a happy, long life, I make no doubt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Virginia Woolf</span>, ed. A. O. Bell, 4, 1982, 128). She was not to know how accurate her ironic prediction would prove. A remarkable woman in her own right, Rachel MacCarthy was the perfect match for her husband. Of a simpler, more practical nature, she shared his vivacity and his unfailing curiosity about people, literature, and life. Like him, she was instinctively religious and a practising Christian. They were perfectly happy together, drawing their many friends into that happiness, for fifty years. They had two sons, <a href="#cosubject_104110">Jonathan [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Hugh (<i>b</i>. 1941), and a daughter, Laura (<i>b</i>. 1947).<br>
<br>As he now moved into the country near Cranborne, Dorset, David Cecil's new life, though congenial, showed him that he missed Oxford, especially the teaching. In 1939 he accepted a fellowship in English at New College and it was here as tutor and, from 1949, as Goldsmiths' professor that he exercised his widest influence and produced much of his best work. He had a genius for teaching, communicating enjoyment, and drawing out the best from others. A brilliant conversationalist, his wit consisted in verbal sharpness and accuracy, together with a peculiarly sympathetic humour that was always adapted to the company and the occasion; he was a member of the literary discussion group the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92544', "Inklings")</script>. Cecil was a celebrated lecturer, but his influence was most felt in tutorials, classes, or small, intimate groups. He and his wife, naturally hospitable, were eager to mix their friends and share them with young unknowns. Without condescension or pretension they spread over a wide circle of acquaintances and pupils the best-known cultural, political, and artistic influences of the mid-twentieth century.<br>
<br>In the 1960s Cecil began to feel that his particular concern for English literature was under attack in an increasingly professional age. He never avoided, indeed enjoyed, debate, and was confident of his position, but he shared his family's clear-sightedness about the signs of the times. Developments in graduate studies, and the insistence on advanced degrees as a qualification for university teaching, made him feel his way was out of favour. In 1969 he reached retirement age and went happily to Cranborne, where he continued to write and entertain until his wife's death in 1982, and, though less happily, with remarkable resilience and little diminished powers of enjoyment until his own death.<br>
<br>Cecil's writings, especially his biographies of William Cowper, Lord Melbourne (1955), Jane Austen (1978), and Charles Lamb (1983), are a substantial contribution to the understanding of different kinds of personality and period. As such they had a value beyond the academic, and reached a wide readership. His literary criticism came to be seriously underestimated. <span class="italic">Early Victorian Novelists</span> (1934) was ahead of its time in a subtle analysis and discussion of the structure of <span class="italic">Wuthering Heights</span>. <span class="italic">Hardy the Novelist</span> (1943) remains a classic exposition of the work of one of his favourite authors. His best essays, too often written off as <i>belles-lettres</i>, are as acute as they are sensitive. But most typical of his imagination is his response to extrovert, worldly figures like Melbourne, or balanced moral observers such as Jane Austen, and, on the other hand, to introverted, despondent, but gentle and humorous spirits, such as Cowper and Lamb. To their situation he was drawn by a sympathy typical of the depth and complexity of his own nature.<br>
<br>Cecil considered himself, with good reason, the most fortunate of men. Born into one of the first families in the land, gifted with intellectual and imaginative sympathies of a high order, professionally successful, idyllically happy in his marriage and family life, he might well have grown complacent and a figure of envy. But complacency was not in his nature or his background: he was self-critical and self-aware. As for enemies, he had few if any. He was greatly loved because of the unusual sweetness of his temper and his genuine humility. Naturally high-spirited and with some vanity, he felt most strongly an inherited impulse of service and purpose. Himself a devout Christian, what he possessed he wanted to share, and he had been given precisely the gifts to enable this. His appearance was extraordinary and memorable: elegant and at the same time spontaneously gauche, continually in motion from the twirling thumbs to the enthusiastic forward lurch. His voice, too, was rapid, stuttering, and spasmodic, with Edwardian pronunciation. David Cecil was one of the most influential cultural figures of his age.<br>
<br>Cecil was appointed CH in 1949 and CLit in 1972. He had honorary doctorates from London, Leeds, Liverpool, St Andrews, and Glasgow universities. He was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1937 to 1951. He died at his home, Red Lion House, Salisbury Street, Cranborne, Dorset, on 1 January 1986.<br>
<br>Cecil's elder son, <a name="cosubject_104110"></a><span class="headword">Jonathan Hugh  Gascoyne-Cecil</span>  (1939&#150;2011), <span class="occ">actor</span>, known as Jonathan Cecil, was born on 22 February 1939 at 21 Arlington Street, St James's, London, and educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford, where he read modern languages, became a close friend of Dennis Potter, and appeared in cabaret with Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett. After graduating in 1961 he went to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, followed by work in repertory theatre in Northampton, Dundee, and Salisbury. On 27 July 1963 he married Vivien Sarah Frances Heilbron (<i>b</i>. 1944), actress, and daughter of David Granville Heilbron, company chairman. He made both his film d&eacute;but and his television d&eacute;but in 1964 and first appeared in the West End the following year. He went on also to build a substantial career on radio and as a narrator on audio recordings (most notably of the works of P. G. Wodehouse). Although he appeared in Shakespeare and Chekhov, and was highly regarded by his peers for his &#145;straight&#146; acting, it was in comic roles that he excelled, most frequently as a dim-witted or eccentric upper-class &#145;toff&#146;, a role he made peculiarly his own and in which he was much in demand. Greatly interested in the history of the theatre and music hall, he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Call Boy</span>, the journal of the British Music Hall Society, and for many years was a book reviewer for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. A colourful character, often seen in an immaculate Jermyn Street suit set off by a raffish fedora, he was a bon viveur and a brilliant raconteur, and spent much time at the Garrick Club. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 3 November 1976 he married the actress and singer Anna Sharkey (<i>b</i>. 1937), whom he had met when both were in the cast of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Cowardy Custard</span> at the Mermaid Theatre in 1972. Living latterly in Ravenscourt Gardens, Hammersmith, he died at the Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, on 22 September 2011, of bronchopneumonia and oesophageal cancer. His wife, Anna Sharkey, survived him.<br>
