<span class="headword">Dale,  Harold Edward</span>  (1875&#150;1954), <span class="occ">civil servant and author</span>, was born at 24 Shadwell Road, Islington, London, on 5 December 1875, the son of Henry James Dale, a &#145;manufacturing electrician&#146;, and his wife, Caroline Harrison. After attending St Paul's School he went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1894, following his elder brother Frank Harry Busbridge Dale (1871&#150;1918) who became chief inspector of elementary schools. At Balliol he gained firsts in both classical moderations (1896) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1898), and won several prestigious university prizes. In 1898 he was elected to a fellowship at New College which continued until 1905. Meanwhile he had also come first in the civil service examination and in 1898 joined the Colonial Office. As a Colonial Office official he undertook varied assignments&#151;a mission to British Honduras in 1903&#150;4, one of the British representatives at the Anglo-French conference on the New Hebrides in 1906, assistant secretary to the Imperial Conference of 1909, and Colonial Office representative at the north Atlantic fishing arbitration at The Hague in 1910. On 4 March 1911 Dale married Isabel Woodrow, (1885/6&#150;1950), daughter of Samuel George Warner, actuary, at Balham Congregational Church.<br>
<br>A change of direction came in 1910 when Dale became secretary to the Development Commission, a body set up in 1909 to encourage rural development, including agricultural research and advisory services. This appointment meant that he eventually transferred to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, where he became in 1917 an acting assistant secretary. In 1919 he received a permanent appointment and was made CB. After moving to agriculture Dale undertook tasks which again took him abroad, in 1920 to Fiji to initiate a reorganization of the civil service in that area, and in 1923&#150;4 to Jamaica as financial commissioner. In 1927 he was promoted to principal assistant secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, from which he retired in 1935. A few years later he left London to live in Blewbury, Berkshire. Shortly before the death in 1950 of his wife he moved to Oxford, living at Norham End, Norham Gardens. He died, at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 30 July 1954.<br>
<br>Dale was a man of outstanding intellectual ability and highly regarded in the civil service. That he did not reach the highest levels may in part have been due both to his lifelong dedication to varied scholarly interests and to his natural shyness. He regularly published reviews and articles on classical subjects, and only a year before he died a fourth edition of Jowett's translation of the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> of Plato came out, jointly edited by Dale and D. J. Allan, a fellow of Balliol. Dale also wrote on agricultural topics, but is best remembered for what he wrote on the civil service after retirement. <span class="italic">The Higher Civil Service of Great Britain</span> was written as the Second World War approached and published by Oxford University Press in 1941. It contains a detailed and well-informed account of the small group to which he had belonged, and which in those days occupied a predominant position in the immediate support of ministers in the formulation of policy, the preparation of legislation, and the general administration of the country. His calm and thorough treatment of his subject is enlivened by shrewd judgements on men and affairs, and by a certain dry wit sharpened by his own official experiences. The text is generously adorned with quotations in Latin and Greek, with no translations offered.<br>
<br>In 1943 Dale gave the Sidney Ball lecture in Oxford, published in the same year as a Barnett House paper under the title <span class="italic">The Personnel and Problems of the Higher Civil Service</span>. Essentially this offers a summary of some features of the earlier book. He also contributed a chapter on parliament and the civil service to a book entitled <span class="italic">Parliament: a Survey</span>, published in 1952. His work stands at the beginning of a lively tradition of descriptive and critical writing about the civil service and its place in the British parliamentary system. He provided a model for subsequent academic scholars and for one or two from the service itself, notably C. H. Sisson. But within two decades of his death the scholar&#150;administrator so impressively exemplified by Dale had become virtually extinct.<br>
