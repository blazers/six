<span class="headword">Hahn,  Emily <span class="st"> [Mickey]</span></span>  (1905&#150;1997), <span class="occ">author and traveller</span>, was born at 4858 Fountain Avenue, St Louis, Missouri, on 14 January 1905, the fifth of the six children of Isaac Newton Hahn (1856&#150;1934), hardware salesman, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schoen (1866&#150;1957). Her parents, who were of German-Jewish heritage and liberal inclinations, encouraged their children to think for themselves; young Mickey (as she was known to family and friends) took their advice to heart. A precocious child, she taught herself to read at the age of three and soon thereafter began charting her own course in life. Having received a bachelor of science degree at the University of Wisconsin (1922&#150;6), where she was the first woman to graduate from the school's mining engineering programme, Hahn took a job as a petroleum geologist. However, inspired by the derring-do of the pioneer aviator Charles Lindberg, she abruptly left her job in May 1927, vowing never again to lead a &#145;conventional&#146; life. Following a six-month stint as a horseback trail guide in the New Mexico wilderness, she enrolled in graduate studies in geology at Columbia University in New York City and began writing freelance articles for various publications, one of which was the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> magazine.<br>
<br>Despite her early journalistic successes in America, in December 1929 Hahn moved to London, where she developed a wide and varied circle of friends that included the choreographer Frederick Ashton and writer Rebecca West. Boosted by the publication in New York of her first book, <span class="italic">Seductio ad Absurdum: the Principles and Practices of Seduction</span> (1930), and by West's mentorship, Hahn's literary career began to blossom. None the less, on Christmas day 1930 she went off in search of adventure in the Belgian Congo, spending the next twenty months living and working at a remote Croix Rouge du Congo medical aid mission. By the time she had hiked solo across east Africa and returned to London in January 1933 she was &#145;broke and practically without any wardrobe&#146;  (Cuthbertson, 118). During the next two years she wrote two books about her African adventures, endured an ill-fated love affair with a married Hollywood screenwriter, and did graduate-level studies in anthropology at Oxford University.<br>
<br>Ever restless, in March 1935 Hahn and an older sister sailed for Japan and China on a three-month sightseeing trip that would grow into an eight-year adventure. Seduced by the romance and mystery of Shanghai, she found work as a teacher and journalist and lived the high life as the girlfriend of Sir Victor Sassoon, a British businessman of Jewish background who was reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in the British empire at the time. Hahn further scandalized the European and American communities by smoking opium, keeping a mischievous pet gibbon that she took to social engagements, and socializing with the locals. Her flat became a gathering spot for an eclectic group of Chinese political activists, bon vivants, intellectuals, students, and artists, including the future premier of communist China Zhou Enlai, and a dashing and well-to-do poet and publisher named Sinmay Zau, who took Hahn as his concubine. After Zau had introduced her to the Soong sisters, the most influential women in China, Hahn wrote <span class="italic">The Soong Sisters</span> (1941), the book that became her first international bestseller.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1940, with China in turmoil and battling against an invading Japanese army as the world slid inexorably toward global war, Hahn departed for America. <i>En route</i> she stopped in Hong Kong, and there fell into a torrid love affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74008/', "Charles Ralph Boxer (1904&#150;2000)")</script>, the married chief of British army intelligence. A frustrated historian and author, he was bored with life and had adopted a live-for-the-moment attitude. On 17 October 1941 Hahn gave birth to Boxer's daughter, Carola. Hahn was still in Hong Kong when on 25 December 1941 the Japanese occupied the crown colony. Hahn managed to avoid detention and for the next twenty months she helped to feed and care for Boxer, who was a prisoner of war after being seriously wounded in action. However, by September 1943 conditions were growing increasingly dangerous in Hong Kong, and so Hahn returned to the United States in a Red Cross prisoner exchange. She spent the rest of the war in New York, winning success with her writing&#151;particularly <span class="italic">China to Me</span> (1944), a sensational bestseller that recounted her recent adventures in the Far East&#151;but distraught by rumours that the Japanese had executed Boxer.<br>
<br>Liberated on VJ-day, Boxer travelled to New York. After his divorce was finalized he and Hahn were married there on 28 November 1945 and took up residence on the Boxer family's estate near Weymouth, Dorset. Having retired from the army in 1947, Boxer accepted a teaching position at King's College, London. Meanwhile his wife was busy caring for the couple's second child, Amanda, working as a freelance broadcaster at the BBC, and writing under her maiden name. Among the books she wrote during this period was <span class="italic">England to Me</span> (1949), a provocatively irreverent account of English family life in the difficult post-war years.<br>
<br>Predictably, however, Hahn proved ill suited for English country life or for conventional domesticity. Thus in early 1950 the Boxers agreed to make theirs an &#145;open marriage&#146;&#151;not in the sexual sense, but rather in terms of domicile and lifestyle. Boxer and his younger daughter Amanda (later a well-known stage and screen actress in the UK) kept the home fires burning, while Hahn returned (with Carola) to New York and a job as a staff writer at the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>. For the next forty-seven years, she and Carola spent much of the year in New York, regularly sojourning in the UK for stays of no longer than ninety-one days, the number that established residence for income-tax purposes. Professionally these arrangements proved productive for both partners. Boxer's academic career flourished, while Hahn achieved considerable literary success and in the 1970s was lionized as an early champion of feminism (a label she rejected).<br>
<br>Hahn died on 18 February 1997 at St Vincent's Hospital, New York, of heart failure following a fall and was cremated the same day. By the time of her death she had written hundreds of articles (including a whimsical <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> essay of 1966 entitled &#145;Aisle K&#146;, in which she chronicled her lifelong love affair with the British Museum reading room), short stories, poems, and fifty-two books on a wide range of topics. Among her best-known later works were <span class="italic">Meet the British</span> (1953), which she co-wrote with Charles Roetter and Harford Thomas, <span class="italic">Chiang Kai-shek: an Unauthorized Biography</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Animal Gardens</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Times and Places</span> (1970), a collection of autobiographical articles, and <span class="italic">Eve and the Apes</span> (1988). News of Hahn's death was prominently reported in the London <span class="italic">Times</span>, the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, and other publications, and even in China, where she was officially <i>persona non grata</i> because of her association with Madame Chiang Kai-shek. An Emily Hahn obituary in the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> magazine, which hailed her as &#145;Ms Ulysses&#146;, noted that a &#145;lifetime of reporting and vivid adventure kept her happily out of touch with convention&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Yorker</span>, 10 March 1997). The summation was indeed an apt one.<br>
