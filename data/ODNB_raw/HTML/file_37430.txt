<span class="headword">Frampton,  (George Vernon) Meredith</span>  (1894&#150;1984), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in St John's Wood, London, on 17 March 1894, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33242/', "Sir George Frampton (1860&#150;1928)")</script>, one of the leading sculptors of his day, and his wife, Christabel Annie Cockerell (1863&#150;1951), a painter. He was educated at Westminster School, London, and attended St John's Wood Art School and then (1912&#150;15) the Royal Academy Schools. During the First World War he worked on the western front in a field survey company and in interpretation of aerial photographs. He was one of the most accomplished of the many inter-war European painters who represented the observed world with pronounced clarity. From 1920 to 1945 he showed in the Royal Academy summer exhibition in all but four years, being elected ARA in 1934 and RA in 1942.<br>
<br>The majority of Frampton's paintings are portraits (many of them commissions, both private and institutional). His sitters, who included the duke of York, later George VI, in 1929, were active in imaginative and intellectual pursuits&#151;art, architecture, music, theatre, literature, science, and public service. He specially admired the French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741&#150;1828) for the directness with which he conveyed a sitter's presence and personality without obtruding himself between subject and viewer. Unusually for his generation, Frampton was an heir to this tradition. Early portraits employed austere backgrounds, but he increasingly revealed unusual skill in realizing the appearance of three-dimensional objects with almost <i>trompe-l'&#339;il</i> verisimilitude, as well as a keen sense of the texture and even the feel of any depicted substance. Carefully chosen attributes both explained a sitter's work and interests and provided a satisfying interplay of forms, within which shapes were made to rhyme in curious and subtle ways. Like his pure essays in the genre, these images proved Frampton a master of still life, with a relish for the particular which embraced test-tubes, matchboxes, skulls, autograph scores, and even a can of weed-killer. For all his love of tradition, both the enigmatic stillness of his paintings of commonplace objects and his interest in purity of form in an abstract sense were peculiarly expressive of the modern era.<br>
<br>In 1951 Frampton married Hilda Norman, daughter of the architect James Bow Dunn. They had no children. In 1953 he was placed at his own request on the Royal Academy's retired list. Perfectionist in all things, he declined to continue painting once a slight deterioration in eyesight precluded the extreme clarity he sought. But his retirement was into anything but inactivity. A member for sixty-nine years of the Art-Workers' Guild, he had inherited from his father a strong feeling for materials and a commitment to meticulous workmanship. He retired to the striking hilltop house (in Monkton Deverill, Wiltshire) he had designed in the 1930s, its style reminiscent of the architecture of seventeenth-century France. Here he created (and from his studio-cum-workshop maintained for forty years) an interior remarkable for its beauty and its well-thought-out detail, from the mechanism of clocks to the ingenious adaptation of items of furniture.<br>
<br>After 1945 Frampton's dignified, thoroughly realized art virtually disappeared from public consciousness for thirty years. He was eighty-eight when in 1982 he held his first one-man exhibition, a retrospective at the Tate Gallery, London. To his surprise and delight, members of a younger generation found inspiration in his work and he was able to die knowing that his art would not be forgotten. Prudent and orderly, uncompromising in his views on life and art, and instinctively reserved in a post-war world which contradicted them extensively, he was a man of humour, courtesy, and charm who unbent when he sensed that his deep feeling for beauty, order, and sound technique was shared. Shortly after moving to Mount Pleasant, Castle Hill Lane, Mere, Wiltshire, he died there on 16 September 1984.<br>
