<span class="headword">Runting,  Ernest George Virgo</span>  (1861&#150;1954), <span class="occ">chiropodist</span>, was born on 26 December 1861, at 68 South Audley Street, London, the son of William Runting (<i>d</i>. 1881), dentist, and his wife, Fanny Maria Potter (1832&#150;1882), chiropodist, who followed her parents in the craft. Educated privately, Runting at fifteen was apprenticed as a cadet to a three-master ship, the <i>Suffolk</i>, and he served for five years, making many trips to North America. On the death of his father in 1881 his mother bought him out of the service and trained him and his brother William in chiropody.<br>
<br>In 1884 Runting started his own practice in Elm Park Terrace, South Kensington, London. He built a large connection and followed his mother, who was chiropodist to Queen Victoria, with royal appointments to Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary. From earning fee receipts of &pound;64 10<i>s</i>. in 1884 he went on to average &pound;2000 per annum from 1897 to 1927, having the leading practice in the country, but treating the needy free.<br>
<br>Runting's ambition was to make the craft of chiropody a profession, and he had contact with developments in America from 1895, when chiropodists were first licensed in New York. A patient, the Revd Dr Arnold Whittaker Oxford (1855&#150;1948), was impressed by Runting and suggested in 1912 that they should form a society of chiropodists. Oxford had been the high-church vicar of St Luke's, Beswick Street, for sixteen years, but becoming uncertain of his ecclesiastical position had trained in medicine. A wealthy man, Oxford found medicine the medium for his humanitarian activities. In addition to being a Greek scholar, an author of books on antiquarian subjects, an untiring worker in the hospital and charitable fields, and a leading freemason, he was so impressed by Runting's skills as a chiropodist that he was determined that such benefits be brought within the reach of everyone. A meeting was called of thirty-five chiropodists (the leading practitioners from England and Scotland) and held at Runting's home and place of practice, 7 New Burlington Street, London, on 14 November 1912, when the decision was taken to form the National Society of Chiropodists, with Runting as president and Oxford as honorary treasurer.<br>
<br>In 1913 the society opened the Silver Street Pedic Clinic (later the London Foot Hospital), near the British Museum, for the free treatment of the necessitous poor. A journal, <span class="italic">The Chiropodist</span>, was started in January 1914; a library was begun, and lectures and clinical training were established. A school of chiropody was due to open in 1914 (Oxford had persuaded several medical practitioners to help), but the outbreak of war prevented it. During the war servicemen were treated free at the clinic, and short courses were provided for soldiers sent by the War Office who then served as battalion chiropodists. The school was eventually opened at the clinic in April 1919, and Runting headed the staff (all giving their services free) and was active in developing the academic course and clinical teaching. Runting and Oxford are regarded as the founders of the London Foot Hospital School of Podiatric Medicine. Runting had contributed a chapter to the first multi-authored work of its kind, <span class="italic">Textbook of Chiropody</span> (1914); and the first of his own books, <span class="italic">Battalion Chiropody Training and Practice</span>, was published in 1918.<br>
<br>Runting's classic <span class="italic">Practical Chiropody</span> was published in 1925 and received good reviews from the <span class="italic">Medical Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. The book reached its eighth edition in 1952, and there were seven reprints; a revised, ninth edition was published in 1956, after Runting's death, and there were several American editions as well as one in Spanish. <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> had printed an article by Runting on the treatment of corns in 1927, and in many of his other writings Runting built on the work of Lewis Durlacher (1792&#150;1864), developing the use of silver nitrate, the treatment of verrucae, toenail problems, the rational approach to the treatment of corns, and the importance of considering &#145;the chiropodist's handicap&#151;the shoe&#146;. From its beginnings in 1914 <span class="italic">The Chiropodist</span> had a monthly page of jottings by Runting, under the pen-name Old Chiro, which continued until 1945 and did much to influence the development of the profession. A selection appeared as <span class="italic">Chiropody Jottings</span> in 1932.<br>
<br>Runting and his wife, Mabel (1851/2&#150;1932), had a son and two daughters (one in practice with him). Runting devoted his life to chiropody, and, generous of his time and money to needy patients, his colleagues, and his church, he died a poor man. He was a member of All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, for many years, and was elected people's warden of St Peter's in 1946. Runting died as a result of acute bronchitis at his home, 155 Chiltern Court, Baker Street, London, on 16 January 1954. A thanksgiving service was held at All Souls on 22 January.<br>
