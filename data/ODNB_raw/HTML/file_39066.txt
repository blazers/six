<span class="headword">Montgomery,  James</span>  (1794&#150;1880), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer and author</span>, was born on 2 December 1794 at the cotton mill village of Blantyre on the Clyde in Lanarkshire, son of William Montgomery, employed in Taylor's cotton mill, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reid. Little is known of Montgomery's early life. Raised in the first generation of Scottish children to be inducted into the machine-dominated discipline of the cotton factory, he not only learned to read and write, but also acquired a thorough knowledge of cotton spinning, weaving, and finishing. By the mid-1830s he was working as a cotton mill manager for MacLeroy, Hamilton &amp; Co. of Calton, Glasgow, where the Scottish cotton industry flourished before fading in the railway age.<br>
<br>Montgomery came to public notice in 1832 with the publication of his <span class="italic">The Carding and Spinning Master's Assistant, or, The Theory and Practice of Cotton Spinning</span>. This was an invaluable practical handbook&#151;the first of its kind. Compiled from notes made for Montgomery's own use as a mill manager, it presented rules, illustrated with worked examples, for calculating speeds, drafts, and settings for cylinders, rollers, and spindles, and ways of adjusting them to suit various cotton qualities, or to produce yarns differing in fineness, a knowledge jealously guarded by the first generation of mill overseers and managers. A second edition appeared in 1833 and a third in 1836, which was enlarged and retitled <span class="italic">The Theory and Practice of Cotton Spinning, or, The Carding and Spinning Master's Assistant</span>, all from the same publisher, John Nixon of Glasgow. In addition Montgomery prepared a small pocket manual of rules, calculations, and worked examples for use by mill overseers. Entitled <span class="italic">The Cotton Spinner's Manual, or, A Compendium of the Principles of Cotton Spinning</span> and issued by his publisher in 1835, and again in 1850, it was similar to George Galbraith's <span class="italic">The Cotton Spinner's Companion</span>, published in Glasgow in 1834.<br>
<br>Through his publications, Montgomery's reputation spread abroad. When, in 1835, Daniel Treadwell, inventor, entrepreneur, and Rumford Professor at Harvard University, visited Britain, he was commissioned <i>inter alia</i> to secure economic and technical information. Finding Glasgow manufacturers far more open than those in Manchester, Treadwell gleaned what he could from Montgomery and relayed his information to one of his sponsors, Samuel Batchelder (1784&#150;1879), a prominent New England cotton manufacturer. This led Batchelder to invite Montgomery to become superintendent of the York Manufacturing Company at Saco in Maine, USA. In 1836, or soon after, Montgomery emigrated with his family, which, by the time of the US census of 1840, comprised two males beside himself and six females.<br>
<br>Whereas in Glasgow Montgomery had managed a factory with 11,000 spindles and 200 power-looms, all steam-driven, in Maine he had charge of three (later four) factories of 3000&#150;6000 spindles each, and a total of several hundred water-powered looms. While at Saco, Montgomery wrote his most important book, <span class="italic">A Practical Detail of the Cotton Manufacture of the United States of America, and the State of the Cotton Manufacture of that Country Contrasted and Compared with that of Great Britain</span>, which was published in Glasgow in 1840. It responded to British worries about American competition in overseas textile markets, and the debate over relative cotton manufacturing costs in Britain and the USA. The volume gave precise estimates, unmatched elsewhere and derived from first-hand experience in both countries. Montgomery concluded that overall American running costs were 3 per cent less than British ones. When he came to revise the volume he brought the differential of American advantage down to 1 per cent. Both figures were much lower than British commentators had earlier alleged. One unexpected result of the publication of his <span class="italic">Practical Detail</span> was a vigorous, and at times slanderous, debate in the Boston newspapers about the relative costs of steam power and water power in manufacturing cotton. Montgomery was accused of underestimating the cost of water power as compared with steam power. His opponent Justitia, who gave his pseudonym to the debate, has been identified as Charles Tillinghast James (1805&#150;1862), a mill engineer from Rhode Island.<br>
<br>Montgomery left Maine in 1843, and worked in New York state until 1850. He then joined the sporadic migration of workers from New England to the south and became superintendent and treasurer of the Graniteville Manufacturing Company's factory in South Carolina. Sponsored by William Gregg (1800&#150;1867), the well-known promoter of southern manufacturing, the mill started in 1849, when it ran 10,000 spindles and 300 power-looms, driven by water turbines. Montgomery stayed there until 1863. In 1867 he was superintendent of the Batesville Manufacturing Company in the South Carolina piedmont. Montgomery retained strong Presbyterian convictions, but was recalled as tolerant of others. His wife, whose identity is unknown, died in 1876. Montgomery died at Pliny, Greenville county, South Carolina, on 27 December 1880.<br>
