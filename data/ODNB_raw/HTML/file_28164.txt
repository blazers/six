<span class="headword">Vaux,  Nicholas</span>, first Baron Vaux  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1523), <span class="occ">courtier and soldier</span>, was of an old Northamptonshire family. The Vaux estate of Harrowden had been acquired through the marriage of Margaret Vaux, Nicholas's great-aunt, to William Harrowden early in the fifteenth century. Nicholas's father, <a name="cosubject_28164"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Vaux</span>  (1437&#150;1471)<span class="occ"></span>, married before 22 December 1456 Katharine Peniston (<i>d</i>. in or after 1509) of Provence, probably a lady-in-waiting to Margaret of Anjou. William Vaux, who was knighted about 1460, was attainted in November 1461 by Edward IV's first parliament, and he was next noted by Fortescue among the exiles in St Mighel with Queen Margaret in a letter of 13 December 1464. Vaux returned to England, probably with the queen in 1471, as he died on the field of Tewkesbury on 4 May and was buried in Tewkesbury Abbey. Katharine Vaux was among the ladies taken after the battle with Queen Margaret, and was said to have returned to France with the queen in January 1476. In February 1478 Edward IV granted Katharine life interest in the manors of Stanton and Markham, which she had held with Vaux, because she &#145;hath none erthly thing for her and her children to lyve upon&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C81/863/4673). Those children were Nicholas and his sister Jane, or Joan, who married Sir Richard Guildford, perhaps by November 1487, as a Dame Joana Guildford is listed among the ladies attending Elizabeth of York's coronation.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandlocalservice"></a>Early life and local service</h2>Nicholas Vaux's childhood is obscure; he may have lived in the household of Margaret, countess of Richmond, given the comment in a pedigree that he &#145;floruit summa gratia apud Margaretam comitissam Richmundiae&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Certainly Vaux rapidly found favour under Henry VII. In Henry's first parliament Vaux petitioned for, and was granted, reversal of his father's attainder and the return of his lands; and on 2 November 1485, as an esquire of the body, he gained the stewardships of Olney and Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire. Throughout his life he performed his share of local service in his home county of Northamptonshire, through regular inclusion in commissions of the peace and for matters ranging from gaol delivery to sewers, and he was sheriff of Northamptonshire for the years commencing 5 November 1495, 5 November 1501, and 10 November 1516. Further fruits of royal favour included a grant on 1 June 1502 of the constableship of Rockingham Castle and stewardship of the lordships of Rockingham, Brigstock, and King's Cliffe with various associated offices.<br>
<br>Some time early in Henry's VII's reign Vaux married Elizabeth, daughter of Lord Fitzhugh and widow of Sir William Parr. They had three daughters: Katharine, who married Sir George Throckmorton; Ann, who married Thomas, Lord Strange; and Alice, who married Sir Richard Sapcote. After Elizabeth's death (before July 1507), Vaux made an advantageous second marriage before February 1508 with Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1489, <i>d</i>. in or before 1523), daughter of Sir Thomas Green, who inherited lands in York, Kent, Nottinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Leicestershire, and Lincolnshire on her father's death in December 1506. Vaux paid heavily for the marriage. His children with Anne were: Margaret, who married Sir Francis Poulteney; Bridget, who married Maurice Welsh; Maud, who married Sir John Fermor; and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28163/', "Thomas Vaux")</script>, who married Vaux's ward Elizabeth Cheyne, and William.<h2>
<a name="Diplomaticandmilitaryservice"></a>Diplomatic and military service</h2>Anstruther described Vaux as a jouster, courtier, and soldier, and his courtly and military talents were particularly exercised in French affairs. He was knighted on 16 June 1487 at Stoke, and made banneret in June 1497 after Blackheath, but though nominated several times for the Order of the Garter he was never chosen. On 23 December 1488 Vaux was among those commissioned in Northamptonshire to muster archers for the king's expedition to Brittany. He was with the knights who met the French delegates in 1492 during the settlement of the treaty of &Eacute;taples. In 1500 he accompanied Henry VII to Calais for his meeting with the archduke. An indenture dated 1 June 1502 appointed Vaux lieutenant of Gu&icirc;nes, and Henry VIII renewed Vaux's indenture at Gu&icirc;nes as &#145;keeper, governor, surveyor and lieutenant&#146; for twenty years from 6 October 1509. Vaux's tenure in France was graced by triumphs and trials. He was called to serve in the vanguard of the king's army with 300 men under Lord Lisle in the campaign that captured Th&eacute;rouanne and Tournai in April 1513; he fought at the battle of the spurs, but was forced to flee for his life from the ambush of a supply train travelling from Calais to the army at Th&eacute;rouanne about 27&#150;9 June. When policy turned to alliance, Vaux and his wife were summoned on 4 September 1514 to join the escort of Henry VIII's sister Mary to Abbeville for her marriage to Louis XII, and Vaux attended the marriage ceremony on 9 October.<br>
<br>From 1518 to 1520 Vaux was at the centre of Anglo-French affairs. On 9 November 1518 he was commissioned along with the earl of Worcester, the bishop of Ely, and Thomas Docwra to receive Fran&ccedil;ois I's oath accepting the treaty of London, which established peace and a marriage agreement between Henry VIII's daughter Mary and the dauphin Fran&ccedil;ois, and surrendered Tournai to the French on payment of 50,000 francs. Vaux was received by Fran&ccedil;ois with the other ambassadors on 12 December and was present at Notre Dame in Paris two days later when Fran&ccedil;ois gave his oath. On 30 January 1519 he was in Tournai with Worcester, Docwra, and Sir Edward Belknap, and on 10 February the town was surrendered. Vaux's next task was to prepare for the Field of Cloth of Gold; he served on the commission to appoint the time and place of the meeting. In January 1520 Fran&ccedil;ois I asked for Vaux to assist the earl of Worcester in choosing a place for the meeting, in lieu of the sieur de Chastillon. On 17 March Vaux, Belknap, and Sir William Sandys &#145;landyed at Caleys&#146; charged with &#145;the makynge of a palace before the castle gate of Gwines&#146; and making other necessary arrangements for lodgings, feasting, jousting, and fortifications  (J. G. Nichols, ed., <span class="italic">A Chronicle of Calais in the Reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII to the Year 1540</span>, CS, 35, 1845, 18). Vaux appears to have had a major role in supervising the building and had no easy time of it, judging by his letters to Wolsey of March, April, and May 1520, complaining of dilatory provisioners and lack of money. He was summoned as a knight of Northamptonshire to be present with Henry at the meeting. On 7 June 1520, the day the festivities commenced, he and the other English ambassadors had audience with Fran&ccedil;ois I.<br>
<br>Vaux's life was not without controversy. Treason was hinted against him in a letter of September 1504 or 1505 in which Sir Hugh Conway, then treasurer of Calais, claimed that Vaux and Antony Browne, lieutenant of Calais, had indicated that if the Tudor dynasty were challenged they &#145;should make ther peaxce hoo ever the worlde tourne&#146;  (Gairdner, 1.231&#150;40). An anonymous letter to Wolsey of 1520 touching on the duke of Buckingham's treason also included articles of indenture between Vaux and Henry VII for Gu&icirc;nes, and advised Wolsey to review them and determine if Vaux had fulfilled the terms. Vaux was present at Buckingham's indictment for treason, on 8 May 1521 in the London Guildhall, and with Sir William Sandys led the duke through London to the Tower after his conviction. He was mentioned as briefly harbouring a chaplain of Buckingham's after his death, but does not seem to have suffered from this incident.<h2>
<a name="Courtlife"></a>Court life</h2>Vaux's jousting appearances seemed more for service or show than sport. He and his brother-in-law Sir Richard Guildford were prominent at the jousts held for the marriage of Prince Arthur and Katherine of Aragon; according to one chronicler they &#145;were ever for the most party in the feld every day of the justes &hellip; and by them the Kynges Grace did sende his myende and messages into the feld&#146;  (Kipling, 65/543&#150;9). Vaux played a similar role at the Field of Cloth of Gold, keeping order on the field rather than jousting, not surprisingly considering his age. On and off the field, his rich apparel prompted comment. At the wedding jousts he and Guildford wore &#145;great and massy cheynes of golde abought ther nekkes&#146;  (ibid., 65/547). The day of the marriage, Vaux wore &#145;a goune of purpyll velvet the which was pygth or sett wyth pesis of gold soo thyk &amp; massy, that yt was Reportid to be worth In gold beside the sylk &amp; furre M li&#146;. Two days later he wore a &#145;coler of Essis&#146; which weighed &#145;viiiC li. of noblys&#146;  (Thomas and Thornley, 311&#150;12). Vaux made another notable appearance at the jousts to celebrate the birth of a prince to Henry VIII and Queen Katherine in February 1511. On the second day of the tourney, he wore &#145;a gown of Goldsmyth werk to the knees and theryn a Furre of Rygth broun &amp; Fyne Sablys of grete valu&#146;  (ibid., 371).<br>
<br>The family was well represented at other court functions: a Lady Vaux, probably Katharine, was at Prince Arthur's baptism in September 1486. In 1487 Vaux was one of twelve knights of the body who alternated in bearing a canopy over Queen Elizabeth's litter as she was borne through London to Westminster before her coronation, while Katharine Vaux was with the queen when she sat in state the day after her coronation. Vaux was at the feast to celebrate Prince Henry's creation as duke of York at All Hallows in 1494, and was one of the knights with Prince Henry when he met Katherine of Aragon at St George's Field to escort her into the city of London in November 1501. He was in procession and presumably at the feast to celebrate the receipt of Wolsey's red hat in November 1515 and was among those who bore the canopy over the Princess Mary at her baptism, on 20 February 1516.<br>
<br>Vaux may have resided mainly at Harrowden after 1486; on 27 July 1511, Henry VIII visited &#145;Sir Nicholas Vaux's place&#146;, presumably Harrowden. Yet recognizances of February and July 1517, and October 1518, also describe him as of Norton, Northamptonshire (probably Green's Norton, part of his wife's inheritance), and Norton as well as Harrowden figures in his will. From 1502 his duties took him between Northamptonshire and France, and Anstruther suggests he spent winters in England and the rest of the year at Gu&icirc;nes. Vaux's interest in improving his lands led him into enclosure, and a 1517 survey discovered offences against the acts forbidding enclosures on his lands in Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, and Bedfordshire, for which he was later pardoned. He also had to seek pardon in 1518 for failing to appear to submit accounts for his term as sheriff.<br>
<br>It was said that Vaux &#145;lieth very sore&#146; in Gu&icirc;nes on 22 September 1522, but death held off until after his creation, before 28 April 1523, as first Baron Vaux of Harrowden. A letter of 14 May said Vaux was very ill, and he probably died that same day at the hospital of the knights of St John of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell. His will requested burial at Harrowden, Blackfriars in London, or Gu&icirc;nes, depending on his residence at death, and it is believed he was buried at Blackfriars.<br>
