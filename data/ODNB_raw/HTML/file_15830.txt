<span class="headword">Kenningham <span class="st"> [Kynyngham]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1399), <span class="occ">Carmelite friar and theologian</span>, probably came from Suffolk; though his family is unknown, he mentions in one of his surviving works that his father had died when he was a boy. He entered the Carmelite order at the Ipswich convent, but must have been sent to Oxford in the 1360s, since by the time of his determinations against John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) he was already a doctor of theology. In 1393 he was elected prior provincial of the order in England; on 18 May 1399 he was appointed vicar provincial for the Irish province, but six days before this he had died at the York convent and was buried there. He preached before Richard II on All Saints' day 1392. In 1392&#150;3 and 1397&#150;8 he acted as confessor to John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, was at various times resident in Gaunt's household, and was witness to his will. On 27 January 1399, shortly before his own death, Kenningham was summoned by Richard II to attend a council at Oxford to advise on possible solutions to the papal schism.<br>
<br>Kenningham disputed with his younger contemporary John Wyclif through a series of exchanges in Oxford, probably conducted about 1372&#150;3. Neither side of the argument survives complete, and aspects of the sequence remain unclear; part of Kenningham's side is preserved in the manuscript of <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span>, while Wyclif's contributions are found much more fragmentarily in a single copy. It would seem that the early stages on both sides are lost; Kenningham, in the first (perhaps summarized) document, refers to material <i>in ultima determinatione mea</i>  (<span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span>, 4&#150;13); this was answered by Wyclif  (ibid., 453&#150;76), followed by another riposte from Kenningham  (ibid., 14&#150;42), and another by Wyclif that in the single manuscript breaks off very early in the argument  (ibid., 477&#150;80). In all of the material thus far Kenningham speaks of Wyclif as <i>magister</i>, whereas Wyclif refers to his opponent as <i>doctor</i>. The third and fourth determinations of Kenningham  (ibid., 43&#150;72, 73&#150;103), between which Wyclif had evidently replied, frequently speak of Wyclif as <i>doctor</i>; this makes probable a date of 1372&#150;3 for the sequence. The debate primarily concerned the implications for the study of scripture of Wyclif's views on universals, in particular the problem of the compatibility of Wyclif's insistence that &#145;si aliquid fuerit vel erit, ipsum est&#146; (&#145;if anything has been or will be, it has real existence at the present&#146;; ibid., 8) with certain biblical passages that seem only intelligible if understood as contingent or indeed temporary. Other topics included the endowment of the church; Kenningham also tantalizingly states that Wyclif &#145;dicit se non credere quod Christus dixit panem esse corpus suum&#146; (&#145;says that he does not believe that Christ said that the bread is his body&#146;; ibid., 54), and endeavours to enlarge the sense of <i>esse</i>, both pointing forward to his final eucharistic views. Though Kenningham nowhere resorts to polemic, his tone often appears slightly patronizing and ironic; he claims that Wyclif was forced to retreat from some of his points, a claim that the fragmentary material from the other side in part bears out.<br>
<br>Whether Kenningham continued to oppose Wyclif in Oxford after 1373 is unclear. On 28 May 1382 he was present at the Blackfriars Council in London when a list of Wyclif's views were anonymously condemned; two days later he preached the sermon after the procession in London, in which, on the commission of the archbishop of Canterbury, he pronounced the conclusions false and all those excommunicate who taught, favoured, or heard them. Ten years later, on 28 May 1392, he was present at the trial of the Cistercian Henry Crump in the Carmelite house at Stamford.<br>
<br>The Carmelite John Bale lists nineteen works of his earlier co-religionist, all but two with incipits. Five of these correspond to the surviving parts of Kenningham's arguments with Wyclif in <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span> (the last is divided by Bale into two parts). Though no entry appears for Kenningham in Bale's <span class="italic">Index</span>, the remainder derive from Bale's early access to Carmelite sources; several notes concerning him survive in Bale's notebooks. None of these other works has so far been traced, and there is no reason to connect a commentary on <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span> in BL, Royal MS 2 D.iv, ascribed at the start to Kyngisham, with the opponent of Wyclif.<br>
