<span class="headword">Baker,  William Garrard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1815, <em>d.</em> 1902), <span class="occ">manufacturing chemist</span>, baptized at Chelmsford, Essex, was the eldest of five sons (there were also two daughters) of William Baker, a chemist and druggist in Chelmsford. Baker's early life and education remain obscure and it seems likely that he was educated locally before being, as he himself recalled, apprenticed to his father. When he was qualified, he went to London, occupying himself in managing &#145;a business in London for my father, waiting for something to turn up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chemist and Druggist</span>, 30 Jan 1897).<br>
<br>In 1839 the opportunity for which Baker had been waiting appeared, when Thomas Grimwade retired from the chemical manufacturing business he and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50653/', "John May (1809&#150;1893)")</script> (together with Joseph Pickett who had died in 1835) had established in Battersea. May needed a new partner and he and Baker quickly came to terms, signing a partnership agreement in 1840. Since 1834 the factory had been on rented land but in 1841 the partners were able to buy the piece of land known as Garden Wharf, thereby securing for themselves a more permanent position in Battersea, then very much an industrial area. In the event the business stayed there until 1934, well after the time of both May and Baker. On 24 April 1851 Baker married, at Battersea parish church, Elizabeth Ann (1822/3&#150;1863), daughter of Charles Wix, deceased, of Battersea. They had at least four daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>For the first two or three decades Baker took charge of the manufacturing, and the prize medals awarded to May and Baker's products&#151;acids and metallic salts&#151;at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Exhibition of 1855 suggest that he was skilled and able at doing so. May took responsibility for the marketing of their products and both men became members of the Pharmaceutical Society, formed in 1841 to protect the interests of chemists and druggists. In the 1860s the partners took on a young man, Thomas Tyrer, as an apprentice and he stayed with the firm after he completed his apprenticeship, gradually taking over more responsibility for the manufacturing side of the business.<br>
<br>In 1876 John May retired, selling his interest (two-thirds as opposed to Baker's one-third) in the firm to Richard Heath, a solicitor in Warwick, who was eager to invest in a chemical business which would provide employment for one of his two stepsons, William Blenkinsop. Although Baker was, by virtue of his age and experience, the senior partner in the new partnership with Heath, it was Tyrer, now admitted as a junior partner, who supervised the training of Blenkinsop and who, to all intents and purposes, as the surviving correspondence makes clear, was running the business. In the 1870s Baker's health was poor, with rheumatic gout and neuralgia troubling him, and he was a widower, but he refused to leave the business. Both Tyrer and Blenkinsop expressed their doubts as to his ability to make any contribution to the firm, Tyrer suggesting that he came into the office only to criticize and that his tendency had been always to wait, like Mr Micawber, for something to turn up. In 1883 Blenkinsop told his stepfather that Baker, now in his late sixties, did little except &#145;appear on 'Change&#146; for the firm; the purchase of raw materials, particularly expensive ones such as quicksilver (used to make the mercurial compounds which were then the only remedy for venereal disease) was a delicate business&#151;one which according to Blenkinsop, Baker did not handle particularly well.<br>
<br>In 1890 Heath proposed to end the partnership and incorporate the business, suggesting that both Baker and Tyrer should retire. Lengthy and by no means amicable negotiations followed resulting in the incorporation of May and Baker Ltd and the departure of Tyrer. However, despite his age, Baker refused to go and was made a director of the new company; also a director from 1891 until his death in 1893 was John May, a recognition that the names of the two men who had built up the company carried considerable weight in the industry.<br>
<br>It was not until 1897, at the age of eighty-two, that Baker finally retired and went to live in Brighton. From there he still travelled up to Battersea for board meetings, a journey attended with considerable ceremony. He travelled with his invalid chair on the train from Brighton to Clapham Junction; there two May and Baker employees met him and lifted him into a brougham for the short journey to Battersea where he was carried into the office at Garden Wharf. His refusal to sever his connection with the business seems to have been driven as much by a need for remuneration&#151;Tyrer suggested that Baker had an expensive family and was himself a spendthrift&#151;as by his fondness for the company he had helped to create.<br>
<br>Baker died at his home, 9 Compton Avenue, Brighton, on 16 May 1902. May and Baker passed first into the hands of the Blenkinsop family and then, in the 1920s, into the ownership of the French chemical company Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc. Its discovery and development of the sulphonamide drug M &amp; B 693 in the late 1930s gave the company a considerable place in the history of the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
