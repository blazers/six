<span class="headword">Ommanney, Sir  Erasmus</span>  (1814&#150;1904), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in London on 22 May 1814, was the seventh son, in a family of eight sons and three daughters, of Sir Francis Molyneux Ommanney (1774?&#150;1840), a naval agent and from 1818 to 1826 MP for Barnstaple, and his wife, Georgiana Frances, daughter of Joshua Hawkes. The Ommanneys had long distinguished themselves in the navy: Erasmus's grandfather was Rear-Admiral Cornthwaite Ommanney (<i>d</i>. 1801), and his uncles were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20757/', "Admiral Sir John Acworth Ommanney")</script> and Admiral Henry Manaton Ommanney. Major-General Edward Lacon Ommanney RE was his eldest brother and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35315/', "Prebendary George Druce Wynne Ommanney")</script> was a younger brother. Ommanney entered the navy in August 1826 under his uncle, John Ommanney, then captain of the <i>Albion</i> (74 guns), which in December convoyed to Lisbon the troops sent to protect Portugal against the Spanish invasion. The ship then went to the Mediterranean, and on 20 October 1827 took part in the battle of Navarino. The captured flag of the Turkish commander-in-chief was handed down by seniority among the surviving officers until 1890, when Ommanney, the sole survivor, presented it to the king of Greece.<br>
<br>In 1833 Ommanney passed his examination, after which he served for a short time as mate in the brig <i>Pantaloon</i>. On 10 December 1835 he was promoted lieutenant, and in the same month was appointed to the transport <i>Cove</i> (Captain Clark Ross), which was ordered to Baffin's Bay to release a number of whalers caught in the ice. He received the special commendation of the Admiralty for this dangerous service. In October 1836 he joined the frigate <i>Pique</i> (Captain Henry John Rous), and a year later was appointed to the <i>Donegal</i> (78 guns), as flag-lieutenant to his uncle, now Sir John Ommanney, commander-in-chief on the Lisbon and Mediterranean stations. He was promoted commander on 9 October 1840, and from August 1841 to the end of 1844 served on board the steam sloop <i>Vesuvius</i> in the Mediterranean. Here he was employed on the coast of Morocco for the protection of British subjects during the French hostilities, which included the bombardment of Tangier by the Prince de Joinville's squadron. He married, on 27 February 1844, Emily Mary (<i>d</i>. 1857), daughter of Samuel Smith of HM Dockyard, Malta. Their son, Erasmus Austin Ommanney, entered the navy in 1863, retired with the rank of commander in 1879, took orders in 1883, and was vicar of St Michael's, Southsea, from 1892 to 1911. Ommanney was promoted captain on 9 November 1846, and in 1847&#150;8 was employed under the government commission during the famine in Ireland, carrying into effect relief measures and the new poor law.<br>
<br>When Captain Horatio Austin was appointed to the <i>Resolute</i> for the command of the Franklin search expedition in February 1850 he chose his friend Ommanney as second in command. The <i>Resolute</i> and Ommanney's ship, the <i>Assistance</i>, each had a steam tender, this being the first occasion on which steam was used for Arctic navigation. This expedition was also the first to organize an extensive system of sledge journeys, by means of which the coast of Prince of Wales Land was surveyed. On 25 August 1850 Ommanney discovered the first traces of the fate of Sir John Franklin; these proved that his ships had wintered at Beechey Island. The expedition returned to England in October 1851.<br>
<br>In December 1851 Ommanney was appointed deputy controller-general of the coastguard, and held this post until 1854, when, on the outbreak of the Russian war, he commissioned the <i>Eurydice</i> as senior officer of a small squadron for the White Sea, where he blockaded Archangel, stopped the coasting trade, and destroyed government property. His White Sea service culminated in a battle between his squadron and a Russian monastery at Archangel. In 1855 he was appointed to the <i>Hawke</i>, blockship for the Baltic, and was employed chiefly as senior officer in the Gulf of Riga, where the service was one of rigid blockade, varied by occasional skirmishes with the Russian gunboats and batteries. Ommanney's period in the Baltic was marked by his aggressive operations against Russian shore positions and gunboats, summoning defenceless towns to surrender, and his exaggerated reports of successes.<br>
<br>In October 1857 Ommanney was appointed to the <i>Brunswick</i> (80 guns), going out to the West Indies, and was senior officer at Col&oacute;n when the filibuster William Walker attempted to invade Nicaragua. The <i>Brunswick</i> afterwards joined the Channel Fleet, and she was sent as a reinforcement to the Mediterranean during the Franco-Austrian War of 1859. Ommanney was not again afloat after being paid off in 1860, but was senior officer at Gibraltar from 1862 until he was promoted to flag rank on 12 November 1864.<br>
<br>In 1862 Ommanney married Mary, daughter of Thomas A. Stone of Curzon Street, London; she died on 1 September 1906, aged eighty-one. In March 1867 he was created CB; on 14 July 1871 he was promoted to vice-admiral, and he accepted retirement on 1 January 1875. He was advanced to admiral on the retired list on 1 August 1877, in which year he was knighted for his scientific work in the Arctic. He had been elected FRS in 1868 for the same reason, and to the end of his life continued to take a great interest in geographical work and service subjects. He attended meetings of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal United Service Institution (he was for many years a councillor of both bodies) and of the British Association. He was also a JP for Hampshire and a member of the Thames conservancy. In June 1902 he was made KCB.<br>
<br>An officer of some distinction in Arctic exploration, Ommanney died on 21 December 1904 at his son's home, St Michael's vicarage, St Michael's Road, Southsea, Hampshire, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.<br>
