<span class="headword">Laing,  James</span>  (1803&#150;1872), <span class="occ">missionary in Cape Colony</span>, was born at Thirstane Hill, Durrisdeer, south-east of Sanquhar in Dumfriesshire, on 6 September 1803, the third of four sons of Robert Laing, a shepherd, and his wife, Catherine Johnstone. When he was five the family moved to Knockconey Dod near Thirstane Hill. Having been schooled at home and at the Sanquhar parish school he entered Edinburgh University in 1822, where he studied classics, philosophy, theology, and a range of medical subjects. At Edinburgh he was strongly influenced by the theologian and social reformer Thomas Chalmers, who held the chair of divinity, and he attended Chalmers's theological class during the 1829&#150;30 session. He was received by the Glasgow Missionary Society as a candidate and was designated in the Tron Church, Glasgow, to the office and work of a missionary within the society on 31 August 1830, when he was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Under the auspices of the Glasgow Missionary Society, Laing was assigned to Burnshill mission on the eastern Cape frontier in South Africa. On 13 August 1830, two months before his appointed date of departure for the Cape, Laing married Margaret S. G. Drummond in St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh. They sailed from Liverpool Bay in the brig <i>Aquila</i> on 11 October 1830. On 1 January 1831 the <i>Aquila</i> docked in Cape Town, where they spent several months before embarking for Algoa Bay and the eastern frontier. After a brief stay in Grahamstown they spent a further few months at Tyhume, where Laing was introduced to the customs and language of the amaXhosa among whom he was to work.<br>
<br>Burnshill lay on the Keiskamma River, beyond the &#145;ceded territory&#146; expropriated by the Cape governor, Lord Charles Somerset, from Ngqika, chief of the amaRharhabe, in 1819, ostensibly to create a buffer zone between the colony and the territory of the amaXhosa. The fourth Glasgow Missionary Society station, Burnshill was established on 13 June 1830 by William Chalmers and Alexander McDiarmid. Laing ministered at Burnshill for just under thirty of his forty-one years as a missionary (1831&#150;72).<br>
<br>By 1834 there were whispers of war, and life on the mission stations became increasingly tense. Burnshill enjoyed the protection of Suthu, great wife of the late Ngqika, and his sons Maqoma and Tyhali, and so was less threatened by either the colonial forces or the amaNgqika than other mission stations. Laing and his wife gave asylum to fleeing traders and their families, to fellow missionaries, and even to relatives of Maqoma himself. However, in February 1835 the Laing family and the mission adherents were taken under military escort to Grahamstown where they spent more than nine months. Their first son, Robert, born at Burnshill on 9 October 1832, was hydrocephalic and died on 17 March 1835. A second son, John Drummond Laing, was born two weeks later, on 31 March.<br>
<br>After returning to Burnshill at the end of November 1835 Laing resumed his ministry among the amaNgqika. His wife had suffered chronic ill health from the time of her departure from Scotland, and she died on 24 June 1837. Five years later, on 27 July 1842, Laing married Isabella Mirrlees, niece of his longtime friend Patrick Falconer, in St Stephen's Church, Cape Town.<br>
<br>An incident connected with James and Isabella Laing's journey back to Burnshill in September 1842 proved to have far-reaching implications both for them personally and for the future of the Scottish missionary effort on the frontier. In hiring two oxen for their wagon, the Revd John Bennie, who was stationed at the newly instituted seminary at Lovedale, betrayed a trust with their owners. As a result Lovedale, which later trained many of South Africa's leaders, was in severe danger of having to close down. To resolve the issue, in 1843 the presbytery of Kaffraria instructed Laing to replace Bennie at Lovedale.<br>
<br>Laing remained at Lovedale for nearly twelve years, interrupted only when he and his family took refuge in the Kat River valley during the Cape Frontier War of 1846&#150;7 (the &#145;war of the axe&#146;). They finally left Lovedale for Burnshill on 1 March 1855 and set about rebuilding their home and mission which had been destroyed during the Cape Frontier War of 1850&#150;51. Laing's ministry from then on became far more itinerant. He travelled by wagon deep into the Transkei, and Isabella accompanied him on many of these extended journeys. In August 1843, along with other members of the presbytery of Kaffraria, he had seceded from the Church of Scotland to join the Free Church of Scotland, and in 1860 he was appointed to represent the presbytery at the general assembly of the Free Church in Edinburgh. He took advantage of his first (and only) return to Scotland to raise money to set up printing and bookbinding as a new branch in the industrial department of the Lovedale seminary. He also engaged a teacher in the English department in the seminary and tried, unsuccessfully, to raise money for erecting schools at the outstations.<br>
<br>Laing played a part in seeing through the translation of the entire <span class="roman">Bible</span> into isiXhosa in 1865, despite having initially struggled to master the Xhosa language. During the jubilee of the Glasgow mission held at Burnshill on 15 November 1871 he presented a paper entitled &#145;The history of the mission, with special reference to those who have whither been removed by death, or returned to Europe&#146;. He paid particular tribute to women missionaries, pointing out that they were rarely noticed in public reports. In January 1872 he contracted pneumonia, and within a week of doing so he fell into a delirium in which he imagined he saw his friends gathered around him and chattered volubly to them in isiXhosa. On his deathbed the extent of his acculturation into the societal microcosm which he shared with the amaXhosa had become apparent. When he died, at Burnshill, on 28 January 1872, he did so, at least linguistically, as an umXhosa.<br>
<br>Laing was known for his diligence, simplicity, geniality, and constancy. In a tribute signed by J. Masingata and published in the Lovedale newspaper <span class="italic">Isigidimi samaXosa</span> (1 March 1872) Laing was described as <i>Indoda ebisitanda</i> (&#145;the man who loved us&#146;).<br>
