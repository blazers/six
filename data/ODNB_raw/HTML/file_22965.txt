<span class="headword">Quincy,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1722), <span class="occ">apothecary and physician</span>, was apprenticed to an apothecary, and afterwards practised as an apothecary in London. He was a dissenter and a whig, a friend of Richard Mead, and an enemy of John Woodward. In 1717 he published a <span class="italic">Lexicon physico-medicum</span>, dedicated to John, duke of Montagu, who had just been admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians. It is based on the medical lexicon of Bartholomew Castellus, published at Basel in 1628, and went through eleven editions, of which the last two appeared respectively in 1794 and 1811 (greatly revised). Quincy's <span class="italic">English Dispensatory</span> (1718), which had run to twelve editions by 1749, contains a complete account of the materia medica and of therapeutics, and many of the prescriptions contained in it had long-lasting popularity.<br>
<br>Quincy studied mathematics and the philosophy of Newton, and received the degree of MD from the University of Edinburgh for his <span class="italic">Medicina statica Britannica</span> (1712), a translation of the <span class="italic">Aphorisms</span> of Sanctorius, a second edition of which appeared in 1720. In 1719 he published a scurrilous <span class="italic">Examination</span> of Woodward's <span class="italic">State of Physick and Diseases</span>. A reply, entitled <span class="italic">An Account of Dr Quincy's Examination, by N. N. of the Middle Temple</span> (1719), speaks of him as a bankrupt apothecary, a charge to which he made no reply in the second edition of his <span class="italic">Examination</span>, published, with a further &#145;letter to Dr Woodward&#146;, in 1720. In the same year he published an edition of the <span class="italic"><i>Loimologia</i>; of an historical account of the plague in London</span>, by Nathaniel Hodges, and a collection of <span class="italic">Medico-Physical Essays</span> (1720) on ague, fevers, gout, leprosy, king's evil, and other diseases, which show that his main skill was as an apothecary. He considered dried millipedes good for tuberculous lymphatic glands, but considered the royal touch a method &#145;that can take place only on a deluded imagination&#146;, which had been &#145;justly banished with the superstition and bigotry that introduced it&#146;. Joseph Collet, governor of Fort St George, was one of his patrons, and Quincy printed in 1713 a laudatory poem on their mutual friend, the Revd Joseph Stennett (1663&#150;1713).<br>
<br>Quincy died in 1722, and in 1723 his <span class="italic">Praelectiones pharmaceuticae</span>, lectures which had been delivered at his own house, were published with a preface by Peter Shaw.<br>
<br>Norman Moore<span class="italic">, rev. </span> Michael Bevan </div>
