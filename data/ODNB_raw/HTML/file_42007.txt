<span class="headword">Dymoke <span class="st"> [Dymmok]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1340&#150;<em>c.</em>1580), <span class="occ">king's champions</span>, claimed their right to that office through their tenure of Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire. The family's first successful claimant was <a name="cosubject_8364"></a><span class="headword">Sir John [ii] Dymoke</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), son of John [i] Dymoke and Felicia Harevill. He married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Ludlow, who inherited Scrivelsby from her grandmother Joan, the youngest daughter of Philip Marmion.<br>
<br>In 1355 Dymoke was pardoned at the request of Edward, the Black Prince, for receiving John Ludlow, indicted for two deaths. A member of John of Gaunt's Lancastrian affinity from at least 1369, he was paid an annuity of 20 marks in 1370&#150;72. Sir John was appointed to peace commissions in 1364, 1368, 1371, 1375, and 1377 and represented Lincolnshire in the parliaments of 1372, 1373, and 1377. Dymoke served on commissions of oyer and terminer, array, and walls and ditches within the county and he (or his father) was briefly escheator for Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, and Rutland from January to November 1341. In 1376 during a two-year term as escheator for Lincolnshire (1375&#150;7) he took legal action through an oyer and terminer commission against those who, he alleged, had assaulted him and tried to prevent him from exercising his duties.<br>
<br>Sir John asserted the right to act as king's champion before the coronation of Richard II in 1377. A rival claimant, Baldwin Freville, however, alleged the right to perform the same service through his tenure of Tamworth Castle. The respective positions were based on claims initiated at Edward III's coronation in 1327 and devolved from the property ownership of a common ancestor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18080/', "Philip Marmion (d. 1291)")</script>. There is no direct evidence, though, that Marmion had performed the service himself or was a descendant of the champions to the dukes of Normandy, nor that Scrivelsby or Tamworth were linked to champion service. Nevertheless, in 1327 Henry Hillary, then tenant of Scrivelsby and second husband of Marmion's youngest daughter, claimed that the manor was held by grand serjeanty directly from the king and that the tenant had the duty on coronation day of providing a well-armed knight on horseback to prove in combat, if necessary, that the king crowned on that day was the true and rightful heir of the kingdom. Hillary's claim was challenged by Alexander Freville, whose wife, one of Marmion's granddaughters, had inherited Tamworth. In the event, Edward III declined both offers, but Hillary, who petitioned that his proffer be recorded and consideration taken of his expenses, was granted his fee.<br>
<br>The parties' contentions of 1377 were duly placed before the court of claims. On the basis of better records and evidence, the lord steward, the duke of Lancaster, found in favour of Dymoke. Edward III and the Black Prince were also said to have frequently asserted Dymoke's right. Baldwin Freville was given the opportunity of a further hearing if within a time limit set by the court he could provide the necessary evidence. In default of his appearance he would be forever excluded and Dymoke would perform in the right of his wife. Freville failed to appear at the appointed time. The Frevilles resurrected their claim for the coronation of Henry IV, but the court was not convinced.<br>
<br>Sir John died about April 1381. Margaret presented their son Thomas [i] Dymoke (<i>d</i>. 1422) to act as champion in 1399, though Henry IV was supposedly overheard to say, &#145;If need be, Sir Thomas, I shall personally relieve you of this task&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Adam Usk</span>, 73). Sir Thomas also performed the service at Henry V's coronation, and his son, Sir Philip Dymoke (<i>d</i>. 1455), at that of Henry VI.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_8367"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas [ii] Dymoke</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1470), the son of Sir Philip, married Margaret, daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28998/', "Leo Welles, Baron Welles (c.1406&#150;1461)")</script>. Thomas [ii] was knighted at the battle of Northampton on 9 July 1460 and later acted as champion at the coronation of Edward IV. In December 1461 he was granted for the life of Elizabeth, wife of William Tailboys, a third of all the manors and lands of which that rebel was seised. Three months later Dymoke (with John Denham and Thomas Burgh) received a further grant for the life of the same Elizabeth of lands in Lincolnshire and Durham. Sir Thomas [ii] was appointed to the peace commission in Lindsey in 1463 and 1467. During the unsettled period marking the Wars of the Roses, he became embroiled in a competition for local dominance between his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28999/', "Richard Welles, Lord Welles")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28998/', "Welles, Leo")</script>], and Thomas Burgh, Edward IV's master of horse. In this private feud Burgh's manor at Gainsborough was attacked and destroyed, causing the king to summon the ringleaders to appear before him at Westminster in March 1470. Dymoke and Welles dutifully obeyed, but were sent on to Huntingdon where Edward had marched as a result of a fresh outbreak of violence. The leader of the new rebellion appeared to be Welles's son, Robert, who was hailed as the &#145;great captain of the commons of Lincolnshire&#146;. Dymoke and Welles were pardoned on 6 March, but Welles was forced to demand his son's immediate submission to the king's forces under threat that Dymoke and he would be put to death. The exhortation obviously failed as both men were summarily executed at Stamford on 12 March. On 25 April 1470 an order was issued to seize all the lands and possessions of the rebels. If Sir Thomas was identical with the Thomas Dymoke of Horncastle, merchant, to whom a pardon was granted four months later, hopes of remission were dashed when the political tide turned again, for in December 1471 Scrivelsby, Horncastle, and the other Dymoke estates were granted to Richard, duke of Gloucester.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_8365"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert [i] Dymoke</span>  (<em>c.</em>1461&#150;1545)<span class="occ"></span>, Sir Thomas [ii]'s heir, married Anne, daughter of John Sparrow of London. Robert's eventful minority included in May 1471 an order to arrest him and his mother. The following year his custody and wardship were entrusted to Robert Radcliffe. Dymoke was given licence to inherit his father's lands and those of Robert Waterton in 1482. Account of the former (which in addition to Scrivelsby included the Lincolnshire manors of Coningsby, Thornton, Donington, and Horncastle among others) was to be rendered after an inquiry in 1483 into the possessions of named rebels. In 1485 he requested an exemplification that any act of forfeiture should not extend to Waterton's lands.<br>
<br>Dymoke was knighted on 5 July 1483 before Richard III's coronation, at which he first performed his duties as king's champion. It is recorded that at the second course of the banquet Dymoke rode into the hall and proclaimed that he would fight anyone who dared to say that Richard was not the lawful king. The whole hall was silent, but Dymoke having thrown down his gauntlet, the company cried out &#145;King Richard&#146;. This happened three times. Sir Robert was then brought a cup of wine covered and when he had drunk, he cast out the remaining wine and departed with the cup  (BL, Add. MS 6113, fol. 22). He later acted as champion at the coronations of Henry VII (1485) and Henry VIII (1509).<br>
<br>Sir Robert [i] Dymoke was appointed sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1484, 1502, and 1509 and became mayor of Boston in 1520. From 1486 he served on many administrative and judicial commissions within the county including peace commissions for Lindsey (1486&#150;1507, 1520&#150;32, and 1539). He was made a banneret in 1512 and served as treasurer of the rearward in Henry VIII's invasion of France in 1513. Henry appointed him treasurer of the captured city of Tournai, a post he occupied until 1515. In 1522 Dymoke provided the sum of &pound;200 towards the king's expenses for regaining the French crown. For at least eight years (1527&#150;35) he was chancellor to the queen's household, though he is also described as Katherine of Aragon's &#145;almoner and receiver&#146; and &#145;queen's chamberlain&#146; under Anne Boleyn. During the Lincolnshire rebellion of 1536 the rebels came to fetch Sir Robert from Scrivelsby together with his sons Edward, the current sheriff, and Arthur. Although a banner depicting the family arms was used at the rebels' head, the family's conduct, like that of the other leading gentry caught up in the revolt, attracted suspicion but no punishment from the king.<br>
<br>Sir Robert died on 15 April 1545. His will dated 1543 desired his son Edward [i] to appoint two discreet and honest priests and one poor man for five years to say mass daily in the church at Scrivelsby and pray for the souls of Robert, his wife, and his parents.<br>
<br>Sir Edward [i] Dymoke (<i>d</i>. 1567), who married Anne, daughter of George Tailboys, Baron Kyme, was the champion at the coronations of Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth. His son, <a name="cosubject_8366"></a><span class="headword">Robert [ii] Dymoke</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1580)<span class="occ"></span>, married Bridget, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5679/', "Edward Fiennes de Clinton, first earl of Lincoln (1512&#150;1585)")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73234/', "Elizabeth Blount")</script>, and had at least four sons, Edward [ii], Robert [iii], Nicholas, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6985/', "Tailboys Dymoke")</script>. Robert [ii], who suffered from a paralysis in later life, may have died in prison as a result of his unyielding recusancy. He was buried at Scrivelsby on 26 September 1580.<br>
