<span class="headword">Ogle,  Owen <span class="st"> [Ewyn]</span></span>, second Baron Ogle  (<em>c.</em>1440&#150;1486), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was probably born in Northumberland, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20615/', "Robert (VI)Ogle, first Baron Ogle (c.1406&#150;1469)")</script>, and his wife, Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1478), daughter of Sir Alexander Kirkby of Kirkby Ireleth, Lancashire. His elder brother, Sir Robert (VII) Ogle, was apparently dead by 20 October 1465, when Owen was associated with his father in making a grant of land at Great Tossan. By 26 May 1467 he had married Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Hilton, who brought him lands in Cumberland. Owen Ogle was said to be aged thirty at his father's death late in 1469, but whereas the first Lord Ogle had been prominent in the establishment of the Yorkist regime in Northumberland, his successor played little part in either local or national affairs. A chancery error continued to include Robert, Lord Ogle, in commissions of the peace for Northumberland between 1471 and 1485; it is unlikely that Owen served in this capacity as his father's heir. On 14 February 1473 Owen Ogle was granted a general pardon for offences committed before 30 September 1471, and all debts and accounts due to the king before 29 September 1469. The latter portion of the pardon was probably issued in respect of sums owed by his father. Between 1471 and 1474, as Ewyn, Lord Ogle, he was one of a number of lay and ecclesiastical notables who set their seals to a certificate concerning the Delaval inheritance, but elsewhere he was still being styled esquire in 1480, though in his first summons to parliament&#151;issued as late as 15 November 1482&#151;he is named as Owen Ogle of Ogle, knight.<br>
<br>Although a disability of some kind cannot be ruled out, the likeliest cause of Owen Ogle's inactivity is poverty. Not until 1484 was he licensed to enter the possessions of his father and mother. The latter died in 1478, having made a will bequeathing her Lancashire inheritance to her daughter Isabella, and to the latter's husband and children, and making no mention of her son at all. The fact that the lands disposed of in 1484 were specifically said to have been those of both his parents may indicate that they had been covered by a joint settlement of some sort; that the licence was accompanied by a pardon, &#145;upon al contemptes etc don upon the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">Harleian MS 433</span>, 1.190), suggests that Lord Ogle had chafed at being kept out of his inheritance, and may even have taken possession of it in the course of a dispute. None the less, in 1485 he conveyed Ogle Castle to feoffees, with the result that it does not appear among the Northumberland estates listed in his inquisition post mortem. These, eighteen manors or fractions of manors, were valued at only &pound;111 13<i>s</i>. per annum, and even allowing for undervaluation and for the absence of Ogle (valued at &pound;20 in 1492), they represent an exceptionally low income for a baron. The fact that Owen Ogle had apparently been knighted by 1482, and was summoned to parliament in that year, may have resulted from involvement in the Anglo-Scottish hostilities that broke out in 1480. The English commander was Richard, duke of Gloucester, and in 1485 Ogle was one of the northern barons and gentry said by <span class="italic">The Ballad of Bosworth Field</span> to have fought for Richard, now Richard III, at Bosworth. If he did indeed fight against the future Henry VII, Ogle cannot be shown to have suffered in consequence, and in any case he died soon afterwards, on 1 September 1486. He was succeeded by his son Ralph Ogle. A heraldic visitation also names a second son, Robert (VIII), and a daughter, Joan, who married Robert Clavering. Owen's widow, Eleanor, who was still alive in 1515, remarried twice; her later husbands were George Percy and Henry Raynfforth.<br>
