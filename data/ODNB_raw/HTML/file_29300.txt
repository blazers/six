</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitelocke,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1833), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of John Whitelocke, steward to John, fourth earl of Ailesbury, and his wife, Sarah Liddiard (<i>d</i>. 7 June 1809). He was educated at Marlborough grammar school and Lewis Loch&eacute;e's military academy in Chelsea, London, sponsored by Lord Ailesbury. He joined the 14th foot as ensign on 14 December 1778, by the influence of Viscount Barrington, recently secretary at war, and was soon appointed adjutant, and promoted to lieutenant on 28 April 1780. In 1782 the regiment went to Jamaica, and there about 1783 he married the daughter of William Lewis, a planter, of Cornwall, Jamaica. Her brother, Matthew Lewis, was office keeper at the Colonial Office.<br>
<br>Whitelocke's promotions came through influence more than military expertise. Yet he had real administrative abilities; it was very unusual for an ensign to be made adjutant in his first year of service, but he was successful. His early aristocratic sponsorship was complemented by useful connections in the political and administrative system of the army, but he was also an able administrator. Jamaica's diseases provided plenty of opportunities for advancement for the survivors, and, with influence, this ensured promotion. Whitelocke moved to the 36th foot as captain in 1784, and as major to a new battalion of the 60th four years later. Back in the West Indies he was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the 13th foot in 1791.<br>
<br>Whitelocke first saw action in September 1793 when, with the local rank of colonel, he was sent to St Domingue (Haiti) with his own regiment reinforced by other troops. He had only 700 soldiers, but succeeded in seizing Jeremie, and advanced along the southern peninsula of the island towards the capital, Port-au-Prince. It was a complex campaign, for the French planters were divided over their response to the revolution in France, the black slaves were rebellious, and yellow fever attacked Whitelocke's men. He was reinforced in February 1794, and at the second attempt captured Tiburon and directed the storm of Fort l'Acul, which opened the way to Port-au-Prince. Superseded in overall command, he led the attacking column which took the capital in June.<br>
<br>He was sent home with dispatches, and on 1 September 1795 was promoted colonel of the 6th West India regiment; he returned, as a local brigadier-general, to the West Indies, where he was employed on administrative duties in Jamaica. He returned to Britain in 1798 to be brigadier-general in Guernsey, was promoted major-general in June 1798, and was appointed lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth in May 1799.<br>
<br>This was a remarkable rise (ensign to general in twenty years). At Portsmouth he again had administrative duties, but for those of a more martial nature he had no aptitude: he was remembered in one exercise directing regiments into collisions and swamps, then leaving subordinates to sort things out. Yet he also successfully administered a recruitment drive for the fencibles, and calmed disputes between touchy officers. It was thus reasonable that he should be made inspector-general of recruiting in November 1804. He rose to lieutenant-general in October 1805.<br>
<br>Whitelocke's career, rapid promotion, and post as inspector-general were all the result of adhesion to the Pitt regime, and the fall of Pitt's government in 1806 rendered him vulnerable. The new prime minister, Lord Grenville, was keen on retrenchment, and the new secretary of state, William Windham, had his own ideas about recruiting. The news of the capture by an unauthorized British force of Buenos Aires, and then of its recapture by the Spaniards, was therefore seen as an opportunity to remove both Whitelocke and his office.<br>
<br>Several reinforcing expeditions were sent to the River Plate, of which one, commanded by Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty, captured Montevideo. Whitelocke was appointed to command all forces, and to act as governor of the province that he was expected to conquer, on 24 February 1807. He reached Montevideo on 10 May 1807 and had to wait for a month before the final reinforcement arrived. He used the time to organize an administration, among other things starting a dual-language newspaper as a vehicle for the new government.<br>
<br>Whitelocke's chief of staff, Major-General John Leveson Gower, had even less experience of combat than Whitelocke, but he devised a plan for the conquest of Buenos Aires which Whitelocke adopted. Gower, of the family of the marquesses of Stafford, was socially much above Whitelocke, and, closeted with him on the voyage south in the frigate <i>Thisbe</i>, he persuaded Whitelocke to accept the plan. The other commanders under Whitelocke were fighting men: generals Robert Craufurd and Samuel Auchmuty and admirals George Murray and Charles Stirling had between them fought in most continents and many battles; as a group they emphasized Whitelocke's martial deficiencies. He was not unimaginative, and he could see the difficulties in attacking Buenos Aires: a population of 70,000 and a grid layout of streets, where each block of buildings was a solidly built minor fort. He walked round Montevideo one day with Craufurd, pointing out such buildings and commenting on their strength. And yet he kept to Gower's plan, which ignored all this, and asked no one else for advice.<br>
<br>One small reinforcement from England failed to arrive, but Admiral Murray contributed 220 seamen, and British merchants were enrolled as a militia to help defend Montevideo. Whitelocke concentrated all available troops into the assault force, landing at Ensenada de Barragon, 32 miles from Buenos Aires, with 8500 men, on 28 June. Whitelocke divided his force into three, and these forces marched on the city, but lost touch with each other. Colonel Mahon's group was left east of the city; the division under Gower and Craufurd drove off a defending force at the outskirts of the city; the third, under Whitelocke, arrived a day later. Whitelocke's behaviour was foul-mouthed and hectoring, and alienated many; he was clearly nervous and uncertain.<br>
<br>The approach march took five days, and used up most of the soldiers' supplies. After a day's rest, Whitelocke revealed his (that is Gower's) plan: each regiment would advance along one or two of the parallel streets as far as the waterfront, at which point it was assumed that the assault would be successful. None of the more experienced soldiers raised objections. Some soldiers were ordered to advance with unloaded muskets, and in one case Gower even ordered them to remove their flints; two corporals with axes accompanied each column. These measures were copied from Auchmuty's successful assault on Montevideo, and were intended to facilitate the reduction of strong points, but the circumstances were now different.<br>
<br>The assault began at first light on 5 July, with thirteen columns advancing simultaneously. The outermost columns, two regiments under Auchmuty on the west and half the 45th under Major Jasper Nichols on the east, established themselves at strong points, respectively the plaza de Toros and the Residencia. In the centre a weak column of dismounted dragoons made no progress at all. Between these, however, there was much fighting and a series of comprehensive British defeats. Craufurd with the light brigade was driven to take refuge in the church of San Domingo, where, surrounded and attacked by sharpshooters and artillery, he was compelled to surrender. Half of the 45th under Colonel Guard suffered a similar fate, even more quickly. Both columns of the 88th had to surrender before reaching the waterfront. The 36th had to retreat out of the city to join up with Auchmuty; he also took command of the 5th, which did reach its objectives. In all, the resistance was much fiercer than the British had expected&#151;better supplied, better armed, and more persistent. Many Spaniards in the houses were bypassed by the marching columns, and then emerged to attack the columns in the rear. A well-served and numerous artillery blocked the streets behind barricades.<br>
<br>Whitelocke knew nothing of this, for he remained all that day at his headquarters. He neither sought nor was given information until next day, when he received a demand for surrender from the Spanish commander, Santiago Liniers. He then went to Auchmuty's post and discovered the bad news. Of his force about 1200 were casualties or missing, and the Spaniards held 1800 prisoners. Whitelocke had about 5400 men available, divided into four widely separated groups. A proposal to bombard the city into surrender, using guns from the fleet, was made, but Whitelocke rejected it: he feared it would endanger the prisoners, but it was also clear that it would have failed&#151;landing anything from the ships was extremely difficult, and it would have been impossible to keep men and guns supplied. Sheer distaste for the idea was another element.<br>
<br>The only alternative was to give up the attack. Once that was decided&#151;with the concurrence of Auchmuty, Gower, and Murray&#151;the whole British position in the Plate area unravelled. Montevideo was untenable alone, and the Spaniards held the prisoners, both those in Buenos Aires and the 71st foot from the previous year, as hostages. Whitelocke had the moral courage to agree to the complete evacuation of the Plate in exchange for the prisoners and supplies for the voyage home. The organization of the forces for evacuation then brought out Whitelocke's administrative skills, and the troops were recovered and dispatched on time.<br>
<br>Whitelocke returned to England on 7 November 1807, and in January 1808 he was court-martialled at Chelsea. The government had changed again, and his former friends were back in power, but it had been the opposition's expedition. The court martial took seven weeks, and Whitelocke faced four charges covering poor diplomacy, military incompetence, and negotiation of a shameful surrender, each barely relevant to what had happened. He was found guilty and was cashiered. His fault lay in taking on a task beyond his capacity, for which those who appointed him should have shared the blame. It was also a task, in all probability, beyond the capacity of the British forces. All of those who recorded their impressions remarked that holding the Plate area against the wishes of the inhabitants was impossible: they wanted either Spanish rule or independence; a British conquest would have been extremely unpleasant, and ultimately a costly failure. Whitelocke's surrender and evacuation permitted the army to be returned to Britain to fight the real enemy, Napoleon. Many of Whitelocke's regiments went to fight in Spain later in 1808. Nevertheless he had shown himself incompetent.<br>
<br>Whitelocke made no further effort to justify himself. He lived latterly at Clifton, near Bristol, and died, aged seventy-six, on 23 October 1833, at Hall Barn Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, the seat of his son-in-law, Sir Gore Ouseley, who had married his eldest daughter. He was buried in the west aisle of Bristol Cathedral.<br>
