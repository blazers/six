<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morris,  Margaret Eleanor</span>  (1891&#150;1980), <span class="occ">teacher of dance</span>, was born on 10 March 1891 at 28 Collingham Place, Kensington, London, the daughter of an artist, William Bright Morris (1844&#150;1896), and his wife, Emily Victoria Maundrell. Her parents took her to live in Boulogne when she was a few weeks old, so she grew up both bilingual and Francophile. In 1900 she joined the Ben Greet Shakespeare Company. Child parts in Drury Lane melodramas followed, and between tours she studied classical ballet techniques with John d'Auban, the ballet master at Drury Lane Theatre. In 1907 she joined Frank Benson's Shakespearian company as <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> principal dancer and understudy to Lady Benson.<br>
<br>From the age of twelve Morris started to rebel against the limitations of classical ballet, in particular its insistence on the formal positions of the spine. In 1909 she met Isadora Duncan's brother, Raymond, who was lecturing in London on the dance and music of ancient Greece. He emphasized the significance of the six Greek positions (copied from Greek vases) with their accentuated opposition of arms and legs which used every muscle in the body to achieve body control and balance. She began to evolve a freer, more expressive style of dancing, where her emphasis was on the &#145;natural&#146; rather than the formal. In ballets which she composed, tutus and ballet shoes were never seen. She and her dancers tended to wear flowing clothes and little or no make-up; they danced in bare feet, and trained out of doors wherever possible.<br>
<br>Using her new concepts, in 1910 Morris composed <span class="italic">Dance of the Furies</span>, and trained a troupe of children to play the furies for Marie Brema's production of Gluck's <span class="italic">Orpheus</span> at the Savoy Theatre, for which she also designed the costumes and the decor. Her work met with great critical success, and her career as a choreographer was launched. She was a startlingly beautiful woman who always attracted men's attention. In 1910 she had a brief but intense love affair with the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33314/', "John Galsworthy (1867&#150;1933)")</script>. He broke off the relationship because of the pain it caused his wife; after his death Morris wrote a highly censored version in <span class="italic">My Galsworthy Story</span> (1967). With his financial support she founded a school of dancing in St Martin's Lane, London, to train children in her methods, and she formed her first touring company, Margaret Morris and her Dancing Children. Galsworthy's influence seems to have switched her career path from that of a potential leading dancer herself towards a career devoted primarily to teaching.<br>
<br>Margaret Morris not only trained dancers for the theatre but, over her long career, she translated, modified, and refined her avant-garde ideas on dance into creative exercise systems for extremely diverse groups of people. She adapted her techniques of breathing, posture, and movement so that they could be used to teach very young children, physically and mentally handicapped children, prenatal and post-natal women, and to aid post-operative recuperation. In 1922 she started the first &#145;educational school&#146; in England to combine normal educational subjects with professional training in dancing and acting. She became increasingly interested in the health-giving and remedial applications of her work. From 1925 she gave lecture-demonstrations to doctors and midwives and physiotherapists. In 1928 she published <span class="italic">The Notation of Movement</span>, which detailed the system she had been evolving and teaching since 1913, and which was publicized in the <span class="italic">Margaret Morris Movement Magazine</span>. In 1930 she passed the Chartered Society of Massage and Medical Gymnastics examination with distinction.<br>
<br>The teachers whom Morris had trained in her system of &#145;Margaret Morris movement&#146; (MMM) started to be appointed residents at schools for disabled children. In 1935, in an attempt to influence the education authorities and to obtain wider recognition as a training college, she set up a non-profit making company in her London headquarters, in Cromwell Road. By 1937 MMM was officially endorsed as relevant to the &#145;health of the nation&#146; when she was invited to become a founder member of the government's National Advisory Council for Physical Training and Recreation. The fifth marquess of Cholmondeley who, as chair of the Basic Physical Training Association, was concerned that the level of physical fitness in Britain was less than that of other nations, was impressed by Morris's creation of special exercises for each sport. He wrote an introduction to her book <span class="italic">Basic Physical Training</span> (1937). Male MMM teachers ran courses at Loughborough College, which had set up a department of physical education in 1931, offering a three-year course to men wishing to become games teachers. Arguably Morris's influence on mainstream education was at its height just before the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>It would be impossible to give a full picture of Margaret Morris without speaking of her productive partnership with the Scottish painter and sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38929/', "John Duncan Fergusson (1874&#150;1961)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64738/', "Scottish colourists")</script>], whom she first met in Paris in 1913. As both travelled widely in pursuit of their work they could not always live together, though they were always in vital communication. Their dynamic relationship is recorded in what she called her &#145;biased&#146; biography, <span class="italic">The Art of J. D. Fergusson</span> (1974). When the First World War started Fergusson joined her in London, where they started the Margaret Morris Club in Chelsea to replicate the Parisian caf&eacute; life they both adored. It became a meeting place for writers, artists, and musicians; members included Augustus John, Jacob Epstein, Katherine Mansfield, Ezra Pound, and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. In 1917 they ran a summer school in Devon, where she was dance director and he art director, and they continued to run summer schools together in Devon and in the south of France annually. Morris was Fergusson's model and his muse, while she was inevitably influenced by his delight in form and colour and his interest in Indian and Cambodian sculpture. As well as becoming an accomplished artist in her own right she increasingly incorporated modernist ideas into her dance teaching. In her choreography she created overall designs of movement, expression, and colour.<br>
<br>In 1939, when Morris had to close down her seven MMM training centres, she and Fergusson settled in Glasgow, where they set up clubs as they had in London during the First World War. These were the New Art Club and the Celtic Ballet Club. After the war she choreographed and produced ballets and toured with her new company to the USA in 1954 and Russia, Austria, and Czechoslovakia in 1958. In 1960 she launched a Scottish National Ballet which opened at the Festival Theatre, Pitlochry, and afterwards toured leading theatres in Britain. When Fergusson died in 1961 she closed down her Glasgow school but remained active in Glasgow, at the age of eighty-one training dancers for a production of <span class="italic">Hair</span>. During the last years of her life she concentrated on the establishment of MMM training centres nationally and internationally. From 1976 MMM received a Sports Council annual grant in recognition that its teachers continued to bring dance exercise to both children and adults across a wide social, age, and ability range. In the late 1970s it was established in Canada, Switzerland, France, Germany, and Japan. Morris died at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, on 29 February 1980. Many of the avant-garde ideas which she put forward in the 1920s and 1930s have become part of the vocabulary of modern dance.<br>
