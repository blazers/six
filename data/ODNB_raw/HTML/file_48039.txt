<span class="headword">Bull,  Herbert Arthur</span>  (1854&#150;1928), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born at Harrow on 21 May 1854, the son of William John Bull (<i>d</i>. 1890), an assistant master at Harrow School, and his wife, Augusta Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall). Educated at Rugby School from 1867 to 1873, Bull entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1873, graduating with a pass degree in 1877. He represented Cambridge against Oxford at rugby football, tennis, and racquets. His first teaching post was as an assistant master at Wellington College, where he taught modern languages from 1880 to 1886. He left Wellington to set up, in partnership with his brother, Reginald Alfred Bull (<i>b</i>. 1857), a private preparatory school at Westgate-on-Sea, which they named Wellington House. They started with only one boy, but by 1896 there were over fifty; many proceeded with scholarships to Wellington College, with which Bull maintained close ties. Reginald Bull set up a preparatory school (St Andrew's, Southborough, Kent) on his own account in 1890, leaving Herbert as sole headmaster at Wellington House until his retirement in 1920. Bull ran the school with the help of his wife, Elinor, daughter of Alfred Willett, a surgeon, whom he married in 1889. Wellington House closed in 1970.<br>
<br>Ordained in 1884, Bull was deeply religious, and built a chapel for the school. Simple and honest in his approach to the education of boys, he could also be a frequent user of the cane. A lifelong enthusiast for sport, he was one of the original members of the Hockey Association.<br>
<br>Bull was a leading light in the formation of the Association of Preparatory Schools (APS) in 1892, seeing the importance of having a public body to bring the heads of public and preparatory schools together. He was twice elected chairman (1899 and 1910). Holding high ideals about the teaching of the young, he saw the APS members as a band of brothers dedicated to the early teaching of the leaders of the nation. He could, however, be impatient with those who did not share his views. His last appearance at the APS conference was in 1917, when he defended the retention of the scripture paper in the common entrance examination.<br>
<br>After his retirement Bull was active in local government and became chairman of Westgate-on-Sea urban district council. He was appointed rural dean of Westbere, Thanet, in 1917. He died at his home, Idene Place, Benenden, Kent, on 10 August 1928.<br>
