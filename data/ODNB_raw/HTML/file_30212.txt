<span class="headword">Yelverton,  Barry</span>, first Viscount Avonmore  (1736&#150;1805), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was born on 28 May 1736, the son and heir of Francis Yelverton (1705&#150;1746) of Blackwater, co. Cork, and Elizabeth Barry (<i>d</i>. 1804) of Kilbrin, in the same county. Though, as he later made clear, &#145;of an English family by the maternal and paternal lines&#146;  (O'Connell, 121), Yelverton's family circumstances were straitened. Having been educated by the Revd Charles Egan at Charleville School he obtained a sizarship in 1753 and a scholarship two years later that allowed him to attend Trinity College, Dublin, whence he graduated BA in 1757. Obliged to embrace teaching for some years after his graduation, during which time he acted as usher to Dr Andrew Buck, who ran the well-known Hibernian Academy in North King Street, Dublin, Yelverton's object was to become a lawyer. He entered the Middle Temple in 1759 and took an LLB at Trinity College in 1761. His marriage in July of that year, to Mary Nugent (1733&#150;1802) of Clonlost, co. Westmeath, temporarily eased his financial situation and allowed him to study for the Irish bar, to which he was called in 1764. His rise to eminence in the law was steady rather than meteoric but his knowledge and ability attracted the notice of the then lord chancellor, James Hewitt, first Viscount Lifford, who promoted his appointment as king's counsel in 1772. His emergence as one of the leading lawyers of the day was confirmed when an LLD was conferred on him in 1774.<br>
<br>Like many of his contemporaries who achieved &#145;eminence&#146;  (Hunt, 53) in the law Yelverton was possessed of political ambitions; he was provided with an opportunity to realize them when he was brought into the Irish parliament for the borough of Donegal by Arthur Saunders Gore, second earl of Arran, in 1774. At the general election two years later Arthur Chichester, fifth earl of Donegal, oversaw his return for the constituency of Carrickfergus. Despite this dependence on patrons Yelverton's political views drew him towards the patriot opposition and he quickly established himself as one of the most able and outspoken voices in the House of Commons with a series of pointed interventions that challenged the administration's policy with respect to the war in the American colonies. Yelverton's own position, as enunciated on 25 November 1775, was that &#145;the resistance of the Americans is not rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, 28 Nov 1775), and his pertinacious criticism of the policy of sending troops on the Irish army establishment to fight in America and of the imposition of an embargo on Ireland's freedom to trade as &#145;arbitrary, illegal and partial&#146;  (ibid., 24 Feb 1776) earned him popular applause. He consolidated his reputation as one of the foremost liberal voices of the moment by supporting, in 1778, the repeal of a substantial number of penal laws on the grounds that they were &#145;disgraceful to humanity&#146;  (ibid., 20 June 1778), and, in 1782, by endorsing Henry Grattan's suggestion that further concessions to Catholics would enable Ireland &#145;to assume the dignity of a nation, and not continue &hellip; an insignificant colony&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span>, 1.287).<br>
<br>Meanwhile in his capacity as founder of the influential patriot body, the Order of St Patrick (better known by its colloquial name the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96301', "Monks of the Screw")</script>), and as advocate of the tactic of pressurizing the British government by approving a six-month rather than a two-year money bill, Yelverton made an important contribution to the successful campaign in the winter of 1779&#150;80 to secure the removal of the mercantilist restrictions that bound Ireland's freedom to trade. Encouraged, by the popular applause showered on him as a result, to pursue the dilution of the restrictions that bound the Irish parliament's capacity to make law, Yelverton was as active as Henry Grattan in catapulting the matter of legislative independence to the top of the political agenda in the spring of 1780. However, personal as well as strategic calculations ensured that he was not long to sustain this independent role. Though he was one of the country's leading advocates by the early 1780s, the needs of his family, combined with the calculation that constitutional reform was more likely with the support of the Irish administration, caused him to gravitate towards Dublin Castle in the winter of 1781&#150;2. One effect of this was to expose a chasm within the ranks of the patriots between the essentially moderate route to legislative independence identified by Yelverton and the more uncompromising way promoted by Henry Flood. Yelverton was sometimes bested in argument by Flood but he had the satisfaction of knowing that it was his proposal, commonly known as Yelverton's act, for modifying Poynings' law, that wrought one of the main legal changes that gave the Irish parliament legislative independence in 1782.<br>
<br>Arising out of his preparedness to work with the Irish administration Yelverton was appointed attorney-general by the lord lieutenant, William Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, in July 1782. This was a key position in the Irish administration, since the attorney-general was traditionally one of its leaders in the Commons. The expectation was that Yelverton would employ his acknowledged oratorical prowess and &#145;strong understanding&#146;  (Sayles, 236) to good effect. However, he was also possessed of &#145;little knowledge of the world&#146;  (ibid.), which proved a major impediment. Thus while he confidently repulsed the attempt by the volunteers to bring about the reform of the representation in November 1783, on the grounds that it was &#145;inconsistent with the freedom of debate&#146; for the legislature to receive a bill originating with an armed assembly  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register</span>, 2.226&#150;7), his general management of men and matters left much to be desired, and he was induced to vacate the attorney-generalship for the position of chief baron of the Irish court of exchequer in December 1783.<br>
<br>Yelverton's elevation to the judicial bench greatly reduced his involvement in, but did not cause him to forsake, the world of politics. He remained a committed whig, and a combination of loyalty and political principle caused him, albeit with some reservations, to support whig efforts to secure an unlimited regency for George, prince of Wales. It was conjectured then that, had this ensued, he would have become lord chancellor. His most important judicial decision in this period came in 1792&#150;3 in the case of <i>Maingay v. Gahan</i>, when he ruled unlawful the seizure of a cargo of brandy and wine, valued at &pound;1600, from a ship at Bandon, co. Cork, because of the procedures employed. His ruling, however, was overturned by the court of exchequer chamber, consisting of John FitzGibbon, Viscount Fitzgibbon, and later earl of Clare, lord chancellor; John Scott, earl of Clonmell, chief justice of the king's bench; and Hugh Carleton, Baron Carleton, chief justice of common pleas.<br>
<br>When in 1794 William Wentworth Fitzwilliam, fourth Earl Fitzwilliam, was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, Yelverton was again tipped for the seals but he had to make do with a belated elevation to the peerage as Baron Avonmore in June 1795. His firm stand against sedition in the late 1790s, including his role as presiding judge at the trial of William Orr at Carrickfergus in 1797, helped to dispel the shadow of suspicion that had limited his prospects until then. His support for the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> dispelled this still further, for, though he was disappointing when entrusted with business in the House of Lords, he was created Viscount Avonmore in December 1800, despite the opposition of Portland, and he was an unsuccessful aspirant for the seals on the death of Clare in 1802. He died at his home, Fortfield, Rathfarnham, co. Dublin, on 19 August 1805, having served as lord chief baron for just over a quarter of a century, and was buried at Rathfarnham.<br>
<br>Avonmore was not regarded as a great judge, mainly because of his willingness to rush to judgment, but he did endeavour with some success to ensure that justice was imparted fairly. The preparedness of so many to speak well of him and to estimate his talents highly during his lifetime serves as ample testament to the fact that he was a man of considerable ability who did well in life both for himself and for the three sons and one daughter who survived him.<br>
