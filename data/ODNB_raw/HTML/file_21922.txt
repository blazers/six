<span class="headword">Percy,  Alan</span>  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1560), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21935/', "Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland (c.1449&#150;1489)")</script>, and Maud (<i>d</i>. in or before 1485), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13053/', "William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke")</script>. He was ordained by 1 May 1513 when he received the prebend of Dunnington, York Minster, which he resigned before 1 November 1517, and on 6 May 1515 was presented to the rectory of St Anne, Aldersgate, in London, which he held until 1518. Percy was formally admitted as master of St John's College, Cambridge, on 29 July 1516, at the public opening of the college; but he received at John Fisher's behest a half-yearly instalment paid for the six months ending at Michaelmas 1516, which suggests that he took office earlier in the year. He was granted a university grace to incept in arts, graduating MA in 1518. During Percy's short mastership he took an active part in the process of annexing Ospringe Hospital, Kent, to St John's. His expenses between August 1516 and February 1517 included riding to supervise lands, reparations, and sound administration there, and for business in London.<br>
<br>Percy resigned his mastership by an undated document in the autumn of 1518: on 1 November according to Thomas Baker. On 21 November he was granted an annual pension of &pound;10 and use of the master's low parlour and two inner chambers at St John's. This provision reflected his noble status as brother of the earl of Northumberland, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21936/', "Henry Algernon Percy")</script>, to which Fisher had referred in the college statutes of 1516 when awarding him the large salary of &pound;20 as master. This was actually no more than had been paid to Robert Shorton, but Shorton had supervised the building of the college. In a letter of 6 April (year uncertain), Nicholas Daryngton, fellow of St John's, reported to the master that he had sent Percy &pound;5 which the latter had begged for several times, being in need. Percy resigned his pension and room rights on 4 February 1521, the king having on 2 April 1520 granted him a house and garden at Stepney, Middlesex.<br>
<br>On 25 October 1521 Percy became rector of St Mary-at-Hill, London, and in 1526 he was presented by the earl of Rochford to the rectory of Mulbarton-cum-Keningham, Norfolk. He became in 1539 warden of the College of the Holy Trinity at Arundel, Sussex, which he and two fellows surrendered to the king on 12 December 1545. In June 1527 he acted as a trustee for the estate of his brother the earl of Northumberland who had died on 19 May. In 1530 it appears that he owed Cardinal Wolsey's estate &pound;9 for expediting a suit for the union of certain unspecified parishes. In 1547 he was presented by the dean and chapter of St Paul's, London, to the vicarage of Kensworth, Hertfordshire. Percy was a benefactor to Norwich, having given it a messuage in 1534, and his portrait dated 1549 hangs in the guildhall there. The duke of Norfolk presented him to the rectory of Earsham, Norfolk, in 1558. Percy died before 7 May in 1560 and is alleged to have been buried in St John's College chapel, but the site of his tomb has not been identified.<br>
