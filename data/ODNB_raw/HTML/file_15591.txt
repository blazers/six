<span class="headword">King,  Richard John</span>  (1818&#150;1879), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, eldest son of Richard King (<i>d</i>. 1829) and his wife, Mary Grace Windeatt (1798&#150;1884), was born on 18 January 1818 at Montpelier, Pennycross, a chapelry attached to St Andrew, Plymouth. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 17 November 1836, and graduated BA in 1841. On his father's death he inherited considerable property, including the estate of Bigadon in Buckfastleigh, Devon, where he lived until 1854. However, the lands were heavily mortgaged, and in that year King was forced by financial pressures to sell them, as well as his father's collection of pictures and the magnificent library which he himself had built up. He then moved to The Limes, Crediton, where he supported himself by writing. King's literary career had started early. While still an undergraduate, he printed in 1840, for private distribution, thirty-three copies of two lectures read before the Essay Society of Exeter College. Their subjects were &#145;The supernatural beings of the Middle Ages&#146; and &#145;The origin of the romance literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries&#146;. To the <span class="italic">Oxford Essays</span> for 1856 he contributed a paper on &#145;Carlovingian romance&#146;. His first separate publication was <span class="italic">Selections from Early Ballad Poetry</span> (1842), with many notes and preliminary observations. In 1850 he published an anonymous novel entitled <span class="italic">Anschar: a Story of the North</span>: set in the viking period, it met with no great success. In 1856 he published the first two chapters of an intended history of Devon, under the title of <span class="italic">The Forest of Dartmoor and its Borders: an Historical Sketch</span>.<br>
<br>King was elected a member of the Devonshire Association in 1874, and served as president in 1875, when his address dealt with the early history of the county. He contributed several papers to the association's <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, and at the time of his death was on no fewer than eight of its special committees. With several other members he was involved in translating and editing the <span class="italic">Devonshire Domesday</span>.<br>
<br>King was a large contributor to Murray's series of handbooks to the English counties. He prepared handbooks on Kent and Sussex (1858), on Surrey and Hampshire and the Isle of Wight (1858), and on Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Cambridgeshire (1870). He also worked on Yorkshire (1866&#150;8), Northamptonshire (1872&#150;7), Warwickshire and Hertfordshire (1872&#150;5), and the fifth and later editions of Devon and Cornwall. He was the leading writer in the same publisher's series of <span class="roman">Handbooks to the Cathedrals of England</span> (1861&#150;9) and in the subsequent volume on the <span class="italic">Cathedrals of Wales</span> (1873). Sections of both the county and cathedral handbooks were also issued separately. For many years King was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. A selection from his articles, including his early paper on &#145;Carlovingian romance&#146;, was published in 1874 under the title of <span class="italic">Sketches and Studies</span>. King also frequently wrote for <span class="italic">The Academy</span> and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, and contributed to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. The first five parts of <span class="italic">Our Own Country</span> (1878&#150;83) were written by him for Cassel &amp; Co., and he assisted in the compilation of <span class="italic">Picturesque Europe</span> (1876&#150;9). His paper on &#145;Bristol Cathedral&#146; appeared in volume 3 of the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society</span>, and a letter by him, &#145;On the family and parentage of Judhael de Totnais&#146;, is in W. Cotton's <span class="italic">A Graphic and Historical Sketch of the Antiquities of Totnes</span> (1850).<br>
<br>King died at his home, The Limes, Crediton, on 10 February 1879, and was buried in Crediton churchyard. The stained-glass east window of the lady chapel was dedicated to his memory. The east window and four smaller windows in Buckfastleigh church were given by him while he was living at Bigadon.<br>
