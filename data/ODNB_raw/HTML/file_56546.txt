<span class="headword">Watt,  Christian</span>  (1833&#150;1923), <span class="occ">fisherwoman and memoirist</span>, was born on 24 February 1833 at 72 Broadsea, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the seventh of the eight children of James Watt (1787&#150;1868), fisherman, and his wife, Helen Noble (1788&#150;1860). Her family was distantly related to the Saltouns, clan chiefs of the Frasers.<br>
<br>Christian Watt grew up in a tradition of nationalism, Jacobitism, and anti-Presbyterianism, and was greatly influenced by her maternal grandmother, Helen. Her family were poor and lived in a small house at Broadsea. She attended Broadsea School, and from the age of eight also helped the family with the work of the fishing. At the age of eight and a half, Christian worked as a domestic servant. In 1843 she became a maid to Lady Saltoun, and her diligence was rewarded with a dictionary. From 1844 onwards she accompanied the Broadsea fishermen on their summer expedition to the west coast to gut and cook herring. She recounts that subsequently she personally confronted Lord MacDonald of Sleat about his part in the clearances. She also described seeing Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in royal Deeside.<br>
<br>In 1849 the duchess of Leeds arranged for Watt to work as a domestic servant in London, where she stayed for several months. In 1856 she travelled to America in order to receive money from the legacy of her recently deceased brother. She obtained a post as a tablemaid with a wealthy American family and spent time exploring New York. Eight months later she returned home and, on 2 December 1858 at Broadsea, she married James Sim (1831&#150;1877), a fisherman. They had ten children. In 1874 her son Peter was drowned at sea, and Watt dated the onset of her mental breakdown from this point. Another son, Joseph, died of tetanus in 1876, and in the following year her husband was also drowned. Shortly afterwards, she lost another son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1877 Watt was admitted to the Royal Aberdeen Asylum. On returning home the following month, she was shunned by the local population and it proved impossible to maintain a livelihood. She applied to emigrate to America but was turned down because of her history of insanity. She was readmitted to the asylum twice again. The last occasion, in 1879, proved permanent and she spent her remaining forty-four years there. The case-notes state that she suffered from &#145;mania&#146; with &#145;religious delusions&#146;. A tall, attractive woman of forthright opinions, in later years she was also said to have had an eccentric dress-sense.<br>
<br>During her stay in the asylum, she was encouraged to write down her memoirs by two fellow patients. The asylum authorities ruled that all inmate writing was done in pencil, as there was a concern that patients might drink the ink or use the quills to injure themselves. Her manuscript is written in a confident, legible hand and the tone is forthright and opinionated. Watt often quotes from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> but her prose is also enlivened by the use of local dialect. In addition to relating her own experiences as a long-term mental patient and giving a positive account of her care, the memoir gives a vivid insight into the social history of Watt's time, encompassing as it did the plight of the fishing industry and the effects of the highland clearances.<br>
<br>Christian Watt died on 20 June 1923 in the Aberdeen asylum. The cause of death was chronic myocarditis and arteriosclerosis. She was buried at Kirkton cemetery, Fraserburgh. Watt's story was made known to the wider world by the publication of <span class="italic">The Christian Watt Papers</span> in 1983, which represented an edited version of her handwritten autobiography, which is now the property of her family. The difficulty for any appraisal of the life of Christian Watt is that surviving knowledge of her is almost entirely based on her own account. Further, this appears to have been composed in her last years, making it susceptible to distortion and inaccuracy. Nevertheless, the published version aroused some interest and inspired a play, <span class="italic">Precarious Living</span> (1985), and a drama documentary, both of which somewhat romanticized her plight.<br>
