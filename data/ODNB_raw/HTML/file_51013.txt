<span class="headword">Lekeux,  Peter</span>  (1648&#150;1723), <span class="occ">master weaver</span>, was born in Canterbury, Kent, the third son of John Lekeux, weaver, and Antoine Le Quien. The Lekeux were a well-established family of weavers, who had first gone to Canterbury as Huguenot refugees in the late sixteenth century. Peter served his apprenticeship in Canterbury, then moved to London, being admitted to the Weavers' Company in 1675. He married Marie (<i>d</i>. 1723), the daughter of Pierre Marescaux (Peter Marescoe), on 7 August 1681. As Marescaux was one of the leading master weavers in the rapidly expanding London silk industry, and a man of some wealth, it was an influential alliance for Lekeux's career, and on Marescaux's death in 1710 he inherited considerable property and one third of his estate.<br>
<br>Peter Lekeux was the first of three master weavers of the same name to play a leading role in the Weavers' Company, making the Lekeux family among the most important in the English silk industry for nearly 100 years. In 1692 he was a founder member of the Royal Lustring Company, a joint-stock company set up to weave lustrings, glazed silks whose production and trade was previously a French monopoly. Its success was such that in 1695 legislation was proposed seeking to break the monopoly the company had rapidly established, Lekeux petitioning the House of Lords against the bill. He was active, too, on behalf of the Weavers' Company, helping to formulate its policy and standing as its spokesman in giving parliamentary evidence. A man of wide experience both of the London industry and overseas trade, he was as confident in presenting a detailed memorandum to the House of Lords on trade with Italy and Portugal as he was in explaining to the commissioners for trades and plantations what kinds of textiles were made in the different regions of England. His evidence was particularly significant during the anti-calico campaign of 1719&#150;20, an episode of vigorous lobbying by members of the silk and woollen industries which helped to secure legislation prohibiting the sale, use, and wear of printed calico.<br>
<br>Peter Lekeux bore the title of colonel, indicating his rank between 1710 and 1722 in the Tower Hamlets regiment of the London trained bands (in which he had served as captain from 1691 to 1697, and major from 1697 to 1708). He also served as a justice of the peace, commissioner of sewers, and commissioner for land tax in the county of Middlesex. At his death in Stepney, Middlesex, in 1723 he was able to leave substantial property to his sons and grandsons, but none appears to have entered the silk trade.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51014"></a><span class="headword">Peter Lekeux</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1684, <em>d.</em> 1743), one of the executors of Lekeux's will, was his nephew; he was baptized on 17 February 1684 at the French church, Threadneedle Street, London, the son of his elder brother John (<i>b</i>. 1647) and Susannah Didier (<i>d</i>. 1719). He had been apprenticed as a silk weaver in 1703 at the late age of nineteen, made free in January 1712, and later the same year went on to the livery of the Weavers' Company. This was the start of a long association which saw him become an upper warden of the company in 1728 and be elected to the court of assistants, the governing body, in 1734. His activity on company business included fighting legislation against the wearing of materials containing precious metal, the last attempt at sumptuary legislation in England, shortly before his death in London on 20 June 1743. He bore the rank of captain in the London trained bands. Peter Lekeux had married Sarah Bloodworth on 29 July 1712 and of their four children he left a sum to his son Peter &#145;in consideration of the care and management of his father's business&#146;  (will, fol. 78).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51015"></a><span class="headword">Peter Lekeux</span>  (1716&#150;1768) had been apprenticed to his father in February 1730. He was not made free until 1745, perhaps because he had been working exclusively for his father, but joined the livery of the Weavers' Company immediately, and rose in its ranks to reach the highest office, upper bailiff, in July 1764. Also a distinguished master weaver in the London silk industry, living and working throughout his life in or close to Spitalfields, he left all his property at his death in London on 9 December 1768 to his wife, probably called Mary, naming no children or partners to continue his business.<br>
