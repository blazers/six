<span class="headword">Littleton <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Walhouse]</span>,  Edward John</span>, first Baron Hatherton  (1791&#150;1863), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 18 March 1791; he was the only son of Moreton Walhouse of Hatherton in the parish of Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, and his wife, Anne Cracroft, daughter of Abraham Portal, goldsmith and dramatist. He entered Rugby School at midsummer 1806, and matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 27 January 1809, and was created a DCL on 18 June 1817. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 17 November 1810, but took his name off the books on 6 November 1812. In compliance with the will of his great-uncle, Sir Edward Littleton, bt (a lineal descendant of Sir Thomas Littleton KB, author of the <span class="italic">Treatise of Tenures</span>), he assumed the surname of Littleton in lieu of Walhouse on 23 July 1812, and on attaining the age of twenty-four succeeded to the family estates in Worcestershire and Staffordshire and to &pound;18,000 p.a. At a by-election in June 1812, occasioned by his great-uncle's death in the previous month, he was returned unopposed as MP for Staffordshire, holding the seat until 1832. He applied for the baronetcy but decided the request compromised his political independence, and withdrew it.<br>
<br>On 21 December 1812 Littleton joined the Canningite camp by marrying Hyacinthe Mary (1789?&#150;1849), illegitimate daughter of Richard, first Marquess Wellesley, and Hyacinthe Gabrielle, daughter of Pierre Roland, a Frenchman. After &#145;early prepossessions&#146; of toryism, his &#145;feelings were with the more liberal party&#146; and he supported Catholic emancipation; however, he supported the property tax in 1816. He seconded Manners Sutton's nomination for the speakership on 2 June 1817 and supported Mackintosh's motion for a select committee on the criminal laws on 2 March 1819, serving on the subsequent committee. He sat on many other committees (finance, Windsor's establishment, the Bank of England). From 1817 until 1862 he kept a journal which has been much used by historians, and was partly published in A. Aspinall's edition of extracts from three such works (1952). He supported radical poor-law reform. On 22 April 1825 he introduced his <span class="roman">Elective Franchise in Ireland Bill</span>, a buttress to Burdett's <span class="roman">Roman Catholic Relief Bill</span>; both bills failed. It reflected his increasing whiggery, which, after the death of Canning in 1827, became overt. In 1828 he supported parliamentary reform; in 1830 he represented the views of Huskissonites to the tory leadership, pressing for reform; in 1831 the whig government appointed him to superintend and report on the boundary commissioners.<br>
<br>In 1832 Littleton was elected unopposed for South Staffordshire. Annoyed by the cabinet's decision to continue Manners Sutton as speaker, the radicals nominated Littleton (proposed by Joseph Hume, seconded by Daniel O'Connell); but he declared himself &#145;unwilling&#146; and the motion was lost. In May 1833 he was appointed chief secretary to Ireland and was re-elected by 439 votes to 6 for South Staffordshire (his only contested election); in June he was sworn of the privy council. His position as chief secretary was, to say the least, awkward. The Liberal section of the cabinet pressed for a more radical policy towards the Irish church and for an accommodation with O'Connell. Littleton got on good terms with O'Connell and used the Irish secret service funds to secure a good press in Ireland. But O'Connell took him by surprise on 13 February 1834 by introducing a motion for a select committee on Baron Smith. Littleton accepted O'Connell's motion which was passed but was then reversed, the debate seriously weakening the government. On 20 February Littleton carried a motion for the commutation of existing tithes into a land tax and on 2 May introduced his <span class="roman">Tithe Bill</span>. On 6 May Russell, without consultation, announced that Irish church revenues were unnecessarily large and that the surplus should be appropriated. The crisis over appropriation, as a result of which Stanley and Graham resigned, merged with that over coercion a month later, when Lord Wellesley (the lord lieutenant and Littleton's father-in-law), who had hitherto advised renewal of the meetings' clauses, changed his advice in response to an appeal from Littleton, who recommended their abandonment on 21 June. Littleton, who had written to Wellesley at Brougham's instigation, then saw O'Connell and gave him the strong but erroneous impression that the Liberals in cabinet had carried the day. When it was clear that Grey had in fact overruled the Liberals, O'Connell revealed to the Commons his private dealings with Littleton, who in turn admitted &#145;a gross indiscretion&#146;. The episode led to the resignations of Grey and Althorp and the premiership of Melbourne. Littleton's tenure of the chief secretaryship was thus the occasion for a string of resignations which affected British politics for a generation. These were not altogether Littleton's fault, but his amiable character did not equip him to bring a tense situation under control. On 16 July 1834, recognizing that he had been &#145;the main cause of Lord Grey's resignation&#146;, Littleton offered his resignation to Melbourne but agreed to stay on when Althrop, who had resigned over the same matter, withdrew his resignation. He passed his <span class="roman">Coercion Bill</span> (the court-martial and meetings' clauses being omitted) but his <span class="roman">Tithe Bill</span> was rejected by the Lords. He resigned on Melbourne's dismissal in November 1834.<br>
<br>Littleton was again unopposed in South Staffordshire in January 1835, but his hopes of the speakership were denied by the government's support for Abercromby. He was never appointed to any other ministerial office. He was created Baron Hatherton of Hatherton on 11 May 1835 and took his seat in the Lords on 1 June. In his maiden speech the next day he caused a short but excited discussion by applying the word &#145;sectarian&#146; to the established church in Ireland  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 28, 1835, 355&#150;8). He supported the repeal of the corn laws in 1846 and was appointed lord lieutenant of Staffordshire on 8 June 1854.<br>
<br>Hatherton's first wife died on 4 January 1849, aged fifty-nine, leaving him with one son, Edward Richard, who succeeded to the title, and three daughters. On 11 February 1852 he married Caroline Anne, widow of Edward Davies Davenport of Capesthorne, Macclesfield, and daughter of Richard Hurt of Wirksworth, Derbyshire; they had no children and she died aged eighty-eight at Worthing on 16 May 1897.<br>
<br>Hatherton spoke for the last time in the Lords on 23 May 1862. He died on 4 May 1863 at his seat, Teddesley, near Penkridge, Staffordshire (demolished in 1954); he was buried in Penkridge church on 12 May. Hatherton was a man of moderate abilities and little tact who at the vital moment of his career found himself the superficial cause of a split in the whig party, which was in fact of long-standing causation, though he compounded it by an over-estimation of his capacity to manage the strong personalities around him; when warned against O'Connell he is reported to have said: &#145;Oh! leave me to manage Dan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>). He had not the will or the ability to recover from the blame consequently attached to him.<br>
