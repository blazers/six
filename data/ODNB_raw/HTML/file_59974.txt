<span class="headword">Perkins,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777, <em>d.</em> 1855), <span class="occ">book collector and brewer</span>, was baptized on 2 January 1777 at St Swithin London Stone, London, the son of John Perkins (1729/30&#150;1812) and his wife, Amelia, widow of Timothy Bevan. John Perkins was the chief clerk of the Anchor Brewery in Southwark, which he was credited with having saved from demolition during the Gordon riots of 1780 by a judicious offer of porter to an angry mob. The following year, in partnership with his wife's Quaker relatives David Barclay, Robert Barclay, and Sylvanus Bevan, he bought the business for some &pound;135,000. It was of this sale that Dr Johnson commented, &#145;we are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice&#146;  (Cockes and Cook, 16). Johnson's friend Hester Thrale (later Piozzi), the wife of the brewery's late owner, Henry Thrale, gave assistance to Perkins with the purchase, and in 1790 she arranged for the celebrated Samuel Parr to tutor two of Perkins's sons&#151;almost certainly Henry and his younger brother <a name="cosubject_59974"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Perkins</span>  (1780&#150;1860)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized on 29 September 1780 at St Swithin London Stone. With apparent relish at taking down the <i>arrivistes</i>, Hester Thrale noted that they were &#145;sad mean boys &hellip; [their mother] fancied they would be scholars, but they prov'd poor creatures it seems&#146;  (Pudney, 73). Frederick was apprenticed at the brewery in February 1796, and received half of his father's quarter share in the concern by an indenture of September 1808; Henry received the other moiety, probably at the same time. Neither son appears to have taken a particularly forward role in the firm's management, though both served a term as master of the Brewers' Company&#151;Henry in 1817 and Frederick in 1823.<br>
<br>The brewery continued to prosper and, as if in defiance of Hester Thrale's remark, the Perkins brothers spent much of their wealth on the accumulation of rare and valuable books. Henry, who was a fellow of the Linnean, Geological, and Horticultural societies, began collecting in the early 1820s, when he was resident at Springfield, near Tooting, Surrey; later, about 1836, he moved to Hanworth Park, Middlesex. His agents were John and Arthur Arch of 61 Cornhill, London, and his most significant bulk purchase was of items from the collection of John &#145;Dog&#146; Dent (1750&#150;1826). Perkins's library was not notably extensive, but it included two copies of the Gutenberg <span class="roman">Bible</span> (one paper, one vellum); a first edition of the Latin <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1462); a Coverdale <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1835); the first four Shakespeare folios; several works from the press of Caxton; and some fine illuminated manuscripts, among them John Lydgate's <span class="italic">Sege of Troy</span> (<i>c</i>.1425). Perkins had married Susannah Latham on 2 April 1803; they had one son and three daughters, and she apparently predeceased him. He died at Dover on 15 April 1855, whereupon his eighth share in the brewery and his books passed to his son, Algernon (<i>bap</i>. 20 December 1808). After the latter's death in 1870, the library was dispersed; the 865 lots in the sale (held on 3&#150;6 June 1873) raised nearly &pound;25,000, the largest amount hitherto realized for a collection of its size. One commentator, writing in 1892, ventured that it was &#145;in certain respects the most valuable ever brought together&#146;  (Kearney).<br>
<br>Frederick Perkins's collection was larger but less distinguished: its chief ornaments were the first four Shakespeare folio editions (not to be outdone by his brother), and a number of separate plays in quarto, including six first editions. A fifteenth-century copy of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> and several illuminated manuscripts also featured. With his wife, also named Susannah, whom he had married before February 1803, he had at least one son, Frederick Oswald Perkins (<i>bap</i>. 8 May 1804), who succeeded to his interest in the brewery. Perkins died at his residence at Chipstead Place, Kent, on 10 October 1860; the subsequent book sale of 2086 lots, held on 10 July 1889, raised &pound;8222 7<i>s</i>.<br>
