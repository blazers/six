<span class="headword">Ward, Sir  Henry George</span>  (1797&#150;1860), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was born on 27 February 1797 in London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28703/', "Robert Plumer Ward (1765&#150;1846)")</script>, novelist and politician, afterwards of Gilston Park, Hertfordshire, and his first wife, Catherine Julia (1772&#150;1821), daughter of Christopher Thompson Maling of West Herrington, co. Durham. Educated at Harrow School and sent abroad to learn languages, Ward entered the diplomatic service in 1816 as attach&eacute; in Sweden. Transferred to The Hague in 1818 and to Spain in 1819, he was joint commissioner in Mexico, 1823&#150;4, and charg&eacute; d'affairs, 1825&#150;7. He resigned in 1827 and returned to England with his wife, Emily Elizabeth (1798&#150;1882), second daughter of Sir John Swinburne, bt (1762&#150;1860), of Capheaton, whom he had married in 1824. In 1828 he published <span class="italic">Mexico in 1827</span>, a vivid and acutely observed account of the country.<br>
<br>Ward entered parliament as an advanced Liberal in January 1833, sitting first for the notoriously corrupt borough of St Albans and then from July 1837 until 1849 for Sheffield. After an unpromising beginning  (cf. <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 March, 3 and 5 April 1833), he became one of the acknowledged radical leaders. An able speaker, with a terse, vigorous style, he first came to notice by his motion, the first of many, on appropriating the surplus revenues of the Irish church (<span class="italic">Speech of H. G. Ward, esq., M.P. on moving certain resolutions respecting the Irish Church in the House of Commons &hellip; May 27, 1834</span>, published in 1834), which resulted, whether intentionally, as was widely assumed, or not, in completing the breach in the reform ministry. He was also prominent in such issues as free trade, the ballot, and franchise extension, and the establishment of the Reform Club and the Central Reform Association, using the <span class="italic">Weekly Chronicle</span>, of which he became political editor early in 1836 and proprietor in November 1838, to promote his views and combat Chartism. Keenly interested in colonial questions, he was a founder member of the Colonial Society of 1837, was active in the affairs of the South Australia Association and the New Zealand Company, and assiduous in promoting the colonization methods associated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield as a means for relieving social distress (as shown in <span class="italic">The debate of Mr. Ward's resolutions on colonization in the House of Commons, June 27, 1839, containing the speeches of H. G. Ward &hellip; Sir W. Molesworth, etc.</span>, 1839). In August 1839 he was offered, and refused, the secretaryship of the Board of Control by Lord Melbourne, although he now joined the ranks of the whig supporters, free trade and the ballot having been left as open questions. He accepted office in June 1846 as secretary to the Admiralty under Lord Auckland, whose defects in debate he ably supplied.<br>
<br>Ward's pecuniary embarrassments, meantime, exacerbated by feckless extravagance, were coming to an issue. His financial arrangements in Mexico had drawn forth several magisterial rebukes from the Foreign Office; he spent &pound;12,000 on his two elections for St Albans, the interest and insurance on which caused a considerable drain on family resources. His difficulties became the subject of unfavourable comment in the press (among others the <span class="italic">Sheffield Mercury</span>, 15 April 1843), and serious doubt of his being able to retain his seat. After severe retrenchment in his Hertfordshire estates, the management of which he had had since August 1838, his immediate problems were resolved by December 1843. Nevertheless, ill-judged railway speculation resulted in considerable losses during the panic of 1846, while his growing unpopularity in Sheffield in consequence of his identification with Russell's administration made offers of colonial governorships all the more attractive. His financial distress and the illness of his much loved wife thus obliged him to accept the proffered appointment of lord high commissioner in the Ionian Islands in April 1849.<br>
<br>Ward arrived at Corfu in June, to find himself in a difficult position. His predecessor, Lord Seaton, had proposed considerable reforms of the hitherto restrictive constitution, which Ward, after modifications, effected. But his suppression with no unsparing hand of an agrarian&#150;nationalist revolt in Cephalonia that autumn earned him the unenviable sobriquet of &#145;Dead or Alive Ward&#146;, and damned his reputation with his erstwhile radical associates, most notably Joseph Hume, who were vociferous in their attacks upon his proceedings. Meanwhile reform had aroused extravagant expectations of further concessions leading to the ultimate union of the islands with Greece. Ward at first tried conciliation and, that failing, governing by prorogations of the assembly and the use of administrative exile for the more intractable government opponents. Beyond this he was a markedly able governor, a considerable personality in the tortuous political and diplomatic affairs of the Levant during the early stages of the Crimean War, and active in checking Greek irredentist designs in Thessaly and Epirus.<br>
<br>In March 1855 Ward was appointed to the senior governorship of Ceylon, arriving in May. He toured the island extensively and, fortunate that his administration coincided with a period of economic growth, soon made his mark in developing communications, restoring and extending irrigation works, and encouraging the unofficial element in the legislative council. Identifying himself wholly with the interests of the island, he was active in the consolidation of the civil service, the amelioration of the conditions of seasonal migrants, and the abolition of polygamy. In June 1860 he was promoted to the governorship of Madras in succession to Sir Charles Trevelyan. He arrived there in July, succumbed to cholera and died at Government House on 2 August 1860. He was buried in the Anglican church of Fort St George, survived by his wife and ten children.<br>
<br>A tall, powerful man, with light brown hair, full round face and good-natured countenance, Ward was an expert swordsman and shot, and devoted to hunting. Possessed of considerable administrative talents, firmness of purpose, and a high sense of duty, he was an undeniably able man. As a politician, he earned the respect of men of all parties; and while events in the Ionian Islands afforded him little scope in the exercise of his talents beyond rebuffing the more extreme claims of Hellenic nationalism, his administration of Ceylon was adjudged as highly successful. He was appointed GCMG in June 1849. A statue commemorating his work in Ceylon was erected at Kandy by public subscription.<br>
