<span class="headword">Long,  Lislebone</span> <span class="st"> [created Sir Lislebone Long under the protectorate]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1659), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of William Long (<i>d</i>. 1645) of Stratton on the Fosse in Somerset, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of Thomas Loviband of Shorwell, Isle of Wight. Related to the Longs of Devizes and Trowbridge in Wiltshire, he was baptized at Beckington in Somerset in 1613 as Loveban, although he later changed his name to Lislebone. Educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 4 December 1629 and graduated BA on 1 February 1631, he was subsequently called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in February 1640. Held by contemporaries in the highest esteem as &#145;a person of great integrity in the profession of law&#146;  (Manning, 377) he was described by Whitelocke as &#145;a very sober, discrete gentleman and a good lawyer&#146;  (Whitelocke, 4.341). He and his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1691), daughter of John Mynne of Epsom, had several children, including his heir, George (1644&#150;1705).<br>
<br>In local affairs Long identified both before and during the civil wars with his Wiltshire relatives, who were outspoken critics of the king. Apparently a presbyterian in religion, he became an elder in parliament's presbyterian national church and a member of the committee established to administer the solemn league and covenant in Somerset (1644), and was later appointed to the parliamentary committee charged with settling the form of church government in England (1648). He eventually became a member of parliament's county committee in Somerset after its revival in 1645, following the ending of royalist occupation. However, although the committee was increasingly dominated by Colonel John Pyne's radical war party faction, Long himself had by then emerged as a moderate in politics.<br>
<br>Long's moderate stance was also demonstrated in parliament, following his election to the Long Parliament as a recruiter MP for Wells (1645&#150;53). He strongly opposed Pride's Purge (6 December 1648), though he was not secluded, as shown when he acted as a teller on a critical vote on the day following the purge. After a period of hesitation, during which he made occasional appearances, he eventually absented himself from the Commons in protest (25 December). However, although he played no part in the trial and execution of the king he became a conformist by taking his dissent (22 February 1649) and resuming his seat in the Rump Parliament. Thereafter, like many other conformists, he played an active role in the work of committees, exercising a moderating influence on government policies. He allied closely with a group of conservative lawyers (including Bulstrode Whitelocke, Roger Hill, and Edmund Prideaux) most of whom opposed proposals for reform of the legal system. Together they were entrusted with drafting much of the Rump's legislation and organizing the work of its committees.<br>
<br>Long also participated regularly in parliamentary debates. He served as MP for Wells in the first protectorate parliament (1654&#150;5); for Somerset in the second protectorate parliament (1656&#150;8); and again for Wells in Richard Cromwell's parliament (1659). He made intelligent contributions during sessions of the Cromwellian parliaments on points of law, precedent, and procedure, and spoke convincingly in the debates on James Nayler (5 December 1656), the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> (8 January 1657) and the powers of the &#145;other house&#146; (22 February 1658). He also submitted, as chairman of the committee charged with defining the powers of the lord protector, a paragraph to be inserted in &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146; (22 May 1657). After being elected recorder of London (1 June 1655) he was knighted by Oliver Cromwell (15 December 1656) and appointed treasurer of Lincoln's Inn, a master of requests, and a commissioner of treasons (all in 1656). Much respected within his local community, he was appointed JP for Somerset 1654&#150;9.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1659 Challoner Chute, the speaker of Richard Cromwell's parliament, suddenly became indisposed as a result of being &#145;tired out with the long debates and late sitting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.92). Whereupon, after Sir Arthur Hesilrige had proposed that Long should take the chair during the speaker's illness, Sir Lislebone was duly elected &#145;by general consent of the House&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 7.612). Although this was a tribute to the high regard in which he was held, his fame was sadly short-lived. One week later (16 March) Burton recorded in his diary that Long &#145;being very sick, could not attend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 4.419). He died later the same day and was buried at Stratton on the Fosse, leaving an estate which included a number of ecclesiastical and royalist lands purchased after confiscation by parliament.<br>
