<span class="headword">Oswald, Sir  John</span>  (1771&#150;1840), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of James Townsend Oswald, was born at Dunnikier, Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 2 October 1771. For some years (from about 1785) he was at the military school at Brienne, France, just after Napoleon had left. With Louis-Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, Napoleon's school companion and future secretary, Oswald contracted a lifelong friendship, and some of his holidays were spent in Paris. He thus acquired a command of the French language, which proved of great service to him in his profession, and a sympathy with the French, which was uncommon at that time. However, abhorrence of revolutionary principles, intensified by the loss of personal friends whom he had known in Paris in his youth, gave bias to his political views. He was appointed a second lieutenant in the 23rd foot (Royal Welch Fusiliers) on 1 February 1788, and first lieutenant in the 7th foot (Royal Fusiliers) on 29 January 1789. In June 1790 he embarked to join the Royal Fusiliers at Gibraltar, was appointed captain of an independent company on 24 January 1791, and on 23 March of that year became a captain in the 35th foot. While brigade major to Major-General John Leland, he resigned when the grenadier company of the 35th, which he commanded, was ordered to the West Indies. He served with the 2nd provisional battalion of grenadiers at the capture of Martinique, St Lucia, and Guadeloupe in 1794, and was afterwards in garrison at Port-au-Prince on San Domingo until his company was drafted and the officers and sergeants sent home to recruit. He became major in the 35th on 1 September 1795, lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 30 March 1797, and lieutenant-colonel in the army on 29 December 1798.<br>
<br>Oswald commanded the 35th during the expedition to The Helder in the Netherlands in 1799, until severely wounded at Crabbenham, near Bergen aan Zee, on 19 September. In 1800 he embarked with the two battalions of his regiment among the troops dispatched under Major-General Richard Pigot, and landed with them at Minorca. He subsequently took part in the blockade of Valletta and capture of Malta, remaining there in command of the regiment until the peace of Amiens, when he went home on leave. On the renewal of the war he rejoined the regiment at Malta, and became brevet colonel on 30 October 1805. With the 35th he joined the troops under Lieutenant-General Sir James Craig in Sicily, was appointed commander at Melazzo, and commanded the advance of Major-General Sir John Stuart's force at the landing in Calabria in June of that year. He commanded the 3rd brigade of the army at the battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, and three days later marched with it into Lower Calabria, where he captured Scylla Castle after a siege of twenty days. On his return to Sicily he received the local rank of brigadier-general. In February 1807 he went with Major-General Alexander Mackenzie Fraser to Egypt, where the two battalions of the 35th were the first troops to land. He commanded the troops sent against Alexandria, and attacked and captured the western lines, taking many guns and driving the Turks within the walls. Alexandria capitulated two days later. Oswald was then sent to Rosetta, where he came under repeated attack for fifteen days before being withdrawn in the face of vastly superior enemy forces. He remained in Alexandria until the expedition returned to Sicily, where he was appointed commandant of Augusta. In June 1808 his local rank was extended to the Mediterranean generally, and in October he was appointed to command a large body of troops collected at Melazzo. In 1809 he led the reserve in the expedition to the coast of Italy, which ended in the capture of the islands of Ischia and Procida; of the latter he became commandant. He went back to Sicily in July 1809, and in September was sent to the Ionian Islands with an expeditionary force, which seized Zante (Z&aacute;kynthos), Cephalonia, Ithaca, and Cerigo (Kithira).<br>
<br>In March 1810, recognizing the danger to the captured islands from the neighbouring French garrison in Santa Maura (Levkas), Oswald collected 2000 troops and landed there on 23 March. He drove the enemy behind their lines, personally leading the troops that stormed the strongest of the entrenchments, and secured the enemy's capitulation after eight days. He then administered the civil and military government of the captured islands. By his tact and judgement he confirmed the prepossessions of the Greeks in favour of British rule, and he also established advantageous relations with the neighbouring Turkish pashas. On 11 February 1811 Oswald was appointed colonel of the 1st Greek light infantry, consisting mostly of Greek brigands, who made very good soldiers. He left the administration of the Ionian Islands&#151;which he nominally governed until 1815&#151;to Richard Church and returned home to impress on the government their strategic importance. He was made a major-general on 4 June 1811 and appointed to command the western district. On 28 January 1812 he married Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1827), eldest daughter of the Revd Lord Charles Murray-Aynsley, son of John Murray, third duke of Atholl. James Townsend, their son, served as an army officer from 1839 to 1848.<br>
<br>Oswald joined the staff of the Peninsular army on 22 October 1812, during the retreat from Burgos. He was present with Wellington during rearguard cavalry actions on 23&#150;4 October, and on the 25th took command of the 5th division during the absence of Major-General James Leith. At the head of the division he had some sharp fighting at Villa Muriel and the passage of the River Carri&oacute;n, and remained in charge of it until it went into winter quarters on the banks of the River Douro, though on one occasion during the withdrawal he incurred Wellington's displeasure for varying his line of march without authority. When the army took the field in May 1813, Oswald commanded the 5th division in its difficult march through the north of Portugal and the Spanish provinces of Zamora, Le&oacute;n, and Palencia, as it drove the enemy back at Osma on 17 June, and, passing through a mountainous country previously considered impassable for troops with guns, joined Wellington at Vitoria on 20 June. He led the division at the battle of Vitoria on the 21st and the opening phase of the siege of San Sebastian. However, Leith resumed command of the division two days previous to the assault on San Sebastian on 31 August, Oswald reverting to a brigade until he was wounded on the 31st.<br>
<br>The death of an elder brother, and the failing health of his father, to whose estates he had become heir, now resulted in Oswald's recall to England. He received the thanks of parliament for his services at Vitoria and San Sebastian, and a gold medal with two clasps for Maida, Vitoria, and San Sebastian. He was made KCB on 4 June 1815. On the disbanding of the Greek light infantry he became colonel-commandant of one of the batteries of the rifle brigade, and on 9 October 1819 appointed colonel of the 35th, a post he retained until his death in 1840. He became a lieutenant-general on 12 August 1819 and a general on 10 January 1837, and was made GCB in 1824 and GCMG in 1838. In politics he was a staunch conservative and once, in the days before the first <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, unsuccessfully contested the county of Fife. In October 1829 he married Emily Jane, daughter of Lord Henry Murray and cousin of his first wife, Charlotte; she survived him.<br>
<br>In person Oswald was a tall, handsome, powerful man, over 6 feet in height, who used his weapons well in hand-to-hand combat, notably in the attack on Scylla Castle in 1806. He had strong literary tastes, was a good and ready public speaker, and was popular in society. Oswald died at his seat, Dunnikier, Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 8 June 1840.<br>
