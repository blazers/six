<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ryder,  Samuel</span>  (1858&#150;1936), <span class="occ">seed merchant and golf sponsor</span>, was born on 24 March 1858 at Walton-le-Dale near Preston in Lancashire, the first son of Samuel Ryder (1823/4&#150;1904), a gardener, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (1822/3&#150;1904), a dressmaker. He had three elder and two younger sisters and two younger brothers. He attended Owens College in Manchester to train as a teacher but, unlike his brother James, failed to complete the course because of ill health. Instead he joined a Manchester shipping firm and later his father's business, which had progressed from a market gardening enterprise to a combination of nurseryman, florist, and seed merchant. However, his father would not accept his ideas and he left to work for a London seed merchant.<br>
<br>On 20 November 1890 Ryder married Helen Mary, known as Nellie (1864&#150;1955), daughter of William Barnard, a tailor and draper. Two daughters, Marjorie and Joan, were born in 1893 and 1895. His daughters were infants when Ryder hit on the idea that was to make his fortune, the selling of packets of seeds through the post. In itself this was not new, as two companies already did so, but their prices varied between 1 and 10 shillings a packet. Ryder opted for a different market by advertising his seeds at only a penny a packet and set up his business in St Albans to take advantage of the town's railway connections. He began in a small way, keeping the seeds in a shed in the garden of his terraced house, where he prepared the catalogues and packets. Within a decade, after several moves to larger premises, over 2000 orders were being dealt with daily by almost a hundred staff. In 1922, with his brother James who had retired from teaching, he developed another successful venture, Heath and Heather, which specialized in herbs. Ryder became a wealthy man, owning property around St Albans, and making generous loans and donations to the local grammar school, his church, and several charities. In 1933 he brought his younger daughter Joan on to the board and after his death she took on the day-to-day management of the companies.<br>
<br>A committed Christian, Ryder became a junior Sunday school teacher in Sale when aged seventeen and in 1911 he was appointed president of the Mid-Hertfordshire Sunday School Union. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the project to build Trinity Congregational Church in St Albans, which opened in 1903, and of which he was a deacon. Also in that year, as a member of the Liberal Party, he was elected to the local council. He became mayor of St Albans in 1905 and continued to serve as a councillor until 1916.<br>
<br>Another period of ill health led indirectly to the creation of the Ryder cup, a trophy for a biennial international golf match. Aware that his doctor had advised open-air exercise, Ryder's friend and preacher at Trinity Congregational Church, Frank Walker, introduced him to golf in 1908. He became addicted, joined the local Verulam club, where he served on the greens committee for twenty years and became captain in 1911 after heading the subscription list for debentures to finance the expansion of the course. Two more years as captain followed in the late 1920s; both came after he made large donations to improve the club premises.<br>
<br>As a low handicap player himself Ryder had a high regard for professional golfers, and sympathized with the fact that they often had to forfeit their club pay when away playing in tournaments. Hence when Heath and Heather first sponsored a tournament in 1923 he ensured that all forty-eight competitors received at least &pound;5 for playing so that none went home out of pocket. Ryder was also a golfing patriot and in 1924 he sponsored a 72-hole four-ball match between two Americans and two British players, one of whom was Abe Mitchell (1887&#150;1947). In 1925 he appointed Mitchell as his personal golf tutor; as Ryder was now sixty-seven this was a sinecure designed to allow Mitchell time to practise and compete effectively against the Americans who were beginning to dominate the open championship. In June 1926 he funded an international match at Wentworth between British and American professionals before the latter played in the qualifying rounds for that year's open. This stimulated him to propose a regular event between representatives of the British and American professional golfers' associations, the two leading groups of golfers in the world. For this he offered the Ryder cup, a 100 guineas gold trophy with the figure of Abe Mitchell on top, which was won by the Americans at the first match, held at Worcester, Massachusetts, in June 1927. Ryder attended the first two matches held in Britain and presented his trophy to the winning British captains in April 1929 at Moortown and June 1933 at Southport.<br>
<br>By this time Ryder's health had deteriorated significantly. In an unavailing attempt to improve it he visited his elder daughter, who had migrated to Rhodesia. He died of pneumonia on 2 January 1936 at the Langham Hotel, Portland Place, London, the customary Christmas holiday residence of the Ryder family. He was buried at St Albans Trinity Congregational Church, St Albans, with his favourite golf club, his mashie, in his coffin. Although he left money for his household staff, his will did not include any charitable bequests because he had preferred to make them &#145;during my lifetime, as calculated to be of greater benefit to all concerned, than awaiting until after my death&#146;  (Murgatroyd and Booth, 23).<br>
