<span class="headword">Cunobelinus <span class="st"> [Cymbeline]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40), <span class="occ">king in southern Britain</span>, is the Cymbeline of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> (1578) and of Shakespeare's play. The father and predecessor of Cunobelinus, <a name="cosubject_62302"></a><span class="headword">Tasciovanus</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10)<span class="occ"></span>, had greatly extended the tribal kingdom of the Catuvellauni from its heartland north of the lower Thames eastward into what is now Essex and Suffolk and northward into modern Northamptonshire, thereby creating the largest of the Iron Age kingdoms in Britain. This expansion was chiefly at the expense of the Trinovantes of present-day Essex. On some of his coins Tasciovanus boasted the title <i>rigonos</i>, probably Celtic for <i>rex</i> (&#145;king&#146;), thus possibly indicating a will to exercise a power independent of Roman direction. On the death of Tasciovanus about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10, Cunobelinus succeeded him. The time was one in which Roman diplomatic and commercial influence in southern Britain was increasing. The area occupied by the Catuvellauni was well placed for the exploitation of new opportunities. It was surrounded by lesser powers and had access to the trade routes which led to and from Roman Gaul. The tribal territory also commanded vital raw materials, especially iron, and contained rich farmlands.<br>
<br>There are hints in the contemporary coinage of a power struggle among the rulers of south-eastern Britain early in the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. Cunobelinus emerged as the principal victor and he subsequently held sway for three decades as the dominant king of the southern British. Nothing is recorded of his personality, nor of the detailed events of his long reign. It is known that he had at least three sons, two of whom were to play the leading part in opposing the Roman invasion of Britain in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43. For the rest, his reign can only be reconstructed in outline from the evidence of coinage and archaeology. From his base in the Catuvellaunian heartland Cunobelinus appears first to have consolidated his hold over the Trinovantes. Shortly after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10 he was issuing coins bearing the mint mark CAM, for Camulodunum (Colchester), the principal centre of the Trinovantes. It is therefore clear that he had successfully annexed that people by then. He next turned his attention to the area south of the Thames. By <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 25 he had seized control of much of Cantium (Kent), while his brother Epaticcus extended his power over the Atrebates of the middle Thames valley. To the north, Cunobelinus pushed the bounds of his kingdom to the fenland margins, either directly or with the aid of sub-kings, so that his authority was effectively unchallenged in south-eastern Britain. Not inappropriately, the second-century Roman writer Suetonius referred to him as <i>Britannorum rex</i> (&#145;king of the Britons&#146;) and not merely as the ruler of a single tribe. Cunobelinus inscribed the title <i>rex</i> on some of his coins, possibly after recognition by the emperor Tiberius as an allied ruler of Rome. For a time he struck coins bearing designs which closely copy those of Roman issues. Some of these coins may well have been struck from dies engraved by Roman craftsmen who came to Cunobelinus's kingdom under a diplomatic arrangement.<br>
<br>During Cunobelinus's long reign of some thirty years relations between southern Britain and the Roman world were stable, probably reflecting mutually agreed arrangements designed to preserve the <i>status quo</i>. Tiberius had no desire to extend Roman dominion into Britain. Cunobelinus had nothing to gain by disturbing the peace. There was indeed much to lose, for Roman trade links with Britain developed strongly early in the first century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. Luxury imports of wine, fine metalwork, pottery, and other Roman goods were exchanged for a wide range of British products: corn, cattle, gold, silver, iron, slaves, and hounds, according to Strabo, writing about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 17. The prestige which this trade generated, allied with material benefits to British nobles, would not have gone unregarded by Cunobelinus. A clear sign of the British king's acceptance of a stable relationship with Rome is provided by the return to Gaul of several shiploads of Roman troops after they had been driven on to the British coast in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 16. The native centre of Camulodunum was greatly extended under Cunobelinus's rule, until a vast complex of about 7 square miles was bounded by massive earthen dykes. Elsewhere in the kingdom other centres began to assume urban form, as at Verulamium (St Albans) and Durovernum (Canterbury). In several respects Cunobelinus brought southern Britain close to the world of Rome. When he died, about <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 40, his mantle passed to two of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4601/', "Caratacus")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62305/', "Togodumnus")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48662/', "Roman Britain, British leaders in (act. 55 BC&#150;AD 84)")</script>], who were to adopt different policies towards the great power across the channel.<br>
