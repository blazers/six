<span class="headword">Palmer <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ambrose]</span>,  Eleanor</span>, Lady Palmer  (1718<span class="mult">x</span>20&#150;1818), <span class="occ">society beauty</span>, was probably born at Ambrose Hall, co. Dublin, the second daughter and coheir of Michael Ambrose, a wealthy brewer of co. Dublin, and his wife, the daughter of Richard Archbold. Little is known of her early life. It was recorded that she was &#145;gifted with exquisite beauty, and possessed of considerable mental acquirements&#146;  (Webb, 4). Philip Dormer Stanhope, fourth earl of Chesterfield, during the period of his viceroyalty in Ireland (1745&#150;7), was a great admirer of hers and was said to have called her &#145;the most dangerous papist in Ireland&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Baronetage</span>, 5.390). It was observed she was &#145;constantly in the viceroy's company and attended all state ceremonies&#146;  (Gerard, 21). Despite her constant appearance with Chesterfield it was noted that she &#145;guarded her reputation, keeping well within the limits of platonic friendship&#146;  (ibid., 22). It is difficult to know exactly how influential Palmer was on the politics of the period. Her beauty and wealth provided her with an entr&eacute;e into society and political contacts were made in this context.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1750, at St George's, Mayfair, Westminster, Eleanor married Roger Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1790?) of Castle Lackin, co. Mayo, and Kenure Park, co. Dublin. He was a member of parliament for Jamestown from 1761 to 1768, and for Portarlington from 1769 to 1783. The couple had three sons: Francis, who died in his father's lifetime; John Roger (<i>d</i>. 6 Feb 1819); and William Henry (<i>d</i>. 29 May 1840). Palmer was created a baronet on 29 May 1777, and died probably in 1790. In the later years of her life Lady Palmer lived in lodgings in Henry Street, Dublin. She was acquainted with many of the leading figures of the day. She knew the poets Byron and Thomas Moore. Richard Lalor Sheil visited her in her old age and noted:<blockquote>after the ordinary formulas of civility, she placed herself in a huge chair, and entered at once into politics. She was a most vehement Catholic &hellip; Lord Fingall and the Catholic question were the only subjects in which she seemed to take any interest. Upon the wrongs to her country she spoke not only with energy, but with eloquence; and with every pinch of snuff, poured out a sentence of sedition. (Sheil, 1.137&#150;8)</blockquote>Lady Palmer died in Dublin either on 10 February 1818, &#145;in the full possession of all her faculties, aged 98&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 88/1, 1818, 379), or on 3 February 1818 in Abbey Street, Dublin, in her hundredth year, according to sources used by G. E. Cockayne when compiling his <span class="italic">Baronetage</span>. A pastel portrait that revealed &#145;seductive eyes, a dazzling complexion, and an arch expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) was exhibited at the Dublin National Portrait Exhibition in 1872, but had been destroyed in a fire by 1895.<br>
