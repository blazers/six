<span class="headword">Dagnall,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1774?), <span class="occ">colliery owner and ivory comb maker</span>, is a figure about whom biographical details are sparse. He lived at Eccleston on the edge of what became the industrial town of St Helens in Lancashire. Many people with the name of Dagnall made hair combs throughout the eighteenth century both in Liverpool and inland around Prescot, first using horn and then ivory imported from Africa. The comb maker Samuel Dagnall was often registered in St Helens chapelry, as were his sons James and Thomas, and Henry Dagnall, a contemporary of Samuel. The only entries at St Helens for Charles Dagnall, ivory comb maker, record the births of his daughters Ann and Margaret in 1736 and 1737. Marriages of Charles Dagnall to Hannah Tickle, registered in Huyton parish in 1724, and to Alice Hill, registered in Liverpool in 1735, were both within the area of the comb-making trade, and may refer to the same person; but his birth and death, the birth of his daughter Rachel, and the birth and death of his son James (who died in 1772 after inheriting &pound;350 from John Tickle) went unregistered. Knowledge of Dagnall depends largely on ten letters written between 1 June 1754 and 9 May 1763, which give a vignette of the vicissitudes and personality of an irascible early modern manufacturer.<br>
<br>In 1746 Dagnall leased the coal beneath land owned by George Rice, Henry Seddon, and Basil Thomas Eccleston, from whom he also leased a 23 acre pastoral holding with a comb shop. The lease provided full rights to enter farm tenants' land in the furtherance of mining (but not, as in later leases, with specified recompense for or restitution after damage). The first recorded steam engine in what was to become St Helens was installed by Dagnall, and things went smoothly until 1753, when he sought to renew the lease. A higher rent was asked, which Dagnall refused. He continued mining at the old rent, but raised the price of his coal from 2<i>d</i>. to 3<i>d</i>. per hundredweight. The colliery's water problems increased costs, took power from the miller, who &#145;plagued&#146; Dagnall in consequence, and flooded and spoiled farmland; the tenants responded by filling pits and interfering with colliery drainage works when damages were refused.<br>
<br>A new lease was drawn up at the higher rent in 1755, but Dagnall still did not sign, and in 1757 he stopped all payment, though he continued to mine and neglected to fill abandoned pits. In his letters Dagnall protested against &#145;ill youmered&#146; third parties, the state of the comb trade and water problems, and blustered that it was unwise to pursue claims against him. Although he had &#145;often wondered that God suffers them so long&#146; that opposed him, he pointed out that Richard Farrar &#145;never dode well after&#146; meddling with his drainage works, and that &#145;God took away his life in a little time after&#146;; John Willcock had &#145;not prospered very well since [abusing me] for he had liked a suffer death&#146;; and of both Mr Chaddock and Mr Deane, who made the same error, Dagnall noted that &#145;death was his End&#146;  (Wrightington MSS, D/D Wr 2755).<br>
<br>Basil Eccleston's initial tolerance of Dagnall may have been because they were both Roman Catholic non-jurors. Attempts to arrange meetings were frustrated, and proposed arbitrators (prominent Roman Catholics among them) refused to act, perhaps because they already knew something about Dagnall. He demurred at one such suggestion because &#145;as to chuseing atorneys I think the writeings between you &amp; me mentions onest men to chuse [and] I heard Late Mr. Geo. Potter say he thought it was nex to imposable for a torney to be onest&#146;  (ibid.). Dagnall did not pay the &pound;185 for which Eccleston sued him in the palatinate court in 1760, disagreed with the &pound;154 13<i>s</i>. fixed by further arbitration in 1762, and was offered a settlement at &pound;125 15<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in 1763  (TNA: PRO, PL 6/82/27). It is unlikely that Dagnall paid the debt.<br>
<br>By 1759 Dagnall had opened two other collieries, one with a steam engine, but they both failed. By 1766 his affairs were in the hands of assignees, and he was declared bankrupt with debts of &pound;2000 in 1770. Dagnall's death probably occurred at Eccleston in 1774, the year in which a law suit was brought against his heirs by his bankruptcy trustees, from whom Dagnall had withheld his late son's inheritance.<br>
