<span class="headword">Ashworth,  Edmund</span>  (1800&#150;1881), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer and free-trade activist</span>, was born on 17 November 1800 at Birtenshaw, Turton, near Bolton, the fifth of the eleven children of John Ashworth (1772&#150;1855), farmer, land agent, and cotton spinner, and his wife, Isabel Thomasson (1772&#150;1852). Edmund was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/795/', "Henry Ashworth (1794&#150;1880)")</script>, a founder of the Anti-Corn Law League. John Ashworth became a Quaker shortly before marrying Edmund's mother in 1793, and Edmund was raised in the Quaker tradition. He received his early education at schools in Bolton and Manchester, but later studied chemistry under John Dalton. In 1831 Edmund married Charlotte Christy (<i>d</i>. 1868) of Chelmsford, Essex, the daughter of Thomas Christy, a wealthy Quaker business associate of the Ashworths. They had nine children, and lived at Egerton Hall, Turton.<br>
<br>Ashworth joined the cotton-spinning firm of John and Edmund Ashworth, his father and uncle respectively, in 1821. At this early stage they were running a fairly modest business at New Eagley Mills, Turton. Edmund and Henry Ashworth (who had joined in 1818), each took one fifth of the profits, though this was increased to one quarter in 1824. From 1831 onwards they were the sole partners in the firm of Henry and Edmund Ashworth. They invested heavily in their own business, and expansion was rapid throughout the 1820s and 1830s. They purchased a partly built mill at Egerton in the early 1830s, finished building it, and equipped it with some of the best machinery then available. By 1835 when they became the sole owners of the mill, it had a spindleage of 49,000 and a dye works. At the same time New Eagley had a total spindleage of 29,000. By 1854 they had added a weaving shed housing 290 looms at New Eagley and employed 1000 people. Good-quality housing, schools, and leisure facilities were also provided for employees.<br>
<br>Edmund Ashworth declined the invitation to stand for one of Bolton's parliamentary seats in 1837 and 1841, but after the Liberals failed to win a seat in 1837, he helped to secure the charter of incorporation for the town the following year. He never sought election to the borough council. Despite his disinclination to hold public office, however, he remained politically active. He was prominent in both the Anti-Corn Law League and in the Manchester chamber of commerce, then at the height of its powers. Despite his general opposition to trade unionists and Chartists, he solicited their support for the free-trade campaign; he advocated non-payment of taxes, and urged members of parliament who supported free trade to hold up other parliamentary business. It was during this period that one contemporary commented that Edmund was &#145;a Quaker of the fighting school&#146;  (J. W. Croker, &#145;Anti-corn-law agitation&#146;, <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, 1, Dec 1842). However, Ashworth did not completely sever his links with Lancashire's gentry and while fighting for the free-trade cause he was also a correspondent and guest of one of the largest Lancashire gentry families, conversing on agricultural matters and attending farming meetings. Ten years later he was to issue a tract on salmon farming.<br>
<br>This political activity, as well as the hardships of the 1840s caused strain on the partnership between the Ashworth brothers. Some of the ensuing disputes were dealt with by Quaker arbitrators, but as the families of Henry and Edmund Ashworth grew, the dissolution of the partnership became more inevitable. This was done in 1854, with Edmund Ashworth taking control of Egerton Mill while Henry took control of New Eagley. In 1864 Edmund retired and control of the firm passed to his sons, Edmund and Samuel, though he remained a senior partner. Edmund Ashworth &amp; Sons was one of the fourteen firms that combined in 1898 to form the English Sewing Cotton Company.<br>
<br>After the battles of the 1840s had been won, Ashworth became less active politically, and the will to expand the business further subsided. The <span class="italic">Bolton Free Press</span>, a Liberal newspaper in which the brothers were principal shareholders, ceased publication in 1847, and despite assisting Cobden to negotiate the Anglo-French commercial treaty in 1860, and involvement with the Cotton Supply Association, Ashworth's public life was rather more limited than it had been previously. On the resignation of Henry from the Manchester chamber of commerce in 1868, Edmund Ashworth became vice-president. He declined the presidency in 1871, but took the office from 1875 to 1877. The chamber was not the force it had previously been, however. He was spending more time hunting in Egerton and Scotland, as well as spending much time in Southport. He was appointed to the Lancashire magistracy on 20 April 1847 and served for thirty-four years, during which time he sat on various committees, including the building committee for the new prison in Manchester, and the Salford district finance committee, of both of which he was chairman. He was also chairman of the newly formed Turton urban district council from 1872 to 1880. Ashworth died on 21 March 1881 at the Prince of Wales Hotel, Southport, and was buried at Walmsley church, Egerton, near Bolton.<br>
<br>Although Edmund Ashworth has failed to make the same impact on the historical record as Henry, this is likely to be an accident of the archives rather than a reflection of his contemporary significance. He was clearly a competent and motivated business man, was politically active and outspoken, and evoked both the respect and criticisms of his contemporaries.<br>
