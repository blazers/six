<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sutherland family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1200&#150;<em>c.</em>1510), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, were descended from Hugh Freskin, who obtained the lands of Sutherland from William the Lion in 1196. Nineteenth-century scholarship, probably misled by the researches of Sir Robert Gordon (completed in 1630, published in 1813 as <span class="italic">A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland</span>) seriously confused the identities and numbers of the earls. Hugh's son William succeeded his father as lord of Sutherland, after 1214, and was created earl of Sutherland at some point between 1223 and 1245. He is said to have died in 1248. William's son, also William, had been infeft as second earl of Sutherland by 1263. He attended the convention at Birgham on 14 March 1290, and in July 1291 was nominated by Edward I to receive fealties to the English king at Inverness. Later he appears to have been actively hostile to the claims of Robert Bruce, possibly preferring the Balliol claim and regarding Bruce as a usurper, and he maintained this position until his death some time between April 1306 and September 1307.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26796"></a><span class="headword">William Sutherland</span>, third earl of Sutherland  (<em>c.</em>1286&#150;1330), was under age when he succeeded his father, as John Ross, younger son of Earl William of Ross, held the young earl of Sutherland in ward, but his tutelage must have been near its end, as William was styled third earl of Sutherland by 16 March 1309 when he appeared at Robert I's first parliament held at St Andrews, having clearly abandoned his father's hostility to Bruce's kingship. He was also present at the parliament held in Arbroath in 1320, appending his seal to the letter to Pope John XXII known as the &#145;declaration of Arbroath&#146;. He died before December 1330, apparently unmarried, and was succeeded by his brother.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54334"></a><span class="headword">Kenneth Sutherland</span>, fourth earl of Sutherland  (<em>d.</em> 1333), was styled earl on 7 December 1330, when he granted a writ to Reginald Moray of Culbin, renouncing all claim to Moray's possessions within the earldom of Sutherland. This agreement formed part of a formal alliance between the two families, which was sealed by the marriage of Reginald Moray's son, Gilbert, to Sutherland's daughter, Eustachia. After the death of Thomas Randolph, regent of Scotland, in 1332, Sutherland may have become active in opposing the following year's English invasion, for he was killed at the battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333. He was married to Lady Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18020/', "Donald, sixth earl of Mar")</script>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26798"></a><span class="headword">William Sutherland</span>, fifth earl of Sutherland  (<em>d.</em> 1370/71), who succeeded his father in 1333, is said by the Lanercost chronicle to have joined with the earls of Fife and Dunbar, in laying siege to the castle of Cupar in 1336, held at that time by William Bullock for the English. In 1340 he raided into England with the earl of March; they inflicted considerable damage, but suffered a defeat on their return journey at the hands of Sir Thomas Gray. In 1341 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3726/', "David II")</script> returned to Scotland after spending nine years in France, and Sutherland clearly found considerable favour at court, sufficient to receive the king's sister Margaret in marriage, papal dispensation for the match being given at the end of 1342.<br>
<br>Sutherland's rising influence was such that the earldom of Sutherland was erected into a free regality on 10 October 1345, while on 4 November the barony of Cluny in Aberdeenshire was added to Sutherland's possessions. On 30 March 1346 he and his wife received a grant of the stronghold of Dunnottar in the Mearns, together with a special licence to build a fortalice upon the crag. In 1346 Sutherland joined the king's army which invaded England, but the campaign ended with the defeat of the Scots at the battle of Nevilles Cross, and with the capture of David II and of Sutherland himself. Sutherland is next recorded in June 1351, when he received a safe conduct to go to Newcastle to negotiate David II's ransom. In September his infant son John, born in 1346, was handed over as a hostage; John's important position as his royal uncle's nearest male heir enabled David II to return to Scotland for a few months. In 1357 Sutherland and his son were both handed over as hostages. The earl remained in England for more than ten years, while according to Walter Bower, the young John Sutherland died of plague at Lincoln on 8 September 1361, thus ending any Sutherland hopes of a royal succession.<br>
<br>David II made a number of grants to Sutherland, including the barony and castle of Urquhart, on 28 February 1359, apparently in exchange for thanages in Kincardineshire, while between 1360 and 1365 he received a number of grants from the exchequer, in addition to &pound;80 paid by David II towards Sutherland's expenses in England. In terms of political influence, however, Sutherland's day was over, possibly because of the machinations of the faction led by Robert Stewart, whose members would have had readier access to the king while Sutherland was languishing in England. It may have been due to Stewart that David II was in no hurry to secure Sutherland's release. Sutherland had returned to Scotland by the time a grant was issued to him on 27 February 1370, but he must have died before June 1371, when the barony of Urquhart was back in royal hands. Following the death of his first wife, Margaret Bruce, possibly in 1346, Sutherland had married Joanna Menteith by November 1347. With his second wife, Earl William had a son who succeeded him.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26795"></a><span class="headword">Robert Sutherland</span>, sixth earl of Sutherland  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1427?), who was formerly misnamed William and thought to have died perhaps in 1398, may have been still a minor in 1371, and Alexander Stewart, lord of Badenoch and younger son of Robert II, was administering the earldom of Sutherland as Robert's guardian by October 1372, conducting business from the chief Sutherland stronghold of Dunrobin in 1373&#150;4. However, in 1384 the chronicler Froissart refers to Robert as welcoming a party of French knights to Scotland, and the same writer, despite inaccurately naming him John, credits Sutherland with leading the Scottish force which invaded north-west England in 1388. He first appears in government records on 2 November 1389, when he was present at the condemnation of his erstwhile guardian and then father-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26451/', "Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan")</script>. On 22 January 1401 Sutherland issued a grant from the castle of Dunrobin to his brother, Kenneth, but the rest of his career is rather obscure. The date of his death has been placed in 1442, but he was probably dead by 1427; the earl of Sutherland sent to England in that year as a hostage for James I's ransom seems less likely to have been Earl Robert than the latter's son John, born of Robert's marriage to Lady Margaret Stewart, daughter of Alexander, earl of Buchan.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_66132"></a><span class="headword">John Sutherland</span>, seventh earl of Sutherland  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1460), wrongly identified as Robert in the nineteenth century, is mentioned by the chronicler Wyntoun as having been knighted by his uncle, Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan, when the latter took a Scottish contingent to Flanders in 1408. He was sent to England as a hostage for James I's ransom in 1427, probably very soon after the death of his father, and he remained there for many years, confined in Pontefract Castle, where he married Margaret Baillie (<i>d</i>. 1509/10), probably a relative of one of his fellow hostages at Pontefract, Sir William Baillie of Hoprig and Lamington. Sutherland was still at Pontefract in July 1444, but had been released by May 1448, when he was at Dunrobin Castle, presenting a chaplain to the chapel of St Andrew at Golspie. On 29 April 1451 Sutherland and his wife received a crown charter of lands in the parish of Loth, Sutherland; the rents from these were reserved for their use during their lifetimes when, on 22 February 1456, Sutherland resigned his earldom into the hands of James II in favour of his son John. Three days later John was infeft in the lands of the earldom during his father's lifetime, by precept of sasine given by James II at Inverness. The reason for this move is unclear, but it may have been prompted by the earl's ill health. The seventh earl was dead by 1460, and was buried in the chapel of St Andrew at Golspie.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54335"></a><span class="headword">John Sutherland</span>, eighth earl of Sutherland  (<em>d.</em> 1508), was accused by Sir Robert Gordon, in his history of the family, of using his mother and relatives with great cruelty. He seems to have suffered from a form of mental illness, and in 1494 a brieve of idiotry was issued by James IV, which resulted in a declaration of Sutherland's inability to manage his affairs. He was placed under the tutelage of Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, and died in 1508, when he was succeeded by his son John, who was to suffer from the same mental affliction. John was the son of the first of the eighth earl's three marriages; his mother may have been the daughter of Alexander Macdonald, lord of the Isles. There were no children of the eighth earl's two later marriages, to Fingole, widow of John Munro of Foulis (which probably ended in divorce), and to Catherine (surname unknown), who outlived him.<br>
