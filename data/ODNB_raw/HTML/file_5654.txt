<span class="headword">Clifford,  John</span>, ninth Baron Clifford  (1435&#150;1461), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, sometimes known as &#145;the Butcher&#146;, was born at Conisbrough Castle in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 8 April 1435, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5663/', "Thomas Clifford, eighth Baron Clifford (1414&#150;1455)")</script>, and his wife, Joan Dacre (<i>b</i>. before 1424, <i>d</i>. before 1455). Conisbrough was the dower house of his great-aunt Maud, countess of Cambridge, who was one of John's godparents, and later left him twelve silver dishes in her will. Nothing else is known of his childhood and youth, and it is in keeping with the rest of his short adult life that he should be next recorded on 24 August 1453, supporting the Percys, allies of the Cliffords since the 1390s, in their confrontation with the Nevilles, equally long-term adversaries in north-west England of the Cliffords, on Heworth Moor near York. In the following year he became a father. His wife was Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1493), daughter and heir of Henry Bromflete, Lord Vescy, and their marriage appears to have formed part of Thomas Clifford's programme of expanding his interests in parts of the north relatively free from Neville domination. Husband and wife would later join the York Corpus Christi Guild.<br>
<br>On 22 May 1455 Thomas Clifford was killed in battle with the duke of York and the Nevilles at St Albans. John Clifford was still a few months under age, and not until 5 July 1456 did he enter into his inheritance. To an already prolonged contest with the Nevilles for pre-eminence in the north-west he brought additional bitterness arising from a desire for vengeance. For a while the conflict was precariously contained by Yorkist control of government, and by the efforts of king and council to make peace. On 24 March 1458 it was arranged in King Henry's name that Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, should pay 1000 marks (&pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) to John Clifford and his brothers and sisters, in compensation for their father's death. But the fact that Clifford, ominously described as one of &#145;the yong lordes whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Chronicle</span>, 77), had earlier arrived in London alongside the sons of the earl of Northumberland, also killed at St Albans, at the head of a force of 1500 men, forcibly underlines the difficulties facing any would-be peacemaker. The king's settlement, and the ceremonious &#145;loveday&#146; that followed it, had little effect. Queen Margaret became ever more dominant in government, and Clifford's energy made him an increasingly important supporter of the Lancastrian cause&#151;a propaganda poem of 1458 names him as one of the components of the &#145;well good sayle&#146; of the ship of state  (Robbins, 192&#150;3).<br>
<br>Clifford became increasingly active away from the court. A JP in Westmorland since 1456, in July 1458 he was also appointed to the bench for the West Riding of Yorkshire. Summoned to the Coventry parliament of November 1459, he took the oath of allegiance to the king, queen, and Prince Edward on 11 December. Eight days later he was granted the honour and castle of Penrith, forfeited by the earl of Salisbury; the Nevilles' control of Penrith had been particularly obnoxious to the Cliffords, thanks to its proximity to their own lordship in north Westmorland and their castle at Brougham. On 8 April 1460 Clifford was appointed warden of the west march, another office recently monopolized by the Nevilles. The fact that he was ordered to raise men in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Northumberland to resist the duke of York and other rebels indicates how he was expected to use the resources of his wardenry. On 8 October 1460, following the Yorkist victory at Northampton, Clifford was ordered to surrender Penrith to Salisbury. Two days later the duke of York claimed the throne, precipitating an all-out dynastic conflict.<br>
<br>Clifford had been summoned to the parliament that was to debate York's claims, but does not appear to have attended it. He had probably remained in the north, where he was one of the lords who assembled at Hull to meet with Queen Margaret, and subsequently gathered in council at York, before setting out to destroy the tenants of the duke of York and earl of Salisbury. Clifford was himself later said to have engaged in pillage, and also to have recruited men by &#145;moost drad proclamations&#146;  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 6.20). On 31 December 1460 the Lancastrians overwhelmed York and his men at Wakefield. Clifford was knighted by the duke of Somerset immediately before the battle, which subsequently brought him considerable notoriety, much of it first reported only several decades after the event. It is John Leland, writing in the years around 1540, who reports that Clifford &#145;for killing of men at this bataill was caullid the boucher&#146;  (<span class="italic">Itinerary</span>, 1.41). To Leland's general attribution of slaughter and mayhem has been added a more specific charge, the slaying of the young Edmund, earl of Rutland, York's second son. This is first ascribed to Clifford in the <span class="italic">Annales</span> of William Worcester, a contemporary source. But whereas Worcester records baldly that Clifford killed Rutland on Wakefield Bridge as he fled from the battle, Edward Hall, in his <span class="italic">Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Famelies of Lancastre &amp; Yorke</span>, completed about 1532 and published in 1548, provides an altogether more circumstantial account of the deed (later heavily drawn upon by Shakespeare). Here Rutland, his age reduced from seventeen to twelve, and accompanied by a tutor, pleads voicelessly for mercy, &#145;for his speache was gone for feare&#146;, but is pitilessly struck down by Clifford, with the words &#145;By God's blode, thy father slew myne, and so wil I do the and all thy kyn&#146;  (Hall, 250&#150;51). This may indeed have been how Clifford felt towards York and his family, but whether he actually voiced his feelings thus may be doubted.<br>
<br>Following their victory at Wakefield, the Lancastrians moved south, Clifford among them. He fought at the second battle of St Albans, on 17 February 1461, and it was reportedly in his tent that Henry VI was afterwards reunited with Queen Margaret and Prince Edward. But the Lancastrians lost the initiative by failing to capture London, and retreated north, with the Yorkists in slow pursuit. On 28 March there was a sharp contest for the passage of the Aire at Ferrybridge. A force led by Clifford captured the bridge, but was itself attacked in the flank by Yorkists who had crossed the river upstream, and Clifford was killed&#151;according to tradition he fell at Dittingdale, near Castlebridge, struck in the throat by a headless arrow. His body seems to have been cast into a common burial pit. Following the shattering defeat of the Lancastrians at Towton on the following day, Clifford was attainted and his lands forfeited; his Westmorland estates were later granted to the earl of Warwick. The tribulations undergone by his young heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5646/', "Henry Clifford")</script>, the so-called Shepherd Lord, appear to be mythical, but the ruin of the family was for the time being complete. John Clifford left two sons and two daughters. His widow, who lived until 1493, married Sir Lawrence Threlkeld, a Westmorland landowner, with whom she had one son and two daughters.<br>
