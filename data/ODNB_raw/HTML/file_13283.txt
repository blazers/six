<span class="headword">Hill,  Joseph</span>  (1625&#150;1707), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born at Bramley, near Leeds, Yorkshire, in October 1625. His father, Joshua Hill, was minister successively at Walmsley Chapel, Lancashire, and Bramley Chapel, and died in 1632, a few hours before the arrival at his house of a citation for not wearing a surplice. Joseph Hill attended school at Pocklington, Yorkshire, and was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on 20 August 1646, graduating BA in 1649. He became a fellow of Magdalene College, proceeding MA there in 1651. Hill knew the young Samuel Pepys, admonishing him on 21 October 1653 for having been &#145;scandalously overseene in drink the night before&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.67). Hill was a popular tutor at Magdalene and served as senior proctor in 1658. In 1660 he kept the act for the degree of BD, and when he declined to conform in 1662 the authorities &#145;cut his name out of their books in kindness to him&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.81), preventing his formal ejection. He was a lecturer between 1660 and 1662 at All Hallows Barking. When he met Pepys again in July 1661 Hill was less censorious than he had been eight years earlier. Over glasses of wine in a tavern in Pope's Head Alley he was confident that &#145;the King now would be forced to favour Presbytery, or the City would leave him&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.141). Despite the loss of his fellowship, and with the act against conventicles soon to pass the Commons, Pepys found Hill continuingly optimistic for the future of the church.<br>
<br>This could not be sustained for long, and Hill, &#145;considering the dissensions in England about Church government, etc, resolved to settle beyond sea, that I might be quiet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Eminent Men</span>, 1.254). At Leiden he stayed for two years with Matthew Newcomen, pastor of the English church there, entering Leiden University as a student on 29 March 1664. He returned in 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, landing on the Suffolk coast in a Dutch vessel, together with many other English persons. Papers in his possession were confiscated and he was pronounced &#145;as dangerous a person as could have been sent &hellip; to do the Dutch intelligence from England&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1665&#150;6</i>, 520). The documents found on him seem to have been quite innocuous. They included a request to procure the release of a Dutch minister held prisoner in Chelsea College, and a letter dated 3 July 1666 from Richard Mayden, minister of the English Reformed church at Amsterdam, to Peter Herringhooke, a merchant of London. This revealed that Hill wished to marry the writer's daughter Elizabeth, and had come over to settle his estate in England. He was imprisoned, but was shortly released, having undertaken not to return to the Netherlands. After the war hysteria died down, however, he did return, married Elizabeth Mayden, and following his election on 19 June 1667 was invested on 7 August as minister of the Scottish church at Middelburg, Zeeland.<br>
<br>There Hill remained until 1673. In that year, following the French invasion of the Dutch republic and the revolution which had brought William of Orange to power, he committed to the press of Amsterdam anonymously, under the guise of a patriotic Dutchman, &#145;a well-wisher to the Reformed Religion, and the welfare of these countries&#146;, <span class="italic">The Interest of these United Provinces, being a Defence of the Zeelanders Choice</span>. On the title-page he laid out his position:<blockquote>
<div>I. That we ought unanimously to defend ourselves.<br>
</div>
<div>II. That if we cannot, it is better to be under England than France, in regard of Religion, Liberty, Estates and Trade.<br>
</div>
<div>III. That we are not yet come to that extremity, but we may remaine a Republick, and that our Compliance with England is the onely meanes for this.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The ostensible audience for the book was Dutch; it was an exhortation to maintain the war effort against the French. Hill's book, a quite substantial work, interesting for the knowledge it displays of the diplomatic history of the century, contended that English policy had for too long been distorted by a fixation upon the danger from Spain. This had been cleverly encouraged by the dangerous and aggressive French: &#145;how far they have overgrown Spain in power &hellip; so great they overshadow us all&#146;  (sig. P2). Translated into English, the book can be read in the light of a second audience as part of the propaganda war being waged by William III and his agents to win over public opinion in England and so pressure Charles II into breaking his alliance with the French. Yet with its argument that it was better to be subjected to the English enemy than the French and talk of compliance rather than alliance, it was perhaps a rather more ambiguous work. Where it was unambiguous was in its warning against the French threat, and following complaints from the French ambassador the Dutch authorities found it politic to order, on 19 August 1673, that the author be expelled until the end of the war. As he later recorded it Hill was &#145;banichsed, <i>duranto bello</i>, by a Frenchified party in the States&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Eminent Men</span>, 1.254).<br>
<br>The ambiguity of Hill's position is further highlighted and perhaps explained by his reception on his return to England: Charles II rewarded him with the sinecure rectory of Llandinam, Montgomeryshire, worth &pound;90 a year. Hill arranged that his nephew, John Spademan, later a fellow minister at Rotterdam, should be presented to the living (as he was on 18 December 1674), but should pass its profits to him. This arrangement was challenged in 1689 by the dean and chapter of Bangor on the grounds that Spademan had not taken the requisite oaths and was in the Netherlands anyway, so that the living was vacant in fact and in law. On 8 August 1696, after much dispute, the diocese agreed that Hill should be paid &pound;70 a year. The original grant and its continuation were almost certainly a payment for Hill's activities as a government agent. In or before 1702 Hill wrote to the earl of Nottingham: complaining that &#145;my sine-cure was wrested from me by a punctilio by law&#146; he offered to continue to perform the work he had done for previous secretaries of state. Obscure references in Aphra Behn's correspondence hint that he may already have been an agent by the late 1660s, though the firmest evidence comes from the 1690s.<br>
<br>Among Hill's most lasting achievements was his expanded version of Schrevelius's Greek&#150;Latin lexicon, published in 1663. Another achievement was reported, though not perhaps purely out of altruism, on 25 June 1677, by William Millington, a London auctioneer, who wrote to Hill of his &#145;great Service done to Learning and Learned men in your first advising and effectually setting on foot that admirable and Universally approved way of selling Librarys by Auction amongst us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 265). Hill left England soon afterwards. On 13 January 1678 he was instituted as a minister of the English Presbyterian church at Rotterdam. On 1 September 1681 Hill wrote to his old acquaintance Pepys explaining his emigration: &#145;being tired with the buss of both parties in London, I retired hither, where I live to my owne content in great peace and quietness, above the frownes of fortune and below the envy of my enemies&#146;  (ibid.). On 17 June 1687 Hill was in touch with Richard Baxter about the distribution of his <span class="italic">Methodus theologiae</span>, reporting the relief occasioned in the Netherlands by the news of the latter's release from prison. Further letters to Pepys from Rotterdam of 16 November and 7 December 1697 provided unofficial briefings on the negotiations leading to the treaty of Ryswick, and offered assistance to Pepys in the preparation of &#145;your great work of your Naval history&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Private Correspondence</span>, 145). In 1707 Hill found it necessary to complain to Robert Harley that he had not been paid for his services as a government agent since the late 1690s, at the same time offering to sell him his coin collection. Hill was an indefatigable student and book collector, retaining to the last his habit of reading, though his memory had nearly gone. He died at Rotterdam on 5 November 1707.<br>
<br>Hill is sometimes confused with his namesake <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13284/', "Joseph Hill")</script>, not least because the latter also served, between 1699 and 1718, as a minister in the English Presbyterian church at Rotterdam.<br>
