<span class="headword">Stewart,  Frederick</span>  (1836&#150;1889), <span class="occ">educationist and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 17 October 1836 at Rathen, near Fraserburgh, Scotland, the eldest of the three children of James Stewart (<i>bap</i>. 1810, <i>d</i>. 1896), a crofter and merchant tailor, and his wife, Jane (Jean) Stewart (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1874), the daughter of a farmer, Alexander Brown, and his wife, Catherine Lyon Brown. He was educated first at Rathen parish school and Aberdeen grammar school, where he studied under W. D. Strahan, the Latinist James Melvin, and the Greek scholar W. D. Geddes. In 1859 he headed the honours list at King's College, Aberdeen, with a first class in intellectual and moral sciences. He then studied at Divinity Hall, Aberdeen University. While occupying a vacation position at Stubbington House School, near Fareham, Hampshire, he applied for the concurrent posts in Hong Kong of headmaster of the new Hong Kong Government Central School for [Chinese] Boys and inspector of government schools for Chinese.<br>
<br>Popular among fellow pupils and students, Stewart was glowingly recommended by the principal of Aberdeen University, P. C. Campbell, and at his interview with the chairman of the Hong Kong board of education, George Smith, first (Anglican) bishop of Victoria, he was selected for appointment. He then abandoned his preparation for the Presbyterian ministry and sailed from Southampton by Peninsular and Oriental steamer on 20 December 1861. He disembarked at Hong Kong on 15 February 1862.<br>
<br>Although much developed since its first (unofficial) British occupation in 1841, Hong Kong was still a barren rock. Smaller-scale earlier missionary initiatives in education for the Chinese, largely fruitless in establishing a Chinese Christian ministry for the conversion of China, had been abandoned. The increased access to China granted by a recent treaty highlighted the British need for bilinguals. With its growing Chinese population mixed with English and other nationals, Hong Kong itself needed culturally sympathetic residents who could intercommunicate.<br>
<br>Stewart passionately valued education for individual fulfilment and only secondly for society's needs. Over the next sixteen years he established, developed, and managed both a school and a system, learning and using spoken Cantonese and written Chinese in his work. On 30 June 1865 he became the first head of the government education department. He enjoyed strong support from the governors Sir Richard MacDonnell and Sir Arthur Kennedy, but his work was obstructed after the arrival as governor in 1877 of John Pope Hennessy, who unfairly faulted the English-language achievements of Stewart's Central School pupils and disapproved of the dual curriculum which was the school's unique and particular strength.<br>
<br>After registering a minority vote at a one-day educational conference called by Hennessy in 1878, Stewart left for his planned only home leave. Before he embarked, representative groups of residents showed their support by deputations, addresses, and gifts. The Colonial Office consulted Stewart at length in London during his year's leave, and consequently requested Hennessy in future to consult Stewart on all educational matters. But, to public indignation, Hennessy replaced Stewart as inspector of schools immediately he returned to Hong Kong. Stewart protested to no avail. Soon news arrived that the University of Aberdeen had awarded him an LLD.<br>
<br>In 1881 Stewart was appointed police magistrate and resigned as headmaster of the Central School. In 1883, on the initiative of the Colonial Office, and under a new governor, Sir George Bowen, he was appointed registrar-general and protector of Chinese. In 1884 former pupils&#151;now community leaders&#151;established in his honour the Central School Stewart scholarship. Bowen twice recommended him for the CMG, but Stewart deflected the award, writing, &#145;My ambition is to be allowed to do my work and be left unknown to the World at large&#146;  (Bickley, <span class="italic">Golden Needle</span>, 234). In 1887 Stewart was appointed colonial secretary&#151;the head of the permanent civil service&#151;and he occasionally acted as governor.<br>
<br>After a short illness, probably caused by a chill, Stewart died of double pneumonia at his home, 10 Arbuthnot Road, Hong Kong, on 29 September 1889. The next day's private funeral procession to the protestant cemetery, Happy Valley, of the man the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> considered one of Hong Kong's &#145;ablest officials&#146;  (Bickley, <span class="italic">Golden Needle</span>, 255), was the largest that the colony had experienced; it was attended by leading officials, dignitaries, merchants, and religious leaders, and the school Stewart founded. A memorial stained-glass window was erected in St John's Cathedral by public subscription. His successor Bateson Wright wrote that Stewart would &#145;ever be famous as the Founder of Education&#146; in Hong Kong  (Bickley, &#145;Contact pedagogies&#146;, 382). A grateful pupil&#151;in the first Chinese to be knighted by the British crown&#151;willed instructions for maintaining Stewart's grave. Stewart's personal estate, at just over &pound;2000, was considered surprisingly small, a result of continual quiet acts of charity.<br>
<br>Stewart never married. His mother and brother having predeceased him, his will named his aged father and spinster sister. A third beneficiary was a young Macanese who, with his pregnant wife, was living with Stewart in Stewart's large house when he died. Also mentioned were a friend from Stewart's student days and the University of Aberdeen. He was remembered as scholarly, modest, and reclusive; yet he had warm friends and many admirers. When British administration of Hong Kong ended on 30 June 1997, Stewart Road and Stewart Terrace still bore his name. The prestigious Queen's College (the former Central School) had a Stewart house and the Stewart scholarship.<br>
<br>Stewart's own classical education taught him cultural and historical perspective and the need for cultural accommodation. During his time, many in Hong Kong were too poor to educate their children: school attendance among the farming and large transient fishing communities was irregular and Chinese girls generally were not educated. Stewart had appeals distributed door to door to encourage attendance. In 1873 he established a successful grant-in-aid scheme for non-government schools (generally warmly supported by missionaries) and secured considerable increases in the proportion of children attending school. In 1889 he supported a successful initiative to extend government Western education taught through English to Chinese girls.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, responding to Chinese conservatism, Stewart accepted that the full-scale changes that he hoped for would take time; he confided to readers of his thirteen published annual inspector's reports (1866&#150;1878) that: &#145;education &hellip; bears a relation not to this arbitrary standard or to that, but to the particular mental condition of the people among whom it is being disseminated&#146;  (Bickley, &#145;Plus &ccedil;a change&#146;, 295).<br>
<br>Stewart's early influences were also apparent in the high moral tone of his popular school, which in 1867 was opened to all races and nationalities. Nevertheless, controversy followed his principled decision to omit direct Christian instruction in government schools.<br>
<br>Through his work in setting up a government education system which accommodated the best of two cultures&#151;English and Chinese languages, Western and Chinese curricula, and modern and traditional pedagogies&#151;Stewart made an important impact on Hong Kong society and contributed to the modernization of China and Western influence by his own educational example, the pedagogical materials produced for his schools, and the pupils educated within his system. Bilingual and bicultural pupils from the flagship Hong Kong Government Central School for Boys provided suitable entrants to the Chinese government's modern schools and staff for many Chinese institutions, including Sir Robert Hart's maritime customs service. Several won positions of influence in the imperial Chinese or Hong Kong colonial governments. Others, admiring Western communities, became revolutionaries, most notably Sun Yatsen, whose Chinese republic replaced the Manchu empire in 1911. The Central School also provided a nucleus of students for the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, of which Stewart was the first rector. This developed into the University of Hong Kong, and the seed was sown for the later mature expansion of Western-style tertiary education in this former British crown colony.<br>
