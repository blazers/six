<span class="headword">Page,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> 1758), <span class="occ">highwayman</span>, was baptized on 22 October 1729 at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Hampton, Middlesex, the son of William Page (<i>d</i>. 1740) and his wife, Mary. His father is said to have been a bargeman in the coal trade who drowned in the Thames above Putney Bridge in 1740. Page received a rudimentary education, apparently at a charity school in Hampton, and it was there that he met his future confederate William Darwell. Giving evidence at Page's trial at the Old Bailey in 1758, one who had known Page and Darwell as children at Hampton remembered that they were &#145;acquainted like brothers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Sessions Papers</span>). Page entered domestic service. According to his contemporary biographer, however, he was of too &#145;proud and haughty&#146; a spirit to submit to orders and eventually resolved to become a highwayman in order to throw off &#145;that badge of slavery, a livery&#146;, and set himself &#145;on a level with gentlemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Genuine Narrative</span>, 4).<br>
<br>Page pursued his new trade with businesslike efficiency. He made a careful study of the roads around London and took pains to disguise and alter his appearance. It is said that he frequently drove out from London in a phaeton and pair, parking the carriage in a secluded spot, changing clothes, and saddling one of the horses in order to commit robberies. Afterwards he would return to the phaeton, resume his former disguise, and drive back to London. Page never drew attention to himself by speaking of his activities as a highwayman, and for many years he levied a toll upon travellers approaching or leaving the capital. Before his last arrest in 1757 he was brought to trial only once. This occurred at Hertford at the Lent assizes of 1753. Page was indicted for robbing a Mr Savile Cockayne Cust of his purse on the highway on 10 January 1753. An impressive array of witnesses was marshalled against him but Page was able to produce evidence that he was elsewhere at the time of the offence and he was acquitted.<br>
<br>In 1755 Page teamed up with his old schoolfriend Darwell and, on and off, the two robbed together for the next two years. Strenuous efforts to hunt them down were made by the Bow Street magistrate John Fielding after their robbery of Laurence Shirley, fourth Earl Ferrers, on the Northern Road, Hertfordshire, on 16 February 1757. Typical of the many entries in Fielding's accounts is one dated 9 March 1757: &#145;Paid Phillipson &amp; Jones for watching one week at the Red Lyon near Westminster Bridge &hellip; to apprehend Page, &pound;3 10s. 6d.&#146; The hunt became so intense that Page visited Scotland. In July he was back, working the Tonbridge Road in Kent with Darwell and robbing the post-chaise of the bishop of Bath and Wells in Maidenhead Thicket. It was his last major success. Darwell was taken near Sevenoaks and in order to save his own life divulged Page's regular haunts and agreed to give evidence against him. Page was arrested at the Golden Lion, near Grosvenor Square Gate, London, and committed to Newgate on 8 August 1757. In his possession were three loaded pistols, a wig, a cockade, and &#145;a curious plan of the roads round London in his own handwriting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 10 Aug 1757). Fielding was largely responsible for assembling the evidence against Page, and the importance he attached to the task is indicated by such entries in his accounts as: &#145;Paid to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh to bring an evidence against Page to town from thence, &pound;8 8s. 0d.&#146;  (30 Sept 1757).<br>
<br>In February 1758 Page was brought to trial at the Old Bailey for robbing John Webb in Bedfont Lane, Middlesex, in March 1757 of two pistols, a purse containing 9 guineas, and a gold watch. The only material evidence adduced against him was Darwell's and Page did much to undermine it by reminding the court that &#145;he [Darwell] would have given testimony against any person that he should happen to fix upon to save his own life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Bailey Sessions Papers</span>). Page was acquitted but detained in custody pending indictment in four other counties. The acquittal damaged Darwell's credibility as a witness, and when Page was next tried, at the Lent assizes at Hertford for the robbery of Earl Ferrers, he was again acquitted. He was then indicted at the Lent assizes for Kent at Rochester for robbing Thomas Farrington of a gold watch and 20 guineas in January 1757. On this occasion Darwell's testimony was supported by that of a witness who identified Page as the man who had pawned the watch, and he was convicted and sentenced to death.<br>
<br>Page was about 5 feet 11 inches tall and of gentlemanly appearance and manner. He was hanged on Pennenden Heath, near Maidstone, on 6 April 1758, and was survived by his wife, about whom no details are known. With Darwell alone Page is said to have committed more than 300 robberies. Such claims are now impossible to substantiate or refute. He was, nevertheless, one of the most able and successful of all eighteenth-century highwaymen, and his success is the more remarkable in that it occurred at a time when improved communications and the police reforms of John and Henry Fielding were beginning to make the roads around London unsafe for highwaymen.<br>
