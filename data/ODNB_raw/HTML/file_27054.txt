<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1808), <span class="occ">writer</span>, entered the service of the East India Company in 1776 as a cadet in the Bombay army. He was promoted lieutenant on 1 May 1780, captain in December 1789, major on 20 March 1797, and lieutenant-colonel on 6 March 1800. At some time before 22 August 1789 he married. On that date he set out from London with his wife, two male companions, and two servants for an overland journey to India. Personal matters demanded his attention in India and, there being no prospect of his travelling by the normal sea voyage, he resolved to make an overland journey. He later described it in <span class="italic">Travels from England to India in 1789 by way of the Tyrol, Venice, Scandaroon, Aleppo and over the Great Desart to Bussora</span> (2 vols., 1799). This work is an odd mixture of a travel journal, a compendium of useful information for travellers, a discussion of the strategic importance of the Middle East as a meeting place of East and West, an analysis of the contemporary strategic and political situations in the Middle East and India, and a detailed account of why the overland route to India is preferable to the normal sea route. Taylor had no eye for landscape, little interest in the individuals he met, and no pretensions to a pleasing style. While seeking to show that the overland route was perfectly feasible for ordinary travellers, Taylor did not attempt to boast its attractions. Instead he relentlessly described the delays he experienced in Europe, where he bemoaned the shortage of horses as a continual problem, his descriptions of the places he passed through being largely confined to practical details concerning accommodation and provisions which the traveller might need to know.<br>
<br>After successfully making the overland journey to India, Taylor became a firm advocate of the route. In 1795, after having made his journey but before having published his <span class="italic">Travels</span>, he published <span class="italic">Considerations on the practicability and advantages of a more speedy communication between Great Britain and her possessions in India</span>. This work was based on James Capper's <span class="italic">Observations on the Passage to India</span> (1783) but Taylor particularly recommended the use of the overland route for letters through Egypt, he having found the delay in receiving news in India particularly frustrating and having successfully taken with him several important papers on his own overland voyage. Taylor published two more works on India before his death at Poona on 10 October 1808. Under the terms of his will his wife, Joanna, was his sole executor and residuary legatee. She was described as his &#145;present wife&#146; and thus may or may not have been the wife who accompanied him on his voyage. Joanna had entrusted to her the care of his natural daughter.<br>
<br>The John Taylor described above should not be confused with <a name="cosubject_27054"></a><span class="headword">John Taylor</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">translator</span>, who was born in Edinburgh and graduated MD from the university in 1804. He entered the Bombay service and was appointed assistant surgeon on 26 March 1808, and promoted surgeon in 1821. He was the author of several translations from Sanskrit and was a member of the Asiatic Society of Bombay and of the Literary Society of Bombay. He died on 6 December 1821 at Shiraz, Persia, leaving a son, John (1804&#150;1856), who became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and died in that city on 14 July 1856.<br>
