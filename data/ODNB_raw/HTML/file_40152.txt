<span class="headword">Boxer,  (Charles) Mark Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Marc]</span>  (1931&#150;1988), <span class="occ">cartoonist and magazine editor</span>, was born on 19 May 1931 in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, the only son and younger child of Lieutenant-Colonel (Harold) Stephen Boxer, garage owner and car salesman, and his wife, Isobel Victoria Hughlings Jackson. He was educated at Boarsted, at Berkhamsted School, and at King's College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Boxer cut an immediate dash. To contemporaries his slender elegance, charm, and wit seemed immensely sophisticated, even intimidating. As a youth he appeared mature, as an adult boyish. In his first term he acted as Tybalt, all in white, for the Marlowe Society, and also drew for a comic magazine, <span class="italic">Granta</span>. He became editor the next year (1952), and took more interest in style than content; the content undid him. A poem contained the lines:<blockquote>
<div>You drunken gluttonous seedy God<br>
</div>
<div>You son of a bitch, you snotty old sod.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This was deemed blasphemous, and he was sent down for a week. Though he could have taken finals, he chose not to do so and left Cambridge in a hearse, followed by a crowd of perhaps a thousand protesters.<br>
<br>In London, Boxer worked briefly on the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, a fashion magazine called <span class="italic">Ambassador</span>, and <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>, and drew for <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. In 1957 Jocelyn Stevens, a Cambridge friend, bought <span class="italic">Queen</span> and made him art director. Boxer hired the best photographers, displayed their work to maximum advantage, and was a large contributor to the magazine's conspicuous success. In 1962 he was the editor who launched the <span class="italic">Sunday Times Magazine</span>. Of the first issue its proprietor, Roy Thomson, who was paying for it, commented &#145;This is awful, absolutely awful&#146;; even so Thomson carried the losses and the magazine. It became one of the major developments in British journalism of its time&#151;much copied but rarely equalled. Boxer remained as editor until 1965 and stayed on as assistant editor until 1979. He was a director of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in 1964&#150;6. In 1965 a listings magazine, <span class="italic">London Life</span>, of which he was editorial director, came and went; his only spectacular failure.<br>
<br>Over the same years Boxer had become famous as the outstanding pocket cartoonist of his time, under the name Marc. His reputation was made at <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1969&#150;83), where his work showed to best advantage, but he later worked for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. He had a detailed knowledge of the manners and customs of the establishment, the upper classes, and newly fashionable &#145;swinging London&#146;. His own background and his left-wing views, conventional at the time, gave him the necessary distance. He did not deal directly with political issues, but reported what certain types would (revealingly) say about them. He also had an extraordinary eye for details of dress. He was cartoonist of the year in 1972. His caricatures, for profiles in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">London Review of Books</span>, and, after 1987, the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, were witty. Immediately pleasing because of his skill at catching a slightly distorted likeness, they were often sharp, even wounding. He said himself that the best compliment was when the subject asked if he could buy the original and then after a day or two reconsidered. He also developed, from one of Alan Bennett's ideas, the Stringalongs, who first appeared in a strip cartoon in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>. Based on friends, they were viewed without affection and with merciless accuracy. Among his most effective illustrations for books were those which appeared in Clive James's <span class="italic">The Fate of Felicity Fark</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Britannia Bright's Bewilderment</span> (1976), and in Alan Watkins's <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span> (1982), and on the jackets of the novels of Anthony Powell. In 1980 he became a director of the publisher Weidenfeld and Nicolson, but he returned to magazines to edit <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> in 1983&#150;6. This time a dowdy magazine had already been livened up by Tina Brown, and Boxer's job, successfully carried out, was to maintain its vitality and widen its appeal. In 1986 he was made editorial director of Cond&eacute; Nast in Europe, and in 1987 editor-in-chief of <span class="italic">Vogue</span>. Thus he ended as he had begun; if he ever wished for a more serious role, there was no sign of it in his career. A stylish cricketer, he did everything that he did exceptionally well, and left a precise and amusing portrait of the world he lived in.<br>
<br>In 1956 Boxer married Lady Arabella Stuart, youngest daughter of Francis Douglas Stuart, eighteenth earl of Moray; they had a daughter and a son. In 1982 they were divorced and in the same year Boxer married the television newscaster Anna Ford, daughter of John Ford, Church of England clergyman. They had two daughters. Boxer died of a brain tumour on 20 July 1988 at his home, 1 Upper Butts, Brentford, London. He was cremated at Mortlake cemetery, London, and his ashes were scattered at King's College, Cambridge.<br>
