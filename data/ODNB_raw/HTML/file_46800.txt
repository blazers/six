</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bythell,  John Kenworthy</span>  (1840&#150;1916), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 20 April 1840 at 83 Great Jackson Street, Hulme, Manchester, the son of James Bythell, a calenderer and maker-up employed in the city's shipping trade, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Southell. He joined the merchant firm of Gaddum &amp; Co. and served from 1864 as resident partner in Bombay during the cotton boom induced by the American Civil War. There he acquired a thorough knowledge of the links between commerce, shipping, railways, and ports. He became a prime mover in the construction of the great harbour works of the port and was elected chairman of the Bombay chamber of commerce in 1872, returning home in 1875.<br>
<br>In 1886 Bythell became a founder member of the Manchester Ship Canal consultative committee and was converted by a study of the evidence from disbelief in the project to faith in its practicality. He agreed to join the board of the canal company if Daniel Adamson, the original promoter whose financial competence was now being questioned, ceased to be chairman. On 19 February 1887 Adamson resigned, and Bythell became a director, as well as chairman of the finance committee. On 20 July 1894 he was elected chairman in succession to Lord Egerton of Tatton (1832&#150;1909). As such he became the first paid, resident, and full-time chief executive officer in the history of the company, which was the largest business firm in the region. Bythell assumed office six months after the opening of the canal to traffic and did so at a critical juncture in its affairs, created by the bitter opposition of Liverpool, by the formation of hostile shipping conferences, by the unanticipated reduction of railway rates, and by the lack of essential warehousing facilities. He averted bankruptcy by using the revenues generated by the Bridgwater Canal and by persuading Manchester corporation to levy from 1896 a special ship canal rate. He attracted trade by extending the port's facilities, by encouraging their use by means of a special &#145;promotional tariff&#146;, and by avoiding conflict with potential clients. Through negotiation with his friends among the Hindu merchants of Bombay he secured the conclusion of the vital contract of 29 December 1894 for the shipment of piece-goods direct from Manchester to Bombay. He extended the functions of the ship canal company far outside the normal range of a port authority. In particular he encouraged the formation of a clutch of companies intended to provide the necessary facilities and to attract traffic to the port, especially the Manchester Cotton Association (1894), the Manchester Ship Canal Warehousing Company Ltd (1895), and Manchester Liners Ltd (1898).<br>
<br>Bythell's talents were primarily those of a merchant, a financier, and a diplomat. His unresting activity helped to raise Manchester from the status of the sixteenth port of the kingdom in 1894 to that of the fourth in 1906. Manchester ranked second in the export of cotton yarn from 1894 and second in the export of piece-goods from 1895. It became the second largest importer of raw cotton from 1896 and the second largest importer of petroleum from 1903. Bythell established a permanent partnership with the local corporation in 1904 at the price of conceding to it a perpetual majority upon the board of directors. He was primarily responsible for the development of the Port of Manchester, translating a legal concept and an engineering achievement into a commercial reality. He shattered Liverpool's historic monopoly and crowned his career by paying a first dividend, for the year 1915, to his loyal ordinary shareholders.<br>
<br>A Manchester Scot by origin, a Liberal in politics, and a Presbyterian in religion, Bythell devoted all his energies to business and lived entirely for the ship canal, becoming its &#145;second founder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 19 Aug 1916, 6). He did not become a director of other companies save as a representative of the canal company, serving from 1889 on the board of the Manchester chamber of commerce and from 1897 on that of the Manchester Dry Docks Company Ltd, established in 1891. He guided the destiny of the company for twenty-two years and retired in 1916, having throughout his life shunned all personal publicity and declined all national honours. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1909, aged seventy-six. Bythell died at Fernhill, Singleton Road, Broughton, Salford, on 18 August 1916 and was buried at Kensal church, Salford, on 22 August.<br>
