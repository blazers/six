<span class="headword">Latham,  James</span>  (1696&#150;1746), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, born in co. Tipperary, was a member of a Tipperary family living near Cashel. The head of the family, Oliver Latham of Meldrum, was appointed commissioner of oaths by the second duke of Ormond in 1695, a fact which leads to the earliest attributable portraits by Latham&#151;of James Butler of Ballyricken, then the head of the Ormond family in Ireland, and his brother Christopher, Roman Catholic archbishop of Cashel (both <i>c</i>.1718&#150;<i>c</i>.1720, Kilkenny Castle, co. Kilkenny). No evidence exists of Latham's early education but these portraits, if somewhat crude, show many of the qualities which were to make him a most distinguished painter. In the Ormond collection of paintings in Kilkenny Castle he had an important source for study and in 1724 he is recorded as visiting Antwerp, studying for one term in the Guild of St Luke and becoming a master of the guild. Whether he went via Paris or London is not certainly known, but it is likely that he visited both cities. He settled in Dublin in 1725.<br>
<br>Despite his merits Latham's work was quickly forgotten, and the oval head and shoulders of Bishop Berkeley (Trinity College, Dublin) was until recently his only remembered work. It was engraved by John Brooks without a publication date. Several other works were engraved, including the whole-length portrait of Eaton Stannard and that of Charles Tottenham (both National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), as well as likenesses of Sir John Ligonier (mezzotint by J. Brooks) and Patrick Quin (mezzotint by Andrew Miller). <span class="italic">Colonel Charles Janure de la Bouchti&egrave;re</span> (Ulster Museum, Belfast), a portrait of a Huguenot officer, must date before the sitter's death in 1731 and is a splendid character study of this soldier. Latham's finest portraits were done for the Cosby family, who owned four three-quarter lengths: of Pole Cosby and his daughter Sarah, his wife with their son Dudley, another of Sarah as a child, and one of her with her parrot after her marriage. There were a further two pictures of Dudley Cosby: one, much damaged, as a baby; and another as a child, which has been cut at the bottom edge and shows a strong French influence (all ex Sothebys, 11 July 1984, lot 38; 20 November 1985, lots 36, 85, 39; and 14 March 1990, lot 49). These pictures must have been painted over a ten-year period and show that love of children revealed in all Latham's child portraits, including the one of Bishop Berkeley's son (ex Sothebys, 2 June 1995, lot 201). They are delightful character studies; Pole Cosby's gesture, for instance, holding his daughter's hand, shows how much she meant to him. Latham put on his paint with firm direct strokes; his flair for colour is displayed in Sarah Cosby's beautiful pink dress as she offers her parrot cherries, or in the magnificent waistcoats of such sitters in the 1740s as Sir Capel Molyneux (Tate collection), but he is equally at home with the silvery tones in the portrait of the fourth earl of Inchiquin (priv. coll.), in which the sitter is wearing the insignia and ribbon of the Order of the Bath. Besides the Cosby groups Latham painted a number of double portraits, including the Leslie sisters playing the harpsichord (priv. coll.) and Bishop Clayton and his wife (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). His beautiful brushwork with its contrasting delicacy and breadth, seen in his rendering of sparkling braids or the soft density of a powdered wig, lifts Latham above the level of more humdrum contemporaries.<br>
<br>According to his will, dated 1 January 1746, Latham was married to a woman named Joane and had four daughters, Elinor, Margaret, Anne, and Mary, and one son, James. He was living in Trinity Lane, Dublin, when he died in 1746.<br>
