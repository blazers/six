<span class="headword">Comyn, Sir  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Sir John Comyn the Competitor, Red Comyn]</span>, lord of Badenoch  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1302), <span class="occ">magnate and claimant to the Scottish throne</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6044/', "John Comyn (d. c.1277)")</script> and his first wife, Eva. Between about 1270 and 1275, he married Eleanor (called Marjory in Scottish sources), sister of John de Balliol [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John")</script>], the future king of Scots, and he was also brother-in-law to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49385/', "Alexander MacDougall, lord of Argyll (d. 1310)")</script>, making a formidable Comyn&#150;MacDougall alliance in the north. John Comyn inherited the headship of the Comyns' senior, Badenoch, branch and became the second Red Comyn. His landed power included: Badenoch and Lochaber, with chief castles at Ruthven, Lochindorb, and Inverlochy; influence in Atholl, possibly including the castle at Blair Atholl; Bedrule and Scraesburgh, Roxburghshire; Dalswinton, with its castle, in Dumfriesshire; Findogask and Ochtertyre in Perthshire; Machan in the Clyde valley; and Lenzie and Kirkintilloch in Dunbartonshire after his brother William's death (after <i>c</i>.1290). He also had charge of the castles of Jedburgh and Clunie from Alexander III; and in England he had Tarset and Thornton in Tynedale, Northumberland, and Ulseby in Lincolnshire. He was religious patron to Inchaffray, Cambuskenneth, and Coupar Angus abbeys.<br>
<br>John Comyn was knighted by Alexander III in 1270, and was present in the royal circle at Selkirk in 1276. He swore to observe the marriage settlement between Margaret, Alexander III's daughter, and King Erik of Norway at Roxburgh in 1281, and in 1284 acknowledged the child of this marriage, Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as heir presumptive to Alexander III. When Alexander III died in 1286, Comyn was elected one of the six &#145;guardians&#146; of the realm. He was chosen, according to John Fordun, as one of three guardians from south of the Forth, though his power was probably greater in the north. As guardian, Comyn was active in government business at Edinburgh (principally), Roxburgh, Haddington, Stirling, Perth, and Berwick between 1287 and 1291. In 1289 the guardians sent him, together with Robert (V) Brus (<i>d</i>. 1295) and the bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, to negotiate with the English king's representative concerning the return of the Maid of Norway to Scotland, and Comyn was among the prelates and barons who confirmed the resulting treaty of Birgham in July 1290. By then John Comyn, as one of four surviving guardians, had become head of a Comyn &#145;party&#146;, following the death of his great-uncle and fellow guardian, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6042/', "Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan")</script>, in 1289. He was responsible, in 1290, for informing Edward I about the arrival of the Maid of Norway in Orkney, and in the same year was paid &pound;100 out of &pound;200, of the king's gift.<br>
<br>After the Maid's death in Orkney (October 1290), Comyn himself became one of thirteen &#145;competitors&#146; for the Scottish throne, though his brother-in-law, John de Balliol, and Robert (V) Brus were the two strongest candidates [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93692', "Competitors for the throne of Scotland")</script>]. Comyn claimed descent from Donald III (<i>d</i>. 1099?), whose granddaughter Hextilda (married to the Richard Comyn who died in 1178) was the mother of John's great-grandfather. Comyn's claim significantly stated that he would not prejudice the claims of Balliol, his brother-in-law. He had already shown strong support for Balliol, and the list of Balliol's forty auditors was dominated by Comyn family and supporters. Indeed, in 1290&#150;91 the &#145;appeal of the seven earls&#146; accused John Comyn, with Bishop William Fraser of St Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1297), of trying to make Balliol king by a &#145;coup&#146;. Comyn's claim, soon withdrawn and dismissed in the final judgment (17 November 1292), was, no doubt, intended to safeguard a possible future bid after Balliol became king in 1292. The failure of the Balliol line could have given Comyn's descendants through Eleanor de Balliol a double claim.<br>
<br>Under Balliol's kingship, John Comyn naturally figured prominently in Scottish politics and when, by 1295, King John's leadership had proved ineffective, John Comyn was one of the council of twelve elected to take government out of John's hands. In 1295 he was sent to France to negotiate a treaty which was ratified in 1296, and after John renounced Edward I's overlordship in the latter year, Comyn was regarded as the English king's enemy and his Northumberland lands were confiscated. After the Scottish defeat at Dunbar, Comyn made submission at Montrose in July 1296 and was sent into exile with his family to the English king's manor of Geddington, where he was allowed to hunt fox, hare, and wild cat in the royal forest. Following the outbreak of revolt in Scotland under William Wallace, Comyn was sent by Edward I in 1297 to bring order to Scotland. He was commanded to assist Brian Fitzalan in the custody of the kingdom, and especially to defend the castle at Roxburgh; and he was also instructed to quell the rising in Moray, but appears soon to have joined the Scots, because late in 1297 his Tynedale lands were to be taken again into the king's hands. It is probable that Comyn contributed cavalry to the Scottish army at Falkirk in 1298, as Fordun reports that &#145;the Comyns&#146; envied Wallace and deserted the Scottish army at the battle. But that it was John's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6046/', "John Comyn the younger (d. 1306)")</script>, who was chosen guardian with Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, the future king, in 1298, suggests that John Comyn the elder was either too ill or unfit for office, or possibly discredited. He died, <i>c</i>.1302, at his castle of Lochindorb and was succeeded by his son, John, who married Joan de Valence, cousin of the English king.<br>
