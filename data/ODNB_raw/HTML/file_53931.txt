<span class="headword">Godley,  John Robert</span>  (1814&#150;1861), <span class="occ">colonial administrator and political reformer in New Zealand</span>, the eldest son of John Godley of Killegar, co. Leitrim, and his wife, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Daly, was born on 29 May 1814, probably in Dublin. He was educated at Harrow School, and from 1832 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he proceeded BA on 27 October 1836. Deeply religious and committed to social tradition, Godley was sympathetic to the Oxford Movement, which was developing at the time. He was called to the Irish bar in 1839, but practised little, if at all. He travelled in North America in 1842, and developed there further his interest in systematic colonization and self-government. His observations were published in his <span class="italic">Letters from America</span> (2 vols., 1844). During his subsequent service as poor law commissioner and high sheriff from 1843 in co. Leitrim he unsuccessfully proposed state-funded mass emigration of Irish to Canada to alleviate the devastation of the potato famine. On 29 September 1846 he married <a href="#cosubject_53931">Charlotte Griffith Wynne (1821&#150;1907) [<i>see below</i>]</a> of Foelas, Denbighshire, Wales; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1847 Godley began collaborating with the like-minded Edward Gibbon Wakefield on a scheme for organized settlement in New Zealand. The resulting <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93787', "Canterbury Association")</script> first met in London on 27 March 1848, and land was purchased from the New Zealand Company, which also advanced funds in support of the venture. Godley proposed a scheme which provided for funds to be allocated out of the proceeds of land sales for the religious and educational needs of the community to be established. The association's aspiration would be described a century later by L. C. Webb as being &#145;to create in New Zealand a society of which the nexus was a common religious faith strong enough to resist those forces which in the Old World were breaking the ties of social obligation&#146;  (Webb, 226).<br>
<br>A site was selected at the Port Cooper (Lyttelton) plains, with the main town to be named Christchurch, and preparations began for the religious and secular development of the settlement. In December 1849, beset by ill health, Godley left with his family for New Zealand aboard the <i>Lady Nugent</i>, having been appointed chief agent of the Canterbury Association. He was based in Wellington while awaiting the arrival of the first immigrant ships in December 1850, and he involved himself in the Colonial Reform League and continued his advocacy of self-government. His view of colonial management he stated briefly and emphatically: &#145;I would rather be governed by a Nero on the spot than by a board of angels in London, because we could, if the worst came to the worst, cut off Nero's head, but we could not get at the board in London at all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 18).<br>
<br>Godley's pragmatic oversight of the earliest development of systematic settlement in Canterbury brought him into conflict with the association, particularly over the leasing of pastoral lands in what had originally been presumed would be a small-scale agriculture-based economy. The association had stalled with Godley's departure from London: Wakefield reported that &#145;the affair lost its soul and body when it lost Godley, who both thought and acted for everybody&#146;  (Webb, 160). Initially slow land sales threatened the economic viability of the settlement and further loans (including from Godley) were required to keep the venture afloat. By now he had been appointed resident magistrate and commissioner of crown lands by the governor, George Grey, and Godley's struggle over the terms for pastoral leases prompted him to tender his resignation to the association in June 1851, his position being, he reported, &#145;too false and too painful to be endurable&#146;  (ibid., 199). He continued in the post, however, until the passing of the <span class="roman">New Zealand Constitution Act</span> in June 1852 opened the way for Canterbury to become a self-governing province. In December of that year he departed for England with his family, despite a petition urging him to stand for election as superintendent of the new provincial government. He later wrote &#145;I shall never, as long as I live, cease to condemn myself for leaving New Zealand&#146;  (ibid., 208). James Edward FitzGerald, the first superintendent of Canterbury Province, wrote that, by the time of his departure, &#145;Godley was in all but the name, the governor of the settlement which he originated and formed&#146;  (ibid., 209). FitzGerald edited a selection from Godley's writings and speeches which was published in 1863: extracts from his letters to C. B. Adderley were published in the same year. A statue of Godley was erected in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, in 1867.<br>
<br>On his return to England Godley continued to write on colonial reform and acted on immigration matters as an agent of the Canterbury provincial government. Following an appointment as commissioner of income tax in Ireland, he was from 1855 assistant under-secretary at the War Office under the secretaryships of Lord Panmure, General Peel, and Lord Herbert. In this post he continued to advocate self-reliance for colonies in the arena of imperial defence policy. He died of tubercular consumption at his home in Gloucester Place, Portman Square, on 17 November 1861. <a name="cosubject_53931"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Godley</span>  (1821&#150;1907)<span class="occ"></span>, his wife, born probably at Foelas in Denbighshire, the daughter of Charles Wynne Griffith Wynne and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hildyard, was a keen participant in and observer of colonial life. Her <span class="italic">Letters from Early New Zealand</span>, written to her mother between 1850 and 1853 and first published for private circulation only in 1936, were published in 1951 and revealed her talent for description of people, places, and social mores. The <span class="italic">Letters</span> are an important and often quoted source of insight into upper-class colonial society in New Zealand, and bear witness to her support and involvement in her husband's work. She died at Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, on 3 January 1907. Their only son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33436/', "John Arthur Godley (1847&#150;1932)")</script>, permanent under-secretary of state for India and first Baron Kilbracken.<br>
