<span class="headword">Barry,  Charles Robert</span>  (1823&#150;1897), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 3 January 1823, the eldest son of James Barry, a solicitor in Limerick, and his wife, Ellen Purcell. Educated at Dalton's School, Limerick, and Midleton College, co. Cork, he matriculated for Trinity College, Dublin, in 1840, graduated BA there in 1845, and proceeded MA in 1862. His career in Trinity, in one critic's view, did not show &#145;any very brilliant academical distinctions in his favour, a fact which seems to show that Barry was in his youth &hellip; indisposed to undergo any great exertion for anything&#146;  (Rhadamanthus, 43). Having entered King's Inns in 1841 and Lincoln's Inn two years later, Barry was called to the Irish bar in 1848, after which he joined the Munster circuit, where he was soon to serve as crown prosecutor. In 1855 he married Kate (<i>d</i>. 1886), the daughter of David Fitzgerald of Dublin. They had two sons. Four years later he was made a QC at the early age of thirty-six, and from 1859 to 1865 he was crown prosecutor for Dublin.<br>
<br>Barry sat as Liberal MP for Dungarvan, co. Waterford, 1865&#150;8. Also in 1865 he became law adviser to Dublin Castle and was later to have carriage of the investigation that preceded the trial of Charles Kickham, James Stephens, and other Fenians. As a result, Barry incurred a degree of political odium. Barry's close ties with the Liberal Party assisted his further advancement: he became third serjeant in 1866, solicitor-general for Ireland in 1868, when Gladstone formed his administration, and attorney-general in 1870&#151;this last elevation leading to his being sworn of the Irish privy council. Barry helped to frame the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of 1870.<br>
<br>Barry, a Roman Catholic, was appointed a puisne judge of the Irish court of queen's bench in January 1872. As an assize judge for the north-western circuit, Barry shortly thereafter presided at the first and second retrials of Sub-Inspector Montgomery of the Royal Irish Constabulary for murder. On 19 June 1871 Glass, the cashier at the Newtownstewart, co. Tyrone, branch of the Northern Bank was found murdered with a fractured skull and a slit in one of his ears. Montgomery, the senior policeman in the district, was called in to investigate, only eventually to emerge as the prime suspect himself: Montgomery had been in financial straits and had stolen &pound;1605 from the bank, money which, together with a billhook identified as the principal murder weapon and a pruning knife, was found in a nearby wood. Montgomery's trial proved abortive as did the first retrial before Barry. The second, however, produced a conviction, following which Montgomery blurted out in court a belief in his own insanity and a strange tale of his having been drugged and poisoned. Barry was unimpressed and there was no reprieve: Barry, it was claimed, &#145;never hesitated to hang a man for whom hanging has appeared to be the correct remedy&#146;  (Rhadamanthus, 43). The case is featured in Denis Johnston's radio play <span class="italic">Murder at Newtownstewart</span> (1937), also known as <span class="italic">Murder hath no Tongue</span>.<br>
<br>On the death of Lord Justice Deasy, Barry, in 1883, was promoted to fill the vacancy on the Irish court of appeal. It is hard to accept the view propounded by &#145;Rhadamanthus&#146; that the translation brought no benefit to Barry's reputation. In 1892, in <i>Delany</i> v. <i>Dublin United Tramways</i>, Barry dissented from his colleagues, but it was this dissent that won over a later court of appeal in a similar case in 1920. Delany, who was drunk, had attempted to board a moving tram. The conductor had sought to prevent this without instructing his driver to halt the tram. In the process Delany sustained serious injuries. The court of appeal majority considered that there was no case to answer and that the matter should have been withdrawn from the jury. Not so Barry: &#145;Take the case of a stowaway. Is the captain entitled to throw him overboard? Or to put him in the dinghy, and cut him adrift?&#146;. In <i>Agnew</i> v. <i>Belfast Banking Co.</i> in 1896 Barry participated in the hearing of the appeal in the case of a woman who, while contemplating suicide, had sought to make a valid <i>donatio mortis causa</i> (a gift made in contemplation of death). Barry's short concurring judgment, agreeing that no valid <i>donatio</i> had occurred, focused on the interpretation of a critical clause in Justinian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>: it reads like an advanced Latin seminar.<br>
<br>In 1878 Barry was appointed to the commission chaired by Mr Justice Stephen to revise the criminal code. From 1880 he served as a senator of the Royal University of Ireland; and from September to December 1883 he was a joint commissioner of the Irish great seal. Barry died suddenly at his home, 3 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, on 15 May 1897, and was buried in Limerick three days later in the family plot in St Laurence's cemetery.<br>
<br>Barry was &#145;a man of extraordinarily natural ability&#146; who came to enjoy &#145;a popularity that has never been exceeded&#146;  (Ball, 2.305). He could &#145;tell you the winners of the Derby for many a year back, and probably make not a half-bad guess at the winner for the next&#146;  (Rhadamanthus, 44). &#145;He dresses, as a rule, with an attention to fashion that is unusual in an Irishman of his profession&#146;  (ibid., 43). Rhadamanthus added another pleasing and evocative cameo: Barry, he wrote,<blockquote>owns a fine red setter dog, which follows him to court, calls for him at four o'clock, takes him to the club, and generally behaves with such fascinating canine grace and good temper as to make himself the popular favourite everywhere that his master's dog should be. (ibid., 43&#150;4)</blockquote>
