<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morgan,  Godfrey Charles</span>, Viscount Tredegar  (1831&#150;1913), <span class="occ">soldier and landowner</span>, was born at Ruperra Castle, Glamorgan, on 28 April 1831, the second son of Sir Charles Morgan Robinson Morgan (1792&#150;1875), MP for Brecon Borough for three periods between 1812 and 1847 and heir to the Tredegar estate, who inherited in 1846 and in 1859 became first Baron Tredegar, and his wife, Rosamund Mundy (<i>d</i>. 1883). Educated at Eton College until 1848, he was commissioned in 1849 into the 17th lancers, rising to lieutenant in 1850 and captain in 1853. By the time he set sail for the war with Russia in the Crimea his elder brother, Charles Rodney (1828&#150;1854), had died, leaving him heir. As the third son, Frederick (1834&#150;1909), also saw action in the Crimean campaign as a captain in the rifle brigade, the Morgan family faced the possibility of losing their three eldest sons within a year.<br>
<br>As a troop leader Morgan took part in the charge of the light brigade at the battle of Balaklava on 25 October 1854, and was one of two officers from the regiment to return unscathed. Falling ill and &#145;heartily sick of &hellip; fearful scenes of carnage and bloodshed&#146;  (letter to his mother, 7 Nov 1854, NL Wales, Tredegar Park muniments), he was removed to Scutari before being gazetted out of the army in January 1855 and returning home. He brought with him his charger, Sir Briggs, who lived until 1874 and is buried in Tredegar Park. He enjoyed lifelong fame as a Balaklava survivor, commemorating the battle at anniversary dinners, and served as major in the Royal Gloucestershire yeomanry (1856&#150;75), honorary colonel of the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers, and president of the Monmouth Territorial Force Association.<br>
<br>In December 1858 Morgan was elected unopposed as Conservative MP for the county of Brecon, and remained in the Commons until the death of his father in 1875, whereupon he ascended to the House of Lords. Returned unopposed in 1859, 1865, and 1868, he defeated his Liberal opponent William Fuller-Maitland comfortably in the general election of 1874, although Fuller-Maitland took the seat in the ensuing by-election. As Lord Tredegar he remained &#145;naturally Conservative&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wit and Wisdom</span>, 84), if favourable to women's suffrage, and served as president of the south Monmouthshire and the Newport Conservative associations but rarely attended parliament. Public service was instead focused locally: as lord lieutenant of Monmouthshire and of Brecknockshire, as a magistrate for Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, and as a county councillor, alderman, and chairman (1902&#150;3) of Monmouthshire county council.<br>
<br>On the death of his father Morgan had inherited a substantial landed estate with significant industrial and commercial interests. Most of the estate was in Monmouthshire, with lesser holdings in adjacent Brecknockshire and Glamorgan. As a landlord he enjoyed a reputation for generosity and solicitude towards his tenants. At times of agricultural depression he issued rent rebates of between 10 and 20 per cent and drew praise from witnesses to the 1894 royal commission on the land in Wales and Monmouthshire. He took a strong interest in the promotion of new agricultural methods, continuing the Tredegar agricultural show and breeding livestock and shire horses at Tredegar Park, and was president of the Smithfield Club, the Bath and West Society, the Royal Agricultural Society, the Shire Horse Society, and the Hackney Horse Society.<br>
<br>Tredegar was chairman of Newport's Alexandra Docks Company and of the town's chamber of commerce, hailing the port's potential as &#145;a second Liverpool&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wit and Wisdom</span>, 148). He also played a part in the development of the city of Cardiff. He frequently made gifts of land for the building of churches (both Anglican and nonconformist), schools, libraries, hospitals, and parks. Major benefactions include the sites of the university college in Cardiff, the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, and the Newport athletic grounds. All told, his public benefactions were estimated to amount to &pound;40,000 annually  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 12 March 1913).<br>
<br>A keen sportsman, in his younger days Morgan was an accomplished steeplechaser and cricketer. For forty years he was master of the Tredegar hunt, and he also took a strong interest in bowls, fishing, grouse shooting, hockey, &#145;and any and every manly sport&#146;  (Hughes, 142). In later life he developed an interest in archaeology and antiquarianism, serving as president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association. He perpetuated his family's commitment to Welsh cultural activities through sponsoring eisteddfodau, dressing as Owain Glyn D&#373;r for the National Pageant of Wales in 1909, and stressing Monmouthshire's essentially Welsh character.<br>
<br>Raised to the viscountcy in December 1905, Tredegar was the subject of further local tributes in his closing years. Almost 7000 subscribed to a Monmouthshire testimonial to him prompted by &#145;the treatment of your tenants during agricultural depression&#146;  (<span class="italic">Viscount Tredegar: his Life and Work</span>, 8), and in 1909 he was given the freedom of the boroughs of Newport and Cardiff. Through his philanthropy and patronage of local societies Tredegar was in demand as an after-dinner speaker and &#145;inveterate bazaar opener&#146;  (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 12 March 1913). He calculated that, in laying foundation stones, he had amassed a collection of trowels and mallets sufficient to equip every parish church in England  (<span class="italic">Wit and Wisdom</span>, 15&#150;16), and developed a reputation for amusing and enlightening speeches, which often drew on his passion for poetry (favourites being Wordsworth, Kipling, and, of course, Tennyson). He was labelled the &#145;Mark Twain of Wales&#146;  (Harries, 42). In 1911 the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> published a collection, <span class="italic">Wit and Wisdom of Lord Tredegar</span>, with illustrations by J. M. Staniforth.<br>
<br>Tredegar had been engaged to be married when he left for the Crimea, but his fianc&eacute;e married another man during his absence. He remained a lifelong bachelor, living alone and unostentatiously in the very ostentatious Tredegar House, where he resisted such innovations as gas and electric lighting, the telephone, and motor cars. He died there of influenza on 11 March 1913, and was buried in the family mausoleum at St Basil's Church, Bassaleg, on 14 March. His death prompted extensive public appreciation of &#145;the Grand Old Man of the Principality&#146;  (<span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span>, 12 March 1913), although the subtitle of another volume dedicated to him, &#145;Soldier, Peer, Public Benefactor and Humorist&#146;, is equally apt. The viscountcy became extinct, and the barony and baronetcy passed to his nephew, Courtenay Charles Evan Morgan (1867&#150;1934). The house of Tredegar would never again enjoy such prosperity and renown, nor exert such influence in the affairs of south Wales.<br>
