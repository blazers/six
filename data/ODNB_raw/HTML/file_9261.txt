<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fell,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584, <em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">dean of Christ Church, Oxford</span>, was baptized at St Clement Danes, London, on 3 May 1584, the son of Hugh Fell, citizen and barber&#150;surgeon. Educated at Westminster School, he was elected a Westminster scholar of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1601, matriculating as a gentleman on 20 November of that year. He graduated BA on 27 June 1605 and proceeded MA on 30 May 1608.<br>
<br>Fell rapidly became a competent man of business. He was commissioned to write personalized Latin letters to great men soliciting benefactions for rebuilding the university's schools from 1612, and was elected proctor for the year 1614 to 1615. He became a canon of St Paul's, London, on 29 January 1613, and in 1615 obtained the rectory of Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, which he ceded to Dean William Goodwin of Christ Church in 1617, receiving in its place that of Freshwater, Isle of Wight. Having had an advance presentation from the king to a canonry of Christ Church by 1610, he was installed on 11 May 1619, about which time he was appointed a chaplain-in-ordinary to James I. He advanced academically in tandem with his preferments, proceeding BD on 23 November 1615 and DD on 23 June 1619. In the following years he obtained two Berkshire rectories, Longworth in 1621 and Sunningwell in 1625. He continued as a royal chaplain under Charles I.<br>
<br>Fell married in 1624 Margaret, daughter of Thomas Wyld, of the Commandery, Worcester. Several sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9257/', "John Fell (1625&#150;1686)")</script>, later also dean of Christ Church and bishop of Oxford, and a number of daughters were born to the couple. Fell was elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity on 8 August 1626, in the vice-chancellorship of William Juxon with whom he had good relations. He procured letters patent on 5 July 1627 attaching to his chair a canonry of Worcester, where Juxon was now dean, and was installed at the next vacancy on 20 May 1629. In the same year royal letters to Bishop Thornborough recommended him to the vacant archdeaconry of Worcester, but the bishop installed his own son. In 1628 Fell purchased from Sir John Coke, secretary of state, whose many favours he later acknowledged, the estate of Hall Court, Herefordshire. Fell became master of St Oswald's Hospital, Worcester, in 1631.<br>
<br>Negotiating biennial election according to statute, Fell continued for nearly twelve years as Lady Margaret professor. He contributed Latin poems to collective university and college volumes, mainly celebrating royal occasions, but otherwise published only a professorial address and a sermon, <span class="italic">Primitiae, sive, Oratio habita Oxoniae in schola theologica nono Novembris, et concio latina ad baccalaureos die cinerum</span>, in 1627. In the address he claimed the professor should fight the sworn enemies of the church, including the reigning Antichrist, the raging Jesuit and the plotting Pelagian.<br>
<br>That Fell published no more suggests his theological position was out of favour, like that of the Calvinist regius professor, John Prideaux, with whom he avoided clashes. He certainly escaped association with those frequently attacked as Arminians in Oxford. Anthony Wood's assertion that he abandoned his early Calvinism and &#145;became, after great seekings and cringings a creature of Dr Laud archbishop of Canterbury&#146;  (Wood, 3.243) is inadequate. Fell wrote to Bishop Laud in 1628 deferentially and with gratitude for favours received, when investigating a suspect vestry in Abingdon, Berkshire, for the bishop, but there is no evidence that he substantially altered his theology to cultivate Laud. By 1637 Laud was negotiating Fell's resignation and replacement by the more congenial anti-Calvinist Thomas Lawrence, master of Balliol. Fell's appointment to the rectory of Stow on the Wold and the deanery of Lichfield in that year may have been part of a package. On 13 October Fell asked Sir John Coke to move Laud, through Lord Treasurer Juxon, to grant him the see of Rochester, but without success. His expectations probably moved him, alongside the reluctant Prideaux, to certify the orthodoxy of William Chillingworth's answer to Edward Knott, the Jesuit, on 14 October 1637. Fell drove a hard bargain, and rumour reached Thomas Crosfield that he wished to make over his professorship, with canonry attached, to his son-in-law, Washburne, and &#145;so make it a portion w[i]th his daughter&#146;  (Queen's College, MS 390, fol. 177<i>r</i>). He resigned on 10 March 1638, to be succeeded by Thomas Lawrence, and became dean of Christ Church on 28 June.<br>
<br>In 1631 Laud, as chancellor, had reproved Fell, alongside Prideaux, for neglecting lectures. The new dean received several severe reprimands in 1639. As promoter of a new examination for the bachelor of arts degree Laud was incensed by Fell's re-examining of Christ Church men after the public exercise. He wrote again calling him &#145;a sudden, hasty, and weak man, and most unlike a man that understands government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.224) for contempt of proctorial and vice-chancellorial jurisdiction in a disciplinary matter affecting a Christ Church man. Fell's &#145;desire of popularity and pleasing boyes&#146; had already been noticed in 1634 by Christopher Potter, provost of Queen's College  (Queen's College, MS 390, fol. 175<i>v</i>). Laud also censured Fell over defective cathedral services.<br>
<br>Fell continued to develop administrative and building skills. Even before he became dean he had assisted his predecessor Dean Brian Duppa's improvements to Christ Church buildings; Christopher Potter had commended him in 1634 for his<blockquote>skill in contrivance of building. The Deane of Christ Ch[urch] knew not how to have proceeded but for him: he hath builded upon his own charges at his two parsonages, &amp; at Worcester assisted the B[isho]p of Lond[on] th[a]t is. (Queen's College, MS 390, fol. 175<i>v</i>)</blockquote>As dean he commenced the north range of Tom quad and created the great fan-vaulted staircase. His business competence was recognized in April 1633 when he was first-named university delegate for the press, with a view to printing the Bodleian Library's Greek manuscripts.<br>
<br>On the break between king and parliament Fell established himself as Oxford's leading royalist. He took the 1642 protestation only with reservations. His arrest was ordered by parliament in July 1642 and he absented himself from Oxford. Lord Saye and Sele railed against him during his occupation of Oxford in September. Fell returned with other royalists in December, surrendering his lodgings to the king during the war. The new chancellor, Hertford, nominated him vice-chancellor in 1645. Following Hertford's flight from Oxford in 1646 before another nomination he remained <i>de facto</i> vice-chancellor until 1648.<br>
<br>In this office Fell led resistance after the parliamentary victory. He worked with Gerard Langbaine, keeper of the archives, to protect printing privileges acquired through Laud&#151;an interest inherited by his son, John Fell&#151;and pressed for tenants to pay arrears in rents. Having refused to appear before the parliamentary visitors on 29 September 1647, Fell was taken into custody and called before the committee of parliament on 15 November. Returning to Oxford he ignored orders to quit his lodgings. Eventually soldiers under the newly imposed chancellor, Pembroke, removed Margaret Fell and her children on 12 April 1648. Fell retired to Sunningwell, where he was unmolested, although he had been sequestered from Longworth in 1647. He died at Sunningwell on 1 or 2 February 1649, reportedly of shock on hearing of the king's execution, and was buried there.<br>
