<span class="headword">Grant,  Isabel Frances <span class="st"> [Elsie]</span></span>  (1887&#150;1983), <span class="occ">promoter of Scottish Gaelic culture and writer</span>, was born on 21 July 1887 at 34 Melville Street, Edinburgh, the eldest of the six children of Colonel Hugh Gough Grant CB (1845&#150;1922), of the 78th and Seaforth Highlanders, and his wife, Isabel Mackintosh (1864&#150;1960) of Balnespick. Isabel Grant, known familiarly from childhood as Elsie, was brought up in London and in the north of Scotland, particularly at Muchalls in Kincardineshire, details of which she was to recall in later writings. Her parents went to India when she was young, leaving her in London in the care of her grandfather Field Marshal Sir Patrick Grant, governor of Chelsea Hospital and gold stick-in-waiting to Queen Victoria, and with an unmarried aunt, Frances Gough Grant.<br>
<br>While living in London, Elsie Grant was educated privately with governesses; in the course of her education she frequently visited the British Museum, where she was inspired by the Elgin marbles and Greek and Roman sculpture. Although these were her earliest memories of museums, they were not her most formative ones. A visit to Stockholm and Oslo took her to the pioneering museum projects of Skansen in Sweden's Nordiska Museum and Norway's Sandvig collection at Lillehammer. Here the formal and conventional display of museum collections was combined with open-air collections of buildings and their contents, often moved from dispersed locations and re-erected on the site. The folk museum movement in Europe had grown in the 1870s out of the ideas and inspiration of the Swede Artur Hazelius, whose example had not been followed in Britain but whose work Elsie Grant admired. A visit to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1912 showed her how the staff of a European national museum studied and presented &#145;peasant culture&#146;, methods particularly exemplified in the costume gallery.<br>
<br>From these experiences Elsie Grant developed her vision of a museum for the highlands of Scotland which would preserve a fast disappearing material culture and its Gaelic traditions and values. While adopting these examples, she nevertheless maintained that the concept of a folk culture of peasant communities was inappropriate to the Scottish highlands; she argued that the Gaelic way of life should be seen as the survival of an ancient and aristocratic culture rather than of the primitive and unsophisticated. The springboard for her highland folk museum was the Highland Exhibition held in Inverness in 1930, after which some of the 2100 exhibits were retained or acquired for a &#145;national folk museum&#146;. This initiative failed to develop as envisaged but was carried forward by Elsie Grant personally when she used a legacy to purchase a building in Iona in which her folk museum was established in 1935. The collections soon outgrew this island site and the museum was moved to another property at Kingussie in Inverness-shire, where the museum, named Am Fasgadh (&#145;The Shelter&#146;), opened in 1944. It contained a unique wealth of highland and Hebridean artefacts, including domestic material and furniture, and the tools and implements of crofting and farming, demonstrating the distinctive identity of the material culture of highland history and also the rich variety evident between the regions and localities of a relatively small country. In addition she reconstructed four buildings on the site. The Highland Folk Museum was acquired for the four Scottish universities in 1954, when Elsie Grant decided to retire.<br>
<br>Elsie Grant was awarded the honorary degree of LLD by the University of Edinburgh in 1948 and the MBE in 1959. She was the author of more than a dozen books and a selection of articles, having developed her scholarly and critical faculties when working as a research assistant to J. M. Keynes during the First World War. This output included: her first and favourite work, <span class="italic">Everyday Life on an Old Highland Farm, 1769&#150;1782</span> (1922), which analysed the farm accounts of a highland tacksman, a vilified class whom she persuasively defended; her seminal <span class="italic">The Social and Economic Development of Scotland before 1603</span> (1930); and the intriguing <span class="italic">The Lordship of the Isles</span> (1935). All are major works which still hold their place on university reading lists.<br>
<br>Elsie Grant was a tall and commanding figure whose temperament and determination matched the impression of a large physique. When she retired to Edinburgh, her hospitable flat in Heriot Row became a convivial meeting-place for the many Scottish scholars, young and old, invited to her often challenging soir&eacute;es. She died, unmarried, at her home, Viewpoint, 22 Lennox Row, Edinburgh, on 19 September 1983, and her ashes were interred at Dalarossie, Strath Spey, on 25 September.<br>
