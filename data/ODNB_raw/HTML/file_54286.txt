<span class="headword">MacRuairi,  Ranald, of Garmoran</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1346), <span class="occ">chief of clan Ruairi</span>, was the illegitimate son of Ruairi MacRuairi (styled Ruairi of the Isles in contemporary documents) and a woman whose identity is unknown. Ranald's father was probably the MacRuairi r&iacute; Innse Gall (king of the Isles) who was noted in the annals of Ulster as dying alongside Edward Bruce, Robert I's brother, at the battle of Dundalk on 14 October 1318. Ranald's accession to the lordship of Garmoran, which embraced Moidart, Arisaig, Morar, and Knoydart on the mainland, along with the islands of Rum, Eigg, Barra, the Uists, and St Kilda, may have been contested after his father's death in 1318. Ruairi had received formal title to the lands which made up the lordship of Garmoran only after the resignation of the heir to these estates, his legitimate half-sister, Christina, some time in the reign of Robert I (<i>r</i>. 1306&#150;29). After Ruairi's death Christina made a further resignation of her rights in Garmoran, this time in favour of one Arthur Campbell. Despite Christina's grant and his own canonical illegitimacy, Ranald was undoubtedly accepted as the chief of clan Ruairi and the dominant lord in Garmoran after his father's death.<br>
<br>Ranald MacRuairi's earliest appearance in record sources dates from 1337, when, as Ranald, son of Ruairi of the Isles (Latinized as Reginald, son of Roderick of the Isles), he was noted as supporting attempts to obtain a papal dispensation for his sister Amy to marry John MacDonald, first lord of the Isles. At this point Ranald and his new brother-in-law were probably backing the claims of Edward Balliol to the Scottish throne against those of David II, the son and heir of Robert I. However, both men had been reconciled to David II by 12 June 1343, on which date Ranald received a general confirmation of his Garmoran lands from the king. Shortly before the royal grant, in July 1342, William, earl of Ross, gave over the west coast lands of Kintail to Ranald. The political and military expansion of the clan Ruairi into Kintail can probably be dated to the period after the death of William's father, Earl Hugh, at the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, when William was either a minor or, as some sources suggest, in exile outside the kingdom. In either case the 1342 grant in Ranald's favour seems to have been forced from a reluctant Earl William. That the relationship between the two men was far from cordial is confirmed by Ranald's assassination in Elcho Priory by adherents of Earl William during a muster of the Scottish host at Perth in October 1346.<br>
<br>Ranald MacRuairi seems to have had at least one brother, Hugh, who had a grant of the thanage of Glen Tilt in the period 1342&#150;6. After Ranald's death control of Garmoran passed to his sister's husband, John MacDonald, lord of the Isles. MacDonald continued to exercise lordship over Garmoran despite the end of his marriage to Amy MacRuairi, either through her death or through a divorce which in 1350 allowed John to marry Margaret Stewart, daughter of Robert the Steward (the future Robert II). On 9 March 1372 MacDonald received a grant of Garmoran from Robert II. In January 1373 the king confirmed John's grant of the Garmoran lands to Ranald, the eldest son of his marriage to Amy MacRuairi and the nephew of Ranald MacRuairi (after whom he was named).<br>
<br>From the sons of Amy and John descended the Clanranald and the Glengarry MacDonalds, who continued to dominate the island and mainland territories associated with the lordship of Garmoran. Fifteenth-century Gaelic genealogies suggest that Ranald MacRuairi had at least one illegitimate son; his descendants acted as the leaders of a kindred reduced to political and military dependence on the new MacDonald lords of Garmoran. That the MacRuairis remained a significant force within Garmoran is suggested by the appearance of an Alexander MacRuairi of Garmoran, who was arrested and executed on the orders of James I in 1428 and who was described by the chronicler Walter Bower as the chief of 1000 men.<br>
