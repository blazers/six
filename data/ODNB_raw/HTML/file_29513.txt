<span class="headword">Williams,  Jane</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Jane Williams Ysgafell]</span>  (1806&#150;1885), <span class="occ">historian and writer</span>, was born in Riley Street, Chelsea, London, on 1 February 1806, the second of seven children of David Williams and his wife, Eleanor Marsh (1781&#150;1851). Her father, who held an appointment at the Navy Office, was descended from Henry Williams (1624&#150;1684) of Ysgafell near Newton, Montgomeryshire, and was a friend and convert of leading Welsh puritan Vavasor Powell; it is from the old family estate at Ysgafell that Jane Williams takes the epithet that invariably accompanies her name. Little is known of her mother's family apart from its connection with Neuadd Felen, near Talgarth, Brecknockshire.<br>
<br>Very little is known concerning the education of Jane Williams, or how she came to develop her formidable intellectual and literary talents; but she enjoyed a happy and comfortable childhood in a home well endowed with books. Ill health seemed to dog her throughout life. As a young girl, she was sent to Talgarth for the fresh country air, and lived mainly at Neuadd Felen and briefly at Pipton Cottage, Pipton, near Glasbury-on-Wye. Here she acquired a knowledge of Welsh and a love of Welsh literature and history. Here, too, she became acquainted with the charismatic Augusta Hall, Lady Llanover. She became an intimate and valued member of Lady Llanover's literary circle, with its passion for Welsh learning and its romantic pursuit of old traditions.<br>
<br>Lady Llanover proved a generous and lifelong friend to Jane Williams, whose only income came from a small annuity, purchased with a legacy from her Marsh grandmother, and from what she earned from her writing. She managed her finances astutely, but when in 1856 she returned to London to live, she could only afford a series of rented rooms, mainly in Chelsea. She lived variously at 9 Hans Place, 38 Sydney Street, 40 Sydney Street, 56 Coleshill Street, and finally settled at 31 Oakley Crescent.<br>
<br>A delicate, fine-featured woman, Jane Williams was described some forty years after her death, in a local Brecknockshire history, as &#145;a distinguished lady of letters, whom some of us remember as a kindly and somewhat stately personage&#146;  (T. R. Phillips, ed., <span class="italic">The Breconshire Border</span>, 1926, 125). Temperamentally highly strung and tending in later life towards eccentricity, her intellectual abilities were considerable. Her writings, which are clear and often lively, demonstrate her research skills, analytical ability, keen powers of observation, and, despite ill health, enormous industry. Her achievements are all the more remarkable, given the inadequacies of women's education in the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Jane Williams's earliest publications include a volume of poetry, privately published when she was eighteen, and a collection of devotional essays. The main body of her work, however, reflects her two dominant concerns&#151;her deep interest in Welsh life and culture and a real concern with and recognition of the value of women's lives, both contemporary and historical. Her published response to the infamous parliamentary report on the state of education in Wales of 1847, which depicted the Welsh as drunken and ignorant and levied charges of immorality against the women of Wales, fused these interests: in <span class="italic">Artigall, or, Remarks on the reports of the commissioners of inquiry into the state of education in Wales</span>, published in Llandovery and London in 1848, she made a spirited defence of Welsh womanhood and systematically demolished the evidence, the research methodology, and even the English grammar of the commissioners.<br>
<br>Williams made two major, and many lesser, contributions to Welsh scholarship. She compiled <span class="italic">The Literary Remains of the Reverend Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc), with a Memoir of his Life</span>, published in two volumes in Llandovery in 1854&#150;5. It took her two years to sort out the &#145;mingled-mass of unsorted papers&#146; of this eminent Celtic scholar, eisteddfod enthusiast, and founder member of the Cymreigyddion. Her other epic research task was the production of <span class="italic">A History of Wales Derived from Authentic Sources</span> (1869), described by Daniel Lleufer Thomas in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as remaining &#145;even to this day the best history of Wales in the English language&#146;. It was not fully superseded until the publication of J. E. Lloyd's <span class="italic">A History of Wales</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Much of Jane Williams's work, and indeed her life, was essentially woman-centred. The most accessible and liveliest of her works is <span class="italic">An Autobiography of Elizabeth Davis, Betsy Cadwaladyr: a Balaclava Nurse</span> (1857). She interviewed the elderly Betsy Cadwaladr, a Bala woman who had led an adventurous life travelling the world as a domestic servant and a ship's steward and who had served as a nurse in the 1850s in the Crimean War hospitals of Scutari and Balaklava. Again, it was no mean task to turn Betsy's rambling reminiscences into a coherent narrative but Jane Williams persevered, motivated largely by the fact that Betsy severely criticized Florence Nightingale and the administration of the Crimean war hospitals; Williams produced this highly topical book while the scandal in Britain over Crimean maladministration still raged. In the long term, it has proved a valuable resource for students of Welsh women's history and was reprinted by Honno: Welsh Women's Press in 1987.<br>
<br>Jane Williams's <span class="italic">The Literary Women of England</span> (1861), which covers women writers from the ancient Britons to Mrs Hemans, is a further example of the centrality of women to her work. It is scholarly and still eminently readable and shows the store that she put on women's &#145;unwritten wisdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Literary Women of England</span>, 2), transmitted orally from generation to generation, as opposed to the more formal, academic &#145;knowledge possessed by men&#146;  (ibid.). Not surprisingly, her work is of interest to modern feminist scholars. While in her own time she was respected for her writings on Carnhuanawc and her history of Wales, late twentieth-century scholars are chiefly interested in her biography of Betsy Cadwaladyr and <span class="italic">The Literary Women of England</span>.<br>
<br>Jane Williams died unmarried on 15 March 1885 at her home, 31 Oakley Crescent, London. In her will she bequeathed a generous portion of her estate to her &#145;excellent personal attendant and faithful servant and attached friend, Mary Willey&#146;. She was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
