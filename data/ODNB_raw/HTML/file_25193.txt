<span class="headword">Shadwell, Sir  Lancelot</span>  (1779&#150;1850), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 3 May 1779, the eldest son of Lancelot Shadwell, a barrister and eminent conveyancer, and his wife, Elizabeth Whitmore, third daughter of Charles Whitmore of Southampton. He was educated at Eton College, and then at St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in the Michaelmas term of 1796. In 1800 he became seventh wrangler, obtained the second chancellor's medal, and graduated BA. He was elected a fellow of his college on 23 March 1801, took his MA degree in 1803, and received the honorary degree of LLD in 1842. He was admitted as a member of Lincoln's Inn on 30 June 1797, and was called to the bar on 10 February 1803.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1805 Shadwell married Harriet, daughter of Anthony Richardson, a London merchant; they had six sons including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25191/', "Sir Charles Frederick Alexander Shadwell (1814&#150;1886)")</script>, before Harriet's death on 25 May 1814. Shadwell married again on 4 January 1816. His second wife, Frances, was the youngest daughter of Captain Locke, and together they had six sons and five daughters, increasing the Shadwell family to seventeen. Frances survived Shadwell and died on 27 October 1854, aged sixty-six.<br>
<br>After practising for eighteen years, with much success, as a junior in the court of chancery, Shadwell was appointed a king's counsel on 8 December 1821, and took his seat within the bar on the first day of the Hilary term of 1822. As a QC, Shadwell refused to follow the practice of taking briefs in more than one equity court, preferring to give each case his undivided attention. At the general election in June 1826 he obtained a seat in the House of Commons for the borough of Ripon through the influence of Miss Elizabeth Sophia Lawrence, under whose will he subsequently received a handsome bequest. On 14 February 1827 he introduced a bill for the limitation of a writ of right and for the amendment of the law of dower, but it did not get beyond the committee stage. His parliamentary career was short, for on 31 October 1827 he was appointed vice-chancellor of England in the place of Sir Anthony Hart. On 16 November of the same year he was sworn a member of the privy council and knighted.<br>
<br>Shadwell presided in the vice-chancellor's court for nearly twenty-three years. During this period he twice filled the office of a commissioner of the great seal: from 23 April 1835 to 16 January 1836 in conjunction with Sir C. C. Pepys (afterwards Lord Cottenham) and Sir J. B. Bosanquet, and again from 19 June to 15 July 1850 in conjunction with Lord Langdale and Sir R. M. Rolfe (afterwards Lord Cranworth). On 24 June he was seized with a sudden illness, which prevented him from sitting again during the continuance of the second commission. He died at his residence, Barn Elms, Surrey, on 10 August 1850, aged seventy-one, and was buried in Barnes churchyard.<br>
<br>The last person to hold the title of vice-chancellor of England, Shadwell was a learned and able judge, with a reputation for being courteous and polite. He was elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn on 30 January 1822 and acted as treasurer in 1833. Outside the law, he had many interests. He was president of the Society of Psychrolutes, who bathed out of doors daily from November to March. He was in the habit of bathing every day, whatever the weather, in one of the creeks of the Thames near Barn Elms, and was said while thus engaged once to have granted an injunction. He was a tireless walker when young, and in 1797 he served as a member of the light horse volunteers. Shadwell also enjoyed skating. He was also something of a scholar, having translated both the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and the <span class="italic">Gospel According to St Matthew</span> from Greek into English (1844&#150;7 and 1859 respectively). He was thought of as a witty judge and was regarded as having been the best junior counsel of his time.<br>
<br>The vice-chancellor's eighth son, the second from his second marriage, <a name="cosubject_25194"></a><span class="headword">Lawrence Shadwell</span>  (1823&#150;1887), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Old Windsor, Berkshire, in July 1823. He was educated at Eton College and entered the army as ensign in the 98th foot on 26 April 1841. He served in the China expedition of 1842, the Punjab campaign of 1848&#150;9, and in the Crimean War of 1854&#150;6. He held the appointment of assistant quartermaster-general in the Crimea during the greater part of the war. On 2 August 1853 he married Helen Frances, daughter of Edward Coleridge, vicar of Mapledurham. After his return to England he was assistant quartermaster-general to the troops in the northern district from April 1857 to September 1861, in Nova Scotia from January to August 1862, and in the south-western district of England from April 1864 to February 1866. From 1866 to 1871 he was military assistant at the War Office. He was promoted to the rank of major-general on 6 March 1868, and was created a companion of the Bath on 2 June 1869. He was granted a reward for distinguished and meritorious services in January 1874, and was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 April 1879, and general on 1 July 1881. He retired from the army on 25 July 1881, and died at Reading on 16 August 1887; his wife survived him.<br>
