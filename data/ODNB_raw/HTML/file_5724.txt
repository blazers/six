<span class="headword">Clunie,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1757&#150;1819), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and songwriter</span>, was educated for the Church of Scotland and licensed by the presbytery of Edinburgh on 29 December 1784. He then became schoolmaster at Markinch, Fife, where possessing a fine voice and some musical skill he acted as precentor in the parish church. In 1790 he was presented by the duke of Buccleuch to the parish of Ewes, Dumfriesshire, and on 12 April 1791 to that of Borthwick, Edinburghshire; he was also chaplain of the eastern regiment of Edinburghshire volunteer infantry. On 31 October 1790, at Ewes, he married Mary, daughter of Alexander Oliphant, minister of Bower. He and Mary soon began a family.<br>
<br>Clunie's reputation for the rendering of Scottish songs led to an acquaintanceship with Burns, who highly appreciated his singing. Clunie also composed several songs of his own to the old tunes, but did not take the trouble to publish them. The first two stanzas of the song &#145;I lo'e na a laddie but ane&#146; are attributed to him by Burns, a better authority than Ritson, who in his <span class="italic">Collection of Scotch Songs</span> prefixes to them the initials J. D.; the four supplementary stanzas beginning with &#145;Let others brag weel o' their gair&#146; were added by Hector MacNeil. The song &#145;Ca' the yowes to the knowes&#146; was taken down by Stephen Clarke when he and Burns were spending a night with Clunie in 1787. Writing to George Thomson in September 1794, Burns says: &#145;I am flattered at your adopting &#145;Ca' the yowes to the knowes&#146;, as it was owing to me that it ever saw the light. About seven years ago, I was well acquainted with a worthy little fellow of a clergyman, a Mr. Clunzie, who, sang it charmingly; &amp; at my request, Mr. Clarke took it down from his singing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Letters</span>, 655). Burns added two stanzas to the song and made several alterations in the old verses; these old verses, as taken down by Clarke, are printed in Stenhouse's edition of Johnson's <span class="italic">The Scots Musical Museum</span>. Clunie was the author of the account of his parish in Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span>. He died at Greenend, near Edinburgh, on 13 April 1819, in his sixty-second year.<br>
