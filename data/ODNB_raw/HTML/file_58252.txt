<span class="headword">Gower, Sir  George Granville  Leveson-</span>  (1858&#150;1951), <span class="occ">autobiographer, politician, and private secretary</span>, was born in London on 19 May 1858, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34507/', "(Edward) Frederick Leveson-Gower (1819&#150;1907)")</script> and his wife, Lady Margaret Mary Frances Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Compton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16543/', "Granville George Leveson-Gower, second Earl Granville")</script>, the foreign secretary and colleague of W. E. Gladstone, was his uncle, and an important influence on his life. His mother died three days after his birth, and he was brought up by his father and uncle. He was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, matriculating in 1876. There he made many lifelong friends, including G. N. Curzon. He achieved a second class in moderations (1878) and in Greats (1880), the year of his uncle's return to office with Gladstone. He immediately became one of Gladstone's private secretaries and found himself on the inside of Liberal politics during an especially problematic government.<br>
<br>Mr Leveson, as Gladstone usually called Leveson-Gower, proved a much employed mediator between Gladstone and the many whigs with whom the prime minister was in disagreement. He worked for Gladstone throughout his second government, and in 1881 accompanied a mission to Spain. From 1885 to 1886 he was MP for North-West Staffordshire, a county in which the Granville interest was strong, and was a junior whip; he lost his post and his seat with the home rule defeat in 1886. He persisted in his attempt to pursue a political career, unsuccessfully contesting East Marylebone in 1889, and being elected at a by-election for Stoke-on-Trent in 1890 (a constituency his father had earlier represented). He held the seat in the election of 1892, but lost it in that of 1895. From 1892 to 1895 he was comptroller of the royal household and a church estates commissioner (often the only commissioner taking the Liberal line during the important discussion on Welsh disestablishment). He did not contest another seat. In the long Liberal opposition from 1895 until 1905 he was active in trying to retain whiggish support for the party, and to show his fellow Liberals that whigs could be useful. He served on the London school board 1897&#150;9, representing the City of London ward for the Progressive Party. On 9 June 1898 he married, at St Peter's, Eaton Square, London, (Adelaide Violet) Cicely Monson (<i>d</i>. 1955), daughter of Captain Debonnaire John Monson (1830&#150;1900), also of the royal household, and his wife, Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1936); they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Leveson-Gower had what he recalled as &#145;a very moderate income&#146;  (Leveson-Gower, <span class="italic">Years of Endeavour</span>, 196) and his political expenses came out of his own pocket, a fact which led him after his marriage to abandon his attempt at a political career. He wrote regularly for the periodicals and in 1899 became European editor of the <span class="italic">North American Review</span>. His <span class="italic">Poems</span> were published in 1902. He received no post in the Liberal government formed in 1905, though he became chairman of the Home Counties Liberal Federation. In 1908 he resigned from the <span class="italic">Review</span> to become commissioner of woods and forests, a post he held until 1924. He was later a director of two railway companies and of the Lillieshall Company. He was knighted in 1921.<br>
<br>Though his political career never matched its initial potential&#151;and, despite his loyalty, he came to be seen as something of a lightweight&#151;Leveson-Gower in old age became an amiable memorialist, publishing <span class="italic">Years of Content</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Years of Endeavour</span> (1942), and <span class="italic">Mixed Grill</span> (1947, enlarged edn 1948). These remain lively volumes, with many entertaining stories, mostly of a political and social sort. Leveson-Gower died on 18 July 1951.<br>
