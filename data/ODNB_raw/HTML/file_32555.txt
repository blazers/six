<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thomas Sidney</span>  (1803&#150;1902), <span class="occ">animal painter</span>, was born on 26 September 1803 in St Peter's Street, Canterbury, Kent, the second of two sons and three daughters. Of his parents nothing is known except that his father abandoned the family when Cooper was about five. Cooper had an early and continuing devotion to drawing, and one of his first memories was sketching the cathedral bell-tower. He could not afford pencils and paper for sketching, so he used his school slate until George Cattermole happened to see him drawing and gave him a large quantity of paper and a dozen pencils. Having no knife, Cooper asked passers-by to help sharpen his pencils and thus met Manners Sutton, archbishop of Canterbury, who promised 5<i>s</i>. for a copy of one of his drawings of Canterbury Cathedral, but actually paid &pound;5. By the age of twelve Cooper was apprenticed to paint coaches for the uncle of his schoolfriend William Burgess. When he was sixteen a Mr Doyle, a scene-painter for a travelling theatre, taught him scene painting and perspective. In 1823 Cooper's maternal uncle, a minister named Elvey, invited him to London, where he studied at the British Museum and in the Royal Academy Schools, which he entered in 1824. After nine months, Cooper was back in Canterbury, where he established himself as a drawing-master.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1827 Cooper and his friend Burgess sailed from Dover to Calais. They visited Gravelines, Dunkirk, Bruges, Ghent, and finally Brussels, painting signboards and portraits in exchange for their lodging. Cooper worked in pencil, watercolour, and lithography. The backgrounds of Cooper's portraits drew attention, and he began to concentrate on the study of landscape and animals. He became acquainted with the Flemish animal painter Eug&egrave;ne Verboeckhoven, who introduced him to the great seventeenth-century Dutch animal paintings of Paulus Potter and Aelbert Cuyp. Thereafter Cooper was sometimes referred to as an &#145;English Cuyp&#146; or a &#145;British Paulus Potter&#146;. Verboeckhoven was also responsible for encouraging Cooper to paint in oils.<br>
<br>While in Brussels, from 1827 to 1831, Cooper met Charlotte Pearson (1810&#150;1842), the daughter of one of the most respectable of its English residents. They married on 1 October 1829 and had four children: Maria Charlotte (1830&#150;1859), Lucy Elizabeth, later Mrs Coxon (1831&#150;1904), Georgina Mary (1833&#150;1868), and Thomas George (1836&#150;1901). The revolution of 1830 made life in Belgium difficult and Cooper, his pregnant wife, and first daughter returned to England in spring 1831, landing at Dover with &pound;13.<br>
<br>Drawing on his continental success, Cooper produced some topographical views of London, which were bought by Ackermann's in the Strand, as well as some of his lithographs. Having previously exhibited on the continent, in 1833 Cooper showed his first pictures in London, with the Society of Artists in Suffolk Street and at the Royal Academy, where his only entry was entitled <span class="italic">Landscape with Cattle</span>. Cooper faithfully portrayed various breeds of cattle, and the Victorian public loved his pictures of unspoiled countryside populated by placid cows and sheep. He became known as &#145;Cow&#146; Cooper to distinguish him from Abraham &#145;Horse&#146; Cooper. One of the great Victorian art patrons, Robert Vernon, commissioned <span class="italic">Farmyard with Cattle</span> from Cooper, which, together with another example of his work, is now in the Vernon collection at the Tate Britain, London.<br>
<br>Cooper was a prolific exhibitor and also showed at the New Watercolour Society and the British Institution. He exhibited many paintings at the Royal Academy, where he showed 266 pictures in an unprecedented and unbroken record from 1833 until 1902, when four landscapes with cattle appeared in the spring exhibition following his death. Cooper also showed paintings at international exhibitions, notably the Manchester Art Treasures of 1857, the Paris International of 1878, and the Manchester Jubilee of 1887. He enjoyed bountiful success and was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1845 and a Royal Academician in 1867. In 1861 a reviewer wrote that he was &#145;the painter of bucolics, and reigns supreme in the farm-yard, the sheep-fold, and the pasture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1861, 133).<br>
<br>In 1847 Frederick Richard Lee invited Cooper to visit him in Devon and the two decided to paint in collaboration, with Lee painting the landscape and Cooper adding the flocks and herds. From 1848 to 1856 their paintings appeared under both their names at the Royal Academy exhibitions. Cooper also worked in conjunction with other landscape painters, including Thomas Creswick and James Baker Pyne.<br>
<br>Cooper always maintained a home and a studio in London, and in 1848 purchased land at Harbledown, near Canterbury, where he built a house he named Vernon Holme, in honour of his early patron. After the death of his first wife in 1842 Cooper remained a widower until 1863, when he married Mary, daughter of William Cannon, a miller, of Canterbury. They had one son, Nevill Louis (1864&#150;1936). Soon after the death of Cooper's mother in 1865, he bought the house where he was born and some adjacent properties, which he developed into a picture gallery and school of art. In 1882 Cooper presented to the city of Canterbury the Sidney Cooper Gallery of Art, now known as the Royal Museum and Art Gallery. This museum holds the most important collection of his paintings, drawings, and lithographs, as well as his personal memorabilia.<br>
<br>In addition to the museum in Canterbury and Tate Britain in London, there are paintings by Cooper in many provincial English museums. The Royal Collection includes two paintings by Cooper: <span class="italic">The Entrance to Carisbrooke Castle</span> (1837), which he presented to Queen Victoria for her jubilee in 1887, and <span class="italic">The Victoria Cow</span>, a royal commission of 1848 when he was asked to paint the royal stock at Osborne. In 1901 Cooper was appointed CVO by Edward VII.<br>
<br>Although he was still painting in his ninety-ninth year, there was a gradual decline of Cooper's strength in his last few months and he died at his home, Vernon Holme, on 7 February 1902, survived by his second daughter, Lucy, his second wife, Mary, and his son Nevill. His funeral was held on 13 February at Canterbury Cathedral, and he was buried in the churchyard of St Martin's, Canterbury. The contents of Cooper's studio were sold by Christie, Manson, and Wood from 12 to 15 April 1902.<br>
