<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chapman,  Frederick Spencer</span>  (1907&#150;1971), <span class="occ">explorer and mountaineer</span>, was born on 10 May 1907 at Kensington, London, the younger son and younger child of Frank Spencer Chapman, solicitor, of Oakwood Court, Kensington, and his wife, Winifred Ormond, who died within a month of the birth. She was the daughter of William Ormond, solicitor. Frank Spencer Chapman's business failed and he left for Canada to become a farmer when his younger son was two; he left his boys in the care of Ernest Dewick, an elderly clergyman, and his wife, Sophie. The boys lived with them near Carlisle and later at Lindale, where Frederick began to develop a lifelong interest in the creatures and plants of wild countryside. A young ordinand in the house took him up Helvellyn at the age of eight. When the Dewicks retired, the Chapman boys went to live with Sam Taylor, vicar of Flookburgh in Cartmel, and his wife, Ella, both of whom were a stalwart support during Frederick's subsequent turbulent career. Their father wrote to them regularly but in 1914 enlisted in the Canadian mounted rifles and was killed during the battle of the Somme in September 1916.<br>
<br>In 1921 Chapman went to Sedbergh School, where he began to display his endurance and passion for exploration. He won a Kitchener scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, and obtained third classes in both English part one (1928) and history part two (1929). At Cambridge he met Geoffrey Winthrop Young, the alpine mountaineer who held open house for young climbers and others. Chapman learned rock climbing on the walls and roofs of colleges, and was taken to the Alps by Lawrence Wager and Jack Longland. He became acquainted with young explorers, pre-eminently H. G. (Gino) Watkins, who invited him to join him on an expedition to Greenland.<br>
<br>The British Arctic air route expedition (1930&#150;31), which surveyed air routes with two Tiger Moths, gave Chapman an opportunity to display his toughness, particularly in the cleverly navigated rescue of Augustine Courtauld from the completely snowed-up meteorological station on the 10,000 foot Greenland ice-cap. Of all his expeditions, it was the one to which he contributed most. Chapman's <span class="italic">Northern Lights</span> (1932) vividly recalls the enchantment and rigours of exploring, sledging, and keeping alive in the Arctic. In 1932&#150;3 Watkins led another party to continue the Arctic air survey, but was drowned when seal-hunting in a kayak in the first few weeks. On his return Chapman, who had been one of the party, wrote <span class="italic">Watkins' Last Expedition</span> (1934), which is full of fascinating vignettes of Inuit life and the party's success in living, like them, off the creatures of sea and land.<br>
<br>Chapman then turned to teaching, and accepted a post at Aysgarth preparatory school. He found the change from his Greenland adventures difficult, although his reputation as an explorer was an asset in dealing with small boys, whom he took into the wilder country near the school and inspired with some of his own passion for natural history. Meanwhile, and for most of the rest of his life, he was in demand as an admirable lecturer on his Arctic and other adventures. Remarkable as these were, they lost nothing in the telling. But the mountains still called, and after two years he left Aysgarth in 1935 to join Marco Pallis's Himalayan expedition. This was perhaps not exactly right for him: he did not share Pallis's passion for Tibetan culture, and had hoped to be chosen for an Everest expedition, for which his mountaineering experience was too slight. He was, however, invited to join a government mission to Lhasa, capital of Tibet, which he thought a more exciting prospect than running a prep school. But this too proved not quite what he wanted. He found the Tibetans less approachable than his beloved Inuit. In 1937, however, when his time at Lhasa came to an end, he mounted an expedition with one English companion and only three Sherpas to Chomolhari, a striking and challenging 24,000 foot mountain on the southern borders of Tibet. His account of its ascent, with only one novice Sherpa porter, was doubted by some experienced mountaineers, but a later analysis in the <span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span> gave him the credit for having succeeded against the odds and in wretched weather. Two books record this stage of his career: <span class="italic">Lhasa: the Holy City</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Helvellyn to Himalaya</span> (1940), both reasonably successful but not reaching the standard of his earlier Greenland books.<br>
<br>After Chomolhari, still uncertain whether a life of expeditions or of schoolmastering was to give him what he wanted, Chapman was introduced to Kurt Hahn, headmaster of Gordonstoun School, who in 1938 appointed him a housemaster. Gordonstoun and Hahn's educational beliefs suited Chapman well, and helped to shape ideas which he implemented later in Germany and South Africa. But he had completed only four terms there when war came, and as a territorial officer with the Seaforth Highlanders he joined up at once. He was soon given appropriate work, helping to train a mountain division and the first of the commandos in Scotland. He was then transferred to Australia. Chapman was posted to Singapore in September 1941, and when the first Japanese landings in Malaya came two months later he was sent to Kuala Lumpur &#145;expressly to organize and lead reconnaissance and operational parties behind the enemy lines&#146;. He did this for nearly three years. He himself felt that he had missed the &#145;real war&#146;, and yet his record of endurance and resourcefulness and his ability to escape from the Japanese, who had put a price on his head, are almost unmatched in the history of the Second World War. When taken out by submarine in 1945 he returned to Colombo a justified hero. His story came later in the best of all his books, <span class="italic">The Jungle is Neutral</span> (1948), which was an enormous success. Chapman had also earned a DSO (1944) and bar (1946).<br>
<br>In 1946 Chapman married Faith Mary, the daughter of Major George Harrison Townson; they had three sons. He spent a year as first organizing secretary of the Outward Bound Trust. In 1948 he was appointed to build up a new boarding-school, for the British forces education service, the King Alfred School at Pl&ouml;n in West Germany. He had a free hand to appoint staff and develop the school as he wished. He made a success of the post, but resigned in 1952 to caravan across Africa with his wife and three small boys. The book which resulted, <span class="italic">Lightest Africa</span> (1955), was not a success.<br>
<br>From 1956 to 1962 Chapman was headmaster of the Anglican foundation of St Andrew's College, Grahamstown, South Africa. He was not really happy there, and resigned when South Africa became a republic in 1961. From 1962 to 1966 he was warden of the Pestalozzi children's village at Sedlescombe, but this was another job that did not suit him. He was rescued by an old friend of Special Operations Executive days, Professor Vernon Mallinson, of Reading University, who in 1966 offered him the wardenship of Wantage Hall, one of the university halls of residence. There he was contented and made a useful mark. Yet he became worried about his impending retirement and his health. He began to doubt what his life, with all its adventures and heroism and sheer indestructibility, amounted to. Despite his remarkable record, all his life he aspired towards greater fame than he felt he had actually achieved. He shot himself in his office in Reading on 8 August 1971. Among his awards were the Arctic medal (1931), the Gill memorial medal of the Royal Geographical Society (1941), the Mungo Park medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (1948), the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> special award and gold medal (1949), and the Lawrence of Arabia memorial medal of the Royal Central Asian Society (1950).<br>
