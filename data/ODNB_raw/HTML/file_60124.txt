<span class="headword">Louth,  William  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1240&#150;1298), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Ely</span>, was presumably born at Louth in Lincolnshire, probably <i>c</i>.1240, judging by the chronology of his career. His parentage is unknown, but besides his early benefices in the diocese, which are not significant in themselves, there are some slight indications of a connection with the county. His appellation of master in the chancery rolls implies that he completed a course of study at a university before he entered the royal service, as one of an increasing number of graduates there.<br>
<br>Louth probably became a royal clerk in the last years of Henry III's reign. He went to Rome in the spring of 1272, and, although there is no record of his journey, his companion Hugh Warwick, who appointed an attorney, seems to have been subordinate to him. As Louth's earliest known preferment came in 1277, it is likely that he was sent on a mission rather than travelling to seek his own fortune. He was described as clerk of the royal household in 1275, but was cofferer of the wardrobe during the keepership of Thomas (I) Bek from 1274 to 1280. Bek, a doctor of civil law and chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1270, was the son of the lord of Eresby in Lincolnshire. Louth, who had some private transactions in the county during the same decade, may have owed something to local patronage.<br>
<br>The wardrobe was in origin the storehouse and safe deposit of the royal household in the same sense as the chamber was the king's bedroom. It became the household's accounting office, just as the exchequer became the accounting office of the treasury. Louth joined it at a significant time, when the wardrobe was emerging as a compact and efficient office, staffed by men of wide and varied experience who were closely in touch with the king. Under Edward I it was made to function both as a second chancery and a second treasury, and had to deal with an endless variety of administrative demands. In the course of any year Louth had to collect and dispense cash, negotiate and record credits of all kinds, and discharge commissions at home and abroad of widely varying delicacy. In the spring of 1283 he held a commission to raise loans for the Welsh expedition from foreign merchants, at his own discretion, and was equipped with sealed letters of credit for the lenders. All those matters were more or less urgent, and maintaining royal credit was not made easier by repeated application. None of the additional duties facilitated the day-to-day routines of the office, and many were deleterious to them. Diplomatic and other extraneous business, such as the negotiation of loans, or exercise of patronage upon some particular instruction, complicated the accounts as well as consuming time, in a period when the wardrobe's annual turnover was &pound;44,000 as against &pound;24,000 under Bek, and the exchequer was providing rather less than half the wardrobe's income.<br>
<br>The most significant episode in Louth's career was probably the work that fell to him in 1278&#150;80 when Edward built a castle and a new town at Rhuddlan in the county of Flint, which served as a major base in the second Welsh war in 1282&#150;3. The project involved extensive surveying and civil engineering, the co-ordination of labour and supplies on a large scale, and eventually the settlement of the town. Louth was involved at every level with its organization and finance. He was rewarded with prebends at Beverley and Lincoln in 1279, and succeeded Bek as keeper of the wardrobe on 20 November 1280. In the spring of that year he was appointed with the chief justice of Chester to oversee the settlement of the remaining plots at Rhuddlan.<br>
<br>In the 1280s Louth spent some time abroad, chiefly in Gascony, both with and without the king. Early in 1283 he became dean of the collegiate church of St Martin's-le-Grand, London, a preferment more imposing in style than in substance, which was reinforced within a year by the archdeaconry of Durham. On that occasion he received a papal licence to hold his benefices for up to five years without taking holy orders. He then spent the autumn abroad, and in 1286 went to Gascony with the king, after which he had letters of protection and attorney, renewed on various occasions until the autumn of 1289.<br>
<br>Louth was elected bishop of Ely on 12 May 1290 and was finally constrained to take orders. He was consecrated and enthroned on 1 October following. Walter Langton, later treasurer, succeeded him at the wardrobe, but Louth continued to render accounts for several years. In 1291 he was appointed to a commission to determine the dispute in the Welsh march which led to the imprisonment of the earls of Gloucester and Hereford, Gilbert de Clare and Humphrey (VI) de Bohun. In the remaining years of his life he probably gave as much attention to public affairs in London and abroad as to those of his diocese. The chapel of St Etheldreda, Ely Place, the last remnant of Ely House, is probably his work.<br>
<br>Louth died on either 25 or 27 March 1298, and was buried in the south choir aisle at Ely. Only the canopy of his tomb survives, but its design and sculpture has a close affinity with the monument to Edmund (Crouchback), first earl of Lancaster, in Westminster Abbey. It is almost certainly a product of the royal workshops: a last recognition by the king of Louth's faithful service. The executors of Louth's will included Richard of Gravesend (<i>d</i>. 1303), bishop of London, and Walter Langton. All that is known of his next of kin is that his heir was a nephew, William Tuchet.<br>
