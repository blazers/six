<span class="headword">Porter,  Mary</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1765), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was probably the daughter of Samuel Porter and his wife, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37757/', "Nicolaus Kaufmann Mercator")</script>. The little information we have about Mary's early life comes from a friend, &#145;P. M.&#146;, and is included in Thomas Betterton's <span class="italic">History of the English Stage</span> (1741). Having been initially in the care of her uncle David Mercator, a clerk at the Tower of London, she was put by her mother:<blockquote>into Bartholomew Fair; where, the very first time of her Appearance, in Acting the Part of the Fairy Queen, Mrs Barry and Mrs Bracegirdle took so great a liking to her, that, upon their Representation of her Performance, Mr Betterton admitted her into the Theatre &hellip; Our young Fairy Queen was boarded with Mrs Smith, Sister to the Treasurer of the Playhouse. (Betterton, 60)</blockquote>In Thomas Davies's version it is Betterton himself who &#145;saw her act, when a child, the Genius of Britain, in a Lord Mayor's Pageant&#146;  (Davies, 3.276). Her first recorded appearance on the Lincoln's Inn Fields stage was to speak the epilogue to Mary Pix's <span class="italic">Queen Catherine</span> in June 1698. The following season she took the parts of Orythia in Charles Hopkins's <span class="italic">Friendship Improved</span> and Philadelphia in Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span>. The patchy records for the period indicate that for the season 1703&#150;4 Porter spoke prologues and epilogues, acted in both comedy and tragedy, and received a salary of &pound;35&#150;40 as a middle-ranking player. When John Vanbrugh's new Queen's Theatre opened in 1705 she transferred and played two seasons there, concentrating on such comic roles as Araminta in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Confederacy</span>, Lady Graveairs in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span>, Doralice in John Dryden's <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span>, Eugenia in Edward Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The London Cuckolds</span>, and Fainlove in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Tender Husband</span>. Under Owen Swiny's management at the Queen's in late 1706 she was earning 40<i>s</i>. per week.<br>
<br>In 1707 Porter was not engaged by the Queen's company and she complained to the lord chamberlain that, although she had been on the stage almost 12 years, &#145;she was postponed in her Benefit Play &hellip; till the 2<sup>d</sup> of May last when the Town was almost empty&#146; and that &#145;a Gentlewoman was taken in over her head, which will still be a means to take away those Parts from her by which she hop'd to advance herself&#146;  (TNA: PRO, LC 7/3, fols. 102&#150;3). Matters changed in January 1708, when a united troupe was drawn up to act at Drury Lane. Porter was one of several dissenting players who petitioned the lord chamberlain for permission to act with the new company  (Milhous and Hume, <span class="italic">Vice Chamberlain Coke's Theatrical Papers</span>, 51). During the next two seasons at Drury Lane, Porter added many new roles to her repertory, including Zaida in Charles Goring's <span class="italic">Irene</span>, Emilia in George Etherege's <span class="italic">The Man of Mode</span>, Roxana in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span>, and Dorothea in William Mountfort's <span class="italic">The Successful Strangers</span>. However, in 1709 Porter was tempted back to Swiny at the Queen's Theatre by a salary of &pound;80 per season, with no obligation for summer performances, plus a solo benefit less &pound;40 house charges. She studied only a few new parts that season, among them Lady Macduff, Leonora in John Crowne's <span class="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</span>, and the Queen in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>.<br>
<br>The theatrical landscape changed once more in 1710, when Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks took over the management of Drury Lane and won over leading performers such as Porter. Porter remained at Drury Lane for more than twenty years, taking on many of the roles of Elizabeth Barry and earning herself a reputation as the &#145;capital Actress in tragedy&#146;  (Victor, 2.57). Roles in which critics found her particularly noteworthy were Hermione in Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span>, Alicia in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, and Lady Macbeth, where Chetwood thought &#145;her just Action, Eloquence of Look and Gesture, mov'd Astonishment&#146;  (Chetwood, 29). As Octavia in Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span> she &#145;drew not only respect, but the more affecting approbation of tears from the audience&#146;  (Davies, 2.241). As Katherine in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, Davies thought her &#145;dignity and grace&#146; unmatched:<blockquote>Her first speech to the King after kneeling to him, was uttered with such intelligence and sensibility, that she commanded the applause, as well as the attention of the audience. The words were simple, and, seemingly, unimportant; but she understood her author well, and in delivering them, conveyed the prime duties of kingly office with energy. (Davies, 1.206)</blockquote>Porter was popular in both comedy and tragedy. By the 1720s she was receiving the very considerable salary of &pound;266 1<i>s</i>. per season and a benefit clear of house charges. The leading roles she had hoped for in her younger days were now hers, including Selima in Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, Belvidera in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> and Monimia in his <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, Lucia in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Cato</span>, Artemisa in Rowe's <span class="italic">The Ambitious Step-Mother</span>, the title roles in Charles Johnson's <span class="italic">Medea</span> and in Richard West's <span class="italic">Hecuba</span>, and Queen Elizabeth in John Banks's <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span>. By the 1720s she was adding only a couple of new roles each season to her formidable repertory.<br>
<br>There are no reliable likenesses of Porter, but Davies described her as &#145;tall and well-shaped; of a fair complexion, but not handsome; her voice was harsh and unpleasing&#146;  (Davies, 3.279), and Victor agreed that she had &#145;a plain Person and a bad Voice&#146;  (Victor, 2.57). However, Porter had overcome these difficulties and had strengthened her voice &#145;by Labour and Practice into sufficient Force to fill the Theatre&#146;  (ibid.). She had several tricks for producing affecting performances. Hill reported that &#145;the chief secret of Mrs Porter in tragical attitudes&#146; was to extend her arms and to move with &#145;freedom and openness of action&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.203&#150;4). Chetwood recalled that he &#145;heard her declare she left the Action to the Possession of the Sentiments in the Part she perform'd&#146;  (Chetwood, 29). Several commentators note that &#145;she enters most into her character&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>), tackling tragic parts with particular enthusiasm and producing &#145;a spirited Propriety in all Characters of Rage; but when Grief and Tenderness possessed her, she subsided into the most affecting softness&#146;  (Victor, 2.58).<br>
<br>Porter's income allowed her to maintain a home in Highwood Hill, Hendon, and, from 1722 to 1733, a house in James Street, Covent Garden. Davies paints a romantic picture of her driving back to Hendon in a chaise with only a book and a brace of pistols. In 1731 she had a serious accident in the chaise, having seen off a would-be highwayman, and dislocated her thigh. For some time she was incapacitated or required the aid of a cane. She returned to Drury Lane in 1733 and played a couple of her most popular roles, as she did during the following two seasons. Thereafter she gave occasional performances at both houses, earning the large sum of &pound;20 per performance, and was still able to draw an audience. Davies thought she integrated her cane into her performance in <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span> with aplomb, and he considered her Clytemnestra in James Thomson's <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> of 1738 remarkable, despite her limited range of motion.<br>
<br>Porter's last appearance was her own benefit night and a command performance of <span class="italic">The Albion Queens</span> at Covent Garden on 14 February 1743. After this time her financial situation worsened, as an annuity she had relied upon came to an end. She made some money through the patronage of Henry Hyde, Viscount Cornbury, who allowed her to print a subscription edition of his comedy <span class="italic">The Mistakes</span>. In her old age she lived with Frances, the widow of Colonel Cotterell, a friend of Dr Johnson. Porter died on 24 February 1765 and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 27 February. She does not appear to have married. In her will she left &pound;10 to her cousin Nicholas Mercator and her lands, house, money, plate, furniture, and the rest of her estate to Frances Cotterell, for her care and friendship.<br>
