<span class="headword">Daniels,  Maxine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Gladys Daniels; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Gladys Lynch]</span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at 3 Raine Street, Stepney, London, on 2 November 1930, the ninth of thirteen children of Oscar Lynch (1882/3&#150;1970), a seaman who served in the merchant navy during the First World War and who was known after 1932 as Oliver Lindsay Lynch, and his wife, Amelia Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Spring (1895&#150;1979). At the time of her birth her parents lived at 35 Cornwall Street, Stepney. Her father was Barbadian, her mother was English, from a family of mixed-race Londoners whose presence in Britain predated the mid-19th century. Her youngest surviving sibling was the singer and entertainer Kenneth (Kenny) Lynch (<i>b</i>. 1939). She grew up in Shadwell in Stepney's dockland, a colourful area of London's East End immortalized by writers drawn to its drama and distress. Here, seamen from across the world were among those who put down roots and developed a community in the shadow of St George-in-the-East, united by mutual need in times of unemployment that disproportionately affected people of colour. Her parents, who had married in 1915, sustained a long-lived relationship in the face of extreme poverty.<br>
<br>Gladys Lynch started work as a pickle-bottler and peanut-roaster, then graduated to sawing wood in a glass works before getting her first job as a singer in a semi-professional band led by a grocer. She was working as a packer when on 8 July 1950 she married Charles Edward (Charlie) Daniels (1922&#150;1988), a merchant seaman born in nearby Custom House. Their marriage represented a further welding of diasporan connections for his father, Nathaniel Daniels, was Caribbean, a seaman from Union Island in the Grenadines (the family name was correctly spelt Daniel) and his London-born mother, Margaret (Maggie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pye, who, like her own maternal grandmother, was of partial Irish descent.<br>
<br>As Gladys Daniels she sang with Reg Cavell's band in Romford and performed with other local dance bands while continuing to do daytime work. Her ease with jazz and the popular songs of the day ensured that she became known to London's West End musicians but her professional break came shortly after the birth of her daughter, Hazel Annette (<i>b</i>. 1953), when she won second place in a competition organized by the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>. The chance to sing with a &#145;name&#146; band ensued and she joined Denny Boyce, with whom she remained for nearly three years (1954&#150;6). It was he who suggested she change her name and she adopted this from the African-American singer Maxine Sullivan, one of her favourites. Through Boyce's regular Radio Luxembourg broadcasts she attracted a wider audience and the opportunity to record for the Oriole label. She continued to appear with Boyce on radio and television but increasingly performed as a solo artist in variety until 1956 when she did her first cabaret date at the Astor in London's Mayfair.<br>
<br>As a recording artist Daniels had several successes, but as the emphasis in popular music changed from melodic ballads and harmonic inventiveness to material reliant mainly on rhythmic content and drive, she joined a rock and roll package show headed by the drummer Tony Crombie and his Rockets. However, for someone who had grown up admiring such singers as Maxine Sullivan, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald, the music was alien and she repeatedly made it clear that she preferred to sing ballads and jazz. She continued to perform within her chosen field, both on the continent and at American bases, and was always welcome as a cabaret artist in London's West End. She had a regular spot on BBC television's <span class="italic">Tonight</span> programme, and in the late 1950s began an association with the trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton's band. She continued to record and did some acting, but her attempts to combine show business with motherhood led to illness and the need for her to take an enforced rest. She withdrew from show business in 1958 and in 1963 moved to Southend, where she continued to sing occasionally in the surrounding area. She returned to touring and recording in 1966 but further health complications forced her to take a second break from the music business.<br>
<br>Following heart surgery Daniels began working again with Lyttelton in 1988 and it was the trumpeter who was responsible for helping revive her career. She became a well-known figure in jazz circles, appearing at festivals and working in the Netherlands with the traditionalist Dutch Swing College Band. She sang with such notable Americans as the singer Billy Eckstine and instrumentalists Al Cohn and Wild Bill Davison, and recorded for Lyttelton's Calligraph label. In the 1990s she toured with her fellow singers Rosemary Squires and Barbara Jay in a musical <span class="italic">Tribute to Ella Fitzgerald</span>, which they recorded for Spotlite (1994), accompanied by the saxophonist Tommy Whittle. Daniels made her first solo CD for Calligraph in 1995, and in 1996 toured with Jay and Tina May in the production <span class="italic">Ladies of Jazz</span>.<br>
<br>Daniels occupied the land between jazz and popular song. She phrased superbly and swung, enunciating her words with great clarity, but it was the warmth in her voice that made her so convincing a singer. Her models were African-American but a distinct accent without any transatlantic allegiance underlined the qualities of a London original. Although not one to suffer fools gladly, she was a soft, gentle person. Tony Williams, who recorded her for his Spotlite label, described her as &#145;a very modest lady&#146;  (private information) and it was undoubtedly because of this lack of flamboyance that the British jazz community, while admiring her voice, seldom gave her more than the routine respect accorded a local artist. Despite the psychological problems that frequently kept her out of the spotlight, she was, as her daughter said, &#145;a completely free spirit&#146;, enabled to follow her chosen path through her husband's support. She retained a faithful following among the general public but, as her daughter noted, &#145;She wasn't really aware of her talent. Because it came so easily, she didn't realise how good she was&#146;  (private information). She died on 20 October 2003 in Oldchurch Hospital, Romford, from bronchopneumonia, and was survived by her daughter.<br>
