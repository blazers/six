<span class="headword">Julian,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1913), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and hymnologist</span>, was born in Mithian, near St Agnes, Cornwall, on 27 January 1839, the eldest son of Thomas Julian, miner (later civil engineer), and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ensor. He was educated privately and entered St Aidan's College, Durham, in 1864 to study for the Anglican ministry. Two years later he was ordained deacon by Archbishop William Thomson in York Minster, to serve his title as curate of Thornaby-on-Tees in the North Riding of Yorkshire. On 5 September 1866, at Eccleshall, he married Mary Bibby (1829/30&#150;1890), youngest daughter of Samuel Cocker, steel manufacturer. They had two daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Ethel May, and a son, who predeceased him.<br>
<br>In 1867 Julian was ordained priest, and moved from Thornaby to St Mark's, Liverpool, in 1868. In 1871 he began his third curacy, at St Peter's, Preston, Lancashire. In 1874 he wrote the hymn &#145;Father of all to thee&#146;, published in Godfrey Thring's <span class="italic">Church of England Hymn Book</span> in 1882. It was the only one of Julian's hymns to be selected for inclusion in the second edition of <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span>.<br>
<br>In 1876 Julian became the incumbent of Wincobank, in the South Riding of Yorkshire, where he conducted most of his research for the main work of scholarship for which he is renowned: <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Hymnology, setting forth the origin and history of the Christian hymns of all ages and nations, with special reference to those contained in the hymn-books of English-speaking countries, and now in common use, together with biographical and critical notices of their authors and translators, and historical articles on national and denominational hymnody, breviaries, missals, primers, psalters, sequences, &amp;c., &amp;c</span>. The first edition, published by John Murray in 1892, was in one volume of 150 pages. A second, enlarged and revised edition with a supplement was published in 1907, and is widely recognized as one of the most significant contributions to the study of hymnology.<br>
<br>Having being made an honorary MA of Durham University in 1887, Julian was created a Lambeth DD in 1894 by the archbishop of Canterbury, Edward W. Benson, in recognition of his dictionary's significant editorial scholarship. In the same year he was made an honorary LLD of Howard University, Washington DC, and wrote <span class="italic">History of the Use of Hymns in Public Worship, and their Proper Characteristics</span>. After the death of his first wife, he married on 3 February 1894 Eva Christine Katherine Pilipp, the eldest daughter of Johann Pilipp of Schweinan, Nuremburg.<br>
<br>In 1901 Julian was made prebendary of Fenton, and honorary canon with a stall in York Minster. He left Wincobank in 1905 (with gifts of a candelabrum and a gold watch and chain) on his appointment by the dean and chapter of York as vicar of St Columba's, Topcliffe, near Thirsk in the North Riding of Yorkshire. As a senior cleric in the diocese he was also made a bishop's surrogate in 1903 and became rural dean of Thirsk in 1906. During his incumbency of Topcliffe he bought land and made minor additions and re-orderings to the church, such as moving the font slightly eastward, creating a choir vestry at the foot of the tower, and moving the pulpit to the north side of the nave. He continued to publish in the area of hymnology: <span class="italic">Sacred Carols, Ancient and Modern, with Musical Illustrations</span> appeared in 1909, followed in 1911 by <span class="italic">A Critical Monograph on Nearer my God to Thee</span>. After suffering from a brief illness, during which he underwent an operation, he died in his vicarage in Front Street, Topcliffe, on 22 January 1913. A memorial service took place at Topcliffe on 24 January and he was buried the following day. In a closely typed will, he bequeathed such items as &#145;the Madonna in my dining room&#146;, a &#145;presentation tea urn&#146;, a silver lamp, various musical instruments, the candelabra, and various pictures including etchings by Rubens and family oil portraits.<br>
<br>Since its publication, Julian's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Hymnology</span> has been the definitive work in the study of hymns and their authors, and it survives as Julian's most significant contribution to ecclesiastical, poetical, and historical literature. Involving the work of forty-three contributors as well as Julian himself, it is particularly important for its research into early Latin, Greek, and German hymns, for which Julian had a particular penchant. He also had a high opinion of his <i>magnum opus</i>: in his will he described it as a work on which he had &#145;spent much time and arduous labour&#146; (it seems that he began work on it in 1881). In its preface he claimed that in order to attain &#145;minute technical accuracy&#146;, everything was meticulously researched at first hand, such that &#145;The pursuit of this aim has very frequently demanded, for the production of one page only, as much time and attention, as is usually expended on one hundred pages of ordinary history or criticism.&#146; Ten thousand manuscripts were consulted, and over a thousand people wrote letters to Julian assisting him in his research into a field that, according to Julian, numbered more than 400,000 hymns. This being so, Julian's research and achievement was truly magisterial; his dictionary has remained at the forefront of hymnological research for over a hundred years.<br>
<br>Three of the hymns that Julian himself wrote remain in use: &#145;Father of all, to thee&#146;, &#145;Hark, the voice eternal&#146;, and &#145;O God of God&#146;. Before he died he gave his extensive library of books and manuscripts on hymnology to the library of Church House, Westminster.<br>
