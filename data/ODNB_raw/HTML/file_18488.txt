<span class="headword">Mearns,  Duncan</span>  (1779&#150;1852), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born on 28 August 1779, the elder of two children, at the manse of Towie, Aberdeenshire, where his father, Alexander Mearns (1745&#150;1820), was parish minister. His mother was Anne (<i>d</i>. 1823), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19267/', "James Morison")</script> of Disblair and Elsick, lord provost of Aberdeen; she was the widow of John Farquhar (1732&#150;1768), minister of Nigg in Kincardineshire, with whom she had had three sons. At the age of twelve Mearns entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, gaining the first bursary. He graduated MA in 1795 and went on to study divinity under Gilbert Gerard and George Campbell. He was licensed by the presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil in June 1799, and in November of that year he was ordained assistant in the parish of Tarves, Aberdeenshire, to which he succeeded soon after. On 11 August 1808 he married Elizabeth Forsyth (<i>d</i>. 1830), with whom he had eight daughters and two sons, the younger of whom, William (1814&#150;1891), became minister of Kinneff. His eldest daughter, Anne, married Robert Macpherson, Mearns's successor in the divinity chair, while his second daughter, Jane, married Hercules Scott, professor of moral philosophy in Aberdeen University.<br>
<br>Mearns was admitted to the chair of divinity in December 1816; while not in principle opposed to the practice, he declined to follow his predecessor's example in holding the chair in plurality. In 1818 he was awarded a DD by St Andrews University. A leading figure in the moderate party in the Church of Scotland, he served as moderator of the general assembly in 1821, becoming a royal chaplain in 1823. He took a prominent part in the events leading up to the Disruption of 1843, showing a particular interest in the suspended moderate ministers in the presbytery of Strathbogie. Mearns was always deeply studious and retiring; in the words of his obituary in the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span> he was &#145;plain to a degree of earnestness in his own tastes and habits, he let the vain show of the world pass with contempt&#146;. For a scholar of such repute he published little: his <span class="italic">Principles of Christian Evidence Illustrated</span> (1818) was, perhaps significantly, as much a polemical as a theological work, with Thomas Chalmers as its intended target. After his death, his Murtle lectures appeared in two volumes as <span class="italic">Lectures on Scripture Characters</span> (1853), edited by his son William. He died, after a long and painful illness, at Chanonry, Old Aberdeen, on 2 March 1852, and was buried in the churchyard of St Machar's, Aberdeen, on 5 March.<br>
