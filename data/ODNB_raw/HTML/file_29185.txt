<span class="headword">Wheeler,  Daniel</span>  (1771&#150;1840), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, son of William Wheeler (<i>d</i>. 1778?), of Conduit Street, Hanover Square, London, and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1784?), his wife, was born at home on 27 November 1771. His parents were active members of the Church of England. His father, a wine merchant, died when Daniel was about six; his mother died six years later, by which time he was at a boarding-school in London at Parson's Green, Fulham. A clerical relative managed the estate and the business, until his brother could take it over. A situation was obtained for Wheeler on board a merchant ship trading to Porto, but after two or three voyages he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman, being then under fourteen. He was soon promoted to a flagship, but abandoned the sea after six years, and, having squandered all his pay, enlisted as a private soldier in a regiment ordered to Ireland. In a year or two he was drafted into one of the new regiments raised to fight the French, and he sailed for Flanders to join the British army under command of the duke of York. Later, having obtained a commission in a regiment destined for the West Indies, he sailed under Sir Ralph Abercromby, about September 1795.<br>
<br>In 1796 Wheeler left the army and settled at Handsworth Woodhouse, near Sheffield, with his elder sister, Barbara, who had married William Hoyland, a Quaker. In 1797 he was received as a member of the society, and set up as a seed merchant in Sheffield. His life was now lived within the Society of Friends. On 13 June 1800 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1833), daughter of Thomas and Rachel Brady of Thorne, Yorkshire, a well-established Quaker family. They had four sons: William (<i>d</i>. 24 Nov 1836), Joshua (<i>d</i>. 29 March 1841), Daniel (<i>d</i>. 1848), and Charles (<i>d</i>. 6 Feb 1840). His elder daughter, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1807), who afterwards married William Tanner of Bristol, survived him. Of his younger daughter, Jane (<i>d</i>. 15 July 1837, at Shoosharry), a short account was published in London and Bristol in 1841.<br>
<br>About 1809 Wheeler and his family moved to a farm in the country, where he began to prepare himself for a life of ministry. He was recognized as a minister in 1816. He had had for several years a sense that he should again go abroad, and after the emperor Alexander I of Russia had in 1814 visited a Friend's farm during a visit to England, and had sought a manager of that persuasion for his establishment at Okhta, Wheeler in 1817 proceeded to St Petersburg. He saw the tsar, and explained to him the leaning he had for two years felt towards Russia as a sphere of missionary labour. He then returned to England, wound up his affairs, and with his wife, family, and servants&#151;in all twenty persons&#151;along with implements, seeds, and cattle, he left Hull for St Petersburg on 22 June 1818.<br>
<br>Besides the tsar's farm, Wheeler was soon appointed to the management of an estate belonging to the dowager empress, consisting, like the other, chiefly of swamp. This, after being thoroughly drained, was divided into farms of 30&#150;100 acres each, which were let to peasants at moderate rents; a portion of each district was kept as a model farm. More than 3000 acres were in cultivation under Wheeler's own eye. The little Quaker meeting he established was visited by William Allen (1770&#150;1843), Stephen Grellett, and Thomas Shillitoe, with whom Wheeler in 1825 returned to Britain. He stayed for three months, and attended the Dublin and London yearly meetings.<br>
<br>About September 1828 Wheeler moved to Shoosharry, near St Petersburg, where visitors were almost unknown. The land, where he bored in vain for water, was on the edge of a huge bog. Wheeler's son William was now his assistant, and in 1830 Wheeler was able to visit Britain, where he held meetings in Yorkshire, Durham, Devon, Cornwall, Ireland, and the Isles of Scilly. On returning to Shoosharry in July 1831 he found cholera rife in the district, but out of his 500 employees none died. A year later he was allowed by an imperial ukase to resign his post in favour of his son.<br>
<br>To the monthly meeting at Doncaster on 23 September 1832 Wheeler unfolded his mission of gospel visits to the Pacific islands, New South Wales, and Van Diemen's Land. While making his preparations, his wife (who had remained in Russia) died. Accompanied by his son Charles, Wheeler set sail from the Thames on 13 November 1833 in the <i>Henry Freeling</i>, a cutter of 101 tons, which had been purchased and provisioned by private members of the Society of Friends. The ship arrived off Hobart Town on 10 September 1834, and left again in December, conveying James Blackhouse and George Washington Walker to Port Jackson and Norfolk Island on the way to Tahiti. During the four or five months spent on that island Wheeler held many services, sometimes on board his ship, with the queen and the chiefs, and with the missionaries, English residents, and crews of vessels in the harbour. Queen Pomare remitted the <i>Henry Freeling</i>'s port dues because Wheeler's was &#145;a visit of love, and not a trading voyage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 351). She again came to his meetings on the island of Eimeo.<br>
<br>Christmas day 1835 was spent in the Sandwich Islands, and the first Quaker meeting was held there, attended by native chiefs, the governor, and the queen. The <i>Henry Freeling</i> also stayed some time at Honolulu and at Rarotonga, the Friendly Islands, and New Zealand (Christmas 1836). On reaching Sydney in January 1837, the ship was sold and its company discharged. The ship's course was entirely without pre-arrangement, and was directed from day to day by Wheeler's spiritual intimations. In a letter to a friend Wheeler illustrates his sense of divine protection by saying that he has been ashamed, even in landing in canoes through the broken surf, to use a lifebelt which a friend had given him on leaving.<br>
<br>After leaving Hobart Town, Wheeler reached London on 1 May 1838. On returning his certificates to his quarterly meeting, Wheeler laid before them his wish to visit America. First he visited his surviving children at Shoosharry, and then travelled through Finland and Stockholm; finally he sailed for America from Liverpool in November 1838. He attended a number of the yearly meetings there, visited the place where Mary Dyer and other Quakers were executed, went to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, and returned to England in October 1839, hastened by the illness of his son Charles, who died at St Germains on his way south in the spring of the following year. Wheeler sailed for New York to complete his mission in May 1840 but caught a severe cold at sea, and died six weeks after landing, on 12 June 1840, in the house of his friend John Clapp. He was buried on 15 June in the Friends' burial-ground, Orchard Street, New York.<br>
<br>Wheeler's journals were edited by his son Charles in four parts (1835&#150;9), and in a consolidated volume (1839). <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life &hellip; of Daniel Wheeler</span> (1842) was edited by his son Daniel and was popular in several editions and versions. Wheeler's writings provide a vivid and quite candid account of a Quaker missionary's varied activities.<br>
