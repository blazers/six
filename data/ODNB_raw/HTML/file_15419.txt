<span class="headword">Si&ocirc;n Cent</span> <span class="st"> [John Kent]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1400&#150;1430), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, wrote a eulogy to the people and land of Brycheiniog (Brecon) which suggests a link with that area, and, although it was not necessarily his native region, the border area of south Wales was certainly his sphere of activity. Kent was a common enough surname in that area, and is not in itself proof of any link with the parish of Kentchurch in Herefordshire. The portrait at Kentchurch Court once thought to be of Si&ocirc;n Cent is now known not to be so. Si&ocirc;n Cent was not a professional bard, but clearly had some bardic training and made effective if unsophisticated use of the <i>cywydd</i> metre [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48659/', "Cywyddwyr (act. c.1330&#150;c.1650)")</script>]. It has been suggested that he was educated at Oxford University, where he would have been influenced by the empirical philosophy of <i>scientia experimentalis</i>, which may have provided a basis for his attack on the Platonic ideals of the Welsh bards. One of his most famous statements is &#145;Ystad bardd astudio byd&#146; (&#145;The estate of a poet is to study the world&#146;). Learned elements in his poems include references to ecclesiastical authorities such as Peter Lombard and detailed knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The only firm basis for dating Si&ocirc;n Cent's career is his debate with Rhys Goch Eryri, which was a consequence of Rhys's elegy on the death of Gruffudd Llwyd and subsequent debate with Llywelyn ab y Moel in the 1420s. Si&ocirc;n was not a young man at that time, and it seems therefore that the Glyn D&#373;r rebellion and its aftermath was his period of activity, a period which is reflected by the grim spirit of his poetry.<br>
<br>Si&ocirc;n Cent's critique of Rhys Goch Eryri's work focuses on the claim that the bardic muse was of divine origin, and he argues instead that the falsehoods of praise poetry prove it to be inspired by the devil. In keeping with this rejection of bardic ideals, Si&ocirc;n Cent's poems ruthlessly demonstrate the worthlessness of all the worldly values celebrated by the bards. Their emphasis is on the transience of life and the horrors of death, with the aim of turning people's attention away from this world to the next. The influence of the preaching friars is clear, and there are many parallels with the religious verse of medieval Europe. Si&ocirc;n Cent was the first Welsh poet to use the technique of the repeated refrain, which was certainly due to English influence. Although the bards took no account of his moral criticisms of their work, Si&ocirc;n Cent's influence on Welsh literature of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was considerable. There were clearly a number of other poets writing similar verse, whose work is falsely attributed to Si&ocirc;n Cent in the manuscripts on account of his fame as a religious poet. The attributions total close to one hundred poems, but of these only eighteen are now accepted as genuine.<br>
<br>Si&ocirc;n Cent the poet was later confused with several other figures of similar name and became a popular character in the folklore of the Welsh marches, famed as a trickster and wizard. Two of these misidentifications, in particular, seem to have contributed to his reputation for learning, namely those with <a name="cosubject_15418"></a><span class="headword">John Gwent</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1348), <span class="occ">Franciscan monk</span>, who died at Hereford, and <a name="cosubject_53844"></a><span class="headword">John Caerleon</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1482)<span class="occ"></span>, also apparently known as John Kent, who is said by Leland to have had a distinguished academic career at Cambridge in the fifteenth century.<br>
