<span class="headword">Pease, Sir  Arthur Francis</span>, first baronet  (1866&#150;1927), <span class="occ">coal owner and industrialist</span>, was born at Hummersknott, Darlington, on 11 March 1866, the eldest son of Arthur Pease, coal owner and MP, and his wife, Mary Lecky, daughter of Ebenezer Pike of Bessborough, co. Cork. He came from a Quaker family which had long been associated with industrial development in Durham and Yorkshire. He was the great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21728/', "Edward Pease")</script>, railway projector; grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21730/', "Joseph Pease")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21728/', "Pease, Edward")</script>], also a railway projector, and the first Quaker to sit in parliament; and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35447/', "Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, first baronet")</script>, of Hutton Lowcross and Pinchinthorpe, who for nearly forty years represented a Durham constituency in the House of Commons. Pease was educated at Brighton College, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and received a business training in Darlington with the family colliery concern, Pease &amp; Partners.<br>
<br>Pease was fortunate to avoid the financial catastrophe which afflicted the family bank, J. and J. W. Pease, in 1902, when negotiations for a takeover by Barclay &amp; Co. revealed the bank to be insolvent. Pease had earlier sold his interest in the business to his uncle, Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, whose estate was forfeited to meet liabilities in excess of &pound;400,000. A portion of this sum was owed to Pease &amp; Partners and it was owing to Arthur Francis Pease's acknowledged non-involvement in the bank's collapse that he was able to become chairman and managing director of that concern in 1906. In the course of time Pease became associated as chairman or director with numerous coalmining and other industrial undertakings in the north of England; he was also a director of Lloyds Bank and of the London and North Eastern Railway Company. In 1889 he married Laura Matilda Ethelwyn, daughter of Charles Peter Allix, of Swaffham Prior House, Cambridgeshire, who survived him; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Pease became known to the public as a prominent negotiator when an organized demand arose among miners for a minimum wage. He was one of three representatives of the Durham owners who served on the committee of coal owners which was appointed in 1912 to meet the government and the Miners' Federation. Subsequently, when the joint district board for Durham was set up under the <span class="roman">Minimum Wage Act</span> of 1912, Pease was called upon to state the case for the owners. After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Pease's great experience of industrial affairs was at once available for the government, and during the years 1914&#150;21 he was an active member of many government committees. He held office as second civil lord of the Admiralty from 1918 to 1919, and was created a baronet in 1920.<br>
<br>In the conduct of labour relations Pease departed from the principles of conciliation and arbitration which had informed Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease's stance as a negotiator in the Durham coal industry in the two decades before 1900. These were the years of &#145;Lib&#150;Labism&#146; when organized labour accepted a subordinate position in the hierarchy of liberal capitalism. As a unionist, Pease rejected this philosophy, especially in the years after 1906 when employers and trade unionists in the coal industry began to mobilize on a national basis in the face of declining productivity and profitability. In the great disputes of the 1920s Pease was a firm advocate of the view that, in the event of trade union opposition to wage reductions in response to trade depression, employers should resort to the tactics of the lock-out.<br>
<br>Pease devoted much time to the affairs of his native county. He was elected chairman of the Durham county council in 1922 and took an especial interest in education. He was a JP and a deputy lieutenant for the county of Durham, and in 1920 he served as high sheriff. During the First World War he helped to raise the 18th battalion of the Durham light infantry. Preoccupation with business affairs prevented him from seeking election to the House of Commons, but his strong political sympathies induced him to act as president of the Durham Unionist Association from the time of its formation in 1910. He was devoted to all forms of sport and was a regular follower of the Zetland hounds. Pease's health eventually became precarious as a result of overwork, and he died at his home, Middleton Lodge, Middleton Tyas, near Darlington, on 23 November 1927, after a cerebral haemorrhage during a meeting of directors. His son, Richard Arthur Pease, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
