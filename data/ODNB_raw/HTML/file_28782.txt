<span class="headword">Warren,  Joseph</span>  (1804&#150;1881), <span class="occ">composer and music editor</span>, was born in London on 20 March 1804. He first studied the violin, and then the piano and organ under J. Stone. At an early age he conducted a society of amateurs, for whom he wrote two symphonies and many other vocal and instrumental pieces. In 1834 he was appointed organist of St Mary's Roman Catholic Chapel, Chelsea, and composed several masses and smaller works for the services there, which remained in manuscript. However, some piano pieces of Warren's were published, and in 1840 he entered into an arrangement with the firm of Cocks &amp; Co., and edited or arranged a large quantity of music including collections of chants in 1840 (<span class="italic">A Selection of Cathedral Chants by the Old English Masters</span>), 1845, and <i>c</i>.1850, harmonizations of Bach's chorales (1842), a <span class="italic">Chorister's Handbook</span> (<i>c</i>.1850), and very many arrangements of works by prominent composers for the piano, harmonium, and concertina. He also wrote a number of useful short treatises on composition, orchestral writing, organ playing (2nd edn, <i>c</i>.1850), the harmonium (1855), and madrigal singing, and a method for the concertina (1855), which was very successful. Other works include <span class="italic">The Chanter's Hand-Guide</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">Warren's Psalmody</span> (1853, reissued <i>c</i>.1860).<br>
<br>Warren took an active part in the revival of early English music, an objective of the Oxford Movement, and in November 1843 began work on a new edition of Boyce's <span class="italic">Cathedral Music</span>, for which he is chiefly remembered, which was published in 1849. To the original he added a complete organ accompaniment and inserted extra services by Creyghton and Tomkins, movements from services by Blow, Child, and Aldrich, Parsons's burial service from Edward Lowe's <span class="italic">A Short Direction for the Performance of Cathedrall Service</span> (1661), anthems by Gibbons, Byrd, Blow, Tallis, and Tomkins, with some chants, and the symphonies to the anthems by Pelham Humfrey and Blow. Biographies of Boyce and the other composers represented are given, along with lists of their works. As an editor, Warren was careful and thorough, and his works were warmly praised by critics. In conjunction with John Bishop of Cheltenham, he also began in 1848 to issue a similar selection of early Italian, German, and Flemish music for the Catholic church, under the title <span class="italic">Repertorium musicae antiquae</span>, but only two parts appeared. They were equally good models of editing, as was the collection of John Hilton's <span class="italic">Ayres or Fa Las</span> (1844&#150;), which Warren edited for the Musical Antiquarian Society from the partbooks in his library.<br>
<br>Warren was an intimate friend of another pioneer of English musicology, Edward Francis Rimbault, although the two later appear to have become estranged and sneered in their prefaces at each other's publications. Warren fell into poverty late in life, and his valuable library, which included some of the most important early English manuscripts, sale catalogues, and autograph manuscripts of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, among others (his editions of Beethoven's <span class="italic">Christ at the Mount of Olives</span> and Rossini's <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span> had appeared in 1844), was parted with piece by piece. Around 1872 he became paralysed, and was apparently saved from destitution by the musicologist W. H. Cummings. He died at Bexley, Kent, on 8 March 1881.<br>
