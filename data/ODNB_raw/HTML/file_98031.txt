<span class="headword">Gerrard,  Edward</span>  (1810&#150;1910), <span class="occ">taxidermist</span>, was born in Oxford on 20 October 1810, the son of Edward Gerrard, greengrocer. After moving to London with his parents he was employed by the Zoological Society of London from 1836 as assistant to George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the society's museum. His work with the museum's collections of vertebrata was the basis of his zoological knowledge. He married, on 28 September 1837, Mary Ann (1814/15&#150;1846), daughter of James Maltby, tailor; they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In April 1841, encouraged by John Edward Gray, keeper of the zoological department of the British Museum, Gerrard joined that department as an attendant, working closely with Gray thereafter. One of his first jobs was to help move the collections from Montague House to the new museum buildings at Bloomsbury. Most of the existing exhibits of mammals consisted of mounted skins; Gerrard assisted Gray in building up collections of skeletons. Working in a damp cellar, and using a tray on his knees as a table, he compiled a manuscript catalogue of the osteological specimens, on which Gray's published catalogue (1847) was based. <span class="italic">The Catalogue of the Bones of Mammalia in the British Museum</span> (1862) was compiled by Gerrard under his own system of arrangement, and Gray put Gerrard's name on the title page, but was overruled by Richard Owen and the museum's trustees, who ordered that the name be erased  (Gray to Darwin, 21 Feb 1862, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 10.91). In 1862 Gerrard was elected an associate of the Linnean Society. He was employed by the British Museum as an attendant for fifty-five years, until his retirement in 1896.<br>
<br>About 1850, while still employed by the British Museum, Gerrard set up the family taxidermy and osteology business for which he became best known. Initially the business was based at the family home, 54 Queen's Street, Camden Town, in north London, but later moved to the yard behind 61 College Place, also in Camden Town. This was conveniently close to London Zoo, a focus for so many of the zoological luminaries of the day, and the Gerrard workshops soon became famous as a place where hunters, travellers, and naturalists met and exchanged or sold specimens. The juxtaposition of zoo and taxidermist was also advantageous as it ensured a regular supply of dead animals nearby, and during the heyday of British taxidermy, from about 1880 until 1914, Gerrard's business thrived in competition with dozens of other firms. The firm's speciality was preparing and articulating skeletons, used for teaching comparative anatomy.<br>
<br>A widower for over sixty years, Gerrard lived with his unmarried daughter, a schoolteacher. He had a strong constitution, and throughout his career walked daily, in all weathers, from Camden Town to the museum at Bloomsbury. He died at his home, 61 College Place, Camden Town, London, on 19 June 1910. His son, Edward (<i>b</i>. 1841), carried on the taxidermy business, which was passed down to two more generations of the family until it was wound up in 1967.<br>
