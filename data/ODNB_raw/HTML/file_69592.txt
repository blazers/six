<span class="headword">Roberts,  R.</span>  (<em>c.</em>1728&#150;1788), <span class="occ">translator and sermon writer</span>, was the daughter of William Roberts, of Bristol, earlier possessor of the manor of Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. William Hayward Roberts, a kinsman, was made a freeman of the city of Gloucester on 21 March 1761 and is described as &#145;clerk, son of Ric. esq. decd.&#146;  (Ripley, 131). His description of the family genealogy for three hundred years can be found on a marble tablet in Abergavenny church. She had at least one sister and two brothers: William, the author of <span class="italic">Thoughts upon Creation</span> (1782) and <span class="italic">Poetical Attempts</span> (1784), and Richard (1729?&#150;1823), high-master of St Paul's School, London, from 1769 to 1814.<br>
<br>Miss Roberts's earliest known work, titled <span class="italic">Select Moral Tales</span>, a translation of four tales from Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Marmontel's <span class="italic">Contes moraux</span>, was published in Gloucester in 1763. William Hayward Roberts's being a freeman of the city suggests that she spent most of her life there. Although very little is known of her life, it is also probable she was of, or on the fringe of, Hannah More's circle. Mary and Margaret Roberts, daughters of her brother William, were close friends of More. Mary, at the cost of severe burns on her hands, had saved More's life when her clothing caught on fire. Margaret was More's literary executor, and their brother William was the writer and compiler of the four-volume edition of <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Correspondence &hellip; of Hannah More</span> (1834). Both Mary and Margaret were remembered in More's will  (Hopkins, 250, 252). Miss Roberts was obviously strongly religious, for her next publication was <span class="italic">Sermons Written by a Lady, the Translatress of Four Select Tales from Marmontel</span> (1770). The book is less a collection of sermons than a conduct book of the conventional kind. As Miss Roberts stated, the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> were the result of a facetious remark by a clergyman to the effect that he would preach any sermon that she wrote. The critic for the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> referred to the anecdote about the clergyman and wrote in agreement: &#145;We must confess, we see no reason why ladies should not be oftener employed in writing sermons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, 30, 1770, 59&#150;63). The critic for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> also invoked the clergyman anecdote justifying the writing of sermons by women, but concluded: &#145;The candid will remember, that this is the work of a woman, and will not be very severe in their criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 43, 1770, 79). The <span class="italic">Sermons</span> were republished as <span class="italic">Seven Rational Sermons</span> in Philadelphia in 1777. On the heels of the <span class="italic">Sermons</span> Miss Roberts published an abridged translation of the abb&eacute; Claude-Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Millot's <span class="italic">&Eacute;lemens de l'histoire de France</span> (<span class="italic">Elements of the History of France</span>, 1771), which she hoped would be used by schoolgirls. <span class="italic">Elements of the History of England</span>, translated from Millot's French by Frances Brooke, appeared in the same year, raising the possibility that the two translators knew one another, or at least were aware of each other's work in progress. The reviewer of Miss Roberts's translation wrote: &#145;We must &hellip; admit his [Millot's] <span class="italic">Elements of the History of France</span> to be an useful abridgement of the subject, and at the same time acknowledge that the translator has done justice to the work.&#146; He also agreed that &#145;this abridgement is more proper than any other to be put into the hands of young ladies at school&#146;.<br>
<br>Miss Roberts's next venture, published in 1774, was another translation, that of Mme Fran&ccedil;oise de Graffigny's <span class="italic">Lettres d'une p&eacute;ruvienne</span> (2 vols., 1747) to which Miss Roberts added a third volume containing nine letters. Her religious bent ensured that the heroine of the novel, an Indian princess, converted to Christianity. The reviewer concluded that there would never be a better translation of the novel. Another of her works was advertised in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> of 7 August 1775: &#145;This day, the triumph of truth; or memoirs of M. De La Villette, translated from the French, Published by T. Cadell&#146;. It was &#145;undertaken at the request of the late Dr Hawkesworth, who revised and corrected the translation&#146;. Dedicated to the duchess of Devonshire, it was considered to be &#145;A proper book for boarding schools&#146;  (private information). Five years later, in 1779, Miss Roberts published <span class="italic">Malcolm</span>, a blank-verse tragedy which never saw the stage. Her last known work was <span class="italic">Albert, Edward, and Laura, and the Hermit of Priestland; Three Legendary Tales</span> (1783), for which Hannah More's &#145;Sir Eldred of the Bower&#146; was probably the model. The reviewer for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> was courteous but unimpressed, writing: &#145;We are sorry that justice will not permit us to speak in such terms of approbation as we could wish&#146;, adding that the <span class="italic">Tales</span> &#145;are composed of the usual ingredients&#151;love and murder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 69 [Oct. 1783], 342). Miss Roberts died on 14 January 1788.<br>
