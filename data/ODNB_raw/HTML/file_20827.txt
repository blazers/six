<span class="headword">Orford,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [Robert  of Oxford]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1280&#150;<em>c.</em>1293), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and theologian</span>, also known as Robertus de Colletorto or Guillelmus de Torto Collo in the manuscript tradition and as Robert of Oxford by English bibliographers, is known almost entirely through his surviving works. He was a member of a group of English Dominican friars at Oxford who defended the teachings of Thomas Aquinas after the condemnation of certain of them by the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Kilwardby, in 1277.<br>
<br>Orford's <span class="italic">Correctorium corruptorii &#145;Sciendum&#146;</span> was among the responses issued before 1284 to the Franciscan William de la Mare's <span class="italic">Correctorium</span> of Aquinas's alleged errors. <span class="italic">Sciendum</span> is a hurried work, noted for the mildness of its polemic. A chief cause of controversy was the question whether there was only one substantial form (the rational soul) in man, or a plurality. Orford argues against de la Mare for unicity of form, while rejecting Averroist arguments in favour of it; the influences of Giles of Rome and of Thomas Sutton can be detected. Sutton, the most distinguished of Orford's group, was possibly himself already influenced against Averroist arguments by Orford, if Orford wrote the <span class="italic">De natura materiae</span> formerly attributed to Aquinas.<br>
<br>Orford and his circle continued to defend Thomism after the renewal of the prohibition in 1284 by Kilwardby's successor, Archbishop John Pecham. From <i>c</i>.1284 to <i>c</i>.1286 he was responding as a bachelor of the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> to Richard Clive, fellow of Merton, and to the Franciscan Alan de Wakerfeld. It was not he, however, but his fellow Dominican Richard Knapwell (with whom Orford would have agreed on unicity of form while dissenting from his Averroist arguments) who was the main target of the condemnation of unicity as heretical, and of the excommunication of unicity's defenders, which were issued by Pecham in 1286.<br>
<br>Orford probably incepted as a master some time after 1285, when his group's concerns were broadening in response to the alternative metaphysics being developed in Paris by Giles of Rome and by Henri de Gand. In his <span class="italic">Contra dicta Fr. Aegidii Romani</span> (1288&#150;92) he manifests his irritation at Giles's apparent change of heart concerning Aquinas. However, his attack on Henri over the real distinction between essence and existence in the <span class="italic">Contra dicta Magistri Henrici de Gandavo</span> (1289&#150;93) still shows Giles's influence. Orford also criticized Henri on the soul and its faculties and on the creation of matter without form, but his work was overshadowed by Sutton's superior critique.<br>
<br>Though Orford's interest in Parisian theologians was common to his Oxford circle, it has suggested to some that he was in Paris at about the time of these writings or perhaps studied there earlier in life. It has also been suggested that he studied in Cambridge, but there is no evidence for this. He is last heard of preaching a university sermon in the Dominican church at Oxford on 22 February 1293, the second Sunday of Lent.<br>
