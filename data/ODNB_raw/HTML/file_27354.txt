<span class="headword">Thornton,  Edward Parry</span>  (1811&#150;1893), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, born on 7 October 1811 at Clapham Common, was second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27359/', "John Thornton (1783&#150;1861)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27362/', "Thornton, Samuel")</script>] of Clapham, commissioner of Inland Revenue, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of Edward Parry. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Haileybury College, where he was ranked second in his class. In 1830 he obtained a writership in Bengal. He was appointed assistant to Robert Merttins Bird, the commissioner of revenue in the Gorakhpur division in 1831. Here his first important task was to complete the Gorakhpur district settlement. He subsequently became the chief settlement officer of Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar, and in 1840 and 1841 published the settlement reports for each district. He enjoyed the unwavering support of Bird against those commissioners who retained reservations about the terms of the settlement regulations.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1840 he married Louisa Chicheliana (1816&#150;1883), daughter of Richard Chicheley Plowden of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Sophia Fleming. They had six sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Thornton returned to England on furlough early in 1842, and when he returned to India in 1845 was appointed joint magistrate and deputy collector at Meerut, and later in the same year chief magistrate and collector. In 1848 he was transferred in the same capacity to Saharanpur. In 1849, when Dalhousie was choosing the ablest officials for the task of organizing the Punjab, Thornton was appointed a commissioner and placed at Rawalpindi, in the Jhelum division. In 1852 he distinguished himself by his arrest of Nadir Khan, a discontented son of the raja of Mandla, who was endeavouring to promote a rising of the hill tribes. He received a bullet wound in the throat while executing his mission, but succeeded in preventing the rising. In May 1857, at the time of the mutiny, John, Lord Lawrence, made Rawalpindi his headquarters. Thornton was constantly with him, and he afterwards gave interesting details of Lawrence's conduct at that time, which have been preserved in Smith's <span class="italic">Life of Lord Lawrence</span> (1885). After Lawrence had taken the troops from the Punjab to assist in the operations against Delhi, Thornton was called on to exercise more independent authority. In the beginning of September 1857 the intelligence reached Lady Lawrence that the tribes in the lower Hazara country contemplated revolt. She communicated the report to Thornton, who succeeded in arresting the leaders within a few hours, and by this prompt action prevented any attempt at rebellion. On the conclusion of the mutiny Thornton was appointed judicial commissioner for the Punjab, and on 18 May 1860 he was made a companion of the Bath in recognition of his services. He retired from the Indian service in 1862, having been on extended leave on full salary since 1860. In retirement he joined the banking firm of H. S. Thornton.<br>
<br>Thornton died in London at his home, 61 Warwick Square, on 10 December 1893.<br>
<br>Several works on India commonly attributed to Thornton are by other writers of the same name, principally <a name="cosubject_27354"></a><span class="headword">Edward Thornton</span>  (1799&#150;1875)<span class="occ"></span>, who was at East India House from 1814 to 1857, and was head of the maritime department from 1847. Among his publications were gazetteers of the territories held by the East India Company and the &#145;countries adjacent to India on the North-West&#146;, and a six-volume <span class="italic">History of the British Empire in India</span> (1841&#150;5). He was also responsible for entries in the eighth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> on Indian subjects, which have also been attributed to Edward Parry Thornton. This Edward Thornton died at 1 Montpelier Street, Brighton, on 24 December 1875.<br>
