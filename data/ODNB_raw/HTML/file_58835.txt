<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Khan, Muhammad Iftikhar Ali</span>, nawab of Pataudi  (1910&#150;1952), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born in Pataudi in the Punjab on 16 March 1910, the elder son of Muhammad Ibrahim Ali Khan, the nawab of Pataudi (<i>d</i>. before 1927). The princely area of Pataudi, of which he was formally installed as ruler in December 1931, comprised some 53 square miles near Delhi with a population of nearly 19,000. He was educated at the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore, where he was coached by the Oxford blue M. G. Slater. After arriving in Britain in 1926 as a boy of sixteen, his cricket education was further enriched with coaching by the Kent and England batsman Frank Woolley.<br>
<br>Pataudi went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1927 and two years later won his university cricket blue. In the 1931 season he scored 1307 runs for the university at an average of 93 and entered the record books through his batting in that year's match against Cambridge. On the first day A. Ratcliffe of Cambridge set a new record for the fixture by scoring 201. Pataudi assured his exhausted colleagues that it would not last twenty-four hours and kept his word by scoring 238. His record still stands. The innings displayed his splendid eye for a cricket ball, the fluency of his stroke play, and his ability to score all round the wicket.<br>
<br>Pataudi toured Australia in 1932&#150;3 as part of Douglas Jardine's infamous &#145;bodyline&#146; tour, becoming the third of the remarkable trinity of Indian princes (after Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji) to play for England. On his d&eacute;but in the first test at Sydney in December 1932 he scored 102, a slow but valuable innings that helped England secure a ten-wicket victory. But he found relations with Jardine difficult, and after a poor performance in the second test was dropped. His next, and last, appearance for England was against Australia at Trent Bridge in June 1934. The brevity of his test career was despite the fact that in 1933 and 1934 he scored prodigiously for Worcestershire, hitting three double hundreds in 1933 and achieving an average of 91.33 a year later.<br>
<br>By then in poor health, Pataudi returned to India, where he was already part of a continuing web of intrigue to choose a cricket captain. For fifteen years he was seen in India as the captain across the water, a cricketing version of Banquo's ghost at the Indian captaincy table. He could have led India in 1932, when the country made its test d&eacute;but at Lord's, but after playing in one of the final trials he withdrew his name. More than a year before India's 1936 tour of England he accepted the Indian captaincy, only to change his mind, ostensibly on health grounds. In fact, as he privately disclosed, he could not face leading a side to &#145;please each community &hellip; and the rich patrons of the game&#146;  (Bose, <span class="italic">History</span>, 100). In 1939 he married Sajida Sultan, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31874/', "Sir Hamidullah Khan, the nawab of Bhopal")</script>. It was possibly the influence of his father-in-law that caused him suddenly before India's 1946 tour of England to emerge out of virtual retirement to claim the crown of the captaincy; at a time when the future of princes in an independent India was at stake, Bhopal thought it important that the team should be led by a princely figure. But although he scored heavily on the tour, averaging 46.71, Pataudi's highest score in the three test matches was 22 and he averaged just 11.00. His captaincy not only failed to live up to extravagant Indian hopes but also attracted well-merited English criticism.<br>
<br>India's independence a few months after the tour saw Pataudi lose his small principality, and thereafter he worked for the Indian foreign office. However, he still hankered after playing cricket and in November 1951 MCC approved his application to play for Worcestershire in 1952, which would have coincided with an Indian tour of England. But on 5 January 1952, while playing polo in Delhi, he had a heart attack and died. He had three daughters and a son, Mansur Ali, an eleven-year-old schoolboy in England at the time of his father's death, who was left to fulfil his father's ambitions and become one of India's best-loved captains.<br>
