<span class="headword">Seymour,  William Digby</span>  (1822&#150;1895), <span class="occ">judge</span>, third son of Charles Seymour, vicar of Kilronan, co. Roscommon, and his wife, Beata, daughter of Fergus Langley of Lich Finn, co. Tipperary, was born in co. Galway, Ireland, on 22 September 1822. He was educated at Edgeworthstown School and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he matriculated on 12 October 1838. He graduated BA in 1844 and LLD in 1872. He entered the Inner Temple on 2 May 1843 but transferred to the Middle Temple on 14 November 1845. He was called to the bar there on 12 June 1846, and practised on the northern circuit. On 1 September 1847 he married Emily, second daughter of Joseph John Wright, solicitor, of Sunderland.<br>
<br>Through the influence of his father-in-law Seymour was returned to parliament as one of the members for Sunderland in 1852, and his support of the Liberal Party was rewarded with the recordership of Newcastle in December 1854. On returning to his constituency for re-election he was defeated. In the meantime he had become connected with various commercial undertakings, notably with the Waller Goldmining Company, of which he was chairman in 1852. These undertakings were unsuccessful and in 1858 he had to make an arrangement with his creditors. In 1859 he was called before the benchers of the Middle Temple to answer charges affecting his character as a barrister in connection with some commercial transactions, and on 23 February was censured by the benchers  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22, 24, 25 Feb 1859 and 4 April 1859). Seymour disputed the fairness of the decision, but he would not publish the evidence, and he was excluded from the bar mess of the northern circuit. None the less, he won nominal damages for libel against the <span class="italic">Law Magazine</span> for giving a statement of the case with comments.<br>
<br>In May 1859 Seymour was returned for Southampton, securing Conservative support by a pledge not to vote against Derby's government. His failure to observe this promise was commented on by the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, and Seymour sought to institute a criminal prosecution of that paper, which was refused by Lord Campbell. He claimed to favour an extension of the franchise, provided that this was accompanied by the protection of the ballot, and was opposed to all special religious endowments. Seymour was named a queen's counsel in the county palatine of Lancaster in August 1860, and on 19 February 1861 a queen's counsel for England by Lord Campbell. In the same year he was employed by the government to draw up the <span class="roman">Admiralty Reform Act</span>.<br>
<br>Seymour's views grew gradually more Conservative; he unsuccessfully contested Hull in 1857, Southampton in 1865, Nottingham in 1869 and 1870, Stockton in 1880, and South Shields in 1885. Through the influence of his political friends in August 1889 he became judge of the county court circuit no. 1, with his chief court at Newcastle upon Tyne. He held that appointment until his death at Tynemouth, Northumberland, on 16 March 1895.<br>
<br>Seymour published two works on land investment in Ireland as well as texts on shipping law and a translation of the Hebrew psalter.<br>
