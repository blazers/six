<span class="headword">Utley,  Thomas Edwin <span class="st"> [Peter]</span></span>  (1921&#150;1988), <span class="occ">journalist and political analyst</span>, was born on 1 February 1921 in Hawarden, Flintshire, the second of five children (two sons, two daughters, and one deceased in infancy) of Thomas Cooper, chemist, of West Derby, Liverpool, and his wife, Emily Utley. In 1931 he was adopted by his maternal aunt, Anne Utley, by whose surname he was thenceforward known. He was born blind in one eye owing to infantile glaucoma and lost the sight of the other eye at the age of nine, but, with the help of a series of amanuenses, courageous determination, and a prodigious memory, offset this handicap almost completely in adult life. Educated privately, Utley took first-class honours in both parts one (1941) and two (1942) of the history tripos at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Utley joined the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) in 1942, as secretary to the Anglo-French relations post-war reconstruction group, and worked there until 1944, when he became a temporary foreign leader writer at <span class="italic">The Times</span> for one year. From 1945 to 1947 he was foreign leader writer at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. He spent a year at <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1947&#150;8, and then rejoined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a leader writer. He stayed there for six years, becoming associate editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1954&#150;5. He married in 1951 Brigid Viola Mary (1927&#150;2012), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31466/', "Dermot Michael Macgregor Morrah")</script>, journalist, historian, and Arundel herald-extraordinary. There were two sons and two daughters of the marriage. In 1955 Utley began life as a freelance journalist and broadcaster, until in 1964 he joined the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> as a leader writer. He was that newspaper's chief assistant editor in 1986&#150;7. From 1987 until his death a year later he was obituaries editor and a columnist at <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Utley's frequently signed articles on political subjects gained for him a widespread reputation as a political philosopher, and during his later years he was regarded as its most articulate and reflective exponent by that wing of the Conservative Party which designated itself distinctively as high tory. The party in general during the last twenty years of his life was influenced more than it might have cared to admit by the views expressed in Utley's leading and other articles in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>.<br>
<br>Never inclined to inhabit an ivory tower, Utley served as chairman of the Paddington Conservative Association in 1977&#150;9 (president, 1979&#150;80) and as consultant director (1980&#150;88) of the research department of Conservative central office; but his only venture into practical politics, when he contested Antrim North at the general election of February 1974 against the sitting Democratic Unionist member, Ian Paisley, proved abortive. Northern Ireland was one of the many subjects to which he brought his ability to provide policy with a well-developed structure of logically sustainable argument; but this quality was most practically effective during the premiership (1979&#150;90) of Margaret Thatcher, who held him in high regard. In some degree he paved the way intellectually for the changes in the direction of Conservative policy which she initiated and implemented. He also had an unswerving religious belief, and regretted changes to the Church of England which would damage its careful compromises.<br>
<br>A collection of Utley's signed publications appeared after his death under the title <span class="italic">A Tory Seer</span> (ed. Charles Moore and Simon Heffer, 1989). His own books included <span class="italic">Modern Political Thought</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Not Guilty: the Conservative Reply</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Occasion for Ombudsman</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Your Money and your Life</span> (1964), <span class="italic">Enoch Powell: the Man and his Thinking</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">Lessons of Ulster</span> (1975). His influence was magnified by the spellbinding effect which his fluent and incisive discourse produced, especially upon young hearers. It was not without significance that the group of younger officials who sat at his feet at the Conservative Research Department became known as the &#145;Utley play school&#146;.<br>
<br>Utley (known to his many friends as Peter) was of striking, if frail, appearance; and those introduced to him sensed no disposition on his part to conceal the severity of the disability under which he laboured. He wore a black patch over his right eye. An inveterate smoker, unable to see where he flicked his ash, he caused Margaret Thatcher to bob up and down from her chair to move the ashtray in order to preserve the carpets.<br>
<br>Utley was overtaken by a cancer-induced stroke while working at his home, and died the following evening at the Cromwell Hospital, London, on 21 June 1988. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 24 October 1988.<br>
