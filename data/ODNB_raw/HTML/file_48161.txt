<span class="headword">Grey,  Henry</span>, first Baron Grey of Groby  (1547&#150;1614), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was the only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11548/', "Lord John Grey (d. 1564)")</script> of Pirgo, Essex, and Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3667/', "Anthony Browne, first Viscount Montagu of Cowdray, Sussex")</script>. He was probably educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where a Henry Grey graduated BA on 1 February 1565 and MA on 18 June 1568. He married Anne (1542&#150;1605), daughter of William, second Lord Windsor of Bradenham, Buckinghamshire, about 1575 and was knighted on 11 November 1587. He was appointed one of the queen's gentleman pensioners in 1569 and was lieutenant of the band from 1589 to 1603. In 1596 he was also made master of the queen's buckhounds. James I raised him to the peerage on 21 July 1603, when he was created Baron Grey of Groby, Leicestershire, and as a quid pro quo he was forced to resign his lieutenancy of the gentleman pensioners in September. He served as knight of the shire for Essex in 1589.<br>
<br>Grey's main ambition during Elizabeth's reign was to re-establish his family's position in Leicestershire. His father had suffered attainder in 1554 for his involvement in Wyatt's rebellion. Elizabeth released him from this in 1559 and also granted him the manor of Pirgo, which became his principal residence. Henry succeeded to the estate on his father's death in 1564 and divided his time between his duties at court&#151;where he was required to attend on the queen for six months of the year&#151;and local government in Essex. At court he enjoyed the favour of Lord Burghley and his son Sir Robert Cecil, and in 1588 he figured in a list of those considered suitable for baronies. Nothing came of this, but by the end of Elizabeth's reign he had managed to reacquire most of his family's estates in Leicestershire, centred on Bradgate Park and the manor of Groby. As a local governor he provided a valuable link between the court and the localities. Grey was put on to the commission of the peace for Essex (<i>c</i>.1573), served as deputy lieutenant (1586&#150;90), and was described in 1600 as the county's senior justice. His election to parliament for Essex in 1589 was secured by the intervention of the privy council, which dissuaded Lord Rich from backing a rival candidate. At Westminster he participated in the committee on purveyance and attended the queen with a petition from the Commons to curb abuses by purveyors.<br>
<br>After his promotion to a barony and his resignation from the gentleman pensioners Grey took up residence at Bradgate and devoted most of his energies to strengthening his family's position in Leicestershire. This involved reviving the feud between the Greys and the Hastings earls of Huntingdon which had divided the shire for much of the early sixteenth century. When the fourth earl of Huntingdon died in December 1604, Grey immediately wrote to Cecil asking that he be granted his lord lieutenancy and other county offices as compensation for surrendering his lieutenancy of the gentleman pensioners. The fifth earl, who was a minor, protested and Cecil sided with him, agreeing to put the lord lieutenancy in abeyance until he came of age. In the meantime Grey joined forces with the Beaumont family and sought to dominate the county in other ways. He became the leading spokesman for the justices in their dealings with central government and engineered changes in the commission of the peace at the expense of the Hastings faction. The struggle intensified when Huntingdon reached his majority in 1607 and took over the main posts in local government. Grey attacked him on two fronts, questioning his management of purveyance in the county during 1610 and 1611 and then in 1612 backing an inquiry into the earl's nomination of John Bale to the commission of the peace. His cause was badly damaged by the sudden death from smallpox of his son Sir John Grey in October 1611, which removed his main source of support at court. In both instances Huntingdon was successful in seeing off the challenge and by the time of Grey's death Huntingdon was firmly in control of the shire. Grey's wife having died in 1605 (she was buried on 28 June at St Mary's, Broughton Astley, Leicestershire), he was reported as seeking to marry the widow of Sir John Wood  (McClure, 314).<br>
<br>There is little direct evidence about Grey's religious views, but he appears to have inherited the staunchly protestant attitude of his father. When a group of puritan ministers in Leicestershire was threatened with deprivation in January 1605, his name headed the list of local JPs petitioning Cecil for leniency. He was also closely associated with Francis White, minister at the Grey living of Broughton Astley. White was later to become an apologist for Arminianism, but at this stage in his career was making his reputation as an anti-papal polemicist.<br>
<br>Grey had four sons and four daughters. He died on 26 July 1614 at Bradgate Park and was buried in the family chapel there. He was succeeded by his grandson, Henry, a minor who later became earl of Stamford.<br>
