<span class="headword">Hendry,  James Findlay</span>  (1912&#150;1986), <span class="occ">poet and essayist</span>, was born James Hendry (he later added Findlay, derived from his mother's maiden name) in Balgrayhill, Dennistoun, Glasgow, on 12 September 1912. He was the first child of John McEwen Hendry (1881&#150;1945), master butcher, and his wife, Christina McMillan Finlay (1886&#150;1967), who were both from Glasgow. He had a younger sister, Mamie, and a brother, Ian. In his one published novel, <span class="italic">Fernie Brae: a Scottish Childhood</span> (1947, completed 1938), Hendry recalled his final years at Whitehill School, Dennistoun, and his first years at Glasgow University (1930&#150;32): David Macrae, the novel's central protagonist, closely articulates Hendry's own Scottish intellectual and cultural preoccupations, consciously paralleling James Joyce's <span class="italic">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>. For all his access to formal education, Hendry retained characteristics of the classic autodidact, being both self-informed and unorthodox. As a schoolboy he was fascinated with languages, and joined Hugh Brennan's evening class in Russian. Brennan, who later became a mentor to Hendry, subsequently taught him at Glasgow University, where Hendry's principal subjects were initially French and German. Wary of academic philosophy from the extensive reading he continued all his life, promiscuously independent rather than scholarly, he was permitted to study &#145;political economy&#146; as an alternative to the otherwise compulsory course in philosophy. In the summer of 1932, and before an obligatory study year in Paris, Hendry visited the Soviet Union on a package tour. Here private conversations with Russians deepened his own reservations about the Soviet regime's official commentary.<br>
<br>Rather than completing the course for his Glasgow MA, in 1933 Hendry went to Vienna to study at the Consular Academy. He fell in love with the city, and with a fellow student, Theodora (Dee) Ussai (1905&#150;1941), a Slovenian emigr&eacute; to the USA, where he later travelled to visit her. They married in Glasgow on 25 December 1936. With a child expected 
    (David, <i>b</i>. 1938)
  , Hendry worked briefly, and unhappily, as a civil servant with the Inland Revenue in Leeds, where the family lived between 1937 and 1940. By then he had begun to publish verse and make significant literary contacts, editing with its publisher C. J. Russell a pamphlet of new Scottish verse: <span class="italic">Albannach</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Hendry is now best-known for his work with Henry Treece as an editor of, and contributor to, three anthologies of verse and prose, <span class="italic">The New Apocalypse</span> (1939, for which Hendry was solely responsible), <span class="italic">The White Horseman</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">The Crown and the Sickle</span> (1945). In this capacity he emerged as an initiator and leader of a loose affiliation of writers, known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96344', "New Apocalypse")</script>, which was critical of the 1930s literary school of W. H. Auden, and others, and concerned by moves towards abstraction in the arts and totalitarianism in politics. The New Apocalypse &#145;movement&#146; was less a co-ordinated, positive programme than a bringing together and promotion of works by writers with shared artistic and intellectual sympathies. As Hendry explained in &#145;Writers and apocalypse&#146;, his introduction to <span class="italic">The New Apocalypse</span>, these sympathies went beyond literary considerations to address the dangers of mechanization and the restrictions placed on human initiative by what he considered the false prestige and impersonality of science, at the expense of myth and subjectivity. In response Hendry championed apocalyptic writing as &#145;the war for justice to man&#146; measured in the ability to express the emotional and intellectual organicism of &#145;the whole man&#146;. The importance here of William Blake should also be noted, and Hendry planned but did not complete a subsequent study of Blake. Hendry's own fiction and verse reflected models he knew in languages other than English: the prose of Boris Pasternak and Ivan Bunin (as seen in <span class="italic">Fernie Brae</span>), or the Spanish poets of 1927 who deplored outright rejection of the seventeenth-century poet G&oacute;ngora (<span class="italic">The Bombed Happiness</span>, 1942; <span class="italic">Orchestral Mountain</span>, 1943). Hendry's praise in &#145;Writers and apocalypse&#146; for the work of Dylan Thomas, in whose poetry and prose he identified a &#145;definite organic purpose&#146; and an appreciation of &#145;wholeness and roundedness&#146;, identified values central to his understanding of the New Apocalypse, with which Thomas himself was not involved.<br>
<br>In September 1939 Hendry and Theodora travelled to Yugoslavia, where they visited her relatives and Hendry made contacts and recorded political observations for private circulation and publication. The tales and sketches in <span class="italic">The Blackbird of Ospo</span> (1942) vividly express Slovenia's pre-war predicament, divided between Yugoslavia and fascist Italy. During his visit Hendry was interrogated by the Yugoslav authorities, who suspected him of being an American agent. In Britain he was later interrogated as a suspected Soviet agent. The trip&#151;which Hendry had been led to believe would benefit his prospects&#151;had been suggested by John Cairncross, a sometime university friend and former Foreign Office official, now at the Treasury. Hendry's relatives and friends recalled his conviction that Cairncross had been a Soviet agent; and, indeed, after Hendry's death Cairncross's identity as a former Soviet spy became a matter of public knowledge.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war Hendry joined the army in 1940. On 31 March 1941, on an extension of compassionate leave, he witnessed his wife's death in physical and mental agony from terrible internal injuries sustained during the London blitz. Hendry returned to this most devastating period of his life in his final years, in a long allegorical novel, &#145;The Wild and the Beautiful&#146; (unpublished). In 1944 he was posted as a translator to an Italian prisoner-of-war camp in the Lake District, and met Dorothy Stainton (1915&#150;2004). They married in St Thomas's Church, Milnthorpe, Westmorland, on 3 July 1944, and had a daughter and a son. In addition to volumes of poetry and his study of Yugoslavia, the war years also saw the publication of the <span class="italic">Penguin Book of Scottish Short Stories</span> (1943), edited by Hendry and his late wife, which maintained a rule of lengthy delay between completion of a book and its publication.<br>
<br>Hendry remained in the army, working as a translator in the British administration in Vienna, until 1950. After his discharge he finally graduated MA at Glasgow University (1952), trained as a teacher, and taught at St Mungo's Academy, Glasgow, and at the university's Institute for Soviet and East European Studies. In 1962 the Hendry family moved to Geneva, where Hendry worked as a translator for, among other bodies, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Hendry moved to Canada in 1968 following his appointment as professor and founding head of the School of Translators and Interpreters at Laurentian University, Ontario. Here he taught Russian, published <span class="italic">Your Future in Translating and Interpreting</span> (1969), and studied issues of the standardization of official terminology. He retired from his university post in 1977. Receipt of his pension remained conditional on his residence in Canada until 1987, though he was able to spend summers in Glasgow even if he was not, as he wished, able to live permanently in Scotland. There followed a number of publications, including essays, collections of verse (<span class="italic">Marimarusa</span>, 1978; <span class="italic">A World Alien</span>, 1980), and a biography of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke (<span class="italic">The Sacred Threshold</span>, 1982) drafted while he lived in Geneva. Hendry died of a heart attack, in his sleep, at his home, 343 Lawrence Avenue West, Toronto, on 18 December 1986. He was buried on 22 December at the city's North York cemetery, where his bones rest beside those of many Slovenes. Hendry's prepared <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> remains unpublished, along with several works of fiction, and an extended study of the linguistic preoccupations of a lifetime. Since 2000 there have been flickers of new interest in his work.<br>
