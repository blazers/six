<span class="headword">Clark,  Frederick Le Gros</span>  (1892&#150;1977), <span class="occ">social and industrial reformer</span>, was born on 3 September 1892 in Chislet, Kent, the eldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of the Revd (Edward) Travers Clark, of Washfield, Tiverton, Devon, and his wife, Ethel May, daughter of Edward Clapton, a physician. Both grandfathers were on the staff of St Thomas's Hospital. One of his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30935/', "Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark")</script>, was professor of anatomy in Oxford and London; the other brother, when chief secretary to the government of Sarawak, was killed during the Second World War. His sister worked for the Red Cross. From Blundell's School, Tiverton, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1911 and graduated with a second class in classical honour moderations in 1913. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he joined the Middlesex regiment as a private: by the end of the war he was a lieutenant in the 3rd Hampshire regiment. On the last day of the war, as a result of an accident, he lost his right hand and eye. His left eye was so seriously damaged that he gradually became completely blind. In 1921 he married Ida Searle and, after her death, he married in 1952 Winifred Collier. There were no children.<br>
<br>By 1941 Clark had published two novels and seventy short stories; some of these were collected in <span class="italic">The Adventures of the Little Pig</span> (1937). But he never thought of writing as his profession. Because of his interest in the psychology of blindness, and his wish to help others to cope with it, he wrote some articles in the <span class="italic">St Dunstan's Review</span> on his own experience and on how he organized his work and thoughts. His later thoughts on these matters were collected in <span class="italic">Blinded in War</span> (1969). He wrote clearly and concisely, typing the first draft himself hastily and then rewriting extensively. He had a remarkable memory and trained it assiduously. He was proud of what independence he could manage. On coming into a house which he had already visited once or twice, he would ask if there had been any rearrangement: on being reassured, he would demonstrate his spatial memory by moving confidently and unguided. He enjoyed walking on country roads when traffic was sparse during the Second World War, guided only by his companion's voice.<br>
<br>By 1930 Clark had found his vocation to be working on problems connected with welfare and nutrition. After two visits to the USSR he wrote (with L. N. Brinton) <span class="italic">Men, Medicine and Food in the USSR</span> (1936). He was the prime mover in starting the Committee against Malnutrition, which called attention to the extent of malnutrition in Britain in the 1930s. In this work he had active encouragement from Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins and Sir John Boyd Orr. He was secretary of the Children's Nutrition Council and edited the <span class="italic">Nutrition Bulletin</span> of the National Council for Health Education.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Feeding the Human Family</span> (1947) Clark gave a brief history of nutritional research, commented on the conflict between the commercial interest of food producers and our nutritional requirements, described the discussions which preceded the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and discussed themes such as soil erosion which only later had general recognition. In <span class="italic">Four Thousand Million Mouths</span> (which he edited with N. W. Pirie, 1951) a group of scientists argued that, by full application of existing knowledge, enough food for such a population could be produced. He was, briefly, a consultant to FAO on school feeding; earlier he had had a grant from the Leverhulme Trust for similar studies.<br>
<br>Aided by grants from the Nuffield Foundation, Clark started a prolonged study of the part played by tradition and preconceptions, rather than incapacity, in fixing the age of retirement. Among his other publications on this subject were: <span class="italic">Ageing in Industry</span> (with A. C. Dunne, 1955), <span class="italic">Growing Old in a Mechanized World</span> (1960), and <span class="italic">Women, Work and Age</span> (1962). Much of his work was given limited circulation in Nuffield Foundation reports. The general conclusion was that most workers accepted retirement at sixty-five unwillingly, largely because they feared that it would lead to physical and mental deterioration.<br>
<br>Publications in braille covered little of the literature Clark consulted. He therefore needed co-operation from sighted people who understood what they were asked to read. This help was willingly given by his many friends, because of his friendly personality and shrewd and amusing comments. Politically he was to the left: a member of the Association of Scientific Workers and a committee member of Science for Peace. Those who knew him through science called him Bill, a nickname bestowed during the First World War because of a fancied resemblance to the cartoon character Old Bill. To those who knew him through St Dunstan's he was Clarkie.<br>
<br>Clark took his Oxford MA in 1944 and was given an honorary DSc by Bristol University in 1972. He died in Cambridge on 22 September 1977 soon after becoming partly paralysed.<br>
