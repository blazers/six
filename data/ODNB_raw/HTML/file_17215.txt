<span class="headword">Lushington,  Stephen Rumbold</span>  (1776&#150;1868), <span class="occ">politician and administrator in India</span>, was born at Bottisham, Cambridgeshire, on 6 May 1776. He was the fourth son of James Stephen Lushington of Rodmersham, Kent, vicar of Newcastle upon Tyne and prebendary of Carlisle, and second son of his father's second wife, Mary, daughter of the Revd Humphrey Christian of Docking, Norfolk.<br>
<br>Lushington was educated at Rugby School and the Linton Academy, Cambridgeshire, and in 1791 obtained a writership in the East India Company's Madras service. In 1792 he was appointed assistant in the military, political, and secret department; in 1794, deputy Persian translator to the government; in 1796, deputy secretary to the board of revenue; and in 1798, secretary and Persian translator to the board of revenue. From 1795 to 1799 he was private secretary to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12387/', "General George Harris (afterwards first Baron Harris)")</script>, commander-in-chief of Madras and conqueror of Mysore, and in 1797 married Harris's eldest daughter, Anne Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1856), with whom he had six sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In January 1803, after four years as a district collector in Ramnad and Tinnevelly, Lushington was appointed registrar of the <i>sadr</i> and <i>faujdari adalat</i>. Later that year, however, he returned to England and settled on an estate in Kent procured for him by General Harris. In 1807 Harris propelled him into parliament as the conservative member for Rye, a seat purchased with Lord Wellesley's aid on the understanding that Lushington would use his parliamentary privilege to champion Wellesley and Harris's record of conquest in India. In 1812 he was returned for Canterbury, which seat he continued to hold until 1830. He was chairman of the committee of ways and means from 1810 until 1813, and, under Lord Liverpool's administration, joint secretary of the Treasury from 1814 until 1827. In 1827 he became a privy councillor and was appointed governor of Madras.<br>
<br>Lushington's predecessor in Madras had been Sir Thomas Munro (1761&#150;1827) and Lushington soon quarrelled with Munro's acolytes, notably Henry Sullivan Graeme and David Hill. Schooled in the Cornwallis tradition of permanent settlement, he disliked Munro's famous ryotwari settlement and also his proposal for criminal trials by Indian juries. His tussle with Munro's supporters, however, was not essentially one of principle, but an attempt to stamp his own authority on an entrenched administrative cadre. He was accused, with justification, of jobbery and nepotism, instances of which stood out all the more against the background of stringent economies he introduced in order to reduce Madras's deficit before the company's charter came up for renewal in 1833.<br>
<br>Lushington returned to England in 1832 at the end of his five-year term. Having refused to surrender his Canterbury seat on his appointment to Madras, he had lost it in the general election of 1830. He regained it in 1835 but retired from parliament at the dissolution of 1837. He was created an honorary DCL of Oxford in 1839 and in 1840 published a biography of his father-in-law, <span class="italic">The Life and Services of General Lord Harris</span>. His first wife died in 1856, after which he married, in 1858, Marianne, daughter of James Hearne of Great Portland Street, London. There were no children of this marriage and Marianne died in 1864. Lushington himself died at his residence, Norton Court, Norton, near Faversham, Kent, on 5 August 1868, aged ninety-two.<br>
<br>Lushington's younger brother <a name="cosubject_17212"></a><span class="headword">Sir James Law Lushington</span>  (1779&#150;1859)<span class="occ"></span> obtained a cadetship in the Madras army in 1796 and was promoted to colonel, 3rd Madras light cavalry, in 1829 and general in 1854. Elected a director of the East India Company in 1827, he served as vice-chairman of the court of directors in 1837&#150;8, 1841&#150;2, and 1847&#150;8, and chairman in 1838&#150;9, 1842&#150;3, and 1848&#150;9. He was created CB in 1829, KCB in 1837, and GCB in 1838. A tory, he represented in succession Petersfield (1825&#150;6), Hastings (1826&#150;7), and Carlisle (1827&#150;31) in the House of Commons. In 1836 he married Rosetta Sophia Costen; the marriage produced no children. He died at his residence in London, 26 Dorset Square, on 29 May 1859, and was survived by his wife.<br>
