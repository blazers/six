<span class="headword">Voynich <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Boole]</span>,  Ethel Lilian <span class="st"> [Lily; </span></span> <span class="st"> E. L. V.]</span>  (1864&#150;1960), <span class="occ">novelist, translator, and musician</span>, was born on 11 May 1864 at Lichfield Cottage, Blackrock, Ballintemple, near Cork, the youngest daughter of the mathematician and logician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2868/', "George Boole (1815&#150;1864)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38817/', "Mary Boole, n&#233;e Everest (1832&#150;1916)")</script>, niece of Sir George Everest after whom the mountain is named. Soon left a widow, the gifted but eccentric Mary Boole took her five young daughters to London, where she worked as a librarian at Queen's College, managed a student hostel, taught mathematics, and wrote about impossible philosophies.<br>
<br>Lily Boole was a sensitive child, with searching eyes and a head of golden hair. She early showed a gift for music and a love of poetry. At the age of eight she developed erysipelas and was sent to an uncle in Lancashire, who treated her harshly but ensured her progress on the piano; she also spent periods in Ireland and Cornwall. Of a religious but romantic disposition, she was fascinated by Lamennais and Mazzini (in imitation of whom she wore black, in mourning for the world). In 1882 she received a small inheritance which enabled her to study piano for three years at the Hochschule der Musik in Berlin; she then lived in Paris for a while. She returned to England an atheist and radical, eager to view nihilism in Russia. She sought introductions from &eacute;migr&eacute;s including Prince P. A. Kropotkin and Stepniak (Sergey Kravchinsky), whose <span class="italic">Underground Russia</span> (1883) had been a revelation to her. Stepniak taught her enough Russian to travel about his country meaningfully in 1887&#150;9, which she did while teaching English and music and living on the fringe of revolutionary circles.<br>
<br>In 1890 the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom was founded in London and Stepniak became editor of its journal, <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>. Lily Boole joined the committee and laboured tirelessly, translating Russian tales as well as works by Stepniak himself; he considered her an outstanding translator and introduced her <span class="italic">Stories from Garshin</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">The Humour of Russia</span> (1895). Through him she had meanwhile met and then, by some accounts, married in the summer of 1892 (a formal marriage was not registered until 1902) the colourful Polish refugee Wilfrid Michael Voynich or Habdank-Wojnicz (1865&#150;1930), who helped create the Russian Free Press Fund. E. L. V. (as she was now commonly called) worked energetically for this, holding her own in debate with volatile male revolutionaries. Some thought her domineering, but many recognized the talent soon to find expression in <span class="italic">The Gadfly</span> (1897). The idea for this novel had crystallized at the Louvre in 1885 in front of a portrait of a young man in black, by the sixteenth-century Florentine painter Franciabigio, a reproduction of which E. L. V. cherished until her death. She researched the historical background in Florence in the summer of 1895. Although she maintained her only direct models for <span class="italic">The Gadfly</span> to be Lamennais (for Montanelli) and Kropotkin's comrade Charlotte Wilson (for Gemma), it is said that she went to Italy with a lover, Sigmund Rosenblum&#151;the future spy Sidney Reilly&#151;and used him in the delineation of her hero.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Gadfly</span>, an evocation of the Risorgimento, has a delirious, Dostoyevskian intensity. Its plot is melodramatic and its language sentimental, but it derives astonishing moral power from its clear statement of right and wrong. It proved popular with socialists, especially in Russia, where it was translated in 1898. Shaw safeguarded E. L. V.'s dramatic rights by producing it as a play; Conrad claimed to hate it; Lawrence pronounced it excellent but disliked its treatment of pain. The lack of authorial tact in <span class="italic">The Gadfly</span> is actually its strength, because offset by triumphant historical reality; by contrast, E. L. V.'s fiercely anti-clerical <span class="italic">Jack Raymond</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Olive Latham</span> (1904), novels of undeniable passion and power, do appear to wallow in man's beastliness to man, and morbidity is seen also in <span class="italic">An Interrupted Friendship</span> (1910), which reverted to the subject and character of the Gadfly.<br>
<br>Wilfrid Voynich lost interest in revolution and became a successful rare-book dealer. During the First World War he shifted from London to New York; E. L. V. followed only in 1920, having stayed behind to do social work with the Quakers. In the United States she devoted herself to music, for which she said her writings had been only a prelude. She translated (1931) <span class="italic">Chopin's Letters</span>, adding an idiosyncratic preface; taught piano and composition; and wrote much music of her own, mostly circulated privately, including part-songs, motets, the oratorio <span class="italic">Babylon</span>, and the cantatas <span class="italic">Epitaph in Ballad Form</span> and <span class="italic">The Submerged City</span>.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Ethel Voynich returned briefly to her Gadfly with the novel <span class="italic">Put off thy Shoes</span> (1945). <span class="italic">The Gadfly</span> itself was meanwhile becoming an icon of communism: it was translated into eighteen languages of the USSR and operas were based on it, as well as the celebrated film with music by Shostakovich; Soviet readers ranked its author among the world's great novelists. Only in 1955, quite by chance, was she made aware of this, but she soon received Soviet royalties, then a mark of exceptional regard. <span class="italic">The Gadfly</span> was revived in the English-speaking world, Bertrand Russell declaring it one of the most exciting novels he had ever read.<br>
<br>Ethel Lilian Voynich died of pneumonia during the night of 27 July 1960 at Apartment 17, London Terrace, 450 West 24th Street, New York, where she had resided for much of her thirty years' widowhood.<br>
