<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  Richard Arthur Surtees</span>, second baronet  (1869&#150;1955), <span class="occ">barrister and scientific investigator</span>, was born at Cranmore Hall, Somerset, on 13 January 1869, the eldest son of Sir Richard Horner Paget, first baronet (1832&#150;1908), of Cranmore, MP, and his wife, Caroline Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of Henry Edward Surtees, of Redworth Hall, co. Durham. He was educated at Eton College and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a third class in chemistry in 1891; he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1895, and succeeded his father in 1908.<br>
<br>Paget's legal and scientific background, together with his engaging personal qualities, fitted him admirably for such tasks as secretary to several boards and committees, including the patent law committee (1900) and the submarine and electrical section of the Admiralty board of invention and research (1915&#150;18). He contributed to both scientific and artistic departments of knowledge, such as acoustics, music, architecture, town planning, agriculture, anthropology, and human speech, besides cultivating practical music and artistic crafts such as pottery and drawing. His penetrating foresight made him appear ahead of his time. This was certainly true with regard to the streamlined car he designed in 1910, and to some aspects of speech: his book, <span class="italic">Human Speech</span>, first published in 1930, was reissued in 1964 because of its connection with developments in communication engineering.<br>
<br>Paget's most important original investigations were those connected with language, not only in regard to phonetics and the technique of vocalization, or linguistics and vocabulary&#151;to all of which he added new conceptions&#151;but in the most fundamental processes and means through which individuals can transfer ideas from one to another. His famous theory of pantomimic action of the tongue and lips explained lucidly how language arises at all and related it directly to the senses and affections. From this followed naturally his special interest in the communication problems of deaf mute people. He laid down the principles for an entirely new approach in communication with deaf and deaf mute people by means of a systematic sign language, the further development of which was continued after his death.<br>
<br>Paget was well equipped for work in language and speech as he possessed a remarkable musical aural sensitivity which enabled him to give widely known improvisatory musical performances; he was also genial, deeply sympathetic, and capable of great affection for young and old alike&#151;hence his efforts on behalf of those deprived of the powers of speech and hearing. From 1953 he was president of the British Deaf and Dumb Association. Esteemed as a lecturer and research worker, Paget was an active member of several learned societies: fellow of the Institute of Physics, the Physical Society, and the Royal Anthropological Institute, honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, honorary associate member of the Town Planning Institute, and member and sometime manager of the Royal Institution.<br>
<br>Paget married, on 31 May 1897, Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon Finch-Hatton (1876&#150;1938) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35357/', "Paget, Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon")</script>], only daughter of the twelfth earl of Winchilsea; they had two sons (one of whom died in infancy) and three daughters. His second wife, whom he married on 22 July 1939, was Grace Hartley Glover, only daughter of Walter Herbert Glover, of Birkdale and Grasmere. Paget died at his home, 9 Alexandra Court, Queen's Gate, London, on 23 October 1955. He was survived by his second wife and four children.<br>
<br>Paget's youngest child and only surviving son, <a name="cosubject_51271"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Starr Paget</span>, third baronet  (1914&#150;1992), <span class="occ">aeronautical engineer and company director</span>, was born on 24 November 1914 in Somerset, and in the absence of his eccentric parents was brought up largely by his nanny, Nurse Evans. As a boy he contracted jaundice, so his schooling at Oundle was curtailed and he was sent to Ch&acirc;teau d'Oex in the Swiss Alps. He read engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge, and gained firsts in all parts of the tripos (BA 1936, MA 1939). In 1936 he began a graduate apprenticeship with the English Electric Co. Ltd at Stafford, later working for them at Preston and contributing innovative ideas to aircraft manufacture. In 1943 he moved to D. Napier &amp; Son, Liverpool, where he worked on the Sabre aero-engine (used in the Hawker Typhoon and the Tempest fighter). On 11 November 1944 he married Nancy Mary, elder daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Woodbine Parish, army officer, and a great-granddaughter of W. E. Gladstone; they had two sons and five daughters. Paget then moved to Napier's London works, first as manager (1946) and later as director and general manager. From 1949 he was connected with Acton Technical College (later Brunel University), where he promoted the sandwich course. After retiring from Napier in 1962 he moved to Taunton, Somerset, and became a successful bespoke cabinet-maker and cider-apple grower. He founded Somerset Fruit Machinery, which manufactured fruit-picking machines that he had designed (these were also used in Japan to pick up golf balls). Paget died on 7 February 1992 at his home, Haygrass House, Taunton, survived by his wife and seven children.<br>
