<span class="headword">Pettie,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1548&#150;1589), <span class="occ">writer of romances</span>, was the fourth son of John Pettie (or Le Petite or Petty) of Tetsworth and Stoke Talmage, Oxfordshire, and Mary, daughter of William Charnell of Snareston, Leicestershire. He became a scholar of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1564 and graduated BA on 29 March 1569. He was uncle of Mary Pettie, the mother of Anthony Wood, and it is Wood who records that during his time at Oxford Pettie formed a literary friendship with the Latin dramatist William Gager, also of Christ Church. Upon leaving Oxford, Pettie travelled in continental Europe and saw military service abroad.<br>
<br>Pettie's best-known work is a story collection entitled <span class="italic">A Petite Pallace of Pettie his Pleasure: contaynyng many pretie hystories by him set foorth in comely colours, and most delightfully discoursed</span>, which acknowledges the book's debt to <span class="italic">The Palace of Pleasure</span> (1566 and 1567) of William Painter. The <span class="italic">Petite Pallace</span> was licensed to Richard Watkins on 6 August 1576 but was published undated. Its dedication, &#145;To the gentle Gentlewomen Readers&#146;, is signed &#145;R. B.&#146; Hazlitt, in his edition of Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">History of English Poetry</span>  (1871, 4.336), proposes that these are the reversed initials of Barnaby Riche but Hartman favours the unknown &#145;R. B.&#146; who wrote <span class="italic">A New Tragicall Comedie of Apius and Virginia</span> (1575). The possibility remains that &#145;R. B.&#146; is an authorial alias used by Pettie; the prefatory matter to George Gascoigne's <span class="italic">Adventures of Master F. J.</span> (1573) employs a similar strategy, if such this is. &#145;R. B.&#146; confesses to supplying the stories without the author's permission, a scenario supported by the letter of the printer to the reader. The preliminary matter also includes &#145;The letter of G[eorge] P[ettie] to R. B. concerning this woorke&#146;, dated from Holborn, 12 July, which urges R. B. to keep the stories &#145;to your owne private pleasure&#146; because they &#145;touch neerely divers of my nere friendes&#146;.<br>
<br>Subsequent editions were published <i>c</i>.1578 and <i>c</i>.1585, the latter omitting the prefatory material, as does the edition of <i>c</i>.1590. Editions by George Eld appeared in 1608 and 1613. Modern editions have been undertaken by Israel Gollancz (1908) and Herbert Hartman (1938). The significance of the <span class="italic">Petite Pallace</span> lies in its prioritizing of a female readership, and its role in the development of the literary style called euphuism: it influenced the early euphuistic romances of Robert Greene and acted as a storehouse of proverbs for John Lyly in the writing of his romance <span class="italic">Euphues</span>. Pettie himself was not averse to literary borrowing: the influence of George Gascoigne and George Turberville can be detected in his work. The overwhelmingly Ovidian and euphuistic character of the collection is remarked in <span class="italic">Le prince d'amour</span> (1660), in which one of the offences against the prince is described as being to &#145;deprave the books of <span class="italic">Ovid de Arte amandi</span>, <span class="italic">Euphues</span> and his <span class="italic">England</span>, <span class="italic">Petite Pallace</span>, or other laudable discourses of love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Le Prince</span>, 57).<br>
<br>Pettie also translated the first three books of Guazzo's <span class="italic">Civile Conversation</span>, using the French of George Chappuys. The translation was licensed to Richard Watkins on 11 November 1579, with another mention in the Stationers' register on 27 February 1581. It was published later that year with a dedication addressed from Pettie's lodging near St Paul's, London, to Marjorie, wife of Henry Norris, Baron Norris of Rycote. In his preface to the <span class="italic">Civile Conversation</span> Pettie explains that he intends this translation to counterbalance the frivolity of the <span class="italic">Petite Pallace</span>: he hopes &#145;to purchase to my selfe some better fame by some better woorke, and to countervayle my former Vanitie, with some formal gravitie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Civile Conversation</span>, 1.7). A second issue, by Thomas East, was dated 1586, and included Guazzo's fourth book, translated from the Italian by Bartholomew Young.<br>
<br>According to Wood, Pettie died in July 1589 at Plymouth, &#145;being then a captain and a man of note&#146;, and was buried in the &#145;great church&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.555) there. He left to his brother Christopher the lands at Aston-Rowant, Kingston, and Tetsworth, Oxfordshire, which he had himself received from his father. Wood is in two minds about the literary merits of Pettie's <span class="italic">Petite Pallace</span>: his relative's &#145;passionate penning of amorous stories&#146; made him &#145;as much commended for his neat stile as any of his time&#146;, but in Wood's own time the <span class="italic">Petite Pallace</span> seemed &#145;more fit to be read by a schoolboy, or rustical amoratto, than by a gent. of mode or language&#146;  (ibid., 1.553).<br>
