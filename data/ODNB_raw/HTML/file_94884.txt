<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jenkins,  (John) Robin</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 11 September 1912 at Burnside Terrace, Flemington, near Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, the son of James Jenkins, spirit salesman, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robin. His father died in 1919, after serving in the trenches during the First World War; his early death, which Jenkins attributed to the war, meant his mother had to work in domestic service to maintain her children. He was educated (on a bursary) at Hamilton Academy and then at Glasgow University, where he graduated MA in English in 1936, going on to become a teacher in Glasgow in 1937. On 30 June the same year he married Mary McIntyre (May) Wylie (1915&#150;1988), hospital nurse, and daughter of John Wylie, shipyard worker. They had two daughters, Helen and Ann, and a son, Colin.<br>
<br>Pacifism, brought about by powerful memories of his father's death, led Jenkins to become a conscientious objector in the Second World War, and he worked for six years for the Forestry Commission in Argyll. After the war he taught abroad, in Afghanistan (at the Ghazi School, Kabul, 1957&#150;9), Spain (at the British Institute, Barcelona, 1959&#150;61), and Malaysia (at Gaya College, Sabah, 1961&#150;5), before returning to teach at Dunoon grammar school. He left teaching to take up a full-time career as a writer in 1970, producing a prodigious number of novels, not all of which were published before his death.<br>
<br>Jenkins's impressive body of work drew heavily on the distinctive and colourful elements of his personal experience. A clutch of early novels focused on childhood and poverty, clearly determined by his position as a scholarship boy (as in <span class="italic">Happy for the Child</span>, 1953), and his life as a teacher in Glasgow; he returned to such themes throughout his career, as in the striking <span class="italic">Just Duffy</span> (1985). <span class="italic">The Cone-Gatherers</span> (1955), one of his most successful novels in its wider public recognition and his personal favourite, used conscientious objectors in a forest setting as its subject; <span class="italic">A Would-be Saint</span> (1978) and <span class="italic">The Pearl-fishers</span> (published posthumously in 2007) also drew on Jenkins's Forestry Commission experience. A number of mid-career novels depicted situations made familiar to him by his teaching experience overseas; again he was interested in cultural conflicts and the misunderstandings they produce, through ethnicity as well as class. <span class="italic">Dust on the Paw</span> (1961) was one of his best and most ambitious works from this period but he also returned to these settings in later years in <span class="italic">Leila</span> (1995). The focus of all his novels, however, remained the same: the difficulty of goodness, both in the sense of being good, and the complicated responses that apparent goodness in an individual produces in others. Childhood, and the dynamic between innocence and experience, were consistently a basis for these explorations, from the early novel <span class="italic">The Changeling</span> (1958) to <span class="italic">Matthew and Sheila</span> (1998), although some later novels also explored the idiosyncrasies of old age (for instance <span class="italic">Willie Hogg</span>, 1993, and <span class="italic">Childish Things</span>, 2001). The particular implications of goodness, perceived or real, in a Scottish context were addressed through contemporary settings in <span class="italic">A Very Scotch Affair</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Fergus Lamont</span> (1979), and with a historical backdrop in <span class="italic">The Awakening of George Darroch</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">Lady Magdalen</span> (2003). He also made forays into the short story with <span class="italic">A Far Cry from Bowmore</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Lunderston Tales</span> (1996).<br>
<br>While Jenkins eschewed the vernacular and the visceral espoused by younger Scottish writers, his moral realism, the desire to confront the uncomfortable and unspeakable, can be seen recurring in such novelists as Iain Banks and A. L. Kennedy, whose subject matter might initially appear very different from his own. Jenkins himself cited Evelyn Waugh as an influence, and praised Robert Louis Stevenson's south sea fiction, but his interest in characters who represent fantastic or grotesque personalities might also be linked with earlier writers like James Hogg and Sir Walter Scott. Although he was described as &#145;the Scottish Thomas Hardy&#146; because of the bleakness of his perspective, and while some of his novels might be aligned with Scottish working-class fiction of the 1950s, Jenkins saw himself as a blackly comic moralist, &#145;a mixture of dour Presbyterian realism and another part of me which says to hell with all that&#146;  (Norquay, &#145;Moral absolutism&#146;, 439), returning to the same concern with goodness and hypocrisy in all his novels.<br>
<br>Scottish literary critics frequently argued that Jenkins never fully achieved the commercial success his novels deserved. He may have failed to attract a wider readership and critical acclaim because his novels initially appeared to offer social realism but were concerned with much wider metaphysical explorations: they were uncomfortable to experience but profound in impact. As a writer he saw himself as very much working on his own. Although he attributed critical neglect to his time living in (and writing about) foreign parts, in later years he gained recognition for his contribution to Scottish literature, being appointed OBE in 1999 and receiving the Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun award in 2001, for services to Scottish life and culture. In 2003 he was given a Saltire Society lifetime achievement award. He died on 24 February 2005 at Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock, following a stroke. He was survived by his daughters, Helen and Ann; his wife, May, and his son, Colin, predeceased him.<br>
