<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Larcom, Sir  Thomas Aiskew</span>, first baronet  (1801&#150;1879), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, the son of Captain Joseph Larcom, RN (<i>d</i>. 1818), and Ann, daughter of William Hollis of Liverstoke, was born at Gosport, Hampshire, on 22 April 1801. He had an elder brother and three sisters. After studying at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich he was in 1820 commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. In 1824 he was chosen by Thomas Colby to work on the Ordnance Survey, originally in England and Wales and, after 1826, in Ireland. From 1826 to 1828 he worked with Joseph Portlock on the great triangulation by which the Irish survey was connected with that of England. In 1828 Colby appointed Larcom as his assistant in the headquarters of the Irish survey in Mountjoy, Phoenix Park, near Dublin, where he took charge of the practical side of the work and proved an exacting but popular and inspiring taskmaster. He organized the many civilians and soldiers needed to compile, engrave, and publish the remarkable 6 inch maps of Ireland. He organized the adoption after considerable controversy of the electrotype process, which allowed maps to be updated more readily, and the introduction of contour lines to replace hachuring. Mountjoy under Larcom became a centre of scientific education and was visited by numerous individuals, institutions, and businesses who were supplied with information gathered by surveyors, even before the maps for which it was compiled were published. Larcom believed that the work of the survey should be expanded to include a detailed descriptive memoir of each locality. The Irish administration approved the scheme, but, after the publication in 1837 of the memoir of Templemore in Londonderry, refused on grounds of economy to authorize further memoirs. This was perhaps not surprising given that the memoir contained such information as the diameter of every mill wheel in the townland and the amount spent on manure down to the nearest penny. Larcom himself, however, continued to study the Irish language and, with the help of agents, accumulated an unrivalled store of information about the history, languages, and antiquities of Ireland, much of which might otherwise have been lost. He also established the meteorological observatory in Phoenix Park, intending it as part of a nationwide network of weather stations.<br>
<br>With his systematic approach and realization of the value of maps, Larcom prompted many improvements in the gathering and presentation of official information. He prepared the maps needed to effect the changes caused by the <span class="roman">Irish Reform Bill</span> and in 1836 compiled a remarkable map of the country to show proposed railway building and prepared the topographical part of the <span class="italic">Report on Irish Municipal Reform</span>, completing elaborate maps of sixty-seven towns in one month. In 1840 Larcom married Georgina (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of General Sir George D'Aguilar, with whom he had four sons and a daughter. In 1841 he became a census commissioner and at his instigation the Irish census of that year included a classification of the occupations and general condition of the population, as well as its numbers; a permanent branch of the registrar-general's department was formed for the collection of agricultural statistics, and thematic maps accompanied the census reports. The pattern set by the Irish census was later adopted in England. In 1842 he was appointed commissioner for inquiring into the state of the Royal Irish Society and again in 1845 in connection with the Queen's colleges.<br>
<br>Although always theoretically subordinate to Colby, it was Larcom who moulded the Irish survey to a model of a national survey board, initiating projects and supplying information of the highest standard to enquirers. His personal dedication to the survey's work was reflected in the use of the term &#145;Larcom's survey&#146; for the 6 inch maps of the 1830s. Information gathered by the survey was used by Larcom during the 1846 famine when he helped to organize road building and drainage as public relief works for the destitute. By this time the 6 inch survey was nearing completion and, as part of a plan to bring the Irish survey under the control of the Southampton Ordnance Survey headquarters, Larcom was removed from his post on 4 May 1848 leaving him with only a temporary appointment with the famine relief commission to mark more than twenty years of service.<br>
<br>Larcom's plight attracted attention, but was overshadowed by the general problems in the country. He occupied himself preparing an edition of the seventeenth-century &#145;down survey&#146; of William Petty (1851) and held temporary positions with poor relief and boundary reform commissions before, in 1853, he was appointed under-secretary for Ireland, an office which for the first time was non-political and permanent. Under him the administration became conspicuously more efficient and stable, although not daringly innovative. Its most important legacy was the valuations from Richard Griffith's cadastral survey of the country in the 1850s and 1860s, using which local taxation was reformed and other changes made. Notable reforms were made to the poor law, medical dispensaries, sewerage, and local government. Larcom, adopting the policy of his friend Thomas Drummond who had also become under-secretary after service on the survey, aimed to govern all parties disinterestedly, to remove abuses, and to prevent disorder by systematic vigilance through fostering a belief in the ubiquity of the government's power. He was promoted major-general in 1858 and created KCB in 1860. His unique knowledge of the country enabled him to use his position to encourage economic growth, in particular capital investment and schemes to help the poor. He also encouraged education, particularly the Queen's colleges for the upper classes, despite Roman Catholic opposition, and hoped to lessen religious discord by encouraging the teaching of aspects of religion which all denominations had in common. He saw a steady increase in prosperity during his term of office. Each year he drew up memoranda to be read by the lord lieutenant, showing by official returns the progress of agriculture, improvements in standards of living, and reductions in crime. They also showed his belief that copious and accurate information was the basis for good science and good government.<br>
<br>The final years of Larcom's administration were marked by the Fenian uprising, which he helped quell, leaving Ireland peaceful on his retirement in 1868. He was created a baronet on 24 December 1868 and was also sworn of the privy council in Ireland that year. He spent his retirement collecting information about Ireland during his term of office, which he arranged in volumes and presented to the learned societies, chiefly Irish, with which he had been associated. He died at Heathfield, near Fareham, on 15 June 1879. In appearance Larcom was of middle height and thickly set, with an imposing head. He is justly remembered for his significant contribution to the Irish survey and for establishing the need for good-quality information on which to base government administration.<br>
