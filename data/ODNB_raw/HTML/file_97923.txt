<span class="headword">Martin,  Lionel Walker Birch</span>  (1878&#150;1945), <span class="occ">motor vehicle dealer and manufacturer</span>, was born at Nansladron, St Ewe, Cornwall, on 15 March 1878, the son of Edward Martin (<i>b</i>. 1843) and his wife, Elizabeth Emily, formerly Braithwaite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Birch (<i>b</i>. 1850). His father was a proprietor of Martin Brothers China Clay Merchants in nearby St Austell. The family also owned the Lee Moor porcelain factory in Plympton, Devon. His mother came from Salford where her family were prosperous chalk and lime merchants. Singleton Birch &amp; Sons Ltd was founded by her father, William Singleton Birch, with her brothers, William and Thomas, as his business partners. Emily was briefly married to Walter Braithwaite of Salford but was a young widow by the time she married Edward Martin in 1877. Their alliance brought together two powerful mining interests and the Martins maintained a comfortable lifestyle in London while their son was growing up.<br>
<br>In 1891 Martin was sent to Eton College where he became a keen cyclist. He claimed that he was given his first bicycle as a reward for helping his mother learn how to ride. In 1897 he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, and was a leading member of the Oxford University Bicycle Club before joining the exclusive Bath Road Club (BRC). Known for his dedication to training and successful in breaking a number of cycling records, he was also an enthusiastic participant in the club's social activities and acquired a reputation for practical joking. In 1900 he migrated to Marcon's Hall, a private establishment connected with Oxford University run by an Anglican clergyman, Charles Marcon. There he took the examinations to qualify for a pass degree, and graduated BA in 1902. He marked his transition from undergraduate to gentleman by shaving off his long moustache.<br>
<br>Through the BRC Martin met Montague Napier whose family ran an engineering firm which had just begun to expand into a new technology, the motor vehicle. Martin's interest was also turning in this direction and in 1903 the friends went into partnership to sell De Dion Bouton and Napier cars. In 1909 he married the 21-year-old Christine Murray of Auchendinny, Midlothian. The same year his motoring activities received a setback. After being fined in Richmond for driving at excessive speed, he refused to answer a summons for a similar offence in Guildford. As a consequence he was banned from driving for two years. His appeal, which concerned evidence of his previous speeding convictions, was dismissed in the High Court in January 1910. He filled the gap by racing tricycles, gaining several more records including the fastest journey from Edinburgh to York in 1911. By the time Martin's driving ban was lifted, he had become friends with a new BRC member, the engineer Robert Bamford. During 1912 they joined together to trade small cars from premises in Callow Street, Chelsea.<br>
<br>1913 was a year of contrasting fortunes for Martin. Christine Martin died in April shortly after the birth of their son, John. In January, however, Bamford and Martin Ltd had been incorporated and moved to Henniker Mews in Kensington. The firm became an agency for Singer cars which they began to adapt for competition. In the spring and summer of 1914 Martin drove a Singer in the Motor Cycling Club's London to Edinburgh trial and won a two lap cyclecar race in the Oxford and Cambridge universities fixture at Brooklands. In the early years of the motor industry this was a common and enjoyable way of gaining publicity. The goal was, however, to build and sell their own car, designed for rich young men who were more interested in performance than price. Their cycling friends were typical of the potential market and in 1914 Martin placed an advert in the <span class="italic">Bath Road News</span>: &#145;If you must sell your birthright for a mess of petrol, why not purchase your car, cycle car or motor bicycle from Bamford &amp; Martin Ltd, the most humorous firm in the motor trade&#146;.<br>
<br>A prototype was built and registered in March 1915. Searching for an evocative name Bamford and Martin combined reference to their sporting success at Aston Hill with Martin's name to create &#145;the Aston-Martin car&#146;. Their efforts were temporarily frustrated by the First World War. Bamford joined the Army Service Corps and Martin worked for the Admiralty at Chepstow shipyards which were turned over to wartime contracts.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1917 Martin married Katherine King (1888&#150;1958), the divorced wife of Robert Henry King, a naval lieutenant, and the daughter of Harvey George Alexander, an Anglican clergyman in Barnstaple, Devon. Katherine Martin was known for her forthright character and took an active interest in her husband's business. She enjoyed driving and designed the AM radiator badge which went onto the early cars.<br>
<br>In 1915 Martin became a director of Singleton Birch though he had no active role. His uncle Thomas Birch was now in charge and intended Martin to inherit his majority shareholding. The war heightened demand for minerals and the resulting prosperity of Singleton Birch provided Martin with funds to invest into his motoring business once peace returned. Bamford and Martin moved to Abingdon Road in Kensington but was a long way from producing anything suitable for sale in the competitive post-war market. Bamford became tired of the slow progress so Martin bought him out and Katherine Martin took his place as a director.<br>
<br>A series of prototypes went through the workshops. Finally, in 1921, an Aston Martin was ready to go into production with a high-end price of &pound;850. By then the company was struggling to stay afloat. In 1922 his friend the racing driver Count Louis Zborowski contributed &pound;10,000 to build two cars for the Isle of Man tourist trophy but they were not ready in time. Instead, the cars were entered in the 1922 French grand prix with poor results. In July 1924 another wealthy friend and old Etonian, John Benson, joined the Martins on the board after his mother, Lady Charnwood, made a considerable investment in the company. Nevertheless Bamford and Martin failed in November 1925 and the receiver, Arthur Whale, dismissed Martin from his directorship. When Benson publicly criticized him for the way he had run the business, Martin sued him for slander. The court proceedings in October 1926 revealed that Martin had lost &pound;31,000 of his own money. Though he won his case he was awarded a mere 1&frac34;<i>d</i>. in damages.<br>
<br>The firm's assets were finally bought by Renwick and Bertelli who set up Aston Martin Motors Ltd, the first time the name would be applied to the business and not just the car. Martin turned back to Singleton Birch and in 1929 became its majority shareholder. He continued to buy and compete in motor cars but never owned an Aston Martin after 1925. The Second World War and the restrictions brought about by petrol rationing inspired him to return to cycling with fateful consequences. He was knocked off his tricycle when a car hit him at traffic lights near his home, Palings, Warboys Road, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. A week later, on 21 October 1945, he died in Kingston Hospital. After a funeral at St John's Church, Kingston Vale, he was buried at Putney Vale cemetery.<br>
<br>Martin's social background differentiated him from other motor industry pioneers such as the engineer Herbert Austin or the businessman William Morris. It was perhaps this which gave the car from its earliest days a reputation far exceeding either its scale of production or its profitability. Aston Martin as a company would tread a rocky road over the years but the marque itself has always remained the stuff of aspirational dreams, epitomized by its long association with the glamour of the James Bond movies.<br>
