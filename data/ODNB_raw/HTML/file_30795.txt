<span class="headword">Bartlett,  (Charles) Vernon Oldfeld</span>  (1894&#150;1983), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 30 April 1894 at Westbury, Wiltshire, the second of the three children and only son of Thomas Oldfeld Bartlett, bank manager, of Swanage, and his wife, Beatrice Mary Jecks. He was educated at Blundell's School at Tiverton but psoriasis forced him to leave early. He was sent to live abroad and acquired a fluent mastery of the main European languages that later stood him in good stead as a foreign correspondent.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Bartlett was in hospital recovering from a wound when his regiment (the Dorset) suffered an early poison gas attack. Later in 1915 he was the only man pulled out alive when his dugout received a direct hit. He was invalided out of the army with a burning conviction that further world wars must be prevented. He found work in Fleet Street, joining the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> as a general reporter. In 1917 he married Marguerite Eleonore (<i>d</i>. 1966), the Belgian refugee daughter of Henri van Bemden, a well-to-do food merchant of Antwerp. They had two sons, the younger of whom died in 1970.<br>
<br>Also in 1917 Bartlett joined Reuters which later sent him to cover the Paris peace conference, and in 1919 he became a foreign correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, reporting the turbulent post-war diplomatic developments from Geneva, Berlin, Rome, and Warsaw. With his international experience and his repugnance of war it was a natural step for him to become, in 1922, the director of the London office of the League of Nations, a post he held until 1932.<br>
<br>Bartlett was an early broadcaster, at first occasionally about the work of the league, and later analysing general international developments in a weekly series, <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>. He became an outstanding communicator to whom a rising generation owed its interest in foreign affairs. The BBC <span class="italic">Yearbook</span> for 1931 noted: &#145;By his unobtrusive charm and his respect for truth and a certain quality of fair play which is inherent in his work, Mr Bartlett has made of international affairs a subject of general interest&#146;.<br>
<br>That quality of fair play sometimes got Bartlett into trouble. In October 1933 Nazi Germany walked out of the disarmament conference at Geneva and left the League of Nations. Bartlett was far from pro-Nazi, but broadcasting on the BBC, which had employed him full time since October 1932, he made the immediate comment: &#145;I believe the British would have acted in much the same way as Germany has acted if they had been in the same position.&#146;<br>
<br>This remark provoked an immediate political storm. There were violent protests from the prime minister, J. Ramsay MacDonald, and other MPs, as well as in the press. Bartlett himself said he received thousands of letters, the overwhelming majority in support. The BBC told him it would be easier for him to continue broadcasting if he were not on the staff, adding that the politics of any newspaper he joined might affect the frequency of his broadcast invitations. Bartlett therefore resigned, rejecting a lucrative offer from the Labour <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> in favour of a smaller one from the more moderate <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. Yet, by what he regarded as cowardly treatment, it was several years before he was asked to broadcast again.<br>
<br>For the next two decades Bartlett travelled widely as the <span class="italic">News Chronicle's</span> diplomatic correspondent. In 1938, after Chamberlain at Munich yielded to Hitler's demands over Czechoslovakia, he stood as an Independent Progressive candidate opposed to the appeasement policy in the by-election at Bridgwater, then a safe Conservative seat. With no party machine to support him, though he had a number of keen volunteers, he won Bridgwater, and held it until 1950. He contributed usefully to debates on foreign affairs, but the role of an independent member was perhaps too lonely for one so gregarious by nature.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Bartlett's broadcasting skill was put to good use. He spoke three times a week to America and often in French and German. His <span class="italic">Postscripts</span>, after the 9 o'clock home news, were wise, compassionate talks, often including touches of sardonic humour, and they did much to sustain domestic morale. For a time he served as British press attach&eacute; in Moscow. At one Kremlin dinner, emboldened by vodka, he responded to a toast to the press by declaring that without a free press there could not be a free people. Stalin commented: &#145;That young man talks too much.&#146;<br>
<br>After retiring from the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> in 1954 Bartlett worked as a journalist in Singapore and in 1956 he was appointed CBE. In 1961 he moved to a farm in Tuscany where he produced wine and continued to write books&#151;twenty-eight altogether. His first had been an autobiographical novel (1929) about calf love in pre-war Berlin. Others were about foreign affairs and his travels in south-east Asia, Africa, and Europe, and especially about his beloved Tuscany. An autobiography, written when he was forty-three, provides revealing insights into European diplomacy between the wars.<br>
<br>Bartlett's wife died in 1966 but three years later he made a happy second marriage, to Eleanor Needham (Jo), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Theodore Francis Ritchie DSO, Royal Army Medical Corps, and widow of Walter Menzel, of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Bartlett died at Yeovil, Somerset, on 18 January 1983.<br>
