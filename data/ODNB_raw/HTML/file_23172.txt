<span class="headword">Ravenscroft,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1591/2), <span class="occ">music theorist and composer</span>, was quite probably one of the Flintshire Ravenscrofts: on a flyleaf of the copy of <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse</span> (1614) that he presented to Sir John Egerton, whose mother was Elizabeth Ravenscroft of Bretton, the author described himself as &#145;the meanest of a name soe much honored by you&#146;. The Hawarden parish register does not support the claim, made by Venn  (3.424) and others, that Thomas was baptized on 13 June 1592, the son of Roger Ravenscroft, canon of Chester.<br>
<br>By 1598 Ravenscroft was a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral under Thomas Giles, and he was still there in 1600 when Edward Pearce became organist and master of the choristers. Ravenscroft was involved in the activities of the St Paul's company of child actors, which, like the children of the Chapel Royal, catered for more sophisticated audiences by including in their plays specially written songs performed by trained voices and instrumentalists. According to a marginal note in his <span class="italic">Briefe Discourse</span>, he graduated MusB from Cambridge at the age of fourteen: since a poem in this source gives his age at that point as twenty-two, it is likely he was the Thomas Rangcrofte of Pembroke College who so graduated on 21 June 1605. He was also a student at Gresham College, to whose &#145;most worthy and Grave Senators&#146; he dedicated <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse</span>.<br>
<br>In 1609 Ravenscroft published the first edition of <span class="italic">Pammelia</span>, the earliest English printed collection of rounds and catches, &#145;Art having reformed what pleasing tunes injurious time and ignorance had deformed&#146;  (&#145;To the reader&#146;, <span class="italic">Pammelia</span>). Its 100 examples comprise settings of sacred texts, tavern songs, vendors' cries, sol-faing pieces, traditional ballads, and songs from the contemporary theatre. The contents of <span class="italic">Deuteromelia</span> (also 1609) were similarly &#145;made truely Musicall with Art by my <i>correction</i>&#146;, the aim being not only to entertain but to preserve, for &#145;pittie were it, such Mirth should be <i>forgotten</i> of us&#146;  (&#145;To the reader&#146;, <span class="italic">Deuteromelia</span>). Among its fourteen &#145;Freemen's Songs&#146; and seventeen catches are &#145;Hold thy peace, knave&#146;, sung in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, and &#145;Three blind mice&#146;. <span class="italic">Melismata</span> (1611), dedicated to his kinsmen Thomas and William Ravenscroft, contains twenty-three settings of which nine are &#145;Citie&#146; and &#145;Country&#146; rounds; appropriate dramatic contexts have been suggested for a number of its songs.<br>
<br>Whereas the music of these collections is anonymous, of the songs appended to Ravenscroft's treatise <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse</span> to illustrate his theoretical ideas, twelve are attributed to him, six others are by John Bennet, and two are by Edward Pearce. The work itself laments the contemporary abuse of mensuration signs, and advocates a return to medieval practice. The music includes play songs, madrigalian pieces, and a jig-like series of pieces in which Hodge Trillinde woos Malkyn in a broad west-country dialect. Ravenscroft may have maintained his youthful links with the theatre, for early in 1618 he witnessed the will of the actor Richard Cowley. From January 1618 to November 1622 he was music master at Christ's Hospital, where he was paid &pound;10 annually &#145;to teach the children of this house pricksong&#146;.<br>
<br>Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Whole Booke of Psalmes</span> (1621), to which he contributed fifty-five of its 105 settings, is one of the most important psalters of the period, though it contains much music from earlier publications. A number of his vocal and instrumental compositions, as well as a &#145;Treatise of musick&#146;, survive in manuscript. His part-writing often lacks fluency, and his powers of melodic and harmonic invention rarely achieve a consistently high level of inspiration. The date of Ravenscroft's death is unknown and no will has been traced. Presumably he was still alive in 1633 when the second edition of his psalter appeared.<br>
