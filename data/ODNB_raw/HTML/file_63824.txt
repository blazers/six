<span class="headword">Ball,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1911&#150;1913), <span class="occ">suffrage activist and trade unionist</span>, came from a working-class family, possibly based in the midlands. Little is known of his early years apart from his paid work after leaving school. After working initially as a gardener, he became a master tailor with his own business, moving into unskilled work when this failed. In 1911&#150;12 he was living in Birmingham with his wife and five children and was a member of the Transport Workers' Federation.<br>
<br>Ball came to public attention in 1912 as a result of involvement in the Men's Political Union (MPU), one of several men's groups campaigning for women's suffrage. As a working-class man, he was an anomaly in an organization whose members were predominantly from middle-class educated backgrounds. Ball was arrested in December 1911 after breaking Home Office windows in protest against the prison treatment of a fellow MPU member. On 22 December 1911 he was sentenced to two months' hard labour. Once in prison he went on hunger strike and refused to wear prison clothes. As a result he was forcibly fed twice a day for five weeks. By 25 January 1912 prison authorities recorded that he was &#145;restless and talking wildly&#146; but was taking food voluntarily four days later  (Holton, &#145;Manliness and militancy&#146;, 126). However, on 9 February 1912 he was declared insane and was released as a pauper into the care of a lunatic asylum, on the grounds that he had no family or friends to receive him. Ball's wife had been informed of his release only after the event, and was able to move him into private care only after some argument.<br>
<br>The issue of Ball's prison treatment and release into a lunatic asylum was taken up by members of the MPU, in particular by Hugh Franklin, who protested to his uncle Herbert Samuel, a member of the Liberal government. The MPU was concerned not only that Ball had been released before the end of his sentence, but also that he had been sent to an asylum without his family being informed. The haste and apparent secrecy surrounding this action, together with grave concerns about his health, raised questions about the mistreatment of Ball in prison and about the possible attempt to cover this up. A doctor examining William Ball after his release from prison found high levels of sugar in his urine and an ulcer on his throat, yet there was no reference to either condition in his prison notes, nor was any date given for the onset of the mental illness which was supposedly the reason for releasing him in the first place.<br>
<br>Bowing to pressure, the Home Office launched an inquiry into Ball's prison treatment, headed by Sir George Savage. The resulting white paper vindicated the prison authorities, maintaining that Ball was a man of &#145;feeble intellect&#146;, &#145;defective&#146; in general knowledge, and &#145;illiterate&#146;. It concluded that his mental breakdown had nothing to do with his treatment as a prisoner on hunger strike, but was the outcome of &#145;living in a state of emotional excitement because of his suffrage activities, or maybe the consequence of an accident he had suffered as a dock labourer&#146;  (Holton, &#145;Manliness and militancy&#146;, 126). Prison records reported that although Ball had co-operated with forcible feeding, he had shown some evidence of sensory and auditory hallucinations, believing he had experienced electrical torture. After his release Ball maintained that he had been tied down and given electric shocks while being force-fed.<br>
<br>The MPU and others challenged the report, arguing that Ball was a literate, skilled worker who had fallen on hard times, and that the industrial injury to which the report attempted to attribute his breakdown was a strain to his knee, not to his intellect. It is notable also that Ball conducted his own defence in court when arrested; this action certainly seems at odds with the Savage report's claims about his inferior intellect.<br>
<br>Ball was back in prison a year later after involvement in another protest. Although he went on hunger strike, he was released after two days when his fine was paid anonymously. Nothing is known of his life after these events.<br>
