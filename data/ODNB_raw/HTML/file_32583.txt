<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coulton,  George Gordon</span>  (1858&#150;1947), <span class="occ">historian and controversialist</span>, was born at Tower Place, King's Lynn, Norfolk, on 15 October 1858, the third son and sixth child of John James Coulton, a solicitor of Yorkshire origins, and his wife, Sarah Radley. After early schooling at a dame-school at Lynn, the <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> at St Omer, and Lynn grammar school, he was sent to Felsted School from where, in 1877, he won a classical scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge. He remembered his Cambridge years without affection, perhaps owing to the failure of health which in 1881 confined him to an <i>aegrotat</i> degree. Briefly a master at a preparatory school in Malvern, he then trained for holy orders under Charles John Vaughan, though already subject to doubts concerning the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. Ordained deacon in 1883, he held curacies at Offley and Rickmansworth, but his misgivings grew, and in 1885 he finally decided that he could not proceed to the priesthood. Coulton then held a series of teaching posts in public schools, an experience he seems to have found increasingly depressing, since about 1896 he attempted suicide. But his life was saved, and in that year he took up a tutoring job at a coaching establishment in Eastbourne which he ran with his college friend Henry von Essen Scott for thirteen years. He had been studying the middle ages since the mid-1870s, and his new position gave him time both for extension lecturing and for the methodical study of primary sources which made him one of the most learned medievalists of his age. It also financed foreign travel&#151;it was in Switzerland that in 1903 he met Rose Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), daughter of Owen Ilbert, of Thurlestone, Devon, and niece of the parliamentary draftsman Sir Courtenay Ilbert. They married on 19 July 1904 and had two daughters.<br>
<br>During the first decade of the twentieth century Coulton began to publish and to establish his scholarly reputation, starting with a translation of Salimbene (1906; enlarged edn, 1907) and a book about Chaucer (1908). He followed these with two anthologies of medieval sources, <span class="italic">A Medieval Garner</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Social Britain from the Conquest to the Reformation</span> (1918), in which he began the process of putting original historical material before the general public which constituted one of his most notable services to scholarship. In 1911 he had moved to Cambridge, following his election as Birkbeck lecturer in ecclesiastical history at Trinity College, and supported himself by private tutoring. The fall in student numbers during the war made his position financially precarious, but in 1919 he was elected to a lecturership in the English faculty, which he held until his retirement in 1934, and a fellowship of St John's College. A secure income provided the basis for further research and writing, and in the last twenty-five years of his life Coulton published several substantial books as well as a number of shorter ones: <span class="italic">The Medieval Village</span> (1925); <span class="italic">Art and the Reformation</span> (1928); <span class="italic">Inquisition and Liberty</span> and <span class="italic">Medieval Panorama</span> (both 1938); <span class="italic">Five Centuries of Religion</span>, published in four volumes between 1923 and 1950, the last appearing posthumously. From 1940 to 1944 he was guest lecturer at the University of Toronto. He was elected fellow of the British Academy in 1929 and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Durham (1920), Edinburgh (1931), and Kingston, Ontario (1942). He died at his home, 201 Chesterton Road, Cambridge, on 4 March 1947; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>A bare account of Coulton's career and its achievements conveys no idea of its frequently embattled course. He was constantly embroiled in controversy, by no means all of it academic. Thus he was a strong supporter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95555', "National Service League")</script>, advocating compulsory national service for home defence, and campaigned energetically for it; his book <span class="italic">The Case for Compulsory Military Service</span> (1917) runs to nearly 400 pages. But he was far more often in the public eye for his recurrent conflicts with a group of Roman Catholic historians and apologists prominent in the early twentieth century, all of whom, and particularly Cardinal Francis Gasquet, he repeatedly denounced for what he described as &#145;habits of literary dishonesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Monastic Legend</span>, 1905, 12 n. 2). The sense of outrage which runs through practically all Coulton's writings had several roots. One was an absolute commitment to truth, which in a historiographical context meant a scrupulous dependence on contemporary sources, accurately cited, and furious broadsides of reproof for those who transgressed against this basic standard. Then there was a measure of religious antagonism. After deciding not to become a priest Coulton moved to a rather elusive spiritual position, somewhere between deism and Christian agnosticism, which in its acceptance of doubt left him radically opposed to the certainties of ultramontane Catholicism. Unlike his opponents, moreover, he fully accepted the claims of modernism; indeed he actively promoted them. This third strand in his historical thinking he himself described as his determination &#145;to justify the main trend of modern culture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ten Medieval Studies</span>, 3rd edn, 1930, vii), and he attacked Catholic writers like Gasquet and G. K. Chesterton because he felt that they had constructed a false image of the medieval past, as centuries in which religious devotion had bred social contentment, in order to use it as a rebuke to the present. Far from regretting his involvement in controversy, he regarded it as part of his duty as a historian.<br>
<br>The carelessness and tendentiousness of Gasquet and his followers fully merited correction, but there was a degree of na&iuml;vety about Coulton's obsession with truthfulness, unsurprising, perhaps, in a man who could denounce his six-year-old daughter as a liar for a fib about a rabbit's nest. He acknowledged that preachers and moralists might have overstated the evils of their age, but in practice usually ignored his own caveat, with the result that his claims for the realities of medieval life sometimes appear as overbalanced in one direction as those of his adversaries in another. This feeling of imbalance is accentuated by Coulton's pugnacious literary style, as great accumulations of evidence (he was said to have read the entire <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>) are deployed to overwhelm his opponents. Many of his books have dozens of appendices in which the errors of his opponents are exposed at length; <span class="italic">The Medieval Village</span> concludes with fifty-eight pages devoted entirely to &#145;A rough list of misstatements and blunders in Cardinal Gasquet's writings&#146;. Coulton's only novel, <span class="italic">Friar's Lantern</span> (1906), is a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> in which a young curate devoted to the idea of the middle ages as an age of faith is transported back to the fourteenth century, where he undergoes a series of harrowing experiences; it ends with a characteristic assurance from the author that &#145;there is scarcely an incident which I have not taken from the most unimpeachable sources&#146;  (p. 247), together with two documentary illustrations to underline the point.<br>
<br>In appearance Coulton was tall and thin, his height accentuated, in the eyes of a French journalist, by his wearing clothes that were too short and tight. In academic circles he was combative but not malicious, and often made friends with those who stood up to him in debate&#151;for instance the young Maurice Powicke. His abundant energies were not confined to scholarship, however, and sometimes made him a trial to his family. In his daughter Mary's <span class="italic">Father: a Portrait of G. G. Coulton at Home</span>, a minor masterpiece of exasperated affection, he appears as &#145;a powerful intellect and personality which steadily sustained a small middle-class household and sporadically wrecked its peace&#146;  (Campion, 140), a man addicted to cocoa brewed according to an elaborate recipe entirely his own, which he drank in a study filled with home-made gadgets, and also given to eccentricities like the embarrassing habit of removing meat-bones from plates at other people's dinner parties in order to take them home for his cats.<br>
<br>Coulton deserves to be remembered for more than his personal idiosyncrasies, however, for he made important contributions to medieval history. Not the least of them was his own extensive scholarship. He supported his arguments with a vast array of citations, more often from printed texts than from unpublished sources, but still extending far beyond the government-sponsored publications which proliferated in western Europe about the end of the nineteenth century. He appreciated the value of the medieval sermons and theological treatises which were still being printed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and also made good use of literary sources. This substructure of knowledge gives lasting value to even his most contentious writings. He also contributed to a widening of the range of medieval studies by his attention to social and economic issues. He expressed admiration for a few great men, like St Francis, St Bernard, and Archbishop Eudes Rigaud, but was principally concerned to study the effects of institutions like monasticism on the lower orders of society.<br>
<br>Coulton believed in bringing the fruits of his learning to a wider public than one made up of his fellow academics. A fine public speaker (several of his books originated in lecture courses), and always lucid and vigorous in his writings, he deliberately conceived anthologies of sources and books like <span class="italic">Medieval Panorama</span> to this end. He also encouraged other scholars to publish, and through the series <span class="roman">Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought</span>, which he inaugurated in 1920, provided the means for younger historians like Eileen Power to make their first appearances in print. Here and elsewhere, Coulton's obsession with factual accuracy helped to raise standards of scholarship. It is at least partly owing to him that twenty-first-century historians who present a view of medieval society more favourable than any he would have countenanced himself do so from a basis of scholarship unknown to his adversaries. Coulton's passionate concern for truth had some curious side-effects, but overall it served him and his profession well.<br>
