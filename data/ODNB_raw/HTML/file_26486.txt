<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, first earl of Atholl  (1440?&#150;1512), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of Sir James Stewart of Lorne and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14646/', "Joan, n&#233;e Beaufort (d. 1445)")</script>, widow of James I. His parents had married in July 1439, and John may well have been born in the following year. He is first recorded in an English safe conduct obtained by his father on 22 November 1445. John, his father, and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54326/', "James Stewart (the future earl of Buchan)")</script> appeared on similar safe conducts issued in November 1447 and August 1451. His father having been killed at sea by Flemish pirates some time after August 1451, John evidently returned to Scotland, and by 20 June 1457 he had been created earl of Atholl by his royal half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14588/', "James II")</script>.<br>
<br>On 25 March 1460 Atholl received a grant of the lordship and castle of Balvenie from James II. The occasion of the grant seems to have been John's marriage to Margaret Douglas, daughter of Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas. Balvenie had been forfeited to the crown in 1455 because of the rebellion of John Douglas, lord of Balvenie, the younger brother of Margaret's first and second husbands, the eighth and ninth earls of Douglas. Margaret had followed her second husband into political exile in England during 1455, but returned to Scotland <i>c</i>.1459, after which their marriage was dissolved.<br>
<br>Atholl continued to enjoy a good relationship with the royal house following the accession of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III")</script> to the throne in August 1460. Thus he played an active and important role in campaigns against John, earl of Ross and lord of the Isles, following Ross's forfeiture on 1 December 1475. On 4 December 1475 Atholl was made royal lieutenant in the bounds of Atholl itself, with the leading of the king's lieges in Appin of Dull, Strathbraan, Fortingall, Rannoch, Glenlyon, and Strathardle, as part of the general assault against John of the Isles. On 3 March 1481 Atholl was given a grant of the forest of Cluny and the park of Laighwood as a reward for his role in subduing the rebellion of John of the Isles.<br>
<br>The relationship between Atholl and his nephew did not remain cordial, however. James III managed to alienate many of his subjects through the imprisonment of his own brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26453/', "Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26484/', "John Stewart, earl of Mar")</script>, in 1478&#150;9, and his active promotion of an unpopular pro-English foreign policy. Political discontent was exacerbated by an economic crisis, and by 1482 the king met growing hostility. By the summer of that year the Scottish realm faced an English invasion nominally in support of the claims of James III's charismatic brother Albany (who had escaped from James's custody in 1479 and fled into exile) to replace James as king of Scots. On 22 July 1482, while the royal army was assembling at Lauder in order to resist the imminent English invasion, James III was arrested by Atholl and his brother James Stewart, now earl of Buchan, and they then imprisoned the king in Edinburgh Castle. The prominence of Atholl and Buchan almost certainly reflected their quasi-royal status as the closest male relatives of the king still resident in Scotland, which allowed them to act as a legitimizing focus for resistance to James. But the unity of the rebel lords seems to have broken down very swiftly after James's incarceration in Edinburgh, and over the winter of 1482&#150;3 the king slowly recovered his hold on power. In January 1483 Buchan became involved in a new plot against the king in alliance with Albany and Edward IV of England, but Atholl did not participate in this second plot, and avoided the sentence of banishment imposed on his brother by James III in March 1483.<br>
<br>In 1488 Atholl remained loyal to James III when the king faced a new rebellion, this time headed by the heir to the throne, Prince James (the future James IV). He was entrusted with part of the royal hoard during the campaigns of 1488 and was a member of the royal host defeated at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488.<br>
<br>During James IV's reign Atholl seems to have been uninvolved in high politics, concentrating instead on his interests in Perthshire. In 1502&#150;4 he and his adherents, particularly his son-in-law Neil Stewart of Fortingall, clashed with the king's government over the policy of feu-ferming crown lands in highland Perthshire. In 1502 Neil Stewart attacked and destroyed the castle of Weem, the stronghold of Sir Robert Menzies, who had been the chief beneficiary and agent of James IV's feu-ferming of crown lands in the area, apparently with the active support or connivance of Atholl's son and heir, John, master of Atholl. In May 1504 Atholl's support for Stewart of Fortingall and his failure to help prosecute those who took part in the attack on Weem resulted in his being summoned for treason alongside Stewart. The two men appeared before parliament on 8 June 1504 and agreed to answer the (unspecified) charges against them. There is no further record of process against Atholl. It seems likely that he was swiftly reconciled to the king; there is certainly no indication that he was ever forfeited.<br>
<br>Atholl is said to have died at the Laighwood, near Dunkeld, on 15 September 1512; he was buried in Dunkeld Cathedral. He was twice married. His first wife, Margaret Douglas, known as the Fair Maid of Galloway, had died before 8 December 1476, by which date Atholl had married Eleanor Sinclair, daughter of William, earl of Orkney and Caithness. John's marriages produced two sons. The elder son, John, succeeded his father as earl of Atholl and died in 1521, while the second son, Andrew, followed an ecclesiastical career. He was elected bishop of Dunkeld in 1515, but failed to obtain papal confirmation and was replaced by Gavin Douglas; in 1517 Andrew became bishop of Caithness. He died before 9 August 1541. John also had numerous daughters, including: Joan, who married Alexander Gordon (later third earl of Huntly) before 16 December 1482; Christian, who married Neil Stewart of Fortingall under the terms of a settlement between Atholl and Neil's father, also Neil, on 22 January 1478, died on 30 May 1538, and was buried in Dunkeld Cathedral; Marjory, who married Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and died on 26 July 1524; Elspeth, who married Robert Innes of Innermarkie; Elizabeth, who married Andrew, second Lord Gray, before 1483; another Elizabeth, who married Alexander Robertson of Strowan before 24 January 1505; and another (or the same) Elizabeth, who was contracted in marriage to John Stewart, earl of Lennox, on 19 January 1512.<br>
