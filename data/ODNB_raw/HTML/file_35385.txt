<span class="headword">Parker,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jacob Solomons]</span>  (1875&#150;1952), <span class="occ">theatre historian</span>, was born Jacob Solomons in New York on 28 July 1875, the only child of David Solomons and his wife, Florence Joel. His father was a native of Warsaw, but all family links with Poland were lost after his death by drowning in 1881; some sources described him as a sailor, though for his marriage certificate his son recorded his occupation as cashier in an insurance office. The widow, who had been born in Cardiff, decided to return to the United Kingdom where some of her family still lived; choosing to keep both her son and her independence, she took the post of caretaker at Clarence Chambers, King William Street, in the City of London, and enrolled her son at the Whitechapel foundation school, where he was a fellow pupil of Herman Finck.<br>
<br>After a short period as an office boy Jacob Solomons accepted the offer of a commercial acquaintance to return to the United States to improve his prospects, but within a few months he found himself stranded and obliged to work his passage back to England. It was about this time that he decided, on the advice of his mother, to adopt the name John Parker, which he legalized in 1917. While working as a commercial clerk he married, on 8 February 1899, Edith Maud Pizey (1875/6&#150;1942), daughter of Montague Belfield Pizey, schoolmaster. They had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>There is evidence that between the years 1892 and 1903, while employed in various capacities, Parker had made a start in journalism; he soon became sufficiently well informed on theatrical matters to be able to write to the eminent critic Clement Scott of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and point out errors of fact where they occurred in his columns. This enthusiasm and passion for accuracy appealed to Scott, who allowed the boy the pleasure of carrying his copy to the newspaper office, encouraged his talent for research, and from 1900 published regular contributions from him in his weekly paper the <span class="italic">Free Lance</span>. In 1903 Parker was appointed London manager, critic, and correspondent of the <span class="italic">New York Dramatic News</span>, a post which he held for seventeen years, and in the same year he was made the London correspondent of the <span class="italic">New York Dramatic Mirror</span>. From 1901 until his death, Parker managed to divide his time between his business as a shipping agent and his work for the theatre which was his first love.<br>
<br>During the nineteenth century several reference works of dramatic biography appeared, but none of these was to reach more than two issues. For the 1907 edition of the <span class="italic">Green Room Book</span> Parker was invited to provide additional information for the biographies and to contribute the entire section on the American theatre. He then succeeded as editor but was able to bring out only two more editions (1908 and 1909) before it came to an end with the death of the publisher.<br>
<br>Parker's reputation as a theatre historian had by this time become well established, and in 1912 Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons published his new venture, <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span>. The success of the very first edition brought from Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree the commendation &#145;As a monument of industry, <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span> seems to me to be absolutely pyramidal. &hellip; It is a work which assuredly deserves the gratitude of everyone connected with the theatre&#146;. Over a period of forty years, until his death, and surviving the publishing hazards of two world wars, Parker compiled eleven editions of his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> almost single-handed, an astonishing achievement in view of the ever-expanding spheres of the theatre with the growth of the cinema and television. His success as an editor lay in the accuracy and balance of his records. The motto which headed his editorial stationery, <span class="italic">Sine timore, aut favore</span>, indicated his inflexible rule, a rule which made him a number of enemies in the profession, principally by his refusal to allow his subjects to falsify their ages. It is conceivable that the unsolved mystery of the burglary of his study in September 1928 was the work of some aggrieved actor. All Parker's notes and all the copy for his sixth edition, then ready for press, were stolen. After his first shock had subsided, he rewrote in his own hand all the new material, including more than 450 new biographies.<br>
<br>Parker also found time to give active support to the Critics' Circle, of which he was a founder member, honorary secretary (1924&#150;52), and in one year president. In 1937 he represented the Critics' Circle as British delegate at the International Congress of Critics in Paris. He was also the honorary editor of the <span class="italic">Critics' Circular</span>.<br>
<br>With little time to spare for the more conventional recreations, Parker had one passing hobby and one sport, albeit as a spectator. He was an accomplished illuminator, and spent many a Sunday morning, during 1905 and 1906, in nightshirt, silk dressing gown, and smoking cap, designing and carrying out, in all their elaborate colour and gold leaf, two &#145;vellums&#146; for presentation to Lionel Brough and Ellen Terry, respectively, on the celebration of their stage jubilees. His enthusiasm for cricket&#151;he was a member of the Surrey County Cricket Club&#151;was lifelong, but chiefly as a spectator.<br>
<br>Parker was fastidious in both dress and speech. At one time he took lessons in elocution and delighted in imparting what he had learned to his family. His son by his first marriage produced a twelfth edition of <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span> in 1957. In 1944 Parker married, second, Doris Mary, daughter of George Sinclair. He died in a nursing home, 9 Westbourne House, Richmond Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, on 18 November 1952, and was cremated at Mortlake crematorium in London on 24 November.<br>
