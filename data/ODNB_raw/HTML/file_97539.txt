<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wooderson,  Sydney Charles</span>  (1914&#150;2006), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born at 11 Baldwin Crescent, Camberwell, London, on 30 August 1914, the second son of George Thomas Wooderson, fruit merchant, and his wife, Jeannette Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tindall. He and his two brothers, Alfred and Stanley, were all educated at Sutton Valence School in Kent. Taking inspiration from the athletic success of his elder brother, Alfred, Wooderson took up running as a schoolboy, and joined a local athletic club, the Blackheath Harriers. In 1933 he won the London Athletic Club's public schools championship, and became the first schoolboy to run faster than 4 minutes and 30 seconds for the mile. In that year he left school and became articled as a solicitor's clerk in the city of London; he later became a solicitor.<br>
<br>Wooderson's talent was noticed, and he soon became coached by Albert Hill, the double Olympic champion of 1920. Under Hill's guidance he flourished: he finished second to Jack Lovelock of New Zealand in the mile at the second empire games in London in 1934 (Jerry Cornes, who had finished second in the 1500 metres at the 1932 Olympic games, was third), and in 1935 took the first of five successive Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) one mile championships (a record that was never matched in his lifetime), beating Lovelock in the process. After a second defeat by Wooderson in Glasgow in that year (where Wooderson set his first British record of 4 minutes 12.7 seconds for the mile) Lovelock recorded in his journal that &#145;[I] made up my mind to defeat Wooderson next year or die&#146;, and it was the threat from Wooderson that shaped Lovelock's preparation for the 1936 Olympic games  (Colquhoun, 18).<br>
<br>In 1936 Wooderson set a new British record of 4 minutes 10.8 seconds for the mile, and defeated Lovelock in the AAA Championships. However, he injured his left ankle while out walking and failed to qualify for the final of the 1500 metres at the Olympic games in Berlin in that year. Outwardly he showed no sign of his disappointment that the much anticipated contest between himself and Lovelock (who took gold with a new world record) in the Olympic final failed to take place. On 28 August 1937, however, in a handicap race at a Blackheath Harriers' meeting at London University's Motspur Park track, Wooderson set a new world record for the mile of 4 minutes 6.4 seconds. Watching in the crowd were not only Wooderson's parents and his coach, Hill, but Walter George, who as a professional had set a record of 4 minutes 12&frac34; seconds in 1886. Afterwards George was photographed congratulating Wooderson; fifty years later Wooderson himself was present at a meeting at Crystal Palace organized as a tribute to mark the anniversary of his world record which featured the generation of British middle distance athletes of the 1980s, including Sebastian Coe, his successor as world record holder for the mile.<br>
<br>Wooderson's record stood for five years until it was broken by the Swede, Gunder Haegg, in 1942, and it stood as a British record until broken by Roger Bannister in May 1953. Although Wooderson's comparatively light training and approach to the sport (he was scrupulous in returning overpaid expenses) epitomized the British amateur ethos of the day, there was nothing accidental about the world record attempt: four AAA timekeepers were present, and the track had been remeasured in advance and found to be slightly short, so that the start line had been adjusted by 10 inches. Wooderson later recalled &#145;I was quite amazed and could not sleep undisturbed for some days after&#146;  (Thurlow, 17).<br>
<br>The following year, at the same meeting, on 20 August 1937, Wooderson set world records for the 800 metres (1 minute 48.4 seconds) and the 880 yards (1 minute 49.2 seconds), the latter standing as a world record for seventeen years. He was unable to compete in the 1938 empire games (held in Sydney, Australia) because he was taking his legal exams; however, he won the European 1500 metres championship in Paris that year, in a time of 3 minutes 48.4 seconds. Earlier in that year he had declared his ambition to try to run a mile in 4 minutes. In 1939, running on a grass track at Fallowfield in Manchester, he became the first man ever to break 3 minutes for three-quarters of a mile (setting a world record of 2:59.5), and was seen as a strong contender for the 1500 metres at the 1940 Olympic games, originally due to be held in Tokyo, then in Helsinki. His one notable appearance outside Europe, which took place at the &#145;mile of the century&#146; in Princeton that year, was a disappointment, and he finished fifth.<br>
<br>Wooderson's unlikely appearance for a leading world athlete was much commented upon; he was short (5 feet 6 inches tall) and slight (weighing less than 9 stone). He was also short-sighted and wore rimmed spectacles when racing. His appearance captured the public imagination, particularly in the immediate post-war period, and one observer has commented that this &#145;frail, bespectacled figure&#146; symbolized the &#145;courage and endurance of the indomitable Englishman&#146;  (Holt, 275). Harold Abrahams wrote of a &#145;tiny figure &hellip; buffeted and almost apologising for occupying any space at all &hellip; the last person you would pick out as a king among milers&#146;  (Bryant, 102). One account characterized his defeats of Lovelock as &#145;like a goods train passing an express&#146;  (Lovesey, 86). His contests with the stylish Lovelock were one of the high points of athletics in the 1930s. Wooderson's frailty was deceptive, however: on the running track he cultivated an unmatchable finishing pace, and Lovelock commented in his private journal that Wooderson was &#145;so cool, clever and fast&#146;  (Colquhoun, 141).<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War interrupted Wooderson's athletic career, and undoubtedly prevented him from fulfilling his potential as an athlete. Although his poor eyesight precluded him from active service, he joined the National Fire Service and was stationed in Croydon during the blitz, and then the Pioneer Corps and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He also participated in a number of wartime exhibition races, but in 1944 suffered a bout of rheumatic flu, which led to four months in hospital, and he received medical advice that he would never run competitively again.<br>
<br>Remarkably, Wooderson made a full recovery, and it was his appearances in front of large crowds in the athletic meetings of the immediate post-war period that undoubtedly confirmed his iconic status for spectators of sport of that generation. Among the estimated 60,000 people who saw his narrow defeat by Arne Andersson at the White City stadium on 6 August 1945 was the sixteen-year-old Roger Bannister, who later recalled that from this day Wooderson became his hero and gave him a schoolboy dream of becoming a runner  (Bannister, 30). In a rematch in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, a few weeks later on 9 September, Wooderson was again defeated, but ran his fastest ever mile of 4 minutes 4.2 seconds. In 1946 he set a British record for the 3 miles, winning the AAA championship at that distance, and then won the European 5000 metre championship in Oslo in a time of 14 minutes 8.6 seconds, beating the young Emil Zatopek in the process. An injury in a 2 mile race at Motspur Park track later that year ended his track career, but he competed for Blackheath Harriers in the English national cross-country championships between 1947 and 1949, winning the title in 1948. He was president of Blackheath Harriers in 1946 and 1969 (the latter their centennial year) and continued to support the club for many years. In 1947, on his retirement from track competition, the AAA arranged for a dinner in his honour, a &#145;unique tribute to a phenomenal runner and a man as popular with other athletes as with the public&#146;  (Lovesey, 95). In 1952 he was part of a small group of Britain's most famous athletes presented to the new Queen Elizabeth at the AAA championships in that year.<br>
<br>Wooderson married Pamela Lucy Willcocks, a 25-year-old secretary, and daughter of William Willcocks, gardener, on 15 April 1950, at St Paul's Church, Kingston Hill, Surrey. They had a son and a daughter. Always a modest man, after retirement from athletics Wooderson avoided public attention and retired to Devon and then Dorset. There was some discussion as to whether he was snubbed by the organizers of the 1948 London Olympic games, who failed to ask him to participate in bringing the Olympic torch into the stadium at Wembley, preferring instead a lesser known but more classically stylish athlete; one account states that Queen Elizabeth commented, &#145;of course we couldn't have had poor little Sydney&#146;, and late in life Wooderson claimed he had arrived on the opening day of the games as requested to bring the Olympic torch into the stadium, only to be told he was not required  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 December 2006). A campaign led by Chris Brasher resulted in Wooderson being made an MBE in 2000, by which time he was virtually blind. He died at Anglebury Court residential care home in Wareham, Dorset, on 21 December 2006, suffering from Parkinson's disease and Crohn's disease. He was survived by his wife, Pamela and their two children. A memorial service took place on 8 September 2007, and the Blackheath Harriers' clubhouse was renamed in his honour.<br>
