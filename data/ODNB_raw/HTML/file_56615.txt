<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Parnell,  Valentine Charles</span>  (1892&#150;1972), <span class="occ">theatre manager and impresario</span>, was born at 7 Trelawney Road, Hackney, London, on 14 February 1892, one of six sons of Thomas Frederick Parnell (1862&#150;1957), journalist, and his wife, Elizabeth White. His father was for a time editor of the <span class="italic">Hackney Gazette</span> but was better known as a ventriloquist who used the name Fred Russell to avoid association with the Irish politician Charles Parnell. With his puppet &#145;Coster Joe&#146;, he was much in demand as a music-hall act between 1896 and 1930 and was honoured with an OBE.<br>
<br>Val Parnell was educated at Godwin College, Margate, but at the age of thirteen he began work in the offices of Sir Walter de Frece's expanding circuit of music-halls. In 1914 he enlisted in the Queen's Own 20th regiment and served with this throughout the war. In 1918 he rejoined de Frece, and when the circuit was taken over by Charles Gulliver's London Theatres of Variety (LTV) in 1919, Parnell became booking manager for ten of Gulliver's provincial theatres. Finding he was unable to book top acts because of the competition of the more powerful Moss Empires circuit, Parnell responded by booking a greater number of acts for shorter turns, thus providing a show which ran faster than those of his rivals. He was later to use the same &#145;high-speed variety&#146; technique&#151;though this time with big names&#151;to revive the fortunes of the London Palladium.<br>
<br>In 1928 LTV's circuit was bought by Sir Walter Gibbons who, with the financier F. A. Szarvasy, was establishing the General Theatres Corporation (GTC) as a nationwide circuit of cinemas and music-halls. Parnell became booking manager for GTC's variety theatres, but the corporation proved to be an ill-starred venture and was rapidly swallowed by the rival Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56528/', "George Black")</script> assumed responsibility for GTC's variety halls, and also from November 1932, for about thirty Moss Empires which Gaumont-British had bought up to forestall them being converted into cinemas. With Parnell as his assistant, Black set out to make the London Palladium, the most impressive of GTC's halls, the flagship of a substantial circuit devoted to live entertainment within a corporation set up to exploit the potential of the cinema. Together the two men kept alive the British music-hall tradition for a period of thirty years after the coming of the &#145;talkies&#146; had seemed to spell its doom.<br>
<br>After seeing a revue at the Nottingham Hippodrome where comedians Jimmy Nervo and Teddy Knox persistently disrupted the acts of the other performers, Parnell had the idea of teaming them with two other comic duos, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold and Billy Caryll and his wife Hilda Mundy in a &#145;Crazy Week&#146; at the Palladium. Other &#145;Crazy Weeks&#146; followed and by the middle of 1932 the classic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64586/', "Crazy Gang")</script> team had been assembled with Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen, and the French-talking juggler Monsewer Eddie Gray, replacing Caryll and Mundy. The Crazy Gang were to be the mainstay of the Palladium programmes until 1940 when for a time they went their separate ways and George Black introduced a series of wartime revue shows.<br>
<br>In March 1945 Black died and Parnell succeeded him as managing director of Moss Empires and director of GTC in charge of their variety halls. At the Palladium Parnell restored classic twice nightly variety bills, but with a major innovation: most of his top of the bill artists were American and many of them were Hollywood film stars. The new policy began unpromisingly with Mickey Rooney, whose brash egocentricity offended austerity-ridden British audiences. It was triumphantly vindicated by Danny Kaye, in 1948 only a minor film star but one whose abilities as a live performer attracted great admiration in Britain. Parnell chose his acts carefully, relying either on performers who had a background in vaudeville as well as the cinema, or on artists like Frank Sinatra with a wide experience of live performance. Parnell was criticized for neglecting home-grown talent, but there were few British artists who could fill the 2200 seats of the Palladium, and Parnell was responsible for the return of one of those who could&#151;Gracie Fields.<br>
<br>In 1955 Parnell began a new career as a television executive, becoming managing director and subsequently chief executive of Associated Television, for which company he produced the hugely successful &#145;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&#146;. At its height in the early sixties the show reached an audience of over twenty million people. In September 1962 Parnell resigned from his television posts to give younger executives a chance. He was already over seventy and was succeeded by his deputy, Lew (later Lord) Grade.<br>
<br>Val Parnell divorced his first wife, Dolly, in 1914 and married Helen Howell, a dancer, in 1938; this marriage was dissolved in 1963. Three years later he married the singer Aileen Cochrane. He also had a long-term relationship with the actress (and star of ATV's <span class="italic">Crossroads</span>) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58795/', "(Joan) Noel Gordon (1919&#150;1985)")</script>. Parnell had one adopted son. He died from a heart attack on 22 September 1972 at 64 Portsea Hall, Portsea Place, London, aged eighty. A big man&#151;6 feet 2 inches tall with the stature of a heavyweight boxer&#151;Val Parnell was renowned as a tough but fair businessman. He dressed very modestly, and his appearance was said to suggest success in banking rather than in the theatre. A gift from Frank Sinatra bearing the inscription &#145;To the real star of the Palladium, Val Parnell&#146; indicates the admiration he commanded in the field of show business.<br>
<br>&#145;For forty years&#146;, commented Parnell's obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;much that was best in variety and light entertainment passed through his hands to be presented with skill, speed, slickness and panache&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Sept 1972).<br>
