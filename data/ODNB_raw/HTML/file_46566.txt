<span class="headword">Adam,  William</span>  (1828&#150;1898), <span class="occ">carpet manufacturer</span>, was born on 10 June 1828 in Paisley, the eldest of five children and the only son of Peter Adam (<i>c</i>.1798&#150;1861), hand-loom weaver, and his wife, Elisa.<br>
<br>Adam began his career in Paisley, working as a hand-loom cotton weaver and later as a warehouseman. On 16 June 1854 he married Agnes, daughter of John Thomson of Paisley, moving soon afterwards to Glasgow where two of their sons and a daughter were born. He was employed as a foreman in James Templeton's carpet manufacturing business where he gained a thorough understanding of the chenille Axminster hand-loom weaving process which his employer had patented in 1839.<br>
<br>In the late 1850s Adam left Scotland for Kidderminster where he introduced the chenille Axminster process to Brinton and Lewis, a leading Kidderminster firm which made Brussels carpeting. Less than a year later, however, he went into partnership with George Race, a cashier of the firm, and together they founded their own chenille Axminster rug manufacturing business. The partnership was dissolved in September 1862 and Adam then became manager of the rug making business of H. R. Willis of Kidderminster.<br>
<br>In 1869 Adam made the decision which was to transform his future, entering into a partnership with Michael Tomkinson (1841&#150;1921) to found the Kidderminster firm that later played a major role in the British carpet industry and helped to make Axminster carpeting a familiar object in middle-class homes. Tomkinson supplied the leadership and commercial acumen, but Adam's contribution in technical and production aspects was no less vital.<br>
<br>In 1878 when Tomkinson took a major new initiative by purchasing in the USA the United Kingdom rights to Halcyon Skinner's spool Axminster loom, it was Adam who ensured that spool Axminster looms were speedily installed and fully operational. However, his biggest achievement was the invention of a successful setting power-loom for weaving chenille Axminster carpeting, patented in 1880&#150;82. Licences to use the invention were granted to three other firms including James Templeton &amp; Co. which had developed a less efficient loom. Meanwhile Tomkinson and Adam were busy installing eighty looms of their own.<br>
<br>Adam's wife, who had borne three more children, died at their residence, Elderslie House, Leswell, Kidderminster, on 14 January 1878. On 1 July 1879 in Derby Adam married Emma (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of Edward Grigg, veterinary surgeon; they had two sons.<br>
<br>The firm of Tomkinson and Adam continued to expand. It was one of the two leading producers of Axminster carpeting in the UK and was to become the fourth largest firm in the carpet industry by the early years of the twentieth century. Adam solved the practical problems involved in the expansion and patented further improvements to chenille and Axminster power-looms. He underwent major surgery in 1893, however, and was less active during the last five years of his life, as his health declined. His eldest sons, Peter and William, had become partners in the firm some years earlier.<br>
<br>Adam was a staunch Liberal, but seldom appeared on public platforms. He was a strong supporter of the temperance movement and a vice-president of the Midland Temperance League. In later life he served as a JP for Kidderminster. A devout nonconformist, he attended the countess of Huntingdon's chapel in Kidderminster, and then for the last twenty-five years of his life the Old Meeting-House, later known as Baxter Congregational Church. Adam was made a deacon in 1876, and served on the executive of the Worcestershire Union of Congregational Churches. He made numerous charitable donations privately and supported various congregational churches in Worcestershire. The largest public gift was &pound;1250 towards the cost of Baxter Church, erected in 1884. However, in the year before he died he bought a country estate of over 2000 acres at Buckland, Gloucestershire, for &pound;50,000.<br>
<br>Adam died of apoplexy on 13 December 1898 at Elderslie House, Leswell, Kidderminster, where he had lived for many years since leaving Scotland. The funeral was at Baxter Church and he was buried in Kidderminster cemetery on 17 December 1898.<br>
