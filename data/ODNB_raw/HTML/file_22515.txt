<span class="headword">Poole,  John</span>  (1785/6&#150;1872), <span class="occ">playwright and writer</span>, was deliberately vague concerning his early life, his &#145;Notes for a memoir&#146; (1831), published in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, revealing no more than the fuller <span class="italic">Sketches and Recollections</span> (1835).<br>
<br>Poole's reputation as a theatrical wit was established by the publication of his <span class="italic">Hamlet Travestie</span> in 1810. The characteristic method of this three-act version is to intersperse Shakespeare's familiar lines with Regency colloquialisms, locking the two styles together in a sequence of doggerel rhyming couplets. A two-act version was selected by the low comedian John Liston for his Drury Lane benefit on 17 June 1813. Charles Mathews the elder played a comic Hamlet and Liston played Ophelia. It was the first of eight collaborations between playwright and actor. Like any jobbing dramatist of the period, Poole was adept at supplying vehicles for leading performers. The names of the characters Liston played for Poole (Tristram Sappy in <span class="italic">Deaf as a Post</span>, Van Dunder in <span class="italic">'Twould Puzzle a Conjuror</span>, Simon Pengander in <span class="italic">'Twixt the Cup and the Lip</span>, Von Noodle in <span class="italic">The Young Hopefuls</span>) fairly indicate the nature of the relationship, which reached its high point when Liston played the title role in <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span>, which opened at the Haymarket on 13 September 1825. &#145;Go where you would 40 years ago&#146;, noted <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 31 August 1866, &#145;you could not, by any means, avoid <span class="roman">Paul Pry</span>.&#146; It was, perhaps, the most popular single piece on the London stage since <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> in 1728.<br>
<br>Sadly, Poole blamed Liston for the failure of <span class="italic">The Young Hopefuls</span> at the Olympic on 15 March 1832, and refused to write for him again. Poole had a reputation for quarrelsomeness, and his witticisms often had a vindictive edge, but his contributions were welcomed at dinner tables and by magazine editors for more than thirty years, until, in 1845, he subsided into sudden literary silence. A portrait frontispiece to <span class="italic">Sketches and Recollections</span> shows a handsome, clean-cut face, well suiting his evident status as a society gentleman. During his prosperous years he was prominent in the Garrick Club, where he displayed a talent for making enemies. The actor William Macready, a sensitive victim of his gibes, called Poole &#145;that very wretched creature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.385), and yet Poole counted Macready among his friends. There were too few of these, and when in 1845 Poole found himself, for whatever reason, unable to write, he became dependent on the kindness of the three men most loyal to him, Thomas Noon Talfourd, John Forster, and Charles Dickens. Together they negotiated for him grants of &pound;80 and &pound;50 from the Royal Literary Fund in 1846 and 1849, and in 1847 Dickens donated a part of the proceeds from his amateur theatrical &#145;celebrity&#146; performances at Liverpool and Manchester to the impoverished playwright.<br>
<br>Perhaps in the belief that he could live more cheaply there, Poole had taken up residence in Paris in 1846. Dickens saw him there in June 1850, and, shocked by his severe physical deterioration, wrote to the prime minister on 18 December 1850, pleading that Poole be given a civil-list pension. At the age of sixty-four, Dickens explained, Poole was in a &#145;prematurely shattered state&#146;, virtually unable to write even a simple sentence, his hands shaking and his whole body &#145;trembling and staggering over a small wood fire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 6.239&#150;40). Within a week Lord John Russell announced the award of a pension of &pound;100 per year. The pension sustained Poole for the rest of his long life. From Paris in 1853, Dickens reported that he &#145;looks quite fresh and well&#151;and is, if possible, more disagreeable than ever&#146;  (ibid., 7.164). The recovery was partial, although Poole's much observed eccentricities may have owed something to the taste for French brandy that the pension allowed him to indulge. (He was, for example, seen to insert a pinch of snuff into the marble nostril of Mlle Clairon's bust at the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise.) Towards the end of his life Poole returned to London. He died at his home at 67 Highgate Road, Kentish Town, on 4 February 1872, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 10 February.<br>
<br>Poole never married: &#145;I doubt it may be but a rusty instrument for want of use, the Pooleish heart&#146;, wrote Dickens in 1846  (4.686). He was the author of some forty now forgotten plays, but his <span class="italic">Hamlet Travestie</span> was the witty model for its several successors, and <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span> has the distinction of adding the catchphrase &#145;I hope I don't intrude&#146; to the comic discourse of at least two generations. He capitalized on the play's success in a long series of humorous essays, brought together in <span class="italic">Paul Pry's Journal of a Residence at Little Pedlington</span> (1836), <span class="italic">Paul Pry's Delicate Attentions</span> (1837), and <span class="italic">Little Pedlington and the Pedlingtonians</span> (1839), which still provide lively insight into a period's taste in humour.<br>
