<span class="headword">Franklin <span class="st"> [Frankelin]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1610), <span class="occ">self-proclaimed reincarnation of Christ</span>, seems to have been born at Overton, near Andover, in Hampshire, about the year 1610. It was to be said of him that he became an apprentice rope-maker in London and that he married about 1634. In 1650 he was reported to have a wife and three children living in Stepney. If so, he may be identified with the William Franklin, rope-maker of Ratcliffe Highway, who had four children by his wife, Margery, baptized in the parish of St Dunstan, Stepney, between January 1639 and October 1642. Franklin was accounted a &#145;civil man&#146;, &#145;well esteemed&#146; for his zealous and constant observance of gospel ordinances. He was a member of a gathered congregation (perhaps that presided over by William Greenhill) and regarded by the godly as an &#145;eminent Saint&#146;. In 1646, having been &#145;much afflicted&#146; by the plague and apparently &#145;somewhat distracted in his brain&#146;, Franklin was bled &#145;divers times&#146; by a surgeon  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 6). During his sufferings he was alleged to have blasphemed, &#145;saying, <i>That he was God, that he was</i> <i>Christ</i>&#146;. Upon his recovery Franklin repented, declaring that he had been seduced by the wiles of Satan. Afterwards, however, he &#145;plunged&#146; deeper still into &#145;such spiritual delusions&#146;, pretending that he had &#145;received some Revelations and Visions&#146;. He may have become acquainted with those that denied &#145;Ordinances, Scriptures, Christ&#146;, and supposedly claimed that he had the gift of prophecy. In addition, he imagined that he could &#145;speak with new Tongues&#146; and would &#145;babble out words&#146; which neither he nor others were able to understand. Franklin was also said to have ceased carnal relations with his wife and &#145;to keep company with other women&#146;. For &#145;all which evils&#146; he was excluded by his congregation  (ibid., 7).<br>
<br>Some time in 1649 Franklin was introduced to <a name="cosubject_69083"></a><span class="headword">Mary Gadbury</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1619)<span class="occ"></span>, the wife of James Gadbury, by a woman living with Gadbury. Mary Gadbury may have been the Mary Pakeman who, aged about eighteen, married James Gadbury by licence in the parish of St Gregory by St Paul's, London, in September 1637. In 1643 or thereabouts, James Gadbury had deserted his wife and gone to the Netherlands with a servant; Mary had pursued her husband across the sea but to no avail. On her return she lived with a daughter in London, mainly in Watling Street, finding employment as a seller of &#145;Laces, pins, Bandstrings, and other trifles for Gentlewomen&#146;. A &#145;frequent hearer of the Word&#146;, Mary Gadbury gadded &#145;chiefly&#146; to the sermons of John Goodwin and Henry Jessey  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 8). After their meeting with Franklin, Gadbury and her introductor began to sing joyously. Gadbury, moreover, confessed that she was possessed by &#145;certain Fits&#146; which would &#145;set her whole body in a trembling&#146;  (ibid., 9, 10). She also acknowledged that a voice within began to speak to her in &#145;Parables&#146;, saying that &#145;the Lord would send his Son to raign in the person of a man&#146;. Soon after Franklin arrived at Gadbury's house and convinced her that he was the Son of God come to earth in &#145;a new body&#146;  (ibid., 11). Franklin later stayed the night with Gadbury, perhaps lying in &#145;the same bed&#146; as her, for which she was accused by her neighbours of keeping a &#145;naughty house&#146;  (ibid., 13). It was probably about this time that Gadbury heard &#145;the Voyce&#146; of the Lord &#145;bid her sell what she had, and follow him&#146;. She obeyed and departed with Franklin to Hampshire&#151;&#145;the Land of <i>Ham</i>&#146; of <span class="roman">Psalm</span> 105: 23  (ibid., 13, 14).<br>
<br>In November 1649 Franklin and Gadbury arrived in Andover on the wagon that travelled weekly between there and London. While lodging at The Star inn Franklin began to preach. His obscure yet seemingly spiritual words, delivered with &#145;a very plausible and affected (though slow) manner of speech&#146;, began to attract attention  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 17). Thereupon, Franklin departed for London. In his absence Gadbury spread a rumour that she had seen Christ &#145;in the person of a man&#146;&#151;her account of &#145;a plaine man in gray cloaths&#146; answered to Franklin's description  (ibid., 18, 19). Gadbury, moreover, perhaps now pregnant with Franklin's illegitimate child, declared that she was like &#145;a woman in travail&#146;  (ibid., 20). At her trial she reportedly claimed that<blockquote>shee was ye bride &amp; ye Spouse ye lambes wife &hellip; ye Virgin Mary yt bare Christ &amp; yt shee was deliured &hellip; of a fiery flyeing serp[an]t and of ye old dragon w[hi]ch shee had sent unto ye place of perdition. (Clarke MS 18, fols. 27<i>v</i>&#150;28<i>r</i>)</blockquote>A disciple likewise affirmed that he had seen her &#145;delivered&#146; of &#145;a Dragon&#146;, suggesting that her initial hope of procreating the saviour of the world was transformed by the ensuing misshapen stillborn  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 22).<br>
<br>Franklin returned from London on 8 December only to find a cold welcome at The Star inn. Warned &#145;to depart&#146;, he and Gadbury left Andover bound for the village of &#145;Crooxeason&#146; (Crux Easton). There they were entertained for six weeks or so by the local minister, William Woodward, and his wife, Margaret  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 25). While at Crux Easton Franklin began to preach at Woodward's house, declaring that he was &#145;ye Christ crucified without ye gates of Jerusalem ye son of god &amp; saviour of ye world&#146;, &#145;the Lion of the Tribe of Judah&#146; that had &#145;the key of the bottomlesse pit&#146; &#145;and yt he was come to gather ye elect&#146; (Clarke MS 18, fol. 27<i>v</i>; Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 31). He soon attracted followers to whom he assigned &#145;offices and titles&#146;. One was John the Baptist, &#145;sent forth to tell that <i>Christ</i> <i>was come upon the earth</i>&#146;. Another was a &#145;destroying&#146; angel &#145;sent forth to curse the earth&#146; (a figure from the <span class="roman">Revelation</span>). Another still was usually a &#145;healing&#146; angel, but at other times &#145;one of the two Witnesses&#146; (of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 11: 3; Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 31&#150;2).<br>
<br>Franklin and three of his adherents were apprehended by warrant and brought to Winchester on 27 January 1650. Witnesses were examined before two justices of the peace and a recantation drawn up and offered to Franklin. To this he subscribed his name. Gadbury proved more obdurate and was dispatched to &#145;the house of Correction&#146;  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 44). Chastened and whipped, she recanted by subscribing her mark. While imprisoned the pair were questioned by Humphrey Ellis, a minister of the cathedral church of Winchester. Ellis, who had previously preached a sermon warning of &#145;the abundance of heresies, and the great increase of false christs, false teachers, and deceivers amongst us&#146;, found Franklin &#145;very ignorant&#146; in the &#145;Principles&#146; of religion (Ellis, <span class="italic">Two Sermons</span>, 30; Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 48). Ellis supposed that Franklin had &#145;sucked&#146; his &#145;wicked Principles&#146; from &#145;the Familists&#146;, though he added that Franklin was &#145;sometime a zealous Professor [of] <i>Anabaptism</i>&#146;  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 48, 60, 59). Franklin and Gadbury were subsequently tried at the assize (western circuit) beginning on 7 March 1650 before Lord Chief Justice Henry Rolle. Franklin was sentenced to remain in gaol &#145;till he give good security for his good behaviour&#146;. Gadbury received further &#145;correction&#146; before eventually being released at the quarter sessions held the week after Easter  (ibid., 51, 52). On 22 April she left Winchester on the wagon that travelled weekly between there and London. Nothing else is known of her.<br>
<br>In May, Ellis published his relation of the &#145;Grand Impostures&#146; of William Franklin and Mary Gadbury. It was entitled <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>. After the Restoration, Thomas Comber used Ellis's account in his denunciation of the &#145;Several Kinds of Inspirations and Revelations Pretended to by the Quakers&#146;. Comber's index referred his readers to &#145;Frankelin &hellip; <i>and the Hamp-shire Revealers</i>&#146;  (Comber, title-page, index). The number of Franklin's followers, however, remains unknown (contemporary estimates of 500 or 600 converts appear exaggerated). In June 1666 William Woodward, having previously had his Hampshire living &#145;sequestred from him&#146;, was deprived of his living of Trottescliffe, Kent  (Ellis, <span class="italic">Pseudochristus</span>, 52). Woodward had been charged with uttering profane and blasphemous speeches: that the Lord's prayer was not commanded to be used, that the Church of England might as well be called the Church of Rome, that he had attained such perfection that he could not sin, and that one &#145;William Franeklin&#146;, a rope-maker who had lived with him, was the Christ and Saviour.<br>
