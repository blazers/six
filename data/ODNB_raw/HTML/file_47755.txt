<span class="headword">Narayan, Jayaprakash</span>  (1902&#150;1979), <span class="occ">political activist and social worker</span>, was born on 11 October 1902 in the village of Shitab Diara, Bihar, in an upper caste (Kayastha) family of modest means, the fourth of six children of Harsu Dayal, a government official, and his wife, Phul Rani Devi. He had two brothers and three sisters. He married Prabhavati Devi (<i>d</i>. 1973) in October 1920 when he was eighteen and she fourteen. Although the marriage was never physically consummated, Prabhavati having been persuaded by Mahatma Gandhi to take a vow of lifelong celibacy, they lived in all other respects throughout their mature lives together in close companionship. Aside from his association with a &#145;Communist Free Lovers' Club&#146; during his time at the University of Wisconsin, there is no other indication of an active sexual life, and he left no descendants. Jayaprakash, or J. P. as he was often called, was a tall, lean, and handsome man, somewhat austere and aloof in appearance, though in fact gentle and agreeable in his personal relationships.<br>
<br>Narayan's early education in Patna, at the Patna collegiate school and Patna College, was disrupted by his participation in the non-co-operation movement of 1921. Although he enrolled briefly thereafter in a new nationalist institution, Bihar Vidyapith, he completed his education in the United States, where he lived between 1922 and 1929. He took courses at the University of California at Berkeley, Iowa University, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Ohio State University, where he received BA and MA degrees in 1928 and 1929 respectively, supporting himself throughout by taking various odd jobs. Although his early interests were in science subjects, he came under the influence of communist and socialist teachers and students at the University of Wisconsin, leading to a change towards sociology, in which he received his MA degree.<br>
<br>Narayan was prevented from studying for a PhD by news of his mother's illness, which brought him back to India, where vigorous nationalist activities were under way. Through his wife, whose father was a very important Bihar politician, and who herself was ensconced in Gandhi's <i>ashram</i> at Ahmadabad, Narayan soon found himself at the centre of nationalist politics and in personal contact with both Gandhi and Nehru. Although he came close to and worked with Nehru at first, he immediately carved out a singular position for himself as the leading exponent of the position that the Indian National Congress must articulate a social and economic programme that went beyond the mere demand for independence from British rule. In 1934 he was one of a small group who formed the Congress Socialist Party, of which he became general secretary, to work within the Indian National Congress, seeking to influence the social and economic policies of the parent organization.<br>
<br>Narayan participated actively in most of the major movements against British rule after his return to India, and was imprisoned in 1932, in 1940, and again in 1943, emerging from gaol only in April 1946. He was one of the leading socialist figures in the Quit India movement of 1942, having escaped from prison in September of that year.<br>
<br>After the achievement of Indian independence in 1947 Narayan and several of his colleagues in the Congress Socialist Party severed their ties with the parent body to form a party of opposition initially called the Socialist Party, but renamed the Praja Socialist Party (PSP) after a merger with another party in 1953. In 1954 he announced his retirement from politics to join the Sarvodaya movement for social reconstruction in the countryside, emphasizing voluntary land redistribution, communal land ownership, small-scale production, and self-sufficient, self-governing village communities, but he did not finally sever his relations with the PSP until 1957. These shifts in his principal activities in Indian public life were all marked by major breaks in his political thought: from Marxism and sympathy with Soviet communism to disenchantment with the latter as well as with Indian communist practices and a shift to democratic socialism, followed by disenchantment with party politics and a shift to constructive social work and moral criticism of political authority and, finally, disillusionment with the pace and effectiveness of Sarvodaya and a call for total revolution in the moral, economic, and social bases of society through struggle, including mass movements when necessary.<br>
<br>During his years of retirement from active politics J. P. sought nevertheless to influence government policy and public opinion through his prolific writings on contemporary political issues, domestic and international; through public speeches and exhortations to the country's political leaders; and by offering his services as an impartial negotiator. He was also active in organizing relief activities in times of disaster and catastrophe, such as during the 1966&#150;7 Bihar famine.<br>
<br>However, Narayan's most important and dramatic single contribution to his country's history occurred between 1974 and 1977, when he emerged from political retirement to lead the developing movement of opposition in different parts of the country to what he considered to be the dictatorial leadership of the prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and the debasement of politics which had occurred during the previous decade as the Indian National Congress became increasingly corrupted and its members sycophantically dependent upon Mrs Gandhi, her family, and her political entourage. It was at this time also that he gave his new call for a &#145;total revolution&#146;. He was detained along with most other opposition leaders and many thousands of activists during the two-year emergency authoritarian regime imposed by Mrs Gandhi between 1975 and 1977. Despite broken health from confinement, he lived long enough to play a central role in forging the opposition unity which made possible the defeat of Mrs Gandhi and the Indian National Congress in the 1977 parliamentary elections, and the restoration of the basic features of the previous parliamentary system by the Janata government which succeeded hers. Jayaprakash Narayan survived, melancholy at the disintegration of the Janata Party and government in July 1979, in ill health and on dialysis, until his death, in Patna, on 8 October 1979.<br>
