<span class="headword">Kingsford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bonus]</span>,  Anna <span class="st"> [Annie]</span></span>  (1846&#150;1888), <span class="occ">physician and spiritualist</span>, was born on 16 September 1846 at Maryland Point, Stratford, Essex. She was a sickly child, the youngest daughter of twelve children born to Elizabeth Ann Schr&ouml;der and her husband, John Bonus (<i>d</i>. 1865), a London merchant and shipowner. According to Kingsford's spiritual soulmate and biographer Edward Maitland (1824&#150;1897), who believed Kingsford to be a &#145;special instrument of the Gods&#146;  (Maitland, 1.114), the Bonuses were descended from &#145;a great Italian family&#146;  (ibid., 1), one of whom was a cardinal &#145;of strong mystical tendencies&#146;  (ibid.). If this is true, then it might explain where the origins of Kingsford's own clairvoyant talents lay. As a child she would converse with flowers and believed herself to be a fairy, and at an early age displayed mystical &#145;powers&#146; of premonition. As an adult she functioned within two fringe movements: theosophy, which sought a mystical and intuitive understanding of and contact with the divine, and spiritualism, which supported the idea of the existence of the human character after death and the ability of the dead to communicate with the living via a medium. Kingsford often attended seances with Maitland, received religious information by means of dreams (many of which were published in <span class="italic">Dreams and Dream Stories</span>, 1888), and discovered a strong spiritual affinity with, among others, Anne Boleyn and Joan of Arc. As an adolescent she also demonstrated her talents as an author: at thirteen she wrote her first book, <span class="italic">Beatrice: a Tale of the Early Christians</span> (1863), and received 2 guineas from the publishers for her efforts. Thereafter followed a series of poems for the <span class="italic">Churchman's Companion</span>. She continued writing throughout her life, expounding her (radical) views on spiritualism, vegetarianism, and anti-vivisection. She wrote stories under the name of Ninon Kingsford for the <span class="italic">Penny Post</span> from 1868 to 1872 and a series of weekly articles for the <span class="italic">Ladies Pictorial</span> between 1884 and 1887.<br>
<br>On new year's eve 1867 Annie Bonus married her 22-year-old cousin Algernon Godfrey Kingsford (1845&#150;1913), the son of Godfrey Kingsford, a priest, and then moved to Lichfield where Algernon Kingsford trained to enter the ministry. Kingsford soon gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Eadith, an event which did little to improve her poor health. She often lapsed into trance-like states and suffered from severe asthma, epilepsy, neuralgia, and nervous panics which often prevented physical exertion. In 1870 she experienced a religious reawakening after receiving three nocturnal visits from Mary Magdalen. She converted to Catholicism and adopted, alongside her other identities, the names Mary Magdalen Maria Johanna. Kingsford later became somewhat dissatisfied with what she discerned as the materialism and idolatry of Catholicism, and she criticised the Roman Catholic church's avoidance of the vivisection question. Kingsford never seems to have acquired a secure sense of who she was; she was tormented rather than contented by life, and believed that her karma would allow her neither rest nor a peaceful existence.<br>
<br>By the time Kingsford converted to Catholicism her husband had accepted a curacy at Atcham near Shrewsbury which proved detrimental to his wife's health. She decided to remove herself from these deleterious surroundings and also make a life for herself outside her marriage. In 1872 she purchased <span class="italic">The Lady's Own Paper</span>, and divided her time between Shrewsbury and the journal's offices in London. It was at about this time that she made the acquaintance of Edward Maitland. While acting as editor Kingsford was made aware of vivisection after she published a letter by the anti-vivisectionist Frances Power Cobbe, and in 1874 she decided to train for a medical career in order to find out more about medical research. She undertook her training, without her husband and daughter, in France, and received her medical degree in 1880. The topic of her dissertation, &#145;De l'alimentation v&eacute;g&eacute;tale chez l'homme&#146;, reflected her growing animal welfare and vegetarian sentiments, and was eventually published in London in 1881 as <span class="italic">The Perfect Way in Diet</span>. She believed that only with a vegetarian diet would body and soul be united and feed off each other: &#145;his [the vegetarian's] sensuous enjoyments will be keener, his perceptions clearer, his brain stronger, his whole person lighter, purer, and more healthful&#146;  (Kingsford, 504). While studying in France Kingsford apparently suffered a stroke which paralysed her left side, although she seems to have recovered. Kingsford compensated for corporeal weakness by honing her spiritual powers. In 1877 Kingsford and Maitland were &#145;visited&#146; by Sir William Fergusson (1808&#150;1877) who encouraged the pair to work for the abolition of vivisection; she brought to the public's attention the physical damage done to animals and the moral damage done to man in works such as &#145;The uselessness of vivisection&#146; (1882) and <span class="italic">Notes by a Medical Student</span>. In 1880 she sat on the board of the International Society for the Suppression of Vivisection until a conflict among board members over Kingsford's presence and Maitland's pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Woman and the Age</span>, prompted her and Maitland to resign. In 1883 she organized anti-vivisection societies in France and Geneva, and was also, for a brief spell in 1883 and 1884, president of the London lodges of both the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Society, which she founded. Her spiritualism fed into her anti-vivisection activities, and she considered her talents an asset to the cause, especially after she convinced herself that she had willed the French vivisector Claude Bernard's death in 1878. &#145;Oh! I will make it dangerous, nay, deadly, to be a vivisector,&#146; she told Maitland  (Maitland, 1.252).<br>
<br>Alongside her spiritual and anti-vivisection work Kingsford also supported the English women's movement. As early as 1867 she canvassed for signatures for a petition supporting married women's property rights, and her move to London in 1872 facilitated greater participation in women's rights activities by bringing her into contact with many of the feminists of her day, Frances Power Cobbe, Barbara Bodichon, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme. Kingsford contributed to debate by writing in 1868 <span class="italic">An Essay on the Admission of Women to the Parliamentary Franchise</span> wherein she argued for suffrage on the grounds that it would allow women to fulfil their God given functions as responsible citizens. Her active role in the women's rights movement lasted only a short time; she became increasingly frustrated and dissatisfied with what she detected as the denigration of women as wives and mothers and an unnecessary antagonism between the sexes. She herself seems to have lived an unconventional married life; she spent more time with Maitland than with her husband and daughter, although there is no indication that Algernon stood in the way of his wife's activities. She divided her time, with Maitland in tow, between London, the continent, and Atcham, and was plagued by extreme ill health and pain which was relieved by increasingly liberal doses of chloroform and morphine. Kingsford died in Maitland's arms from consumption at 15 Wynnstay Gardens, Kensington, London, on 22 February 1888. Algernon was not present. She was buried at Atcham a week later.<br>
