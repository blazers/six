<span class="headword">Conquest <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Oliver]</span>,  George Augustus</span>  (1837&#150;1901), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born at a house adjoining the old Garrick Theatre, Leman Street, Goodman's Fields, London, on 8 May 1837. He was the eldest son of Benjamin Oliver (1805&#150;1872), an actor and theatre manager, and his wife, Clarissa Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett, a dancer and ballet mistress. Benjamin Oliver, who used professionally the surname Conquest (which George adopted formally by deed poll in 1883), was manager of the Garrick Theatre, where in 1837, as a child in arms, George made his first appearance on the stage, in the farce <span class="italic">Mr and Mrs White</span>. He played there, while a child, in such pieces as <span class="italic">Peter the Waggoner</span>, <span class="italic">Isabella, or, The Fatal Marriage</span>, and <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>. He was educated at the <i>coll&egrave;ge communal</i>, Boulogne, where he was a contemporary of the eminent French actor Beno&icirc;t Coquelin, and learned to speak fluent French. He was intended to be a violinist, but from his earliest years he resolved on the profession of acrobatic pantomimist. Before he left school he made numerous adaptations from the French for his father, who in 1851 became manager of the Grecian Theatre in City Road. His first play, <span class="italic">Woman's Secret, or, Richelieu's Wager</span>, was produced at the Grecian on 17 October 1853.<br>
<br>At Christmas 1855 Conquest appeared as a pantomimist for the first time, in his own pantomime <span class="italic">Harlequin Sun, Moon, and the Seven Sisters</span>, and at Easter 1857 he made his first notable success in this class of work as Hassarac, in Henry Spry's <span class="italic">The Forty Thieves</span>. In the same year he married Elizabeth Ozmond, and at Christmas he appeared as Pastrano Nonsuch, a &#145;flying pantomimist&#146;, in <span class="italic">Peter Wilkins and the Flying Indians</span>, which he wrote in collaboration with Spry. Conquest later effectively adapted Charles Reade's novel <span class="italic">It is Never too Late to Mend</span>, which ran for six months at his father's theatre, and in which he appeared as Peter Crawley. In 1861 he distinguished himself as Prince Pigmy in <span class="italic">The Blue Bird in Paradise</span>.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1872 Conquest became manager of the Grecian and continued to fill leading parts there. In 1881 he joined Paul Merritt as co-lessee and manager of the Surrey Theatre, of which he was sole lessee and manager from 1885. His only appearances in the West End of London were at the Gaiety Theatre, in 1873, in <span class="italic">Snaefell</span>, and at the Globe, in 1882, in <span class="italic">Mankind</span>, where he showed his melodramatic power to good effect in the part of Daniel Groodge. Off the stage, he suffered from an impediment of speech, which disappeared when he was acting. He visited America in 1880, and opened his tour with <span class="italic">The Grim Goblin</span> at Wallack's Theatre, New York, on 5 August. While performing there in <span class="italic">Flying Fairy and Phantom Flight</span> he sustained severe injuries through the breaking of trapeze ropes, caused, it was stated, through the treachery of a rival.<br>
<br>Conquest was best known as an acrobatic pantomimist. He produced no fewer than forty-five pantomimes, and played in as many as twenty-seven. He impersonated animals with much popular approval, his most famous part being that of Zacky Pastrana, the man-monkey, in <span class="italic">For Ever</span>. He is said to have invented the method of &#145;flying&#146; by means of &#145;invisible&#146; wires. It was his boast that as a pantomimist he had broken every bone in his face and body. In his performance of the title role in <span class="italic">The Devil on Two Sticks</span> he employed no fewer than twenty-nine &#145;traps&#146;&#151;one &#145;vampire&#146; and twenty-eight ordinary. He retired from the stage in 1894, but his three sons, George, Fred, and Arthur, all successfully adopted their father's calling, both as actors and acrobatic pantomimists.<br>
<br>Of the hundred and more plays, for the most part original melodramas or adaptations from the French, of which Conquest was the author, several were written in collaboration, and of these the more successful were <span class="italic">Velvet and Rags</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Mankind</span> (1881), and <span class="italic">For Ever</span> (1882), written with Merritt, and <span class="italic">Sentenced to Death</span> (1875), <span class="italic">Queen's Evidence</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">The Green Lanes of England</span> (1878), written with Henry Pettitt. His last play, <span class="italic">The Fighting Fifth</span>, written with Herbert Leonard, was produced at the Surrey Theatre in October 1900.<br>
<br>Conquest died from heart disease at his home, &#145;Hillsboro&#146;, 49 Brixton Hill, London, on 14 May 1901, leaving a fortune of over &pound;70,000, and was buried at Norwood cemetery on 17 May.<br>
