<span class="headword">Sunderland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sykes]</span>,  Susan</span>  (1819&#150;1905), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 30 April 1819 at Spring Gardens, Slead Syke, Brighouse, Yorkshire, the daughter of James Sykes (1782&#150;1846), a gardener, and his wife, Hannah (1785&#150;1855). After her marriage to Henry Sunderland (1817&#150;1893), a Brighouse butcher and farmer, on 7 June 1838, she moved to the nearby Spring Terrace (later 24 Waterloo Road), Waring Green, Brighouse, which remained her home for the rest of her life. Notwithstanding her humble social background, her early employment in a textile mill, her lack of a formal musical education, and her domestic responsibilities as a wife and mother of six children, she emerged from the distinctive West Riding tradition of choral music to become an accomplished singer of oratorio and popular songs during the period 1834&#150;64 in both London and the provinces. However, she neither sought nor achieved the international celebrity status of her contemporaries Clara Novello, Jenny Lind, and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Tietjens, who judged Susan Sunderland's voice to be the finest English voice she had heard.<br>
<br>Susan Sunderland received her earliest musical training from Luke Settle, a Brighouse blacksmith and later choirmaster of Brighouse parish church, who discovered her talents by accident in 1831; John Denham, choirmaster of the Bridge End Independent Chapel, Rastrick; and Daniel Sugden, who was associated with both the Halifax Choral Society and the Halifax Sunday School Jubilee Sings. She made her d&eacute;but at Deighton, an industrial hamlet near Huddersfield, in 1834, became a founder member of the Huddersfield Choral Society in 1836, and sang with the Halifax Choral Society, the Yorkshire Choral Union, and church and chapel choirs in Brighouse, Huddersfield, Rastrick, Southowram. She attracted the attention of royalty, earning the compliments of the prince consort and the duke of Cambridge at her London d&eacute;but at the Antient Concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms in 1842, and of Queen Victoria (who had reputedly been moved by her rendering of the national anthem at the opening of Leeds town hall in September 1858) at private performances at Buckingham Palace. Following a performance with the Sacred Harmonic Society at the Exeter Hall in December 1858, the <span class="italic">Times</span> critic maintained that, with the exception of Clara Novello, there was no contemporary English singer able to render the soprano music of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> &#145;so impressively&#146;.<br>
<br>Invariably simply attired for concert performance in black silk or satin enhanced with a small coral brooch, Sunderland was endowed with an imposing stature and prodigious stamina, frequently walking miles to attend her Yorkshire engagements. Critics admired the flexibility of her voice, her moving interpretation of Handel's &#145;I know that my redeemer liveth&#146;, and her repertory of popular songs, including &#145;Home, sweet home&#146;. Her appeal evidently transcended social barriers. She sang at the annual soir&eacute;es of the Brighouse Mechanics' Institute and participated in glee evenings in taverns and public houses in the county of her birth, where she was known affectionately as the Calderdale Nightingale and the Yorkshire Queen of Song, and where tickets for her concerts were evidently raffled in the mills. At her farewell concert in Huddersfield in 1864, crowds unable to gain admission to the Philosophical Hall listened outside open windows in the street below. Large crowds later assembled at Brighouse town hall for her golden wedding celebration in 1888, when she was presented with an illuminated address and inscribed silver casket. Additional subscriptions collected on this occasion funded the establishment of the Mrs Sunderland Music Festival, which has been held annually in Huddersfield since 1889 (except in 1940).<br>
<br>After retiring at the height of her popularity at the age of forty-five, Sunderland taught privately. Widowed in 1893, she died aged eighty-six on 7 May 1905 and was buried on the 10th in Brighouse cemetery, where huge crowds, many of whom would have been too young to have heard her sing, assembled to witness the surviving members of her family (three of her children had predeceased her), local dignitaries, and the musical fraternity of Yorkshire paying their last respects to one of the county's most distinguished vocalists.<br>
