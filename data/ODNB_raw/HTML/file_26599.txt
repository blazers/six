<span class="headword">Story,  Robert</span>  (1790&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 3 March 1790 at Yetholm, Roxburghshire, where his father, George Story, was parish schoolmaster. His mother, Margaret Herbert, came from a Northumbrian family. After receiving elementary education at home he entered Edinburgh University in 1805, where he associated with the poet Thomas Pringle (1789&#150;1834), the son of a neighbouring farmer; with Pringle he published a poetic satire of the Edinburgh Philomathic Society, <span class="italic">The Institute</span>, in 1811. Story was a good student, earning distinction in the debating societies as well as in his studies. From July 1811 to the beginning of 1815 he was tutor in several families, preparing at the same time for ordination in the Church of Scotland. One of his tutorial posts was in the family of Lord Dalhousie, his youngest pupil being James Andrew Broun Ramsay (1812&#150;1860), later governor-general of India, whose friendship he enjoyed through life. Licensed as a preacher in July 1815, Story was appointed assistant at Rosneath, Dunbartonshire, in December. In 1817 Thomas Carlyle, on a walking tour with a mutual friend, stayed with him for several days; Carlyle recalled the visit vividly in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1881). Ordained minister of the parish of Rosneath on 26 March 1818, Story was introduced to his congregation by Thomas Chalmers. On 15 September 1828 he married Helen Boyle (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter of Mr Dunlop of Keppoch, Dunbartonshire. They had four children.<br>
<br>Story devoted himself mainly to his professional work and the improvement of a somewhat demoralized parish. In 1831 he stoutly defended his friend and neighbour, John McLeod Campbell of Row, who was deposed by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland for his views on the atonement. Story escaped deposition himself because he did not agree with Campbell's formulation of &#145;universal pardon&#146;. Story was involved in another religious controversy in the early 1830s which led to the foundation of the Catholic Apostolic church. In 1829 he had published a moving memoir of a parishioner, Isabella Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1827), entitled <span class="italic">Peace in Believing</span>. In 1830 her sister, Mary Campbell, professed to have received the gift of tongues, and, though Story soon came to view her as deluded, she found disciples in London. The authenticity of her gift was accepted by Edward Irving, who was soon afterwards expelled from his own church for his advocacy of spiritual gifts.<br>
<br>Story remained in the Church of Scotland after the Disruption of 1843, and in 1853 saw a new parish church erected and a supplementary church built on the southern border of his parish&#151;the expenses largely defrayed through his own exertions&#151;to meet the needs of a young community when Lochlongside was granted out in fee. After a period of ill health Story died on 22 November 1859 at Rosneath, and was buried in the churchyard there. A monument to his memory, from a design by the sculptor William Brodie, was placed on the wall of the chancel in the parish church. Story was survived by his wife and two of their children. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36327/', "Robert Herbert Story")</script> succeeded his father as minister of Rosneath and later became principal of Glasgow University.<br>
