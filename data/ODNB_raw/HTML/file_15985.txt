<span class="headword">Landseer,  Jessica</span>  (1807&#150;1880), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, was born at 71 Queen Anne Street East (later 33 Foley Street), London, one of the fourteen children (of whom seven survived infancy) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15986/', "John Landseer (1762/3&#150;1852)")</script>, painter, engraver, and author, and his wife, Jane Potts (1773/4&#150;1840). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15984/', "Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1802&#150;1873)")</script>, the famous animal painter, was her brother. She received an art education at home from her father and first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1816, at the precocious age of nine. She was represented by a total of forty-seven works at the Royal Academy (1816&#150;66), the British Institution (1817&#150;23), the Old Watercolour Society (1817&#150;20), the Society of British Artists (1832&#150;7), and the Liverpool Academy (1838). The majority of her early contributions were landscapes, often of scenes in Essex and Suffolk. In the 1820s she also etched plates of her brother Edwin's work, including one of a Scottish terrier, <span class="italic">Vixen</span>, and another, <span class="italic">Lady Louisa Russell Feeding a Donkey</span>, in 1826. In the 1830s her subject matter broadened: she exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy, including <span class="italic">Portrait of a Student of the Royal Academy</span> in 1835, while to the Society of British Artists she sent figure subjects and three watercolour copies of her brother's paintings of people and animals.<br>
<br>A couple of years after the death of their mother in 1840, Jessica Landseer went to live with her brother Edwin, who had remained a bachelor, at 1 St John's Wood Road, London, where their aunt, Barbara Potts, kept house for him. Jessica gradually took over household responsibilities and by the 1850s her brother was paying her more than &pound;200 a year. She cared for him through the years of his greatest acclaim and success, during which he was frequently subject to illness and depression, until his death in 1873. Algernon Graves described Jessica Landseer as &#145;a meek, amiable little body who looked after her brother's house in a very quiet and unostentatious way&#146;  (Lennie, 165).<br>
<br>Jessica Landseer did not exhibit between 1839 and 1862, and it has been suggested that she was prevented from doing so by Edwin's disapproval of professional women artists, as well as by her considerable domestic duties. Evidence that she continued to work, however, is provided by three extant works: a miniature of 1844 (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) from a sketch of Mrs Bradshaw by Edwin Landseer; a watercolour copy in miniature, dated 1845 (Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh), of her brother's portrait of Sir Walter Scott; and her own engraving of 1858 (British Museum, London) from her portrait of her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15987/', "Thomas Landseer (1793/4&#150;1880)")</script>. In 1863 she resumed exhibiting at the Royal Academy, showing that year a painting of Edwin Landseer's dog, Lassie, and a final contribution, <span class="italic">A Recollection</span>, in 1866. Otherwise, from 1865 until her death in 1880 she was represented exclusively at the Society of Female Artists, of which she was for the same period an honorary member; her exhibits included landscapes, animals, portraits, and two copies, in miniature, of paintings by Edwin Landseer, one of which, <span class="italic">Beauty's Bath</span> (a portrait of Miss Eliza Peel with her dog, Fido), became the property of Queen Alexandra, consort of Edward VII. Edwin Landseer left his sister a substantial legacy and by 1877 she had moved to 6 Kensington Park Gardens, London, where she kept a carriage. She died, unmarried, at Folkestone, Kent, on 29 August 1880.<br>
