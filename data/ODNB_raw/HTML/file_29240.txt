<span class="headword">White,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1711), <span class="occ">chocolate-house keeper</span>, was an Italian immigrant; in his will he left legacies to his sister and her husband, Angela Maria and Tomaso Casanova, and to his aunt Nicoletta Tomasi, all of Genoa. His name, it has been presumed, may well have been a straight translation from the Italian: Francesco Bianco or Bianchi, perhaps. It has not been possible to trace White in the records of naturalization and denization.<br>
<br>White was the original proprietor of White's Chocolate House, which he set up in a house on the east side of St James's Street, Westminster. In 1697 White moved premises to a higher-rental building on the west side of St James's Street, later no. 69, where it remained until a fire destroyed the premises in 1733. In 1702 White leased an adjoining house to the north of his chocolate house, and soon after he employed the services of John Arthur to assist and later manage the business.<br>
<br>From its inception, White's became associated with both whig politics and &eacute;lite fashionability. The chocolate house cultivated an air of greater distinction than did the much more demotic coffee houses. The charge for entrance at White's was 6<i>d</i>., while the charge at most coffee houses was only 1<i>d</i>. White's catered to the social rounds of London's male leisured class, although the discourse which took place there was not entirely devoted to the light-hearted matters of &#145;gallantry and pleasure&#146; which Richard Steele thought most characteristic of the place and which William Congreve epitomized in 1700 in the first act of <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>  (<span class="italic">Tatler</span>, 1, 12 April 1709, ed. Bond, 1.16). It was at White's Chocolate House that James Brydges, the future duke of Chandos and paymaster-general of the army, engaged in debates concerning the popular origins of government; he also discussed more topical matters, such as, in the 1690s, the prospects for a peace and the question of the Spanish succession. Brydges polished his virtuoso credentials there by discussing the contents of the earl of Sunderland's library with Lord Derwentwater and the son of John Lake, the nonjuring bishop of Chichester  (Brydges's journal).<br>
<br>But it was gambling and gaming for which White's was both famous and notorious. Neither the whiggish flavour of its company nor its fashionability endeared White's to tory-inclined critics such as Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, who, according to Jonathan Swift, &#145;never passed by White's Chocolate-House (the common rendez-vous of infamous sharpers, and noble cullies) without bestowing a curse upon that famous academy, as the bane of half the English nobility&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Writings of Jonathan Swift</span>, 12.50). Swift himself occasionally visited White's, although he complained of finding there &#145;drunken whiggish lords like &hellip; Lord Santry who come into the chocolate house and rail aloud at the Tories, and have challenges sent them, and the next morning come and beg pardon&#146;  (Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, 485).<br>
<br>At the time that he made his will in 1708, in which he left legacies worth &pound;2500, White had a wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1729?), and four children, all minors. White died in February 1711 and was buried in St James's, Piccadilly. His widow continued to run the chocolate house after her husband's death, and began to promote the sales of tickets to operas, masquerades, and ridottos. She remarried, her next husband being Major George Skene (or Skreen) of Chelsea, who died in 1724; she probably died in 1729. Soon thereafter, the property passed out of the hands of the White family and the business was taken over by White's longtime servant, John Arthur, and his son, Robert  (Lillywhite, 640&#150;41). By this point, the society at White's had grown even more exclusive and was dominated by its famous club, the first list of rules and members for which date from 1736, making it the West End club with the longest continuous history. In 1755 Robert Arthur purchased a freehold for the great house in St James's Street, to which White's Club was relocated, and the chocolate house was finally closed.<br>
