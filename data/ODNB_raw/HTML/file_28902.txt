<span class="headword">Walton <span class="st"> [Wauton]</span>,  Simon  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1265/6), <span class="occ">justice and bishop of Norwich</span>, was probably a native of Walton d'Eiville, Warwickshire. In 1235&#150;6 Master Simon of Walton appears as a plaintiff concerning lands in nearby Tysoe. A trained canon lawyer, his services brought him a pension from Osney Abbey, and he was also employed by the king, from whom he began to receive gifts. In 1242 he was made keeper of the vacant see of Lichfield, and in 1245 he was involved in much administrative work in connection with Henry III's Welsh campaign.<br>
<br>Walton began a career as an itinerant justice in the midlands and west of England in January 1246, the year in which he received the farm of the royal manor of Feckenham, Worcestershire. Later the king gave him deer for his park of Stock Bradley in the royal forest near Feckenham. From the prior and convent of Worcester, where a Robert of Walton, possibly his brother, was chamberlain, he received in 1253 the rectory of Stoke Prior, Herefordshire, and in 1254 the lease of the manor of Harvington, Worcestershire. The acquisition of property accompanied his rise as a justice. He was the effective leader on one of the two circuits of the eyre in 1254&#150;6, at the end of which he returned as chief justice to the bench of common pleas, on which he had sat for the first time in Michaelmas term 1251. In March 1254 he was allowed the temporary use of the bishop of Carlisle's London house. Finally, in June 1257 he was elected to the bishopric of Norwich, receiving the temporalities of the see on favourable terms.<br>
<br>Walton remained conspicuously loyal to the king throughout the years of baronial reform and rebellion. In 1259 he was employed in negotiations with the king of France and to adjudicate upon breaches of the truce with the Welsh; and in 1260 he was one of the commission of bishops proposed to settle the private disputes between Simon de Montfort and the king. His ultimate offence in the eyes of the baronial party was his appointment in 1261, along with Boniface, archbishop of Canterbury, and John Mansel, to execute the papal bulls which Henry had procured, enjoining the barons to obey the king and absolving them from their oaths of allegiance to the provisions of Oxford. In 1263 he was forced to flee from his cathedral to the abbey of Bury St Edmunds, a secure refuge since its liberty &#145;was exceedingly precious in the eyes of the barons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Bury St Edmunds</span>, 27). The &#145;Song of the Barons&#146; called Walton &#145;the good shepherd of Norwich, who devours the sheep&#146;, and cursed anyone &#145;who left a mite to him, for he knew much about shame&#146;  (Aspin, 19&#150;20). The baronial <i>custos pacis</i> for Norfolk was ordered to confiscate his lands, but these were restored to him when he took an oath to support the provisions. He was one of the prelates summoned to London for Simon de Montfort's parliament in January 1265. He did not long enjoy the king's triumph over his enemies in August of that year, for he died &#145;about the feast of the Circumcision&#146; (1 January), 1266, &#145;in good old age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 4. 183). He was buried in Norwich Cathedral; on 18 January the king granted the guardians of the vacant diocese of Norwich the administration of his will. A John of Walton held lands at Bradley, Worcestershire, in 1274&#150;5.<br>
