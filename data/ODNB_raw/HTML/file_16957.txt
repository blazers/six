<span class="headword">London,  John</span>  (1485/6&#150;1543), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was a native of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, the son of an Oxfordshire tenant farmer. In 1497, at the age of eleven, he was admitted a scholar of Winchester College, proceeding thence in 1503 as a scholar of New College, Oxford, where he was elected a full fellow in 1505. He graduated BCL in 1513, proceeded DCL in 1519, and was elected principal of Hinksey Hall in 1513. In 1526 he was elected warden of New College, a post he retained until 1542, while by 1533 he had been made a notary public by apostolic and imperial authority. Although he was not ordained priest until 1522, in April 1519 he became a canon of York Minster, holding the prebend of Bilton. He came to hold a number of other preferments, including a series of prebends in Lincoln Cathedral, and became a canon and prebendary at both Salisbury and Windsor in 1540. Appointed dean of Wallingford in 1536, and master of St John's Hospital there in 1541, on 1 September 1542 he was made dean of the new cathedral at Oxford, which was then in the former abbey of Osney.<br>
<br>Although London played an active role in the persecution of Lutherans in Oxford, both at his own college and at King Henry VIII College, his reputation as a bloodthirsty persecutor of heretics owes much to the highly coloured account of his actions provided by John Foxe in the <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>. Certainly one member of New College, John Quinby, was in 1528 imprisoned in the steeple on London's orders, and died in captivity. When London's own nephew, Edward London, was heard to argue that papal supremacy had no legitimate foundation, his uncle summoned him and spent five hours trying to persuade him to disavow his opinions. Foxe claimed that London rejoiced in the arrest of Thomas Garrard (or Garrett) in 1540, and listed him among the &#145;pharisees troubled at Garrett's escape out of prison&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5.424). London's reputation as a defender of Catholic orthodoxy places him low in Foxe's estimation: the martyrologist describes London as &#145;puffing, blustering, and blowing, like a hungry and greedy lion seeking his prey&#146;. However, it is clear from correspondence between London and John Longland, bishop of Lincoln, that London was following the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey in his actions against Garrard in 1528, and that he preferred that the case should receive &#145;gentle and discreet treatment&#146;  (ibid., 5, appx). Despite Foxe's interpretation of London's interview with his nephew, it was London who was to find himself forced to justify his conservative opinions after Edward had reported them to the council in 1536.<br>
<br>It is for his participation in the campaign for the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s that London is best remembered. He was responsible for the dissolution of houses in Oxford, Reading, Warwickshire, and Northamptonshire, and a number of letters between London, Cromwell, and Rich survive, many detailing the suppression of houses and the removal of images. David Knowles refers to him as a &#145;legendary figure&#146; in the history of the period, while stopping short of Philip Hughes's description of London as &#145;one of the vilest men of all this vile time&#146;  (Hughes, 1.235). Although frequently regarded as a colleague of Layton, Legh, and ap Rice from the start of the process of visitation, London was not in fact active in the suppression of religious houses until 1538, and in many ways he was a strange choice as visitor: he had not been employed by the government prior to the dissolution, and played no role in the process of the official Henrician Reformation after this date. Earlier histories of the dissolution portray London as an enthusiastic destroyer and spoiler of the monasteries, removing everything of value and destroying what he could not remove. But more recently he has been viewed as a moderate and considerate agent of government, never making sweeping generalizations over the moral character of the monks, and making a deliberate effort to obtain financial security for those affected, for instance requesting favourable treatment for the abbess of Godstow. His own religious opinions were very much those of the conservative wing of the Henrician church; Knowles describes his motivation as an urge to reform rather than suppress, and there is little to suggest that he had any doctrinal interest in the obliteration of monasticism.<br>
<br>Despite London's role in the dissolution, his relations with Thomas Cromwell were not always amicable. He has been criticized for his &#145;oleagenous subservience to his political masters, especially to Thomas Cromwell&#146;  (Buxton and Williams, 45), but there were good reasons for his repeated protestations of loyalty to the Henrician cause. In 1532 it was suggested that his conservatism was standing in the way of his commitment to the crown: London responded by assuring Cromwell that all rumours of his opposition to royal policy were false, and claiming that he had publicly consented to Henry VIII's divorce before the whole university. London invoked the assistance of Cromwell in the government of his college, protesting against the demands of his fellows, but his defence of papal authority at this time made his position less secure. In 1533 his position was under threat again after one Richard Jones, arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London after involvement in alchemy and prophecy, promised that he would reveal things about London &#145;that would make him smoke and others too of his affinity&#146;  (Elton, 56). In July 1536 London felt compelled to write to Cromwell once again with a declaration of his loyalty to the crown, and denying rumours that he had spoken openly in favour of purgatory, pilgrimages, and the papal supremacy.<br>
<br>London clearly feared that his position at New College was under threat: in a letter to Cromwell the latter's agent Thomas Bedyll outlined London's concerns and claimed that he was a dedicated servant of the crown. London enlisted the support of Bedyll again in 1537, protesting that Cromwell believed him to be a papist, and complaining again that he was troubled by the fellows of New College. The main causes of the clash with the fellows appear to have been his refusal to manumit bondsmen to college estates, and more particularly his hostility towards Lutheranism and the new learning. He had reported difficulties in maintaining discipline among the college membership, which included such conservatives as John and Nicholas Harpsfield alongside early evangelicals, John Man and John Philpot. His problems may indeed have been heightened by a clash between his obligation to enforce the will of the crown and his determination to suppress all heresy and innovation. London was clearly not the only conservative in New College, but his enemies were all too aware that any hint of opposition to the Henrician Reformation could be used against him.<br>
<br>With the fall of Cromwell in 1540 London aligned himself more firmly with Stephen Gardiner and the conservative members of the Henrician court and church. Having become a canon of Windsor he played an active role in the persecution of heterodoxy there. John Foxe lists him among the persecutors of the group of Windsor evangelicals in the spring of 1543, and at the same time he also played an important role in the conspiracy against Thomas Cranmer and the evangelicals at court, which culminated in the so-called prebendaries' plot. It was London who brought Stephen Gardiner into the orbit of the plotters, thereby forging a powerful alliance of conservative interests based in Kent, Oxford, and Winchester. In March 1543 London brought evidence of heresy in Windsor before the privy council, apparently with the prior knowledge of Gardiner. London and his ally William Symonds alleged that Anthony Peerson and his circle were acting in violation of the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> of 1539, which had set out official belief on a number of matters, most notably clerical marriage and the eucharist. Gardiner instructed London to return to Windsor to search for more concrete information, information that might be enough to tip the balance at court, and the mind of the king, in favour of the conservatives. London had an important part to play in the questioning of the suspects. The persecution of heresy in Windsor reached a peak in 1543, when it was believed that revealing the extent of heterodox belief there and in Kent would prove to be a decisive blow against the reformers, implicating Thomas Cranmer in the spread of evangelical beliefs in Kent and causing the king to turn against the archbishop.<br>
<br>Peerson and two of his followers were burnt on 28 July, but in November the king chose to stand by Cranmer, and John London was one of the first casualties. This may have been no accident: there are suggestions that London admitted full responsibility for the events, and particularly the questioning of members of the privy council, in an effort to preserve Gardiner's position. Accused of committing perjury in an attempt to exonerate himself after the Windsor trials, he was convicted and sentenced to ride through Windsor, Reading, and Newbury facing the tail of his horse with a paper on his head, before being committed to the Fleet. He had died in prison before the end of the year. News of his death was welcomed by contemporary evangelical writers, including John Bale, who recorded the event in the <span class="italic">Epistle Exhortatorye of an Englyshe Christiane</span> (1544; ESTC 1291; fol. 9<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). The nature of London's involvement in the affairs of church and state has done much to shape his posthumous reputation&#151;Catholic commentators and historians have condemned him for his involvement in the material destruction of the early Reformation, while protestant writers have criticized his continued conservatism and apparent allegiance to Rome.<br>
