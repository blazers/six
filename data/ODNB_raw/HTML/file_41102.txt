<span class="headword">Pitter,  Ruth</span>  (1897&#150;1992), <span class="occ">poet and craftswoman</span>, was born on 7 November 1897 at 1 Meath Road, Ilford, Essex, the eldest of three children of George Pitter (1862&#150;1926) and his wife, Louisa Rosetta (Rosamund), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murrell (1869&#150;1941), both assistant teachers in the East End of London. Though she grew up in poor surroundings her childhood was transfigured by the discovery of Hainault Forest, for her unforgettably magical.<br>
<br>In 1911, while still at the Coborn School, Bow, and with her parents' encouragement, Pitter began contributing regularly to A. R. Orage's periodical <span class="italic">New Age</span>. After two years in the War Office, she joined a small firm at Southwold on the Suffolk coast, making decorated furniture and other wares. When her employers moved to London in 1918 she continued with them until in 1930, with a fellow worker who became her lifelong companion, Kathleen O'Hara (known as K), she acquired the &#145;ghost of a similar business&#146; in Chelsea  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 1110). The partnership prospered, marketing trays and other objects delicately painted, mainly by Pitter, with garlands of flowers and fruit.<br>
<br>Hilaire Belloc discovered Pitter's work through Orage, and financed her earliest publications, <span class="italic">First Poems</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">First and Second Poems</span> (1927). Although Pitter tended later to dismiss these works they contain many clues to her future development: she was convinced of the special nature and privilege of the poet's craft, aware that for her it was incompatible with marriage. In autumn 1927 she befriended Eric Blair (George Orwell), and was later to count him with Orage, Belloc, and Lord David Cecil as among the most important influences of her life.<br>
<br>Pitter's long poem <span class="italic">Persephone in Hades</span> (1931) appeared in a tiny limited edition printed in France, but she first attracted public attention with <span class="italic">A Mad Lady's Garland</span> (1934), a brilliantly crafted work reflecting her early exercises, encouraged by Orage, in the art of pastiche. John Stewart Collis remembered &#145;Her remarkable <i>range</i>, and the subtlety of her oblique lyrical assault&#146;. When Orage and George William Russell (AE) met with contributors at a caf&eacute; in Chancery Lane, Pitter &#145;far surpassed [AE], or anyone else, in conversation, her talk having in it so much of surprise and freshness&#146;  (Collis, 125). Pitter received increasing acclaim with <span class="italic">A Trophy of Arms</span> (1936), with a preface by James Stephens, which won her the Hawthornden prize, and <span class="italic">The Spirit Watches</span> (1939). During the Second World War she and K abandoned their business to work in Morgan's Crucible Works across the Thames, an experience which gave rise to some of Pitter's most moving poems in <span class="italic">The Bridge</span> (1945).<br>
<br>During these grim years, inspired by the broadcasts and writings of C. S. Lewis, Pitter joined the Anglican church. Her new faith intensified tendencies already manifest in her verse, which was grounded in the natural world, in common things and people, portrayed with love and a painterly exactness of vision. She celebrated a belief in an all-pervading divinity in creation, investing with visionary force the hoverfly on the anthers of a poppy as much as the constellations. Her poems ranged from profound desolation to a triumphant affirmation of renewed life, exemplified in the myth of Persephone, her aim always to capture the &#145;hints and echoes and messages of which everything is full&#146;  (Pitter, <span class="italic">Poems, 1926&#150;1966</span>, 1968, xi). There was a lighter side to her, however, perceptible throughout her work&#151;a relish for earthy humour and demotic speech, captured in <span class="italic">The Rude Potato</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">Pitter on Cats</span> (1947).<br>
<br>After 1945 Pitter continued her decorative painting at home, and did so into her seventies. <span class="italic">Urania</span> (1950) collected some of her best poems from <span class="italic">A Trophy of Arms</span> onwards, followed by <span class="italic">The Ermine: Poems, 1942&#150;1952</span>, not long after she and K had moved to Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire, where she could indulge her love of gardening. In 1954 she won the Heinemann Foundation award, and in 1955 was the first woman to receive the queen's gold medal for poetry. She gained a reputation on radio and television, notably as a member of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>, and from 1958 to 1959 contributed weekly articles to <span class="italic">Woman</span> magazine on country living, gardening, and religious feeling. The then editor, Mary Grieve, recalled her later as &#145;physically very strong, with a strong voice, slow in her movements but with a lot of stamina, a very practical person&#146;  (unpublished interview, 17 Sept 1990).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Still by Choice</span>, a Poetry Book Society recommendation, appeared in 1966, and in 1968 <span class="italic">Poems, 1926&#150;1966</span>, with an American edition, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, in 1969, but these years had seen a loss of impetus. Already in a broadcast interview in 1964 Pitter had spoken of feeling &#145;rather suspended, like Mahomet's coffin&#146;, and in 1973 K died, but by 1975 there were further poems to appear in <span class="italic">End of Drought</span>. Pitter had been honoured as a companion of literature in 1974, and in 1979 was made a commander of the British empire. In 1987, in her ninetieth year, the Enitharmon Press published <span class="italic">A Heaven to Find</span>, spanning the years 1908 to 1976, and in 1990 produced an invaluable new <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, revised and re-issued in 1996.<br>
<br>In her last years Pitter was blind and confined to her couch at home, but despite her frailty her face and voice were still strong, her conversation spellbindingly rich and humorous. She died at her home, The Hawthorns, Chilton Road, Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, on 29 February 1992 and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Long Crendon, on 5 March 1992.<br>
