<span class="headword">Iredell,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1739), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian General Synod of Ulster and author</span>, was born in co. Antrim, Ireland, and educated at a philosophical and theological school run in Antrim by the Revd Thomas Gowan. He was licensed by the Antrim meeting on 4 March 1684 and ordained in Donegore on 19 June 1688. That he was held in high esteem by his colleagues is indicated by the fact that in 1689 he was appointed as one of two ministers to present the address of the northern Presbyterians to the duke of Schomberg when he came to Ireland with the army of King William. He was clerk of the General Synod of Ulster from 1692 to 1696. In 1696 he resisted the command of synod to become minister of Armagh, and was rebuked for so doing.<br>
<br>In 1699 the synod compelled Iredell to become minister of the Capel Street congregation in Dublin, and there he remained until his death in 1739. On 22 April 1701 he preached before the societies for the Reformation of Manners in Dublin, taking as his theme national righteousness. This sermon was the first of his works to be published. It was followed in 1705 by a funeral sermon for his talented young colleague the Revd John Milling. On 25 May 1716 he married Eleanor McCartney, daughter of Arthur McCartney of Dublin.<br>
<br>Iredell was appointed moderator of the Synod of Ulster in 1701. Throughout his time in Dublin he continued to represent the cause of Irish Presbyterians in high places. Thus in 1711 the synod entrusted him to lay before the English government its answer to charges against them by the Irish House of Lords. A copy of his private instructions has been preserved, outlining the people to be met, the discretionary powers with which he was entrusted, the arrangements for consultation with leading members of the Synod of Ulster, and instances and explanations that he might employ to advance his arguments or counter those of his opponents. In 1715 he and Colonel Clotworthy Upton met George I to convey the grievances of their colleagues, chiefly regarding the operation of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1704. Although sympathetically received, they failed to secure the promises of relief they sought, but they were successful in obtaining the prompt renewal of the <i>regium donum</i>. In 1728 the lords justices of Ireland were alarmed by the excessive emigration from Ulster and turned to Iredell and his colleague the Revd Robert Craghead (<i>d</i>. 1738) for advice about its cause.<br>
<br>Although fully involved with his Dublin colleagues, Iredell represented an essentially northern presence in a congregation that belonged to the Synod of Ulster. Like them he was orthodox in doctrine. In the subscription controversy of the 1720s, however, he differed from them in being a subscriber by conviction. In 1726 he published <span class="italic">Remarks upon some passages relating to the confession of faith in Rev Mr Samuel Haliday's letter to the Rev Mr Gilbert Kennedy</span>. This produced a printed reply from Haliday, and as a rejoinder Iredell published in 1727 <span class="italic">A letter to the Rev Mr. Samuel Haliday, wherein the remarks upon some passages in his letter to the Rev Mr Gilbert Kennedy are defended</span>. In his writings he argued cogently that the Westminster confession in its teaching regarding the person of Christ was at one with classical defences of orthodoxy. Against the charge of Haliday that the Westminster confession made a merely scholastic point the ground of ministerial communion, he argued that the confession faithfully expressed the teaching of the church in its historic creeds and councils that Christ possessed a divine nature from all eternity, but assumed a human nature, and that these two distinct natures were inseparably joined in one person, the word made flesh. Such statements were valuable and necessary safeguards against doctrinal error, including most notably the Nestorian and Eutychean heresies. Iredell also contended that the imposition of subscription was a legitimate way for church courts to suppress error and preserve truth.<br>
<br>Iredell was a reluctant controversialist, and generous to his opponents. Yet he could not remain silent when he felt truth was at stake. Both in his preaching, which was simple and direct, and in his writing he gave ample evidence of clear thinking and careful scholarship. His increasing disenchantment with the northern non-subscribers and with those who sympathized with them in the south indicated his growing unease at the direction in which he perceived those opposed to subscription to be heading. He died in Dublin on 31 January 1739. He was survived by two sons, Francis, a merchant in Bristol, and Thomas, a barrister and president of the council of Jamaica, where he owned considerable estates.<br>
