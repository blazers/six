<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kippis,  Andrew</span>  (1725&#150;1795), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and biographer</span>, was born in Nottingham on 28 March 1725, the second son of Robert Kippis (<i>c</i>.1698&#150;1730), silk hosier of the city, and his wife, Anne Ryther. His parents were loyal dissenters of Calvinist background, his mother being the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24429/', "John Ryther (1631x5&#150;1681)")</script>, the ejected vicar of Frodingham, Lincolnshire. Following the death of his father Kippis was placed in the care of his paternal grandfather, Andrew Kippis, at Sleaford, Lincolnshire, where his early education took place. Living in a dissenting environment he was encouraged to prepare for the ministry. He had already given up the Calvinism in which he had been instructed: &#145;The agent employed in effecting this important change was the <span class="italic">Treatise on God's Law</span> by Elisha Coles&#146;, Kippis wrote later; &#145;it was put into my hands when 13 or 14 by some zealous friends, to instruct and confirm me in the doctrine it contained. The reading of it, however produced the contrary effect&#146;  (Wilson, 4.105).<br>
<br>Kippis entered Philip Doddridge's academy at Northampton in 1741, and after five years' study he was appointed pastor of an Independent congregation at Sleaford in September 1746.<blockquote>In his youth he was an assiduous student &hellip; he once read for three years at the rate of 16 hours <i>per</i> day; and one of the works &hellip; which he read entirely through, was the <span class="roman">General Dictionary</span>, in 10 volumes; this he added laid the foundation of his taste and skill in biographical composition. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 803)</blockquote>He moved to Dorking, Surrey, in November 1750, in the place of John Mason. Kippis held rather advanced views for many of the dissenters of his day, which arose out of his wide reading; &#145;he was the first of the Dorking ministers to fall into the Arian errors&#146;  (Cleal, 358).<br>
<br>In June 1753 Kippis was appointed minister of the Presbyterian congregation meeting in Princes Street, Westminster, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was a competent speaker, but nothing more than this and not noted for originality. It was the area of his work in which he least excelled, although he was in regular demand as a preacher. On 21 September 1753 he married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1723&#150;1796), daughter of Isaac Bott, a merchant of Boston, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Hannah. All their children died in infancy; &#145;In the early part of their marriage, they lost two sons within a week, the eldest not quite three years&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 913&#150;14).<br>
<br>Kippis built up his early literary reputation by writing for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, in which he took a leading part from its inception. He also wrote extensively for <span class="italic">The Library and Moral and Critical Magazine</span>, which he edited in 1761&#150;2, and for the <span class="italic">New Annual Register</span>. The <span class="italic">History of Ancient Literature</span> and the <span class="italic">Review of Modern Books</span> contained much of his input until 1784. Most of his contributions were historical or theological. His style, while not exciting, was clear and reflected his wide classical, historical, and biographical knowledge; he was constantly with his books at home in Westminster. He also cultivated acquaintanceship with the leading literary figures of his day and became widely known not only among dissenters but also in London intellectual circles. &#145;No man was more cheerful in company than Dr Kippis. He had a strong taste for ridicule, and enjoyed lively and pleasant sallies&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 804).<br>
<br>Kippis was a strong promoter of the dissenting cause and was highly respected as a representative by both the Presbyterians and the Independents. He sat lightly in this denominational divide and did not express controversial theology in public. However, his slow shift in theology and his association with the unitarian position led some Baptists to suspect him; &#145;Robert Hall once said that Kippis laid so many books upon his head that his brains could not move&#146;  (Cleal, 358). In 1763 his orthodoxy was sufficiently respected for him to be appointed to succeed David Jennings as classical tutor at the Coward Trust's Hoxton Academy. He withdrew from this office in 1784, before the dissolution of the academy in the following year. In June 1767 he was made DD of the University of Edinburgh, and was further honoured by being made fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1788 and of the Royal Society in 1779. He subsequently served on the council of both bodies and published a book on the controversies within the Royal Society in 1784.<br>
<br>Kippis helped to organize petitions to parliament aimed at securing the rights of dissenters. He played a large part in the campaign for relief from subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> for dissenting ministers in 1772 and 1773. Bills in each year designed to achieve relief passed the Commons but were rejected by the Lords. He published, in both 1772 and 1773, <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Protestant Dissenting Ministers &hellip; in the Matter of Subscription</span>, which achieved wide circulation. In 1779 a similar bill, which substituted a general declaration of belief in place of subscription, became law. In that year Kippis chaired the committee appointed by the dissenters to agitate for relief. The act was essentially a compromise that, while it completely satisfied no one, strengthened the legal position of dissent generally. He sat on the committees organized by the dissenting deputies to agitate for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> between 1787 and 1790. Early in 1787 he led a deputation of leading dissenters to William Pitt, the prime minister, to press their case. It was of no avail, for it was many years after Kippis's death before the acts were repealed. He was motivated in the parliamentary campaign by his strong affirmation of individual liberty, equal religious rights, and the reform of parliament. However, his belief in reform rather than revolution meant that he took a conservative rather than a radical position; he was no republican and was firmly against insurrection. &#145;The principles of the British Constitution he had diligently studied. To these he was zealously attached; and he ably defended them, though he was not unappraized of the corruption&#146;  (Rees, 40).<br>
<br>In 1786 Kippis was appointed one of the tutors, with Richard Price, Joseph Priestley, and Gilbert Wakefield, at the new dissenting college formed at Hackney; this in many minds confirmed his gradual movement towards unitarianism. He resigned after a few years but continued to give the college his loyal support. Among his pupils were William Godwin and the poet Samuel Rogers, who later recalled his teachers in the first part of <span class="italic">The Pleasures of Memory</span>:<blockquote>
<div>Guides of my life, instructors of my youth,<br>
</div>
<div>Who first unveiled the hallowed form of truth;<br>
</div>
<div>Whose every word enlightened and endeared.<br>
</div> (Clayden, 1.418)</blockquote>Kippis produced several biographies besides his extensive output in magazines. Lives of Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury (1790; republished, 1836), Captain Cook (1778), Philip Doddridge (1792), and Job Orton (1822) are among the most notable. His posthumous fame among Unitarians arose from his joint editorship, with Abraham Rees, Thomas Jervis, and Thomas Morgan, of <span class="italic">A Collection of Hymns and Psalms for Public and Private Worship</span> (1795). This work passed through many editions in the nineteenth century, reaching a ninth edition in 1823, and was known as Kippis's or <span class="roman">Rees's Collection</span>. It was widely used among Presbyterian congregations that became Unitarian, and was in regular use as late as the 1850s; a new, enlarged edition, edited by Edmund Kell, appeared in 1852. &#145;It was the first of the Unitarian books to attain any very extended circulation&#146;  (Julian, 1193). Kippis in his youth wrote poetry, and two of his hymns appear in <span class="italic">A Collection</span>. &#145;Great God, in vain man's narrow view&#146; was widely adopted in later collections and appears in James Martineau's <span class="italic">Hymns</span> (1840 and 1873); &#145;How rich thy gifts, almighty God&#146;, written in 1759, appeared in several collections and parts of it found a place in editions of the <span class="italic">Congregational Hymn Book</span> in 1836 and 1859.<br>
<br>It is for his <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, of which he was editor and prime mover, that Kippis is mainly known. He was recognized, for good or ill, depending on the view of the reader, as the leading biographer of his day. While the <span class="italic">Biographia</span> was partial in coverage and the selection of those included was open to criticism the five volumes that did appear mark a significant development in biographical literature that was built upon in the following century. It was a monumental achievement of scholarship, not only on Kippis's part but also on that of the contributors whom he employed. The first volume appeared in 1778, the second in 1780, the third in 1784, the fourth in 1789, and the fifth in 1793, ending with Fastolf. A few copies of the first part of the sixth volume, ending with Foster, appeared in 1795 but the remainder were lost in a disastrous fire at the printers' office on 8 February 1808, and no other editor was found to complete the work. The entries in the <span class="italic">Biographia</span> are not always consistent in the information that they contain. Kippis often added extensive notes, printed in smaller typeface, to the entries prepared by his contributors. On occasion these notes are longer than the entry itself and do not make for easy reading of the whole. To his credit some of his notes constitute original material that is not to be found elsewhere. It is generally accepted that Kippis was too laudatory in his evaluations but this is probably reflective of the time and of his caution in expressing controversial views. He was one of the few people of sufficient breadth of learning and personal contact with many of his subjects to have prepared the volumes; Dr Johnson was another, but he states that he had declined the task. Kippis's attention to detail meant that he could not complete the <span class="italic">Biographia</span>, and his style is best summarized in a contemporary statement as &#145;without animation yet clear, perspicuous &hellip; and always suited to the subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Protestant Dissenter's Magazine</span>, 1795, 5).<br>
<br>The importance of the <span class="italic">Biographia</span> was clear at the time, and the volumes elicited strong opinions when they appeared. According to James Boswell in the first edition of his <span class="italic">Life of Dr Johnson</span>, Johnson criticized Kippis for including proportionately more dissenting ministers than Anglican clergymen; Boswell withdrew the statement from his next edition. In the period 1776&#150;80 the correspondence between Horace Walpole and the Revd William Cole shows how eagerly members of the intelligentsia waited for the volumes to appear to see what was said about whom. They cannot have been alone in this eagerness. &#145;Shall I beg you to transcribe the passage in which Dr Kippis abuses my father [Sir Robert Walpole] and me, for I shall not buy the new edition, only to purchase abuse on me and mine&#146;  (Walpole to Cole, 10 June 1778, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 90). Cole, writing to Walpole on 1 March 1780, says:<blockquote>I received the volume on February 24 and ran over it as to the new articles and additions by the 27th at night, and have made a perfect book of remarks and censures upon it &hellip; matters of doctrine only I took notice of, which are all tending to what offends my orthodoxy, viz., Arianism, Socinianism, Deism and Independency. (ibid., 196)</blockquote>Kippis was attacked for being partisan, inaccurate, and too laudatory, but most recognized his achievement.<br>
<br>Much of the dispute and the fame came towards the end of Kippis's life. Personally he lamented the decline of the Presbyterian interest and of his own congregation in particular. As a result of his long pastorate of forty-three years his congregation was small. He continued to preach to them to within weeks of his death, on 8 October 1795 at his home in Crown Street, Westminster. &#145;He is said to have had a cough these 30 years and to have often predicted that, when that ceased, he should depart&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 884). He was buried alongside his dissenting friends in Bunhill Fields burial-ground on 15 October, an event followed by possibly the most numerous, lengthy, and laudatory obituaries to appear in the national press and journals for a dissenting minister in the late eighteenth century.<br>
