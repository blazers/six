<span class="headword">Stevenson,  George</span>  (1799&#150;1856), <span class="occ">newspaper editor and proprietor and horticulturalist in Australia</span>, was born at Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland, on 13 April 1799. After the death of his father, a gentleman farmer, in 1811, he went to sea with an uncle who traded in the East Indies, but dissatisfied with this life he began the study of medicine in Scotland. However, in 1820 he left Scotland for Canada, where he worked for some years on his brother's ranch. On the death of his brother he travelled in Central America and the West Indies and contributed travel articles to the London whig newspaper the <span class="italic">Globe and Traveller</span>.<br>
<br>Stevenson returned to England in 1830 and collaborated with Sir William Lytton Earle Bulwer (Lord Dalling) on his book <span class="italic">France, Social, Literary, Political</span> (1834). He obtained employment on the <span class="italic">Globe and Traveller</span> and became joint editor in 1835.<br>
<br>In 1836 Stevenson accepted the position of private secretary to Captain John Hindmarsh, the first governor of South Australia. On 13 May of that year, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, he married Margaret Hutton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gorton, the daughter of John Gorton of Chester, former assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Globe</span>. Before leaving London he entered into partnership with a master printer, Robert Thomas, to produce the first South Australian newspaper, the <span class="italic">South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register</span>. A preliminary issue was published in London on 18 June 1836, and the South Australian publication began on 3 June 1837.<br>
<br>Stevenson travelled to the new colony with Hindmarsh on the <i>Buffalo</i>. He was responsible for the drafting and reading of the proclamation of the colony on 28 December 1836. He was appointed private secretary, clerk of the court, justice of the peace, registrar of shipping, agent for Lloyds, postmaster and customs officer, and interim protector of Aborigines, but continued to edit his newspaper, his outspoken articles often attracting much criticism. In July 1839, following differences with Governor Gawler, he resigned all offices under the crown and was deprived of government printing, but he continued to publish the paper as the <span class="italic">South Australian Register</span> until 1842. Financial difficulties then resulted in bankruptcy proceedings.<br>
<br>For the next three years Stevenson concentrated on horticulture and viticulture, playing a leading part in their development in South Australia. He was most successful at shows and exhibitions. He propagated and sold large numbers of rooted vines and fruit trees, and his North Adelaide garden and orchard were regarded among the best in the colony.<br>
<br>Stevenson returned to journalism in 1845 with a new <span class="italic">South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register</span>, but changed its name in 1847 to the <span class="italic">South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal</span>. In 1852 the paper ceased publication when most of his skilled staff left for the Victorian goldfields. In the same year he was appointed special coroner. He was one of a syndicate of six who were owners of the <span class="italic">Adelaide Times</span> for seven months from November 1853, and was the chief leader writer.<br>
<br>Stevenson was described by his granddaughter Violet de Mole as<blockquote>a tall powerfully-built Scot, six feet three in height, with keen brown eyes in a leonine head, athletic, a great shot and an excellent fisherman &hellip; He possessed a powerful and ruthless weapon in his pen which was unrivalled for its brilliant ease and satire. (Adelaide <span class="italic">Advertiser</span>, 12 Nov 1936)</blockquote>Stevenson died on 19 October 1856 at Finnis Street, North Adelaide, and was buried at the Adelaide suburb of Kensington on 20 October. He was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
