<span class="headword">Holland,  John Philip</span>  (1841&#150;1914), <span class="occ">inventor of the modern submarine</span>, was born on 24 February 1841 in Castle Street, Liscannor, co. Clare, Ireland, the son of John Holland, a coastguard, and Mary Scanlon. Educated first at Limerick, he was prevented by poor eyesight from going to sea, so he took the initial vows of the teaching order of the Christian Brothers and studied at their schools in Ennistimon and Limerick. After 1858 he taught in a number of their schools in Ireland, but in 1872 his family emigrated to America and a year later he obtained a dispensation to quit the order on the grounds of ill health and followed his parents. He had become interested at an early age in the possibility of constructing submersible boats and, as an Irish patriot, saw how they might be used against the ships of the British navy in the fight for Irish independence. During the previous century there had been various proposals, of a more or less fanciful nature, for boats to go under water, but the technical problems were, at that time, insurmountable. By 1870 Holland had drawn up plans for such boats, and while working as a teacher in Paterson, New Jersey, he developed his projected submarine to the stage where he felt he could offer it to the United States Navy; in 1875 they rejected it as the fantastic scheme of a civilian landsman. The Fenians in America, through Clan na Gael, decided to finance his first experimental one-man craft which was tested with some success in 1878. They then gave him a further substantial sum to build a full-size submarine which they hoped would be capable of crossing the Atlantic and destroying the British fleet. He gave up teaching to build the <i>Fenian Ram</i>, completed in 1881, which was 31 feet long with a displacement of 19 tons and a crew of three. The first to be equipped with ballast tanks, horizontal rudders, and weight compensation, it was extensively tested in the waters of New York harbour and in 1883 dived to a depth of 60 feet. The Fenians were very impressed and took it out of the inventor's hands, but they were unable to achieve any of their objectives and abandoned it soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Holland was married on 17 January 1887 in Brooklyn, New York, to Margaret Foley of Paterson, New Jersey. He continued his work but encountered various difficulties until in 1895 the J. P. Holland Torpedo Boat Company, which he had set up in 1893, was awarded a contract for $150,000 to build a submarine for the United States Navy. The <i>Plunger</i> was, however, not built to his specification, the navy insisting on incorporating its own ideas, and it was not a success. With only $5000 of his own capital left he began to build the <i>Holland</i> to his own design, 54 feet in length, 10 feet in diameter and with a submerged displacement of 75 tons. It was fitted with a petrol engine for surface propulsion and electric storage batteries and motor for running submerged. Armed with one torpedo tube and a pneumatic dynamite gun, it was launched in 1898 and, after searching tests, was purchased in 1900 by the United States government. A few months later six more were ordered, and within a short time further orders were placed by Russia, Japan, and Britain; five submarines were built under licence by Vickers at Barrow in Furness in 1902&#150;3. One of these, HMS <i>Holland No 1</i>, was lost under tow in 1913 but was raised and restored at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport.<br>
<br>To Holland, therefore, belongs the credit for developing the submarine to a state of practical utility, and in December 1900 he contributed an article on &#145;The submarine boat and its future&#146; to the <span class="italic">North American Review</span>, in which he foresaw many of the modern uses of the submarine in science, commerce, and exploration. This success was marred by animosity between Holland and the financial backers of the reorganized Electric Boat Company, and he turned his attention to other areas of research. In 1904 he invented a respirator for use in escaping from submarines underwater, and towards the end of his life he engaged in experiments in aeronautics. He died on 12 August 1914 in Newark, New Jersey, survived by his wife and four children.<br>
