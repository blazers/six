<span class="headword">Thorburn,  Robert</span>  (1818&#150;1885), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born at Dumfries on 10 March 1818, the son of a tradesman. He received his early education at Dumfries high school, where he developed a love of art. At fifteen he was sent to Edinburgh to study under Sir William Allan at the drawing academy of the Royal Institute of Scotland; he made rapid progress and won two first prizes. He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy between 1835 and 1856, and was made an honorary member in 1857; a self-portrait, now very badly bituminized, is in the academy's collection. As a native of Dumfries he enjoyed the special patronage of the duke of Buccleuch. About 1836 he went to London and entered the Royal Academy Schools. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1837 and 1884, and was elected an associate in 1848. On 16 October 1846, in Edinburgh, he married Elizabeth Robertson.<br>
<br>On 23 February 1844 Queen Victoria wrote of Thorburn in her journal: &#145;He is a young Scotchman, of great talent, who studied 2 winters in Italy, &amp; has painted some splendid miniatures, with such depth of colouring &amp; such power, as I have never before seen in a miniature&#146;  (D. Millar, 886). In that year he painted several important miniatures for the queen and Prince Albert; she described one of herself, given to her by the prince, as &#145;so like &amp; so beautiful&#146;  (ibid.). Also in 1844 Thorburn was paid &pound;123 15<i>s</i>. for five watercolour sketches, including portraits of Albert Edward, prince of Wales; Ernest II, duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; and Duke Ernest of W&uuml;rttemberg (Royal Collection). Ernest II was drawn during a visit between 20 November and 17 December 1844, when his wife also sat to Thorburn for a miniature. The sketch of the duke of W&uuml;rttemberg formed the basis for the life-sized half-length portrait painted for the 1844 room at Buckingham Palace. A miniature of Prince Albert in full armour, painted by Thorburn in 1843 (Royal Collection), was said to be the queen's favourite. In the Royal Academy exhibition of 1848 Thorburn exhibited a portrait of her with Princess Helena and Prince Alfred that had been painted &#145;by command of the Queen&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">RA exhibitors</span>, 378).<br>
<br>Thorburn's success as a miniature painter was soon secured, and for many years he shared the patronage of fashionable society with Sir William Charles Ross. Foster's <span class="italic">British Miniature Painters</span> contains a reproduction of a self-portrait miniature and a list of Thorburn's principal sitters, comprising most of the beautiful women of the time (pp. 95&#150;7); one of his most widely known portraits is that of Louise, duchess of Manchester (<i>c</i>.1853; priv. coll.). His carefully finished miniatures were larger than is usual, showing more of the figure and often accompanied by a landscape background. They were painted on large pieces of ivory, sometimes on pieces joined together, and are now subject to cracking. They were very much admired at the time of their production, and at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1855 Thorburn was awarded a gold medal. When photography began to supersede miniature painting he took to painting in oils more frequently; in later years he exhibited portraits, including crayon drawings, and subject pictures, often of a religious nature, at the Royal Academy, with moderate success. Examples of his work are in the Royal Collection, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, and the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Thorburn died at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 2 November 1885, having outlived the great reputation of his earlier years, and was survived by his wife. For probate his address was given as Winkston, Peeblesshire, sometime of Forest Field, Kelso; he gave the latter address when he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1879. In 1884, the last year in which he exhibited at the academy, his address was 17 Cumberland Walk, Tunbridge Wells, where his son Archibald was living when he was nominated executor of his will; another son, John, was living in London. Archibald Thorburn (1860&#150;1935) was a wildlife artist, well known for his paintings of birds.<br>
