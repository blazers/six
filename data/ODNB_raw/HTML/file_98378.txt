<span class="headword">Orr,  John</span>  (1885&#150;1966), <span class="occ">linguist and French scholar</span>, was born on 4 June 1885 at 4 Cross Side, Egremont, Cumberland, the son of Peter Orr and his wife, Lillias Duncan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Allan. His father, of Scottish origin, was a joiner; he emigrated to Australia with his family in 1885, settling first in Albany, Western Australia, then in Launceston, Tasmania, where Orr received his schooling. In 1902 he enrolled at the University of Tasmania with a scholarship, reading classics. In 1905 he won a Rhodes scholarship and entered Balliol College, Oxford, where, after a second in classical moderations in 1907, he graduated with a third-class degree in jurisprudence in 1909. His interests were wide and as an undergraduate he was president of the Arnold Society. He was tall and athletic, standing over six feet tall: he rowed in his college eight that went head of the river in 1907. Despite this he suffered ill health, especially a tendency to nervous depression all his life. A bout of this caused him to spend time in the south of France in 1910. There he met and married, on 5 March 1910, Augusta Berthe Brisac (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of a French family settled in St Petersburg. They had one son.<br>
<br>It was at this time that Orr's interest in medieval French and Romance linguistics developed; he studied in Paris at the Sorbonne, the &Eacute;cole des Hautes-&Eacute;tudes, the Coll&egrave;ge de France, and the &Eacute;cole des Langues Orientales under a number of masters including Joseph B&eacute;dier, Jules Gilli&eacute;ron, and Mario Roques. In 1913, on completion of his BLitt thesis, an edition of <span class="italic">Les &#339;uvres de Guiot de Provins</span>, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester. In 1915 he moved to a lectureship at East London College. At the beginning of the First World War he had joined the officer training corps in Manchester, and in 1916 he was seconded first to the Admiralty and then to the Military Intelligence Corps, serving in London and in France.<br>
<br>In 1919 Orr was appointed to the chair of French at the University of Manchester; he moved to the chair of French at the University of Edinburgh in 1933. Although he published a number of significant articles while in Manchester, it was in Edinburgh that his publishing career blossomed with his revised and augmented translation of Iorgu Iordan's <span class="italic">Introduction to Romance Linguistics</span> (1937), and his major essay, &#145;On homonymics&#146; (in <span class="italic">Studies in French Language and Mediaeval Literature presented to M. K. Pope</span>, 1939).<br>
<br>The Second World War was far from kind to Orr: his son was killed in action with the Royal Air Force in June 1944, and he himself suffered a serious breakdown lasting from 1940 until 1943. However, 1944 brought an event that stimulated all his energies and brought out his best qualities as an organizer, a lover of France, and a networker. The destruction of Caen and its university by allied bombardments in July galvanized Orr, who founded the Edinburgh&#150;Caen Fellowship to bring relief to the city and its population. His first proposal that Edinburgh should adopt Caen was rejected by the British government as inappropriate, but his tireless work and correspondence with members of the government, the duchess of Sutherland, the countess of Rosebery, and members of the French government in exile saw the fellowship operative by October 1944 and formally established as a war charity on 13 April 1945. Contributions in kind&#151;books for the devastated university library, clothes and food for the citizens&#151;and money flowed in. In recognition of his efforts Orr was invited to attend at the reopened University of Caen on 13 December 1945 to receive a doctorate <i>honoris causa</i>. The rector of the Acad&eacute;mie de Caen regretted that he could not invite Orr to speak on that occasion, but would invite him specially to lecture later, &#145;when the largest hall in the town would not hold the audience of grateful citizens who would want to listen&#146; to him  (R. Mazel, 30 Nov 1945, U. Edin. L., MS gen. 868/32). The rue du professeur John Orr in Caen was named in his honour.<br>
<br>After the war Orr continued his academic career, publishing many more articles and reviews, editions of Eustache d'Amiens, <span class="italic">Le boucher d'Abbeville</span> (1947), and Jehan Renart, <span class="italic">Le lai de l'ombre</span> (1948), and a collection of essays, <span class="italic">Words and Sounds in English and French</span> (1953). Correspondence associated with his edition of <span class="italic">Contes et po&egrave;mes</span> by Jules Supervielle (1950) led to a lasting and close friendship with the author. In 1951 Orr realized that the changed circumstances of higher education in Britain required a restructuring of his department. At his own urgent request the University of Edinburgh created a new chair of French literature and renamed Orr's chair that of French language and Romance linguistics. He held this chair until his retirement in 1955, serving also as the dean of the faculty of arts in 1950&#150;54.<br>
<br>Orr had always been committed to work beyond the university: in the 1920s and 1930s he had served on the committees of the Whitworth Institute and Manchester City Art Gallery; in the 1950s he was Edinburgh University's representative on the city of Edinburgh education committee, a member of the board of Edinburgh College of Art, and honorary vice-president of the Society of Scottish Artists. His efforts were instrumental in the founding of the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais d'&Eacute;cosse in 1946. From 1953 to 1955 his diplomatic skills saved the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Linguistique Romane from the extinction that had threatened it at its congress in Barcelona in 1953. He became president of the society in 1965. From 1957 to 1959 he suffered a relapse of his nervous illness, forcing his resignation from the executive council of the <span class="italic">Scottish National Dictionary</span>: a letter from the editor recalled that it was Orr's intervention, bringing the editorial team to the University of Edinburgh, &#145;which saved the dictionary from coming to an untimely end&#146;  (David Murison to John Orr, 26 June 1959, U. Edin. L., MS gen. 868/34).<br>
<br>Orr was much appreciated as a lecturer by students and colleagues alike. The interview of him published by the University of Edinburgh newspaper <span class="italic">Student</span> in its series &#145;Elders and betters&#146; brought out both his sharp mind and his great charm. The affection he inspired in his colleagues can best be seen in the correspondence between Orr and Georges Poulet in December 1950 in which Poulet's disappointment at being passed over for the second chair of French in Edinburgh was tempered by expressions of admiration for the man he still called his friend. In this matter Orr showed a hard-headedness with a distinctly modern ring, as he advised Poulet that his decision to concentrate on pure research to the exclusion of administrative responsibility made him unfit to lead a university department in the climate of post-war Britain. A similar blend of scientific rigour and a challenging sense of humour infused his research: among his many articles were those on <i>bougre</i>, <i>foutre</i>, and words with similarly &#145;scabrous&#146; etymologies. This unconventional side of his nature extended to his producing a mock epic poem, &#145;La geste des chinchons&#146;, satirizing the organization of, and the Franco government's impact on, the congress of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Linguistique Romane held in Barcelona in 1953.<br>
<br>Orr's many achievements earned him appropriate honours: he was elected a fellow of the British Academy (1952), received the Encomienda de Alfonso X el Sabio (1953), became president of the Modern Humanities Research Association (1954) and of the Association Internationale des &Eacute;tudes Fran&ccedil;aises (1955&#150;7), was promoted commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1955), was elected corresponding fellow of the Real Academia de Buenas Letras de Barcelona (1957), and was president of the International Federation of Modern Languages and Literatures (1963&#150;6). In addition to Caen he received honorary doctorates from the universities of Manchester, St Andrews, and the Sorbonne. He died in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 10 August 1966 following a heart attack. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> described him as &#145;the doyen and outstanding representative of Romance philology in Britain, and in the English-speaking world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Aug 1966), a well-deserved accolade, which was consecrated by its being quoted to illustrate the usage of the word <i>doyen</i> in the revised edition of <span class="italic">Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</span> in 1981.<br>
