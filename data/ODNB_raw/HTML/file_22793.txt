</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Primrose, Sir  Archibald</span>, first baronet, Lord Carrington  (1616&#150;1679), <span class="occ">legal official and judge</span>, was born on 16 May 1616, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22797/', "James Primrose (d. 1640)")</script>, clerk to the privy council of Scotland (1599&#150;1640), and his second wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of Richard Lawson (<i>fl</i>. 1603&#150;1622) of Boghall, Lanarkshire, presbyterian bookseller of Edinburgh. Little is known of Primrose's early life and education but he clearly studied law before he succeeded his late father as clerk to the privy council in September 1641.<br>
<br>Primrose's career was split into two halves by the Cromwellian interregnum. At first he acted as clerk to the convention of estates in 1643 and 1644. However, after the royalist victory at Kilsyth he joined the army of Montrose, persuading others to switch sides. He was taken prisoner as Montrose was defeated at the battle of Philiphaugh on 13 September 1645, and found guilty of treason at the covenanting parliament of St Andrews in 1646, yet suffered only a spell in prison. Having taken part in the failed engagement of 1648, that last attempt to unite moderate Scottish royalists with the interests of Charles I, he was on 10 March 1649 deprived of the office of clerk of the privy council by the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span>. However, he was absolved by the commission of the kirk on 4 January 1651, pardoned by the committee of estates on 10 January, and fully reinstated on 6 June 1651. Primrose went on to accompany Charles II on his march into England and was created a baronet in August 1651 just after being knighted. But after the disastrous defeat of the Scottish army at the battle of Worcester, Primrose had his estates sequestrated and remained out of office during the protectorate.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Primrose was appointed lord clerk register on 7 August 1660. It was necessary for him to buy off Sir William Fleming to whom Charles II had granted the post during his exile. On 15 February 1661 he was appointed a lord of session under the title Lord Carrington, and also a lord of exchequer and member of the Scottish privy council. As clerk register he was instructed to draft legislation reasserting royal authority and especially the <span class="roman">Rescissory Act</span>, by which all the acts of the Scottish parliament since 1633 were rescinded. Gilbert Burnet's idea that Carrington suggested this sweeping act &#145;half in jest&#146; is incredible  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.213). Although associated with the Clarendonian party in England and a follower of the party of the royal commissioner John, earl of Middleton, in opposition to John Maitland, earl of Lauderdale, secretary of state, Carrington was astute enough to oppose the 1662 <span class="roman">Act of Billeting</span> which was designed to destroy Lauderdale. He, therefore, retained his offices after Middleton's fall from power in 1663&#150;4, his position apparently &#145;right and fixed&#146; in Lauderdale's interest  (Airy, 1.180).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Carrington fell foul of Lauderdale's second wife, Elizabeth, countess of Dysart, whom Lauderdale had married in 1672. Intrigues attributed to her led to his resignation from the office of clerk register by 11 June 1676. The position passed in November 1677 to the duchess's kinsman Sir Thomas Murray of Glendook. As compensation Carrington was granted the office of justice-general with its inferior emoluments. He then had an important role in the trial of the covenanter James Mitchell. Mitchell had been arrested in 1674 for an attempt in 1668 to murder Archbishop James Sharp and had been promised his life by Lauderdale and the privy council provided he confessed. After his confession Mitchell was left in prison. However, he was brought to trial again in January 1678, the indemnity conveniently forgotten. No doubt for reasons both of revenge and of justice, Carrington made known the extract of the privy council register to embarrass Lauderdale who hid behind a lapse of memory. This made not the slightest difference to the outcome and Mitchell was executed. In October, Carrington was, not unexpectedly, deprived of the office of justice-general.<br>
<br>Carrington married, first, in or before 1641, Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir James Keith of Benholm, and second, in or before 1657, Agnes, daughter of Sir William Gray of Pittendrum and widow of Sir James Dundas of Newlinston. William, his eldest son from his first marriage, succeeded to the baronetcy. His youngest son of the same marriage, Gilbert (1654&#150;1731), served on the Rhine and in the Low Countries under Marlborough and by 1710 had risen to the rank of major-general. The only son by the second marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22794/', "Archibald Primrose")</script>, became the first earl of Rosebery in 1703.<br>
<br>Carrington became extremely wealthy. In 1662 he acquired the lands and barony of Barnbougle in Dalmeny, Linlithgowshire, from the earl of Haddington for 160,000 merks (&pound;106,000 Scots); in due course this became the seat of the Rosebery family. He died on 27 November 1679 with an estate valued at &pound;58,000 Scots, including &pound;27,000 of cash and gold, and was buried at the parish church of Dalmeny. He was well read and died with a library valued at &pound;200. He was a born conservative, an astute politician, and a believer in compromise. Burnet, Carrington's contemporary, describes a conscientious public servant, &#145;dexterous &hellip; in business &hellip; he had always expedients ready at every difficulty [and] &hellip; was always for soft councils and slow methods&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.192). His long tenure as clerk register is testament to these qualities.<br>
