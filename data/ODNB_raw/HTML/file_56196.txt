<span class="headword">Jackson,  (John) Enderby</span>  (1827&#150;1903), <span class="occ">musician and impresario</span>, was born in Mytongate, Kingston upon Hull, on 14 January 1827, the son of John Jackson who was a tallow chandler and soap-boiler, a trade which had been in the family for several generations. Enderby Jackson was a talented musician; he played several instruments and composed. But it was as an entrepreneur and impresario that he made his mark, inventing the brass band contest in its modern form.<br>
<br>Jackson's mother died when he was a child and his relationship with his father was not easy. He attended Hull grammar school, where he distinguished himself, but because music was not taught at the school, he took lessons privately with several teachers, becoming proficient on flute, French horn, piano, and in singing. He also took lessons in harmony and composition. He claimed to have been inspired to a career in music when, as a small boy enlisted to assist his father in the administration of footlight candles at the Theatre Royal, Hull, he heard Jullien's orchestra perform. He ignored the family business and became a professional musician playing in theatre and touring bands in northern towns. On 18 January 1860 Jackson married Eliza S. Smith (1837&#150;1909) of Nettleham, Lincoln; they had four children.<br>
<br>Jackson's observation of the popularity of competitive agricultural events inspired the idea of brass band contests, which he organized under his &#145;National Musical Contests&#146; enterprise. His first &#145;Open Contest&#146; was held at the Belle Vue Gardens in Manchester in July 1856. Its success launched band contests as a feature of Victorian life, and many other provincial contests followed. Jackson negotiated tenaciously with railway companies to provide modestly priced transport for mass audiences travelling to his contests, with the result that the North Eastern Railway Company agreed to provide privileged prices for bands and their supporters. In 1859 the Crystal Palace Company engaged him to run a bell-ringing contest at Sydenham. The following year Jackson was similarly engaged to put on a band contest. This was spectacularly successful: 72 bands attended and they were listened to by an audience of over 22,000. Further contests were held at the Crystal Palace in the following two years.<br>
<br>Jackson was always ambitious to add an international dimension to the brass band contest, but though he visited many European countries to attend musical congresses and expositions, his vision of a &#145;Music Unity of Nations&#146; was never entirely fulfilled. In September 1871 he left England for Australia and, more briefly, New Zealand and South Africa, with his London Star Company Comique. He returned to England in July 1873, and became the sole agent for many important foreign bands, including Lumbley's band from Copenhagen and Gilmore's from the USA. He was also agent for British and foreign instrument manufacturers.<br>
<br>Jackson died suddenly on 9 April 1903 of a brain haemorrhage, at his home, Sherwood House, 2 Sherwood Street, Scarborough, and was buried in Manor Road cemetery in the town. Although he was a man of eclectic talents, his surviving musical works show him to have been no more than a competent tunesmith. He dabbled in local politics and was a gifted painter and designer who, in 1891, put forward plans to join the two bays of Scarborough. Jackson's autobiographical writings reveal him as a man of considerable self-confidence and self-opinion, and he was one of the most effective impresarios of his time. His retrospective claim that his mission had been &#145;The Propagation of Music amongst the Working Classes&#146;  (Jackson) probably disguised more mundane, financial motives, but his impact on the musical life of ordinary Victorians cannot be denied.<br>
