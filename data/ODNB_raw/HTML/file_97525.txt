<span class="headword">Farr,  Dennis Larry Ashwell</span>  (1929&#150;2006), <span class="occ">art historian and museum director</span>, was born on 3 April 1929 at 30 Leagrave Road, Luton, Bedfordshire, the youngest of three children of Arthur William Farr, who sold, and later manufactured, hats, and his wife, Helen Eva, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashwell. Educated at Luton grammar school, where he was encouraged in his ambition to study the history of art by Ronald Smoothey, the enthusiastic senior art master, he went to the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, in 1947 (graduating BA in 1950). At the time Anthony Blunt had just become director and the student body consisted predominantly of former servicemen and -women. At Blunt's suggestion he wrote his MA dissertation on William Etty, the early nineteenth-century painter of nudes, which was subsequently published with a full catalogue, as <span class="italic">William Etty</span> (1958).<br>
<br>In 1954 Farr was appointed assistant keeper at the Tate Gallery, just when the <span class="roman">National Gallery and Tate Gallery Act</span> gave full independent status to the Tate for the first time. Farr described his early years there in an illuminating reminiscence in the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span> (Jan 2006) containing numerous amusing anecdotes, including a description of the occasion when the then director, John Rothenstein, punched the well-known, irascible collector, Douglas Cooper, on the nose. He worked on several exhibitions, notably a Duncan Grant retrospective, and he was on the committee of the legendary Romantic Movement exhibition, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Council of Europe in 1959. But the long-term fruit of his period at the Tate was the catalogue <span class="italic">Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture</span> (1964), which he wrote with Mary Chamot and Martin Butlin, and a general book, <span class="italic">British Sculpture since 1945</span> (1965). On 6 June 1959 he married Diana Pullein-Thompson (<i>b</i>. 1925), a successful author of childrens' books, and daughter of Captain Harold James Pullein-Thompson. They had two children, Benedict and Joanna.<br>
<br>Relatively brief interludes as curator of the Paul Mellon Collection in Washington (1965&#150;6) and then as senior lecturer in fine art at Glasgow University (1967&#150;9) led to the appointment that turned out to be central to Farr's career, the directorship of Birmingham City Museums and Art Gallery (1969&#150;80). The Art Gallery is outstanding among the regional collections in England and under Farr's direction it enjoyed a golden period, marked by major acquisitions, notably a Giovanni Bellini altarpiece and two views of Warwick Castle by Canaletto. His calm and modest demeanour and human kindness and the encouragement he gave to his staff were widely recognized and appreciated. His high standing in Birmingham was attested in a variety of ways, not least in his appointment as JP (1977&#150;80) and the award of the honorary degree of DLitt by the university (1981).<br>
<br>In 1980 Farr was appointed director of the Courtauld Institute Gallery, where his first task was the integration and display of the recent munificent bequest of Count Antoine Seilern, the Princes Gate collection. This was mainly of Flemish and Italian paintings and drawings, and it added a new dimension to Samuel Courtauld's original collection of French impressionists and post-impressionists. A few years later Farr planned and supervised the collection's move from its modest home in Woburn Square to grand surroundings in the fine rooms at Somerset House. The new galleries were opened to the public in 1990 and Farr was appointed CBE in the following year. His popularity with his colleagues at all levels was attested by the security staff, who insisted on giving him their own leaving party when he retired in 1993.<br>
<br>Farr's rather easygoing manner belied a great deal of energy and commitment. As well as the administrative tasks of his directorships he engaged in research, particularly, though by no means exclusively, on twentieth-century British art, and produced numerous publications. Most notable was his volume in the <span class="roman">Oxford History of English Art</span> series, <span class="italic">English Art, 1870&#150;1940</span> (1978), and his monumental book on the sculptor Lynn Chadwick, written with Eva Chadwick (1990). Nor did he shirk the demands of the public arena of his profession. A valued member of numerous committees, he was, uniquely, both president of the Museums Association (1979&#150;80) and chairman of the Association of Art Historians (1983&#150;6). On the academic side he was editor of <span class="roman">Clarendon Studies in the History of Art</span> (1985&#150;2001).<br>
<br>Retirement from the Courtauld gave Farr more time for his favourite hobby, riding, in pursuit of which he and his wife moved to Haslemere in Surrey. Yet he continued to be in demand as a guest curator of exhibitions and he took on a Francis Bacon retrospective at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven in 1999. He also contributed fourteen entries to the <span class="italic">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</span>, including a substantial article on William Etty. His career provides an eloquent example of an able manager who was also a gifted curator and a productive scholar. He died of a cerebral haemorrhage at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, on 6 December 2006, and was cremated at Guildford crematorium following a funeral service at St Bartholomew's Church, Haslemere, on 14 December. A memorial service was held at St Mary-le-Strand on 19 April 2007. Farr was survived by his wife, Diana, and their two children.<br>
