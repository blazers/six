<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Connor,  Edric Esclus</span>  (1913&#150;1968), <span class="occ">actor and singer</span>, was born on 2 August 1913 in the village of Mayaro, Trinidad, the son of Edwin Connor, shoemaker and small farmer. At sixteen he won a scholarship from the Trinidad government railway to study engineering at the Victoria Institute, Port of Spain, where he won the Stephen gold medal for mechanical engineering. In his spare time he studied Caribbean folk singing. During the war he worked on the construction of the American naval air base in Trinidad and saved enough money to move to Britain. In 1944 he left Trinidad, intending to continue his engineering studies at South-east Essex Technical College, but he carried with him some notes on Caribbean folk music. He had already presented a series about Caribbean folk music on Radio Trinidad and on his journey to Britain he carried letters of introduction to the BBC. Two weeks after his arrival he made his d&eacute;but on BBC radio in <span class="italic">Calling the West Indies</span>, a programme for listeners in the Caribbean. His appealing voice and charming personality made a deep impression.<br>
<br>From 1945 to 1947 Connor was featured in the popular music series <span class="italic">Serenade in Sepia</span> with Evelyn Dove, and its success led to a television version in 1946. In the early post-war years he became a popular television personality in BBC music and variety programmes, but perhaps his most important appearances were those involving the promotion of Caribbean music and dance. In 1951 he organized many concerts for the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra during its ten-week stay, including its d&eacute;but at the Festival of Britain celebrations at London's South Bank. He married a Trinidadian law student, Pearl Cynthia Nunez [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94898/', "Mogotsi, Pearl Cynthia Connor- (1924&#150;2005)")</script>], in London on 26 June 1948. Many years later she described her husband as<blockquote>a contained, disciplined person. Charming and soft-spoken. He was rarely agitated. He always gave the impression of being at ease. He was an independent man who believed in pulling his weight. He was an avid student. A self-made person. He read widely. He had a great collection of books on all sorts of subjects. He embraced literature, music and so on. (Bourne, 98)</blockquote>In 1952 Connor made his film acting d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Cry, the Beloved Country</span>, based on Alan Paton's novel about apartheid in South Africa. During the next decade, he played featured roles in a number of British and American productions, including the harpooner Daggoo in <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> (1956) and Balthazar in <span class="italic">King of Kings</span> (1961). In 1958, when Paul Robeson turned down the role of Gower in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Pericles</span> for the Stratford Memorial Theatre, he recommended Connor for it. Connor thus became the first black actor to appear in a Shakespeare season at Stratford upon Avon. This proved to be one of the high points of his career in the theatre.<br>
<br>Though Connor succeeded in almost everything he set out to do, there were some doors that remained firmly closed. As his wife, Pearl, explained:<blockquote>He took the opportunity to go to America and train in opera. He had this marvellous baritone, and in America he learned about technique &hellip; [but] in those days they had no room for people like Edric. It wasn't even thought about at that time, that a black actor from the Caribbean could ever perform in the opera houses of Britain. Yet, though he sung the roles of Amonasro in <span class="italic">Aida</span> and King Boris in <span class="italic">Boris Godunov</span> in Europe, Edric was never asked to sing at Covent Garden. It was very frustrating for him. (Bourne, 105&#150;6)</blockquote>Connor also wanted to become a television producer and director at a time when no black person could be found behind the camera, except as a scene shifter. His wife recalled: &#145;He trained with the BBC. This gave him a qualification but, after he completed his training, he wasn't given the opportunity to direct in film or television. Not one BBC assignment came his way&#146;  (Bourne, 108). Determined to become a film-maker, in the early 1960s he directed a series of short films about the Caribbean which he funded himself with help from the British Film Institute. They included <span class="italic">Carnival fantastique</span>, a documentary about the famous Trinidad carnival. Connor was Britain's first black film director, but he faced opposition from people in the film industry who categorized him as a singer, and would not take him seriously. In the early 1960s Connor and his wife were instrumental in forming the Negro Theatre Workshop, a company of thirty black actors.<br>
<br>Connor suffered a stroke and died at the National Hospital, St Pancras, London, on 16 October 1968. He was survived by his wife, Cynthia, and their two children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104327/', "Geraldine Connor")</script>, a theatre director and composer, and Peter. As a Caribbean performer in Britain he had been a trailblazer, an artist touched with greatness, and an inspiration to those who followed. His wife recalled:<blockquote>He saw himself as an ambassador for Trinidad &hellip; we black people were being judged all the time so we felt we had to show our best &hellip; but he died much too young. He hadn't achieved everything he wanted to do. But he moved into this country and took every opportunity he had here &hellip; to make a lasting mark so that those who came after him would know that it was possible. (Bourne, 112)</blockquote>
