<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;<em>c.</em>1807), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, the son of John Fitzgerald, a landowner who was engaged in the malt trade, was born at Newpark, co. Wexford, into a propertied Roman Catholic family. His mother's maiden name was Hay. Although reputed to have been educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and called to the bar, the records of both institutions do not support these traditions. More certain is that he took up residence in Newpark upon inheriting the family estate and malting business. Although a member of the loyalist Shelmalier yeomanry, he secretly enrolled in the revolutionary United Irishmen and was, very probably, the adjutant-general elect for Wexford. He was arrested after being implicated by a colleague on 26 May 1798 and was committed to the county gaol just as the rebels were taking to the field. He was bailed on the 29th to open negotiations with the rebels at Enniscorthy under Father John Murphy but such was the acclaim which greeted his arrival that he was instated as a senior insurgent commander.<br>
<br>On 30 May Fitzgerald was the first rebel leader to ascertain that the county town had been evacuated by its garrison and, having interested himself to preserve the lives and properties of pro-government families, visited Newpark. Upon his return to the town the next day he was passed over for chief command of county insurgents in favour of Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey, a compromise candidate, but he none the less assumed nominal leadership of the 15,000 strong north Wexford rebel army. At the pivotal battle of Arklow, co. Wicklow, on 9 June, Fitzgerald led the rebel Shelmalier gunmen during their attack on the fishery. When this assault was called off owing to lack of ammunition Fitzgerald and other important officers led their men into the Wicklow Mountains before rallying at Vinegar Hill on the 21st for what transpired to be a major defeat.<br>
<br>The total destruction of Newpark on 21&#150;2 June cost Fitzgerald about &pound;5000 and this loss, in conjunction with army atrocities, evidently rendered him increasingly militant. Rebel forces under Fitzgerald and his Wicklow cousin Garret Byrne won a pyrrhic victory at Hacketstown on the 25th and five days later defeated a strong cavalry patrol at Ballyellis. Rebuffs at Carnew, Ballyrahan, and White Heaps between 30 June and 5 July sapped insurgent strength to the extent that only guerrilla-style tactics were prudent subsequently. A desperate foray from Wicklow into Kildare and co. Meath on 8 July was opposed by Fitzgerald, who reluctantly abided by the majority decision. When 4000 rebels were repulsed by the small garrison of Clonard (co. Meath) on the 11th, Fitzgerald decided to leave their ranks and accept the terms of surrender on offer from government.<br>
<br>By 21 July 1798 Fitzgerald and over a dozen leading insurgents were detained as state prisoners until they could be permanently exiled. Fitzgerald, Byrne, and William Aylmer, however, were privately assured that they could reside in England and return home in a few years. This controversial deal fell through in March 1799 when the Fitzgerald group was arrested in Bath on suspicion of treason; they were deported to Hamburg soon afterwards. Fitzgerald suffered greatly from consumption when living with Byrne in humble lodgings in Altona, Hamburg, where he died in or about 1807.<br>
