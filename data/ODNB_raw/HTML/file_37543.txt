<span class="headword">Hickman,  Henry</span>  (1800&#150;1830), <span class="occ">promoter of anaesthesia</span>, was born at Lady Halton in the parish of Bromfield, Shropshire, on 27 January 1800. He was the fifth son and seventh child in the family of eight sons and five daughters of John Hickman, farmer (also clerk of the course at Ludlow races), and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Benjamin Hill, yeoman, of Stanton Lacy. From 1819 he sometimes inserted Hill after Henry, although this was not a baptismal name. His early education, apprenticeship, and hospital attendance are unknown save for a surviving fair-copy notebook dated 1816&#150;18, containing extracts from textbooks and a record of attendance for two weeks at Brookes's school of anatomy, London. In November 1819 Hickman matriculated at Edinburgh, registered with the university, and joined the Royal Medical Society, but he did not graduate. In 1820, although under age, he became MRCS. On 29 May 1821 Hickman married Eliza Hannah, daughter of Benjamin Gardner, a farmer, of Leigh Court, near Worcester; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Hickman set up practice as a surgeon in Ludlow. Advertising for an apprentice he promised instruction in the different branches of the profession and access to his museum. In May 1824, however, before moving to Shifnal, near Telford, he auctioned some of the natural history specimens. Commercial directories listed him as physician in Shifnal.<br>
<br>In February 1824 Hickman wrote to T. A. Knight FRS, suggesting the use of suspended animation to tranquillize fear and relieve suffering during surgical operations. He reported standard surgical procedures on animals, rendered insensible under a bell glass by denying them fresh air or by administering carbon dioxide, without evidence of pain and with full recovery. Usually haemorrhage was trifling and healing clean; he attributed the latter to the antiputrescent properties of carbon dioxide. The origins of his inspiration, twenty years before Horace Wells discovered nitrous oxide anaesthesia, are unknown. Suggestions that Hickman experimented with nitrous oxide remain unsubstantiated.<br>
<br>In August 1824 Hickman produced a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A letter on suspended animation, containing experiments showing that it may be safely employed during operations on animals, with a view of ascertaining its probable utility in surgical operations on the human subject, addressed to T. A. Knight esq. of Downton Castle, Herefordshire, one of the presidents of the Royal Society</span>. The next line (overscored on the only surviving copy) reads: &#145;&hellip; and read before it by Sir Humphrey Davy&#146;&#151;an event which did not take place. The text was also reproduced in the <span class="italic">Shrewsbury Chronicle</span>; <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> responded in 1826 with a scathing letter, under the heading &#145;Surgical Humbug&#146;, signed &#145;Antiquack&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1828 Hickman appealed to Charles X, king of France, for the collaboration of the king's medical schools with his experiments on insensibility produced by &#145;introduction of certain gases into the lungs&#146;; these were ridiculed by the Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine. On his return to England, Hickman practised in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire. He died at Tenbury Wells on 2 April 1830 and was buried at Bromfield three days later.<br>
