<span class="headword">Lupton,  William</span>  (1676&#150;1726), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 1 June 1676 at Bentham, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Lupton, who served as rector there for fifty years. William matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 30 March 1694, and graduated BA in 1697, MA in 1700, BD on 14 February 1709, and DD on 15 February 1712. He was elected a fellow of Lincoln College in 1698, and briefly served as curate to George Bull at Avening, Gloucestershire. It was probably through Bull's influence that he became rector of Richmond, Yorkshire, in 1705. He resigned this position in the following year and was appointed lecturer of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London; and in 1714 he became preacher of Lincoln's Inn and afternoon preacher at the Temple. On 13 September 1715 he was presented to the ninth prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral.<br>
<br>Described as a &#145;violent partizan of the high church&#146;  (Noble, 3.110), Lupton was known to be a good preacher. Robert Nelson spoke of his sermons as &#145;a fit model for the preachers of the rising generation&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 1.1144). His reputation led to his selection as the preacher for the fiftieth anniversary of the episcopal consecration of Nathaniel Crew, and to his delivery of the Lady Moyer's lectures at St Paul's, London. He published several of his sermons separately, and a collection of sermons was published posthumously in 1729.<br>
<br>Although he claimed in his farewell sermon at St Dunstan's that his sermons had been focused on the &#145;practical duties of religion&#146;  (Lupton, <span class="italic">Christian Conversation</span>, 40&#150;41), they did at times have political implications. He was notable for his championship of the doctrine of eternal punishment, and upheld the orthodox view of this doctrine in a sermon preached before the University of Oxford on 24 November 1706, entitled <span class="italic">The Eternity of Future Punishment Proved and Vindicated</span> (1708). In this sermon, which was one of several attacks by high-churchmen on John Tillotson's sermon preached before Queen Mary on 7 March 1690, Lupton claimed that the reflections of Tillotson's sermon were &#145;not only precarious, but plainly false&#146;  (Lupton, <span class="italic">Eternity</span>, 9). Another address with political overtones came on 30 January 1724, when he preached before the House of Commons an anniversary sermon for the martyrdom of Charles I entitled <span class="italic">National Sins Fatal to Prince and People</span> (1724). In it he suggested that the wickedness of the people led to the downfall and sufferings of the king, an event allowed by God so that the rebellious might &#145;fall into the pit&#146;. Lupton complained of attempts during his lifetime to &#145;demolish [Charles's] virtues, and improve his infirmities scarce separable from man, into vices of the first magnitude&#146;  (Lupton, <span class="italic">National Sins</span>, 28&#150;9).<br>
<br>Lupton died at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 13 December 1726, and was buried there.<br>
