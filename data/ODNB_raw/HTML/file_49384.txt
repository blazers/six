<span class="headword">MacDougall,  Ewen</span>, lord of Argyll  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1268), <span class="occ">king in the Hebrides</span>, was the son of Duncan of Argyll, king in the Hebrides, and grandson of Dugald, also king in the Hebrides. Dugald, who is the eponym of the clan MacDougall, was the son of Somerled (<i>d</i>. 1164), king of the Hebrides and <i>regulus</i> of Argyll and Kintyre.<br>
<br>In 1248 MacDougall and his kinsman Dugald mac Ruairi sailed to Bergen seeking the title of king in the Hebrides (or Sudreys) from King H&aacute;kon of Norway (<i>r</i>. 1217&#150;63), who claimed overlordship. H&aacute;kon recognized Ewen as king and, on the death of Harald &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson, king of Man and the Hebrides, in 1249, sent Ewen to the isles with a general commission to act on his behalf. However, Alexander II, king of Scots, MacDougall's overlord in Argyll, who sought to incorporate Man and the Hebrides into his own kingdom, led an army to Argyll, and demanded that Ewen renounce his allegiance to H&aacute;kon and surrender his castles. No man can serve two masters, said Alexander. On the contrary, said Ewen, it was quite possible so long as the masters were not enemies. Ewen refused to give up his Norwegian allegiance. Alexander pressed on against him but caught fever, and on 8 July 1249 died on the island of Kerrera, by Oban, in the heart of Ewen's territories. &#145;While wishing to disinherit an innocent man&#146;, wrote Matthew Paris, &#145;he unexpectedly breathed out with that ambition the breath of life&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 5.89).<br>
<br>In 1250 MacDougall was in the Isle of Man, where he gave offence to the Manxmen by adopting the style <i>rex insularum</i>, and was driven out. In 1253 he and Dugald were again in Bergen, from where they sailed with King H&aacute;kon against Denmark. In 1255, through the mediation of Henry III of England, Ewen was restored to Argyll.<br>
<br>In 1263 MacDougall again found himself in confrontation with a major ruler. H&aacute;kon of Norway sailed in person to the Hebrides to assert his rights against the Scots. He required his sub-kings in the Hebrides, including Ewen, to join the expedition. Ewen refused and was dispossessed. The Norwegian expedition met with disaster, however, King H&aacute;kon dying in the Orkneys on his return to Norway after the battle of Largs. By the treaty of Perth between Scotland and Norway in 1266 Man and the Hebrides were ceded to Scotland, and MacDougall was restored to his island possessions. His last recorded appearance is in 1268.<br>
<br>Descended from many generations of Hebridean sea-kings, Ewen MacDougall seems to have been equally at home in the Gaelic and Scandinavian worlds. His many castles included Dunstaffnage in mainland Argyll, the impressive hall house of Aros on Mull, and the island stronghold of Cairnburgh between Mull and Tiree. He defied two powerful kings in the space of twenty years yet retained all his lands. It has been argued that Ewen left only daughters. However, there seems little doubt that he was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49385/', "Alexander MacDougall of Argyll")</script>, with other sons, and the lineal ancestor of the later chiefs of MacDougall. Ewen's daughter Mary married in succession Magnus &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson, king of Man and the Hebrides (<i>d</i>. 1265), Malise, earl of Strathearn (<i>d</i>. 1271), Hugh, lord of Abernethy (<i>d</i>. 1291/2), and Warin Fitzwarin (<i>d</i>. 1299)&#151;a wide selection which gives some indication of the status and far-ranging connections of Ewen MacDougall and his family.<br>
<br>Ewen's name occurs in contemporary sources in a variety of disguises, the Gaelic Eoghan (Ewen) being readily confused with Eoin (for John). Thus he appears in the Manx chronicle as Johannes Dugaldi, and in Norwegian sources as Jon Duncansson. Matthew Paris calls him Oenus of Argyll. His Gaelic style may well have been Eogan MacSomairle. In his sole surviving charter he names himself Eugenius. During the thirteenth century the descendants of Somerled split into three distinct segments: the MacDougalls, the MacDonalds, and the MacRuaris. Later generations looked back to Ewen as a chief of the MacDougalls.<br>
