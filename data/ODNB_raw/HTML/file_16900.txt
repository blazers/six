<span class="headword">Lokert <span class="st"> [Lockhart]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1485&#150;1547), <span class="occ">logician and theologian</span>, was born in Ayr, to John Lokkert and Marion Multray (<i>d</i>. 1500). He entered the University of Paris, where he is first referred to in 1504 in the book of receipts of the German nation in the university, the &#145;nation&#146; to which all Scottish students were assigned. Lokert studied arts, along with his half-brother John, under the Scot David Cranston at the Coll&egrave;ge de Montaigu, and took his master's degree in 1505. In the same year he gave his inaugural lecture as regent in arts. With his theology studies underway he taught arts in the Coll&egrave;ge de Rheims where he gave a full course of three and a half years, before returning to teach arts at Montaigu as a colleague of Noel Beda, John Mair, and David Cranston. In 1514, having taught a course on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> of Peter Lombard, he became bachelor of theology, and in that same year he published his first book, on &#145;notions&#146;, concepts with which we represent the world to ourselves. The book, much the most popular he wrote, went into seven editions during his lifetime. In 1516 he published an important edition of fourteenth-century writings on physics by Buridan, Thimon, and Albert of Saxony, and three years later he prepared the alphabetic table of contents of the fourth edition of Mair's commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, thereby providing evidence for the good relations between himself and Mair. Also in 1519 Lokert was elected prior of the Coll&egrave;ge de Sorbonne, the headquarters of the faculty of theology in the University of Paris. About this time he moved from Montaigu to the Coll&egrave;ge de La Marche, where he lectured on logic; in 1520 he brought out a commentary on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Posterior Analytics</span>. In that same year he was awarded a doctorate in theology.<br>
<br>In 1521 Lokert returned to Scotland to take up a post as provost of the collegiate church of Crichton, in the village of Crichton, 6 miles south-east of Dalkeith. In December of the same year he was incorporated in the University of St Andrews, a move that seems to have been made as preparation for his election in February 1522 as rector of that university. In that post he deployed his skills to effect a grand revision of the examining procedures at the university, a revision that brought St Andrews quite closely into line with Paris practices. Lokert continued to publish works on logic during his three-year period as rector, bringing out in 1523 <span class="italic">De oppositionibus</span> (on the relations of contradiction, contrariety, and sub-contrariety), and around the same time publishing his <span class="italic">De terminis</span> (on the nature and variety of terms). The following year saw his <span class="italic">De sillogismis</span>, a very detailed investigation of syllogistic reasoning.<br>
<br>Near the start of 1525 Lokert returned to Paris to resume his fellowship of the Coll&egrave;ge de Sorbonne and his membership of the faculty of theology. In addition he became head of the Scots College in Paris, a shadowy body founded in 1325 by David Moray, who as bishop of Moray had arranged for funds to be provided to enable scholars from his diocese to study in Paris. In January 1526 the then bishop of Moray, Robert Shaw, &#145;provydit Mr George Lokart, professor of theologie &hellip; then resident at Paris, ourseer of the studentis&#146; of the Scots College  (Durkan, &#145;George Lockhart&#146;). Sadly none of the college papers of the period of Lokert's headship have survived. Other aspects of Lokert's work at this time are, however, well documented, especially his involvement in an attempt, masterminded by Noel Beda, administrative head of the faculty of theology, to have certain of Erasmus's works condemned as heretical. Lokert was one of the thirteen members of a commission established by Beda to investigate an attack by Erasmus on Beda. Lokert was in a difficult position, since Erasmus had the support of the king, Fran&ccedil;ois I, and Lokert no doubt felt his vulnerability as a foreign national criticizing a man whom the king was trying to attract to the newly founded Coll&egrave;ge de France in Paris.<br>
<br>By this time Lokert had ceased to publish new works, and it may have been the increasingly stressful circumstances at Paris, with bitter in-fighting at the faculty of theology, including potentially lethal charges of heresy, that caused this cessation and led eventually to his return to the west coast of Scotland. For a brief period, from 1533 to 1534, he was archdeacon of Teviotdale, and in March 1534 he was appointed dean of Glasgow, a post he held until his death. As dean he was required to be in Glasgow for six months each year and to preside over chapter meetings. He died on 22 June 1547. In 1542 he had arranged for an anniversary mass for the souls of his parents to be said in the church of St John the Baptist in Ayr; he had also arranged that such a mass be said on his own death for himself and his half-brother John. Additionally, the register of decisions of the Sorbonne for 8 June 1549 records that &#145;with the consent of all&#146; it was agreed that on the day after Quasimodo Sunday (the Sunday after Easter) an obit was thenceforward to be said for &#145;our master Loquart&#146;  (Durkan, &#145;George Lockhart&#146;).<br>
<br>George Lokert was a logician of formidable power, who wrote with great lucidity on highly technical and complex issues. In particular, his analysis of propositions which contain two quantifiers relates in interesting ways to modern problems in logic, and can be used to resolve difficulties which were thought insoluble before the work of Gottlob Frege (1848&#150;1925). But he was also a devout man on the conservative wing of the church. The Reformation and the encroachment of Renaissance humanism must have been deeply distasteful to him. He dedicated himself to the maintenance of the old order, and died some thirteen years before the new order took a firm grip on his native country.<br>
