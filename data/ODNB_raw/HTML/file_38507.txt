<span class="headword">Gower,  Henrietta Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Harriet]</span>  Leveson-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Henrietta Elizabeth Cavendish]</span>, Countess Granville  (1785&#150;1862), <span class="occ">society hostess</span>, was born at Devonshire House, Piccadilly, London, on 29 August 1785, the younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58758/', "William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire (1748&#150;1811)")</script>, and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4934/', "Georgiana Cavendish (1757&#150;1806)")</script>, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38713/', "John Spencer, first Earl Spencer")</script>. Her devotion to her mother, &#145;the beautiful duchess&#146;, was the mainspring of her happy childhood, while her elder sister, Georgiana (known as &#145;G&#146;), and her young brother, Lord Hartington, were the focus of her liveliest affections. The duke was aloof and rarely seen. The Chatsworth schoolroom, under the supervision of Selina Trimmer, had other pupils, including the natural son and daughter of her father and his mistress, Lady Elizabeth Foster, who herself lived with the Devonshires in perfect amity. Moreover, the flock of cousins from the family of her aunt, Henrietta, Lady Bessborough, often stayed at Chatsworth.<br>
<br>Patrician by birth, the scion of a great whig family, Hary-O (as she was known in the family before her marriage) spoke in the &#145;bleating drawl&#146; of the Devonshire House set. Although no beauty, she had wit, intelligence, and shrewdness; her sharp eye missed little but &#145;in high croak and spirits&#146; viewed with tolerance the world of drums, dandies, gossip, and matchmaking in which she moved. After her sister's marriage in 1801 to George Howard, later sixth earl of Carlisle, she wrote to her almost daily, until Lady Carlisle's death in 1858. These letters to &#145;G&#146;, observant, critical, aware of the ridiculous but always amused, treating of subjects engrossing to both, are endearing indications of the sisters' deep attachment. Their affection surmounted their differing interests: Harriet's eldest son was to remark that his mother did not &#145;care a rap about politics&#146; while Lady Carlisle thought of &#145;nothing else&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.180).<br>
<br>With her mother's death in 1806, Lady Harriet's position at home became as unhappy as it was awkward. Lady Elizabeth Foster took over the direction of Devonshire House where she, the unmarried daughter, should have reigned. It was an invidious position: for three years she made the best of the absurdities and the vexations caused her by Lady Elizabeth. When it became apparent, in 1809, that the duke would shortly bestir himself into making his liaison lawful, Lady Bessborough set about finding a suitable husband for her niece. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16542/', "Lord Granville Leveson-Gower (1773&#150;1846)")</script> had for seventeen years been her own lover, with whom she had two children. None the less, she encouraged his courtship of her niece, who had known him all her life and had never cared much for him. Now she was captivated by this exceptionally handsome man, a member of parliament, who was intelligent and had every advantage of birth. The handkerchief was tossed in July, his proposal made in November, and she married him on 24 December 1809 and loved him to the end of her life. &#145;Granville, adored Granville, who would make a barren desert smile&#146;, she wrote. There were five children of this very happy marriage, including Georgiana [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10242/', "Fullerton, Lady Georgiana Charlotte")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16543/', "Granville George Leveson-Gower (1815&#150;1891)")</script>, second Earl Granville, the foreign secretary. The two illegitimate children of Lady Bessborough and Granville were absorbed into the family and loved. In 1815 a viscountcy for Granville, and in 1833 an earldom, gave Lady Granville the name by which she is most widely known. Perhaps the zenith of her days was reached when Lord Granville was appointed ambassador to France (in 1824&#150;8, in 1830&#150;35, and again in 1835&#150;41), where she acted as his hostess, entertaining the cosmopolitan Parisian society. Her fond descriptions of the Paris embassy house and the caustic accounts of daunting receptions, of people, of dress and manners make irresistible reading in the volumes of her letters published in 1894, 1940, and 1990.<br>
<br>Lord Granville died in 1846. In her desolation his widow turned to her brother, now the sixth duke, in the &#145;utter and hopeless breaking of my heart&#146;. Much of her time was spent at Chiswick finding a new consolation in evangelical piety. She died of a stroke on 25 November 1862 at her home, 13 Hereford Street, Park Lane, London.<br>
