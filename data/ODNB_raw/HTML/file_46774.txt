<span class="headword">Braithwaite,  Joseph Bevan</span>  (1855&#150;1934), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 5 October 1855 at 65 Mornington Road, Regent's Park, London, one of the three sons and six daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47051/', "Joseph Bevan Braithwaite (1818&#150;1905)")</script>, barrister, and his wife, Martha Gillett (1823&#150;1895), daughter of a Banbury banker. Both the Braithwaite and the Gillett families belonged to the Society of Friends which, over the century or so before Joseph's birth, had many members whose dedication to business enterprise, combined with marriages made almost exclusively within the group, gave them an influence far outweighing their numerical strength. Quaker families, to many of whom young Joseph was related, held dominant positions in financial institutions in the City of London, as well as in the banking, brewing, railway, iron and steel, and confectionery industries.<br>
<br>Joseph Braithwaite was educated at Quaker schools in Kendal (the Braithwaites had long been established there) and at Grove House, Tottenham, in north London, and he then began to read for the bar. However, in 1876 he changed direction and joined the City stockbroking firm of Foster and Braithwaite. Founded by Quakers in 1825, it was by the 1870s largely owned by its senior partner, Joseph's uncle, Isaac Braithwaite (1810&#150;1890). Isaac had provided for his succession within the firm, with the introduction of two of his sons, so that Joseph cannot have had great hopes of advancement when he joined; but the death of Alfred Braithwaite, one of Isaac's sons, created an opening in 1880 and Joseph became a partner at the age of twenty-five. In 1881 he married Anna Sophia Gillett, daughter of the banker Jonathon Gillett, a connection through his mother's family; they had two sons, Jonathon Frederick (1883&#150;1962) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46773/', "John Bevan Braithwaite (1884&#150;1973)")</script>.<br>
<br>In the 1880s Isaac Braithwaite's plans for the future direction of Foster and Braithwaite were blighted by what the firm's historian has described as a &#145;concatenation of death and dereliction of duty&#146;  (Reader, <span class="italic">A House in the City</span>, 92)&#151;that is, the premature death of Isaac's second son in the business in 1885 and the sudden departure of another partner, apparently guilty of embezzlement. As a result, when Isaac Braithwaite retired in 1888, Joseph Braithwaite succeeded him as senior partner.<br>
<br>Braithwaite's principal interests did not lie in stockbroking; indeed his obituarist in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> noted that he &#145;seldom entered the Stock Exchange&#146;  (1 Dec 1934). His skills lay rather with finance and its provision, and these were applied particularly in the last two decades of the nineteenth century, to the advantage of the new and rapidly developing electricity industry. Braithwaite's interest in electricity reflected a strong technical bent and an enthusiasm for engineering and scientific matters which lasted all his life; he had an astronomical observatory built on his house at Muswell Hill in north London.<br>
<br>It was on Braithwaite's recommendation that Foster and Braithwaite played a major part in the launch on the stock exchange in the early 1880s of the first electric-lighting companies, in the shape of the Anglo-American Brush Electric Light Corporation and its various satellite companies. Investing in electricity was at that time highly speculative, as the collapse after the stock market boom of 1882&#151;and the drop in Foster and Braithwaite's profits&#151;clearly evidenced. Joseph Braithwaite himself became chairman in 1882 of the Great Western Electric Power and Light Company, and he devoted considerable time to the development of generating stations at Bristol and Cardiff.<br>
<br>In the 1890s as head of the firm Braithwaite, assisted by his two partner cousins, Cecil Braithwaite and Ronald Savory, led the firm into company promotion on a much larger scale than ever before. Prominent among the companies that the firm promoted on the stock exchange, either by placing their shares or by underwriting them, were electrical undertakings. Braithwaite became a director of several companies which were financially and contractually linked, and he formed a connection which lasted for the rest of his life with the Electric and General Investment Corporation (established in 1890) and the City of London Electric Lighting Company (established in 1891); he became chairman of both of these in 1906 and remained so until 1934.<br>
<br>Braithwaite was elected a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1893 and he became a close associate of Emile Garcke (1856&#150;1930), an electrical engineer who played a significant part in the creation of the electricity supply industry. Equally significant was the role played by Braithwaite in providing finance for the new industry, and his ability to do so was underpinned by his position in Foster and Braithwaite.<br>
<br>The firm's activities in company promotion in other areas were less successful, and in the years leading up to 1914 unwise investments in such doubtful enterprises as the Piccadilly Hotel and the Kansas City, Mexico, and Orient Railway Company took Foster and Braithwaite close to disaster. Its survival was due to changes introduced by Braithwaite's younger son, John, who had become a partner in 1908, rather than to any initiative taken by the senior partner himself. Joseph Braithwaite remained the titular head of Foster and Braithwaite until he retired in 1922. He died on 30 November 1934 at his Somerset home, Blencathara, Sea View Road, Burnham-on-Sea.<br>
