</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brzeska,  Henri Alphonse S&eacute;raphin Marie  Gaudier-</span>  (1891&#150;1915), <span class="occ">sculptor and draughtsman</span>, was born on 4 October 1891 at Vomimbert, St Jean-de-Braye, on the outskirts of Orl&eacute;ans, France, the only son and eldest of the three children of Germain Gaudier (1864&#150;1934) and Marie-Alexandrine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bourgoin (1865&#150;1954). Both parents came from French artisan families, his father being a carpenter&#150;joiner and his maternal grandfather a wheelwright. In 1907 Gaudier's academic and linguistic ability won him a two-year state scholarship for study abroad, which he spent at the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in Bristol, and working for a coal exporter, Fifoot, Ching &amp; Co., in Cardiff, before travelling to Germany, where he stayed in Nuremberg and Munich. During this period he determined, though entirely self-taught, on an artistic career aiming at magazine illustration, though his efforts in this direction under the name G&eacute;rald proved unsuccessful.<br>
<br>On his return to France in September 1909, Gaudier worked briefly in Paris for a publisher, a lens manufacturer, and a textile firm while studying voraciously in the libraries and museums. He drew people, animals, and the urban scene, laying the basis of his rapid and immensely versatile draughtsmanship. In May 1910 he met Sophie Suzanne Brzeska (1871&#150;1925), a Polish woman who became his lifelong companion in a volatile but probably platonic relationship. They moved to London in January 1911, adopting the surname Gaudier-Brzeska and the identity of a Franco-Polish brother and sister to lend respectability to their cohabitation.<br>
<br>While employed from March 1911 to July 1913 as a foreign-language clerk with Wulfsberg &amp; Co., a timber importer in the City, Gaudier-Brzeska spent all his spare time studying in libraries, museums, and galleries and making work from clay, cut plaster, and bought, begged, or stolen offcuts of stone. Despite his job and Sophie's sporadic employment as a governess, they were scarcely able to make ends meet and led a penurious existence in a series of rented rooms in Chelsea and Fulham. During protracted separations they exchanged letters; this correspondence, of which only his side survives, and Sophie Brzeska's autobiographical writings (now at the Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Orl&eacute;ans, Cambridge University Library, and Essex University Library), provide vivid insights into their lives and thoughts.<br>
<br>During 1912 Gaudier-Brzeska began to establish himself as a sculptor, first in clay and then, probably from mid-1912, in stone, assimilating the influence of Rodin, fauvism, cubism, Brancusi, and examples of non-European art from China, Africa, and Oceania, in rapid succession; a fluidly modelled bronze, <span class="italic">Dancer</span> (1913, Tate collection), for which the painter Nina Hamnett modelled, preceded by only weeks an aggressively primitivistic carving in Mansfield stone, <span class="italic">Redstone Dancer</span> (1913, Tate collection). Stylistically eclectic but formally inventive and often savagely humorous, he had &#145;an amazing faculty for synthesis&#146;  (Pound, 7). His sculptures during 1912&#150;13 were primarily Rodinesque figure studies, including theatre, ballet, and wrestling subjects, and modelled portraits of friends, including the writer Enid Bagnold (1912, priv. coll.), the journalist Frank Harris (1913), and fellow artists Alfred Wolmark (1913) and Horace Brodzky (1913). Meeting Jacob Epstein in June 1912 confirmed his interest in direct carving which increasingly took over but never entirely superseded modelling in his working practice. Animal and bird studies remained a favourite theme evolving from quick zoo sketches to the semi-geometric primitivism of <span class="italic">Stags</span> (alabaster, 1914, Art Institute of Chicago) and <span class="italic">Bird Swallowing a Fish</span> (plaster, 1914, Kettle's Yard, Cambridge) and the intuitive cubism of <span class="italic">Birds Erect</span> (limestone, 1914, Museum of Modern Art, New York). However, despite his self-conscious modernism, he could still draw inspiration from the classical tradition, as seen in his small marble <span class="italic">Torso</span> (1913, Tate collection), <span class="italic">Maternity</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">Seated Woman</span> (1914, both Mus&eacute;e National d'Art Moderne, Paris).<br>
<br>During 1913&#150;14, working from a comfortless studio, first at 454A Fulham Road (January to September 1913) and then Arch 25, Winthorpe Road, Putney, Gaudier-Brzeska became an increasingly prominent figure within the London avant-garde, especially after beginning to exhibit his sculpture at the London Salon in July 1913. There he met the American poet Ezra Pound, to whom his slight, sinewy figure appeared &#145;like a well-made young wolf or some soft-moving, bright-eyed wild thing&#146;  (Pound, 45). His friendly relationships with a wide range of artists within otherwise mutually antipathetic groups&#151;Roger Fry's Grafton Group and Omega workshop artists, Camden Town artists such as Harold Gilman and Robert Bevan, as well as Wyndham Lewis and his circle&#151;were indicative both of his eclecticism and of the respect which his talent and sharply critical intelligence commanded. He was elected to the London Group in February 1914 and was chosen as chairman of the artists' committee for the 1914 London Salon. However, he sold few sculptures and received only a handful of small private commissions.<br>
<br>Through his friendship with Pound, Gaudier-Brzeska became increasingly identified with the nascent vorticist group during 1914 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64450/', "Vorticists")</script>]. His sculptures, whether large like the so-called <span class="italic">Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound</span> (1914, R. Nasher Collection, USA), commissioned by the poet himself, or very small like the carved metal <span class="italic">Torpedo Fish</span> (1914, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto) and <span class="italic">Doorknocker</span> (1914, Kettle's Yard, Cambridge), take on increasingly sharp-edged, geometric, and abstract forms in keeping with the vorticists' virile, machine age aesthetic. He was one of the signatories of the vorticist manifesto and contributed two seminal articles, &#145;Vortex&#151;Gaudier-Brzeska&#146;, to the 1914 and 1915 issues of <span class="italic">Blast</span>. In these he revealed literary gifts and an impressive grasp of the history of sculpture. His opening statement,<blockquote>
<div>Sculptural energy is the mountain.<br>
</div>
<div>Sculptural feeling is the appreciation of masses in relation.<br>
</div>
<div>Sculptural ability is the defining of these masses by planes.<br>
</div> (<span class="roman">Gaudier-Brzeska</span>, 1.155)</blockquote>became a rallying call for modern British sculpture, influencing Henry Moore and Frank Dobson among others.<br>
<br>In September 1914 Gaudier-Brzeska returned to France and enlisted as a private in the 129th regiment of the French army, serving in the Craonne sector near Rheims. Twice promoted&#151;to corporal and sergeant&#151;he was due for officer training when he was killed by a single bullet through the head on 5 June 1915 at Neuville-St Vaast in Artois and was buried in the military cemetery there.<br>
<br>Sophie Brzeska inherited his work by an <i>inter vivos</i> gift; on her death, insane and intestate, in 1925, it was valued at &pound;545. The enthusiasm of artists and the publication of Pound's <span class="italic">Gaudier-Brzeska: a Memoir</span> (1916) and H. S. Ede's <span class="italic">Savage Messiah</span> (1931) led to a growing appreciation of his catalytic role in the birth of modernist sculpture in Britain but he remained until the late 1950s virtually unknown in his native country. His life with Sophie Brzeska, as told by Ede, acquired mythic status, notably in Ken Russell's film <span class="italic">Savage Messiah</span> (1971), but as early as 1934 their relationship was the acknowledged inspiration for the artist and writer protagonists in <span class="italic">The Laughing Woman</span>, a play by Elizabeth Mackintosh writing under the name of Gordon Daviot.<br>
