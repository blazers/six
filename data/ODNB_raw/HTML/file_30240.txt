<span class="headword">Yorke,  Charles Philip</span>, fourth earl of Hardwicke  (1799&#150;1873), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30244/', "Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke (1768&#150;1831)")</script>, naval officer, and his first wife, Elizabeth Weake (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of James Rattray, was born at Sydney Lodge, Hamble, Hampshire, on 2 April 1799. After three years at Harrow School, he entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth in February 1813, and, having passed with credit, was in May 1815 appointed midshipman to the <i>Prince</i>, flagship at Spithead. From her he moved to the <i>Leviathan</i>, and from there to the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, in which he was present at the bombardment of Algiers. He was then sent to the <i>Leander</i>, flagship of Sir David Milne, on the North American station, and on 14 August 1819 was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Pha&euml;ton</i>. On 18 May 1822 he was made commander, and in August 1823 was appointed to the <i>Alacrity</i> which he took out to the Mediterranean, where he was engaged in suppressing piracy. On 6 June 1825 he was promoted captain, and from 1828 to 1831 commanded the <i>Alligator</i> in the Mediterranean, mostly in Greek waters.<br>
<br>Yorke was tory MP for the family seats of Reigate (1831&#150;2), and Cambridgeshire (1832&#150;4).<br>
<br>On 4 October 1833 Yorke married Susan (1810&#150;1886), sixth daughter of Thomas Henry Liddell, first Baron Ravensworth; among their eight children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61075/', "Charles Philip Yorke, fifth earl of Hardwicke (1836&#150;1897)")</script>, father of Albert Edward Yorke, sixth earl of Hardwicke. On the death of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30248/', "Philip Yorke, third earl of Hardwicke")</script>, on 18 November 1834, Yorke succeeded to the title, and became lord lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. In the Peel administration of 1841 he was one of the lords-in-waiting, resigning in 1846 to oppose the repeal of the corn laws. He also served at sea, in command of the Admiralty steam yacht <i>Black Eagle</i>, and attended the king of Prussia and tsar of Russia, both of whom he visited in their own capitals. In 1844 Hardwicke commanded the battleship <i>St Vincent</i> for an experimental cruise. In 1848 he took command of the battleship <i>Vengeance</i>. His firm action while stationed at Genoa in April 1849 secured the city for the king of Sardinia, for which service he was decorated. Shortly afterwards he resigned his commission because of his wife's ill health.<br>
<br>In 1852 Hardwicke became postmaster-general in Lord Derby's brief administration. On 12 January 1854 he reached the rank of rear-admiral, and was placed on the retired list, lacking sufficient sea service as a captain for active duty. Despite this, Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Napier twice requested that he be appointed to the Baltic fleet, but the cabinet refused to restore him to active duty. From 1858 to 1859 Hardwicke served as lord privy seal, and chairman of the royal commission on manning. Although he was a close personal friend of Lord Derby, Hardwicke's ill health precluded service in the 1867 cabinet. He died at Sydney Lodge, Hamble, Hampshire, on 17 September 1873 and was buried at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, near Royston, on 24 September.<br>
<br>Hardwicke was admired by all who knew him, as a seaman, a politician and a landowner. He had many virtues, but his direct and honest approach was less successful in politics than it had been at sea.<br>
