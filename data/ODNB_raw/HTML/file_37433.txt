<span class="headword">Freeth,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Free]</span>  (1731&#150;1808), <span class="occ">innkeeper and political ballad writer</span>, was born at the Bell tavern, Philip Street, Birmingham, the son of Charles Freeth, landlord of the Bell, and his wife, Mary. Nothing is known of Freeth's education or of his early years, although it seems that he was once an itinerant street ballad singer. Where and when Freeth married is not known. His wife's name was Sarah and she was five years his junior. By 1768 John Freeth had become landlord of the Leicester Arms, on the corner of Bell Street and Lease Lane, Birmingham, where he remained until his death in 1808. Freeth's Coffee House, as the Leicester Arms was known, became one of the most celebrated taverns in England, and Freeth became known as &#145;the Birmingham poet&#146;.<br>
<br>It was Freeth's custom to write songs&#151;setting his words to popular tunes&#151;about remarkable events in local and national news, and to sing them nightly to the company assembled at his coffee house. The habit was profitable: it crowded the place with patrons, attracted eminent visitors, and, since Freeth wrote as a determined radical and nonconformist, created a political meeting-place. The interest aroused by his songs encouraged Freeth to publish them, and the words of nearly 400 songs appeared in more than a dozen collections between 1766 and 1805; John Baskerville (1706&#150;1775) was among his printers. The most substantial of these collections was <span class="italic">The Political Songster</span> (1790).<br>
<br>Freeth usually sang about feats of war, national emergencies, and affairs of state, such as the victories of Earl Howe and Lord Nelson, and the activities of Charles James Fox, Lord North, and William Pitt. To those ballads he added a substantial leavening of others that were complimentary, jocular, and satirical. Although unsophisticated, many of his patriotic songs have a stirring lilt; on politics he wrote with indignation, rough good humour, and an effective turn of phrase that earned him the reputation of being one of the best political ballad writers in the kingdom. From 1771 until 1785 Freeth used the pen-name John Free in punning allusion to his beliefs. His songs offer a significant insight into the popular politics of the late eighteenth century.<br>
<br>To draw attention to the hospitality provided at his inn Freeth issued printed invitation cards, written in verse. In some fifteen lines, he extends his invitation, comments forcefully on an item of news, and indicates the fare offered. With these cards Freeth originated an unusual, possibly unique, kind of trade card.<br>
<br>In late Georgian Birmingham, Freeth was an outstanding figure, respected for his probity and the warmth of his friendships. A notable group portrait was painted by Johann Eckstein entitled <span class="italic">John Freeth and his Circle</span> (1792). Freeth died, possibly of Paget's disease, in Birmingham on 29 September 1808, and was buried at the Old Meeting-House, Birmingham. He was subsequently reinterred at Witton cemetery, Birmingham, in 1882. His wife, Sarah, died on 25 November 1807. Of their nine children, one son and seven daughters were mentioned in Freeth's will.<br>
