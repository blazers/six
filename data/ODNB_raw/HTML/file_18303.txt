<span class="headword">Massie,  Joseph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">writer on trade and economics</span>, was of unknown origins. Likewise it is not known if he married or had children. Several of his early writings exhibit an in-depth familiarity and interested concern with the West Indian sugar trade which suggests that he was a merchant or factor in this branch of business for some years. In the 1750s he began to establish a reputation as a writer, statistician, and economic theorist. During the Seven Years' War and its aftermath he was particularly active as a pamphleteer in support of, and probably in the pay of, William Pitt. Possibly he entertained hopes of a post as a Treasury civil servant or as an official historian of commerce. One of Massie's chief claims to fame is as a bibliographer of economics. Between 1748 and 1764 he formed an unprecedented collection and a catalogue of books and pamphlets on trade and commerce dating back to 1557. He hoped that this collection would provide a resource for the development of economic theory as a science, and for the training of students in the theory and practice of trade. He attempted unsuccessfully to persuade either the City of London or the government to buy this collection and make it the centrepiece of a projected academy of commerce. The indexed catalogue of this collection and other works on economics, last updated in 1764 and then listing more than 2400 titles, is to be found among the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Library. Later in life Massie became bitter at the repeated rejection of his schemes and advances for patronage; his publications and memorandums then became cranky and paranoid.<br>
<br>Massie's name has been linked with a pioneering work of economic theory published anonymously as <span class="italic">An Essay on the Governing Causes of the Natural Rate of Interest</span> (1750), but the evidence of authorship is unclear (most of Massie's later writings were signed). This work argued that the natural rate of interest was regulated by the profits of trade rather than by the amount of circulating money as John Locke and other writers had previously assumed. Massie's approach to economics was profoundly shaped by his reading of economic literature as it had developed since the sixteenth century as well as his own experience of trade. He bemoaned the fact that &#145;some writers have considered commerce as a science, and endeavoured to deduce the knowledge of it from axioms and maxims &amp;c. while many others have treated it as a branch of history, and given narratives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Representation</span>, preface) and that there was little consensus on first principles, and his ambition was to unite the historical and the scientific-deductive approaches to the subject of economics. In pursuance of this goal he planned but did not complete a detailed history of British trade divided into its separate branches which he hoped would facilitate the formulation of general maxims. This project was influenced by the Baconian intellectual tradition and the methods of the Royal Society. Although the next generation of political economists preferred to use more abstract and systematic models of the economy, Massie's essay may still be considered one of the more interesting attempts at generating a unified body of economics prior to the work of Adam Smith.<br>
<br>Commerce for Massie was an essential art and he hoped that the subject would soon become an accepted component of a liberal education. These views were stated most clearly in his <span class="italic">Representation Concerning the Knowledge of Commerce as a National Concern</span> (1760). Massie also continued to pursue the statistical work begun by the political arithmeticians and produced several interesting calculations on population, social structure, consumption, and taxation. The most significant of these productions first arose from a polemical broadside against the sugar planters whose title is a pr&eacute;cis of its argument: <span class="italic">A computation of the money that hath been exorbitantly raised upon the people of Great Britain by the sugar planters &hellip; shewing how much money a family of each rank, degree or class hath lost by that rapacious monopoly</span> (1760). One of the work's most interesting elements is a tabular representation of English and Welsh social structure and income distribution based on the returns of the hearth-tax and his own estimates. Similar material is also contained in his <span class="italic">Calculations of Taxes for a Family of each Rank, Degree or Class</span> (1756). These have proved useful resources for modern social and economic historians.<br>
<br>For most of his career as a writer Massie lived in Covent Garden, London. He died on 1 November 1784 and was buried on 7 November at St Andrew's, Holborn.<br>
