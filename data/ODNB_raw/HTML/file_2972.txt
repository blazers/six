<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boucher,  Jonathan</span>  (1738&#150;1804), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 12 March 1738 in Cumberland to James Boucher, schoolmaster and manager of an alehouse, and Anne Barnes, both descendants of Norman aristocracy whose family had fallen on hard times. Although a poor businessman, Boucher's publican father taught him to read at the age of three. His unlettered mother was an efficient household manager who kept Boucher and his siblings just out of poverty and enabled Jonathan to study in the Revd Joseph Blaine's school in Wigdon. In 1756 he secured a teaching post in a school in St Bees run by John and Anne James, who became his mentors and surrogate older siblings.<br>
<br>The Jameses encouraged Boucher to accept a teaching position in Maryland in 1759 as a tutor for the sons of a Virginia merchant, John Younger. In 1761 he returned to London to secure ordination, which he received on 17 January 1762. In July 1762 he became rector of the Hanover parish, Virginia, and in November 1763 accepted a more attractive position in St Mary's parish, Caroline county, Virginia, where he realized his ambition to be a planter as well as a teacher and cleric.<br>
<br>After lengthy manoeuvring Boucher secured appointment to the fashionable parish of St Anne in Maryland in May 1770. In 1771 he married Eleanor (Nelly) Addison (<i>d</i>. 1784), the niece of his patron in Maryland, Henry Addison. Addison's patronage made Boucher an intimate of Governor William Eden and chaplain to the Maryland assembly. In 1773 he took the administration's side in a dispute between the governor and anti-proprietary leaders Samuel Chase and William Paca over clerical salaries. Boucher demolished the anti-proprietary case by demonstrating the historic ecclesiastical supremacy of the Maryland proprietors. &#145;Uncharitable priest,&#146; Paca and Chase blurted in angry frustration, &#145;what passion dictated your resentment against us? Was it laudable zeal for the public welfare or was it revenge?&#146;  (Calhoon, 223).<br>
<br>It was the central question about Boucher's politics and churchmanship. His transformation from a marginal emigrant in 1759 into an incisive polemicist in 1773 revealed the dependence of the Maryland proprietary regime on maintenance of a cosmopolitan veneer and political operatives willing to expose anti-proprietary republicanism. As tutor to George Washington's hapless stepson Jackie Custis from 1768 to 1773 Boucher took the measure of both the Virginia planter and Chesapeake society. He told Washington that Jackie was &#145;teeming with all the softer virtues&#146;&#151;&#145;the harmlessness of a dove&#146; without &#145;the wisdom of the serpent&#146;. &#145;How will you forgive me&#146;, he asked Washington, &#145;should I suffer him to lose in gentleness, simplicity, and inoffensiveness as much as he gains in address, prudence, and resolution? &hellip; a dilemma by no means easily avoided&#146;  (Calhoon, 226).<br>
<br>Acting on similar cultural assumptions Boucher laid down his challenge to the American War of Independence. On 20 July 1775, the day set apart by the continental congress for prayer and fasting in support of the American cause, Boucher faced a congregation of 200 armed men in the St Anne's parish church when he attempted to preach on obedience to the magistrate as a religious duty. Armed patriots in the church attempted to force Boucher to leave. Thinking to himself that &#145;once to flinch was forever to invite danger&#146;, Boucher drew his own loaded pistol and, pointing it directly at the head of the leader of the protesters, led a subdued procession out of the church. The next day he returned and without incident preached on <span class="roman">Galatians</span> 5: 1 (&#145;Stand fast then in the liberty wherein Christ has made us free&#146;). That passage, Boucher declared, could not, &#145;without infinite perversion and torture&#146;, be &#145;made to refer to any other kind of liberty&#146; (Calhoon, 230; Bailyn, 315). The very idea of associating Christianity with political radicalism, he suggested, had originated in Judas's politically inspired betrayal of Jesus. The 1797 published text of Boucher's sermon invoked Robert Filmer's doctrine of the divine right of kings to exercise patriarchal authority over their subjects. If Boucher did inject Filmer into the pre-revolutionary controversy, he would have been the only American loyalist to do so. The stronger likelihood is that Boucher added Filmerian patriarchalism to his conservatism during the 1790s in response to the extremism of the French Revolution, and accordingly revised his 1775 sermon just before its publication.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1775 Boucher fled from Maryland, and sailed for England on 22 September. He and Nelly settled in Paddington where he resumed teaching and took into the household John and Anne James's sons, Thomas and John, for whom the Bouchers became surrogate parents, repaying an old emotional debt. He was rector of Paddington from 1776 to 1785, and was appointed the assistant secretary to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in 1779. Nelly died in March 1784. In January 1785 he became vicar of Epsom parish in Surrey. Boucher was married twice more&#151;first on 15 February 1787 to Mary Elizabeth Foreman (<i>d</i>. 1788), and on 29 October 1789 to Elizabeth Hodgson, who survived him. Among his children was the religious writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2974/', "Barton Bouchier (1795&#150;1865)")</script>. Yearning to become a bishop, Boucher sought unsuccessfully in 1793&#150;4 to effect a merger of the Scottish Episcopal church with Anglican splinter churches in Scotland. During the last years of his life he devoted himself to producing a lexicographical history of the English language. He died on 27 April 1804 in Cumberland and was buried in Epsom churchyard on 4 May.<br>
