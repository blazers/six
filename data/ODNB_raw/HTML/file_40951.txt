<span class="headword">Davies,  Benjamin Grey <span class="st"> [Ben]</span></span>  (1858&#150;1943), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 6 January 1858 in Pontardawe, near Swansea, the eldest son of an engineer who died when the boy was seven. Having learned to read music by the tonic sol-fa system, he sang alto in choirs competing in eisteddfodau, and in Caradoc's Choir at the Crystal Palace. His voice broke when he was fifteen, and he worked as a shop assistant in Swansea until he won first prize at the 1877 Swansea eisteddfod. This enabled him to study at the Royal Academy of Music with Fiori and Randegger (1878&#150;80), where he won the Evill Prize. A student success in Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Hymn of Praise</span> led to an engagement to sing the tenor solo in <span class="italic">St Paul</span> in Dublin, while another student performance, in Gounod's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, resulted in his operatic d&eacute;but at Birmingham on 11 October 1881, with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, as Thaddeus in Balfe's <span class="italic">The Bohemian Girl</span>; in 1885 he married Clara Perry, a soprano in the company. He continued to sing small parts, notably in J. W. Turner's company.<br>
<br>Davies's first leading part came on 20 December 1886 at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London as Geoffrey Wilder in Alfred Cellier's <span class="italic">Dorothy</span>. By now he was one of the rising stars among English tenors, beginning to succeed Edward Lloyd and Sims Reeves in public affections. He went on to sing the title role in the premi&egrave;re (31 January 1891) and on alternate nights of the opening run of Sullivan's <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>, at &pound;70 for four performances a week, according to the composer's diary. In 1891 he also sang Cl&eacute;ment Marot in Messager's <span class="italic">La Basoche</span>, and the following year performed with Augustus Harris's company. Thereafter he turned his attention increasingly to oratorio, both in Britain (Cardiff Festival, 1892, in Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's <span class="italic">Stabat mater</span>) and in America (where he made his d&eacute;but at the 1893 Chicago World Fair); he returned to America almost annually. He made his Covent Garden d&eacute;but on 25 July 1892 as Gounod's Faust. His many festival appearances included those at Norwich (1893&#150;6), Leeds (1895), and Bristol (1896). He sang in Berlin in 1894. Davies was always a particularly welcome guest in his native Wales, where he sang at eisteddfodau, notably in Joseph Parry's oratorio <span class="italic">Saul of Tarsus</span> at Rhyl in 1892. In 1916 he became vice-president of the newly formed Society of English Singers. His fine natural gifts, which included an attractive timbre and clear enunciation, disciplined by an excellent technique, enabled him to continue his career well into his sixties. In the 1920s he participated in Albani's benefit at Covent Garden (25 May 1925) and at the Handel Festival (1926). He died at Clifton Court, Clifton Hill, Bristol, Gloucestershire, on 28 March 1943.<br>
