<span class="headword">Stanhope <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wotton; <em>other married name </em>van der Kerckhove]</span>,  Katherine</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Chesterfield, and Lady Stanhope  (<em>bap. </em>1609, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was baptized on 19 December 1609, the eldest daughter and coheir with her three sisters of Thomas Wotton, second Baron Wotton of Marley in Kent (<i>c</i>.1588&#150;1630) and Mary Throckmorton (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Sir Arthur Throckmorton of Paulerspury, Northamptonshire. Sir Henry Wotton was her uncle and Carew Raleigh her mother's first cousin.<h2>
<a name="Firstmarriage"></a>First marriage</h2>On 4 December 1628 Katherine Wotton married Sir Henry Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1634), styled Lord Stanhope, second, but first surviving, son and heir apparent of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26252/', "Philip Stanhope, first earl of Chesterfield")</script>, and his first wife, Catherine Hastings. Lord Stanhope was MP for Nottinghamshire in 1626 and for East Retford in 1628&#150;9. They had three children, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 7 October 1629 at Boughton Malherbe in Kent, where the Wotton estates were), Catherine, and Philip (<i>b</i>. 1633) as well as a son, Wotton, who died in infancy, being buried on 27 December 1632. Lord Stanhope himself died at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 29 November 1634, and was buried at Boughton Malherbe on 2 December. Following his father's death Philip became a royal ward, and Lady Stanhope was obliged to pay &pound;2000 for the grant of the wardship to herself, money which she claimed later to have had to borrow after her husband died in debt and her father-in-law refused to help her. Relations with the earl appear to have been generally poor, since he petitioned against her in 1636 for her refusal to pay ship money of &pound;30 (assessed on Chesterfield lands which provided her annual jointure of &pound;1000), which had then been claimed from his tenants. Lady Stanhope divided her time during the 1630s between her children in Boughton Malherbe and London, where she had a house in Covent Garden. A gossipy letter from Edward, Lord Conway, to Sir Thomas Wentworth in January 1637 provides a glimpse of her active social life, as well as suggesting a tendency to be careful with money. Rumour had it that Lord Cottington wanted to marry her, but that she was in love with Carew Raleigh; Van Dyck had also engaged in &#145;gallantries&#146; with her until they argued about the cost of her portrait, which he threatened to sell to a higher bidder.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriageandentryintoroyalservice"></a>Second marriage and entry into royal service</h2>Lady Stanhope's second husband, however, did not come from the English court. In 1639 Jehan van der Kerckhove (1594&#150;1660), lord of Heenvliet, made his first visit to England with instructions to sound out the king on a possible marriage between William, the son of Frederick Henry, prince of Orange, and one of Charles's daughters. Heenvliet, son of the theologian Jehan Poliander van der Kerckhove, was married with three daughters, Anne (<i>b</i>. 1620), Walburg (<i>b</i>. 1626), and Willemine (<i>b</i>. 1629). He returned to England in January 1640 with formal proposals for a match between William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18252/', "Princess Mary (1631&#150;1660)")</script>, though he went back to the Netherlands in April for the marriage of his daughter Anne; his first wife, Anne de Wesick, seems also to have died at about this time. His wooing of Lady Stanhope, while obviously rapid, did not go entirely smoothly: back once again in the Netherlands in the autumn he complained that malicious slanderers were attempting to delay their marriage by telling her that he was &#145;issu d'un lieu obscur, et d'une race vulgaire&#146;. Moreover, in marrying a foreigner any children from the marriage would have no inheritance rights in England, and if she predeceased him all her property in England would be forfeit to the crown. His confidant &#145;Louis de Dieu&#146; wrote a long letter to James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh, with full details of Heenvliet's lineage, honours, and virtues, and asked him to reassure &#145;ceste tres noble Dame&#146; as to the worth of her intended husband  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 559, fols. 45&#150;51). With Charles I also giving support to the marriage Lady Stanhope's reservations were overcome, and in early 1641 they were married; a set of epithalamia was printed for the occasion at Leiden in March. Heenvliet was evidently trusted by the king, who appointed him superintendent of Mary's household, while Lady Stanhope was to take over from Lady Roxburgh as Mary's governess. Her appointment was not universally popular, the marquess of Hamilton lobbying hard for his mother-in-law Lady Denbigh, and Mary herself was initially distressed by the change, to the extent of causing a public scene in early October 1642 when Lady Roxburgh took leave of her in The Hague, where they had arrived in March. It is evident, however, that she soon transferred her affections to Lady Stanhope, to whom she remained strongly attached for the rest of her life, as she did to Heenvliet.<br>
<br>The early months of Lady Stanhope's governess-ship coincided with her own pregnancy, &#145;un Enfant si gros et gras&#146; being born on 9 May 1643  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 95, fol. 103). His parents intended to name him Thomas after his grandfather, with Lady Wotton and Poliander as godparents, but after Princess Mary and her father-in-law, Frederick Henry, prince of Orange, proposed themselves for this role he was baptized with the more regal name <a href="#cosubject_15670">Charles Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Initially Lady Stanhope's duties consisted largely of looking after Mary's wardrobe and carrying out small errands for her, but more difficult issues also arose. Although education does not feature significantly in the concerns voiced in her letters she came into conflict with John Durie, the princess's chaplain and tutor, who offended her by proposing &#145;une Id&eacute;e Platonique&#146; for Mary's instruction  (ibid., fol. 134). Much more important, though, was her superintendence of Mary's sexual development. Lady Stanhope had promised Charles I that she would not allow the marriage, which had taken place on 2 May 1641, to be consummated before Mary was fourteen, and stationed an attendant to sleep in her room to prevent it. The discovery in February 1644 that the princess's nurse had enabled William to sneak into her bedroom after Mrs Abercrombie was asleep, &#145;where he lay with hir Hignise all night&#146;, alarmed Lady Stanhope, with both the nurse and attendant suffering &#145;assez picquantes paroles&#146; from her. On discovering that his action had the support of his parents, she was silenced; and, as Heenvliet commented, &#145;il n'y a rem&egrave;de, &amp; ils ont depuis continu&eacute;&#146;  (ibid., fols. 135&#150;6). Thereafter, Henrietta Maria and the princess of Orange both waited impatiently for news from Lady Stanhope of Mary's pregnancy, though, as she told the queen, it was not until early 1647 that Mary began to menstruate. By the time Mary gave birth shortly after the death of her husband in 1650, Lady Stanhope had become indispensable to her, unable even to send the news herself to Henrietta Maria because the princess did not wish &#145;qu'elle la quitte d'un pas&#146;  (ibid., fol. 350). In the meantime, Lady Stanhope herself had given birth again to a daughter, Amelie (or Emilia) Willemine, born on 31 May 1646. Soon afterwards, in September, Heenvliet's daughter Walburg married Thomas Howard, Princess Mary's master of the horse, becoming one of the ladies of her bedchamber and later governess to William, prince of Orange, but it seems likely that his daughter Willemine had died in 1645, when an elegy representing her as one of the three graces lamented the death of his young daughter (called here Magdalena). Of Lady Stanhope's children, Mary (&#145;Mall&#146;) had been left in England with Lady Wotton, but Philip and Catherine were brought up in the Netherlands, where &#145;Tatty&#146; became a favourite maid of honour to the princess.<br>
<br>The birth of an heir had concentrated Heenvliet's mind on the issue of inheritance raised prior to his marriage to Lady Stanhope, and over the course of the next decade and a half the couple put considerable effort into ensuring that neither he nor Charles Henry would suffer any disadvantage from their Dutch nationality. In 1642 Charles I offered Heenvliet not only English denization but also a peerage by reviving the barony of Wotton; realizing that the peerage would make both himself and his children foreigners in the Netherlands, Heenvliet asked for the barony to be conferred instead on any future son. This aim, along with the protection of Lady Stanhope's English estates, he pursued single-mindedly almost to the moment of Charles I's removal from the Isle of Wight to Hurst Castle. So it was that in November 1648 Charles issued a warrant concerning the estate of Katherine, Lady Stanhope, disclaiming any crown interest in her property. Their grief at his execution did not prevent them from taking action to secure their position: in June 1649 Charles II issued a virtually identical warrant, as well as one creating &#145;Charles Henry de Kerckhoven&#146; Baron Wotton of Marley; a formal patent for the latter was signed by the king on 31 August 1650 in St Johnston.<h2>
<a name="Politicalantagonisms"></a>Political antagonisms</h2>This is not to suggest that Lady Stanhope and her husband were motivated entirely by self-interest, though there were those who thought so, most notably Sir Edward Nicholas, who was consistently and wholly hostile to them both. Lady Stanhope made herself unpopular in the Netherlands by her outspoken criticism of the amount of support being given to Charles I; her property was threatened with sequestration in 1644 because of her &#145;grandes intelligences &amp; correspondences d'Estat avec la Royne&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 95, fol. 136), and in the same year she underwrote an arms deal to prevent it from falling through. Despite this Nicholas suspected that she was ready to compromise, or worse, with the parliamentary authorities in order to save her estates. In September 1651 she learned that the Chesterfield lands, sequestrated owing to the engagement of the first earl in the war, would be sold off if his heir, her son Philip (then travelling in Italy), was not in London to compound for them personally by the end of December. After attempts to contact Philip failed she went to London herself, where she was immediately arrested, as having &#145;come &hellip; to carry on designs to the prejudice of the peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1651&#150;2</i>, 547). She was freed after two weeks and stayed in England until June, by which time she had secured the Chesterfield estate for her son at a cost of &pound;20,000. Soon after her return Nicholas wrote to Sir Edward Hyde with a serious accusation against her (exactly what is not clear from Hyde's reply), which he passed on to Charles II without revealing his source. The king reluctantly wrote to his sister to warn her against her favourite, eliciting a furious reply and a demand to know the author &#145;of this malicious fals report&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 115, fol. 194). Her chief suspect was her mother-in-law, the dowager princess of Orange, with whom she had consistently poor relations, for which Lady Stanhope was held partially responsible by the Dutch. The perception of her influence as damaging was shared by Hyde and Nicholas, who saw her and Heenvliet's support for the views of the &#145;Louvre&#146; faction led by Henrietta Maria and Henry Jermyn as inimical to royalist interests in the Netherlands. Lady Stanhope rode out the storm seemingly undamaged. By 1654 she had won round Hyde by favours to his wife and daughter Anne; he defended her strongly to Nicholas when the latter renewed his accusation (adding, for good measure, a scurrilous rumour about Lady Stanhope's relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20768/', "Daniel O'Neill (c.1612&#150;1664)")</script> one of her closest associates). Hyde also asserted that &#145;Henfleete doth some good things in the dark&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 477, fol. 296). It appears to have taken rather longer for her to regain Charles's trust, but she evidently did so. In 1655, when both he and Princess Mary were in Cologne, she and her husband were among a select group of attendants who joined them and Henry, duke of Gloucester, on a widely reported incognito trip down the Rhine (during which &#145;there was no State or distinction among them &hellip; to make the more merry&#146;) to the fair at Frankfurt  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 280, 18&#150;25 Oct 1655). Lady Stanhope's refusal to accompany her mistress on her politically sensitive visit to Paris in 1656, despite Charles's desire that she should do so, was forgiven by him with the assurance that his friendship was &#145;better grounded then to be in the least degree shaken by a much greater occasion then this&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. lett. 115, fol. 117).<br>
<br>The purchase of the Chesterfield property brought its own problems. Lady Stanhope had already experienced a family dispute over money when her mother demanded in 1649 that she should put the sums allocated for portions for Mary and Catherine in her own hands, in cash. However, according to Lady Stanhope, the land from which she had intended to raise the money for their portions had to be sold to buy the Chesterfield estate, the income from which made Philip independent of his mother and enabled him to marry Anne Percy, daughter of the earl of Northumberland, in 1652. Following Anne's death in 1654 Philip brought a lawsuit against his mother whose details are unclear, but which seems to have been connected to the money reserved for his sisters, and possibly also to the terms of his marriage contract, since the case also involved Northumberland. Lady Stanhope countered by claiming all the expenditure she had laid out on him since his father's death, while sending heartfelt pleas for assistance and sympathy to any friend or relation she thought might help her. The dispute dragged on through the whole of the 1650s, being finally resolved in 1659, when the old accusations against Lady Stanhope's and Heenvliet's readiness to co-operate with the protectorate for their own ends were revived after they visited England to negotiate with Philip, now second earl of Chesterfield. They were accused by royalist opponents of being willing to accept the Wotton barony and denization from Richard Cromwell, a charge vehemently denied by Heenvliet, as he did the still more serious charge of providing information to secretary of state John Thurloe.<br>
<br>This suspicion seems ironic in view of the close watch kept by Thurloe's informants on Lady Stanhope. The extent of her political involvement only occasionally becomes clear, her own surviving letters being largely limited to family affairs and the princess's state of health, though Heenvliet's references to her suggest a greater influence over the affairs of Mary's court than the organization of her wardrobe. A letter from O'Neill to Hyde in May 1659 reporting on what Lady Stanhope had learned from informers in London (including Sir Robert Honeywood) provides the clearest evidence that Thurloe was right to be suspicious of her. O'Neill obviously felt that her knowledge of both parliamentary and royalist factions should be taken seriously. Her unique access to Mary provided an additional reason for listening to her, offering the possibility of averting or controlling incipient problems. In the same letter O'Neill tells Hyde of the princess's potential rebellion against Charles II for his interference in her relationship with the younger Henry Jermyn. Her declaration to Lady Stanhope that &#145;shee was a free woman, and might mary or have kindnes for whome shee pleased without demanding any boddys leave. that shee would not deny shee gave way &amp; was pleased with hery jermins love&#146; was worrying enough for O'Neill to pass it over to Hyde's and Ormond's consideration as to whether the king should be informed  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 60, fols. 517&#150;19).<h2>
<a name="Finalmarriageandfinalyears"></a>Final marriage and final years</h2>Heenvliet did not live to see the success of his efforts on his own and his son's behalf, dying on 10 March 1660 in the Netherlands, where Lady Stanhope raised a marble monument to him in the Pieterskerk in Leiden. The king's recognition of her services to himself and his sister won her a reward of her own: on 29 May, the day he arrived in London, she was created countess of Chesterfield for life. During the following weeks she sailed for the last time to England to prepare for the arrival of the princess of Orange in September. These were the last months of her long service: Mary died on 24 December. The only attendants named in her will were Lady Stanhope and Walburg Howard, to each of whom she left &pound;500. Although Mary was too heavily in debt for most of her legacies to be paid, Lady Stanhope, to whom she had owed a considerable sum, apparently refused to give back some of the princess's jewellery until she received her legacy, as well as keeping Mary's wardrobe as her perquisite. From this time she made her life in England, along with her two children from her marriage to Heenvliet, whose naturalization was approved in August 1660, though Charles Henry (now officially Baron Wotton) divided his time between England and the Netherlands. Lady Stanhope was reconciled to her son Philip, but all her daughters died: Mary, according to Philip's memoir, of smallpox about 1660, Catherine (married to William, second Lord Alington) in childbirth in 1662, and Emilia in 1663. She continued in royal service, becoming an attendant to the duchess of York soon after Mary's death, and being admitted as lady of the bedchamber to the queen in 1663.<br>
<br>Despite her frequent complaints about her financial state, at the Restoration the countess of Chesterfield was already a wealthy woman, retaining her estate in Boughton Malherbe and her house in Covent Garden. This fortunate position was only improved by her marriage, some time before October 1662, to her old friend Daniel O'Neill, who had been well rewarded by Charles II for his loyalty. It was for her that O'Neill built Belsize Manor &#145;with vast expense&#146; according to Evelyn, in extensive grounds in St John's Wood  (Evelyn, 4.92). When her third husband died in October 1664, leaving everything to her (he had no children), she was very rich indeed. Apart from property she inherited his lucrative pensions, a monopoly on the manufacture of gunpowder for the crown, and the postmastership, which she continued to operate herself. In her last few years she lived at Belsize with Philip, who was with her when she &#145;became dropsicall, languished, and at last (without any paine) died&#146; on 9 April 1667  (<span class="italic">Letters of &hellip; Chesterfield</span>, 33). The final instruction in her will was to Philip, whom she directed to erect a monument to O'Neill in the parish church of St Nicholas at Boughton Malherbe, showing who he was &#145;and my Relation to him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/323, fol. 53). This he did with some style, though he took the opportunity to add his father to the memorial, which consisted of three white marble lions surmounted by a black marble pyramid, the three faces of the pyramid (now paving the vestry) referring respectively to O'Neill, Lady Stanhope, and Henry, Lord Stanhope.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15670"></a><span class="headword">Charles Henry Kirkhoven</span>, Baron Wotton and earl of Bellamont  (1643&#150;1682/3)<span class="occ"></span>, benefited in both England and the Netherlands from his parents' service to Princess Mary and the house of Orange. He was chief magistrate of Breda from 1659 to 1674, was granted a troop of horse by the states general &#145;through the intermission of the King&#146; and was given &#145;the conduct which his Father had of [Mary's] affairs&#146; and a post in her son's household, which apparently caused discontent among the Dutch (Lower, 66; Everett Green, vol. 6). He took his seat in the House of Lords in March 1663. On his mother's death he inherited the residue of her estate, as well as her property in Belsize Manor, which was visited by both Pepys and Evelyn. The former, in 1668, was more impressed by the gardens (&#145;the most noble that ever I saw&#146;) and the latter by the house: by 1676 the gardens were apparently less well kept  (Pepys, 9.281). Evelyn had earlier visited Lord Wotton himself in 1670 when Wotton was engaged in a venture to drain fenland at Soham Mere; Evelyn found the drainage engines striking, but the hopes of the participants unrealistic. Lady Stanhope's attempt in her will to arrange a marriage between her son and Honora O'Hara, O'Neill's niece, came to nothing, and on 25 August 1679 Lord Wotton married Frances (<i>b</i>. 1642), widow of Sir John Harpur of Swarkeston (buried February 1679), and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29603/', "William Willoughby, sixth Baron Willoughby")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29597/', "Willoughby, Francis")</script>], and Anne, daughter of Sir Philip Cary of Aldenham. He was created earl of Bellamont by patent dated 9 December 1680, but he died only a few years later &#145;of an Apoplexey&#146; and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral on 11 January 1683  (BL, Add. MS 19253). There were no children of the marriage, and Charles Henry, now earl of Bellamont, left his estate to Charles Stanhope (youngest son of his half-brother Philip, earl of Chesterfield), who carried on the family tradition by changing his surname to Wotton.<br>
