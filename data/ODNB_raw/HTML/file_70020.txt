<span class="headword">Wood,  Anne</span>  (1907&#150;1998), <span class="occ">singer and opera administrator</span>, was born on 2 August 1907 at The Grange, Crawley, Sussex, a daughter of Percival Wood, JP for Sussex, and his wife, Eleanor. She was educated at St Mary's School, Calne, and studied singing with Elena Gerhardt, George Parker, and Eve de Reussy before joining the BBC Singers in 1934 at the same time as Peter Pears, who became her lifelong friend. The two lived for a while close to each other in London, and before the war often exchanged experiences and views, while sharing many musical encounters. During the war, as a fluent German speaker, she was employed by the Ministry of Economic Warfare to work on &#145;black&#146; propaganda. By night she drove an ambulance. She was also employed by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, later ENSA.<br>
<br>After the war Wood's singing career as a leading mezzo-soprano came to fruition. A resourceful interpreter of modern music, she sang in many premi&egrave;res, including that of Benjamin Britten's <span class="italic">Spring Symphony</span> at Amsterdam in 1950. She was also a noted recitalist and was fluent in the interpretation of oratorio.<br>
<br>Wood was one of the leading lights in the formation, in 1948, of the English Opera Group, working as an administrator alongside Britten, John Piper, and Eric Crozier, the last-named teaching her the ins and outs of operatic management, which stood her in good stead when she struck out on her own. On the basis of that experience, and to help young singers to tackle new scores, Wood formed the Opera Studio with the well-known soprano Joan Cross. Until then no such school existed in Britain. That was in 1949; by 1952 it had developed into the London Opera School, and in 1959 it became the National School of Opera, which gave stage experience and advice to many young artists, latterly on the stage at Morley College, London.<br>
<br>When it developed into a larger organization, the London Opera Centre, in 1964, under the aegis of Covent Garden, Wood and Cross, no longer in total control, decided to resign from what had been their own creation. Wood opted to change course and formed Phoenix Opera in 1965. It employed, in its small but productive way, many leading singers, producers, and designers, and&#151;as a touring group&#151;gave many deeply satisfying performances, a few of them, under Yehudi Menuhin's aegis, at the Bath Festival. In its ten-year existence it performed twelve operas, always well prepared and sung, in 66 different venues. In 1975 the Arts Council withdrew its grant, ironically just after the company had made a successful tour of Austria and Yugoslavia sponsored by the British Council, and gradually the company had to reduce its activities to vanishing point, much to Wood's chagrin.<br>
<br>In the 1980s Wood was a moving force in setting up a singing award in memory of Pears, but that enterprise also failed after a few years, because of a lack of funds. She continued, almost to the end of her life, encouraging young singers with her long-standing partner, Johanna Peters (<i>d</i>, 2000). Together, out of the limelight, they did a power of good for the development of singing talent.<br>
<br>Wood was a formidable character, with strong ideas on how opera should be organized and performed. She propounded them fearlessly, often in the teeth of opposition from the opera establishment. That did not endear her to the powers that be, and probably prevented her from achieving the eminence she undoubtedly deserved. She died in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Westminster, on 12 June 1998.<br>
