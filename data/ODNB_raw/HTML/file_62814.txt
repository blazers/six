<span class="headword">Heaton,  Ellen</span>  (1816&#150;1894), <span class="occ">art collector and philanthropist</span>, was born on 18 November 1816 at 7 Briggate, Leeds, the elder of the two children of John Heaton (1769&#150;1852), bookseller and printer, and his wife, Ann Deakin (1774&#150;1841), who came from a family of West Riding farmers. Ellen Heaton and her younger brother, the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94166/', "John Deakin Heaton")</script>, received their earliest schooling from a Baptist minister, Mr Langdon, in Infirmary Street, Leeds. Both, however, became members of the Church of England as children. When she was ten years old, Ellen Heaton was sent to a school run by the Misses Plint in Wellington Street, Leeds; she remained there until 1833 when she became a boarder at Roe Head School, Mirfield.<br>
<br>Although Ellen Heaton was a brighter pupil than her brother, she was not encouraged to continue her studies because of the prevailing bias against advanced female education. She stimulated her intellect by joining the Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society, which was presided over by her brother and where she later delivered a paper entitled &#145;The care of health&#146; (1875); she is also said to have been the proprietor of the Leeds Subscription Library. She also regularly attended meetings of the British Association throughout the British Isles and was a fellow of the Royal Botanical Gardens. After coming into an inheritance on the death of her father, Heaton was determined to lead an independent life. She indulged her love of travel with frequent visits to the continent, and in 1867 even ventured as far afield as Poland and Russia. She often travelled with Fanny Haworth, with whom she had formed a domestic relationship while abroad in 1853. Her spending and disregard of convention often exasperated her more conservative brother: Dr Heaton objected to her unchaperoned sojourn at the seaside with the married artist Thomas Richmond and, as her trustee, disapproved of her making a loan of &pound;1200 to the artist, from whom in 1849 she had also commissioned her portrait. Her serene appearance belied her forceful and energetic personality.<br>
<br>Ellen Heaton cultivated literary and artistic relationships with some of the leading talents of her time, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, and John Ruskin. The Brownings were somewhat overwhelmed by her aggressive overtures of friendship and her insistence in 1859 that they sit for portraits by the artist Field Talfourd at her expense. That spring Elizabeth Barrett Browning confided to her sister Arabel:<blockquote>she comes here every day though not for long I must admit, just when people come. I find it trying sometimes. Only of course you won't repeat this&#151;she has made herself famous in Rome by &#145;pushing&#146; here &amp; there &amp; everywhere &amp; people laugh&#151;they laugh!&#151;she gave twenty pounds for my picture&#151;partly for me, &amp; partly for the artist&#151;&amp; I am afraid we are both of us &#145;<i>des ingrats</i>&#146;. (<span class="italic">Sublime and Instructive</span>, 261)</blockquote>Heaton donated both portraits to the National Portrait Gallery in 1870.<br>
<br>Unlike the Brownings, Ruskin was not daunted by Heaton's unbridled enthusiasm for his friendship and relished the opportunity to be her mentor. She first approached him in 1855 after reading the early volumes of <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span> to seek advice about some sketches by J. M. W. Turner which she was interested in purchasing, having seen his work at the Royal Academy. Happy to oblige, Ruskin approved her selection of Turners and proceeded to guide her art collecting activities in the direction of the young Pre-Raphaelite artists. He suggested that she patronize Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Arthur Hughes, J. W. Inchbold, and Edward Burne-Jones. Heaton followed Ruskin's advice in each instance with the exception of Burne-Jones, whose art did not appeal to her. She far preferred that of Rossetti, from whom she purchased seven watercolours and one oil painting. That number would have been greater by one had Ruskin not intervened in her purchase of <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> (1855, Tate collection). The pandit commandeered the watercolour for himself on the grounds that it represented the couple kissing, telling her that &#145;Prudish people might perhaps think it not quite a young lady's drawing&#146;  (Surtees, 37). In awe of Ruskin's reputation, and in the absence of more determined role models among women collectors, Heaton did not object to his interference.<br>
<br>Heaton remained loyal to Ruskin even after she stopped collecting art in the 1860s. Under his influence she turned her attention to philanthropy, working at Winnington Hall School for Octavia Hill and initiating charitable projects of her own in Leeds. She offered to pay the admission for Leeds working men to attend lectures on the university extension courses and planned teas for them in her home. She also collaborated with another Ruskin prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Lady Trevelyan, in promoting the products of poor lace makers in Devon and Cornwall. Ellen Heaton remained active in social causes until the last year of her life. After contracting bronchitis, she suffered a fatal heart attack at her home, 6 Woodhouse Square, Leeds, on Christmas day 1894. She was buried in St George's Church, Leeds. She left her estate to her nephew Beresford Rimington Heaton, who bequeathed her art collection to the Tate Gallery in 1940.<br>
