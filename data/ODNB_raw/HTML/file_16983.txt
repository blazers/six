<span class="headword">Longesp&eacute;e <span class="st"> [Lungesp&eacute;e]</span>,  William (I)</span>, third earl of Salisbury  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1167, <em>d.</em> 1226), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the natural son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script> and Ida de Tosny, probably the daughter of Roger (III) de Tosny, a powerful Anglo-Norman lord, and his wife, also Ida. Nothing further is known of the younger Ida's relationship with King Henry, but around Christmas 1181 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2379/', "Roger (II) Bigod, second earl of Norfolk")</script>. William's parentage on both sides seems to have been widely known, indeed he proclaimed it himself. His adoption of the coat of arms of his paternal grandfather, Geoffrey Plantagenet, namely azure, six leoncels rampant or, emphasized his descent from the counts of Anjou. And two of his charters in the cartulary of Bradenstoke Priory, Wiltshire, refer explicitly to &#145;Countess Ida, my mother&#146;  (London, nos. 481, 646). Moreover the list of prisoners taken by the French at Bouvines in 1214 included&#151;as well as Earl William himself&#151;&#145;Ralph Bigod, brother [half-brother] of the earl of Salisbury&#146;  (Molinier, 392); the younger son of Earl Roger Bigod, Ralph evidently had, and was known to have had, the same mother as Earl William, under whose command he was fighting. Nothing is known for certain of the date or circumstances of William's birth. His contemporary epithet Longesp&eacute;e, or Lungesp&eacute;e, may have been a conscious invocation of his namesake William Longsword, the second duke of Normandy (<i>r</i>. 928&#150;42), during whose time his mother's family was later believed to have begun its rise to prominence, or of the second King William, called Longesp&eacute;e as well as Rufus. <h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Little is known of Longesp&eacute;e's upbringing or early career, although in a letter of 1220 to Hubert de Burgh he reminded the justiciar that they had been brought up together. He received Appleby, Lincolnshire, from Henry II in 1188, which suggests that by then he had attained his majority. In 1196 his half-brother Richard I gave him in marriage <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47205/', "Ela (or Isabel), countess of Salisbury (b. in or after 1190, d. 1261)")</script>, the infant daughter and heir of William Fitzpatrick, earl of Salisbury. William and Ela had four sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16984/', "William (II) Longesp&#233;e")</script>, Richard, a canon of Salisbury, Stephen (<i>d</i>. 1260), a soldier and administrator made seneschal of Gascony in 1253 and lord justice of Ireland in 1259, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95180/', "Nicholas Longesp&#233;e (d. 1297)")</script>, bishop of Salisbury from 1291 to 1297. Of four daughters, Isabel married William de Vescy, Petronilla died unmarried, Ela married first Thomas, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1242), then Philip Basset, and Ida married first Walter Fitzrobert and second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61198/', "William de Beauchamp")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54497/', "Beauchamp, de, family")</script>].<br>
<br>Salisbury was in close attendance on Richard in Normandy from 1196 to 1198, when he attested charters at Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard and doubtless gained military experience in the campaigns against Philip Augustus. He was with the king shortly before Richard routed Philip outside Gisors on 28 September 1198, although his presence in the engagement is not recorded. He took part in John's coronation on 27 May 1199, and thereafter was frequently with the king, with whom he seems to have enjoyed most cordial relations. The rolls reveal the two gaming together, and Salisbury received a steady stream of royal favours, from gifts of wine to an annual pension, against which he was frequently lent money by the king. His earldom, however, conferred more status than wealth, for although the barony commanded fifty-six fees and he was custodian of Salisbury Castle, an important royal fortress on which the Angevins expended large sums, he held no castle of his own. Although the king resisted his claim as earl to hold the shrievalty of Wiltshire by hereditary right, he was appointed to this office three times: 1199&#150;1202, 1203&#150;1207, and 1213&#150;1226. In his capacity as sheriff, it was Salisbury's men who besieged the outlaw knight Fulk Fitzwarine in Stanley Abbey in 1202, but Salisbury himself was among those who procured John's pardon for Fitzwarine and his men the following year. Salisbury held a variety of other offices, being custodian of the castle and honour of Eye in February 1205, keeper of Dover Castle, most notably in 1212&#150;13, when French invasion threatened, and sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire from May 1212 to 1216. In 1208, when John moved to anticipate the interdict, Salisbury took custody of the lands of clergy in the diocese of Ely who refused to celebrate mass, and in August 1212 became supervisor of the keeper of the archbishopric of Canterbury. The same year, possibly in order to secure Salisbury's support in a time of increasing political disaffection, John supported his claim to the barony of Trowbridge, which he received in 1213 when the king disseized Henry de Bohun.<h2>
<a name="Diplomacyandsoldiering"></a>Diplomacy and soldiering</h2>Salisbury's diplomatic abilities are reflected in a series of important missions entrusted to him. Early in 1202 he negotiated a treaty between John and Sancho VII, king of Navarre. In 1204, together with the earl marshal, he escorted Llywelyn to the king at Worcester, was among those sent to treat with the king of Scots in November 1205, and accompanied William the Lion to meet John at York in November 1206. In March 1209 he headed an embassy to the princes of Germany on behalf of John's nephew Otto, who was subsequently crowned emperor, and in May 1212 he went on a mission to Ferrand, count of Flanders.<br>
<br>Salisbury's most prominent role, however, was as a military commander of considerable ability on both land and sea. In August 1202, together with William (I) Marshal and the earl of Surrey, he shadowed Philip Augustus's army as it withdrew in close order from the siege of Arques on learning of John's victory at Mirebeau. The lightly armed earls, however, only narrowly escaped capture by a counter-attack led by William des Barres. In 1203, he received back the important castle of Pontorson on the Breton border, which he had earlier exchanged for lands in England, and this, together with his being keeper of the castle of Avranches, suggests a marcher command against Breton attack. With the fall of Normandy he was given command of Gascony in May 1204, and in September made constable of Dover and warden of the Cinque Ports, which offices he retained until May 1206. In June 1205 he sailed to reinforce the garrison of La Rochelle, with the only part of the great force collected by John to see active service. In 1208 he was appointed keeper of the March of Wales, and he accompanied John on the Irish expedition of 1210. In May 1213, together with the counts of Holland and Boulogne, Salisbury led a powerful expeditionary force to aid Count Ferrand against Philip Augustus, the earl himself having been given a magnificent ship by King John. On 30 May the allied force attacked a large French fleet moored off Damme, a little north-east of Bruges, burning many ships but sending a great number back to England laden with arms and provisions. Although Salisbury and the forces which disembarked to raid inland were driven off on 1 June by the arrival of Philip's larger army, the naval victory was significant, and forced the French king to abandon his planned invasion of England. According to the <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> Salisbury, with William Marshal and the count of Boulogne, had been instrumental in advising this pre-emptive strike. Earlier that May he was one of the earls who swore that John would observe the papal terms concerning satisfaction to the bishops, and witnessed his declaration of homage to the papal see.<br>
<br>Later in 1213 Salisbury returned to Flanders with troops and a credit of over 20,000 marks. In 1214, as marshal of the king of England, he led the allied forces that recovered almost all of Flanders for Ferrand. At the fateful battle of Bouvines on 27 July 1214 he commanded the right wing of the allied army with Renaud de Dammartin, count of Boulogne. He fought bravely, but was clubbed from his horse by Philippe, the militant bishop of Beauvais, and taken captive. The <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> explicitly absolves him from blame for the failure at Bouvines, stating indeed that the battle was fought against his advice, and that the emperor Otto would have been taken or slain without Salisbury's aid. His release was still being negotiated in February 1215, but he was eventually exchanged for Robert, son of the count of Dreux. Back in England by May he was among those appointed to examine the state of royal castles, but his attempt to prevent London falling to the barons was unsuccessful. Dispatched with a force of Flemish mercenaries against insurgents in Devon, Salisbury succeeded in forcing the rebels to abandon Exeter.<h2>
<a name="MagnaCartaanditsaftermath"></a>Magna Carta and its aftermath</h2>It is uncertain whether Salisbury was present at Runnymede for the initial negotiations on 15 June, but he was named among those on whose advice <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> had been granted, which suggests he was with John by 19 June. Salisbury received extensive grants from the royal demesne in August in compensation for the honour of Trowbridge, restored to Henry de Bohun by the baronial committee of twenty-five as one of the king's unjust disseisins.<br>
<br>In October 1215 John ordered Salisbury to relieve Oxford and Northampton with a small field force drawn from the garrisons of ten royal castles, but it seems that Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; led the expedition. Following the fall of Rochester Castle in December Salisbury was one of the commanders left to contain the rebels in London while John led his forces north. With Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; and Savaric de Maul&eacute;on he conducted a punitive <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> through the predominantly rebel counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire, and Huntingdonshire. During the ravaging of the Isle of Ely in the early weeks of 1216, however, it was Salisbury who protected the womenfolk from the worst excesses of Walter Buc's Braban&ccedil;on mercenaries. He rejoined the king and aided him in the siege of Colchester, pledging on John's behalf to observe the surrender terms agreed with the French and baronial garrison, terms which the king subsequently violated.<br>
<br>After Louis's landing on 21 May 1216 Salisbury adhered to John until rapid French gains in the southern counties led the earl to submit to Louis at Winchester in late June. Little credence, however, need be given to the rumour recorded by William the Breton that Salisbury's defection was caused by John's seduction of Countess Ela while Salisbury had been a prisoner in France. Rather, he was prompted by the widely held belief that John's cause was now lost; nevertheless the king was still able to order his lands to be seized by 30 August. Following the death of John (19 October), Salisbury remained in Louis's camp and, according to Wendover, he attempted to persuade Hubert de Burgh to surrender Dover to the French. On 5 March 1217, however, during Louis's absence in France, Salisbury re-entered the king's faith and was absolved from excommunication. He brought with him William Marshal the younger, who was a close friend and ally, and around one hundred lesser men from Wiltshire and the south-west. A considerable blow to Louis, his return had been influenced by the worsening military position of the French, the fact that Henry de Bohun, his rival for the castle and honour of Trowbridge, was one of Louis's leading English supporters, and the regent's promise to him of Sherborne Castle and the counties of Somerset and Devon, simply in return for his &#145;homage and service&#146;.<br>
<br>Having witnessed the surrender of Knepp Castle near Shoreham, Salisbury and the younger Marshal laid siege to Winchester, taking the fortified episcopal palace of Wolvesey. On the arrival of the regent they were sent to Southampton, which they took, installing a constable before returning to share in the rich booty which had accrued from the surrender of Winchester (before 14 March). At the battle of Lincoln (20 May 1217) Salisbury commanded the third squadron of the royalist forces, and with the younger William Marshal led the charge through the west gate of the city against the French and English besieging the castle from the south and east. According to the <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> the Marshal saved Salisbury from the lance of Robert of Ropsley by felling this assailant, and together they proceeded to engage the count of Perche in front of the cathedral. After the royalist victory Salisbury was rewarded with custody of the city and county of Lincoln &#145;by common council&#146; of the king's supporters, although Ranulf (III) of Chester received the earldom. Later, in 1218, he and the regent partitioned the English manors of the count of Perche who had been killed in the battle; Salisbury gained those of Aldbourne and Wanborough in Wiltshire and adopted the latter as his chief seat in the shire. Salisbury took part with Hubert de Burgh in the naval victory off Sandwich on 24 August, in which the English intercepted a French fleet bringing vital reinforcements to Louis. He was closely involved in the resulting peace negotiations which culminated in the treaty of Lambeth, 12 September, and Louis's departure from the kingdom.<h2>
<a name="Amanofpower"></a>A man of power</h2>From 1217 until his death in 1226 Salisbury enjoyed a position of considerable power, his career epitomizing both the centrifugal and the centripetal forces which so characterized the minority of Henry III. Within his areas of influence he sought to exercise effective local autonomy without the interferences of central government. Between March 1217 and 1219 he tried to make effective the grants of the lordship of Somerset and Dorset and, later, of Alnwick, extorted from the regency, but failed against the power of John's sheriffs. He made repeated efforts to secure Lincoln Castle from the redoubtable Nicola de la Haie, the hereditary castellan, claiming both custody of the castle and wardship of the rich Haie barony in Lincolnshire, since his eldest son, still a minor, was betrothed to Idonea, daughter and heir of Richard de Camville (<i>d</i>. 1217). In May 1220, on the death of Robert of Berkeley, Salisbury seized Berkeley Castle and Robert's lands and chattels in a pre-emptive bid for wardship of his heir, &#145;against justice, the custom of the kingdom and the law of the land&#146;, as the earl of Pembroke complained to the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh  (Shirley, no. clv, p. 179).<br>
<br>Salisbury nevertheless professed himself strongly committed to government by the king's council, stating forcefully in 1220 that the only legitimate orders were those sanctioned by &#145;the magnates of England who are held to be and are of the chief council of the king, with other chief men&#146;  (Carpenter, 204). He supported the king and the justiciar Hubert de Burgh at crucial moments in the restoration of royal authority. In 1221 he opposed both the count of Aumale and Peter de Mauley. At Christmas 1221, and again at Northampton in December 1223, when the country came to the verge of civil war, he stood with the justiciar against the powerful dissident faction of the earl of Chester, Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute;, Engelard de Cigogn&eacute;, Brian de Lisle, and other castellans reluctant to yield up their shrievalties and castles. In this Salisbury represented, in his own words, &#145;we native-born men of England&#146; against those &#145;aliens&#146; who were felt to be fomenting war within the kingdom  (Shirley, no. cxcvi, p. 221). In June 1222, on Henry's second act of resumption of royal demesnes, he yielded a number of royal manors, and in February 1223 he surrendered Salisbury Castle, only to receive it back directly, with the custody of the castles of Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth, and the shrievalties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsdeathandreputation"></a>Last years, death and reputation</h2>Salisbury retained his role as a leading military commander until his death. In mid-1223 Salisbury was joint leader with William Marshal of a force of 140 knights, sent by Hubert de Burgh against Llywelyn, which established control over Kidwelly and Ceredigion. In 1225 he accompanied Richard of Cornwall, then only sixteen, as the effective leader of the successful expedition to Gascony, which reasserted English control in the province and secured it from the invasion of Louis VIII. Before La R&eacute;ole fell on 13 November, however, Salisbury had fallen sick and embarked on a difficult three-months voyage home. Driven ashore on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;, held for Louis by Savaric de Maul&eacute;on, he took shelter in the abbey of Notre Dame de R&eacute;. He was warned to escape, according to Matthew Paris, by two of Savaric's men, to whom he gave &pound;20, and set sail again. He landed in Cornwall at Christmas, and in January was received with great rejoicing in Salisbury Cathedral. Paris relates an implausible tale of an attempted poisoning of the earl by Hubert de Burgh. The story is undoubtedly false, for the two men were close and the earl's death at Salisbury Castle on 7 March 1226 was almost certainly the result of the illness contracted in Gascony. He was buried in the lady chapel of Salisbury Cathedral, whose foundation stones he and his countess had laid on 28 April 1220, with the assistance of the legate Pandulf. Later moved to the easternmost bay of the south arcade of the nave, his tomb, carved <i>c</i>.1240 by craftsmen of the Wells school, was one of the finest military effigies of its period. On an arcaded oak tomb chest enriched with mosaic inlay on gesso, the originally richly coloured effigy of local Doulting stone depicted Salisbury in gilded mail armour with armorial surcoat and shield.<br>
<br>Despite his prominence Salisbury's character remains enigmatic. His support for John during his excommunication led Wendover to number him among the king's evil counsellors, while the annals of Dunstable believed it was Salisbury who, on John's orders, arrested Geoffrey of Norwich who later died in captivity as a result of his harsh treatment. The opprobrium of monastic chroniclers, however, was short-lived. Wendover approvingly noted his especial veneration of the Virgin, before whose altar he had kept a light burning since the day of his knighthood, and who it was claimed had appeared to Salisbury during his shipwreck in 1225. The same chronicler accords him a pious end, when, stripped and with a halter round his neck, he knelt before Richard Poor, bishop of Salisbury, declaring himself a traitor to God and refusing to rise until he had confessed and received the sacrament. His salvation was betokened by the fact that the candles in his funeral procession from the castle to the cathedral remained alight despite a raging storm. &#145;When William, the flower of earls resigned his princely breath&#146;, ran the epitaph added by Matthew Paris, &#145;his long sword was content to find a shorter sheath&#146;  (Paris, 3.105).<br>
<br>Certainly Salisbury and his wife seem to have been more than conventionally devout. His will largely comprises benefactions to religious houses. He endowed the Augustinian house of Bradenstoke, Wiltshire, founded by Ela's great-grandfather, Walter of Salisbury, and was commemorated at the hospital of St Nicholas, Salisbury. In 1222 he gave the manor of Hatherop, Gloucestershire, for a Carthusian foundation, adding further endowments in his will, although at the monks' request his widow afterwards moved them to her manor of Henton (or Hinton), Somerset, where the monastery of Locus Dei was dedicated in 1232. The same year Ela began an Augustinian nunnery at Lacock, where she herself took the veil in 1238 and became abbess in 1239.<br>
<br>Longesp&eacute;e was a political figure of the first rank, symbolizing not only the important role played by royal bastards, but the multifaceted competence in administration, diplomacy, and war which characterized leading figures in the Angevin regime. He has been labelled among the &#145;conspicuous trimmers&#146;  (Carpenter, xviii) during the period of crisis in 1216&#150;17, but the <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span>, written in the 1220s, and possibly after Salisbury's death, passes over his temporary defection to Louis in silence. Rather he is portrayed with no little justification as a loyal, courageous, and skilful commander, &#145;whose mother was largesse and whose banner was prowess&#146;  (Meyer, ll. 12125&#150;8), the former compliment perhaps being a tactful inversion of his illegitimacy.<br>
