<span class="headword">Tottenham,  Charles</span>  (1685&#150;1758), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only child of Edward Tottenham (<i>d</i>. 1712), landowner, of Tottenhamgreen, Ballyloskeran, near Taghmon, co. Wexford, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Hayman (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1713) of Youghal, co. Cork. By 1713 he had married Ellinor (<i>d</i>. 1745), the daughter of John Cliffe, of Mulrankin, co. Wexford, a prominent tory member of the Irish House of Commons. Tottenham had to wait until the general election of 1727 before he himself acquired a seat in the Irish parliament, for the borough of New Ross, possibly on the interest of Arthur Annesley, fifth earl of Anglesey.<br>
<br>Except for one famous incident, Tottenham made little mark in public life. It seems likely that he shared the high-church proclivities of his family and connections, who included the Wexford families of Loftus and Colclough. By 1727 their brand of toryism had been transmuted into die-hard support for the &#145;patriot&#146; opposition. Tottenham's moment of glory probably came in November 1731, when it would appear that he gave the crucial vote to defeat a proposal from government to secure long-term funding of the Irish national debt. According to legend (which does not identify correctly the particular division concerned), he had only arrived at the last minute to vote, after an overnight ride from co. Wexford, having heard that the question was to come on sooner than expected. He had been obliged to force his way past the serjeant-at-arms, since he was &#145;undressed, in dirty boots, and splashed up to his shoulders&#146;, and it was contrary to the rules of the House of Commons for a member to appear improperly attired. But, so the story went, the speaker decided that he had no power to exclude Tottenham, who strode into the chamber in his riding boots &#145;to vote for the country&#146;. Little was heard of this curious episode at the time, and nothing subsequently until 1749, when an engraving was made of &#145;Tottenham in his boots&#146;, carrying a riding crop, on the steps of the Parliament House. This was based on a portrait by Justin Pope Stevens, evidently painted in 1749 but dated as 1731. The probable occasion for the engraving was a parliamentary fracas in the 1749 session over the appropriation of the surplus in parliamentary funds. Tottenham was briefly to regret his renown when he voted with the government in favour of the altered money bill four years later, in 1753, and was subjected to a stinging rebuke in the <span class="italic">Dublin Spy</span>, which accused him of exchanging his hallowed boots for &#145;Court stilts and dirty spatter-dashes&#146; and declared that his name would &#145;stink on the dunghill of bad fame to all ages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Spy</span>, 24 Dec 1753, 7). In fact, this indiscretion was soon forgotten, and in the later eighteenth century his reputation not only recovered but steadily grew. Indeed, the toast &#145;Tottenham in his boots&#146; became a staple of Irish patriotic conviviality. Though his was not the only vote delivered in boots in the Irish parliament, it was by far the most often remembered. &#145;This anecdote could not die while the Irish parliament lived&#146;  (Barrington, 1.105&#150;6), wrote Sir Jonah Barrington, whose account of the episode related it to a division on the appropriation of a revenue surplus. Later still, opponents of the Anglo-Irish Union of 1801 depicted &#145;Tottenham and his boots&#146; as having successfully resisted the efforts of an English minister &#145;to deprive Ireland of a resident legislature&#146;  (obituary notice of Lord Arran, <i>c</i>.1809, Arran MSS, T 3200/2/48).<br>
<br>Tottenham and his first wife had six sons and two daughters. His second marriage, in 1746, to Mary (<i>c</i>.1694&#150;1777), the twice-widowed daughter of John Grogan of Johnstown, co. Wexford, who had been previously married to two other Wexford gentlemen, Major Andrew Knox and William Hore of Harperstown, produced no children. Tottenham died on 20 September 1758 and his eldest son, John, later first baronet, succeeded him and served as MP for New Ross and Fethard in the Irish parliament. His son Charles Tottenham (afterwards Loftus) enjoyed a long and successful political career, but as a ministerialist and pro-unionist rather than a patriot, and received no less than five separate peerage creations, as Baron and Viscount Loftus, then earl (1794) and marquess (1800) of Ely in the Irish peerage, and Baron Loftus (1801) in that of the United Kingdom.<br>
