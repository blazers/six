<span class="headword">Kindersley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wicksteed]</span>,  Jemima</span>  (1741&#150;1809), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, was born into the modest Wicksteed family on 2 October 1741 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where on 19 April 1762 she married Lieutenant Nathaniel Kindersley (1732&#150;1769) of the Royal Artillery. They met at a local ball, where he was doubtless struck by her beauty, for she became known as Pulcherrima. Their only son, Nathaniel (1763&#150;1831), was born on 2 February 1763.<br>
<br>In 1764 Kindersley transferred as captain to the East India Company's Bengal artillery, and sailed for Calcutta with his wife and son. Despite her humble background and initial lack of education, Jemima Kindersley responded to the opportunities of her elevation in society. She acquired a fluent prose style, a knowledge of French, and an acquaintance with the ideas of leading philosophers such as Montesquieu, and historians of South America and Asia, which enabled her to write a confident account of her journey to India and life there, mainly in Calcutta and Allahabad, from 1764 to 1768, <span class="italic">Letters from the Island of Teneriffe, Brazil, the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies</span>. Her work gives an interesting account of the early period of British consolidation in north India. It is also important as one of the first travel books by a woman, a field in which there were soon to be many female contributors.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Letters</span>, which contain no personal information and omit her shipwreck in Bengal, record her wide-ranging observations of local life, religion, and culture, and consider more generally the prevailing characteristics of Indian society. She approached India within the framework of Enlightenment thought and concerns elaborated particularly by Montesquieu, believing that climate shaped character, and that presumed &#145;oriental despotism&#146; undermined politics, society, and military achievement, and controlled the lives of Indian women. She was particularly interested in the latter, and sought to investigate suttee. As a woman she was able to visit a zenana in Allahabad, and gives one of the earliest Western accounts of the appearance and life of Muslim women. Her careful description avoids overdramatization, but stresses the restrictions imposed on them.<br>
<br>Jemima Kindersley returned to England with her son in 1769 because of ill health, and her husband died in Calcutta the same year. The <span class="italic">Letters</span> were published in 1777, possibly to earn money, since she was left with only a small pension, from which she helped support her mother. Her work met with a warm response; several periodical journals published excerpts, while the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, though noting that much of her information was not new, praised the narration of &#145;a variety of amusing particulars with much ease and simplicity, and with every mark of fidelity&#146;  (57, 1777, 243). She thus helped set the pattern for women travel writers, who were welcomed for their style and ability to popularize subject-matter which was often dry or difficult of access.<br>
<br>Her interest in the status and treatment of Indian women led her to give wider consideration to the role of women. However, she found that her intended work had been pre-empted by the publication in French of a book by Antoine Thomas, which she translated in 1781 as <span class="italic">Essay on the Character, Manners and Understanding of Women, in Different Ages</span>. Appended to it were two of her own essays. One incorporated ideas suggested by her experience in India and argued that women were controlled by men in direct relation to the power they possessed over them: thus Indian men, who were highly susceptible to the sexual attractions of women, curtailed their rights and freedom, while Dutchmen, &#145;unacquainted with that jealousy which torments a Mussulman&#146;, granted their women considerable liberty  (essay 1, 225). Her second essay called for improved education for women.<br>
<br>She lived in Southampton and later Bath, mixing in cultivated circles. Her son joined the East India Company as a civilian; he shared his mother's literary tastes and interest in India, publishing <span class="italic">Specimens of Hindoo Literature</span> (1794). The care of his growing family while he was in India provided an interest in her later years, though she had a reputation for irritability, the result perhaps of loneliness and the ill health from which she never fully recovered. She died in Beaumont Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, probably in April 1809, and was buried on 25 April at St Marylebone.<br>
