<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span>, Baron Williams  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1559), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second surviving son of Sir John Williams (<i>d</i>. 1508) of Burghfield, Berkshire, and his wife, Isabel, daughter and coheir of Richard More of Burghfield and Preston Candover, Hampshire. His father, who was of Welsh descent, was a kinsman of Morgan Williams, who married Thomas Cromwell's sister and became a courtier and soldier at Henry VIII's court. It seems likely that John was sent to court at an early age, although the name is too common to identify him with certainty as the man who was Henry VIII's footman or groom in 1519&#150;20. By July 1524 he had married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1504&#150;1556), the widowed daughter and coheir of a neighbour, Thomas Bledlow of Bledlow; her first husband, Andrew Edmonds, had died on 23 June 1523. By 1526 Williams can be confidently identified as a rising minor official around the court, with a chancery office and responsibilities for confidential matters, among them the conveyance of large sums of money to the court from London. He was beginning to accumulate profitable minor county offices such as that of bailiff of the lordship of Hanley, Worcestershire, and also leases of lands and lordships. By 1535 he was receiver at Thame, where the abbot was Robert King, the brother-in-law of his sister Anne, and he maintained his association with that town until he was eventually able to buy the abbey from the duke of Somerset.<br>
<br>It is unclear where Williams received his financial training, but by the time he was appointed clerk of the king's jewels on 8 May 1530 he was sufficiently competent to move steadily up the ladder of royal financial offices, to which he added private receiverships. He became one of Thomas Cromwell's inner circle, and in January 1535 was joined with him in the office of master of the jewels. By then he was established enough to be appointed a JP in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. He evidently also had some military skills and served in the army against the rebels in the north in 1536. The duke of Suffolk assigned him the task of compiling a book for Lincolnshire &#145;of all &hellip; detections &hellip; by gentilmen, yeoman or commoner&#146;, as a result of which he wrote to Cromwell on 27 October 1536 that nowhere had he seen &#145;such a sight of asses, so unlike gentlemen&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 11, nos. 838, 888). By this time he had the resources to start buying land, acquiring Rycote from Giles Heron in a purchase that was confirmed in 1540 by a special clause in Heron's act of attainder. In 1538 he bought Wytham in Berkshire from Leonard Chamberlayne.<br>
<br>Although one of his sisters was prioress of Studley, Williams seems to have been a willing reformer, serving as a visitor to the monasteries and writing to Cromwell from Winchester on 21 September 1538 that &#145;we intend both at Hyde and St Mary's to sweep away all the rotten bones that be called relics &hellip; lest it should be thought we came more for the treasure than for avoiding of the abomination of idolatry&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/2, no. 401). He was knighted between 15 November 1538 and 28 June 1539, and in the autumn of 1539 was appointed sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. He was reappointed in 1544&#150;5 and from this time was routinely appointed to all the major local commissions. In 1542 and again in 1547 he sat in parliament for Oxfordshire. In 1544 he was licensed to retain 10 men, and in 1545 was appointed captain of 20 archers and 40 billmen for the army in France. By 1540 he was involved in the purchase and resale of monastic lands, making considerable profits from his speculations in the following decade. He was rapidly increasing his holdings and offices in Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Northamptonshire, buying both from the crown and privately, and he continued to expand his estates until his death. He was an unpopular landlord: in 1549 the rebellious commons threw down his parks and killed all the deer.<br>
<br>Williams survived Cromwell's fall to become sole master of the jewels, a potentially dangerous responsibility since it was not only a crucial financial reserve but also one easy to raid, particularly since the gold and jewels that Williams had helped to strip from the monasteries were assigned to the jewel house but imperfectly inventoried. Henry VIII failed for many years to order a survey, and although Williams surrendered his position in 1544 to Anthony Aucher, his accounts as master could not be finalized until 1552, and as late as 1556 it was alleged that he had received jewels with which he should be charged. As the office for the jewel house he used the London house of the dissolved priory of Elsing Spittle, Cripplegate, which he bought in 1540. There was a major crisis on 24 December 1541 when there was a big fire there and &#145;divers juelles and goodes of the Kinges and allso of his were embesylled and convayed away&#146;  (Wriothesley, 1.133). But Williams survived this disaster, and in March 1544 he was appointed treasurer of augmentations, a position he retained in the second court set up in 1547 until its dissolution in January 1554. As such he was a major paymaster of council warrants and had to appear regularly before the council to give advice on royal resources. He remained an adviser in the early years of Edward's reign. In October 1549 he was among those ordered to Windsor to arrest Somerset and protect the king. The earl of Warwick, however, distrusted him, and in October 1551 the imperial ambassador reported that he had been arrested. As news of the death in Padua of his two surviving sons in August can only just have reached him, this must have been a moment of personal crisis. On 8 April 1552 the council committed him to solitary confinement in the Fleet, but this was rescinded on the 25th on the grounds of his deteriorating health. Edward VI recorded that he had disobeyed an order not to pay pensions without the council's foreknowledge. On 22 May 1552 he was released after making a humble submission to the council for failing to do his duty in his office, and he sat in parliament for Oxfordshire in March 1553.<br>
<br>Williams's methods of keeping his books appear to have been distinctly less satisfactory than those of his predecessor. This may explain the discrepancies and failure to record payments that caused problems for men like Sir Maurice Denys, the treasurer of Calais, and bedevilled his own final accounting which was not completed for several years. Moreover he did not assist in the hearing of accounts, and the overall management of the second court of augmentations was more lax than that of the first. He himself apparently claimed a payment of &pound;15,000 to Peter Osborne, the keeper of the king's privy purse, in two successive accounts. The fraudulent discharge of certain obligations, about which he knew nothing, became a matter of textbook law. When his account was finalized, on 5 June 1556, he owed the crown &pound;25,000, but five days later in consideration of his services he was pardoned all his arrears both as master of the jewels and treasurer of augmentations. This magnanimity came after some anxious moments when, as Sir Edmund Peckham reported, Williams was &#145;fayent to brake up hys howse and to lyve at beconfeld because of the queen's lack of generosity&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 11/8/52).<br>
<br>Mary had good reason to reward Williams. Before 13 July 1553 he had proclaimed her queen in Oxfordshire and raised troops&#151;some said 6000&#151;in her support. On 22 July he was ordered to dismiss his men and to wait upon the queen but she continued to employ him in a military role. His loyalty led to his appointment for the third time as sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire, which in the year 1553&#150;4 gave him a key role in maintaining Mary's hold on the home counties. In February 1554, in the aftermath of the Wyatt rebellion, he was commanded to provide 100 horse and 100 foot for the queen's retinue. On 8 March 1554 he was ordered to convey Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer to Oxford. As a reward he was summoned to parliament in April as Baron Williams of Thame, and given the honourable position of chamberlain to King Philip. He was also made responsible for the safe keeping of Princess Elizabeth, and in that capacity escorted her from the Tower to Woodstock and entertained her <i>en route</i> at Rycote, establishing a good relationship with her in the process. He was a regular attender in the Lords and a trier of petitions, but was not otherwise prominent there. His wife died on 25 October 1556 and was buried on 4 November in the chapel at Rycote. In the following year, about 19 April, he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Thomas, first Baron Wentworth of Nettlestead.<br>
<br>Williams's religious attitude is unclear. He was present at the burning of Latimer and Ridley on 16 October 1555 and of Cranmer on 21 March 1556, but there were rumours that he was favourable to protestants and he was consequently dismissed. The latter report was unfounded, but the friends named in his will&#151;the earl of Bedford, William Cecil, Walter Mildmay, and Robert Dudley&#151;were undoubted protestants, and in 1559 he received Bishop John Jewel, recently returned from exile, in his house. In November 1558 he was one of those who attended Elizabeth from Hatfield to London and in January 1559 was appointed lord president of the council in the marches of Wales. He died at Ludlow Castle while exercising this office on 14 October 1559 and was buried with great pomp on 15 November 1559 in Thame church, where his splendid tomb, with effigies of Williams and his first wife, still stands in the middle of the chancel. His widow later married William Drury and then James Crofts. His heirs were the two daughters of his first marriage, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69748/', "Margery Norris")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20272/', "Norris, Henry, first Baron Norris")</script>]. In his will he assigned property for the endowment of a free school at Thame and provision for the restoration of the footway between Oxford and Botley.<br>
