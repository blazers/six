<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Charles</span>, Baron Hill of Luton  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">doctor, politician, and broadcaster</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 15 January 1904, the youngest in the family of two sons and a daughter of Charles Hill, maker of pianoforte parts, who died in 1906, and his wife, Florence Madeleine Cook, bookkeeper, the seventh of eight children of a seller of mineral water. His mother remarried in 1916, her husband being W. E. Hulme, linotype operator in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>.<br>
<br>Educated at St Olave's School, Tower Bridge, Hill was awarded a Drapers' Company scholarship and a sizarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1921, and went on to read in parallel both medicine and part one of the natural sciences tripos, in which he received first-class honours in 1925. He completed his medical education at the London Hospital, obtaining his MRCS, LRCP in 1927 and MB, BChir in 1929. He then took up a hospital post in Nottingham and became deputy medical officer of health in Oxford in 1930. He obtained his DPH in 1931. Determined and ambitious and more interested in administration than in medical practice, Hill was appointed an assistant secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA) in 1932. He stayed at the BMA headquarters in Tavistock Square for the next eighteen years (gaining his MD in 1936), climbing a ladder which took him to the top rung, when in 1944 he achieved the position of secretary, the senior full-time officer post, which he held until 1950.<br>
<br>Convinced of the importance of winning public support to buttress the BMA's cause, Hill had by 1944 become one of the best-known figures in the country in his own right, though not under his own name, after being invited in 1941 to take part in the BBC's <span class="italic">Kitchen Front</span> programmes. In a remarkable series of wartime broadcasts, mainly given live, which came to cover a wide range of health problems, Hill, giving helpful advice as the &#145;radio doctor&#146;, soon won a huge audience. His rich, warm, and homely&#151;if often booming&#151;voice, so different from most BBC voices even in wartime, contributed to his success as a broadcaster, but did not guarantee it. His secret was careful preparation, meticulous selection of points to emphasize, and intuitive choice of exactly the right words. One of his broadcasts, which deserves the adjective classic, was delivered after the war on Boxing day in 1949. It began &#145;This is stomach speaking. Yes I mean it, your stomach&#146;. This broadcast was addressed to children. Hill, who in 1931 had married Marion Spencer, daughter of Moses Wallace, a Halifax mill owner, whom he had met at Cambridge, knew a lot about children. He had two sons and three daughters, and for all his ebullience he always gave the reassuring air of being a real family doctor. As secretary of the BMA, he fought hard between 1945 and 1948 to ensure that the new National Health Service would incorporate family choice of doctor and that the profession would not become a state-salaried service for general practitioners. Hill revelled in the rough and tumble of contest with Aneurin Bevan, the minister of health, whose political skills he came greatly to admire, but he could also show patience and forbearance in dealing both with politicians and professional colleagues.<br>
<br>It was through struggles about health policy that Hill was drawn into party politics, which had never interested him at Cambridge, and eventually in 1957 into the cabinet, although his attitude to party was as unorthodox as that of the first Lord Beaverbrook, the intermediary who arranged for him to be summoned to an interview at the Conservative Party central office in 1944. Indeed, when Hill first stood (unsuccessfully) for parliament, for Cambridge University, at the general election of 1945, it was not as a Conservative but as an independent. When he won Luton at the next general election in 1950, it was as a Conservative and Liberal. Hill used his formidable oratorical talents at that election to deliver one of the outstanding controversial political broadcasts before the age of television.<br>
<br>Hill did not have to wait long for governmental office, and having served from 1951 to 1955 as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Food&#151;an unenviable post, for most back-benchers in his party wished to see his ministry abolished&#151;he was made postmaster-general by Sir Anthony Eden in April 1955, being sworn of the privy council at the same time. This post greatly appealed to him and, surviving Suez, he went on under Harold Macmillan to become chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster in January 1957. His responsibilities for supervising government information services straddled these last two posts. Finally, Macmillan made him minister of housing and local government in October 1961, combined with the ministry of Welsh affairs, before removing him in his sudden, and to Hill premature, government reshuffle in July 1962. In any event Hill would have retired at the next election.<br>
<br>A new career now began, first in business and then in broadcasting. Hill was so successful a chairman of the Independent Television Authority, a post to which he was appointed in 1963, refurbishing its image and presiding over the recasting of the television company structure, that a Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, moved him from Brompton Road to become chairman of the BBC in 1967. This was a highly controversial move much resented in the BBC, particularly by Sir Hugh Greene, the director-general, and Hill's first years there were difficult. But he outlasted Greene, and had his tenure extended in 1972 in order to preside over the BBC's golden jubilee. Hill was a strong, eloquent, and effective supporter of BBC autonomy.<br>
<br>Hill kept a diary during his years as chairman of the BBC and wrote two volumes of compact and readable memoirs, <span class="italic">Both Sides of the Hill</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">Behind the Screen</span> (1974). His only other published work, a joint one, was <span class="italic">What is Osteopathy?</span> (1937). His appearance was as memorable as his voice. Short, plump, and brimful of energy, he was a favourite of cartoonists, but he liked rather than objected to this. Hill was made a life peer in 1963 and awarded an LLD by Saskatchewan University in 1950. He died in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, on 22 August 1989. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 17 November 1989.<br>
