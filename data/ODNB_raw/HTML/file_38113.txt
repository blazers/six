<span class="headword">Watts,  Susanna</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1768, <em>d.</em> 1842), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born in Leicester, and baptized on 5 July 1768, the youngest of three daughters (the two elder of whom died young from tuberculosis) of John Watts, the last of an impoverished genteel family (related to Alaric A. Watts), and his wife, Joan <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (<i>d</i>. 1807), an &#145;uneducated country girl&#146; whom he had married for her beauty. Susanna's father died when she was a baby. To support her mother, she learned French and Italian in order to teach and translate. Her remarkable landscapes composed of feathers won a medal from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.<br>
<br>Susanna Watts's first book was <span class="italic">Chinese maxims, translated from <span class="roman">[Robert Dodsley's]</span> The oeconomy of human life, into heroic verse</span> (1784). Specimens of her verse translations of Tasso, <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span>, and Verri, <span class="italic">Roman Nights</span>, circulated to warm critical praise; but &#145;unforeseen circumstance&#146; prevented their publication. She wrote a scholarly life to preface the Tasso, and clearly identified with his confinement and melancholy. She wrote for public occasions and for magazines, &#145;fagging and scribling whole summers &amp; winters&#146;  (Watts, <span class="roman">scrapbook</span>, 2.166). Her <span class="italic">Original Poems, and Translations, Particularly Ambra, from Lorenzo de'Medici</span> (1802) includes some items by others. Her pioneer guidebook, <span class="italic">A Walk through Leicester</span> (1804), remained anonymous until her death. Maria Edgeworth mentions, in 1802, that Watts had sold a four-volume novel (untraced) to William Lane for 10 guineas and that Richard Lovell Edgeworth doubted her talent too much to recommend her to the publisher Joseph Johnson; Watts seems to have kept a copy of Maria Edgeworth's condescending letter.<br>
<br>About 1806 Susanna Watts's mother became insane; next year a relative of her friend Elizabeth Heyrick secured her &pound;20 from the Royal Literary Fund. Her mother died soon afterwards. She supported herself by teaching little girls, and, with Heyrick, won local fame for philanthropy: when slaves were emancipated in 1834, she was f&ecirc;ted. She published in many forms (often with wit and playfulness) against slavery and cruelty to animals, and founded (<i>c</i>.1828) and held office in a Society for the Relief of Indigent Old Age. Her anthology of poems for children, <span class="italic">The Selector</span> (1823), ranges eclectically from Alexander Pope to Lord Byron and Jane Taylor. A well-kept secret until recently has been Watts's <span class="italic">The Wonderful Travels of Prince Fan-Feredin, in the Country of Arcadia</span> (1799), well reviewed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. She translated this from the French of 1735 (reprinted 1788) of G. H. Bougeant. The book is a spirited and intricate blend of romance and mock romance. Watts's anti-slavery periodical, the <span class="italic">Humming Bird</span> (twelve numbers, 1824&#150;5), shows equal panache. The professed editors are the three sisters Truth, Common Sense, and Philanthropy; when the magazine passes comment on pro-slavery views, Philanthropy is represented as so angry that Common Sense has to censor her. With Elizabeth Heyrick, Watts initiated an abolitionist sugar boycott in Leicester in 1824&#151;canvassing grocers rather than consumers&#151;and by June 1825 almost one quarter of Leicester's population had given up sugar.<br>
<br>On Watts's death an anonymous memoir appeared in a volume of her <span class="italic">Hymns and Poems</span> (1842). A better picture of her lively intellectual life emerges from her scrapbook. This begins with her Tasso and diverges into immense variety&#151;from poems (manuscript and printed, by herself and many others), mementoes, statistics, portraits (many of women writers), and data on Hindu and Arabic languages, to diagrams of the hold of a slave ship. She died in Leicester on 11 February 1842 and was buried at St Mary de Castro Church on 15 February. She was unmarried.<br>
