<span class="headword">Pinto,  Isaac  de</span>  (1717?&#150;1787), <span class="occ">writer on economics</span>, was born probably in the Netherlands at Amsterdam (or perhaps in Bordeaux, France, in 1715) to a Portuguese-Jewish merchant family; his father was David de Pinto, a merchant, his mother L&eacute;a, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ximenes. He married Rachel, the daughter of Benjamin Henriques. The family had prospered and moved to Amsterdam, where Isaac became an important figure in international finance and an adviser on commercial and colonial policy to the stadholder William IV and to the English East India Company, as well as a director of the Dutch West India Company. In 1761 he lent &pound;6.6 million to the British Treasury. He also served as chairman of the board of the Amsterdam synagogue and secretary of the Dutch Academy of Sciences. Enjoying spectacular personal wealth, he owned a palace at Tulpenburg, and an Amsterdam town house, said to have been paved with pieces of gold, in which he entertained the stadholder. Following heavy losses on the collapse of Dutch West Indies Company stock, Pinto headed in 1762 for Paris, where his financial affairs recovered somewhat and his literary career began to flourish. He met and befriended David Hume in 1764, along with other notables of the republic of letters. He also maintained his sumptuous lifestyle despite his reduced circumstances; his dinner parties became the stuff of contemporary legend. Well disposed towards Britain, Pinto gave invaluable advice to the duke of Bedford, Britain's representative at the treaty of Paris in 1763; his advice was based on his inside knowledge of the French negotiating position, and he warned against potentially costly errors in the draft treaty. His counsel led to the terms of the definitive version being reworded to Britain's advantage. For this service the East India Company in 1767, following the advocacy of Hume and other highly placed friends and contacts (the stadholder's widow was a daughter of George II), rewarded Pinto with a lifetime pension of &pound;500 per annum. The following year he was received by the British monarch.<br>
<br>Pinto became well known for his writings on economics. These were translated into English by Sir Philip Francis (although published under the name of Francis's cousin the Revd S. W. Baggs) and were widely discussed&#151;although less widely accepted, given that their controversial content challenged current conceptions of wealth and, to some extent, morality. Adam Smith was notably hostile to his views on credit and the stock exchange without ever mentioning him by name. Werner Sombart and Henri S&eacute;e both later described Pinto as a major innovator in economic science for his role in explaining the role of credit and speculation. His writings furnish a detailed and informed account of the practice of stock-jobbing on the Dutch money market as well as Anglo-Dutch and international finance in general. He characterized speculation in the money market as a form of gambling, but defended the operation of credit and debt in the economy as a generally benign factor, and as one prone to foster social dynamism. This led Karl Marx later to describe him, somewhat disdainfully, as &#145;the Pindar of the Amsterdam stock exchange&#146;  (Marx, 251). His best-known economic work was the <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de la circulation et du cr&eacute;dit</span> (Amsterdam, 1771), which emphasized the economically beneficial aspects of the national debt, then a controversial subject. It was, Pinto argued&#151;against the opinion of David Hume and others&#151;Britain's superior public credit which accounted for one of the main sources of the country's growing prosperity in Europe and its comparative strategic power in the mid-century wars for empire. He famously argued that the unexpected British victories at Havana in 1762 and in the Seven Years' War generally were underwritten by huge public borrowings. In the same work he also opposed the doctrines of leading physiocrats, particularly Mirabeau and Quesnay, for their agrarian fundamentalism, which he termed &#145;the frenzy of the soil&#146;  (Hertzberg, 74), and their misunderstanding of the role of public credit in modern commercial economies. France's relative decline as a European power, he asserted, was not due to the growth of credit, rather the failure of its maintenance on the part of the state. Too much emphasis on the domestic rural economy could foster a society lacking in dynamism. It was no accident that Dutch investment capital flowed into England rather than France. As anti-Jewish prejudice was widespread across Europe, even in the writings of some Enlightenment figures, aspects of Pinto's economic writings may also have been implicitly intended to defend the role of Jews in Europe's capital markets.<br>
<br>As a cosmopolitan and well-connected figure, Pinto also kept up a lively interest in the world of letters of his day and wrote a number of works on moral and political questions. His <span class="italic">Essai sur le luxe</span> (Amsterdam, 1762) was an investigation and a moderate defence of the expansion of luxury consumption which in some respects prepared the ground for his later economic work. The <span class="italic">R&eacute;flections critiques sur le premier chap&icirc;tre du VIIe volume des &#339;uvres de M. de Voltaire</span> (Amsterdam, 1762), also published in Paris the same year as the <span class="italic">Apologie pour la nation juive</span>, was a response to the calumnies against the Jews contained in Voltaire's entry &#145;Juifs&#146; in his <span class="italic">Dictionnaire philosophique</span> and other writings. It mounted a defence of Sephardic Jews and their position in Europe rather than the northern European Ashkenazi or of Judaism in general. Pinto was a secular thinker, but a conservative deist opposed to the militant atheism and materialism of some writers of the French Enlightenment. These views were expressed in his <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;cis des arguments contre les mat&eacute;rialistes</span> (The Hague, 1774). With strong Orangeist sympathies intact throughout his life he remained a friend of Britain and criticized the American revolutionaries in their struggle against British rule in a number of pamphlets. Later in life, following a period of residence in Paris and travels to England, he settled in the Jewish community at The Hague, Netherlands, where he died on 13 August 1787; he was buried there in the Jewish cemetery.<br>
