<span class="headword">Stubbe <span class="st"> [Stubbs]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1541&#150;1590), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was born possibly in Norfolk, the eldest of three sons and four daughters of John Stubbe (<i>fl</i>. 1541&#150;1554), a country gentleman of Buxton, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1540&#150;1590). Nothing is known of his education until he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 12 November 1555. At Cambridge he was tutored by George Blythe, and knew both Vincent Skinner and Michael Hickes; all three men were later to be secretaries to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Stubbe graduated BA on 31 January 1561 and entered Lincoln's Inn on 7 November 1562, where he was later joined by Skinner and Hickes (admitted 1565), William Lambarde, Ralph Rokeby, and others. His translation <span class="italic">A discourse &hellip; conteyning in briefe the historie of the life and death of Maister Iohn Calvin</span>, from the French of the theologian Theodore Beza, was published two years later.<br>
<br>Stubbe's time at Lincoln's Inn was formative. With Skinner, Hickes, Rokeby, and others he formed a close-knit group of protestants; some friendships lasted until Stubbe's death. Witnessing the suspensions of a number of London clergymen by Archbishop Parker after the vestarian controversy (1565&#150;6), this group increasingly identified with those, like John Field and Thomas Wilcox, who demanded further reforms to the religious settlement of 1559, particularly the eradication of such practices as the wearing of surplices and kneeling at communion. In 1569 Skinner dedicated his translation of Gonsalvius, <span class="italic">A discovery and playne declaration of sundry subtill practises of the holye inquisition of Spayne</span>, to Parker in laudatory terms. But, though there is no firm evidence, it is thought that five years later Stubbe, Skinner, and Hickes may have collaborated in a vituperative attack on Parker entitled <span class="italic">The Life of the 70. Archbishopp off Canterbury. Englished</span>, a translation of the final chapter of <span class="italic">De antiquitate Britannicae ecclesiae</span> with polemical and satirical marginal notes. Much of the criticism levelled against the archbishop concerned Parker's hostility to the moderate puritans' concerns and the defence of episcopacy in <span class="italic">De antiquitate Britannicae ecclesiae</span>. Though Stubbe was moving among prominent puritans at this time&#151;his sister Alice married Thomas Cartwright in 1578&#151;typographical evidence suggests <span class="italic">The Life</span> was produced independently, and was not part of a larger propaganda campaign. It is significant that it was printed in Z&uuml;rich by Christoph Froschauer, not by Michael Shirat (Heidelberg), who printed a number of important protestant works by Thomas Cartwright and Walter Travers at this time.<br>
<br>Stubbe was called to the bar on 2 February 1572 (along with Sir Thomas Egerton) and may have practised. He was appointed steward for the reader's dinner at Lincoln's Inn in August 1578&#151;a senior post&#151;though this may have been recognition of long residence: it was alleged that he wrote <span class="italic">The Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf</span> at the inn. Some time between 1575 and 1579 Stubbe married Anne, daughter of Aubrey Vere and widow of Christopher Sharnborne of Norfolk. As the wills of Aubrey and Anne show, the couple had no children; though mention is made in Aubrey's to his stepson Francis Sharnborne. Stubbe's brother Francis married Anne, sister of Sir Edward Coke; she corresponded with Cartwright on the issue of separatism in 1590.<br>
<br>In August 1579 Stubbe wrote <span class="italic">The Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf</span>, objecting to Elizabeth's proposed marriage with the duke of Anjou. He attacked the marriage on the grounds that it was against God's law for a protestant to marry a Catholic; he also answered in detail all the points the earl of Sussex had made in support of the marriage, both in a letter to Elizabeth in August 1578 and in a later memorandum. It has been argued that Leicester or Walsingham supplied Stubbe with Sussex's arguments to engineer popular opposition to the match; this was certainly what Elizabeth thought. It is difficult to trace close connections between either man and Stubbe, but the book was printed by Hugh Singleton, who also printed the first edition of Edmund Spenser's <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calendar</span>. Spenser was a member of Leicester's household at this time, and his poem, too, was critical of the marriage.<br>
<br>Elizabeth was incensed by <span class="italic">A Gaping Gulf</span>: Stubbe had no claim to offer counsel, his criticism of Anjou was vituperative, and he openly questioned her commitment to protestantism. On 27 September 1579 a royal proclamation was issued prohibiting the circulation of the book. On 13 October Stubbe, Singleton, and William Page (secretary to the earl of Bedford and an MP who had attempted to distribute fifty copies to Sir Richard Grenville in the west country) were arrested. Elizabeth wanted to hang them by royal prerogative but agreed to their trial for felony. The jury refused to convict, and they were charged with conspiring to excite sedition under 1 &amp; 2 Philip &amp; Mary c. 3 and retried in queen's bench. The use of this statute was criticized by Robert Monson, a judge of common pleas and member of Lincoln's Inn; he was imprisoned and removed from the bench when he refused to retract. The three men were sentenced to have their right hands cut off and to be imprisoned, though it appears that Singleton was pardoned because of his age: he was about eighty. The sentence was carried out at the market place in Westminster, with surgeons present to prevent them bleeding to death. Camden's eye-witness account, also printed by Harington and circulated in manuscript, recounts Stubbe's speech on the scaffold: he asserted his loyalty and asked the crowd to pray that God would give him strength to endure the punishment. After his hand was chopped off (it took three blows) he managed to cry out &#145;God save the queen&#146; before he fainted and was carried away. The crowd watched in absolute silence&#151;either, Camden believed, in horror of the punishment and pity for Stubbe, or out of hatred of the marriage. Stubbe subsequently signed his name &#145;John Stubbe, scaeva&#146; (&#145;the left-handed&#146;).<br>
<br>Stubbe remained in the Tower until 1581, the year in which parliament passed the <span class="roman">Act against Seditious Words and Rumours Uttered against the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty</span>. Though designed as an anti-Catholic measure, opposition in the Commons appears to have been stimulated by fears that it could be used against protestants, like Stubbe. The following year, Stubbe's <span class="italic">Christian Meditations upon Eight Psalms</span> (dedicated to Lady Anne Bacon) was printed at Bacon House by Christopher Barker. In 1585 he became steward of Great Yarmouth and, four years later, its MP. In parliament he sat on four committees (including privileges and the subsidy) and drew up a draft petition against the use of the <i>ex officio</i> oath against puritan ministers. The circumstances surrounding the petition are unclear, but it appears to have been part of an attempt to initiate religious reform at the end of the session after earlier attempts had failed. However, there does not appear to have been time to present either it or another petition to Elizabeth. In 1587 Burghley commissioned him to reply to Cardinal Allen's attack on Burghley's own <span class="italic">Execution of Justice</span>, a treatise defending the regime's proceedings against Edmund Campion; there is no evidence, however, that Stubbe's work was published. At the same time, Stubbe was appointed an associate of the bench at Lincoln's Inn, an honorary benchership which enabled him to advise on the running of the inn. From 1585 he was also employed as secretary to Lord Willoughby de Eresby, and may have resided at Willoughby's house at the Barbican while Willoughby was abroad. He acted as a channel of communication between Willoughby and Burghley on Dutch affairs, as well as overseeing Willoughby's household and financial affairs. He also accompanied Lady Willoughby to the Low Countries in 1588.<br>
<br>After the dissolution of parliament in 1589, Stubbe went to France with the English force, where he died in February the following year; his will, written in haste before his departure for France, was proved on 27 June 1590. Stubbe left the wardship of his stepson and most of his property and possessions to his &#145;faithfull and righte well deserving&#146; wife, who later married Anthony Stapley. Some things (including a gold ring engraved &#145;Mortall&#146;) were left to his mother, and he released his brother, Edmond, from a debt of &pound;60. The promised schedule of legacies to kin and friends does not appear to have been made. He testified that he &#145;lyved and do dye the true man and most loyall Subjecte of her most excellente majestie&#146;, beseeching Elizabeth to show her grace and favour to his widow  (PROB 11/75, fols. 313&#150;314). His burial, on the seashore near Havre de Grace, was witnessed by three nephews of his old friend Ralph Rokeby.<br>
