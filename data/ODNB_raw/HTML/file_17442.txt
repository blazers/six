<span class="headword">Macdonald, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1850), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was distantly connected with Flora Macdonald, the Jacobite heroine. His military service began as an ensign in the 89th foot (15 April 1795), advancing in that regiment to lieutenant (2 February 1796) and captain (22 October 1802). He served with the 89th in Ireland during the 1798 rising, taking part in several encounters, including those at Ross and Vinegar Hill. After brief periods in garrison on Minorca and at Messina, the regiment took part in the siege of Valletta and capture of Malta (1799&#150;1800). Macdonald also fought with it in Egypt in 1801, during the opposed landing on the 8th, skirmish on the 13th, and battle of Alexandria on 21 March, after which he received the military general service medal with campaign bar. On 28 February 1805 he became a half-pay major and shortly afterwards served as brigade major to Lieutenant-General Lord Cathcart in England before securing a majority in the 43rd foot (20 February 1806). He accompanied Cathcart as his military secretary when he commanded the King's German Legion in Swedish Pomerania during 1806&#150;7, earning Cathcart's special praise. Macdonald acted in the same capacity with Cathcart during the expedition to Denmark and bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807. He became a half-pay lieutenant-colonel in the 1st garrison battalion on 17 March 1808, and the following year acted as deputy adjutant-general for Lieutenant-General the Hon. Sir John Hope's reserve, tasked to clear the enemy from south Beveland during the disastrous Walcheren expedition. On 24 February 1810 Macdonald was appointed deputy adjutant-general under Lieutenant-General Thomas Graham in southern Spain, first at Cadiz and then during the battle of Barossa (5 March 1811), where his &#145;unwearied exertions&#146; were mentioned in dispatches  (Forbes, 277). Towards the close of the action, Macdonald decisively ordered the 67th foot to clear enemy artillery from a prominent ridge dominating the British position.<br>
<br>In March 1812 Macdonald became military secretary to Hope, commander-in-chief in Ireland, and from 25 September 1813 acted as his assistant adjutant-general in the Peninsula, taking part in the battle of the Nive (10 November 1813) and blockade of Bayonne early in 1814. When Hope was wounded and taken prisoner during an enemy sortie on 14 April 1814, Macdonald obtained permission to enter the French city to look after him. For his services in the Peninsula, Macdonald received a gold medal with one clasp for Barossa and the Nive.<br>
<br>Macdonald became a brevet colonel and CB (4 June 1814), and from 14 August 1818 served for almost twelve years as assistant adjutant-general at the Horse Guards in London under three successive commanders-in-chief of the army, the dukes of York and Wellington and Lord Hill. Hill remained in office until 1842, when Wellington returned as commander-in-chief. Meanwhile, Macdonald had been promoted to adjutant-general (27 July 1830), and would retain that post until his death, representing continuous service at the Horse Guards of over thirty-one years, advancing to major-general (27 May 1835) and lieutenant-general (28 June 1838). He was appointed KCB (13 September 1831) and GCB (24 September 1847). As adjutant-general, Macdonald was directly responsible to the commander-in-chief for military discipline in the cavalry and infantry (the ordnance forces then being a separate command under the master-general of the ordnance), and, after consulting the judge-advocate-general, advised him on courts martial. The adjutant-general arranged the passage of troops going overseas, dealt with problems of inter-regimental transfers, and supervised the establishment of regimental schools. He exercised responsibility for army clothing, taking note of the recommendations of the board of general officers appointed to oversee it, and ensured the supply of small arms to all regiments. His responsibilities in these matters extended to reserve forces (militia, yeomanry, and enrolled pensioners), and all military commanders in the United Kingdom and abroad (whether in garrison or on campaign) submitted regular reports to him. Scotland had a deputy adjutant-general in Edinburgh; Ireland, foreign stations, and overseas expeditions had their own adjutant-general. However, all these officers were answerable to the Horse Guards, as were assistant adjutants-general in military districts at home, who were appointed on the adjutant-general's recommendation. Questioned by Lord Ebrington's select committee on army and navy appointments in 1833, Macdonald explained that such a vast amount of work had been acquired since expansion of colonial possessions post-1815, that &#145;the great variety of details&#146; prevented him from giving a comprehensive summary of departmental responsibilities  (Sweetman, 81). By 1836 the establishment at the Horse Guards comprised four officers with subordinate military and civilian staff; ten years later its cost amounted to almost &pound;13,000 per year. One enduring legacy of Macdonald's time as adjutant-general was outlined by the commander-in-chief's general order of 1 January 1836: &#145;An account of the services of every regiment in the British army shall be published under the superintendence of the adjutant-general&#146;  (Cannon, preface).<br>
<br>Macdonald proved an able and effective adjutant-general: &#145;His official demeanour was courteous and kind, and his sincerity and candour were seldom found to border on abruptness or roughness, and never on rudeness or insult&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval and Military Gazette</span>, 30 March 1850). Macdonald was also a clear writer of minutes and orders. He had been appointed colonel of the 67th foot (25 August 1828), then of the 42nd foot (15 March 1844). He died at his residence in Bruton Street, London, on 28 March 1850, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
