<span class="headword">Williams,  Marjorie Agnes  Watson-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Paule V&eacute;zelay]</span>  (1892&#150;1984), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at 14 Westbourne Place, Clifton, Bristol, on 14 May 1892, the second of the five children of Patrick Watson-Williams MD (1861&#150;1938), an ear, nose, and throat specialist and a keen amateur artist, and Margaret Long Fox (1865&#150;1952), who came from a Quaker family and was a niece of the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32028/', "F. H. Bradley")</script>. Marjorie was educated at Clifton High School for Girls, Bristol (1905&#150;9), and at art school in Bristol (1909&#150;12). From 1912 to 1914 she studied at the London School of Art under George Belcher, a draughtsman for <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and also attended evening classes in lithography at Chelsea Polytechnic in London. Her illustrations in 1916 for <span class="italic">A Diary of the Great Warr</span>, published under the pseudonym &#145;Saml Pepys, junr&#146;, led to a commission to write and illustrate five articles on London life for the journal <span class="italic">Drawing and Design</span>. At this time her black and white drawings were figurative and often humorous.<br>
<br>Watson-Williams's mature work as a painter dates almost entirely from her first visit to Paris in 1920, an experience of crucial importance and inspiration to her. Her paintings developed rapidly from a late form of impressionism into a more boldly simplified style. Many of these early works, both paintings and prints, were based on scenes in restaurants, theatres, and circuses. Her first one-woman exhibition in London was at the Dorien Leigh Galleries in 1921, and in 1922 she joined the London Group.<br>
<br>In 1926 Watson-Williams decided to settle in Paris and she adopted the name Paule V&eacute;zelay. There she met many of the leading artists, including Henri Matisse, Joan Mir&oacute;, Wassily Kandinsky, and Juan Gris, and exhibited regularly at the Salon des Surind&eacute;pendants. In 1928 she met the surrealist Andr&eacute; Masson (1896&#150;1987) and their passionate relationship lasted until 1932. During this period she painted a few semi-surrealist pictures but also produced her first abstract works in which the subject matter dissolved away. In 1934 she was invited to join the Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation group and she began a lifelong friendship with Jean Arp and Sophie Taeuber-Arp. Her paintings evolved from recognizable shapes which floated and danced in space, and became entirely abstract, with flat planes of colour and clear-cut forms. Typical of this period are <span class="italic">Strange Landscape</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">Worlds in Space</span> (1935). She also made a few small sculptures in plaster. However, her most personal and original contribution to the abstract movement was her series of constructions known as lines in space, consisting of shallow wooden boxes strung with threads and later with coloured wires: works which are delicate and playful, the shadows cast by the lines adding to the effect. The exhibition of these at the Galerie Jeanne-Bucher in Paris in 1937 helped to reinforce Paule V&eacute;zelay's growing reputation; and in 1938 and 1939 her work was included in several major surveys of abstract art in Milan, Amsterdam, and Paris. The outbreak of war in September 1939 came, therefore, at a crucial moment in her career.<br>
<br>V&eacute;zelay returned to England and spent much of the war in Bristol, seldom able to paint. Her works included a few unofficial war drawings, particularly of barrage balloons&#151;objects which resembled the abstract shapes which so fascinated her. Unable to gain a foothold in post-war Paris, she moved to 60 Redcliffe Square, London, where from 1952 to 1957 she devoted time and effort to founding a British branch of the Groupe Espace. In 1957 she made her final home at 12 Beverley Close, Barnes, London. Here she produced textile designs for Heal Fabrics Limited (1955&#150;67) and was elected a fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists in 1958. Apart from exhibitions in London at the Leicester Galleries (1954) and the Grosvenor Gallery (1968), V&eacute;zelay felt extremely isolated at this time. In the 1970s and 1980s she made delicate pastels and collages, and finally works which had no forms but simply colour, space, and light. Her work was exhibited in a few galleries in New York and London, notably by Annely Juda Fine Arts. Finally, at the age of ninety-one, she was accorded a retrospective exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1983. This followed a BBC2 television programme, <span class="italic">Women of our Century</span>, in which she represented the artist in that distinguished group. Both these events helped to alleviate her lack of recognition in Britain and the loneliness of her last four decades.<br>
<br>Marcel Brion credits Paule V&eacute;zelay with &#145;a completely original and independent conception for the expression of form in space&#146;  (Brion, 302&#150;4), and the critic Josef Paul Hodin, in an unpublished essay of 1975, calls her &#145;a master of classical abstraction&#146;. In the catalogue of the 1983 Tate Gallery retrospective exhibition Ronald Alley states that she was one of the first British artists to commit themselves totally and irrevocably to the abstract movement  (Alley, 13). Her works are represented in the major collections in Britain. Her self-portrait <span class="italic">Harmony</span> (1927&#150;9) and her painting of <span class="italic">Goossens Rehearsing Richard Tauber</span> (1925) are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Her published articles include &#145;Juan Gris&#146;  (<span class="italic">Artwork</span>, 4/16, 1928, 258&#150;61) and &#145;Jean Arp&#146;  (<span class="italic">World Review</span>, Sept 1949, 61&#150;4), and she left an unpublished manuscript entitled &#145;Drawing and composition&#146;  (Tate collection, archives, Paule V&eacute;zelay MSS).<br>
<br>Paule V&eacute;zelay dressed stylishly. Although reserved, she could appear intimidating, feeling at a disadvantage in a man's world and especially in the sphere of commerce. She was, however, a generous friend and an excellent correspondent. She enjoyed entertaining and designed her own garden, and her extensive library included many philosophical works. She lived alone and still worked indomitably up until her death at the age of ninety-one, after a short illness, at Barnes Hospital, Mortlake, London, on 20 March 1984. She was cremated at Mortlake crematorium on 29 March.<br>
