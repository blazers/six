<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Astley,  Jacob</span>, first Baron Astley of Reading  (1579&#150;1652), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the eighth child, and second surviving son, of Isaac Astley (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1598) of Melton Constable, Norfolk, and his wife, Mary Waldegrave (<i>fl</i>. 1579&#150;1645), daughter of Edward Waldegrave of Lawford, Essex. The Astley family were of Warwickshire origin, but had long settled in Norfolk and elsewhere, and contributed several of their number to the county magistracy.<h2>
<a name="Continentalservice"></a>Continental service</h2>The young Jacob, however, small of stature, opted for a life of greater adventure, and at the age of eighteen volunteered to join the Azores expedition in 1597 under the earl of Essex and Sir Walter Ralegh. Thereafter he was almost continually involved in the wars on the continent. He was probably among the English troops under Sir Francis Vere who took part in Prince Maurice of Nassau's bloody battle with the Spanish at Nieuport (June 1600). The severe casualties among the English allowed Maurice to fill vacancies in his forces: Astley gained a commission.<br>
<br>It seems likely that Astley retained command of a company in the Anglo-Dutch brigade thereafter. Like other long-serving foreign soldiers in the brigade he settled into local society, marrying a Dutch heiress, Agnes Impel of Bloumerckem, at some time before 1619. Two sons and a daughter were born of this marriage. He must have attracted the attention of the family of the exiled elector palatine, resident at The Hague after 1621, for he joined their household. The elector's queen, Elizabeth of Bohemia, referred to him familiarly as &#145;honest little Jacob&#146;, or even &#145;little monkey&#146;, and invited him &#145;like a little ape to skip over quickly&#146; to her side  (Baker, 73, 83). It was said that he gave military instruction to the queen's young son, Prince Rupert, at this time. He obtained further recognition, this time from Elizabeth's father, James I, when he was knighted during a royal progress of the east midlands on 17 July 1624. With the onset of a general European conflict, in which for half a decade England participated, Astley saw active service in the Palatinate and with Dutch forces in Germany, and in the campaigns fought there by Christian IV of Denmark in 1626&#150;7 and Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1629&#150;32.<h2>
<a name="Thebishopswars"></a>The bishops' wars</h2>Astley's skill and experience, especially in the management of infantry, had been acquired under several distinguished commanders in some of the best schools of warfare in Europe, and he was now in demand. His good service to the king's sister no doubt persuaded Charles I, when the Scottish wars broke out, to invite him home. He was appointed governor of Plymouth Fort (and his younger son, Bernard, captain) on 3 December 1638, sergeant-major-general of the field, in command of the foot, and given charge of the defences of the midlands and most of the north, including the border towns and main strongholds. Asked to make a military survey of the region he painted a bleak picture of the war readiness of these counties, and drew up plans for the better fortification of key towns such as Hull and Newcastle, working closely with William Legge. Astley was consulted on technical matters by the council of war that took charge of the military response to the Scots. No doubt his long-standing contacts with Dutch arms suppliers aided his successful negotiations with them in 1638&#150;9 for the provision of weapons for the English army. By the end of 1639 he was a full member of the king's council of war. His portrait, in armour, was painted by Van Dyck.<br>
<br>For the second bishops' war in the summer of 1640 Astley was reappointed sergeant-major-general and may also have been governor of Newcastle. From York he reported at length on the bad state of the recruits drawn from the southern counties' trained bands for the army in the north. The men he inspected were good-bodied but unruly. Several units had mutinied and one had murdered its officer. They contained, he wrote, &#145;all the arch knaves of this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1640</i>, 461&#150;2). When their pay and clothing failed he was besieged in his headquarters and could restore order only by executing the leading mutineers. Now in his sixties, and suffering &#145;a shrewd sickness&#146;, he found himself &#145;over toiled&#146; with duties  (ibid., <i>1640&#150;41</i>, 325). He escaped any blame for the fall of Newcastle to the Scots, however, and was successful in keeping the army together until its disbandment.<br>
<br>Astley also avoided any implication in the army plots of 1641, so that the Long Parliament had no reason to discriminate against him when sides were chosen in the summer of 1642. Most of his Norfolk cousins and their neighbouring gentry stayed in their posts as county &#145;governors&#146;, carrying out the orders of parliament. Some were to serve on the ruling body of the eastern association during the civil war. Astley chose otherwise. Although no record of it survives, his commission as sergeant-major-general must have been among the first issued by Charles I in early July 1642. It fell to him, therefore, to embody the many infantry units, enthusiastic but largely untrained and unarmed, and led by military amateurs, which flocked to the royal banner in the following months.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwar"></a>The civil war</h2>By the time of the first major battle of the war&#151;Edgehill on 23 October 1642&#151;Astley led an infantry arm some 10,000 strong, disposed in five tertias or brigades, each of about three regiments. The good rapport with his men he enjoyed (and his simple piety) were well exemplified by his prayer before the battle: &#145;O Lord! thou knowest how busy I must be this day; if I forget thee, do not thou forget me &hellip; March on, boys!&#146;  (P. Warwick, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of King Charles the First</span>, 1813, 252). By all accounts the royalist foot behaved with great courage, though unprotected by Rupert's cavalry and assaulted by enemy horse and foot together, sticking their colours in the ground and refusing to give way, until nightfall. Two of the five brigades were heavily mauled, and Astley himself was wounded.<br>
<br>When the king set up his headquarters at Oxford in November he made Astley governor. The infantry occupied the city and the surrounding towns and villages. Astley was a leading member of the king's council of war, attending thirty-three of the fifty-four meetings where membership is recorded. His advice carried weight, as Clarendon wrote, for he was &#145;an honest, brave, plain man &hellip; and was so generally esteemed &hellip; In council he used few but very pertinent words, and was not at all pleased with the long speeches usually made there&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.346&#150;7). With the start of the summer's campaign he was replaced as governor (April 1643) to enable him to lead the field army foot, first to Reading, then to the siege of Gloucester in August. Candles for the miners tunnelling under the city's defences were delivered to his headquarters up to the moment when the city was relieved by the earl of Essex's forces in early September. At the indecisive battle of Newbury the royal cavalry rather than the infantry played the more prominent role. Astley assembled his troops at Reading after the battle, and was appointed governor of the town in October. He dealt with a mutiny among the garrison troops there as he had in the Scottish wars, by executing the ringleaders.<br>
<br>Reading was, controversially, abandoned in May 1644, and the foot freed to pursue Essex's army into Cornwall during the summer. &#145;The vigilant care&#146; of Astley played a major role in trapping the enemy forces and forcing the surrender of the parliamentarian infantry at Lostwithiel in September 1644  (R. Symonds, <span class="italic">Diary of the Royal Marches</span>, ed. Long and Roy, 1997, 55). At the concluding encounter of the campaign, second Newbury, the foot played an important part at both ends of the battlefield in stoutly resisting attacks by superior numbers. Astley was created Baron Astley of Reading on 4 November 1644. Both his sons, Isaac and Bernard, were actively engaged for the king, and both were knighted during the war. His only daughter, Elizabeth, however, was married to her cousin Sir Edward Astley, who remained a leading parliamentarian in Norfolk.<br>
<br>The new commander-in-chief of the royalist army was now Astley's disciple Prince Rupert. In the course of 1645, the year of final defeat for the king and of bitter recriminations among his leading supporters, no hint of any conflict between Astley and Rupert, or any other general, has surfaced. If he doubted the decision to engage the enemy at Naseby, on 14 June 1645, he kept it to himself. At the battle the foot in the centre, &#145;according to their usual custom &hellip; falling in with their swords and the but-ends of their muskets &hellip; did very notable execution&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.44). But as at Edgehill, the first battle, so now at the decisive final one the 4000 royalist infantrymen found themselves surrounded by both horse and foot in overwhelming numbers. After a heroic resistance they were forced to surrender, almost to a man. Lord Astley survived the destruction of his forces, and in December accepted the king's command to take control of the four English counties on the Welsh border, where the remaining royalist war effort was in disarray. His still potent authority restored some order, and he was able to lead a force of about 3000 horse and foot from Worcester in an attempt to join the king at Oxford. He got no further than Stow on the Wold, where on 21 March 1646 he was defeated, and captured by a stronger parliamentarian army. Facing his captors he said, prophetically: &#145;You have now done your work and may go play, unless you will fall out amongst yourselves&#146;  (J. Rushworth, <span class="italic">Historical Collections</span>, 8 vols., 1721&#150;2, 6.140).<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Astley was moved to Warwick Castle but was comprehended in the articles of surrender of Oxford in June. This meant that when in 1648 he came to compound for what he claimed was his modest estate of &pound;200 per annum he paid a fine of a tenth. He and his family were now resident with his daughter at her house, Hindolveston, in Norfolk. His mother had escaped from Bristol just before it surrendered in September 1645, and there too his son Bernard had been mortally wounded. Astley took no part in the risings of the summer of 1648&#151;he was now sixty-nine&#151;but was arrested and imprisoned three years later in the general panic caused by the Scottish invasion of England. He was briefly held in Leeds Castle, Kent, then the Fleet prison in London, until bailed for large sums.<br>
<br>Despite these disturbances Astley spent the last years of his life quietly at the Old Palace, Maidstone, Kent, a house and estate inherited from another Astley cousin who had also been a servant of Elizabeth of Bohemia. Distant from his remaining family in Norfolk, he took pleasure in corresponding with his daughter and her young son, also named Jacob. The rough old veteran showed himself tender-hearted, gently chiding Elizabeth for proposing to send the ten-year-old to distant grammar school in Norwich: &#145;Full littell thincke you how his bumbe will suffer, for they ar all churlish masters thear&#146;  (Ketton-Cremer, <span class="italic">Three Generations</span>, 27&#150;8). He died on 27 February 1652, survived by his wife, and was buried under an elaborate monument in Maidstone church, which recites his many exploits.<br>
<br>Astley is one of the best-known figures of the English civil war, if only for his famous prayer before Edgehill. A career soldier of great skill and experience, he gained as much honour at home as he had previously abroad. He occupied for the royalists a role similar to that of Philip Skippon, another Norfolk man, for parliament: they were both veteran infantrymen, trained in the Dutch school, largely non-political but unswerving in devotion to their respective causes. Honest, trustworthy, and God-fearing, they inspired loyalty in their subordinates, won the respect of their enemies, recruited converts, and rose above the petty squabbles which marked the progress of their parties during the war.<br>
