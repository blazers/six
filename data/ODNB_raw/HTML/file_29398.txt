<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilde <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elgee]</span>,  Jane Francesca Agnes</span>, Lady Wilde <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Speranza]</span>  (1821&#150;1896), <span class="occ">writer and Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 27 December 1821 in Dublin, the last of the four children of Charles Elgee (1783&#150;1824), attorney, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of Thomas Kingsbury, commissioner of bankruptcy. Her parents were both Irish. Her early years are unrecorded. She dismissed enquiries into her date of birth and birthplace as impertinence, saying &#145;There is no register of my birth in existence. It was not the fashion then, nor compulsory in Ireland as it is now&#146;  (letter, priv. coll.). She juggled with her birth date (as her son Oscar was to do) and wove romantic mysteries about her background. Asserting, for example, that Elgee was a corruption of the Italian name Algiati, she went on to claim relationship with the poet Dante Alighieri. Jane's father died in India (his reason for going there is unknown) and where and how Sarah Elgee and her children lived after his death is uncertain. Jane was well educated, becoming fluent in French, German, and Italian, and well-grounded in Greek and the classics.<br>
<br>Despite her respectable, protestant background, Jane allied herself in her twenties with the revolutionary Young Ireland movement. In 1846 she began contributing rousing nationalistic poetry and prose to its weekly journal, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. She did so under the pseudonym of Speranza, to avoid family wrath. An inflammatory leader she wrote for the 29 July 1848 edition, &#145;Jacta alea est&#146; (&#145;The die is cast&#146;), while the editor, Charles Duffy, was in prison, called for armed insurrection (&#145;Oh, for a hundred thousand muskets&#146;), and caused an uproar. The journal was shut down for sedition. Jane's verse expressed anger at the causes and effects of the great famine. Emotional poems such as &#145;The Stricken Land&#146;, in which she attacked the English for taking Irish corn (&#145;Weary men, what reap ye?&#151;Golden corn for the stranger&#146;), &#145;Courage&#146; (&#145;Lift up your pale faces, ye children of sorrow&#146;), and the compassionate, &#145;The Voice of the Poor&#146; (&#145;Before us die our brothers of starvation; around are cries of famine and despair&#146;) fired audiences throughout Ireland. When her son Oscar toured America in 1882, he was welcomed by the Irish there not as the famous aesthete, but as &#145;Speranza's boy&#146;.<br>
<br>Jane's appearance was striking: nearly 6 feet tall, she had a Junoesque figure, good features, long blue-black hair, and expressive brown eyes. An admirer, Sir William Rowan Hamilton, astronomer royal for Ireland and world-renowned mathematician, found her &#145;almost amusingly fearless and original&#146; who &#145;likes to make a sensation&#146;  (Hamilton letters, NL Ire., 905). Although she claimed that &#145;a Joan of Arc was never meant for marriage&#146;  (MS letter, November 1852, U. Reading L.), Jane married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29403/', "Dr William Robert Wills Wilde (1815&#150;1876)")</script> on 12 November 1851. They had three children: William Charles Kingsbury (<i>b</i>. 1852), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29400/', "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wilde (1854&#150;1900)")</script>, and Isola Francesca Emily (1857&#150;1867). Despite a self-mocking cry of &#145;Behold Speranza making gruel&#146;  (MS letter, November 1854, U. Reading L.), she adored her children, and gave her family absolute support and loyalty all her life.<br>
<br>Jane's Saturday salon or <i>Conversazione</i> was famous. The Wildes' house in Dublin's Merrion Square, according to the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, &#145;was known as the house where a guest met all the Dublin celebrities in literature, art and the drama&#146;  (11 March 1878). Jane disliked &#145;the fatal miasma of the commonplace&#146;  (Lady Wilde, <span class="italic">Notes on Men, Women and Books</span>, 1891). A friend, Henriette Corkran, remembered her as hostess looking like a tragedy queen in a long crimson silk gown with flounces of Limerick lace, a vast crinoline, floating scarves, a gilt crown of laurels, and so many portrait-brooches she resembled a &#145;walking family mausoleum&#146;  (Corkran, 137&#150;8). Emulating writer Charles Maturin, her uncle by marriage, she entertained in rooms darkened by closed shutters and lit only by dim, red-shaded lamps.<br>
<br>Jane was an early, fervent, and constant advocate of women's rights: campaigning for better education for women; inviting the suffragist Millicent Fawcett to her home to speak on female liberty; and criticizing the different moral codes for men and women. She praised the passing of the <span class="roman">Married Women's Property Act</span>, 1883, preventing women from having to enter marriage &#145;as a bond slave, disenfranchised of all rights over her fortune&#146;  (Lady Wilde, &#145;A new era in English and Irish social life&#146;, <span class="italic">Gentlewoman</span>, January 1883).<br>
<br>Jane, with her linguistic ability, became a translator of importance: her first publication was <span class="italic">Sidonia the Sorceress</span> (a German terror-tale by J. W. Meinhold, 1849) which was Oscar's favourite childhood reading. Two translations from Alphonse de Lamartine followed: <span class="italic">Pictures of the First French Revolution</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">The Wanderer and his Home</span> (1851). Then there was <span class="italic">The Glacier Land</span> (from Alexandre Dumas p&egrave;re, 1852); <span class="italic">The Future Life</span> (from Emanuel Swedenborg, 1853); and finally <span class="italic">The First Temptation</span> (from Wilhelmine Canz, 1863).<br>
<br>Dr Wilde was knighted in January 1864. But the celebrations this provoked, together with Jane's first published collection, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, were followed by a series of disasters. That year Sir William and Lady Wilde were the principals in a sensational Dublin court case regarding a young woman called Mary Travers with whom Sir William had become involved. Then, in 1867, Isola died of fever at the age of nine. In 1871 the two illegitimate daughters of Sir William were burnt to death and in 1876 Sir William himself died. The family, shocked, found he was virtually bankrupt.<br>
<br>Jane left Dublin for London in 1879, to join her two sons. Oscar was establishing an artistic circle; her elder son, Willie, was a journalist. To earn money she began writing for publications such as the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Lady's Pictorial</span>. She recalled her travels with her husband in <span class="italic">Driftwood from Scandinavia</span> (1884), and drew on material left by Sir William, a notable folklorist, for her next two books: <span class="italic">Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms and Superstitions of Ireland</span> (1887), which W. B. Yeats called a &#145;most imaginative collection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of W. B. Yeats</span>), and <span class="italic">Ancient Cures, Charms and Usages of Ireland</span> (1890). Her last publications were collections of her articles: <span class="italic">Notes on Men, Women and Books</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Social Studies</span> (1893).<br>
<br>For most of her life in London, Lady Wilde lived with her eldest son in rented houses in Mayfair and Chelsea. She revived her weekly salon and guests included the Irish novelist George Moore; Bernard Shaw, who admitted &#145;Lady Wilde was nice to me in London&#146;; and W. B. Yeats&#151;who said of her that &#145;London has few better talkers&#146;  (W. B. Yeats, <span class="italic">Letters to the New Island</span>, 1970, 76&#150;7). Oscar attended her salons and the links between the two remained strong: she wrote constantly to him, treating him as her close confidant and signing her letters when depressed La Madre Dolorosa.<br>
<br>Lady Wilde successfully applied for a &pound;100 grant from the Royal Literary Fund in 1888 and received a civil-list pension of &pound;70 a year in 1890 in recognition of her husband's services to statistical science and literature. She lived in poverty, sometimes having to ask Oscar for money. He paid her most pressing bills but his involvement with Lord Alfred Douglas severely strained his income.<br>
<br>Lady Wilde never forgot Speranza's place in Ireland. After Oscar's overwhelming success she wrote to him only half-jokingly to say &#145;I suppose I shall now be known as the Mother of Oscar&#146;  (Lady Wilde to Oscar Wilde, William Andrews Clark Memorial Library). His arrest in 1895, his vilification in the papers and subsequent imprisonment, devastated her. She was to write, &#145;I only feel the agony and loss of all that made life endurable and my singing robes are trailed in London clay&#146;  (MS letter, New York Public Library, Berg Collection). Yet when friends urged Oscar to leave England, she told him: &#145;If you stay, even if you go to prison, you will always be my son, it will make no difference to my affection, but if you go, I will never speak to you again&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 289). Her Irish pride was strong. Her son must show moral courage.<br>
<br>The events took their toll. Lady Wilde contracted bronchitis in January 1896 and, failing, asked to see Oscar. Her request was refused. She died at her home, 146 Oakley Street, Chelsea, on 3 February 1896. Her elder son was penniless and Oscar paid for her funeral on 5 February at Kensal Green cemetery in London. A headstone proved too expensive and she was buried anonymously in common ground.<br>
