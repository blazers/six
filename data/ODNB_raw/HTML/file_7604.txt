<span class="headword">Dickinson,  Edmund</span>  (1624&#150;1707), <span class="occ">physician and alchemist</span>, was born at Appleton, Berkshire, on 26 September 1624, the son of the Revd William Dickinson (<i>d</i>. before 1649), rector of Appleton, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Edmund Colepepper. He was educated at Eton College, after which he entered Merton College, Oxford, in 1642, being admitted as one of the Eton postmasters. He became BA on 22 June 1647, and was elected probationer-fellow of Merton. He received the MA on 27 November 1649, after which he applied himself to medicine, and earned the MD on 3 July 1656. Soon after he was made the senior Linacre lecturer in medicine, and about 1663 began to practise medicine from a house in the High Street, Oxford.<br>
<br>About 1654 Dickinson had become involved with the Experimental Philosophy Club, a group of Oxford virtuosi which included Robert Boyle, Thomas Willis, Seth Ward, Jonathan Goddard, and many others with whom Dickinson continued to associate. His early interests centred on anatomy and physiology, but by the early 1660s he had turned towards chemistry, set up a laboratory, and employed an operator. The Danish polyhistor Olaus Borrichius visited Dickinson's laboratory during June or July 1663. Dickinson was elected an honorary fellow of the College of Physicians in December 1664, but was not formally admitted a fellow until 9 April 1677. He was also elected fellow of the Royal Society on 31 January 1678, but was completely inactive in that body and never formally admitted.<br>
<br>At Oxford Dickinson became proficient in many languages, including Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic&#151;languages which occur in all his major publications. These languages were the key to his first book, <span class="italic">Delphi Phoenicizantes</span> (1655), a philological and etymological attempt to show that Greek stories of Delphos and Apollo's battle with the Python were derived from Hebrew accounts of Joshua, and that Bacchus and Hercules were based on Moses and Joshua. The volume also contains notions about Noah's arrival in Italy, and the origin of the druids. This work made Dickinson widely known both at home and abroad. Wood  (<span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.90&#150;91) claims that the true author of this work was Henry Jacob, a Mertonian ejected at the 1648 visitation. According to Wood, Jacob left the completed manuscript in a locked book-chest, but his quarters were later given to Dickinson, who took possession of the chest and published the manuscript under his own name. There is no clear evidence for this assertion, and Wood was ill-disposed towards Dickinson, owing to a &pound;70 fine for the renewal of the lease on his family house, the imposition of which he blamed on Dickinson, then (1664) bursar of Merton.<br>
<br>In 1669 Dickinson married Elizabeth Luddington, who died giving birth to their only child, Elizabeth. She was buried in St Peter's Church, Oxford. Dickinson then married Helena Mole, who died soon after, without issue. Following the death of Thomas Willis in 1675, Dickinson acquired Willis's house in St Martin's Lane in London. Although Dickinson lived in that house until his death, it is not clear when he actually moved to London; various authorities suggest dates between 1675 and 1684, the latter date probably stemming from an erroneous date for Willis's death  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 5.176).<br>
<br>Among Dickinson's many patients was Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington, lord chamberlain, whom he cured of a serious tumour. Upon his recovery, Bennet recommended Dickinson to Charles II, who about 1677 appointed him physician-in-ordinary and physician to the royal household. The alchemist Johann Joachim Becher claims in the dedication of his <span class="italic">Tripus hermeticus fatidicus</span> that in 1680 Dickinson, as a court physician, helped Becher and introduced him to the court. Dickinson managed an alchemical laboratory, built under the royal bedchamber and accessible by a private staircase, where he performed experiments in the company of the king and George Villiers, duke of Buckingham. On the accession of James II in 1685, Dickinson was confirmed in his royal appointments, continuing there until James's deposition in 1688, whereupon he retired from practice.<br>
<br>Dickinson's long-term interest in transmutational alchemy began in Oxford, where he was visited about 1662 by a French adept known only as Theodore Mundanus. In 1678 or 1679 Mundanus visited Dickinson again and performed two transmutations before him. Dickinson's subsequent enquiries about alchemy addressed to Mundanus (dated London, 31 July 1683) were published in Oxford as <span class="italic">Epistola ad Mundanum de quintessentia philosophorum</span> (1686), together with Mundanus's response (dated Paris, 10 October 1684), translated from French into Latin. The French text survives in the British Library  (Sloane MS 3629, fols. 202&#150;229<i>v</i>). This volume achieved much popularity, appearing in three editions. Dickinson afterwards reiterated to John Evelyn his belief in the philosophers' stone and metallic transmutation. Robert Boyle chose Dickinson as one of the three executors of his chemical and alchemical papers, a task he attempted in 1692 after Boyle's death.<br>
<br>In his retirement Dickinson wrote his last work, <span class="italic">Physica vetus et vera</span>, which asserted the literal truth of the six days of creation, and presented a broad system of natural philosophy drawn from the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and contemporary corpuscularian theories. This lengthy work, some of which had to be rewritten after parts of the manuscript were accidentally burnt, was published in 1702. After suffering from bladder stones for over twenty years, Dickinson died at his house in St Martin's Lane on 3 April 1707. He was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields, where a large black marble monument with an elaborate inscription was erected on the east wall, following the dictates of his will, made on 11 September 1705.<br>
<br>Dickinson was survived by his daughter, Elizabeth, then wife of Charles John, Baron Blomberg, and his four grandsons. His youngest grandson, William Nicholas Blomberg (1702?&#150;1750), wrote a rambling biography of Dickinson; and, being in possession of his grandfather's papers, published in 1739 a manuscript by Dickinson on the Grecian games as an appendix to the biography's second edition.<br>
