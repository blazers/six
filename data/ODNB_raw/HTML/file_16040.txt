<span class="headword">Langton,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1337), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Chichester</span>, probably came from a family that had the lordship of the manor of West Langton in Leicestershire, and may have been related to the treasurer Walter Langton (<i>d</i>. 1321), whom John succeeded in the York prebend of Fridaythorpe in 1296. There is no record of university study, but in a letter from the chancellor of Oxford of <i>c</i>.1307&#150;1310 he is described as &#145;esteemed colleague&#146; (<i>confrater probatus</i>), and at the end of his life, in 1337, he founded a loan chest for deserving clerks at Oxford. He is first recorded in June 1278, when he became rector of Castle Sowerby, Cumberland, though only an acolyte. He may well have been the clerk of that name to whom Edward I gave two oak trees in March 1280. By May 1286 he was keeper of the rolls of chancery, the first person so to be titled. At the king's request he obtained a papal dispensation for pluralism in February 1291. He succeeded Robert Burnell (<i>d</i>. 1292) as chancellor in December 1292. The appointment may have caused some surprise&#151;the Dunstable annalist comments that until then Langton had been only a chancery clerk&#151;and the increased use of the privy seal from this date may indicate that he did not succeed to Burnell's influence; but his dissent from the policy pursued before the outbreak of war with France in 1294 was remarked upon, especially by the Worcester annalist.<br>
<br>The usual trawl of benefices accorded to Edward I's civil servants came Langton's way, and by 1294 he was treasurer of Wells. When the rich bishopric of Ely fell vacant in 1298, Edward I pushed hard to get him elected. But only a minority of the monks supported Langton, Archbishop Winchelsey was opposed, and, despite a visit to the curia between February and June 1299, Langton finally had his election quashed by the pope in June 1299. He was compensated with a dispensation to retain benefices&#151;sixteen in all&#151;to the value of &pound;1000, and also with the archdeaconry of Canterbury. Further conflict with Winchelsey broke out over the valuable rectory of Reculver, to which Langton had been presented by the king in 1293, but which he was eventually forced to surrender in 1302. However, Langton supported the archbishop in his dispute with St Augustine's, Canterbury.<br>
<br>For reasons that remain obscure Langton was dismissed from the chancellorship in August 1302. Yet on 5 April 1305 he was elected to the bishopric of Chichester. Consecrated at Canterbury on 19 September 1305, in the following month he participated in a high-level mission to the new pope, Clement V (<i>r</i>. 1305&#150;13), at Lyons. Following Edward II's accession, in August 1307, Langton regained his former post as chancellor, and was one of the bishops Winchelsey commissioned to crown the new king in his absence. In 1309 he was active on the king's council, and his presence at the Stamford parliament in July 1309, where the exile of Piers Gaveston was annulled, suggests support for the king. However, in March 1310 he was one of five bishops elected as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50153/', "lords ordainer")</script>, and this may account for his removal from the chancellorship on 11 May. The office remained unfilled until Walter Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1327) was appointed on 6 July. In the summer of 1311 Langton participated at the London trial of the templars.<br>
<br>At the Lincoln parliament in 1316 Langton was an auditor of petitions for England, and was sworn of the king's council. The earl of Lancaster at this time urged him to prosecute John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1347), for adultery, a course of action that in March 1315 Langton had been anxious to pass on to the archbishop of Canterbury. W. H. Blaauw, writing in 1853, contended that at some point Langton did excommunicate Warenne for adultery, and that in consequence the earl assaulted the bishop's officers, and was even himself imprisoned, but this cannot be substantiated. Langton took a large part in the negotiations between the king and Lancaster preceding the treaty of Leake of 1318 and was one of the standing council appointed as a result of the treaty. At the Westminster parliament of October 1320 he was again an auditor of petitions for England and Wales, while in July 1321 he was one of the bishops who mediated between the king and the barons.<br>
<br>Langton's role in public affairs decreased with age, although he was one of the commission appointed in July 1327 to give effect to the statute reversing the financial depredations of the Despenser regime. As a diocesan he vigorously contested royal attempts to convert the collegiate churches of Hastings and Bosham into royal free chapels, and in 1314 he annulled a statute of the dean and chapter on the grounds that it had been made without his permission; among its provisions was a prohibition of pluralism on the part of the cathedral vicars. He spent &pound;341 on the window in the south transept of Chichester Cathedral beneath which he is buried, and bequeathed &pound;100 to the cathedral fabric. A chantry was erected to him in the chapel of Sts Thomas of Canterbury and Edmund of Abingdon. He died shortly before 19 July 1337.<br>
