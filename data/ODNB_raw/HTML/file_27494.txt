<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Toft <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Denyer]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1703, <em>d.</em> 1763), <span class="occ">the rabbit-breeder</span>, daughter of John and Jane Denyer, was baptized at Godalming, Surrey, on 21 February 1703. She married Joshua Toft, a journeyman clothier, about 1720. They had three children, Mary, Anne, and James. Joshua, who followed a trade in which many, including himself, were chronically underemployed, provided little income for his family. Mary, an illiterate, was of small stature, with a healthy, strong constitution, and a sullen temper.<br>
<br>In August of 1726 Mary miscarried. On 27 September 1726 Mary, her husband, and her mother-in-law cut up a cat, removed its innards, inserted the backbone of an eel into the cat's intestines, and placed the creation in Mary's reproductive tract. Mary sent for a neighbour, Mary Gill, and after her arrival complained of great pains, feigned a brief labour, and was delivered of a &#145;monster&#146;. The &#145;monster&#146; was taken to John Howard, a surgeon practising midwifery in nearby Guildford. Howard claimed he would be convinced that &#145;the monster&#146; was an actual birth product only if the &#145;monstrous head&#146; was delivered. Mary obliged, and after a few days, was delivered of the head of a rabbit. Mary recalled that earlier, when five weeks pregnant, she was startled by a rabbit while working in the hop fields. Immediately she desired the rabbit for a meal, but was unable to catch the animal. Her cravings were further increased by a dream about rabbits, yet her longings remained unfulfilled. Four months later, she claimed to have been delivered of a strange misshapen piece of flesh. She made a similar delivery some three weeks later, at which time Howard was called.<br>
<br>As soon as Mary Toft was delivered of her first whole rabbit-headed monster, she fell into labour once again. By early November, with Howard in attendance, she was producing almost a rabbit a day. Toft was moved to Guildford so that Howard could more closely monitor the situation, and she soon gave birth to her ninth rabbit. Howard preserved the delivered products, all still births, in spirits, kept notes on the deliveries, and recorded the progress of events. Toft's case soon gained more than casual notice. Nathanael St Andr&eacute;, surgeon and anatomist to the royal household, and Samuel Molyneux, private secretary to the prince of Wales, took particular interest in this case. On 15 November they visited Howard, examined Toft, and witnessed her delivery of the fifteenth rabbit. After carefully comparing the pieces obtained from a series of deliveries, St Andr&eacute; was convinced of their authenticity, and he prepared an account of the matter which was subsequently published on 3 December as <span class="italic">A Short Narrative of an Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets, Perform'd by Mr John Howard Surgeon at Guilford</span>.<br>
<br>The Toft incident soon appeared in the periodical press, and Mary became the general talk of the town in London. George I dispatched Cyriacus Ahlers, surgeon to his majesty's German household, to investigate the matter. Ahlers arrived in Guildford on 20 November, and delivered part of a rabbit from Toft. Ever suspicious, Ahlers returned to London on 21 November and reported to the king that the births were a hoax. His published account, <span class="italic">Some Observations Concerning the Woman of Godlyman</span>, appeared on 8 December 1726. In an effort to resolve the controversial reports, George I dispatched the eminent London physician and man-midwife, Sir Richard Manningham, together with St Andr&eacute; and Phillupus van Limborch, a surgeon and man-midwife, to Guildford to review the situation and return with Toft who had, by this time, been delivered of a total of seventeen rabbits.<br>
<br>Toft reached London on 29 November, and was lodged in Lacy's Bagnio in Leicester Fields, where assorted members of the medical profession gathered to watch her next production. Although Toft underwent a series of violent contractions, no more rabbits were delivered. Besieged by a succession of men, including Manningham, the surgeon and anatomist James Douglas, justice of the peace Sir Thomas Clarges, the duke of Montagu, and Lord Baltimore, and threatened with &#145;a very painful experiment&#146; to uncover any secret, Toft confessed her imposture on 7 December. Charged as a &#145;notorious and vile cheat&#146;, she was sent to Bridewell in Tothill Fields on 9 December.<br>
<br>At least fifteen pamphlets and songs appeared following Toft's disclosure, satirizing what was portrayed as a mass delusion. Among these were: by a &#145;Gentleman at Guilford&#146;, <span class="italic">The wonder of wonders, or, A true and perfect narrative of a woman near Guilford in Surrey, who was delivered lately of seventeen rabbets and three legs of a tabby cat</span> (1726); <span class="italic">Doctors in labour: a philosophical enquiry into the wonderful coney-warren, lately discovered at Godalmin near Guilford in Surrey</span> (1726); <span class="italic">The Sooterkin Dissected</span> (1726); T. Brathwaite, <span class="italic">Remarks on a short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of rabbets, perform'd by Mr. John Howard, surgeon at Guilford</span> (1726); <span class="italic">The Doctor's in Labour, or, A New Whim Wham from Guildford</span> (1726); R. Manningham, <span class="italic">An exact diary of what was observ'd during a close attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended rabbet-breeder of Godalming in Surrey</span> (1726); J. Douglas, <span class="italic">An Advertisement Occasion'd by some Passages in Sir R. Manningham's Diary</span> (1727); <span class="italic">St. A&#150;D&#150;E's Miscarriage: a Full and True Account of the Rabbit Woman</span> (1727); Lemuel Gulliver, <span class="italic">The Anatomist Dissected, or, The Man-Midwife Finely Brought to Bed</span> (1727); <span class="italic">Much ado about nothing, or, A plain refutation of all that has been written or said concerning the rabbit-woman of Godalming</span> (1727); <span class="italic">The Discovery, or, The Squire Turned Ferret</span> (1727); and <span class="italic">St Andr&eacute;'s Miscarriage</span> (1727). Many of these works depicted Toft's surgical and medical attendants as gullible and credulous.<br>
<br>Toft was also parodied in several engravings, including William Hogarth's <span class="italic">The cunicularii, or, The wise men of Godliman in consultation</span> and, later, the second version of his engraving <span class="italic">Credulity, superstition, and fanaticism</span> (1762), as well as in a Drury Lane play. Toft's account continued to spark interest, most notably in Alexander Pope's poem, the <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> (1728), which revolves around a woman who proliferated monsters, and in the Daniel Turner&#150;James Blondel controversy over the power of the maternal imagination. The case against Toft was dropped, and she returned to Godalming. Charles, second duke of Richmond, occasionally showed Mary as a spectacle or curiosity at his residence in Godalming. She was reportedly charged with receiving stolen &#145;fowles&#146; in 1740. Toft died in Godalming, and was buried there on 13 January 1763.<br>
