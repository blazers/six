<span class="headword">Watson,  Joseph</span>  (1764/5&#150;1829), <span class="occ">teacher of deaf people</span>, was educated at a school in Mare Street, Hackney, run by his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3229/', "Thomas Braidwood")</script>, the pioneer teacher of deaf mute children. In 1784 he decided to follow his uncle's profession and was involved in the foundation in 1792, by public subscription, of the asylum for deaf and deaf mute children which opened in Grange Road, Bermondsey. He was principal of the new institution which, after further fund-raising, moved in 1809 to premises in Kent Road. His main object, shared by many of the asylum's promoters, who included the evangelicals Henry Cox Mason, Henry Thornton, and John Townsend, was religious instruction. The practical methods used by Braidwood were not publicized until after his death, when Watson published <span class="italic">Instruction of the deaf and dumb, or, A theoretical and practical view of the means by which they are taught to speak and understand a language</span> (2 vols., 1809). By then he held the degree of LLD but it was not specified from which university. He had a correspondence about the asylum with the French teacher the Abb&eacute; Sicard, who was interested in its work. While numbers of pupils in the asylum grew from 70 in 1810 to 200 in 1820, Watson took a decreasing part in the ordinary teaching, which he left to assistant teachers while he concentrated on his private pupils. Watson died at the deaf and dumb asylum, Kent Road, London, on 23 November 1829, and was buried at Bermondsey. One of his sons, Thomas James Watson (probably the individual of that name who matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1822), was director of the institution until 1857, when he was succeeded by his own son, Watson's grandson, James Harrison Watson (1827&#150;1888). <a name="cosubject_28827"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Watson</span>  (1815/16&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, a son of Joseph Watson, was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1837 and MA in 1840. After proceeding to Durham University, he passed as a licentiate in theology and was ordained as curate of St Andrew's, Ancoats, Manchester. In 1840 he took charge of St John's, Cheltenham, where he established schools. He published a number of devotional works of a high-Anglican type, including <span class="italic">The Devout Churchman, or, Daily Meditations</span> (2 vols., 1847). In 1851 he became vicar of St Mary Church-with-Coffinswell, Devon. He was married and had at least one son, born in 1853. On moving to the rectory of Bridestow and Sourton, near Oakhampton, Devon, in 1855, he borrowed money which led to the sequestration of the living and to his quitting it at the end of two years for the incumbency of Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury, London. He was involved in a chancery suit concerning the chapel, became insolvent, and was declared bankrupt on 11 January 1862, but was discharged on 21 February 1862. During 1863&#150;4 he assisted the ritualist clergyman John Charles Chambers at St Mary's, Soho, and in 1864 took charge of Middleton on the Wolds, near Beverley, Yorkshire. He died at Middleton on 1 February 1865.<br>
