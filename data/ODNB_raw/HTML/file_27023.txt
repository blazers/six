<span class="headword">Taylor,  Dan</span>  (1738&#150;1816), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister and founder of the New Connexion of General Baptists</span>, was born on 21 December 1738 at Sourmilk Hall, Northowram, Yorkshire, the elder son of Azor Taylor and his second wife, Mary Willey; his younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27053/', "John Taylor (1743&#150;1818)")</script>, Baptist minister. As Azor was a coalminer, he took his young son underground to work with him before his sixth birthday. Though he received no formal education, Dan Taylor took his books with him down the mine. He walked many miles to listen to the Wesleys and Whitefield and threw in his lot with the Methodists; at the age of twenty-three he preached his first sermon for them at Hipperholme. The local Methodists were so impressed with him that they wanted him to talk to John Wesley about being trained as one of Wesley's preachers. However, Taylor disagreed with certain aspects of Wesley's practices, so did not pursue that end. In fact, during the summer of 1762 he left the Methodists, becoming leader of a group of seceders from the Wadsworth Methodists.<br>
<br>Taylor's doubts about the validity of infant baptism led him to make a study of W. Wall's <span class="italic">History of Infant Baptism</span>, which convinced him of the Baptist case. He applied to several Particular Baptist ministers in the West Riding of Yorkshire for baptism, only to be refused because of his Arminian views. Taking John Slater with him he set out for Lincolnshire, where he believed there were Arminian Baptists. One night they found themselves surrounded completely by water, so they slept on a haystack. Next day they discovered that they had passed through Gamston, Nottinghamshire, where there was a General Baptist church. Retracing their steps they found the church and Taylor was baptized by the minister, Joseph Jeffery, in the River Idle, on 16 February 1763.<br>
<br>On his return to Wadsworth, Taylor baptized Slater and several others, who formed themselves into a Baptist church and joined the Lincolnshire association. That autumn Taylor was ordained by Gilbert Boyce of Coningsby. Soon the meeting-house where they met became too small. A new chapel was built at Birchcliffe, where Taylor ministered for the next nine years. He travelled extensively beyond the association and came into contact with the Leicestershire churches which had been formed as a result of an evangelical revival. He noticed that throughout the country churches were at a very low ebb, morally and theologically, and many had dwindled numerically. &#145;They degraded Jesus Christ, and he degraded them&#146;  (A. C. Underwood, 152), he wrote. To remedy this situation, he proposed a union of the Leicestershire churches with those General Baptist churches elsewhere that remained evangelical in a New Connexion. The New Connexion held its first assembly in Church Lane, Whitechapel, from 6 to 8 June 1770. It was led by Taylor, who was usually in the chair; he presided over its academy from 1798 to 1813 and edited the first issues of the <span class="italic">General Baptist Magazine</span> from 1798 to 1800. He did not formally leave the old general assembly, where he represented the Leicestershire association, until 1802. The New Connexion continued until in 1891 it joined the Baptist Union.<br>
<br>In 1782 a church was formed in Halifax to which Taylor was invited as pastor. The association hit on an experiment: for one of the Birchcliffe members to fill the pulpit for six months, while Taylor ministered at Halifax. He settled as pastor of Halifax in October 1783. Two years later, when he was invited to become the colleague of the venerable John Brittain at Church Lane, Whitechapel, the association voted for him to go to London, where he could do more &#145;to the glory of God&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">New Connection</span>, 2.207) than if he remained in Yorkshire. He assisted Brittain for some nine years before taking sole charge in 1794. Brittain seldom preached after Taylor's arrival. They disagreed over the practice of laying hands on the newly baptized as a prerequisite of participation in the Lord's supper, although Taylor raised no objection provided that he did not perform the ceremony; after Brittains's death the church left the matter to individual choice. Taylor had long deplored the poor education of the ministry. When the denomination decided to start an academy, it was Taylor whom they appointed as its tutor at Mile End in 1798. There he remained until 1813, when the academy moved to Wisbech.<br>
<br>Taylor was a phenomenally robust leader of the New Connexion: he travelled 25,000 miles, preached nearly 20,000 sermons, and wrote more than 50 books and pamphlets. He stridently opposed Arian, unitarian, and universalist views, and debated theological differences with Andrew Fuller, a leading Particular Baptist, while retaining his friendship.<br>
<br>Taylor was four times married. His first wife, Elizabeth Saltonstall, whom he married on 10 November 1764 at Heptonstall, Yorkshire, died on 22 October 1793; on 12 August 1794 he married Elizabeth Newton, who died on 14 October 1809. His third wife was Mary Toplis, a widow whom he married on 24 March 1811 and who died on 18 December 1812. About a month before his death he married, on 21 October 1816 at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, Mrs Sarah Saunders. He retained his powers of body and mind until he was seventy. Thereafter, he grew gradually weaker, until on 26 November 1816 he collapsed and died in London. He was buried in Bunhill Fields.<br>
