<span class="headword">Cynesige</span> <span class="st"> [St Cynesige, Kynsige]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1060), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, seems to have come from the eastern Danelaw, perhaps from Rutland where he inherited the manor of Tinwell. He is said to have been born by caesarean section, but the story was probably invented to supply a miraculous start to the life of a man who was later honoured as a saint at Peterborough. John of Worcester and Symeon of Durham describe him as a royal clerk at the time of his appointment to York, but Peterborough tradition maintained that he had been a monk of that house. If he was a royal priest he may have been the Cynesige <i>presbyter</i> who witnessed three Abingdon charters of 1050, but it seems unlikely that he was the Cynesige <i>presbyter</i> who witnessed a Devon charter of 1026. Whatever his background, his promotion to York in 1051 implies that he was at least acceptable to the faction opposed to Earl Godwine, and that may account for the fact that although his pontificate coincided with the first part of that of the simoniacal Stigand at Canterbury, Cynesige apparently did not play as large a part in the political life of the country as did his successor Ealdred. In 1059, however, he and Earl Tostig and Bishop &AElig;thelwine of Durham, the chief men of Northumbria, conducted Malcolm of Scotland to his meeting with Edward the Confessor. Cynesige was presumably present at that meeting, and at others at which he witnessed four of the five known royal charters from the period of his archiepiscopate.<br>
<br>In 1056 Cynesige presided over a council in London at which he consecrated Herewald bishop of Llandaff in the presence of Edward the Confessor. In May 1060 he apparently consecrated Earl Harold's minister at Waltham, Essex. He is also said to have consecrated two bishops of Glasgow, Magsue and John, but it is doubtful whether they ever resided in that diocese. They were probably titular bishops of Glasgow, working as suffragans in the York diocese.<br>
<br>In his own diocese Cynesige continued the work of his predecessor &AElig;lfric at the houses of secular canons (there were no monasteries in the diocese). At Beverley he carried on the work on the dormitory and refectory, and built a stone tower, probably at the west end of the church. He gave bells to Beverley, and to Stow, Lincolnshire, and Southwell, Nottinghamshire, and he also gave books and ornaments to Beverley. Peterborough tradition recorded that, unlike his household, he lived an ascetic life, eating simple food and travelling on foot to preach in the towns and villages of his diocese in Lent.<br>
<br>Cynesige died on 22 December 1060 at York, and was buried, in accordance with his wishes, at Peterborough Abbey, to which he gave with his body the estate at Tinwell and &pound;300 worth of ornaments, which were later taken by the Confessor's queen, Edith. The abbey seems to have attempted to promote a cult of Cynesige, who was called by its twelfth-century chronicler <i>sanctus</i>. Cynesige was certainly not a martyr, so there must have been some aspect of his character, probably an element of asceticism, which encouraged the attempt at canonization. If he was unable to enforce similar standards on his household, he may have lacked authority. Later in the middle ages, Cynesige's bones, like those of his predecessor &AElig;lfric, were placed in a chest and built into the north wall of the chancel, near the high altar of the abbey church. They were rediscovered when the altar was destroyed in 1643.<br>
