<span class="headword">Coppinger,  Richard William</span>  (1847&#150;1910), <span class="occ">naval surgeon and naturalist</span>, born on 11 October 1847 in Dublin, was the youngest of the six sons of Joseph William Coppinger, a solicitor of Farmley, Dundrum, co. Dublin, and his wife, Agnes Mary, only daughter of William Lalor Cooke, a landed proprietor of Fortwilliam, co. Tipperary. The father's family was long settled at Ballyvolane and Barryscourt, co. Cork, and was said to descend from the first Danish settlers in Cork city. Coppinger received his medical education in Dublin, graduating MD at the Queen's University in 1870. Entering the medical department of the navy, he was appointed surgeon to HMS <i>Discovery</i>, which left Portsmouth on 29 May 1875 under the command of Captain George S. Nares on a voyage of exploration towards the north pole. The <i>Discovery</i> reached a higher latitude than had ever been touched before, and Coppinger distinguished himself as the naturalist in charge of one of the sledging parties. On the return of the <i>Discovery</i> to England in October 1876 he was specially promoted staff-surgeon and awarded the Arctic medal. Coppinger served as naturalist in the HMS <i>Alert</i> on her four years' exploring cruise in Patagonian, Polynesian, and Mascarene waters from 1878 to 1882. He married, on 8 January 1884, Matilda Mary, daughter of Thomas Harvey Browne, a landed proprietor of Sydney, New South Wales. They had three sons and one daughter; she survived her husband.<br>
<br>In 1889 Coppinger was appointed instructor in hygiene at the Haslar Royal Naval Hospital at Gosport, where he was a most successful teacher, his knowledge of bacteriology being in advance of the time. On 13 March 1901 he was appointed inspector-general of hospitals and fleets, and was for three years in charge at Haslar. On 15 May 1904 he was placed on half pay, and, disappointed at not being made director-general of the medical department of the navy, he retired in 1906.<br>
<br>Coppinger wrote <span class="italic">The Cruise of the Alert, 1878&#150;82</span> (1883); &#145;Some experiments on the conductive properties of ice made in Discovery Bay, 1875&#150;6&#146;  (<span class="italic">PRS</span> 27, 1878, 183&#150;9); and &#145;Account of the zoological collections made in the years 1878&#150;1881, during the survey of HMS <i>Alert</i> in the Straits of Magellan and the coast of Patagonia&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span>, 1881). He also contributed to the parliamentary paper containing the report of the Admiralty committee (1877) on &#145;The outbreak of scurvy in the Arctic expedition, 1875&#150;6&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1877, 56, 557), and to the <span class="italic">Report on the zoological collections made in the Indo-Pacific Ocean during the voyage of HMS Alert 1881&#150;2</span>  (British Museum, Nat. Hist., 1884). He died at his residence, Wallington House, Fareham, on 2 April 1910, and was buried at Fareham cemetery.<br>
