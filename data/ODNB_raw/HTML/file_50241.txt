<span class="headword">Tuddenham, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1401&#150;1462), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born at Eriswell, Suffolk, the younger son of Sir Robert Tuddenham of Eriswell (1366&#150;1405) and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Harling, esquire. Thomas inherited the Tuddenham estates on the death of his elder brother, Robert, in 1415. His wardship and marriage were granted to Sir John Rodenhale and John Wodehous, esquire, in July 1417. It was probably in the following year that Tuddenham married Wodehous's daughter Alice. The couple lived together until about 1425, and during that time Alice gave birth to a short-lived son. The marriage did not last; both later stated that it had never been consummated, and Alice acknowledged that her child had been the result of a liaison with her father's chamberlain. They separated formally by 1429, when Alice entered the Augustinian nunnery of Crabhouse, Norfolk. She seems still to have been living there in 1475. Although the marriage was annulled in 1436, Tuddenham never remarried.<br>
<br>Tuddenham received livery of his estates in March 1423. His association with his father-in-law, Wodehous (which does not seem to have been compromised by the failure of his marriage), involved him with a powerful political network in Norfolk which had developed since 1399 around those local men who were associated with the management of the king's duchy of Lancaster estates in the north of the shire. Wodehous had held the duchy of Lancaster stewardship in East Anglia since 1415, but on 30 June 1425 he surrendered the office so that it could be granted for life to Tuddenham, who seems also to have been knighted about this time. It was probably through Wodehous's influence that Tuddenham became a member of the household of Thomas Beaufort, duke of Exeter, the most powerful nobleman in Norfolk until his death in 1426. Tuddenham's involvement in Norfolk politics was reinforced in 1434 when he inherited the manor of Oxburgh, which was to become his principal residence, from a distant cousin.<br>
<br>By the later 1430s William de la Pole, earl (later duke) of Suffolk (1396&#150;1450), succeeded in establishing himself as Exeter's successor at the head of the Norfolk network of which Tuddenham was a part. Suffolk was also by this time in the ascendant at court. Tuddenham's position as one of Suffolk's most influential supporters was reflected in his many appointments and grants in East Anglia and in the king's household. Tuddenham was appointed sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in 1432; he was MP for Suffolk in 1431, and for Norfolk in 1432, 1435, and 1442. He was named to every peace commission in Norfolk between 1434 and 1450. On 29 September 1443 he was appointed chief steward of the north parts of the duchy of Lancaster jointly with Suffolk, and on 26 October 1446, as a king's knight, he was made keeper of the great wardrobe.<br>
<br>The degree of influence wielded in East Anglia by Tuddenham and associates such as John Heydon of Baconsthorpe during the 1440s is usually described as the temporary hijacking of regional power structures by Suffolk's henchmen, a view reinforced by the hostility with which they were portrayed in the Paston letters, but the local influence of Tuddenham's broad circle had much deeper roots than their identification as a court clique allows. Their regional dominance both predated Suffolk's rise to power, and survived his fall in 1450. In that year and the next Tuddenham lost his position on the Norfolk peace commission, his keepership of the great wardrobe, and his stewardship of the north parts of the duchy, and charges were brought against Tuddenham and Heydon by their local opponents, prominent among whom were the Pastons. However, the influence of Tuddenham and his associates was quickly reasserted under the leadership of the dowager duchess of Suffolk and Thomas, Lord Scales. By 1452 Tuddenham and Heydon were again being appointed to special commissions, and in 1455 both were reinstated as JPs in Norfolk.<br>
<br>The connections between Tuddenham's circle and the court meant that during the 1450s they aligned themselves with Queen Margaret against Richard, duke of York. Under the financial resettlement initiated by the queen at the end of 1458 Tuddenham became treasurer of the royal household. After the Yorkist victory in 1461 a commission for Tuddenham's arrest was issued, and he was executed on 23 February 1462 as a rebel and traitor. His lands passed to his sister Margaret, wife of Sir Edmund Bedingfield. Tuddenham was buried in the church of the Austin Friars in London.<br>
