<span class="headword">Frowde,  James Henry</span>  (1831&#150;1899), <span class="occ">clown and evangelical preacher</span>, was born on 17 April 1831 at Portsea, Hampshire, the first son of James Frowde (1800&#150;1850) and his first wife, Georgiana Margaretta Hengler (1808&#150;1837), an equestrian performer, the daughter of the circus rope-dancer Henry Michael Hengler. His mother's early death, leaving four young children, made a vivid and lasting impression on Frowde; his father remarried within the year. He received a liberal education, while his home life was strictly religious and puritanical, under the influence of his stepmother.<br>
<br>Frowde's life was changed by the visit of Hengler's circus to Portsmouth in 1846. For the first time he met his mother's family, and in the summer of 1847 he joined Charles Hengler's circus at Stamford. He learned to ride, and earned his keep by cleaning out the stables and animals' quarters. He first appeared in the circus at Leicester in that year, as a supernumerary in a f&ecirc;te scene. One of the clowns taught Frowde all he knew, and by 1850 &#145;Jem Frowde&#146; appeared on the bills as &#145;a Man of Many Forms&#146;&#151;referring to his skills as a contortionist. He became one of the main attractions at Hengler's, and enjoyed immense popularity. He travelled with the company for the next ten years, and briefly ran his own company in 1859. He was principal clown at Charles Hengler's new circus which opened in Liverpool in 1857, where it was later recalled that, &#145;Being a good-looking young fellow, Jem had a host of female admirers and used to be daily inundated with love letters and souvenirs d'amour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Citizen</span>, 12 Sept 1888, 12c). His dress imitated the original court jester style as closely as possible, with cap and bells, and no make-up apart from a little rouge.<br>
<br>The impact of his religious upbringing remained with Frowde, and in December 1856 at Chester he was presented with a valuable <span class="roman">Bible</span> by three clergymen, as a testimonial to his conduct in private life and his constant attendance at church services. On 4 June 1857 he married Elizabeth, the youngest daughter of the Revd Christopher Hayden, at St John's Church, Liverpool. She died in childbirth the following March. The child, a daughter, also died. Frowde continued to perform as a clown until 1861, mainly with Hengler's but occasionally appearing with other companies. On 9 October 1861 he married Susan Mary, the daughter of the Revd William Harrison, at Leamington Spa, and retired from the circus.<br>
<br>Frowde exchanged the circus for the life of a country gentleman, purchased three estates near Newent, Gloucestershire, and became a freemason. From 1878 until 1892 he was a captain in the Gloucestershire artillery volunteers. With his second wife he had two sons and two daughters. He continued to live a religious life. His &#145;talking clown&#146; experience and colloquial skills, in addition to his intimate knowledge of the scriptures, equipped him for the role of lay preacher, and he had a mission room erected at one of his properties, Walden Court, and obtained a bishop's licence to preach there. The contrast between his natural jollity and grave religious beliefs led many people to regard him as eccentric, if not actually shocking, but his character overcame the reservations of the local people.<br>
<br>About 1892 the Frowdes relinquished their estates and went to live in Gloucester. Following the death of his wife in 1895, James Frowde took rooms at 53 Westgate Street, where he died on 28 August 1899. He was buried in Gloucester cemetery.<br>
