<span class="headword">Finleyson <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Finlayson]</span>,  John</span>  (1770&#150;1854), <span class="occ">disciple of Richard Brothers</span>, was born in Scotland. According to his children he was the second son of Colonel John Hamilton M'Finlay, who about 1765 married Lady Elizabeth Mary Alexander, eldest sister of the fifth and last earl of Stirling. The son was originally a lawyer at Cupar, Fife, and moved from there to Edinburgh. He became convinced of the extravagant claims of the former naval lieutenant Richard Brothers, the &#145;Revealed Prince of the Hebrews&#146;, to be about to restore the Jews to Jerusalem under his own rule. Finlayson printed at Edinburgh a pamphlet in support of Brothers and another on the restoration of the Jews before selling his legal practice for &pound;25,000 and moving to London early in 1798.<br>
<br>In London Finlayson had a &#145;considerable practice as a house-agent&#146; and attempted to secure the release of Brothers from a lunatic asylum, which he eventually achieved in 1806. He was responsible for seeing Brothers's works into print during his incarceration; he also drew up and had printed nine large sheets of the ground plan of the New Jerusalem (including its 56 squares, 320 streets, 4 temples, 20 colleges, 47 private palaces, and 16 markets) and twelve sheets of views of its public buildings. In 1808 he married Elizabeth Anne, the daughter of Colonel Basil Bruce, who until his death in 1801 had been (with his father, Stanhope Bruce, vicar of Inglesham) an important follower of Brothers. Brothers persuaded Finlayson to change the spelling of his name by telling him that his ancestors had some &#145;fine leys&#146; of land granted to them for deeds of valour. Unlike his wife's family, who abandoned Brothers and became followers of Joanna Southcott, Finleyson remained faithful to his master. When, in 1824, Brothers died in Finleyson's house in Upper Baker Street, Marylebone, he made it his dying charge to his friend that he should write against a former disciple, Bartholomew Prescot of Liverpool. This Finleyson did, describing Prescot's <span class="italic">System of the Universe</span> as a &#145;misapprehended mistaken elaborate performance, or book&#146;.<br>
<br>Finleyson printed a variety of pamphlets reiterating Brothers's views and developing his own peculiar notions of astronomy, for which he claimed a divine origin. The heavenly bodies were created, he thought, partly &#145;to amuse us in observing them&#146;. The earth he considered to be a perfect sphere, &#145;not shaped like a garden turnip as the Newtonians make it&#146;; the sun was a created body, &#145;very different from anything we can make here below&#146;, while the stars were &#145;oval-shaped immense masses of frozen water, with their largest ends foremost&#146;.<br>
<br>Finleyson was reduced in extreme age to a parish allowance of 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. weekly, supplemented by 5<i>s</i>. from a Mr Busby in whose house Brothers had lived from 1806 to 1815. However, John Mason (a brushmaker), who remained a faithful disciple after the death of Brothers, refused to assist him, but Finleyson persevered in his loyalty to Brothers, publishing several further pamphlets on prophetic subjects, including <span class="italic">God's Creation of the Universe</span> (1848) and <span class="italic">The Last Trumpet</span> (1849). To Mason's annoyance he even made claims on Brothers's estate. Finleyson's pamphlets are scarce: he deposited his stock with Mason, after whose death it was destroyed.<br>
<br>Finleyson's wife died in 1848, six years before his own death on 19 September 1854. He was buried in the same grave as Brothers at St John's Wood. Of his ten children the eldest son, Richard Brothers Finlayson, who took the name Richard Beauford, was a photographer at Galway and died there in 1886.<br>
