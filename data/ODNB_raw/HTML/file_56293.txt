<span class="headword">King,  Bryan</span>  (1811&#150;1895), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Liverpool on 28 December 1811, the second son of George King, merchant, and his wife, Catherine. He was educated at Shrewsbury School from 1826 to 1831. In 1831 he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, taking a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1834, becoming a fellow of the college, and holding a Hulme exhibition. At Oxford his theological views changed from evangelicalism to Tractarianism. He was deaconed in 1836 and priested in 1837.<br>
<br>King was perpetual curate of St John's, Bethnal Green, from 1837 to 1842, a Brasenose College living, and played a leading role in the building of new churches in the area. On 28 September 1842 he married Mary Martha Fardell (<i>d</i>. 1895), second daughter of Thomas Fardell, rector of Boothby Pagnell. In the same year he was appointed rector to another Brasenose living in the East End, St George-in-the-East. His determination to introduce high-church liturgical practices prompted fierce and sustained opposition from his parishioners and from the dissenters who composed the parish vestry. Matters came to a head in May 1859 when the parishioners elected the Revd Hugh Allen, a virulent anti-Tractarian clergyman, to a lectureship at St George's, provoking a cycle of rioting at the church and half-hearted action by the police which lasted for eighteen months. King's health broke down, and in 1860 he took his family abroad to Bruges for three years. In his absence the parish was run by a succession of clergy who managed to reimpose some order. In 1863 Bishop Tait of London secured an exchange of livings for King, and he became vicar of Avebury in Wiltshire, staying until 1894 and enjoying a quiet semi-retirement.<br>
<br>King's historical significance rests largely on the events surrounding the riots at St George-in-the-East. In the 1840s and 1850s he was regarded as an important Tractarian parish clergyman, being active in the formation of the Society of the Holy Cross, an association for Anglo-Catholic clergy, in 1855. But his energy was sapped by long years in a struggling East End ministry, and then broken by his experience at St George's.<br>
<br>King was described as a handsome man, stubborn and reserved, but sociable and possessing a strong sense of humour. He died on 30 January 1895 in Weston-super-Mare, where he and his wife had settled some months after his retirement. His wife died in October 1895. He was buried on 2 February 1895 at All Saints' Church, Weston-super-Mare.<br>
