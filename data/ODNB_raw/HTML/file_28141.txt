<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Robert Powell</span>  (1591/2&#150;1667), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the only son of Hywel Fychan ap Gruffydd ap Hywel (<i>d</i>. 1639) of Gwengraig, near Dolgellau, and his wife, Margaret, second daughter of Edward Owen of Hengwrt, Merioneth, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21020/', "Lewis Owen (d. 1555)")</script>, baron of the exchequer of north Wales. On 4 December 1612 he matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, at the age of twenty, but he left without taking a degree. He married Catherine (1594&#150;1663), daughter of Griffith Nanney, with whom he had four sons and four daughters: Howell Vaughan of Vanner, later sheriff of Merioneth, Ynyr, Hugh, Griffith, Margaret, Jane, Elin, and Ann. His father had acquired Hengwrt from Catherine's brother-in-law by a mortgage but Hywel never lived there himself. Robert was still living at Gwengraig in 1624 and possibly moved to Hengwrt on his marriage, although the date of this is not known. He was on the commission of the peace for Merioneth.<br>
<br>Vaughan's only real publication was <span class="italic">British Antiquities Revived</span> (1662) which was largely concerned with the debate over which of the sons of Rhodri Mawr (<i>d</i>. 878) was the eldest; a debate to which the most notable other contribution was that of George Owen's &#145;An aunswer to north-Wales men that would maintayne Anarawd to be the eldest of his brethern and the superior prince of Wales&#146;. It also included a correction of the pedigree of the earl of Carbery that had appeared in Percy Enderbie's <span class="italic">Cambria triumphans</span> (1661), making the distinction between Gwaethfoed of Powys and Gwaethfoed of Ceredigion, as well as a short tract on the five royal tribes of Wales. For Vaughan a history ought &#145;to testifie the truth by consent of the tymes, and immediate succession of princes, otherwise will appeare like a broken chaine, wantinge some necessarie linkes to unite the whole&#146; and he thus produced <span class="italic">British Antiquities</span> &#145;cheefeley out of a desire to cleere the way for a perfect historie of Wales, yf any shall undertake it&#146;.<br>
<br>Vaughan's other historical labours were also matters of translation and supplementation rather than original writing. He translated <span class="italic">Brut y Twysogion</span> for James Ussher. In 1663 he also commenced printing an expanded version of David Powel's <span class="italic">Historie of Cambria</span> before discovering that his material had been used without permission in Enderby's <span class="italic">Cambria triumphans</span>. Only 128 pages had been printed at that stage and all but a few copies were sold for waste paper. He is also thought to have had a large hand in the writing of Thomas Ellis's <span class="italic">Memoirs of Owen Glendowr</span>. Other works by Vaughan include <span class="italic">Trioedd ynys Prydain</span>, a scripture concordance, and a collection of Welsh proverbs with translations. He had John Meredith enquire the cost of publishing the latter two in London in 1655.<br>
<br>Vaughan died on Ascension day (16 May) 1667. In his will he asked to be buried at Dolgellau. He left what has been regarded as the &#145;premier collection&#146; of Welsh manuscripts, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. It included the oldest manuscripts of the laws of Wales, of Arthurian and other romances, and of the holy grail, together with an early translation of part of <span class="roman">Matthew's gospel</span>, historical and medieval theological works, and a very substantial amount of poetry. Disputes over the manuscripts went to law and in 1697 Edward Lhuyd described the library as &#145;much rifld&#146;  (R. T. Gunther, <span class="italic">Early Science in Oxford</span>, 14, 1945, 348), but the collection remained largely intact, and incorporated into the Peniarth collection donated by Sir John Williams it formed a cornerstone of the National Library of Wales's collection when it was established at Aberystwyth. Vaughan's collection of books fared less well, being finally dispersed in the early nineteenth century, but various catalogues of both manuscripts and books are extant  (Tibbott, Davies, and Jones). &#145;Robert Vaughan and his library&#146; was set by the council of the national eisteddfod as a topic for a major essay in the late 1940s.<br>
