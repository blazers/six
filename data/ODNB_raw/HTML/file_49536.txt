</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Soutar,  William</span>  (1898&#150;1943), <span class="occ">poet and diarist</span>, was born on 28 April 1898 at 2 South Inch Terrace, Perth, the only child of John Soutar (1871&#150;1958), master joiner, and his wife, Margaret Smith (1870&#150;1954), who were both Scottish. Soutar's mother wrote poetry, and her athletic, handsome son followed suit, regularly composing verses while still a schoolboy. He attended the Southern District School, Perth, from 1903 to 1912 and Perth Academy from 1912 to 1916.<br>
<br>Soutar joined the Royal Navy in 1916, and spent the next two years with the North Atlantic Fleet. The life was taxing, but it was a stimulating challenge. He enjoyed the rough comradeship of fellow sailors but became increasingly aware of the politics of war and the human suffering that it caused. The experience developed his democratic instincts and his doubts about the values of empire, conquest, and class-ridden society. He was demobilized in November 1918, but at that time of rejoicing was ill and unable to walk, due to an unidentifiable ailment. In 1919 he had recovered sufficiently to begin a course in medicine, which he did not enjoy, before switching to honours English at Edinburgh University, but he never regained full mobility.<br>
<br>Soutar's university career was undistinguished. Anglo-Saxon bored him, and he challenged the university establishment and distinguished Donne scholar Herbert Grierson, his professor, asserting its irrelevance to his future career. He dressed in a dandified fashion, alienating his peers, many of whom were prejudiced against former forces students. He graduated in 1923 with a third-class degree, which he was lucky to get, having been perversely arrogant throughout, refusing for example to study the novel. &#145;I'm not a &#147;Varsity bird&#148;&#151;one is apt to get cobwebs on one's wings&#146;, he commented on the years when he:<blockquote>
<div>walked with stiffening bones<br>
</div>
<div>among the academic stones.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Continuing, however, to write English poetry, he contributed to the magazine <span class="italic">The Student</span>. His first book, <span class="italic">Gleanings by an Undergraduate</span> (1923), was produced, like most of his subsequent slim volumes, at his father's expense. On 18 April 1919 he also began his lifelong practice of keeping a daily dairy: &#145;Carpe Diem!&#146; heralded that commitment, followed the next day with &#145;Remember to seize every opportunity. Reverence Truth: Chastity and Love&#146;. A belief that his thoughts might have wider relevance and significance is already implicit in those words.<br>
<br>During this period Soutar made contact with Hugh MacDiarmid (C. M. Grieve), at that time a journalist in Montrose, and Ezra Pound, among others. His letters indicate determined ambitions as a poet and contempt for the fashionable poetry of the day. MacDiarmid was abandoning writing poetry in English in favour of &#145;synthetic Scots&#146;, eclectically gleaned from old Scots, especially the medieval &#145;makars&#146; Henrysoun and Dunbar, and all current dialects. This evolved into the Scottish literary renaissance, its aim to revitalize Scottish culture by replacing dominant stereotypes, mostly distorted caricatures, with genuine images and concepts rooted in, but not bound by, genuine Scottish traditions and connecting with the European modernist mainstream. Soutar initially disagreed with the linguistic spearhead of MacDiarmid's agenda but became increasingly excited by the possibilities of Scots. He had an effortless grasp of the language, having grown up in a Scots-speaking environment. By 1930 he was fervently writing Scots poetry for adults as well as his superb &#145;bairnrhymes&#146; for children, believing that &#145;if the Doric is to come back alive, it will come on a cock-horse&#146;  (letter to C. M. Grieve, 1931).<br>
<br>Unfortunately for Soutar his mysterious illness advanced during his university career; his hopes of becoming a journalist with <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> were dashed. He began teacher training in October 1924 but had to return to Perth to undergo medical treatment for his now diagnosed ankylosing spondylitis. His parents were happy to keep him, but from 1924 he became increasingly stiff and paralysed, and in 1930 finally bedridden. One bright spot in this darkening picture was his parents' adoption of an orphaned Australian cousin, Evelyn, aged six. Soutar doted on her, and she inspired his bairnrhymes.<br>
<br>From 26 November 1930, and the onset of permanent invalidity, to his death, thirteen years later, Soutar's life entailed predictable routine. Lovingly looked after, with his bedroom and bed always immaculate, he was a dandy to the last, dressing with care and bravado in velvet jacket and bow tie, his black hair fanned out on the supporting pillows. Nature had always been his great passion, and the window of his long room was enlarged so that he could observe the outside world: the garden, the sycamore tree at its foot, and Craigie Hill beyond, wrenchingly nostalgic for memories of his previous active life, the hill being a natural haven for courting couples. Eventually Soutar couldn't move even his head; his father furnished the room with bookshelves and an elaborate system of mirrors so that he could identify to a mobile helper the books that he required.<br>
<br>October 1924 had witnessed a poignant moment when Soutar, walking one lovely evening in Edinburgh and contemplating the prospect of his future, restricted life, stopped under the pillars of St George's West Church and said to himself: &#145;Now, I can be a poet&#146;. Throughout his bedridden years he set himself a strict daily routine of writing poetry, adding to his diary, and making many other jottings: commonplace books for noting (often humorously) trivial events; journals for more extensive, philosophical explorations; dream books; and letters. He read voraciously, believing that &#145;the poet should know everything&#146;, at one point setting himself to read the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>&#151;a task that he accomplished.<br>
<br>The invalid's room became a magnet for visitors: family, friends, local worthies, well-intending sick-visitors. Soutar was always cheery and welcoming to his uninvited guests but secretly was irritated and frustrated when hours each week were inevitably passed in &#145;mindless conversation&#146;. He was also sexually frustrated and often fantasized about women who might somehow provide relief. His parents' strict religious views rendered any such satisfaction out of the question. One of his finest poems, &#145;The Tryst&#146;, takes the form of a haunting fantasy about receiving a nubile, willing night visitor. Many literary figures also called: Hugh MacDiarmid, George Bruce, Tom Scott, William Montgomery, Helen B. Cruickshank, the artist and school friend Jim Finlayson, and others. With them he could relish real conversation.<br>
<br>Though brought up in the Free Church of Scotland (Auld Lichters) Soutar departed from the strict beliefs of his parents and became virtually an atheist. He became more nationalistic and socialist, and his own predicament combined with his outgoing nature and love of life to generate in him a passionate pacifism. The Spanish Civil War horrified him, especially the bombing of Guernica, inspiration for his outstanding poem &#145;The Children&#146;. As the Second World War proceeded he was increasingly weakened by tuberculosis, first contracted in 1929. His decline in energy and well-being from 1942 onwards is noticeable in all his writings, and he knew by July 1943 that his condition was terminal. It was then that he began a special diary, <span class="italic">The Diary of a Dying Man</span>, to document that last journey. It is a masterpiece.<br>
<br>William Soutar died on 15 October 1943 at his home&#151;27 Wilson Street, Perth&#151;and was buried at Jeanfield cemetery, Perth. There is a tendency still for the Scottish literary orthodoxy to dismiss him as a poetic miniaturist whose best achievement was a few Scots poems and the bairnrhymes, and as an old-fashioned figure in the male-dominated literary renaissance. His poetic achievement, however, extends to many fine poems in English, and even a large proportion of his Scots writing still goes ignored. After Soutar's death Hugh MacDiarmid edited his <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1948) but, perhaps because he felt Soutar essentially a rival and threat, he left out many fine pieces. W. R. Aitken edited <span class="italic">Poems in Scots and English</span> in 1961, but not until 1988 was there a substantial edition, <span class="italic">Poems of William Soutar: a New Selection</span>, also edited by Aitken, who decided, misguidedly, that Soutar would not be best served by a proper edition of the complete poems. Soutar's diaries must also be considered in any assessment. In 1954 Alexander Scott published a small selection from the diaries of 1930 to 1943, unfortunately entitling it <span class="italic">Diaries of a Dying Man</span>, virtually appropriating the title of that unique, last diary. It was thanks to American diarist scholar Thomas Mallon, moved by the tragic story of the diaries and amazed at their literary quality and Soutar's obscurity, that a process began that brought <span class="italic">Diaries of a Dying Man</span> back into print in 1988.<br>
<br>A biographical television film, <span class="italic">The Garden Beyond</span>, was broadcast in 1977 but a real awakening of interest in Soutar did not occur until the late 1980s, with an article in the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. A selection from <span class="italic">Diaries of a Dying Man</span> was broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland in 1987, and in 1989 Soutar House, bequeathed by Soutar's father to the town as a memorial to his son, was refurbished, designated a listed building, and a writer in residence installed. In 1990 Perth Theatre produced a play about Soutar's life, <span class="italic">Gang doun wi' a Sang</span>. But the fact that in his centenary year, 1998, none of his poems was in print shows that the unique achievement of his contribution is not yet properly appreciated, in Scotland or internationally.<br>
<br>Soutar as a literary figure must be examined in his entirety: the poetry in Scots and English, the diaries, the letters, and other writings, mostly still unpublished. His literary output must be seen against the background of his life story and the suffering that he endured, his courage, and the sheer sensitive intelligence that he brought to everything. At its best the poetry exhibits a perfection and lyrical resonance that few poets achieve, while the intellectual power and insight represented by the diaries is of international significance. Seen in this context Soutar is a major figure in Scottish literature.<br>
