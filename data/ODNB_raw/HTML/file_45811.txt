<span class="headword">Carey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jackson]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Carey  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1609, <em>d.</em> in or after 1680), <span class="occ">author of verse and autobiographical meditations</span>, was the daughter and heir of Sir John Jackson of Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland; she wrote of her family that &#145;I had tenderly loving parents&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 1308, fols. 15&#150;44). In her autobiographical meditations, dated between 11 February 1650 and 12 January 1658, she described her conversion to a life of piety at the age of about eighteen after a near fatal illness. She married first, at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 24 June 1630, Pelham Carey (<i>c</i>.1612&#150;1642/3), a younger son of Henry Carey, first earl of Dover (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1666), and his first wife, Judith Pelham (<i>bap</i>. 1590, <i>d</i>. 1629); her husband was knighted in Scotland on 16 July 1633. He was living in Berwick in September 1642, but died within the next few months, apparently leaving no surviving children. On 8 June 1643, still in Berwick, Mary Carey married George Payler (<i>d</i>. in or before 1678), paymaster of the garrison there from 1639 to 1642, but by this time one of the officers of the ordnance and armoury in the Tower of London. Although deeply attached to her second husband Mary kept the surname of her first, presumably because of Sir Pelham's titled status.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Lady Carey accompanied Payler on military campaigns. Later they divided their time between the north-east and the London area, as Payler retained interests in Berwick. Admitted to Gray's Inn on 23 March 1652 he continued as surveyor of the ordnance and in 1654 was additionally appointed a navy commissioner. He was MP for Berwick in 1659. His wife wrote during that decade, &#145;I have liv'd in Barwick, London, Kent, Hunsdon, Edenborough, Thistleworth, Hackney, Tottridge, Greenwich, Bednall Green, Clapham, Yorke, [Nun] Monkton, St James's, Newington, Covent Garden, &amp; deare St Katherine's&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 1308, fol. 195).<br>
<br>Of the couple's seven children the first five died in infancy, including Robert (<i>d</i>. 1650) and Peregrine (<i>d</i>. 1652); only Bethia (1652/3&#150;1671) and Nathaniel (1654/5&#150;1680?) survived to adulthood. In addition to live births Lady Carey suffered at least one miscarriage, an experience which provided the inspiration for her most famous poem, &#145;Upon the Sight of my Abortive Birth the 31th of December 1657&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 1308, fols. 215&#150;22). The poem compares the &#145;little Embrio; voyd of life, and feature&#146; to the &#145;dead frute&#146;, in the form of lifeless religious devotions, which Lady Carey is reproached for offering to God: &#145;Dead dutys; prayers; praises thou dost bring, affections dead; dead hart in every thinge &hellip; Mend now my Child, &amp; lively frute bring me; so thou advantag'd much by this wilt be&#146;  (Greer, 159&#150;60). She also composed other pious meditations in verse and prose, including &#145;A Dialogue betwixt the Soule, and the Body&#146;, dedicated to her husband (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 1308, fols. 1&#150;176).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Lady Carey and her husband seem to have retired to his property at Nun Monkton in Yorkshire. Bethia married James Darcy of Sedbury in the same county, but died on 19 November 1671 aged only eighteen. Payler died in or before 1678, when his widow received the first of several grants of administration of his estates. Their son also predeceased his mother: Nathaniel was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1670, and to Gray's Inn in 1671, and had a son Nathaniel (<i>d</i>. 1748), but had died by 3 December 1680, when Lady Carey was granted probate of his will. The date of her death is unknown.<br>
