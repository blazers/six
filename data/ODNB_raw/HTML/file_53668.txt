<span class="headword">Cooper,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">bookseller and writer on the occult sciences</span>, was born in Leicester, the son of John Cooper and his wife, Elizabeth. He was baptized on 5 June 1639 at the parish church of St Martin in Leicester. Following his father's death, Cooper moved to London and, on 29 September 1655, began an eight-year apprenticeship to William Wells, stationer, under whom he developed the occupational interests and skills that would serve him throughout his life. On 14 November 1669 Cooper married Mary Cleere at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less, near Little Britain, the important centre of the London book trade where Cooper was to conduct his varied enterprises at a shop under the sign of the Pelican. His primary interests were occult, scientific, and medical books written in English, and his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Chymicall Books</span>, first issued in 1673, is an invaluable guide to book production in these specializations.<br>
<br>Records of books printed by and for Cooper, covering the period 1669&#150;89, and published lists of books available for purchase in his shop suggest that he enjoyed a flourishing business. He was interested in alchemy and chemical medicine and had a special preference for works by the pseudonymous Eirenaeus Philalethes, George Starkey, whose <span class="italic">Secrets Reveal'd, or, An Open Entrance to the Shut-Palace of the King</span> (1669) was the first volume printed for sale by Cooper. It was followed by additional Philalethean works, editions of other alchemical authors, and collections of alchemical tracts, such as the <span class="italic">Aurifontina chymica</span> (1680), dedicated to Charles II, and the <span class="italic">Collectanea chymica</span> (1684). In addition to works ranging from ephemerides to editions of William Barton's <span class="italic">Select Hymns</span>, Cooper also published scientific and technical titles such as those of Thomas Houghton and Gabriel Plattes on mining and William Simpson's works on spas and mineral waters.<br>
<br>Cooper was, in all likelihood, the author of <span class="italic">A philosophicall epitaph in hierogliphicall figures &hellip; published by W. C. esq with a catalogue of chymicall bookes</span> (1673). This curiously complex work features an engraved title-page and symbolic illustrations for which Cooper provides interpretive commentary; these are followed by his own translations of Johann Friedrich Helvetius's <span class="italic">Briefe of the Golden Calfe</span>, Johann Rudolph Glauber's <span class="italic">The Golden Ass Well Managed</span>, and <span class="italic">Jehior, the Day Dawning</span>, usually attributed to Paul Felgenhauer. The book's addresses to the reader and dedications to Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole, the latter alluding to past illness and unspecified &#145;Long troubles&#146;, reveal that Cooper seriously believed in alchemy, in both its physical and esoteric aspects. In his commentary, Christian, millenarian, cabbalistic, and neoplatonic ideas are intermingled, but his approach to physical alchemy and physic is primarily that of Paracelsus and Van Helmont.<br>
<br>As the final section of the <span class="italic">Philosophicall Epitaph</span> of 1673, Cooper added <span class="italic">A catalogue of chymicall books which have been written originally, or translated into English</span>. Not narrowly &#145;chymicall&#146; in coverage, this list includes sixteenth- and seventeenth-century books on magic, astronomy, physic, and pharmacy&#151;both Galenical and Paracelsian&#151;Rosicrucianism, and &#145;chemical philosophy&#146;, as well as many works which, in their empirical and inductive emphasis, were more closely allied with the &#145;new science&#146;. The <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> contains more than 180 main entries that provided the basis for two expanded and corrected versions. In 1675 he compiled a <span class="italic">Second Part</span> containing additional book entries, and a <span class="italic">Third Part</span> consisting of a ten-year index to items published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> which pertain to &#145;Chymistry, or the Study of Nature by Art in the Animal, Vegetal or Mineral Kingdoms&#146;. In 1688, he added a <span class="italic">Continuation or Appendix to the Second Part</span>, consisting of corrections, rectifications, or additions of books entries up to that year. Now exceedingly rare, this <span class="italic">Continuation</span> brought the total number of main entries to approximately 430. By extending his booklist thirteen years beyond the 1675 edition, Cooper provided a much fuller inventory of books that had been published and were available for purchase in late Restoration England. The earliest work listed in the <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> is Hieronymus von Braunschweig's <span class="italic">Vertuose Boke of Distyllacyon of the Waters of All Manner of Herbes</span> (1527), and one of the latest, and the only entry by a female writer, is Mrs Mary Trye's <span class="italic">Medicatrix, or, The Woman-Physician</span> (1675).<br>
<br>Primarily as the result of a large number of extant sale catalogues, knowledge of Cooper's activities as England's first book auctioneer is more complete than for any other aspect of his life. His auctioneering began on 31 October 1676 with the sale of the Lazarus Seaman library, included at least twenty-two sales, and ended in June 1688; his printed catalogues contain much additional information on the frequency and dates of his sales, his clients (who included Nathan Paget, Milton's doctor, and Richard Davis, Oxford bookseller), and estimates of the number of books included in certain of the sales. He was keenly aware of his historic role in this new method of bookselling in England, which was patterned after those used in Leiden and Amsterdam, and established a format and procedures to regulate this business. His auctioneering fame and that of his sometime partner Edward Millington are humorously celebrated in George Smalridge's Latin poem <span class="italic">Auctio Davisiana Oxonii habita, per Gul. Cooper &amp; Edward Millington bibliopol</span> (1689). Cooper died in February 1689. His widow, Mary, succeeded to the business.<br>
