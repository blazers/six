<span class="headword">Brophy,  Brigid Antonia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Brigid Antonia Levey, Lady Levey]</span>  (1929&#150;1995), <span class="occ">writer and campaigner</span>, was born at 79 Uxbridge Road, Ealing, London, on 12 June 1929, the second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56903/', "John Brophy (1899&#150;1965)")</script>, a Liverpool-born writer and editor of Irish descent, and his wife, Charis Weare Grundy (1895/6&#150;1975), teacher and novelist. Her mother had been born in Chicago, the daughter of James Grundy, a Scottish archangel (bishop) of the Catholic Apostolic church, but was brought up in Liverpool, and Brigid was baptized into the Anglican church. Because an elder sibling died in infancy before Brigid was born, she was in effect an only child. Her father recognized that she was precocious and encouraged her to read and write from an early age. &#145;Any ability I have as an adult to write English prose,&#146; she said, &#145;I learned from him and from reading the masters he directed me to, Bernard Shaw and Evelyn Waugh&#146;  (<span class="italic">King of a Rainy Country</span>, afterword, 276). She was educated at numerous schools, both state and private, including a preparatory school for boys where her mother was head teacher, the Abbey School, Reading, and St Paul's School for Girls, which she left at fifteen. After a spell at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts and secretarial college, in 1947 she gained a scholarship to St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she read classics but was sent down for unspecified sexual misdemeanours at the end of her fourth term. She began earning her living as a shorthand-typist.<br>
<br>Brophy claimed that she was writing verse dramas at the age of fifteen, but the first book that she published was a volume of short stories, <span class="italic">The Crown Princess</span>, which appeared in 1953 to highly laudatory notices. She nevertheless expunged the book from her bibliography because, as she put it, &#145;I can recognize no connection between it and me&#146;  (&#145;My first book&#146;, 97). In the same year she also published her first novel, <span class="italic">Hackenfeller's Ape</span>, inspired by hearing the lions roaring when she lived opposite Regent's Park Zoo. It started out as a &#145;narrative poem on the (alas, still visionary) theme of the liberation of animals&#146;  (ibid.), a subject that she was to write about frequently, but it evolved into a short novel, written in two weeks, and won the Cheltenham Literary Festival prize for a first novel. (Iris Murdoch was the runner-up, and subsequently became a close friend.) One result of writing the book, in which someone attempts to prevent an ape from being sent into space, was that Brophy became a vegetarian.<br>
<br>On her twenty-fifth birthday, 12 June 1954, Brophy married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100642/', "Michael Vincent Levey (1927&#150;2008)")</script>, assistant keeper at the National Gallery, son of Otto Lemuel Herbert Levey, assistant director at the Ministry of Supply. The couple lived at 23 Earls Court Square, London, and had one daughter. Though both Brophy and Levey came to regard marriage as &#145;an immoral social institution we ought never to have subscribed to&#146;  (&#145;My first book&#146;, 98) their own was something that Brophy said she rejoiced in every day. It nevertheless remained distinctly unconventional, accommodating a long period when Brophy was in love with the novelist Maureen Duffy.<br>
<br>Brophy's second novel, <span class="italic">The King of a Rainy Country</span> (1956), in which a young woman given the author's baptismal name of Susan goes in search of a girl with whom she had been in love at school, is the most straightforwardly autobiographical of her books, although every one of them is steeped in the author's personality and beliefs. Brophy was determinedly experimental as a writer, and each of her novels was different in style and form from its predecessors, but together with her many works of non-fiction these books constitute a highly coherent and distinctive <i>&#339;uvre</i>. Her first work of non-fiction was <span class="italic">Black Ship to Hell</span> (1962), which started out as an attempt to &#145;psycho-analyse the Greek myth of the Underworld&#146;  (p. 19), but ended up as a wide-ranging and characteristically allusive study of &#145;man as a destructive and, more particularly, self-destructive animal&#146;  (p. 13) who can only be saved by a Freudian examination of these impulses. It endeavoured to formulate a morality based on reason rather than religion&#151;Brophy described herself as &#145;a natural, logical and happy atheist&#146;  (<span class="italic">King of a Rainy Country</span>, afterword, 276). The influence of Freud is discernible in her third novel, <span class="italic">Flesh</span> (1962), just as her critical study <span class="italic">Mozart the Dramatist</span> (1964) informs her operatic novel <span class="italic">The Snow Ball</span>, published in the same year. <span class="italic">The Finishing Touch</span> (1963), set in the romantic hothouse of a girls' finishing school (the headmistress of which was based on her husband's art-historian colleague Anthony Blunt), is a pastiche of Ronald Firbank, a writer whom she championed in her vast critical work <span class="italic">Prancing Novelist</span> (1973). The latter book is a dazzlingly speculative and passionately argued investigation of an inventive and neglected writer with whom Brophy clearly identified. (She wrote the book in the same violet ink that Firbank customarily used.) It is subtitled &#145;A defence of fiction in the form of a critical biography of Ronald Firbank&#146;, and in it Brophy argued that &#145;works of art have and need no justification but themselves&#146;  (p. 70) and that &#145;good fiction is positively and absolutely good&#146;  (p. xiii). Fiction&#151;and other writing&#151;that was not good came under attack in <span class="italic">Fifty Works of English and American Literature we could Do Without</span> (1967), a squib written in collaboration with her husband and their friend Charles Osborne.<br>
<br>Whether or not what writers did was &#145;useful&#146; Brophy believed that they should be properly paid, and was a driving force behind the campaign to introduce public lending right (PLR), a scheme by which authors were annually paid a kind of royalty, out of government funds, when their books were borrowed from public libraries. The idea had first been posited by her father in 1951, but it was the Writers Action Group, founded by Brophy, Maureen Duffy, Michael Levey, Francis King, and Lettice Cooper in 1972, that overcame the opposition of librarians and through persistent lobbying ensured that PLR came into force by an act of parliament in 1979. (Brophy's <span class="italic">A Guide to Public Lending Right</span> was published in 1983.) This and other campaigns resulted in Brophy becoming well known as a controversialist during the 1960s, both in print and in broadcasting, and one of her favourite tactics was to pronounce the most heterodox opinions as if they were universal truths. She usefully filled a role similar to that of Gore Vidal in the United States, wittily challenging national complacency and goading her fellow citizens until they were roused from their habitual torpor. She often appeared on the satirical television show <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span>, and a talk commissioned by BBC radio at the time of the Profumo affair was so scathing about sexual hypocrisy in Britain that the corporation declined to broadcast it. She was a fervent anti-vivisectionist and a campaigner against blood sports (including angling), who allowed her beloved Persian cat, Darius, meat only because felines require a carnivorous diet; she was an outspoken opponent of the campaign against pornography, and wrote a booklet for the Secular Society, <span class="italic">Lord Longford's Threat to Freedom</span> (1972); and she was an early and articulate supporter of homosexual rights. Her forthright views, and the vigour with which she expressed them, were (she complained) sometimes mistaken for pugnacity. She conceded that her &#145;Irishly rational tone of voice is infuriating to some readers&#151;or, rather, to some reviewers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prancing Novelist</span>, 48), but Edward Blishen captured the particular quality of her writing when he observed: &#145;She has always the gift of a most stirring sort of firmness. It is not the tone of a know-all, it is not remotely bossy; it is, I suppose, basically, the sound that logic makes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reads</span>, cover).<br>
<br>Brophy's other works of non-fiction include <span class="italic">Don't Never Forget</span> (1966), a collection of &#145;views and reviews&#146;, two characteristically enthusiastic and idiosyncratic books on Aubrey Beardsley, and <span class="italic">The Prince and the Wild Geese</span> (1983), in which a series of watercolours by a young Irish woman is used as the basis for an imaginative recreation of the artist's romance with a Russian prince. Brophy's most challenging novel is <span class="italic">In Transit</span> (1969), a Joycean &#145;trans-sexual adventure&#146;  (cover of 1971 reprint) in which gender, identity, and syntax blur and meld, and which is set, appropriately, in the no-man's-land of an airport. <span class="italic">Palace without Chairs</span> (1978), subtitled &#145;a baroque novel&#146;, is a subversive, Ruritanian romance, once again influenced by Firbank. Brophy also wrote two plays, one of which, an unorthodox bedroom farce entitled <span class="italic">The Burglar</span>, was produced unsuccessfully in the West End in 1967; in the following year she published the text with a long and discursive preface in which many of her ideas about drama, writing, and her public reputation are rehearsed. Her one excursion into writing for juveniles, <span class="italic">Pussy Owl</span> (1976), was read by James Cossins on the popular BBC children's programme <span class="italic">Jackanory</span> and was subsequently published, with illustrations by Hilary Hayton.<br>
<br>Brophy was quite tall, &#145;soncy&#146; (as she would put it), with striking blue eyes emphasized by fair hair and very fair skin. She was a stylish dresser, fond of jewellery. In 1983 she was diagnosed as suffering from multiple sclerosis, and gradually became incapacitated. She nevertheless remained resolutely opposed to any medical research involving the use of animals. She continued to write as long as she was physically able, producing two collections of essays and journalism: <span class="italic">Baroque-'n'-Roll</span> (1987), which includes an account of her illness, and <span class="italic">Reads</span> (1989). She wrote new introductions and afterwords to reissues of her novels, but none remained in print very long and they even became hard to find in libraries. She remained philosophical about this neglect, remarking of Firbank, but also thinking of herself: &#145;People are a bit debased about what they expect in fiction. When it isn't there and so much is wittily left out, I think they get confused&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Firbank's estimation of his own work&#151;that it was &#145;aggressive, witty, &amp; unrelenting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prancing Novelist</span>, 69)&#151;might equally be applied to Brophy.<br>
<br>Brophy eventually became confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Levey, who had become keeper of the National Gallery (and had been knighted in 1981), left his job in order to look after her. In 1991 the Leveys left the flat in the Old Brompton Road where they had lived for twenty-six years and moved to Louth, in Lincolnshire. When she needed full-time professional care Brophy entered the Fir Close Nursing Home, Westgate, Louth, where she died, of pneumonia and multiple sclerosis, on 7 August 1995. She was cremated at Grimsby.<br>
