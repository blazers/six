<span class="headword">Lister,  Martin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1712), <span class="occ">physician and naturalist</span>, was baptized on 11 April 1639 at Radclive, Buckinghamshire, fourth of the ten children of Sir Martin Lister (1602&#150;1670), farmer and MP for Brackley, and his second wife, Susanna (1604?&#150;1669), widow of Sir Gifford Thornhurst (<i>d</i>. 1627), and daughter of Sir Alexander Temple of St Margaret's, near Rochester in Kent, and his first wife, Mary. In 1646 Sir Martin moved with his family to the manor of Thorpe Arnold, Leicestershire. Young Martin is said, by Anthony Wood, to have been educated under the care of his great-uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16764/', "Sir Matthew Lister MD")</script>, who was childless. He attended Melton Mowbray School and was admitted as a pensioner to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1655. The following year Sir Matthew died and the family moved to his old home, the manor of Burwell, Lincolnshire, to which Martin returned after graduating BA in 1659. At the Restoration he was appointed fellow of St John's College by royal mandate. It is probable that he owed this to his great-uncle's service as physician to the king's father and grandfather.<br>
<br>In 1663 Lister travelled to France, joining other English scholars at Montpellier. Protestants could not enrol at the university, but Lister was able to join an academy through which he studied medicine, anatomy, and botany. He travelled a lot, notably for a few months in 1665&#150;6 with John Ray and Philip Skippon, when they made observations on the natural history of the countryside, and when they travelled back to England.<br>
<br>Lister and Ray became firm friends and began a correspondence on scientific matters that lasted more than ten years. Meanwhile Lister did a little teaching at St John's College, but he secured some financial independence through a settlement of land by his father. In the summer of 1669 he resigned his fellowship and married, in York, Hannah (1645&#150;1695), daughter of Thomas Parkinson of Carleton Hall in Craven, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>The Listers moved to Hannah's home for the birth of her first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58454/', "Susanna Lister")</script>, while Lister explored the natural history of Craven. In 1670 he established a medical practice at York. Here were born other children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57844/', "Anne Lister")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58454/', "Lister, Susanna")</script>], Michael, Frances, Dorothy, Alexander, Barbara, and Jane. He gathered around him a club of virtuosi, including the artists Francis Place and William Lodge, who illustrated some of Lister's works. Lister continued his correspondence with John Ray, and with Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal Society. Several of his letters were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, and in 1671 Lister was admitted as fellow of the Royal Society. He continued to publish there and wrote his first book, the <span class="italic">Historia animalium Angliae tres tractatus</span> (1678&#150;81), of which the first part was a systematic description of English spiders and their habits, while the others were about terrestrial and marine molluscs. Other books followed, on insects (translation of work by the Dutch entomologist Goedart), mineral waters, and Lister's collected papers from the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>In September 1683 the Lister family moved to London. Martin Lister began to participate regularly in meetings of the Royal Society and was elected to its council. However, lacking a medical degree he would not have been permitted by the Royal College of Physicians to practise medicine in London. Perhaps it was to win goodwill at Oxford that, in 1682, shortly after the opening of the Ashmolean Museum, he had made substantial donations to it of books, manuscripts, antiquities, and other specimens. In March 1684 he was granted a DM by the University of Oxford. Two months later he was accepted by the Royal College of Physicians, and began to practise medicine among the highest levels of society, including attending the post-mortem of Charles II. When James II renewed the charter of the Royal College in 1687 Lister was named a fellow; in 1694 he was elected censor.<br>
<br>In January 1685 Lister was elected vice-president of the Royal Society. Since the president, Samuel Pepys, was often absent, Lister chaired most of the meetings that year. But his attendance ended abruptly, early in 1686, although he continued to contribute to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. He frequently attended the weekly meetings of the Temple Coffee House club of naturalists in the 1690s. His chief activity in natural history at this time was the preparation of a classified set of copperplate-engravings of all known shells, largely executed by his eldest children, Susanna and Anne. The work is divided into four sections, the first of which (on land snails) was issued in 1685 under the title <span class="italic">De cochleis</span>, the others following in successive years. Sets were sent to friends for review and each was continually revised: the final version, <span class="italic">Historia sive synopsis methodica conchyliorum</span>, with over a thousand plates, was not completed until 1697. He also published, in three parts, descriptions of the internal anatomy of Mollusca: <span class="italic">Exercitatio anatomica</span> (1694&#150;6). He published a set of essays on common diseases, <span class="italic">Sex exercitationes medicinales de quibusdam morbis chronicis</span> (1694), in order &#145;to stop the censorious mouthes who thinke and say a man that writes on Insects can be but a trifler in Physic&#146;  (BL, MS Ashmole 1816, fol. 113).<br>
<br>Two of the Listers' children died while still young. A tablet in Westminster Abbey bears the simple but eloquent statement &#145;Jane Lister, dear Childe, died Oct 7th, 1688&#146;. Hannah Lister died in 1695 and was buried at St Paul's Church, Clapham. The only surviving son, Alexander, matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in the same year, but in 1697 earned his father's displeasure by an imprudent marriage. In October 1698 Martin Lister married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1736), daughter of Peter Cullen.<br>
<br>Late in 1697 William Bentinck, Lord Portland, was sent on a diplomatic mission to Paris, and Lister accompanied him as physician. His duties left him ample time to meet and talk with other intellectuals, to see their collections and gardens, and to explore the city. He was there for six months and shortly after his return published <span class="italic">A Journey to Paris in the Year 1698</span> (1699). The book ran to three editions within a year, but was lampooned by William King for its supposed triviality. In fact it is a unique first-hand account of Parisian scientific society, and a useful description of the city and its life.<br>
<br>Lister was asthmatic: he enjoyed the dry air of France, but not the &#145;choakie air of London&#146;  (BL, MS Ashmole 1816, fol. 126). In 1699 he and Jane moved from London, taking lodgings at Leatherhead, and in 1702 they moved to Epsom, though he still travelled to London when necessary. He had a useful connection at court: Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, was Lister's niece by his mother's first marriage, and a close friend of Queen Anne. In 1702 he became fourth physician to the queen. At Epsom he spent much time in his garden, but continued to write. He translated the aphorisms of Sanctorius and Hippocrates (1702), and a Roman cookery book in <span class="italic">De arte coquinaria</span> (1705). His last works were published in 1709: an essay on body fluids, <span class="italic">Dissertatio de humoribus</span>, and an account of British beetles appended to John Ray's <span class="italic">Historia insectorum</span>. In 1710 he was appointed second physician to the queen, but he died at Epsom on 2 February 1712, and was buried beside his first wife at Clapham, where there was formerly a monument to his memory. He was commemorated by Robert Brown in the genus <i>Listeria</i> among orchids.<br>
<br>Martin Lister was a successful and respected physician who had the gift of &#145;hitting distempers&#146;  (Gunther, 288) but is better remembered for his work in natural history. In both fields he was initially a keen observer and had some good ideas, but later became more conservative. He was reluctant to use a microscope because, by revealing details of tiny creatures, it seemed to be disrespectful to the ancients. His advice to a prospective medical student in 1698 was to study &#145;the ancients &hellip; he will find that all the rest have added little&#146;  (BL, MS Ashmole 1818, fol. 124). His career was marked by contentious relations with other physicians, with fellows of the Royal Society, and with two of his children. In natural history he was the first to study spiders, making detailed observations on their structure and behaviour. He was the first to suggest that rocks might be characterized by their fossil contents, and to propose the creation of geological maps. A painstaking observer, he was well aware of the differences between fossils and modern shells and was therefore prepared to accept that they were &#145;formed stones&#146; (like crystals). &#145;If otherwise, the animals they so exactly represent have become extinct&#146;  (Stearns, xlvi). He was the first to attempt a comparative anatomy of the Mollusca, and his <span class="italic">Historia conchyliorum</span> was the bible of conchologists for over a hundred years. It is for that work that he is chiefly remembered.<br>
