<span class="headword">Hayward,  Ronald George Still <span class="st"> [Ron]</span></span>  (1917&#150;1996), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born on 27 June 1917 in Bloxham, Oxfordshire, the son of Ethel Ruth Hayward, milliner. He was brought up by his grandparents. After attending a local Bloxham Church of England school, he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to a cabinet-maker, a training that was to lead to predictable jokes during the period of the Wilson and Callaghan governments, when he was general secretary of the Labour Party. He served during the war in the RAF. He attended the RAF technical schools at Halton, Cosford, and Locking, and after being appointed a technical training instructor reached senior non-commissioned rank. On 9 October 1943 he married Phyllis Olive Allen (<i>b</i>. 1920/21), a corporal in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and daughter of Charles Allen, publican. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>At the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Hayward joined the Labour Party agency service and became secretary/agent to the constituency Labour Party in Banbury, an area held for the Conservatives by Andrew Douglas Dodds-Parker, and then, in 1947, agent for Rochester and Chatham, held by Arthur Bottomley, under-secretary of state for the colonies. Bottomley was away negotiating independence for Burma, which meant that unusual responsibility fell on Hayward. Hayward's success in holding a difficult seat in the general election of 1950 led to promotion as assistant regional organizer for the Labour Party in the southern region. He was appointed to the top post in the same region in 1959.<br>
<br>On the retirement of Dame Sara Barker from the post of national agent of the Labour Party in 1969, Hayward was preferred by a left-wing national executive to the favourite for the job, the assistant national agent, Reg Underhill. Three years later he succeeded Sir Harry Nicholas as general secretary of the party, owing his election to the left in general, and to Tony Benn's casting vote as party chairman in particular. It had been assumed that the deputy general-secretary, Gwynn Morgan, would succeed to the post. Hayward had been a notable opponent of the right-wing bureaucrats who controlled the party machinery in the 1950s and 1960s. Because his regime as general secretary was more open, he was partly blamed for the continual confrontation between right and left, and for the internal warfare that led to the impotence of the party. After defeat in 1979 people tended to forget that it was Hayward, as general secretary, who had delivered two general election victories, against expectation, in 1974. Critics were especially angry that in the wake of Labour's defeat at the general election of 1979, Hayward roundly declared that the election had been lost because the Labour government had failed not merely to carry out conference resolutions and TUC decisions, but even to include them in the party's manifesto; &#145;I wish sometimes that our prime ministers would act in <i>our</i> interests, as a Tory prime minister acts in theirs&#146;, he added  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 March 1996). Asked why there was a &#145;winter of discontent&#146; in 1978&#150;9, he retorted: &#145;Because the Cabinet, supported by MPs, ignored Congress and Conference decisions. In my 46 years of membership of this party, I've never yet seen it try Socialism in any sense!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 26 March 1996). If in the end the Trotskyite Militant Tendency went too far for Hayward&#151;one of his last actions before retirement in 1982 was to urge the national executive committee to take action against it&#151;he remained an idealist of the left. He was wonderfully supported by his equally idealist and committed wife, Phyllis. He was appointed CBE in 1970. He died at his home, 37 Sutherland Drive, Birchington, Kent, on 22 March 1996, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife and their three daughters.<br>
