<span class="headword">Belle,  Alexis-Simon</span>  (1674&#150;1734), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 12 January 1674, in the rue du Bac, Paris, and baptized on 17 January at St Sulpice, Paris, the second child but only son of Jean Belle (1636/1641&#150;1703), portrait painter, and Anne Malguy (<i>d</i>. 1705). He trained initially with his father, then became a pupil in the early 1690s of Fran&ccedil;ois de Troy, one of the painters at the exiled court of James II at St Germain-en-Laye.<br>
<br>Belle's career at St Germain started about 1698&#150;1701, a period of peace between France and England, when it was easy for British travellers to cross the channel carrying with them small portraits of the prince of Wales (James Edward Stuart, Stuart claimant to the British throne), and his sister Princess Louise Marie. Troy, by then the only painter still working for James II, was commissioned to produce more portraits than he could manage and invited Belle, his most able pupil, to collaborate. During these three years they produced many copies of Troy's portraits of which over twenty-five are now known, mainly of the prince of Wales. Belle became so busy that when he won the prix de Rome in August 1700 he preferred to continue his Jacobite commissions than to travel to Italy.<br>
<br>Belle also produced some original compositions, the earliest of which seem to date from 1698, when the prince of Wales was ten and Princess Louise Marie was six (priv. colls.). In 1699 he produced a large allegorical portrait showing the former as a guardian angel, leading his sister under the protection of cherubim (Royal Collection). At about the same time he also painted <span class="italic">Mary of Modena</span> (Sizergh Castle, Cumbria). On 12 November 1701, when he married the miniature painter Anne Ch&eacute;ron (<i>c</i>.1663&#150;1718), he described himself as &#145;peintre ordinaire du Roy d'Angleterre&#146;. James II had died in September of that year, but Belle continued to work for his son.<br>
<br>War was renewed between France and England in 1702, and in the years that followed Belle replaced Troy as the official painter of the Jacobite court, where he and his wife quickly became integrated into the British community and where he settled permanently. Chiefly he concentrated on producing portraits of James Stuart and his sister, some of them copied as miniatures by his wife, to be smuggled into Britain. Belle also worked for various Jacobite courtiers and the nuns of the English Augustinian convent in Paris. By 1705 he was doing so well that he was able to invest annually in the government &#145;rentes&#146;.<br>
<br>Belle was elected to the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture in August 1703 when he submitted a number of portraits including a three-quarter-length portrait of his former master, <span class="italic">Fran&ccedil;ois de Troy</span> (Ch&acirc;teau de Versailles); he exhibited nine portraits in the Salon the following year. Three portraits showed members of the court at St Germain and two showed James Stuart and his sister. The demand for portraits of James Stuart was so great that by 1706 he was employing a small atelier to help him. One of these portraits, engraved by Le Roi, first brought the painter's name to the attention of the British public.<br>
<br>Belle's most significant composition from this period is a whole-length portrait of James Stuart, dated 1703 (Coll&egrave;ge des Ecossais, Paris). It shows him in armour standing beside the channel, on which several warships can be seen. He is pointing towards the cliffs and castle of Dover and is accompanied by a page in Polish costume. A similar three-quarter-length painting was produced by Troy in 1704 (Parham House, Sussex), without either the page or the view of Dover. These two portraits were frequently copied and it seems that Belle continued to copy Troy's portrait as well as his own until approximately 1707. Belle also made several copies (examples are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, and priv. coll.) of a small portrait of Princess Louise Marie by Troy (National Portrait Gallery, London) which dates from these years.<br>
<br>Belle's most famous portrait of James Stuart was painted in 1712 during the negotiations for the treaty of Utrecht, just before James was obliged to leave St Germain for Lorraine. He is portrayed in military costume inside a tent (Gov. Art Coll.). This portrait quickly became the standard image of the exiled Jacobite claimant to the throne and was copied many times. In an engraving of the portrait by Fran&ccedil;ois Ch&eacute;reau that was widely circulated in England and Scotland Belle was described as &#145;peintre de S. M. Brit&#146;. This portrait was paired with Belle's portrait of Princess Louise Marie (<i>c</i>.1710, Sizergh Castle) which was engraved posthumously by Ch&eacute;reau in 1713.<br>
<br>Belle remained at St Germain after the departure of James Stuart and produced portraits of some of the diplomats associated with the treaty of Utrecht. In 1714 he was invited by James Stuart to join his court at Bar-le-Duc, where he continued to produce portraits of the Jacobite exiles. He also painted James Stuart in profile (Gov. Art Coll.) and in the robes of a knight of the Garter (lost), a work known through an engraving by Marie-Nicolle Horthemels and which resulted in commissions for similar portraits from the other Jacobite Garter knights.<br>
<br>By this time Belle's reputation as a portraitist was assured in Great Britain and in the years 1716&#150;19 he received many commissions from English and Scottish Jacobites in exile after the rising of 1715. By then James Stuart lived in Italy, but in the winter of 1717/18 he employed Belle to make copies of the first portrait of him to be painted in Rome, by Antonio David.<br>
<br>During the 1720s Belle worked increasingly for French patrons. His numerous portraits of the French court and nobility included <span class="italic">Louis XV</span> (Ch&acirc;teau de Versailles). The many contemporary engravings after his work give some indication of his status in France. He continued also to receive commissions from Jacobites in Paris; in 1724 he signed himself &#145;pictor regis Britann&#146; on a portrait of James Stuart's sister-in-law, Marie-Charlotte Sobieska (Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore). A project for Belle to make copies in 1727 of a portrait by David of James Stuart's wife, Maria-Clementina Sobieska, seems to have come to nothing, but in 1731 Belle did make two copies of each of David's portraits of James Stuart's two sons.<br>
<br>As a court portraitist Belle worked in the style developed in France by Troy, Hyacinthe Rigaud, and Nicolas de Largilli&egrave;re, though his greatest debt was to Troy, his former master. His portrait of James Stuart as a Garter knight was influenced by Benedetto Gennari's portrait of James II. Belle might not have been very original in his compositions, but he was praised for his exceptional skill in accurately reproducing a likeness of his subject. About twenty-five of his Jacobite portraits are known to have survived, in addition to the much larger number that show the exiled Stuart family.<br>
<br>Belle's first wife died in April 1718 and on 12 January 1722 he married the engraver Marie-Nicolle Horthemels (1689&#150;1745); they had two sons (1722, 1726) and a daughter (1730). His elder son was the history painter Cl&eacute;ment-Louis Belle. Belle continued to live with the Jacobite community at St Germain, where he owned two properties, until his death at his home in the rue du Four, Paris, on 21 November 1734. He was buried on 22 November in St Sulpice, Paris.<br>
