<span class="headword">Warburton, Sir  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1621), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the elder son of Thomas Warburton, of Nantwich, Cheshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Richard Maisterson of Nantwich, &#145;a gentlewoman of good discent&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 85, fol. 118). After attending Staple Inn, Warburton entered Lincoln's Inn on 2 May 1562, and was called to the bar in February 1572, together with Thomas Egerton. Two years later a former fellow student jokingly lamented his abandonment of bachelorhood to marry (on 4 October 1574) Margaret Barlow, of Dransfield, Derbyshire, with whom he would have two daughters. Promoted bencher in 1582, he delivered the Lent reading of 1584 on the statute 21 Henry VIII c. 15 (falsifying recoveries).<br>
<br>Already JP for the county and legal counsel to the town of Chester, where he had possibly owned a house since 1579, Warburton was recommended by the earl of Leicester, chamberlain of the palatinate of Chester, for one of the borough's seats in the parliament of 1584. Rebuffed on this occasion, he was still returned for Newcastle under Lyme, thanks to his own duchy of Lancaster connections. Warburton became an alderman of Chester in 1585 (as proposed the previous year by both Leicester and the earl of Derby), and represented the city in the parliaments of 1586, 1589, and 1597, declining nomination in 1593 on grounds of pressure of work. He had been appointed queen's attorney in the palatine courts of Chester and Lancaster in 1592, and vice-chamberlain of Chester the following year, when he also received a serjeant's writ. At the creation ceremony in Easter term 1594 Warburton invoked the names of two noble &#145;patrons&#146; (the earl of Derby and Lord Dudley), linking them with three common lawyers, the late master of the rolls, Sir Gilbert Gerard, his successor, Thomas Egerton, and another Lincoln's Inn man, the judge Thomas Walmsley.<br>
<br>Whether brought in to advise a fellow Lancaster lawyer on a complex conveyance, or earning &#145;credit and countenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 4.522) from a jury not initially predisposed in his favour, Warburton's abilities and legal learning gained respect from both laymen and professional colleagues. Several surviving copies of his reports of cases in the court of common pleas run from the year of his serjeantcy. Warburton was raised to the common pleas bench on 24 November 1600. The displeasure of the formidable Dowager Lady Russell, whom he had the misfortune to cross shortly afterwards, did not damage his relationship with her nephew Robert Cecil. Confirmed as judge following James I's accession, when he was also knighted, Warburton served on a succession of important state trials, besides following the Oxford, midland, and Norfolk assize circuits. He also continued to accumulate property in and around Chester, including the manor of Grafton where he built an elaborate red brick house. Such conspicuous worldly success doubtless helped assuage anxieties underlying his ultimately successful claims to a version of the heraldic arms of the Warburtons of Arley, into which family he married after the death of his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Butler of Warrington, Lancashire. Alice Warburton also predeceased him.<br>
<br>Warburton died at Grafton Hall, Tilston, on 7 September 1621, and was buried in Tilston church, &#145;an ancient, reverend and learned judge &hellip; [who] made a good end of this life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Hutton</span>, 40). After an orthodox Calvinist preamble his holograph will left his surviving daughter, Elizabeth Stanley, to supervise cash bequests totalling nearly &pound;1800, and gifts of books by Bellarmine, Calvin, Camden, Foxe, Luther, and Speed, plus &#145;all my manuscripts and written bookes of the Lawes of England&#146;  (Ches. &amp; Chester ALSS, MF 164/2).<br>
