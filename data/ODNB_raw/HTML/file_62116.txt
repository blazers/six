<span class="headword">Clarkson,  Mabel Maria</span>  (1875&#150;1950), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born at The Priory, Calne, Wiltshire, on 1 June 1875, the daughter of Richard Clarkson, a solicitor, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Prince. She had an elder brother and three elder sisters. She was educated at a private school in Reading, but by the early twentieth century had settled in Norwich, which led to a lifetime of social, philanthropic, and political service.<br>
<br>In 1904, standing as a Liberal, Clarkson was elected a member of the Norwich board of poor-law guardians for Ber Street ward, which she continued to represent until 1925. In 1911 she joined Norwich's distress committee, where she took a particular interest in the problems of unemployed women, who were often neglected in relief programmes. Elected in 1913 a Liberal councillor for Town Close ward of Norwich borough council, she was the first and for some time the only woman in the council chamber. Her election addresses, which highlighted the effects on infant mortality and public health generally of overcrowding, supported municipal housebuilding. She went on to chair the city's public assistance committee (later to become the social welfare committee). In 1922 she was appointed a magistrate, soon after that office was first opened to women.<br>
<br>Clarkson lost her council seat in 1923 but was re-elected in 1926 for Heigham ward, having joined the Labour Party, one of many progressive women to make this transition from Liberalism in the 1920s  (Hollis, 68). Appointed to the ancient office of sheriff of Norwich in 1928, she was the first woman and first member of the Labour Party to be given this honour. In 1930 she became lord mayor of Norwich, the second woman to hold the office (Ethel Colman having been the first, in 1923), and in 1932 she was made an alderman. Failing health forced her retirement from the council's aldermanic bench in 1948. In 1931 she was made CBE.<br>
<br>Clarkson, who never married and was described as having independent means, also took part in numerous voluntary bodies, including the Norwich district visiting association, the League of Nations Union, and the local branch of the National Council of Women. She was for many years responsible for the Norwich schoolchildren's boot fund, which raised thousands of pounds to provide &#145;necessitous children with adequate footware&#146;. This piece of service was typical of a woman who dedicated her life to the welfare of others, and who realized that the only effective means of accomplishing her ideals was through local politics. After her death at her home, 5 Mount Pleasant, Norwich, on 20 March 1950, it was said in tribute that &#145;The public life of Norwich was the poorer when Mabel Clarkson left it. It is not given to many women, or men for that matter, to achieve such an enduring place in the history of their city&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eastern Evening News</span>).<br>
