<span class="headword">Clerk,  John</span>, Lord Eldin  (1757&#150;1832), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in April 1757, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5618/', "John Clerk")</script> of Eldin (1728&#150;1812), the author of <span class="italic">An Essay on Naval Tactics</span>, and his wife, Susannah Adam, sister of the celebrated Adam brothers, the architects. Though originally intended for the Indian Civil Service, he was apprenticed to a writer of the signet. His interest as a young man in debating and essaying upon literary, philosophical, and political topics can be inferred from his election to the recently established Speculative Society of Edinburgh during its 1777&#150;8 session. He appears to have been an active member and was elected a president for the 1782&#150;3 session. After serving his articles he practised for a year or two as an accountant, and eventually was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 3 December 1785.<br>
<br>Clerk soon made his mark at the bar, where he acquired so extensive a practice that, it is said, at one period of his career he had nearly half the business of the court in his hands. As a pleader he was remarkable, both for his acuteness and for his marvellous powers of reasoning, as well as for his fertility of resource. Possessed of a rough, sarcastic humour, he delighted in ridiculing the bench, and was in the habit of saying whatever he liked to the judges without reproof. When appearing as defence counsel for the co-accused in the sensational trial of Deacon William Brodie in 1788, he gained notoriety for his intemperate exchanges with the trial judge, Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield. On another celebrated occasion, probably between 1819 and 1823, after a prolonged wrangle, he was compelled by the court to apologize to Sir William Miller, Lord Glenlee, for a fiery retort. Even then, the apology was scornful: &#145;since <i>your Lordships insist upon't</i>, I now make an apology to Lord Glenlee, <span class="smallcap">IN RESPECT OF YOUR LORDSHIPS' COMMANDS</span>!!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.210). Apart from the trial of Deacon Brodie, his other prominent court appearances included appearing for the defence alongside his fellow advocates Francis Jeffrey and Henry Cockburn in the so-called state trials for sedition in 1817.<br>
<br>In politics Clerk was a keen whig. He made a notable contribution to the movement for burgh reform in the 1780s, serving on the standing committee which promoted (unsuccessfully) two parliamentary bills which addressed the reform of burgh government and parliamentary representation. On 11 March 1806 he was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland in the Grenville administration, where he played a leading role alongside Henry Erskine, the lord advocate, in attempting to reform the moribund court of session, sponsoring a radical parliamentary bill in 1807. Although the attempt failed owing to the fall of the ministry, it enshrined principles which provided the basis of the reforms of the subsequent two decades.<br>
<br>Clerk's practice at the bar had been for some time falling off, and his health had already begun to fail, when on 10 November 1823 he was appointed an ordinary lord of session in the place of William Macleod Bannatyne, Lord Bannatyne. Assuming the title Lord Eldin, he took his seat on the bench on 22 November. As a judge he was not a success; his temperament was not a judicial one, and his poor health rendered him unfit for the office. After five years of judicial work he resigned in 1828, and was succeeded by John Fullerton, Lord Fullerton.<br>
<br>Clerk had a considerable taste for fine arts, and occasionally amused himself in drawing and modelling. In appearance he was remarkably plain, and paid no attention to his dress. One of his legs was shorter than the other, leading to the anecdote that when walking down High Street one day from the court of session he overheard a young lady saying to her companion rather loudly, &#145;There goes Johnnie Clerk, the lame lawyer.&#146; Upon which he turned round and said, &#145;No, madam, I may be a lame man, but not a lame lawyer.&#146; Henry Cockburn remembered his &#145;very bushy eyebrows, coarse grizzly hair, always in disorder, and firm projecting features&#146;, which &#145;made his face and head not unlike that of a thorough-bred shaggy terrier&#146;  (Cockburn, <span class="italic">Life of Lord Jeffrey</span>, 1.200). He also described him as &#145;honest, warm-hearted, generous and simple&#146;  (ibid.) but suffering from &#145;infantine self-deification&#146;  (ibid., 1.201). His consulting room was overrun by his collection of art, literature, and animals: &#145;all manner of trash, dead and living, and all in confusion&#146;  (ibid., 1.204).<br>
<br>Clerk died unmarried at his house in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, on 30 May 1832. His collection of pictures and prints was sold by auction at his house in March 1833, a serious accident occurring when the floor gave way. It is reputed that the sale lasted fourteen days owing to the immense size of the collection.<br>
