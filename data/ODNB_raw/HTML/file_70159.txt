<span class="headword">Lyons,  Lewis</span>  (1862&#150;1918), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 20 November 1862, at 20 Fashion Street, Whitechapel, London, of German&#150;Jewish parents, Moses Lyons, a journeyman tailor, and his wife, Hannah Goldsmith. Educated at the Jews' Free School, Bell Lane, Spitalfields, from about 1869 to 1873, he left at eleven to start work as a tailor's machinist in one of the many small workshops in the East End of London. Of strong socialist convictions, he soon became acutely aware of the iniquities of the trade&#151;low wages and long hours of work (up to eighteen hours a day) in unhealthy conditions. This, he believed, was caused largely by the prevailing system, commonly known as &#145;sweating&#146;. Labour was subdivided, each worker being involved in making only a small part of each garment, with no apprenticeship available that would enable him or her to become a skilled tailor earning higher wages.<br>
<br>Lyons campaigned for the licensing, under strict conditions, of all workshops, improved physical conditions, a four-year apprenticeship, higher wages, and a shortened working day, with penal procedures to enforce compliance. Handsome and charismatic, Lyons speedily emerged despite his youth as the principal figure in London's Jewish tailoring trade unions, being involved, usually as secretary, in running no fewer than nine unions between 1885 and 1912. His constant agitation at his workplace, the poor pay his union employers could afford, and his behaviour at public demonstrations led to frequent dismissal, regular visits to his home by bailiffs, fines, and on two occasions short spells of imprisonment. He met his wife, Fanny, whom he married in 1887, while linking arms against the police at a Trafalgar Square protest meeting. The couple had two daughters. His constant shortage of funds, and the time he had to spend attending to his financial private affairs, may to some extent have obstructed his work.<br>
<br>To promote his ideals Lyons wrote widely in the local and national press, including articles in the <span class="italic">East London Observer</span>, <span class="italic">Jewish World</span>, the <span class="italic">Tailor and Cutter</span>, <span class="italic">The Briton</span>, and <span class="italic">Reynolds</span>, often under pseudonyms. The culmination of this activity was the production of his own penny monthly journal, <span class="italic">The Anti-Sweater</span>, that ran for eight editions from July 1886 to February 1887. He wrote, edited, and published the paper while working full time as a machinist. Invited to give evidence to the House of Lords select committee on the sweating system (1888) Lyons made an impressive wide-ranging survey of the state of the tailoring sweating industry, and detailed suggestions (though to some extent impractical) for improvement.<br>
<br>The following year was pivotal for London's immigrant tailors, and for Lyons's career. Public meetings of three tailoring unions resolved on a call for a strike to secure a twelve-hour working day and other improvements in working conditions. As chairman of the elected strike committee Lyons was its driving force. The strike, which began on 29 August 1889, was settled following the mediation of Lord Rothschild and Samuel Montagu. Though initially apparently successful, Lyons said later that within weeks the employers ignored the concessions they had made.<br>
<br>The 1890s was a difficult decade for unions because of a trade depression, and during this time Lyons fell foul of many of his socialist colleagues and earned their distrust. He became convinced that employees had interests similar to those of their immediate employers, who were themselves sub-contractors earning little more than their employees. Lyons believed they should combine forces and present a united front against the superior employers. This led to attacks upon him by trade unionists and anarchists for what were perceived to be capitalist leanings. He was accused of misappropriating funds of the Tailors', Machinists' and Pressers' Union without the members' sanction, though this remained unproven. &#145;How long&#146;, wrote the (Yiddish) <span class="italic">Arbiter Fraint</span>, &#145;will you allow yourselves and your union to come to such shame, by letting this man lead you by the nose? &hellip; Do you want a union which will be strong enough to press your interests? Then get rid of Lyons&#146;  (10 July 1891).<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Lyons settled with his family in Bristol, where he ran a tobacconist shop selling rolled cigars made by his wife; but by the turn of the century they had returned to London. He once again became involved in union affairs and in April 1911 was elected to sit on the tailoring trade board, but ill health forced his early retirement.<br>
<br>Lyons made an important contribution to developing trade unions, particularly among newly arrived Jewish immigrant workers. Completely independent of thought, he was not fazed by the eminence of his opponents, crossing swords with the chief rabbi, Hermann Adler, and speaking out fearlessly in favour of immigrants when giving evidence in 1903 to the royal commission on alien immigration. He told the commission that the 1901 census had revealed that there were 80,074 tailors and tailoresses in London alone; and when the chairman asked him to &#145;Call it 80,000&#146;, he replied &#145;No, my Lord, we will call it 80,100; we will not make it less than it is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Royal Commission</span>, q.14073).<br>
<br>Lewis Lyons died on 7 July 1918 at his home, 255 Franciscan Road, Tooting, Surrey, as impecunious as he had been throughout his life. He was a compassionate man, but did not truly appreciate when to subjugate his ideals to the reality of what could be achieved. In its obituary the <span class="italic">Jewish World</span> (24 July 1918) said that he was guided by a sense of the wrong the poor had to endure, and by the conviction that much of their suffering was avoidable. His work brought him no material advantage, a fact that marked him as one &#145;in whom was the spirit of service to his fellows&#146;.<br>
