<span class="headword">Macbride,  David</span>  (1726&#150;1778), <span class="occ">chemist and physician</span>, was born on 26 April 1726 at Ballymoney, co. Antrim, Ireland, one of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17365/', "Robert McBride (1686/7&#150;1759)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17361/', "McBride, John")</script>] and his wife, the daughter of Mr Boyd of Killabeg, co. Down. His father was a Scottish minister, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17362/', "John Macbride (d. 1800)")</script> was his brother. He was educated at the village school, and after serving an apprenticeship to a local surgeon he entered the Royal Navy, where he was a mate aboard a hospital ship and then a surgeon during the war of Austrian succession (1741&#150;8). The seafaring life enabled him to observe scurvy&#151;the scourge of the eighteenth-century British navy&#151;and this shaped his lifelong search for an effective antiscorbutic.<br>
<br>After the peace of 1748 Macbride studied anatomy with Monro Secundus in Edinburgh and with William Hunter in London, where he also studied midwifery with William Smellie. He returned to Ballymoney in 1749 and moved to Dublin in 1751. He soon won the affections of Dorcas Evory, but her father made her marry George Cumming, a Dublin merchant, and Macbride went on to marry Margaret Armstrong on 20 November 1753 at St Audoen's Church, Dublin. In due course, however, the widowed Macbride married his widowed &#145;first love&#146; in the same church on 5 June 1762. He had no children by either marriage.<br>
<br>Macbride set up practice as a surgeon and accoucheur in 1752, but bashfulness limited his practice for several years. His real abilities were known only to his family and close friends, who appreciated him not only for his pleasant nature and agreeable manner but also for his general knowledge of painting, music, and polite literature. Attracted to the Enlightenment world of polite and useful learning, he joined and read papers before the Medico-Philosophical Society, formed in 1756 in Dublin; he became its secretary in 1762. His medical practice expanded considerably in 1764, when the publication of his <span class="italic">Experimental Essays</span> brought him into notice and when the University of Glasgow made him MD. With this qualification in hand, Macbride started a course of medical lectures in his home in the winter of 1766&#150;7. He published them in 1772 as <span class="italic">A Methodical Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Physic</span>, which was translated into Latin in 1774 and reissued in an enlarged edition in Dublin in 1776. Macbride's interest in useful knowledge was also evident in December 1767, when he made a new discovery in the art of tanning, substituting lime-water for water in part of the process. For this discovery he was, in 1768, made an honorary member of the Dublin Royal Society, which also awarded him a silver medal. In 1769 the Society of Arts of London gave him a gold medal, and his &#145;Account of the improved method of tanning leather&#146; was published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of 1778.<br>
<br>Macbride is remembered mainly for his work on scurvy in his <span class="italic">Experimental Essays</span>. The object and method of his researches were characteristic of Enlightenment medicine, which looked to science to curb the diseases of modern institutional populations, in gaols, in hospital ships, and in military camps. The most important of these diseases were fevers. In the early 1750s John Pringle emphasized the putrid nature of gaol fever, dysentery, and scurvy, and tested various substances for their antiseptic or restorative qualities. Interpreting these results within a theoretical framework shaped by the work of Stephen Hales and Joseph Black in pneumatic (gas) chemistry, Macbride related putrefaction to the loss of fixed air (carbon dioxide) and the efficacy of antiseptics or antiscorbutics in the prevention of, or restoration from, this loss. As a cheap and readily available source of fixed air, Macbride recommended to the Admiralty in 1767 the use of fresh wort, or infusion of malt, in the treatment of scurvy. While his brother, Admiral John Macbride, reported some success with the remedy on a voyage in 1765&#150;7, the results obtained on Cook's expeditions were confused and ambiguous; in the early 1790s the Admiralty finally decided in favour of James Lind's recommendation of lemon juice. Macbride's experimental results also sparked Joseph Priestley's interest in the medicinal possibilities of the new gases he was discovering, and this research led to the work of Thomas Beddoes and the Pneumatic Institute.<br>
<br>The attention focused on Macbride in the wake of his <span class="italic">Experimental Essays</span> also had its adverse effects. The resulting demand for his medical services induced in his gentle and uncertain nature a state of chronic tension and insomnia. This enfeebling condition led to a fever, brought on by a cold, from which he died, in his house in Cavendish Row, Dublin, on 28 December 1778; he was buried in St Audoen's Church. Although a minor figure in eighteenth-century science and medicine, Macbride was nevertheless remembered by many&#151;not least the anxious women he aided through the perils of eighteenth-century birthing; for them he was &#145;the hope of weeping eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science</span>, 289).<br>
