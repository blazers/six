<span class="headword">Perry,  Sampson</span>  (1747&#150;1823?), <span class="occ">radical and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born at Aston, near Birmingham; nothing is known of his parents. Perry trained as a physician and practised as a surgeon in Aldersgate Street, London, in the 1760s and early 1770s. He claimed to have invented a cure for kidney stones, which he marketed as Adams Solvent. Perry published <span class="italic">A Disquisition</span> on bladder and kidney diseases (eight editions, 1772&#150;95), with <span class="italic">Observations</span> and <span class="italic">Further Observations</span> in 1789, and a dissertation on venereal diseases in 1786. He joined the East Middlesex militia in 1765, rising to lieutenant in 1777, surgeon in 1778, and captain in 1780. Though sympathetic to the American cause, on two occasions during the American War of Independence he raised volunteer companies to face the threat of invasion.<br>
<br>In early 1789 Perry and Jonathan King became the proprietors of <span class="italic">The Argus</span>, a new, moderate opposition newspaper. In 1792, as sole proprietor, Perry introduced a more radical stance, associating with the London Corresponding Society (LCS) and publishing contributions by Thomas Paine, John Horne Tooke, Maurice Margarot, and Jonathan King. Perry faced several prosecutions for libel on the government between June and September 1792, and was twice sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He continued to edit <span class="italic">The Argus</span> from prison, and his release was followed by further prosecutions for libel. An article, arguing that the House of Commons did not represent the people, led to a warrant's being issued for his arrest. Perry left for France in late September 1792, to avoid prosecution, was tried for libel in his absence, and found guilty in December. He was outlawed and his property seized in January 1793, and a &pound;100 reward offered for his capture.<br>
<br>Perry considered emigrating to America but, through Paine, had many connections in Paris and soon became closely involved with &eacute;migr&eacute; groups. He gave evidence at the trial of Jean-Paul Marat and was called to give evidence at the trial of the Dantonists on their connections with the English whigs, though the defence witnesses were not heard. With other enemy aliens Perry was arrested in August 1793 and gaoled for fourteen months. He believed he was lucky to have escaped execution and on his release in late 1794 he remained in Paris for a further five months. He returned clandestinely to Britain in early 1795 but was betrayed to the authorities and arrested on the charges of 1792. He was imprisoned in Newgate until the change of ministry in 1801. There he detailed his persecution by the government in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Oppression!!! The Appeal of Captain Perry &hellip; to the People of England</span>, published in 1795. That year he wrote his most substantial work, <span class="italic">An Historical Sketch of the French Revolution</span>, published in two volumes in 1796. Perry relaunched <span class="italic">The Argus</span> as a magazine in early 1796, and in the same year published <span class="italic">The Argus &hellip; a Political Miscellany</span>; the following year he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Origin of Government, Compatible with, and Founded on the Rights of Man</span>, in which he set out the objectives of the LCS. He had come close to death with gaol fever in 1796, and on his release in 1801 he wrote for a variety of radical periodicals. Around 1809 Perry became joint proprietor of <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, an independent newspaper, which he made more radical. He was forced to sell his interest in the paper about 1812 because of the cost of cross-suits for libel, in 1811, with Lewis Goldsmith, editor of the <span class="italic">Anti-Gallican Monitor</span>.<br>
<br>Perry's first wife, details of whom are unknown, died in 1813 and later he married again. He continued to publish radical articles but was declared an insolvent debtor. He probably died in prison on 4 July 1823, of a ruptured artery, apparently just before he was to be released. His property was seized but his third wife, Barbara, and seven children were supported by a public subscription raised by a group of Perry's old radical friends.<br>
