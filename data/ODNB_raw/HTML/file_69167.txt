<span class="headword">Fleming,  Alice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Alice Fitzgerald]</span>, Lady Slane  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1508, <em>d.</em> in or after 1540), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534)")</script>, chief governor of Ireland, and his first wife, Elizabeth Zouche (<i>d</i>. 1517). She was apparently the second of four daughters and a son&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9586/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, known as Silken Thomas")</script>, the future tenth earl. She also had two half-brothers&#151;the elder of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald")</script>, later became eleventh earl of Kildare&#151;and three half-sisters, the children of her father's second marriage, to Elizabeth Grey, following her mother's death in 1517. She was raised in the earl's lavishly furnished castle of Maynooth. Successive earls of Kildare all had large families, and some of her kinswomen also proved adept politicians, notably her aunts Margaret, countess of Ormond, and Eleanor, wife of MacCarthy Reagh and then <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20556/', "Manus O'Donnell")</script>, who harboured the future eleventh earl after the Kildare rebellion. Kildare practice was generally to marry their younger sons into the lordship's other leading families; but their daughters, including Alice's younger sisters, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20510/', "Brian O'Connor")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66269/', "Ferganainm O'Carroll")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66268/', "O'Carroll, Mulroney")</script>] respectively, were frequently matched with Gaelic chiefs to strengthen the family's influence in Gaelic Ireland.<br>
<br>Lady Alice Fitzgerald married her cousin James Fleming, ninth Baron Slane (1507/8&#150;1573), son of Christopher Fleming, eighth Baron Slane, and her aunt Elizabeth Fitzgerald, probably in 1527 or 1528. James was nine when his father died in August 1517, and in January 1523 Kildare obtained his wardship from Henry VIII. Alice accompanied her father to court in December 1526, and they later stayed at the duke of Norfolk's house at Newington. Before his departure from Ireland, Kildare had arranged with his leading officials and advisers to use Alice as a &#145;prevy token&#146; to indicate to them how well he was faring in the council's inquiries into his conduct as deputy. Accordingly, when Lady Slane, as she then was, arrived home without her father in August 1528, they knew the earl &#145;was not at his pleasour to come home&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 60/1, fol. 139). Allegedly, Kildare ordered her to procure his brothers and servants, O'Neill and O'Connor, to stir up war against the new deputy, the earl of Ossory; and &#145;upon hir arryvall, sche rod streth home to OConour is house, and had longe secrete comynycation&#146; with her brother-in-law  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 2.147). Immediately thereafter O'Connor recommenced raids on the Englishry, and the earl's brother Sir Thomas Fitzgerald of Leixlip, captain in his absence, put up no resistance &#145;by reason of certain intelligence had with O'Conoghour, contrary to his allegiance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Ormond Deeds</span>, 1509&#150;47, no. 144). In the inquiries which followed, Lady Slane, together with the earl's steward, Sir Walter Delahide, and his wife, was commonly reputed the chief instigator of &#145;O'Connor's wars&#146;. The king pardoned her of all treasons and conspiracies with Irish rebels in June 1529, but when the earl was posthumously attainted of treason by the Irish parliament in May 1536 for his role in the 1534&#150;5 rebellion, the attainder took effect from 8 July 1528&#151;the date on which he had dispatched Alice back home.<br>
<br>Neither Lady Slane nor her husband played a major role in the 1534&#150;5 revolt, and so escaped attainder. Her date of death is not known, although she was still alive in May 1540, when granted the joint wardship of the future tenth Lord Slane. A Lady Slane was living in July 1561.<br>
