<span class="headword">Brooks,  James</span>  (1825&#150;1901), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Hatford, Berkshire, on 30 March 1825, the son of John Brooks, a farmer from Hatford who later moved to Wantage, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tyrrell. He was educated at Abingdon School, where he showed a precocious interest in agricultural technology, inventing a threshing machine and a new type of ploughshare which became commercially successful. In 1847 he went into the London office of the architect Lewis Stride. He attended T. L. Donaldson's lectures at University College, and in 1849 he enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools. In 1853 he opened his own office at 5 Bloomsbury Square and over the ensuing years he designed several houses and schools in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. He married Emma (1821/2&#150;1892), daughter of J. Martin of Sandford House, Sandford-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, probably in 1858, and his first son was born in the following year; two more sons and a daughter followed. In 1862 he and his family settled at The Grange, Clissold Crescent, Stoke Newington, London, a red-brick Gothic house built to his own designs.<br>
<br>Brooks's place in the history of architecture derives largely from his London churches. He was a zealous high-churchman and obtained his most significant commissions from like-minded Anglicans, some of whom were fellow worshippers at St Matthias's, Stoke Newington, where he served as churchwarden from 1868 to 1879. His first important church, St Michael's, Mark Street (1863&#150;5), was in the desperately poor parish of Shoreditch in the East End, and he went on to design two more churches in the neighbouring district of Haggerston: St Columba's, Kingsland Road (1868&#150;9), and St Chad's, Nichols Square (1868&#150;9). Other commissions soon followed: St Saviour's, Hoxton (1865&#150;6; dem.), St Andrew's, Plaistow (1867&#150;70), and The Annunciation, Chislehurst (1868&#150;70). With their wide, lofty naves, narrow aisles, raised chancels, and lancet or plate-traceried windows, these noble and beautifully proportioned buildings epitomize the mid-Victorian ideal of the Anglican town church. They were built relatively cheaply, usually of brick, and their unembellished interiors and bulky exteriors have something of the gravity of early Cistercian architecture. Brooks also designed the parsonages and elementary schools which clustered around most of the churches, and in 1870&#150;73 he designed a convent for Anglican nuns next to St Michael's, Shoreditch; its daughter house of St Mary of Nazareth, Edgware, was begun to his designs in 1875, though, like many of his buildings, it was never finished.<br>
<br>There was something of a hiatus in Brooks's career in the 1870s, but in the last twenty years of his life he became one of the most prolific of English church architects. At St John's, Holland Road, Kensington (1872&#150;1910), The Ascension, Lavender Hill, Battersea (1876&#150;98), Holy Innocents', Hammersmith (1887&#150;1901), St Peter and St Paul, Dover (1891&#150;3), and All Hallows, Gospel Oak (1892&#150;1901; completed by Giles Gilbert Scott, 1913&#150;15), and in his competition designs for Liverpool Cathedral (1887; unexecuted), he developed and refined the French-inspired early Gothic style of his earlier churches long after it had gone out of fashion among his younger contemporaries. Except at St Mary's, Hornsey (1888&#150;9), and one or two other churches, he showed little interest in English late Gothic, and his secular buildings, apart from schools and parsonages, are few in number and of negligible interest.<br>
<br>Though less well known than some of his contemporaries, Brooks was one of the most accomplished architects of the Gothic revival. He became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1866, honorary consulting architect to the Incorporated Church Building Society in 1880, and diocesan architect for Canterbury in 1888. In 1881 he joined the RIBA council, became vice-president in 1892, and was awarded the RIBA gold medal in 1895. In 1875 he moved his office to 33&#150;5 Wellington Street, Strand, and in 1892 he took his son and pupil James Martin Brooks into partnership. He took only two other pupils, George Godsall and Alfred Mackmurdo, and of these only Mackmurdo&#151;who set up practice on his own in 1875&#151;made a significant impact on architecture. Though living in London all his professional life, Brooks retained an enthusiasm for rural pursuits, riding to hounds until the age of fifty and shooting until he was sixty. His wife died on 31 August 1892 and on 24 January 1894 he married his housekeeper, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1866/7), daughter of John Spicer, forester: something which, if his family were to be believed, cost him a knighthood. He died of heart failure at his home, The Grange, Clissold Crescent, Stoke Newington, on 7 October 1901 and was buried three days later in Great Northern London cemetery, Southgate. His son then took over the architectural practice in partnership with George Godsall, and when he died on 24 October 1903 his place was taken by John Standen Adkins, who completed some of Brooks's unfinished buildings.<br>
