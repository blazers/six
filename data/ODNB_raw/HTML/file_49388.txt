<span class="headword">Goddard,  Charles</span>  (1769/70&#150;1848), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Westminster, the son of Charles Goddard, though rumour attributed his paternity to Charles Lloyd, secretary to Lord Grenville. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in November 1787 aged seventeen. He left Oxford in the summer of 1789 without taking a degree. In August 1789 he was appointed to a clerkship in the Home Office, which he held until October 1794, and he became personal secretary and pr&eacute;cis writer to Grenville, the home secretary. When Grenville was foreign secretary, Goddard, as the minister's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, was made collector and transmitter of state papers in that department, with a salary of &pound;500, and subsequently received a pension of &pound;850 a year when he relinquished the office. He served as a midshipman at the battle of Trafalgar, was later a prisoner in France, and was freed through the influence of Charles James Fox.<br>
<br>About 1813 Goddard was ordained and served for seven years as curate of Hitcham, Buckinghamshire, where Joseph Goodall, the headmaster of Eton College, was rector. As a curate he established district committees at High Wycombe and Aylesbury of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK), and supported the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the Incorporated Church Building Society. In 1814 Sir George Pretyman-Tomline, the bishop of Lincoln, made him prebendary of Louth in Lincoln Cathedral, and further promoted him to the archdeaconry of Lincoln (1817). He was additionally presented by Bishop Howley of London to the rectory of St James Garlickhythe, London, in 1821. In that year he received an Oxford MA by decree and proceeded BD and DD. He delivered the Bampton lectures at Oxford in 1823, later published as <span class="italic">The Mental Condition Necessary to a due Inquiry into Religious Evidence</span> (1824). Although a pluralist (see J. Wade, <span class="italic">The Extraordinary Black Book</span>, 1832, 107) who owed his advancement to the notorious nepotist Pretyman-Tomline, he was a conscientious clergyman associated with the Hackney Phalanx, the reformist circle of traditional high-churchmen.<br>
<br>Goddard was an energetic archdeacon. Between 1817 and 1822 he visited about 400 of the 516 parishes in his archdeaconry. His visitations were rigorous. At Leake in 1820 he ordered all the bells to be rung to test their soundness, causing the parish clerk to comment, &#145;Archdeacon you call him. I think he is the Archdevil&#146;  (letter from Dr Parkinson of Ravendale; Binnall, 158&#150;9). Where he found a dilapidated church he required the churchwardens to summon a vestry to levy a rate to pay for repairs. If they refused he threatened legal action. He encouraged the establishment of clerical lending libraries at each visitation centre in his archdeaconry, conducted on the basis of the rules for such libraries drawn up by Thomas Bray, one of the founders of the SPCK. On financial grounds he ceased to undertake further routine visitations in 1827; his archdeaconry was worth only &pound;30 a year and his prebend &pound;14.<br>
<br>Goddard worked closely with John Kaye, bishop of Lincoln from 1827. He urged Kaye to reintroduce rural deans into the diocese and recommended as candidates competent, locally respected, resident incumbents whose ecclesiastical opinions conformed to his own. He saw non-residence as the great evil in the church, although he recognized pluralism as an economic necessity for many clergy. In his 1833 charge to the clergy in his archdeaconry he admitted the need to augment benefice incomes, and in his 1836 charge supported the ecclesiastical commissioners' policy, which he had previously opposed, of diverting cathedral endowments to this purpose, acknowledging parliament's moral right to redistribute endowments intended for public objects. But he criticized the <span class="roman">Church Discipline Bill</span> of 1839 for interfering with bishops' spiritual jurisdiction, and opposed proposals for government inspection of church schools.<br>
<br>In 1844 Goddard resigned the archdeaconry and accepted the subdeanery of Lincoln Cathedral in order to allow the establishment of a new canonry under the <span class="roman">Dean and Chapter Act</span> (1840) linked to the archdeaconry and thus provide an adequate income for future archdeacons. In 1836 he had exchanged his London rectory for that of Ibstock, Leicestershire. He died at Ibstock on 21 January 1848 aged seventy-eight and was buried there. He had intended that his charges, beginning with the second (published in 1819), should provide his clergy with a manual of ecclesiastical discipline and clerical duty, but he did not complete the task.<br>
