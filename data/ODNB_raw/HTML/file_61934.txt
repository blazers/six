<span class="headword">Hawkes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hopkins; <em>other married name </em>Priestley]</span>,  (Jessie) Jacquetta</span>  (1910&#150;1996), <span class="occ">archaeologist and writer</span>, was born on 5 August 1910 in Cambridge, the younger daughter and third and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33977/', "Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1861&#150;1947)")</script>, biochemist and Nobel prize winner, and his wife, Jessie Ann (1869&#150;1956), daughter of Edward William Stevens, ship's fitter, of Ramsgate. Her eminent father was a distant cousin of the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. In her imaginative writing style she was to embrace both academic exactness and poetic form, producing work that was ahead of its time in its lyrical synthesis of science and art; she would argue that the two were inseparable. In the range of her published work&#151;poetry, plays, journalism, fiction, biography, popular guide books, and academic papers&#151;she communicated, at all levels, her passion for archaeology, and the response of people, and places, to change over time. In a childhood essay she declared that passion. She was already inspired by visits to museums with her mother, and the discovery that her own home, at 71 Grange Road, Cambridge, was built where a Roman road overlapped an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. She attended the Perse School for Girls (1921&#150;8) and then went to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1929, the first woman to read archaeology and anthropology for the new undergraduate degree. In her second year she took part in her first proper excavation, a Roman site near Colchester, and met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51094/', "(Charles Francis) Christopher Hawkes (1905&#150;1992)")</script>, a young and already brilliant archaeologist, whose proposal of marriage she preferred over several others.<br>
<br>Privately surprised at gaining a first, Jacquetta went on to excavate at Mount Carmel in Palestine with Dorothy Garrod. Her work there, unearthing a Neanderthal skeleton, moved her to poetry. On 7 October 1933 she married Hawkes in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, her father's college. It appeared a blissful union of mutual interests, but some fifty years later, recalling the Majorcan honeymoon in her partly autobiographical <span class="italic">A Quest of Love</span> (1980), Jacquetta wrote simply and revealingly: &#145;We enjoyed the sun and visiting antiquities&#151;and were not unhappy&#146;  (Hawkes, <span class="italic">Quest of Love</span>, 212). Her only child, Nicolas, was born in 1937, and from a marriage at that time &#145;admirably well-balanced and free&#146;  (ibid.), the pair also produced a book together, <span class="italic">Prehistoric Britain</span> (1943), largely written by her. They set up home in London, most notably at 39 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill, the back garden of which featured in Jacquetta Hawkes's most acclaimed work, <span class="italic">A Land</span> (1951). This fusion of geology, archaeology, literature, and art, illustrated by her friend Henry Moore, was hailed for its Donne-ish lyricism. It was a considerable departure from her other solo publications, the second volume of the <span class="italic">Archaeology of the Channel Islands</span> (1938), on Jersey, and <span class="italic">Early Britain</span> (1945), and its unique appreciation of the past, and the problems of the dawning nuclear age, set its author apart as an archaeologist not shy of offering up a new perspective. Her literary interests also found a place in her private life, in an affair with the Australian poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36589/', "Walter Turner")</script>. Jacquetta Hawkes's only volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Symbols and Speculations</span> (1949), was a response to Turner's early and sudden death in 1946. During the war she had also become involved in an affair with a woman which, although platonic, left her emotionally confused.<br>
<br>Christopher Hawkes's work for the British Museum was successful but all-demanding, and the couple's increasingly separate lifestyles and interests were exacerbated by his wartime employment as a principal in the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Finding her niche as a consummate communicator, Jacquetta also joined the civil service in 1941, working on post-war reconstruction, and for the Ministry of Education from 1943. In her role as editor-in-chief of its film unit she produced <span class="italic">The Beginning of History</span>, which was a novel attempt at presenting prehistory, then thought unfilmable, in a new format, with an Iron Age site reconstructed at Pinewood Studios. In 1943 she was also made principal and secretary of the UK national commission for UNESCO, and protested vigorously against the inclusion of the playwright and author, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31565/', "John Boynton Priestley (1894&#150;1984)")</script>, on the grounds that he was not of sufficiently high literary calibre. She only admitted later that she had not read his books. Her objection was overruled, Priestley and Jacquetta met, and at a conference in Mexico City in 1947 began an affair which she held to be the great love of her life and which ultimately led to two much publicized divorces. In July 1953 the couple were married. They lived at the Albany in London, and at Brook Hill on the Isle of Wight, and moved to Kissing Tree House at Alveston, near Stratford upon Avon, in 1960.<br>
<br>Jacquetta Hawkes gave up the civil service in 1949 to concentrate on writing. As well as producing archaeology books she collaborated with Priestley on two plays, one of which, <span class="italic">A Dragon's Mouth</span> (1952), was experimental but well received, as was <span class="italic">Journey Down a Rainbow</span> (1955), a series of letters based on their travels in south-west America, dedicated to Carl Jung, to whose works Priestley introduced Jacquetta. Marriage with Priestley was deeply and mutually satisfying, as Jacquetta often pronounced, but she did not neglect her other passion. Her post-war role as archaeology adviser to the Festival of Britain gave her a stage for her own sweeping view of the history of Britain, and in 1952 she was made an OBE. In subsequent years she travelled widely as a correspondent for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, and maintained a high profile. She wrestled with the hugely ambitious UNESCO project <span class="italic">The History of Mankind</span>, as co-editor of the prehistory volume, and provoked debate with her 1971 John Danz lecture, delivered in Seattle, in which she urged that science should be complemented by intuition. This was published as <span class="italic">Nothing But or Something More</span>. In 1950 she became a governor of the British Film Institute and was instrumental, with Priestley and their great friends Canon John Collins and his wife, Diana, in the founding of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&#151;being distinguished at the front of the Aldermaston march by her stature and large hat. In 1971 she was made vice-president of the Council for British Archaeology, and in 1982 produced a biography of her close friend and fellow archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler. Her last publication was the <span class="italic">Shell Guide to British Archaeology</span>, published in 1986.<br>
<br>After Priestley's death in 1984, Jacquetta Hawkes, who firmly believed that death was the end, moved to Littlecote in the Cotswold town of Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. She remained a trustee of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, and continued her interests in church architecture and ornithology, as well as in such issues as homosexual law reform and education; she was a governor of two grammar schools. She died in Cheltenham on 18 March 1996, and was cremated on 25 March at Warwickshire crematorium, near Chipping Campden. Her ashes were interred near the resting place of J. B. Priestley at Hubberholme, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Her death left archaeology bereft of one of its most enigmatic personalities, whose personal life overshadowed her response to a rapidly evolving discipline, as it oscillated between science and humanities. Her life presented a veritable Minoan labyrinth of apparently contradictory paths: she championed Robert Graves's &#145;mother goddess&#146; theories, but spoke against the champions of women's liberation; she demanded respect as an academic, but courted disaster by the sexual frankness of <span class="italic">A Quest of Love</span>. Some never forgave her for breaking up Christopher Hawkes's family life (as noted by Vincent Brome, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 20 March 1996). Jacquetta Hawkes strove to achieve the Jungian balance; she was a unique woman who, if often haughty and aloof, was also, to those who knew her well, both compassionate and passionate&#151;&#145;a mixture of Athena and Aphrodite&#146;, as Diana Collins contended  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 20 March 1996). As Priestley famously remarked on first meeting her: &#145;What a woman! Ice without, fire within!&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
