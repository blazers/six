<span class="headword">Cox, Sir  Geoffrey Sandford</span>  (1910&#150;2008), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcasting executive</span>, was born on 7 April 1910 at Palmerston North, New Zealand, the youngest of three sons of Charles William Sandford Cox (1873&#150;1965), bank manager, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacGregor (1875&#150;1960). From Southlands High School in Invercargill he went to Otago University to read history and thence, as a Rhodes scholar, to Oriel College, Oxford, where he opted for philosophy, politics, and economics. More relevant to his immediate future was his travel in Europe during the vacations and, challenged by a German fellow scholar to see the Nazi way of life for himself, he spent three weeks under canvas with the <i>Arbeitsdienst</i>, the military-style youth labour service. An account he wrote of this adventure was picked up by the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> and in Britain by <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and brought him to the attention of Fleet Street.<br>
<br>After graduating from Oxford with a second-class degree in 1934&#151;and on 25 May 1935 marrying a young woman he had met there, Cecily Barbara Talbot Turner (1912&#150;1993), daughter of Alexander Forrest Turner, artist&#151;he was taken on by the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, a liberal newspaper with a tradition of forthright reporting. In Spain, where civil war broke out in 1936, its celebrated foreign correspondent Arthur Koestler had been imprisoned for criticizing General Franco. The veteran Vernon Bartlett was about to be sent in his stead when it was decided not to risk losing another of the paper's eminences. Despite his recent marriage Cox was considered more expendable, with the added advantage that his New Zealand passport might confuse suspicious fascists. In the event his coverage was confined to the beleaguered capital, and gave him the material for a book, <span class="italic">The Defence of Madrid</span> (1937), that brought him a rival Fleet Street offer, this time from the all-powerful <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, as a foreign correspondent. Based in Vienna, then Paris, but sooner or later pursuing every lurch towards world war, he covered the <i>Anschluss</i> of Austria into the German Reich, the Munich crisis, the Russo-Finnish winter war, the blitzkrieg through the low countries, and so to the fall of France, from where he escaped on the last P &amp; O steamer to leave Bordeaux.<br>
<br>Deciding it was time to fight in the war rather than report it, in 1940 Cox joined a New Zealand infantry brigade that had been switched to Britain when an immediate invasion was feared, but now that Mussolini's declaration of war had extended the conflict to the Mediterranean, was returning to its original destination, the Middle East. Cox served in Greece, Crete, and the western desert as an intelligence officer and was mentioned in dispatches. At this point his native country decided it should have a voice in the deliberations of the wartime alliances. Cox was plucked from the army and sent to the newly established New Zealand legation in Washington as first secretary and charg&eacute; d'affaires. His superior there was still a minister in the New Zealand government and had to spend much time back home. It fell to Cox, aged thirty-two, to debate and eventually sign historic treaties, on one occasion immediately ahead of the Soviet Union's formidable ambassador to the United States, Andrei Gromyko. Then in 1944 he was able to rejoin what was now the 2nd New Zealand division for the final slog of the Italian campaign, from Monte Cassino to Trieste, which enclave staged the first of the many vengeful small wars that flared up once the big war ended, and gave Cox another subject for a book.<br>
<br>Spurning a diplomatic or military career, in 1945 Cox went back to the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> as a lobby correspondent but was soon making his name as a commentator on international as well as domestic affairs. When the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> made him an assistant editor in 1954 he determined on an executive career in newspapers. Two years later he was offered the deputy editorship. His letter of acceptance was in his pocket, ready to be delivered, when he heard the snatch of gossip which&#151;once more&#151;tempted him to change course. Aidan Crawley, who had successfully set up Independent Television's news service, ITN, when commercial television went on the air in 1955, was sick of the cost-cutting and general interference now emanating from hard-hit programme contractors, and was resigning in protest. Cox stalled on the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> offer and applied for the ITN job. He was summoned to lunch by Captain Tom Brownrigg, the brusque former naval officer who was general manager of Associated-Rediffusion, the main London contractor, and also chairman of ITN. They had been reluctant allies, they now discovered, when in 1941 German airborne forces were landing on Crete and the navy was dispatched to take off British and New Zealand troops. &#145;Would have left you there if I'd had my way&#146;, Brownrigg grunted. &#145;We had already lost half the Mediterranean Fleet. It was madness to risk losing more ships&#146;  (<span class="italic">See it Happen</span>, 21&#150;22).<br>
<br>Nevertheless Brownrigg gave Cox the post of editor, ITN. It was a daunting challenge. Crawley's great innovation had been to replace the impersonal newsreaders of BBC television with &#145;newscasters,&#146; as he termed them, who would be involved in the writing and delivery of each item, and who might even turn to interview a witness to the story or a specialist in its subject. The public's favourite was the athlete Christopher Chataway. Only now did Cox learn that he too was quitting. There happened to be an approach from the then little-known Ludovic Kennedy, whose Sunday afternoon arts programme had just been axed, while young Robin Day was showing promise. Cox, whose knack of picking the right people for the right job would distinguish his whole career, pushed them both to the forefront.<br>
<br>On a visit to the United States Cox had been impressed by the authority of such news moguls as Charles Collingwood and Ed Murrow, and even more by their live transmission of events and debates and hearings as they took place, notably Murrow's showing-up of Senator McCarthy. &#145;See it happen&#146; became his watchword (and in due course the title of his memoir). When President Kennedy arrived in London in 1961 his namesake Ludovic collared him in the street for an on-air interview. Another time viewers were abruptly switched to cameras deep under the Alps for the moment when engineers driving a new road tunnel from both ends met in the middle. All this enterprise was still confined within fifteen-minute bulletins out of peak viewing hours. Cox's goal was a full half-hour timed to harvest all the main news of the day. In 1967 he was finally able to launch <span class="italic">News at Ten</span>, the first half-hour, peak-time news programme or British television.<br>
<br>Cox (who was made a CBE in 1959 and knighted in 1966) was a member of a consortium bidding for one of the last programme contracts, Yorkshire TV. When in 1968 they succeeded he became its deputy chairman and had to leave ITN. In 1971 Yorkshire Television took over Tyne Tees Television, and Cox become chairman of the latter. In 1977, however, he returned to his old haunts as chairman of UPITN, an international agency formed by ITN and United Press. He was also chairman of LBC Radio from 1978 to 1981.<br>
<br>Cox finally retired in 1981 to enjoy country walks and fishing in local waters, though he also served as an independent director of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> for another eight years. He and Cecily had had two sons, Peter and Patrick, and twin daughters, Rosamond and Evelyn. Their home from 1976 was in Coln St Dennis, Gloucestershire. Cox, who survived his wife by fifteen years, died on 2 April 2008, at Moreton Hill Farm Care Centre, Standish, Gloucestershire, of cancer. He was cremated at Cheltenham crematorium on 11 April and his ashes, along with his wife's, rest in the burial annexe of St James the Great Church in Coln St Dennis. They were survived by their four children.<br>
