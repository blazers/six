<span class="headword">Phipps,  Joseph</span>  (1708&#150;1787), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, the son of Joseph and Elizabeth Phipps, was born at York and was brought up as a member of the Society of Friends. He was apprenticed to a shoemaker in London but, on account of his extravagant lifestyle, was often driven to &#145;the necessity of eating his paste till he could finish a pair of shoes&#146;  (&#145;The conversion of Joseph Phipps&#146;). In later years he became a coal merchant. While in London he took great pleasure in theatre-going and wrote a play, which came into the hands of the duke of Richmond; he was subsequently offered &pound;100 for the copyright. Phipps was induced by a pious fellow apprentice to go to a Friends' meeting at the Savoy. Under the guidance of Benjamin Kidd, a Quaker minister, Phipps was converted and shortly thereafter rescued his play from the press.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1753 Phipps accompanied Ann Mercy Bell, a Quaker minister of York, on a street-preaching tour of London, which he recalled in <span class="italic">A summary account of an extraordinary visit to this metropolis in the year 1753 by the ministry of Ann Mercy Bell</span> (1754). His written work, produced between 1754 and 1782, mainly consists of tracts in defence of the Quakers, and replies to Samuel Newton of Norwich, who had attacked them. Among his most notable productions are: <span class="italic">Observations on a late anonymous publication [by Samuel Newton] intituled A letter to the author [James Beezley] of a letter to Dr Formey &amp;c.</span> (1767); <span class="italic">Brief remarks on the common arguments now used in support of divers ecclesiastical impositions in this nation, especially as they relate to dissenters</span> (1769); <span class="italic">The Original and Present State of Man</span> (in answer to Samuel Newton) (1773); a further <span class="italic">Reply to a late publication by S. Newton of Norwich, intituled An appendix &amp;c. in answer to which it is plainly shewn that the Quakers are not Calvinists</span> (1774); and <span class="italic">A few reflections occasioned by the injurious treatment of the people called Quakers, on account of their nonconformity to public fasts and festivals [etc.]</span> (1799). Phipps also edited <span class="italic">The Journal of George Fox</span> in 1765.<br>
<br>In 1760 Phipps married Sarah Kendall of Norwich, with whom he had a son, who died in infancy, and three daughters. In 1766 he moved to Norwich, where he died on 14 April 1787 and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground. Friends wrote that Phipps excelled &#145;as a clear writer and reasoner. In controversy he avoids calumny, and devotes himself to the statement of evident truth. He is in the great succession of leaders, Robert Barclay, Jonathan Dymond and Caroline Stephen&#146;  (&#145;Dictionary of Quaker biography&#146;).<br>
