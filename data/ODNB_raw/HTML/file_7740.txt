<span class="headword">Dodd,  Ralph</span>  (1756?&#150;1822), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was probably born in 1756 in South or North Shields, one of three known sons of Alexander Dodd. After some education in practical mechanics he studied at the Royal Academy for about five years, and in the 1780s, like his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7741/', "Robert Dodd")</script>, attempted to make a living from painting. He married Fanny Lambert on 16 February 1778; she and their three sons and a daughter survived him. His earliest connection with engineering was the trial of an excavating machine on the Grand Junction Canal near Hayes in 1794. The same year he carried out a survey of the River Wear, and a succession of reports followed relating to canals and harbours in the north-east. His short historical <span class="italic">Account of the Principal Canals in the Known World</span> (1795) was largely plagiarized from J. Phillips's <span class="italic">General History of Inland Navigation</span> (1792). He then promoted tunnels beneath the Tyne and the Thames from Gravesend to Tilbury. Work began on the latter in 1799 but was abandoned in 1802. In 1798 he proposed to construct the Thames and Medway Canal, from near Gravesend to Strood, which was eventually completed by W. T. Clark. In 1799 he published <span class="italic">Letters on the Improvement of the Port of London without Making Wet Docks</span>, and became involved with proposals for a new London bridge. In 1804 he turned his attention to the water supply of London, and became involved in the establishment of the South London, West Middlesex, East London, and Kent waterworks companies. As with almost all of his proposals, Dodd's active involvement with these schemes was short-lived.<br>
<br>Dodd's sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7735/', "George Dodd")</script> and Barrodall Robert assisted him in many of his schemes, including the Grand Surrey Canal, from which they were all dismissed in 1802. They all became heavily involved in the development of steam navigation. Dodd was involved in the initial plans for Vauxhall Bridge, and almost certainly assisted George in his proposals for Waterloo Bridge.<br>
<br>In 1815 Dodd issued his <span class="italic">Practical Observations on the Dry Rot in Timber</span>. The same year he took out a patent with George Stephenson for a steam locomotive. He then began advocating iron bridges &#145;of tenacity&#146;, and built one over the Chelmer at Springfield (1819&#150;20). In April 1822 Dodd was injured by the bursting of a steam vessel at Gloucester. He was advised to go to Cheltenham for his health and, with virtually no money, had to walk there. He died there on 11 April 1822.<br>
