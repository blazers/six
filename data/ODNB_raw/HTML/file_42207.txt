<span class="headword">Cocks,  William Alfred</span>  (1892&#150;1971), <span class="occ">clockmaker and bagpipe scholar</span>, was born on 8 October 1892 at St Mary's Terrace, Ryton, co. Durham, the son of John Cocks, banker's clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth Cummings, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dunlop. As a small boy he conceived what proved to be a lifelong interest in the pipes after being given a toy set as a present. He worked as a master watch- and clockmaker but in his leisure became an expert craftsman and skilled player of the bagpipes. Over the years he made many fine sets of Northumbrian small pipes, taking pride in doing everything himself, down to sewing the bags and bellows. From the time of the First World War onwards, he travelled the country in search of instruments made by others. The important collection which he gradually acquired is now held at the Chantry Bagpipe Museum, Morpeth, Northumberland, on loan from the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>As a pioneer member of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, Will Cocks provided a set of pipes as a trophy in the annual Newcastle Musical Tournament. As a leading expert on the instrument he was a member (later fellow) of the Society of Antiquaries (Scotland) and an honorary member of the Galpin Society. He contributed bagpipe articles to <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1954 edn) and wrote for Oxford University Press a <span class="italic">Tutor for the Northumberland Half-Long Bagpipe</span> (1925). In 1931 he produced, with Gilbert Askew, a revised edition of J. W. Fenwick's <span class="italic">Instruction Book for the Northumbrian Small-Pipes</span>, which had originally appeared in 1896. In his later years he renovated many old sets of pipes and also conducted extensive experiments in the use of new materials and methods of working. His book <span class="italic">The Northumbrian Bagpipes</span> (1967), jointly written with J. F. Bryan, is the definitive work on the construction of the instrument.<br>
<br>Cocks died at Hexham General Hospital on 31 March 1971 as a result of an accidental overdose of barbiturates; the inquest recorded a verdict of misadventure. Photographs show him as tall, slim, dark-haired, and moustached, yet he remained a bachelor throughout his long life, which he single-mindedly devoted to a passion for the sweet-sounding pipes of his native region. In <span class="italic">Bagpipes</span> Anthony Baines paid tribute to Cocks's &#145;vast store of knowledge and material&#146;, and assessed him as being &#145;one of the bagpipe's leading historians&#146;  (Baines, 14).<br>
