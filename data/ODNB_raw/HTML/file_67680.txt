<span class="headword">Buckle,  (James) Desmond</span>  (1910&#150;1964), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was born on 29 March 1910 in Accra, capital of the British colony of the Gold Coast, in west Africa. He was the second of five children born to Vidal James Buckle, a prominent and wealthy lawyer, and his wife, Ellen Konadu Buckle, a member of the equally prominent Bannerman family. The Buckle family originated from Sierra Leone and Desmond Buckle's forebears were of African-American and Caribbean origin. Desmond first came to Britain as a child at the age of ten, shortly after the death of his father, and was educated at Truro College in Cornwall, and in 1928 began medical studies at University College, London. He failed to complete his medical studies and in the early 1930s became increasingly active in several student and black political organizations, including the League of Coloured Peoples, the Gold Coast Students' Association, of which he was secretary from 1936 to 1937 and president from 1937 to 1938, and the communist-led Negro Welfare Association.<br>
<br>During the late 1930s Buckle became the first west African and almost certainly the first African to join the Communist Party of Great Britain, and by 1943 was a member of the party's colonial committee. He subsequently worked in the party's international affairs and Africa committees, and from 1950 to 1954 was editor of the latter committee's <span class="italic">Africa Newsletter</span>. He was a regular contributor to such publications as <span class="italic">World News and Views</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, and <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span>. It was Desmond Buckle who presented the report on Africa and the West Indies to the conference of communist parties of the British empire in London in 1947.<br>
<br>Buckle was also involved with the work of the National Council for Civil Liberties and spoke at several of the organization's conferences both on the anti-colonial struggles in Africa and on the problem of racism and the colour bar in Britain. In 1945 he drafted <span class="italic">Manifesto on Africa in the Post-War World</span>, which British-based African and pan-African organizations sent to the newly formed United Nations and which among other things called for &#145;full self government within a definite time limit&#146; for all the African colonies.<br>
<br>After 1945 Buckle was active in the international peace and trade union movements. He represented the Transvaal Council of Non-European Trade Unions at the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Paris in 1945. He was subsequently a member of the general council of the federation, and he played a leading role in the work of the preparatory committee of the All-African Trade Union Congress which met in Dakar, Senegal, in 1951. He was also a member of the permanent committee of the World Peace Congress, and was elected to the presidium of the Second World Peace Congress, held in Warsaw in 1950.<br>
<br>During the post-war period Buckle was employed as a journalist by TASS, the Soviet news agency, reporting mainly on sport and African affairs. He also wrote for several European papers including the German publications <span class="italic">T&auml;gliche Rundschau</span>, <span class="italic">Neue Berliner Illustrierte</span>, and <span class="italic">Zeit im Bild</span>. A committed internationalist, he even acted as Paul Robeson's secretary during his four-month stay in Britain in 1949. Desmond Buckle was a regular speaker at meetings and conferences throughout Europe and one of the founders of the British-Hungarian Friendship Society. He died of stomach cancer at St George's Hospital in London on Sunday 25 October 1964, and his ashes were interred at Highgate cemetery, Middlesex, on 31 October.<br>
