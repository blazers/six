<span class="headword">Williams,  Griffith</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gutyn Peris]</span>  (1769&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was born at Hafod Olau in the parish of Llanbeblig, Caernarvonshire, on 2 February 1769, the only son of William Williams and his wife, Catrin, daughter of Morgan Gruffydd (Morgan y Gogrwr) of Ll&#375;n. Not long after his birth, the family moved to Llwyn Celyn, Llanberis; his father died soon afterwards, and when Williams had attended school for only a year, he was forced to seek employment as a farm hand. After serving in various farms at Anglesey, he found work in 1790 at Lord Penrhyn's quarry, and henceforward followed for thirty years the occupation of a quarryman, holding subordinate offices as he grew older. Early on in his work at Penrhyn he broke his ankle, and during a nine-month period of enforced convalescence was lent books and learned the rules of Welsh prosody. He married, on 21 June 1794, Elizabeth, daughter of Ellis Jones, and in a few years moved to her home at Braich Talog, Llandyg&aacute;i, Caernarvonshire, where he spent the rest of his life.<br>
<br>As Gutyn Peris he won his first triumph as a bard in 1803, when the Gwyneddigion Society awarded him their medal for his ode to the memory of Goronwy Owen. In 1808 he composed for Lady Penrhyn a Welsh elegy upon her husband; two years later he was the winner at St Asaph eisteddfod of prizes for an ode on the royal jubilee and another to the memory of Queen Elizabeth. Some of his poems were printed by David Thomas (Dafydd Ddu Eryri) in <span class="italic">Corph y gainc</span> (1810), and in 1816 Williams published a volume of Welsh verse himself, entitled <span class="italic">Ffrwyth awen</span>. In 1811 he again won a prize for an ode to agriculture. During the rest of his life he was less successful, coming second at the eisteddfod at Denbigh in 1828 (although his ode was printed with the winner's in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the competition, 1830), and in 1832 at Beaumaris he also took the second place. His knowledge of the Welsh metres was thorough, but he had few of the gifts of a poet. Griffith Williams died on 18 September 1838, and was buried at Llandyg&aacute;i.<br>
