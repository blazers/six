<span class="headword">Byrne, Sir  Edmund Widdrington</span>  (1844&#150;1904), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Islington, London, on 30 June 1844, the eldest son of Edmund Byrne of Whitehall Place, Westminster, solicitor, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cowell. He was educated at King's College, London, before entering as student at Lincoln's Inn on 5 November 1863. He was a pupil in the chambers of George Osborne Morgan and was called to the bar on 26 January 1867. His family's connections with solicitors gave him a large practice as a conveyancer and equity draftsman, while his powers of clear and concise statement in court put him among the leading juniors of the Chancery bar. On 13 August 1874 he married Henrietta Johnstone, daughter of James Gulland of Newton, of Wemyss, Fife; they had several children.<br>
<br>Byrne became queen's counsel in 1888 and a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1892. He attached himself to the court of Mr Justice Chitty where he and Robert Romer QC soon shared most of the work between them. A well-grounded lawyer and pleasant speaker, Byrne was an admirable leader in routine Chancery cases. He was at his best as advocate in a court of first instance. His appearances in the higher tribunals were rare, except in the Court of Appeal in cases in which he had appeared at earlier hearings.<br>
<br>In July 1892 Byrne won a parliamentary seat, the Walthamstow division of Essex, as a Conservative candidate. The <span class="roman">Finance Act</span> of 1894 and the abortive <span class="roman">Employers' Liability Bill</span> of 1895 gave him the opportunity to make many legally minded interventions in debate. Byrne quickly adapted to parliamentary life and he was referred to in the press as one of &#145;the busy bees&#146;. In July 1895 he was again returned for Walthamstow with a largely increased majority.<br>
<br>On the promotion of Chitty to lord justice, Byrne was given the vacant judgeship in the Chancery Division (18 January 1897), and was duly knighted. On the bench he was painstaking, courteous, and patient, and his judgments, which included many patent cases, were nearly always affirmed upon appeal. Contemporary colleagues thought him overly scrupulous, however, and judged him too slow, morbidly conscientious, and reliant on authority, being particularly irritated by his falling behind in his cases.<br>
<br>Byrne died after a very short illness on 4 April 1904 at his home, 33 Lancaster Gate, Hyde Park, London. He was buried at Brookwood cemetery.<br>
