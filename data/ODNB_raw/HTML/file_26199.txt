<span class="headword">Stackhouse,  Thomas</span>  (1756&#150;1836), <span class="occ">educational writer and antiquary</span>, was born at Cockermouth on 27 September 1756, the son of Daniel Stackhouse and Margaret Morland, who married in 1755, and the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26197/', "Thomas Stackhouse (1681/2&#150;1752)")</script>, vicar of Beenham Valence. He was educated by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26198/', "Thomas Stackhouse (1706&#150;1784)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26197/', "Stackhouse, Thomas (1681/&#150;1752)")</script>] in London and worked as a tutor in Liverpool. He published a number of school textbooks on punctuation, ancient Greek society, geography, astronomy, and the use of globes, many of which were illustrated with his own drawings and diagrams. He also wrote a few theological works. His principal hobby was investigating the archaeological remains of early Britons. After walking &#145;considerably above a hundred miles &hellip; among the barrows&#146; near Weymouth and Dorchester, in Dorset, he published <span class="italic">Illustration of the Tumili, or Ancient Barrows</span> (1806). He lectured on his antiquarian interests, published as <span class="italic">Two Lectures on the Remains of Ancient Pagan Britain</span>; <span class="italic">Copies of drawings illustrative of a course of lectures on the architectural and other remains of Britain</span> appeared in 1833. He was elected a member of the Royal Liverpool Academy, founded in 1810.<br>
<br>On 18 December 1783, at Liverpool, Stackhouse married Ruth (1756/7&#150;1833), daughter of John and Ruth Fell of Blennerhasset, Cumberland. They had three sons&#151;Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1785), John (<i>b</i>. 1792), and Joseph (1795&#150;1808)&#151;and two daughters, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1787) and Mary (1789&#150;1790). Their two elder children were born in Lancashire, the three younger in London, which suggests that the family moved to London between 1787 and 1789. In later life Stackhouse joined the Society of Friends. His speech at the eleventh annual meeting of the Peace Society was reported in the <span class="italic">Herald of Peace</span> (vol. 6, 1827). His wife died at Stamford Hill on 16 February 1833, aged seventy-six. He himself died at Chapel Road, Birdcage Fields, Hackney, on 29 January 1836, and was buried, with his wife, in the Quaker burial-ground at Park Street, Stoke Newington, on 4 February. He left in manuscript &#145;Historical, doctrinal, and literary notices of the Society of Friends&#146; but its whereabouts is unknown.<br>
