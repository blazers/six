<span class="headword">Warren, Sir  Charles</span>  (1798&#150;1866), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Bangor on 27 October 1798, was the third son of John Warren (1766&#150;1838), dean of Bangor, who was nephew of John Warren, bishop of Bangor. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Crooke MD, of Preston, Lancashire. The mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28778/', "John Warren")</script> was an elder brother. He entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, but, being offered by the duke of York a commission in the infantry, he was gazetted ensign in the 30th foot on 24 November 1814, and joined the depot at Colchester on 24 January 1815. He commanded a detachment from Ostend in the march of the duke of Wellington's army to Paris after Waterloo, and entered Paris with the allied army.<br>
<br>In January 1816 Warren embarked for India, and served at Fort St George, Madras, until his return to England in the summer of 1819. He was promoted lieutenant on 13 November 1818. On 17 August 1820 he transferred to the 55th foot. In December 1821 he embarked with his regiment for the Cape of Good Hope, was promoted captain by purchase on 1 August 1822, commanded a detachment of two companies on the Cape frontier from November 1824 to the end of 1825, and returned to England in 1827. During his service at the Cape he rode from Cape Town to Grahamstown, and, among other expeditions into the interior, he journeyed across the Orange and Vaal rivers to Sitlahoo with Mr Glegg of the Madras civil service, who published an account of it at the time. Warren visited the Griqua and BaRolong chiefs and Robert Moffat's mission station near Kuruman. Extracts from his journals were printed in the <span class="italic">Royal Engineers Journal</span> in June and July 1884. His notes and sketches were made use of by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36753/', "Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Warren")</script> of the Royal Engineers, when reporting on the Bechuana and the Griqua territories fifty years later, in 1876.<br>
<br>Warren married on 17 April 1830, and, with his wife, Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 20 Jan 1846), daughter of William Hughes of Dublin and his wife, Margaret, embarked for India. He served at Fort St George, Madras, until the end of 1831, when he marched to Tunamalli and Bellary in command of a wing of the regiment. He commanded the 55th in the expedition against the raja of Coorg in April 1834 and was severely wounded. He was promoted major on 21 November 1834, sent to Vellore in 1835 and to Sikandarabad in 1836, and returned to England with his family in 1838.<br>
<br>On 26 June 1841 Warren sailed for China in command of a detachment; he arrived at Hong Kong in November, fought in the war of 1842, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 23 December 1842, and the following day was made a companion in the Order of the Bath. He also received the war medal. After his return to England in August 1844, Warren was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel to command the 55th regiment on 25 November 1845, and served with it in Ireland during the famine in 1846&#150;7. In March 1851 he accompanied it to Gibraltar, where he served until May 1854, when he took it to Turkey and the Crimea. He commanded the regiment (which formed part of the 1st brigade, 2nd division), was wounded at the battle of the Alma, and was mentioned in dispatches. He commanded his brigade at Inkerman in November 1854, and was again wounded and mentioned in dispatches. He by now had a considerable reputation for bravery, publicly recognized by Lord Raglan, the commander-in-chief in the Crimea.<br>
<br>Warren was sent to Scutari and then on sick leave, until he was sufficiently recovered to return to the Crimea on 12 July 1855; on the 30th he resumed command of the 1st brigade, 2nd division, and served continuously in the trenches until the fall of Sevastopol, again being wounded. In February 1856 he was given the command of an independent brigade, composed of the 11th hussars, the siege-train, and four battalions of infantry, which he held until June, and in July he returned to England. For his Crimean services he received the medal with clasps for Alma, Inkerman, and Sevastopol, the reward for distinguished military service, the fourth class of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, the third class of the Mejidiye, and the Turkish and Sardinian medals.<br>
<br>On 8 August 1856 Warren was appointed to command a brigade at Malta with the temporary rank of major-general. On 26 October 1858 he was promoted major-general on the establishment of the army. He remained at Malta for five years, and, in the absence of the governor, acted for some time as governor and commander of the forces. He was made a knight commander in the Order of the Bath, military division, on 19 April 1865.<br>
<br>Charles and Mary Warren had six children, two of whom died young. Warren got married again on 4 October 1859, this time to Mary (<i>d</i>. 22 Dec 1860), daughter of George Bethell, rector of Worplesden and vice-provost of Eton College. There were no children from the second marriage. Warren's eldest son, John, served with him in the Crimea, dying of wounds at Scutari. His second son, Charles (aforementioned), had a varied and distinguished military career. Warren died at Monkstown, near Dublin, on 27 October 1866.<br>
<br>Warren had a natural ability for science and mathematics. His memory was so good that he could retain in his mind all the figures of a long calculation, and could correct and alter those figures at will. He was also a good draughtsman. He occupied his leisure time during the later years of his life in perfecting an instrument which he had invented for the graphic solution of astronomical problems for nautical purposes, and which he had brought to the notice of the Admiralty in 1845. The instrument was for the purpose of approximately determining the latitude from two observations taken before 9 a.m. and at noon, and also of finding the latitude by a south altitude, from the time of day, and of finding the amplitude and azimuth. The invention was considered ingenious, and its principle correct; but its adoption was not recommended for the Royal Navy, in case this induced neglect of even the slight acquaintance with nautical astronomy which officers were then required to possess.<br>
