<span class="headword">Kipling,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1745, <em>d.</em> 1822), <span class="occ">dean of Peterborough</span>, born at Bowes, Yorkshire, was the son of William Kipling, a cattle salesman, and Margaret, his wife. He was baptized at Bowes on 20 October 1745. He received his early education at Scorton and Sedbergh schools, and was admitted a sizar of St John's College, Cambridge, on 28 June 1764. He graduated BA in 1768, and proceeded MA in 1771, BD in 1779, and DD in 1784. He was ordained deacon on 29 May 1768 and priest on 10 June 1770. He was admitted as a fellow of St John's in 1769, removed on a mandate of the bishop of Ely, as visitor, and readmitted in 1771. In 1773 he was elected one of the taxors of the university. In 1782 he was elected Lady Margaret's preacher, on the resignation of Dr Richard Farmer. In 1787 he was appointed deputy regius professor of divinity, as the professor, Dr Richard Watson, was in ill health. In 1792 he preached the Boyle lectures, but, as was often the case, these were not published. In 1784 he became vicar of Holme-on-Spalding Moor in Yorkshire, a living, in the gift of his college, which he held until his death. In 1798 he was appointed dean of Peterborough and rector of Fiskerton in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>In 1778 Kipling published a work on optics which Gunning accurately described as &#145;little read and soon forgotten&#146;  (Gunning, 2.49). His major publication was the <span class="italic">Codex Theodori Bezae Cantabrigiensis, evangelia et apostolorum acta complectens, quadratis literis, Graeco-Latinus</span> (1793), printed at the Cambridge University press. The impression was limited to 250 copies. This edition of the <span class="roman">Codex Bezae</span> was a splendid specimen of typography, the types resembling the uncial characters of the original manuscript, and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> described it as &#145;a facsimile edition&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Critic</span>, Feb 1794, 140). This work was, however, marred by a Latin preface which Kipling wrote, littered with linguistic errors for which he was gently reprimanded by his few friends and savagely lampooned by his many enemies. Dr Thomas Edwards described it as &#145;disgraceful to a literary society&#146; and coined the term &#145;a Kiplingism&#146; to mean a grammatical error  (Edwards, iv, 28). This term was repeated with glee in the humorous undergraduate handbook <span class="italic">Gradus ad Cantabrigiam</span> (1824, 64&#150;5). Gunning suggests that Kipling was something of a laughing stock in the university as a pretentious eccentric, but he was also cantankerous and vindictive. He engaged in three major controversies. In 1793 he played a leading part in the prosecution of William Frend of Jesus College for his Unitarian views. Although he was an inefficient prosecutor, by his conduct and manner &#145;he rendered himself obnoxious to an independent party in the University&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>, 449). In 1802 his <span class="italic">The Articles of the Church of England Proved not to be Calvinistic</span> attacked his opponents so bitterly that a Calvinist critic justly reflected, &#145;a controversial writer must be strangely blinded by passion &hellip; or puffed up with a vain conceit of his own superiority who flatters himself that his notions cannot be opposed without dishonest intentions&#146;  (Academicus, 1). In 1809 he turned on the Roman Catholics. Some Irish Catholics had reprinted Thomas Ward's 1688 <span class="italic">Errata of the Protestant Bible</span> and Kipling denounced them in <span class="italic">Certain accusations brought recently by Irish papists against British and Irish protestants of every denomination</span> (1809), insisting that Linus, not St Peter, was the first bishop of Rome  (p. 66). In 1815 he attacked the Roman Catholic John Lingard's <span class="italic">Strictures</span> on Herbert Marsh's <span class="italic">Comparative View of the Churches of England and Rome</span>, first threatening him with prosecution for using the term &#145;modern church of England&#146;, but later withdrawing.<br>
<br>Kipling's unpopularity at Cambridge was evidenced by his failure in elections for the rectory of Bedale, Yorkshire, in 1775 and for the Lady Margaret professor of divinity in 1788. A contemporary obituary suggested his appointment as dean of Peterborough in 1798 was &#145;as a reward for his political services and as some consolation for the mortifications he had experienced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>, 449). Thomas Kipling died on 28 January 1822 at the vicarage of Holme-on-Spalding Moor. He never married.<br>
