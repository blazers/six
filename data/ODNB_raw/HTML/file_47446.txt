<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  Walter</span>, first baronet  (1826&#150;1910), <span class="occ">civil engineer and publisher</span>, was born on 17 August 1826 in The Wheatsheaf inn, Abbey Town, Cumberland, the second of six children of Samuel Scott (1791&#150;1833), innkeeper and farmer, and his wife Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (<i>d</i>. 1877). Walter's parents were poor and after his father died, when Walter was seven years old, his education was minimal. At fourteen he was apprenticed to a mason and then found work on the Caledonian Railway. Railway work took him to Newcastle upon Tyne where in 1849 he established his own business as a builder and contractor. He specialized in large-scale contracts, mainly railway and dock construction. On 17 November 1853 he married Ann Brough (1825&#150;1890), the daughter of John Brough, a husbandman. They had six children.<br>
<br>Scott was engaged to build a printing factory for the Tyne Publishing Company, but the business failed in January 1882. Although Scott had no experience of printing or publishing, in August he appears to have taken over the business in lieu of payment for the factory. He appointed David Gordon, a bookbinder already working for Tyne Publishing, as general manager. Gordon was an excellent choice and gradually extended the publication programme. Tyne's list (mostly giftbooks, but also including a few biographies, a <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and miscellaneous titles) was kept in print, and a series of reprints of standard texts was introduced. Then came a series of selected editions, the <span class="roman">Canterbury Poets</span>, and the <span class="roman">Camelot</span> series of prose works with Ernest Rhys as general editor. Original publications followed, including works by Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats, and George Moore. The first English translations of Ibsen began to appear in 1888.<br>
<br>Building and contracting continued, with railway work still the mainstay. Scott built the first &#145;tube&#146; underground railway in London, opened on 4 November 1890 by Albert Edward, prince of Wales. The line ran from King William Street under the Thames to Stockwell. His business interests widened and before he died he had a seat on boards of at least eighteen companies including steelworks, coalmines, and shipyards. His first wife having died in 1890, on 11 January 1892 he married a widow, Helen Meikle (<i>c</i>.1850&#150;1923), the daughter of John Dykes, a farmer. Scott was a Conservative councillor in Newcastle from 1881 to 1890 and a JP for Northumberland. He was made a baronet in the king's birthday honours of 1907. He died on holiday at H&ocirc;tel du Cap Martin, Menton, France, on 8 April 1910 and was buried in Menton on 11 April. He left just over &pound;1,424,000, one of only fifteen truly self-made millionaires in Britain before 1939.<br>
