<span class="headword">Cornwallis, Sir  William, the younger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1579&#150;1614), <span class="occ">essayist</span>, was probably born in Fincham, Norfolk, eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6337/', "Sir Charles Cornwallis (c.1555&#150;1629)")</script>, diplomat and court official, and his first wife, Anne Nicholls (<i>bap</i>. 1551, <i>d</i>. 1584), daughter of Thomas Fincham of Norfolk. An unconfirmed report suggests that he studied at Queen's College, Oxford. He married Katherine Parker (1582?&#150;1634) on 26 August 1595; they had eleven children. Serving in the earl of Essex's Irish campaign, he was knighted on 5 August 1599. Whether or not he was involved in Essex's rebellion, he lived quietly for the rest of Queen Elizabeth's reign and was for a time in Edinburgh, where he introduced Sir Thomas Overbury to Robert Carr. Confusion of Cornwallis with his uncle, Sir William the elder (<i>c</i>.1551&#150;1611), father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68036/', "Anne Cornwallis")</script>, has made nonsense even of recent discussions of his work, attributing to him his uncle's greater age, retired life, and friendship with Ben Jonson. In 1600 and 1601 he published two volumes of familiar <span class="italic">Essayes</span>. About 1600 he began writing paradoxical essays, some published posthumously as <span class="italic">Essayes, or Rather, Encomions</span> (1616) and <span class="italic">Essayes of Certaine Paradoxes</span> (1617). Among the latter is his encomium of Richard III, dedicated in an extant manuscript to John Donne. Other works include a verse epistle to Donne, an elegy on the death of Prince Henry, and <span class="italic">Discourses upon Seneca the Tragedian</span>.<br>
<br>Cornwallis writes as a gentleman amateur on such subjects as ambition, resolution, youth, essays and books, and humility. His tone is meditative, his style fluent but discursive, his periods short and balanced. Illustrative examples are drawn from his own experience, though with evident modesty. He is concerned with self-improvement, particularly for statesmen, stressing stoic virtues such as resolution, fortitude, and endurance. His method is influenced by Montaigne, his ethics by Seneca. The paradoxes range from satirical praise of misfortunes (the French pox, debt) to what seem at least partly serious defences of historical figures (Julian the Apostate, Richard III). The essay on Richard III is the first extant attempt at a defence of that king. There have been suggestions (Zeeveld; Kincaid and Ramsden), based on the changes in the manuscript versions, that Cornwallis was adapter rather than author of this work. Though limited to excusing Richard for reason of state rather than disproving the accusations against him, it influenced later defenders, beginning with Sir George Buck.<br>
<br>On James I's accession in 1603, Cornwallis became a member of the king's privy chamber. He won favourable notice from the earls of Northampton and Salisbury and from Sir Henry Wotton, and they tried to persuade his father&#151;who complained of Cornwallis's extravagance&#151;to support him more liberally. In 1605 he carried dispatches to England from Spain, where his father was resident ambassador. Sir William was MP for Orford, Suffolk, in 1604 and 1614. During the earlier tenure he spoke in parliament supporting the union of England and Scotland. He received a gift of &pound;2000 from the king in 1612, but when he died in the summer of 1614 his widow complained that she and their eight surviving children had been left destitute. He was buried on 1 July in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London.<br>
<br>Cornwallis vies, with Sir Francis Bacon, for the distinction of being the first familiar essayist in English and, with his friend John Donne, for that of being the first English paradoxical essayist. In each case it is impossible to tell who wrote first. He was a pioneer in using Montaigne. Popular in his own time, he is rarely noticed now, obscured by his more famous and older contemporaries. However, the essay tradition, as it re-emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is nearer to Cornwallis's method than it is to Bacon's.<br>
