<span class="headword">Senhouse, Sir  Humphrey Fleming</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1781, <em>d.</em> 1841), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born in Barbados and baptized there on 6 June 1781, was the third son of Lieutenant William Senhouse RN (1741&#150;1800), surveyor-general of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Samson Wood, speaker of the Barbados assembly. His grandfather Humphrey Senhouse of Netherhall, Cumberland, had married Mary, daughter and coheir of Sir George Fleming, bishop of Carlisle.<br>
<br>Senhouse entered the navy in January 1797 on the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey, in the West Indies. In November 1797 he was moved into the brig <i>Requin</i>, in which he first came to England towards the close of 1799. From March 1800 to April 1802 he served in the <i>Fisgard</i> under Captain Thomas Byam Martin and Captain Michael Seymour. On 9 April 1802 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Galgo</i>, and in May 1803 was appointed to the <i>Conqueror</i> (Captain Thomas Louis). With Israel Pellew, who relieved Louis in April 1804, he served in the Mediterranean, in the voyage to the West Indies, and in the battle of Trafalgar, until January 1806. He then went out to the West Indies in the <i>Elephant</i>, was put on board the <i>Northumberland</i>, flagship of Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane, and in September 1806 was appointed to command the <i>Express</i> on the Spanish main and among the Leeward Islands until March 1808, when he joined the <i>Belleisle</i> as flag lieutenant to Cochrane. In July of that year he was sent home by Cochrane with dispatches. On 26 January 1809 he rejoined the admiral, now in the <i>Neptune</i>, and served through the capture of Martinique. For this, on 7 March, he was promoted to the <i>Wolverene</i>, commanding it, and afterwards the <i>Ringdove</i> and <i>Sup&eacute;rieure</i>, in the West Indies until December. In 1810 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Vice-Admiral John Manley; they had two daughters. In 1810&#150;12 he commanded the brig-sloop <i>Recruit</i> (18 guns) at Gibraltar, Newfoundland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia; and in 1812&#150;14 the <i>Martin</i> (18 guns) on the Halifax station, serving with distinction in the Anglo-American War.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1814 Senhouse was advanced to post rank, and from April to September 1815 commanded the <i>Superb</i> (74 guns), on the coast of France, as flag captain to Sir Henry Hotham. He was again with Hotham in the Mediterranean, as flag captain in the <i>St Vincent</i> (120 guns), which he commanded from 1831 to 1834. On 13 April 1832 he was made a KCH, and he was knighted again on 5 June 1834. In April 1839 he commissioned the <i>Blenheim</i> (72 guns), which he took out to China; he died on the ship on 14 June 1841, of fever contracted by fatigue and exposure during the operations at Canton (Guangzhou). He was buried at Macau. Fifteen days after his death he was nominated a CB.<br>
