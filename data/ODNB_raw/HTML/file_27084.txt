<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas</span>  (1617/18&#150;1682), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, was born at Carlton near Skipton in Craven, on the borders of Yorkshire and Westmorland, probably the son of Thomas Taylor of Ravenstonedale, Westmorland. Like his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27022/', "Christopher Taylor")</script> he was educated at Oxford and became a clergyman before eventually moving to Quakerism. He was licensed to preach and became lecturer at Richmond, Yorkshire, after which he was curate of the chapel of Preston Patrick in Westmorland, and preached in neighbouring places. A strong puritan, he moved well beyond godly orthodoxy and refused to baptize his own children, and in 1650 held a conference or disputation on baptism with three neighbouring ministers in Kendal church. He also refused to receive maintenance from tithes and gradually came to minister to separatists at Preston Patrick, taking only what they were willing to provide. The chapel there became the focus of a Seeker community.<br>
<br>In 1652 Taylor went at Judge Fell's invitation to meet George Fox at Swarthmoor Hall. In reply to Fox's questioning he owned that he had never been called to preach as the apostles had been. Fox noted in his journal that Taylor was convinced about this time and accompanied him into Westmorland, where at Crosscrake chapel he was moved to speak of his state prior to conversion. Although he had a wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1682), and five or six children, Taylor resigned his benefice and &#145;travelled up and down in many parts of England, preaching the word of the Lord, and his gospel freely&#146;  (Fox, &#145;Testimony&#146;). His itinerant work took him to south Lancashire, the midlands, and Yorkshire. Once when returning to Richmond:<blockquote>he was made to go there, and turn his back to the priest, and put his hands to both his ears and stop them, as a sign, how God had stopped his ears unto their sacrifice, and service, and offering. (ibid.)</blockquote>In September 1653 Taylor was taken prisoner at Appleby for speaking in the church. He was released in 1655 but was again in Appleby gaol, possibly in 1656 (though this may well be confused with an earlier or later imprisonment) and certainly from August 1657 to August 1658 after he refused to pay the fine of 5 marks imposed on him for abusing Francis Higginson, the fiercely anti-Quaker vicar of Kirkby Stephen, when the latter was preaching at Appleby. Taylor had shouted at him, &#145;Come down, lyar, for thou speakes contrary to the doctrin of Christ, for Christ hath said, sweare not at all&#146;  (Raine, 79). He was also imprisoned at York, Richmond, Leicester, Worcester, and Coventry. At the Stafford assizes in 1662 he incurred a sentence of <i>praemunire</i> for refusing to swear the oaths of allegiance, and was imprisoned for more than ten years. His wife hired a house nearby where he was sometimes allowed to go to be with his family. He was also permitted to write books and teach children, but was not released until the general pardon granted by Charles II in March 1672. In 1679 he was fined &pound;20 for preaching to two or three friends in a house in Keele and was again imprisoned in Stafford gaol. He died from a &#145;distemper&#146; at Stafford on 18 March 1682 in his sixty-fifth year; his wife, Elizabeth, died the following December. He was buried in Stafford on 21 March.<br>
<br>Taylor was a man of some learning and a great admirer of Jakob Boehme. He wrote prolifically and his collected works, entitled <span class="italic">Truth's Innocency and Simplicity</span> (1697), contains numerous addresses, warnings, and exhortations. Many of these are short testimonies against sports and amusements such as bear- and bull-baiting, maypoles, bells, bonfires, and lotteries, which Taylor believed to be cruel, or a waste of valuable time, and heathen in origin. Some of his longer tracts are also of interest, such as <span class="italic">Ignorance and Error Refuted</span> (1662) which is an answer to the arguments of the ejected minister of Wolverhampton, John Reynolds, and outlines the Quaker position on various issues, for example the sufficiency of the inner light and the role of scripture in Friends' thought. He attacked Richard Baxter's <span class="italic">The Cure of Church-Divisions</span>, describing the author as &#145;a Man who (through a shew of Learning and Religion) had gotten in Oliver Cromwell's Days, a great Esteem in the Minds of the Ignorantly zealous professors of Religion in this Nation&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Truth's Innocency</span>, 201). Taylor in turn drew upon himself the fire of Lodowick Muggleton, who both attacked him in print and pronounced a curse upon him for the critical marginalia he had written in a Muggletonian book which he had been lent by a convert from Quakerism.<br>
<br>Taylor's collected works contain numerous valuable testimonies to his life, including those from his son Thomas and daughter Hannah, and that from his brother Christopher, who wrote of him, &#145;the course of his life was eminently exemplary, so grave, tender and humble he was, and self-denying&#146;  (C. Taylor, &#145;Testimony&#146;). A further testimony, from Robert Barrow, describes Thomas Taylor as &#145;comely &hellip; fair and ruddy&#146;  (Barrow, &#145;Testimony&#146;).<br>
