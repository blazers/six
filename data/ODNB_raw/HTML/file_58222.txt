<span class="headword">Carbutt <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Herford]</span>,  Louisa</span>  (1832&#150;1907), <span class="occ">schoolmistress and educational pioneer</span>, was born on 25 September 1832 at Altona, near Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of Francis Carbutt (1792&#150;1874) and his wife, Louise Petronella, daughter of George Henry Penecke of Copenhagen. Sir Edward Hamer Carbutt, first baronet (1838&#150;1905), an engineer, twice mayor of Leeds, and Liberal MP for Monmouth from 1880 to 1886, was her younger brother. Her father was a merchant who supported the Anti-Corn Law League and became mayor of Leeds in 1847. Originally a Quaker, he withdrew from the Society of Friends to become one of the Unitarian congregation of the Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds. On his death his property was distributed equally among his seven surviving sons and daughters.<br>
<br>Louisa Carbutt's parents believed in giving their daughters as good an education as they could afford for their sons, and she attended a boarding-school at Hamburg until 1847, acquiring a fluency in four languages. A trip to the USA at the age of twenty-five inspired her to seek an independent, unmarried vocation, earning her own living, and she left the parental home in Leeds in 1859 to become a teacher of German in the large boarding-school for girls, Rawdon House, Hertfordshire, run by Sarah Stickney Ellis. There she was disappointed at the limited intellectual horizons opened to the daughters of the middle classes; she herself studied astronomy and botany. Her reading of Friedrich Froebel's works inspired an interest in new educational methods, which was encouraged by W. B. Hodgson, professor of education at St Andrews University, who introduced her to the works of Herbert Spencer.<br>
<br>In 1860 Carbutt went to Knutsford, Cheshire, where two Unitarian families were seeking a governess for their daughters. She proposed, instead, to establish a school, taking both day-girls and boarders. Brook House opened in August 1860, taking girls aged between nine and fourteen. Although never a large school, Brook House was notable for its pioneering methods, principally the development of girls' intellectual, moral, and spiritual faculties without recourse to rewards or punishments. There was close companionship between teachers and pupils, who were allowed more freedom than was usual at that time. Much emphasis was laid on hygiene, fresh air, exercise, and wholesome diet. The curriculum, which was enlightened, included science teaching. Ill health caused Carbutt to give up the school in 1870 and she returned to Leeds where she was one of the first women to be elected a poor-law guardian. She was particularly concerned to promote the integration of pauper children, ensuring that they were educated with other children in ordinary board schools rather than segregated in workhouse schools. In 1884 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33835/', "William Henry Herford (1820&#150;1908)")</script>, who had taught at Brook House and shared her educational ideals. In 1886 they settled at Paignton, Devon, where their Unitarian beliefs shocked some of the more genteel residents. She died there, at Torbay Lodge, on 4 May 1907.<br>
