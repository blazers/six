</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watson,  Joshua</span>  (1771&#150;1855), <span class="occ">wine merchant and Anglican philanthropist</span>, was born on 9 May 1771 at Tower Hill, City of London, the second son of John Watson (<i>d</i>. 1821), a wine merchant of Tower Hill, and of Dorothy Robson, a cousin of the watercolour painter George Fennel Robson and sister of the Revd James Robson, master of Sherburn Hospital, co. Durham. He was educated, from the age of ten, under the private tuition of Mr Crawford at Newington Butts, and from thirteen to fifteen at a commercial school run by Mr Eaton in the City of London. He also attended schools at Bromfield and Maidstone. In 1786 he was taken into his father's counting-house, which at that time moved within the City of London from Tower Hill to Mincing Lane. In 1792, aged twenty-one, he was admitted as a partner in his father's business. In 1797 he married Mary Sikes (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of Thomas Sikes, a banker in Mansion House Street, City of London. Mary's uncle, Charles Daubeny (afterwards archdeacon of Sarum), and her brother, Thomas Sikes (1766&#150;1834), rector of Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, who had been at Oxford with Joshua's elder brother, the Revd John James Watson (1767&#150;1839), were among the most prominent churchmen of the day. Joshua and Mary Watson had two daughters; the first died unmarried, but the second, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1840), married Henry Michell Wagner (1792&#150;1870), vicar of Brighton (from 1824), in 1838.<h2>
<a name="TheHackneyPhalanx"></a>The Hackney Phalanx</h2>As a wine merchant Watson was part of the commercial world, but his heart was always in the church work to which as a young layman he dedicated his life. His early friends and advisers included notable high-churchmen of the preceding generation: William Stevens (1732&#150;1807), hosier, treasurer of Queen Anne's Bounty and founder of the Club of Nobody's Friends (1800), of which Watson was an original member; William Jones (1726&#150;1800), vicar of Nayland; Jonathan Boucher (1738&#150;1804), vicar of Epsom (where John James Watson served his first curacy); and Sir John Richardson (afterwards a judge in the court of common pleas). Joshua Watson formed close friendships with numerous like-minded contemporaries who formed the nucleus of the high-church coterie known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/52465', "Hackney Phalanx")</script>, so called from the residence of some of its members in that locality. Apart from Watson himself, the most prominent members of the Hackney Phalanx included: Henry Handley Norris (1771&#150;1850), perpetual curate (later rector) of South Hackney, with whom he maintained an unbroken friendship of nearly sixty years; William Van Mildert (1765&#150;1836), rector of St Mary le Bow, City of London (afterwards bishop of Llandaff and Durham); and Christopher Wordsworth (1774&#150;1846), master of Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>The two Watson brothers and Norris worked closely together in masterminding the various religious, educational, missionary, and philanthropic activities of the Hackney Phalanx. Watson and his friends responded to the need to provide elementary education on Christian principles in the industrial towns and to meet the challenge of the schools founded by Joseph Lancaster which rejected church control. In 1811 the National Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church was founded at a meeting at Watson's house in Clapton. Watson became the National Society's first treasurer, holding this office until his resignation in 1842. He was largely responsible for the raising of &pound;16,000 in subscriptions by May 1812. The appointment of the archbishop of Canterbury as president, and the other bishops as vice-presidents, ensured that the National Society conformed to Watson's model of the church acting in its corporate capacity and was not a mere private pressure group. The society encouraged parishes to open their own schools, but Watson insisted on instruction in the liturgy and catechism, attendance at church, and the use of no books except those published by SPCK before authorizing the payment of grants.<br>
<br>Watson supported various literary ventures on behalf of the church. Along with Norris and Van Mildert he published a literary series called <span class="roman">The Churchman's Remembrancer</span>, which appeared in three instalments between 1807 and 1810. At the end of 1811 Watson and Norris purchased the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, originally founded as an organ of Anglican orthodoxy in 1793 by Jones of Nayland, but which in subsequent years had somewhat diverged from its original character; after 1814 the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> once more became an effective mouthpiece of high-church principles. In 1818 Watson and Norris induced the Revd Frederick Iremonger to start another high-church periodical, the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>; there is evidence to suggest that they had a financial concern in the <span class="italic">Remembrancer</span> and were influential in appointing its editors.<h2>
<a name="AdministrativeworkforAnglicancauses"></a>Administrative work for Anglican causes</h2>In 1814 Watson retired from business in order to devote himself exclusively to charitable activities and to the service of the Church of England. His voluntary efforts were not deflected by the ridicule heaped upon him by his former friend William Cobbett, in a vitriolic attack in his <span class="italic">History of the Protestant Reformation</span> (1822). He was treasurer of the Clergy Orphan Society, a governor of the London Fever Hospital, and subscribed in all to fourteen societies, including the Philanthropic Society, founded with the aim of reforming juvenile criminals. He became secretary of the relief fund set up in 1814 for German refugees from the Napoleonic wars. On account of this charitable work he received presents from the kings of Prussia and Saxony, was granted a diploma of honour at the University of Hamburg, and was elected a member of the Hamburg Patriotic Society for the Encouragement of the Liberal and Useful Arts. Although he never personally crossed the English Channel, Watson assumed that the Anglican church throughout the world was his concern. For many years he held leading positions in both of the oldest church societies connected with missionary work, the SPCK and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG). In 1814 he was appointed joint treasurer of the SPCK and helped link the society more closely to the SPG. His financial ability and integrity were legendary. He transformed the SPG into an effective missionary society; its total annual income increased from just over &pound;8100 in 1814 to more than &pound;82,000 by the time of his death in 1855.<br>
<br>Watson also encouraged the bishops to take a more active interest in missionary work. His deep interest in the colonial churches and beginnings of what later became known as the Anglican communion was reflected in his role in the creation of new colonial bishoprics. It was at Watson's house in Westminster that &#145;was first fostered the good design of sending bishops to the British colonies&#146;  (Churton, 18&#150;19). Several of his intimate friends were appointed to these bishoprics: T. F. Middleton (Calcutta, 1822), John Inglis (Nova Scotia, 1832), William George Broughton (Australia, 1829), and George Selwyn (New Zealand, 1838). These bishops remained in regular correspondence with Watson, who offered practical advice and support. In 1841 he supported the foundation of the Colonial Bishoprics Fund, and in 1848 he became one of the founders and a member of the council of the new Missionary College of St Augustine, Canterbury. Watson's work for the overseas church was animated by his staunch high-church principles&#151;he was determined to support the building up of churches linked organically to the Church of England.<br>
<br>Watson was no less attentive to the practical concerns of the church at home. He was largely instrumental in the foundation and drawing up of the original resolutions of the Church Building Society in 1817. He became a member of the royal commission for church building set up under Lord Liverpool's government, managed expenditure of the &pound;1,500,000 parliamentary grant, and raised further large sums from voluntary sources over the next twenty years. In 1823 he took a house at 6 Park Street, Westminster, where he lived for the next sixteen years in order to be near the commission's headquarters. To aid the commission's revival of the church in industrial areas, the Church Pastoral Aid Society was founded in 1836. High-churchmen like Watson, however, objected to its evangelical ethos and use of lay assistants. In 1837, along with his friends Benjamin Harrison (1808&#150;1887), later archdeacon of Canterbury, and Sir Robert Inglis, MP for Oxford University, Watson founded the Additional Curates Society, pledged to work through the bishops and to respect ministerial order. Watson himself donated money and also acted as joint honorary treasurer.<br>
<br>In 1828 Watson played a prominent part in the Anglican foundation of King's College, London. This brought him into contact with a leading figure in the incipient Anglo-Catholic revival, Hugh James Rose (1795&#150;1838), with whom he became close friends. Watson opposed Roman Catholic emancipation on both religious and political grounds, and deplored the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. In 1833 he was instrumental in the drawing up of a lay declaration and in supporting a clerical address to the archbishop of Canterbury in defence of the embattled Church of England; an involvement which, through his link with Rose, first brought him to contact with the leading figures in the emergent Oxford Movement, Newman, Keble, Froude, and, later, Pusey. Watson's withdrawal from the ruling committee of the SPCK in 1833, however, marked the end of an era of Hackney ascendancy in the counsels of church and state, with the initiative in galvanizing opposition to the forces of liberalism and dissent passing to the younger Tractarians.<h2>
<a name="OrthodoxdivinityandtheTractarianmovement"></a>Orthodox divinity and the Tractarian movement</h2>Although nicknamed the Archtreasurer, Watson was no mere ecclesiastical and financial bureaucrat: through his exhaustive reading and study he could claim to be an accomplished lay theologian. His favourite divine was the eighteenth-century orthodox churchman Daniel Waterland (1683&#150;1740), and he was steeped in the high-church principles of the Caroline divines and later eighteenth-century high-churchmen. As a high-churchman Watson disapproved of both evangelicalism and the sort of latitudinarianism espoused by Thomas Arnold, as different but equally false manifestations of a &#145;Christianity of men above ordinances&#146;. He was implacable in opposition to protestant dissent and objected to the SPCK's sale of books written by nonconformists such as Isaac Watts and Philip Doddridge, and even Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span>. However, unlike some tory high-churchmen, he supported several evangelical-dominated moral and philanthropic ventures, such as William Wilberforce's Society for the Suppression of Vice. Watson came to be widely consulted on doctrinal as well as practical matters, and his learning as well as practical attainments were recognized by the University of Oxford when he was awarded an honorary DCL on 14 June 1820. When the Oxford Movement emerged after 1833, the eagerness with which individual Tractarians sought Watson's benediction for their efforts is testimony to the value which they placed upon his judgement.<br>
<br>Watson's relationship with the Oxford Movement was ambivalent. Like other members of the Hackney Phalanx he initially welcomed the Tractarians as allies in the cause of Anglican orthodoxy. Keble's <span class="italic">Christian Year</span> (1827) was one of his favourite works, and he delighted Newman by his &#145;munificent subscription&#146; to his new chapel at Littlemore in 1836. Watson warmly praised Newman's work advocating suffragan bishops in 1835, and had the highest regard for Newman's sermons. The evidence of Newman's published letters and diaries contradicts the assertion of Watson's biographer, Edward Churton, that Newman and Watson were never in the same room and that no correspondence passed between them.<br>
<br>Watson was happy to enlist Tractarian contributors to the ailing <span class="italic">British Critic</span> in 1836, and sympathized with Newman's objections to the liberal line being pursued by the then editor, J. S. Boone. He developed a sincere regard for some of the younger disciples of Newman in London, notably John William Bowden, James Robert Hope-Scott, and Samuel Francis Wood. In 1840 Watson handed over much of the business of the various church societies, which he had managed for over three decades, to Samuel Wood. He welcomed the energetic activities of Wood and other Tractarians on the council of the National Society who organized strong resistance to the government's proposals concerning lay state inspection of church schools in 1839. He was more committed than the Tractarians to establishment and the union of church and state, but was no less opposed than they were to state encroachment on the church's educational prerogatives.<br>
<br>Watson always hoped that Tractarian individualism might be curbed and harnessed by deference to the counsels of his own generation of high-churchmen, and at an early stage supported attempts to have the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span> submitted to the editorial supervision of a committee. In this he failed; Newman and Froude resisted such moves and jettisoned Hackney caution. Whereas the ideal of ecclesiastical action preferred by Watson was later derided by Newman as being that of &#145;a board of safe, sound, sensible men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Apologia pro vita sua</span>), the Oxford Movement represented a voyage of discovery for many of its followers. The publication of Hurrell Froude's iconoclastic <span class="italic">Remains</span> (1838), with its strictures on the English reformers and Reformation, was a source of private dismay for Watson. Newman's <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> (1841) and the increasingly &#145;romanizing&#146; character of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> heightened his private alarm over the apparent direction of the Oxford Movement. Watson deprecated the party spirit of the Tractarians, and compared Newman with the evangelical Charles Simeon as partisan leaders who equally strayed from the orthodox mainstream. He sympathized with most of the official academical and episcopal attempts to curb the Tractarians in the 1840s, such as the suspension of Pusey from preaching by the Oxford University authorities in 1843.<br>
<br>There were strict limits, however, to Watson's negative appraisal of Tractarianism: he was more reluctant than many of his Hackney friends, such as Norris, to make his profound misgivings public, and more ready than they to make allowances for what he regarded essentially as misplaced zeal and youthful excess. He assumed that Newman was being carried along unwillingly by his younger disciples, and restricted himself to private expressions of unease. He also supported the restatement of classical high Anglican principles enshrined in Christopher Wordsworth junior's (1807&#150;1885) <span class="italic">Theophilus Anglicanus</span> (1843), the proofs of which he helped to correct. Newman's conversion to Rome in 1845 came as a shock, but Watson remained convinced that the Oxford Movement represented gain as well as loss for the Church of England. His own generation of high-churchmen had concentrated on church policy and parliamentary manoeuvrings, but with the collapse of the old constitutional order in church and state Watson rightly sensed that the old high-church party needed the rejuvenating intellectual and religious force provided by Tractarian Oxford in order to respond to new challenges. He regretted the need to caution his younger Oxford friends and referred to himself as &#145;the wet blanket&#146;. Although his own sacramental views fell short of those propagated by the Tractarians, he welcomed Newman's attempt to recreate an Anglican form of semi-religious life at Littlemore based on retirement and self-denial.<br>
<br>The Tractarian leaders for long remained anxious to shelter under Watson's mantle. In September 1839 Watson and Pusey had an amicable interview at Brighton, after which Pusey told Newman that Watson's teaching was the same as their own, and that the older man linked them with past generations of high-churchmen. Most old high-churchmen of Watson's generation were more conscious of the discontinuities between the Tractarians and themselves, and Pusey may have exaggerated the extent of Watson's approval of Tractarian endeavours in order to gain credibility. Watson was clearly embarrassed by Tractarian attempts to link his name with the movement, and deprecated attempts to attach too much importance to &#145;the movement of 1833&#146;  (Webster, 29). He dealt, however, with the problem of Tractarian use of his name with characteristic delicacy and courtesy. In 1840 he gracefully declined Newman's offer to dedicate the fifth volume of his <span class="italic">Plain and Parochial Sermons</span> to himself. After much agonizing and apparent reluctance Newman went ahead anyway, making an unsanctioned and somewhat stilted dedication. Newman remained devoted to Watson's memory, being &#145;greatly struck with him&#146;  (W. Copeland to E. B. Pusey, 16 March 1855, Oxford, Pusey House, LBV).<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsandcharacter"></a>Later years and character</h2>In his last years Watson acted as a calming influence on more extreme high-churchmen, who were more troubled than himself by contemporary events. He counselled against a high-church overreaction to the Gorham judgment (1850), arguing that the verdict involved no new heresy, and did not touch or undermine the church's teaching on baptism as enshrined in her formularies. He deprecated the party spirit manifested by the formation of church unions. He was no less opposed to Arnoldian liberalism than were the Tractarians, but unlike the Tractarians pleaded for the toleration of differing opinions within the church so long as credal fundamentals were not endangered.<br>
<br>Although a city man and Londoner, Watson was an ardent Wordsworthian, with an intense love of nature. His piety was deep but unobtrusive; his favourite spiritual writer was Jeremy Taylor, in whose work he found a welcome scope for the imaginative faculty in devotion. Watson was too diffident to publish anything on his own account, but in 1825 he edited Hele's <span class="italic">Sacred Offices</span>, an eighteenth-century book of devotions based on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, which he regularly used. He also printed several selections from Jeremy Taylor's shorter devotional manuals. He was instrumental, in the pre-Tractarian era, in helping restore the print of the communion office in the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> to large, bold type.<br>
<br>Watson's later years were beset by domestic sorrows. His wife, Mary, died in 1831, and brother, Archdeacon Watson, in 1839. These losses, along with that of his daughter, Mary, in 1840, led him to sell his Westminster house in 1840 and to live during his remaining years with his late wife's sister and family at Clapton, and with his sister-in-law, Mrs J. J. Watson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Caroline Powell (1775&#150;1865), and her two daughters at Daventry. He also made regular visits to his friend the Revd Edward Churton (1800&#150;1874), his later biographer, at Crayke, near York.<br>
<br>A shy, reserved, and self-effacing man, Watson yet had a great gift for gaining and retaining friendships. His friends found him a conversationalist of wit and charm, never short of amusing stories and anecdotes, especially relating to his favourite author, Dr Samuel Johnson. He remained active until the end of his life. He died at Clapton on 30 January 1855 and was buried on 7 February in the family vault at Hackney.<br>
