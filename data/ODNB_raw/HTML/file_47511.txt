<span class="headword">Garnsey, Sir  Gilbert Francis</span>  (1883&#150;1932), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 21 March 1883, the fifth son of William Samuel Garnsey, a butcher in Wellington, Somerset, and his wife Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbings. He was educated locally at Wellington School, and his headmaster later recalled that Garnsey learned bookkeeping and had an uncanny way of getting very high marks in mathematics. He began to study for his accountancy qualifications during his final years at Wellington. The Revd E. C. Harries, the second master, introduced him to the Walsall firm of chartered accountants, Muras, Harries, and Higginson, where he became an articled clerk. Garnsey's intelligence and aptitude were revealed in 1903 when, at the age of twenty, he came first in the intermediate examination; he repeated this achievement two years later in his finals. Between 1902 and 1904, he played soccer for Aston Villa's second eleven as an amateur, though it is possible he was financially rewarded by the club, and used the money to pay for his articles.<br>
<br>Being of an ambitious disposition, Garnsey wrote to three of the leading accountancy firms in the City of London for a position. Price Waterhouse engaged him in 1905 at a salary of &pound;2 per week. Initially, he worked almost exclusively for Nicholas Waterhouse, the most recent admission to the partnership, and made an excellent impression. Waterhouse considered his investigation of Cornells, a Smithfield business seeking public flotation, masterly. Although only in his early twenties, Garnsey detected irregularities which resulted in a prolonged but successful litigation. Shortly after joining Price Waterhouse, Garnsey was sent to Paris to assist with an investigation of the New York Life Insurance Company, and his ability to work efficiently under pressure drew him to the attention of other partners.<br>
<br>Inexhaustible energy, combined with high intelligence and a natural skill for accountancy, resulted in Garnsey's being made a partner in 1913, aged thirty&#151;a remarkable achievement in an era when experience and family connections were valued. He had developed an uncanny skill with numbers and once observed: &#145;to me figures have always possessed individuality. I can remember a figure connected with an individual long after I may have forgotten his features and form&#146;  (obituary, <span class="italic">Evening News</span>). In the years before the First World War, Garnsey travelled extensively on the continent on audits and investigations for Price Waterhouse. In 1914 he volunteered for military service but was rejected on health grounds. In 1915 he married Miriam Howles BSc, daughter of John Howles, a cotton-mill manager; they had a son and a daughter. The following year he joined the finance department of the Ministry of Munitions in an honorary capacity and in 1917 was appointed director of internal audits and controller of munitions accounts. He eventually served as chairman of the finance committee and the finance member of the Munitions Council, and in June 1918 he was made a KBE for his war work.<br>
<br>While controller of munitions accounts, Garnsey met leading politicians, including Churchill, and had an opportunity to demonstrate his administrative and financial expertise to senior civil servants. As a result, he was in demand to serve upon government committees and investigations; in 1919 these included the Demobilization Board, the Munitions Council for the liquidation of contracts, the Ministry of Health committee on the government housing scheme, and the Treasury committee of inquiry into the accounts of aerodrome construction works. He was later a member of the Ministry of Health inquiry into the affairs of the Metropolitan Water Board (1920), the Lawrence committee on the administration of accounting for army expenditure (1922), and (in 1924) the Treasury committee on the accounting methods of government departments, the Board of Trade committee on the <span class="roman">Assurance Companies Acts</span>, and the court of inquiry into the remuneration of doctors under the <span class="roman">National Health Insurance Acts</span>. In 1925 he was appointed a member of the National Food Council, and in 1930 he served as chairman of the marketing and distribution consumable commodities committee of the Economic Advisory Council. He became chairman of the British industries fairs, sites, and buildings committee in 1931.<br>
<br>This public role reflected not only his own eminence, but the increasing significance of the accountancy profession. The network of connections that Garnsey had established led to Price Waterhouse being entrusted with a succession of special assignments. The companies with which the firm had close links included: Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company; Farrow's Bank; Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co.; Liptons; Cable and Wireless; Spillers' Milling and Associated Industries; and William Beardmore &amp; Co. Appointment as a company's auditor often followed intensive work on a prospectus or reorganization. As a result, Price Waterhouse flourished throughout the 1920s, generating sustained growth: its fee income rose from &pound;102,398 in 1918 to over &pound;300,000 by 1930, making it one of the largest practices in the UK.<br>
<br>Appreciating the limitations of the <span class="roman">Companies Acts</span>, Garnsey was one of the first accountants in Britain to call for reform of reporting procedures. In December 1922 he read a paper entitled &#145;Holding companies and their published accounts&#146; to the London members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, publishing the text in the same year. He recommended the presentation of &#145;a consolidated balance sheet of the whole undertaking amalgamating the assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries with those of the holding company and a consolidated profit and loss account embracing the profits and losses of all the companies&#146;  (Garnsey, <span class="italic">Holding Companies</span>, 1923, 10).<br>
<br>An exceptionally hard worker himself, Garnsey demanded the most of his assistants, whom he chose with care. He was also ambitious for Price Waterhouse and in 1929 put pressure on Sir Albert Wyon, the senior partner, to surrender some of his shares in the firm. Length of service governed the principle of succession and Garnsey had no immediate hope of executive authority. However, he continued to challenge Wyon and it was agreed that from 1 July 1932 the latter would retire to become a consultant and Garnsey would assume the senior partnership. Then on 26 June, five days before he was to take the post, Garnsey collapsed and died, aged forty-nine, of a pulmonary embolism, at Saint Hill House, his home at East Grinstead. A brilliant career was thus ended just when its greatest potential was about to be realized. Lengthy obituaries in the financial press and national newspapers nevertheless fittingly described him as a &#145;business doctor&#146;, a &#145;master of figures&#146;, and an &#145;unusual man of destiny&#146;. He was survived by his wife.<br>
