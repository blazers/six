<span class="headword">Barbon <span class="st"> [Barebone]</span>,  Praisegod</span>  (<em>c.</em>1598&#150;1679/80), <span class="occ">lay preacher and politician</span>, first appears in 1623, when he was made free of the Company of Leathersellers in London; having served an eight- or nine-year apprenticeship, he was probably then aged about twenty-five. At an unknown date, but probably by 1632, Barbon joined the semi-separatist congregation founded in 1616 by Henry Jacob, and later led by John Lathrop and then, from 1637, by Henry Jessey. On 18 May 1640 this church was divided &#145;by mutual consent&#146; with half of the original congregation following Jessey and the other half choosing Barbon. At this date Jessey is known to have been living in east London, in the liberty of the Tower, whereas Barbon's shop-cum-warehouse was outside the western wall of the city, so the division was probably a matter of geographical convenience.<br>
<br>By May 1632 Barbon had married Sarah, a member of Lathrop's church; they had at least one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1334/', "Nicholas Barbon (1637/1640&#150;1698/9)")</script>. Praisegod was clearly doing well in his trade, for he was elected a warden of the yeomanry of the leather-sellers in 1630, and a liveryman in 1634. His premises, at the Lock and Key, at the lower end of Fleet Street near Fetter Lane, were spacious enough, for here on 19 December 1641 he preached before about 150 people, including (according to an outraged reporter) as many women as men. Perhaps Barbon was straining to make himself heard before such a crowd, but the noise of his oration attracted the attention of passers-by. Outside the Lock and Key, hostile crowds gathered. In the course of a long sermon directed against the bishops and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, apprentices began smashing the windows and sought to break down the door. Eventually the constables arrived; some of Barbon's congregation were taken to the Bridewell prison, others to the Counters, and still others made their escape over the roof-tops, while the crowd was left to destroy his shop-sign.<br>
<br>Barbon's association with the Jessey church and its offshoots brought him into contact with groups more hostile to the Church of England. At the Lock and Key disturbance, a second preacher, the separatist leader John Green, was also arrested. The following month more than fifty persons, including many members or former members of Jessey's church, were rebaptized by immersion in London. Barbon strongly disagreed with these advocates of believers' baptism, and within a few weeks he issued <span class="italic">A Discourse Tending to Prove the Baptism &hellip; to be the Ordinance of Jesus Christ</span>. No evidence has been discovered for the frequent assertion that Barbon himself was rebaptized; the claim that he was an &#145;anabaptist&#146; probably derives from post-Restoration royalist diatribes. However, his <span class="italic">Discourse</span> and a second work issued in spring 1643, <span class="italic">A Reply to the Frivolous and Impertinent Answer of RB</span>, are important sources for the views and practices of the Baptists at this early stage in their development. Just like other controversialists, such as the separatist Samuel Chidley, Barbon defended baptisms received in the Church of England, though unlike Chidley he also defended the authenticity of the English church. However, Barbon stood for a broadly pluralistic outlook against the enthusiasts for the imposition of Anglican orthodoxy. God &#145;causeth much profit to come out of the variations of his servants, the truth is the more sought into and discovered, and cometh to shine forth more fully afterward&#146;  (Barbon, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, A3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Barbon's adherence to semi-separatist views, in the tradition of Henry Jacob, enabled him to participate in the political life of the parish. He was involved over the next few years in a series of conflicts with the group of wealthy men who controlled the vestry of St Dunstan-in-the-West, and with Francis Kemp, the lawyer and (up to 1642) common councillor who acted for them. In 1643 Barbon was involved in an action against the parish officers in the court of king's bench; in 1645 he was chosen as a member of a committee for the establishment of a free school in the parish, but this too seems to have involved wrangles with the vestry. The following year there was controversy over the election by show of hands of a churchwarden. It seems that one source of tension was the high presbyterianism of the vicar, Anthony Perne, to whom Barbon and some other prominent parishioners were strongly opposed, and another was the exclusion of many householders from the franchise. Barbon was made third warden of the Leathersellers' Company in 1648, but it was only the following year, after the purge of presbyterians from the City government, that he was returned as common councilman for his parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West. Other radicals and separatists were becoming prominent in London politics at the same time. Barbon was re-elected as a common councilman for 1650&#150;51, and served also on the committee of safety in 1651.<br>
<br>The peak of Barbon's political career, however, was in 1653, when he was selected, as one of the seven members for London, for the parliament which, probably even while it was sitting, attracted the sobriquet derived from his name. It seems that in July 1653 the London bookseller George Thomason picked up a list of the members of &#145;Barebones Parliament&#146;, in which those of moderate politics were distinguished from the rest. The combination of Barbon's pious first name, his unfortunate surname (lampooned as Rawbones by John Taylor even twelve years earlier), and his (relatively) humble social status were all open to ridicule. This combination was irresistible to opponents of the assembly, keen to belittle it. Barbon himself was a member of the committee which published on 12 July the enthusiastic and hopeful announcement in which the new body proclaimed itself the parliament of the Commonwealth, and he was shortly appointed to the committee for receiving petitions. Though never elected to the council of state, Barbon was in the second rank of the most active and influential members in the new house. He was one of the radicals who sat on the committee on tithes set up on 19 July, and was also one of the thirteen original members of the committee established on 19 August to consider a thoroughgoing reform of the law. In late July at Westminster large numbers of women demonstrated in support of John Lilburne, who was on trial having returned to London from exile without a pass. Possibly it was Barbon's reputation as a radical, and his long history of involvement with the semi-separatists, that led parliament to select him for the unrewarding task of placating Kathleen Chidley and the other leaders.<br>
<br>It is clear that while Barbon was more radical than some, he did not always vote with the radicals, and appeared more than once as a teller in divisions alongside a known moderate. Sometimes, however, his opposition to apparently radical innovations such as the bill for a high court of justice, defeated on 28 September, probably arose from the fear that the new instrument might be used against radicals as well as royalists. Among the more extreme members of parliament was the group of Fifth Monarchists. It may be suspected that Barbon shared their millennial aspirations, but he was uneasy about both their predictions and the insurrection to which many looked forward. In November 1654 members of ten London congregations signed a Fifth Monarchist declaration against what they took to be the most offensive features of the newly established protectorate. Though more than twenty members of his congregation set their names to this work, Barbon did not, and neither does he appear to have been involved in any of the later Fifth Monarchist plots against the Cromwellian regime.<br>
<br>Barbon was re-elected to the common council for the three years from 1657 to 1660, and after the restoration of the Rump Parliament he was named to the London militia committee under the act of 7 July 1659. In January 1660 he was one of the common councillors who opposed the proposal that the City should send its compliments to General George Monck. The following month he was appointed as controller of the commissioners for compounding at the generous salary of &pound;300 p.a. Barbon was the chief promoter of a petition presented to parliament on 7 February in the name of the well affected of London and Westminster. This warned against the &#145;return of the justly-secluded members, or a Free Parliament, without due qualifications&#146;  (Davies, 279) and demanded that all office-holders, and members of either parliament or the council of state, should renounce both Charles Stuart and rule by any other single person. It probably helped provoke, during the next few weeks, the two attacks on his house by royalist crowds. The smashing of Barbon's windows marked both the beginning and the end of the interregnum.<br>
<br>In July, following the Restoration, there appeared a royalist tract, the <span class="italic">Picture of the Good Old Cause Drawn to the Life</span>, which reprinted the petition of 7 February and published also an engraving in which Barbon appears in gaunt and serious mien with cap and gown. On 5 September 1661 it was reported that he was a frequent visitor to both Vavasor Powell and Major John Bremen, then in the Fleet prison. These were dangerous connections, and Barbon was also named as one of those who frequented Nonsuch House in Bow Street, a republican meeting place. He was arrested on 25 November 1661 and charged with treason alongside James Harrington and Samuel Moyer. These and others were thought to have plotted the military seizure of London and restoration of the Long Parliament. On 27 July 1662, following a petition of his wife, Sarah, it was ordered that Barbon be freed from his close imprisonment in the Tower, since he was &#145;so ill that he must perish unless released&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 447). The fortunes of the Lock and Key did not improve. Barbon had taken out a new fourteen-year lease on the premises in 1656 at the very considerable rent of &pound;40 p.a., but in 1666 it was one of the most westerly buildings to be engulfed in the great fire of London. The loss of his workplace must have caused Barbon acute difficulty. On 10 March 1667, in the court of judicature, he obtained a judgment against his landlords, a widow, Elizabeth Speght, and her son Paul Speght, which stipulated that in exchange for rebuilding the property, he should be entitled to a reduction in annual rent to &pound;15, and that on these terms forty extra years should be added to the lease. On 5 January 1669, having completed the work, Barbon sold the rights and the lease to his son Nicholas, who proceeded to take out a mortgage for &pound;300, probably to help his father recoup some of the considerable costs of reconstruction.<br>
<br>This experience did nothing to weaken Barbon's millenarian convictions. In <span class="italic">Good Things to Come</span> (1675) Barbon looked forward to the coming of Christ and his rule for a thousand years: &#145;his kingdom and reign shall be outward, and visible on earth &hellip; when he shall come the second time, in power and great glory&#146;  (p. 10). Barbon died about the end of 1679 and was buried on 5 January 1680 near the artillery ground, in the parish of St Andrew Holborn.<br>
