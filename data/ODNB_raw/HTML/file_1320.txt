<span class="headword">Banting,  William</span>  (1796/7&#150;1878), <span class="occ">writer on diet</span>, was a funeral director in St James's Street, London. He may have been the William Banting, son of Thomas Banting and his wife, Ann, who was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, in December 1796. On 20 January 1818 he married at St Mary's, Newington, London, Mary Ann Thurmott (1793&#150;1862).<br>
<br>Banting was somewhat short (5 feet 5 inches), and as he got older suffered great personal distress from his increasing fatness. It was said that by the time he was sixty he found himself unable to stoop to tie his shoes, &#145;or attend to the little offices which humanity requires, without considerable pain and difficulty&#146;. He was forced to go downstairs slowly backwards, to avoid the jar of increased weight on the ankle joints, and with every exertion &#145;puffed and blowed in a way that was very unseemly and disagreeable&#146;. His doctors told him to take exercise, which he did; he walked long distances, rowed, and took up other sports. But all this only improved his appetite and added to his weight, and no other solution was offered. On 26 August 1862 at the age of sixty-five, he weighed 14 st 6 lb, an amount which he found unbearable. After further trying a course of fifty Turkish baths and &#145;gallons of physic&#146; without any success, he happened to consult a surgeon, Mr William Harvey, for an increasing problem of deafness. Mr Harvey, believing that obesity was the source of the hearing problem, suggested that Banting cut out bread, butter, milk, sugar, beer, soup, potatoes, and beans, and in their place adopt a diet of mainly flesh meat, fish, and dry toast. The result of this treatment was a gradual reduction of 46 lb in weight, and better health at the end of several weeks than Banting had enjoyed for the previous twenty years.<br>
<br>The delight at being so much relieved by such simple means induced Banting to write and publish a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public</span> (1863), in which he singled out sugar and fats as the chief causes of obesity. Written in plain, sensible language, this tract became an overnight success. There were four editions by 1869, and it was successfully translated into French and German. &#145;To bant&#146;, or &#145;banting&#146;, became a popular phrase for adopting a slimming diet and continued in use well into the twentieth century; it remains the accepted word in some languages, such as Swedish. Thousands took up the Banting dietary principles, and thus threw the medical profession into great confusion over the right &#145;carbonaceous and nitrogenous qualities of food&#146;&#151;doctors were especially concerned at the exclusion of milk. As a <span class="italic">Times</span> leader commented: &#145;Whatever medical men may say, the chymistry of digestion is at present very little understood, and the reason amateurs are beginning to dogmatise upon it is that physicians have neglected a material part of their own science&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Sept 1864). Certainly a great deal of research was undertaken in food chemistry in the last quarter of the century; and far greater attention was paid to diet in the patient's regimen after Banting.<br>
<br>Banting scrupulously donated the profits of his book to charity, and continued to take an interest in charitable hospitals until his death at his house in The Terrace, Kensington, London, on 16 March 1878, aged eighty-one. According to Banting's will, he had three daughters and two sons.<br>
