<span class="headword">Redman,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1528), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was the son of Thomas Redman (<i>d</i>. 1516), a mason, and, presumably, of his wife in 1516, Alice. Henry's will of 1 July 1528 reveals him to be of the family of &#145;Reedmans&#146; living &#145;besyde our Lady of Reedbone&#146;, a chapel in the parish of Bury near Ramsey in Huntingdonshire. Henry's father was a working mason at Westminster Abbey from 1490 until 1505, when he became the abbey's master mason. He held this post until his death in 1516, when he was succeeded by Henry. In 1495&#150;7 Redman was working on the completion of the nave of Westminster Abbey, at the same rate of pay as his father. He is next documented in 1501&#150;4 carrying out a contract for building the Observant Franciscan friary founded by Henry VII beside his newly reconstructed palace of Richmond. Redman's fellow contractors were Henry Binks, master of the London Carpenters' Company, and Robert Nevill, a brickmaker and bricklayer.<br>
<br>In his capacity as master mason of Westminster Abbey, Henry Redman continued the building of the nave and rebuilt the chancel of St Margaret's Church from 1516 to 1523. It is highly likely that he was also responsible for the sumptuous chantry chapel built by Abbot Islip on the north side of the presbytery during the early 1520s. In 1516, along with the master mason William Vertue and the master carpenter Humphrey Coke, Redman drew up the designs for the west cloister range and gatehouse (Lupton's Tower) at Eton College. In the meantime he had been put in charge of Cardinal Wolsey's two main building projects, York Place (later Whitehall Palace) and Hampton Court, begun in 1514 and 1515 respectively. By 1525 he had become joint master mason with John Lebons for Wolsey's third great project, Cardinal College (now Christ Church), Oxford. The simultaneous employment of two master masons is unusual in the late medieval and early modern periods in England, but it is a feature of many of the largest and most rapidly prosecuted early Tudor royal works. It was probably intended to insure against the disruption which the sudden demise of a master mason would normally cause, and it may well be significant that the plague was especially virulent during these years. Lebons seems to have been the more active of the college's two master masons until the work was halted by Wolsey's fall in 1529.<br>
<br>For Henry VIII, Redman built in 1516&#150;19 two towers for viewing jousts in the tiltyard of Greenwich Palace. On 12 September 1519 he became king's chief mason, jointly with William Vertue, and on 19 July 1520 he was appointed chief mason at Windsor Castle, evidently a sinecure. The fact that when Redman died on 10 July 1528 Henry VIII said that he was &#145;sorry&#146; indicates that the king had good cause to regret the loss of his master mason, the implication being that Redman was very competent and had done considerably more royal work than is revealed by the extant documentation. Redman typifies the architects employed by Wolsey and by Henry VIII during the earlier part of his reign in that his work was stylistically heavily dependent on the principal buildings erected for Henry VII. His work at York Place and Hampton Court, in brick with stone dressings, has the same informality of composition and simplicity of detailing as the north range of Greenwich Palace by Robert Vertue (begun 1500), and the only technically and aesthetically complex work attributable to Redman, the Islip chantry chapel, reiterates with minimal variation much of the rich and novel ornamental vocabulary of the nearby lady chapel (Henry VII's Chapel), designed by Robert Janyns and begun in 1503.<br>
<br>A damaged and incomplete brass showing two unnamed daughters survives (in the Museum of London) from an otherwise lost monument erected to Redman and his wife, Joan, in the chapel of St Lawrence, Brentford, Middlesex. The original site of the monument, on the north side of the sanctuary, was the most prestigious available for any tomb, and was no doubt granted because Henry and Joan had given lands which doubled the income of the chapel's priest. That the trustees of this endowment were Master John Spelman, the future king's bench judge, and his wife and son, is valuable evidence of the connections and social standing of a royal master mason early in Henry VIII's reign.<br>
