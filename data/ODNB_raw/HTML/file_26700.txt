<span class="headword">Stuart,  Daniel</span>  (1766&#150;1846), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and journalist</span>, was born on 16 November 1766 in Edinburgh. Both his father and his grandfather were reputed to have been active Jacobites. In 1778 he went to London to join his elder brothers, <a href="#cosubject_26725">Peter [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Charles, who were already established in the print trade there. The three set up home in Charlotte Street, Portland Place, with their two sisters, Catherine and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>By 1788 Daniel Stuart was listed as the printer of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. In 1795 he bought the paper for the relatively small sum of &pound;600, after its circulation had fallen to about 350 copies per day. Under Stuart's leadership the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> appears to have flourished. He claimed to have increased sales to more than 4500 by 1803. In this year he reportedly sold it owing to ill health for &pound;25,000. Before this temporary interruption to his career Stuart had absorbed another newspaper, <span class="italic">The Telegraph</span>, into his fledgeling business empire, and attempted to buy the ailing <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> in 1797.<br>
<br>During the early 1790s Stuart became deputy secretary of the Society of the Friends of the People, a group which campaigned for parliamentary reform. In 1794 his pamphlet <span class="italic">Peace and Reform, Against War and Corruption</span> appeared. The work, which was dedicated to the society, attacked Arthur Young's warning against following the example of the French revolutionaries, defended the revolution, and proposed a programme of parliamentary reform in Britain. In 1796 the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> serialized Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance</span>. The paper received harsh criticism from the pro-establishment newspaper the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin</span>. Stuart's brother-in-law was the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17620/', "Sir James Mackintosh (1765&#150;1832)")</script>, honorary secretary of the Society of the Friends of the People, whom his sister Catherine had secretly married in 1789. Mackintosh wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. Other contributors to the paper included Coleridge, Southey, Godwin, Lamb, and John Thelwall.<br>
<br>In 1800 or 1801 Stuart purchased <span class="italic">The Courier</span> with T. G. Street. Although they held an equal number of shares, Street was described as the sole editor. In 1815 Crabb Robinson claimed that Stuart had long since ceased to have anything to do with the management of the paper, but simply took his share of the profits and looked over the accounts. However, Coleridge appears to have attributed much of the paper's political tone to Stuart. During the Napoleonic wars <span class="italic">The Courier</span> was fiercely patriotic, its conservatism providing a sharp contrast to the radical edge which the <span class="italic">Post</span> had displayed. Coleridge, in a letter to Stuart which reveals the <span class="italic">Courier</span>'s importance, asserted that the paper greatly contributed to Napoleon's defeat by ensuring public support for the government's war efforts:<blockquote>It is far, very far, from hyperbole to affirm, that you did more against the French scheme of Continental domination, than the Duke of Wellington has done; or rather Wellington could neither have been supplied by the Ministers, nor the Ministers supported by the Nation, but for the tone first given, and then constantly kept up, by the plain, unministerial, anti-opposition, anti-jacobin, anti-gallican, anti-Napoleonic spirit of your writings, aided by the colloquial good style, and evident good sense, in which as acting on an immense mass of knowledge of existing men and existing circumstances, you are superior to any man I ever met with in my life time. (Coleridge, 2.660)</blockquote>Canning claimed that, unknown to Stuart, Street was given as much as &pound;2000 to support the Perceval ministry in <span class="italic">The Courier</span>. Stuart himself maintained that neither he nor the paper had ever taken such bribes. He wrote to J. Benjafield in 1811:<blockquote>I often hear of persons, and sometimes meet them, who assert that they can prove I receive a regular salary from the ministry for the support <span class="italic">The Courier</span> gives them, though I never received a shilling from any minister, or for any such consideration. (Benjafield, iv)</blockquote>A letter from Canning to Huskisson in 1809 states that Stuart was still writing for the paper and that Street and Stuart were divided politically, with Stuart opposed to <span class="italic">The Courier</span>'s attacks on Canning. In 1823 Stuart still owned a third share of <span class="italic">The Courier</span> but appears to have fallen out with William Mudford, who became editor in 1817, again over politics. Stuart refused to back Mudford in his denial that he was in the pay of the French government.<br>
<br>Stuart married Mary Napier in 1813, and they went on to have three sons. The following year he bought a house in Harley Street, having made a large fortune from his newspaper ventures. In 1817 he successfully pursued a case for libel against Daniel Lovell, the proprietor of <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, who had accused him of embezzling money from the funds of the Society of the Friends of the People. In the same year Stuart purchased Wykeham Park, a 300 acre estate near Banbury. Here he spent half of each year, becoming an active magistrate, a deputy lieutenant, and in 1823 serving as high sheriff. He died in his London home on 25 August 1846. His demise has been partly attributed to the shock of his eldest son's death in 1842, which brought about a long illness culminating in a fatal bout of dysentery. Although he had been involved in a public argument with the executors of Coleridge's estate concerning his alleged mistreatment of the poet, Charles Lamb said of Stuart that &#145;He ever appeared to us one of the finest tempered of Editors&#146;  (Lamb, 212).<br>
<br>Daniel's brother <a name="cosubject_26725"></a><span class="headword">Peter Stuart</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1760, <em>d.</em> in or after 1812), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, purchased <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> in 1794, reputedly for as little as &pound;80 since the circulation was only 800 a day. He had previously started the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>, the first daily evening paper in London. In 1805 <span class="italic">The Oracle</span> was accused of publishing a libel on the House of Commons, following the publication of an article about Lord Melville. Peter Stuart was forced to appear at the house to apologise. In 1812 he asked the prince of Wales for a sinecure in return for a pamphlet written in his support, entitled <span class="italic">Thoughts on the State of the Country</span>. This request was granted, apparently after Stuart threatened the prince with negative publicity.<br>
