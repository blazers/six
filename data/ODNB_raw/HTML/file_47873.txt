<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waterhouse,  Edwin</span>  (1841&#150;1917), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born on 4 June 1841 at Oakfield, Aigburth, Liverpool, the seventh and youngest child of Alfred Waterhouse senior (1798&#150;1873), a partner in the firm of Nicholas Waterhouse &amp; Sons, merchants and brokers of Liverpool, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bevan (1805&#150;1880). He spent most of his childhood in the south of England at several family homes, including Sneyd Park, near Bristol, and various addresses in central London.<br>
<br>Having been taught by private tutors, and because his parents were committed members of the Society of Friends, in September 1855 Waterhouse entered University College School, a leading academy for dissenters. A diligent student, he won prizes in French and geometry, and two years later joined his elder brother Theodore (1838&#150;1891) at University College, London, where he attended classes in mathematics, Greek, Latin, and English. He graduated in 1860 with second-class honours, but had made no decision about a future career. His elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36758/', "Alfred Waterhouse (1830&#150;1905)")</script> was already established as an architect, Theodore was to take articles as a solicitor, and Edwin, as he later recalled,<blockquote>had allowed this important matter to be in abeyance. I knew nothing of business, and felt a dislike of the &#145;city&#146; and &hellip; the pale and anxious faces which I saw on my infrequent visits there. A doctor's career might have suited me, but I had no special bent in that way, and I feared a failure. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 68)</blockquote>A chance introduction to William Turquand, a leading accountant, led to Waterhouse being articled to the City firm of Coleman, Turquand, Youngs &amp; Co. in January 1861. There he learned the rudiments of bookkeeping and assisted with insolvencies and audits, but after three years of what he described as an &#145;apprenticeship&#146; decided to set up on his own account. In February 1864 he took two rooms at 11 Old Jewry Chambers and wrote to business acquaintances of his father in order to seek employment. A major source of income during his first year in practice was the reorganization of the accounts of his brother, then a prominent architect in Manchester. While undertaking a cost-accounting assignment at John Fowler's steam plough works in Leeds, Waterhouse met William Holyland (1807&#150;1882), a principal clerk of Turquand, who informed him that he was about to form a partnership with Samuel Lowell Price (1821&#150;1887). Holyland suggested that he join them and, as Waterhouse wrote,<blockquote>I had been doing very well for myself during the last few months, but the offer seemed to open out chances of quickly attaining a wider experience, whilst ensuring a more steady practice and affording me the advantages of assistance should I need it. (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 81)</blockquote>Thus, the firm of Price, Holyland, and Waterhouse was formed on 1 May 1865; Edwin, the youngest and least experienced, took a quarter-share in the profits.<br>
<br>Having leased prestigious offices in the Queens Assurance Company building at the corner of Gresham Street (no. 13, later 44) and King Street, the firm flourished from the outset. Unlike the first generation of accountancy firms which prospered as insolvency specialists, Price, Holyland, and Waterhouse gained a reputation as auditors largely as a result of Waterhouse's work for railway companies, banks, and financial institutions. His probity and insistence upon prudent conventions won him important audits, including the London and North Western, South Eastern, Metropolitan, and London, Brighton and South Coast railways. Waterhouse was so busy with these tasks that in 1883 he declined to serve as the auditor of the Midland Railway. In addition, he was appointed joint auditor of the National Provincial Bank of England (from 1880) and of the London and Westminster Bank, while the firm audited Lloyds Bank, the Gresham Life Assurance Society, Atlas Assurance, the Equity and Law Life Assurance Company, and the Foreign and Colonial Government Trust Company from its foundation in 1868. The rising fee income of the partnership was a measure of its commercial success. In the first year of operation it earned &pound;9138, increasing to an average of &pound;14,450 between 1870 and 1885, with peaks in 1870 (&pound;18,070), 1876 (&pound;17,135), and 1877 (&pound;17,749). Fees rose appreciably after 1889 and during the following decade were in excess of &pound;40,000 per annum. In 1887, on the death of Price, Edwin Waterhouse became senior partner (Holyland having retired in 1874) and, as was customary, took a lion's share of the profits. In 1896&#150;7, for example, when &pound;35,897 was available for distribution among the four partners, he received &pound;21,000 (59 per cent). This level of income enabled him to build a substantial home in the country, Feldemore, at Holmbury St Mary, Abinger, near Dorking, Surrey, which was designed by his brother-in-law George Redmayne, the Manchester architect; he occupied the house from 1880 and progressively extended it during the 1890s. At his death he left an estate worth &pound;257,780 gross, and it appeared that the greater part of his fortune had been earned from professional fees rather than share dealing or other forms of financial speculation.<br>
<br>Waterhouse was also called upon to undertake a number of investigations by companies, institutions, and government bodies. In 1877 he devised a sliding scale for the Consett Iron Company, by which wages could be related to the sale price of iron; in 1889 he assisted Lancashire county council in allocating receipts and expenditure between boroughs and urban districts under the new <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span>; and in 1908 he reorganized the finances of the Underground Electric Railway of London. In 1887&#150;8 Waterhouse, together with Frederick Whinney (1829&#150;1916), produced a report on the accounting organization of the Woolwich arsenal for a parliamentary committee chaired by Lord Randolph Churchill. He was subsequently asked to conduct similar investigations into the Admiralty's dockyards (1888&#150;9) and the Royal Ordnance factories (1901). A member of the 1894&#150;5 Davey departmental committee on joint-stock companies, he was responsible for representing the profession's views, and the report which followed formed the basis for the <span class="roman">Companies Act</span> of 1900. When further change was considered, Waterhouse was invited to serve on the 1905&#150;6 (Loreburn) committee, which, in turn, led to the <span class="roman">Companies Act</span> of 1907. However, despite these achievements, it would be wrong to view Waterhouse as one of the outstanding original thinkers of the profession. His talents lay not so much with the introduction of radical ideas as in the practical organization and running of a major City partnership. He had the social contacts to attract new clients, the ability to maintain established connections, and the judgement to select staff of youthful promise (he introduced a policy of recruiting prizewinners from the institute examinations).<br>
<br>Having been a founder member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) on its foundation in 1880, Waterhouse became active in its organization. Although he failed at the first attempt to be elected to the council, in 1887 he took the place formerly occupied by Price. In 1892, without having held the customary post of vice-president, he was elected president and served for two years. Not all of his presidential initiatives were successful, and his campaign to establish a professional monopoly, as exercised by legal and medical practitioners, did not meet with government approval. His presidency corresponded with the opening in 1893 of the ICAEW's purpose-built hall in Moorgate. He retired from the council in July 1915 after twenty-eight years' service.<br>
<br>Ernest Cooper (1848&#150;1926), another eminent City accountant, reported that Waterhouse &#145;always showed me rather more courtesy than I deserved&#146;  (Cooper, 49), while Nicholas Waterhouse, Waterhouse's youngest son by his first marriage, observed that &#145;he never suffered a fool gladly but had a wonderful insight into character, and those who really knew him held him in the highest respect and affection&#146;  (Waterhouse, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 3). An inability to tolerate any behaviour that might pass for slackness and his ingrained Quaker mores led to a prohibition of smoking. If Waterhouse &#145;found a pipe or pouch lying around in the office or in the audit room of a client, he thought nothing of throwing them on the fire but, then relenting, would compensate the offender with the price of a new outfit&#146;  (ibid., 102). He periodically suffered from the depression that had afflicted his mother in her later life, and a devotion to Christianity, together with a thorough commitment to his professional duties, may have served as defence against its onset.<br>
<br>In 1868 Waterhouse married Georgina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Th&ouml;l (1848&#150;1896); they had four daughters and two sons, William and Nicholas. Both boys joined Price Waterhouse as articled clerks, but William died suddenly of pneumonia in 1900 before taking his final examination; Nicholas qualified, was admitted to the partnership in 1906 on his father's retirement, and became the senior partner in 1945. In 1898, two years after the death of his first wife, Waterhouse married Helen Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weber (1855&#150;1941); they had one son, Theodore (1907&#150;1976), who also worked for Price Waterhouse. Edwin Waterhouse died, aged seventy-six, at Feldemore, on 17 September 1917 and was buried in the parish churchyard at Holmbury St Mary.<br>
