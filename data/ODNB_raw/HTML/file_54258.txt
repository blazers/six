<span class="headword">Leuchars,  Patrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1383), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Brechin</span>, probably came of a Fife family. He would have entered the Augustinian priory of St Andrews before taking the parsonage of Tyninghame, whose patronage belonged to the bishop of St Andrews, in 1344. He had exchanged it for or also had Tannadice when he was elected to the see of Brechin after 3 May 1351. This election, possibly engineered by Queen Joan at a time when David II's return from captivity in England was possible, was quashed by the pope, who provided Leuchars on 17 November 1351; he was consecrated within a month, presumably at Avignon. After the king's brief visit to Scotland in 1351&#150;2, Leuchars is found as chancellor in March and December 1353. Although he had lost office by 12 February 1354, he was present at a council on 1 April 1354, held to discuss the king's ransom. Royal authority crumbled under the ineffectual regency of Robert Stewart in 1354&#150;7, but the impending return of the king saw a chancellor, Leuchars, appointed by 26 September 1357. He continued to hold office during the subsequent years of heavy taxation and political wrangling and, while it is uncertain what his duties were in chancery, the two acts of revocation of title increased the business of that office significantly. He sat regularly at the exchequer until January 1369, and was twice an ambassador to England in 1360&#150;62. The king made Edinburgh a <i>de facto</i> capital, but travel was still required and may have become increasingly difficult for Leuchars. He is last found as chancellor on 4 March 1370; his successor occurs a month later.<br>
<br>Leuchars was the last member of a religious order to hold the office of chancellor. Clearly a strong supporter of David II during his years of captivity, he lost office during the regency of Robert Stewart and was rewarded by David II's support after 1357. He was not prominent under Robert II, but was present at the parliament of 1373. Ten years later, early in June 1383, he resigned his see at Avignon on account of age, receiving a pension of 100 merks from its revenues. The date of his death is unknown, and he may not have returned to Scotland.<br>
