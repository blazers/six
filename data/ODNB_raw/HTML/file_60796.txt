<span class="headword">Read,  Alfred <span class="st"> [Al]</span></span>  (1909&#150;1987), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born at 11 Kipling Street, Salford, Lancashire, on 3 March 1909, the second of the six children of William Henry (Herbert) Read and his wife, Elizabeth Fielding. He spent the first six years of his life in &#145;a two up, two down in Kipling Street, Salford&#146;  (Read, 17). His father and uncles had been in the meat processing business but went bankrupt. Eventually their fortunes recovered, the debts were paid off, the business was relaunched, and the family moved to Sedgely Park when Al was six. He was educated at St John's infants school, Sedgely Park, and North Manchester preparatory grammar school, leaving at fifteen to join the family firm of E. and H. Read Ltd as a salesman. He was such a success that he was a director by the age of twenty-three and eventually, when his father retired, took over the running of the business. On 18 April 1938 he married Joyce (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), daughter of Fred Entwistle, town clerk. There were two sons and a daughter from that marriage, which ended in divorce in 1970. During the Second World War Read developed a new canned meal, Frax Fratters, which immediately became the butt of comedians' jokes. He also served in the Prestwich Home Guard.<br>
<br>Read's salesman patter had incorporated anecdotes, jokes, and accents; he developed this into an act, which he called &#145;Pictures from Life&#146;, and began to perform as an amateur in theatres and holiday camps and in after-dinner speeches. As a monologist he was in an established comic tradition already mastered by Robb Wilton and Norman Evans. One of his performances caught the attention of the BBC light entertainment producer Bowker Andrews, who signed him up for radio. He made his d&eacute;but on radio in <span class="italic">Variety Fanfare</span> in 1950. He was an immediate success and soon had his own show, <span class="italic">Such is Life</span>, which was to run in various guises for twenty years. It brought him the &#145;most promising comedy show&#146; award at the 1951 <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> radio awards and an invitation to perform for the royal family at Windsor. From radio he moved to the variety stage, topping the bill at Blackpool and the London Palladium. His catch-phrases, &#145;You'll be lucky&#146; and &#145;Right, monkey&#146;, swept the nation. Read did summer seasons and pantomime and in 1954 opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London's West End in a revue, <span class="italic">You'll Be Lucky</span>, which ran for twelve months. He returned to the Adelphi in 1956 with another revue, <span class="italic">Such is Life</span>.<br>
<br>In the 1960s Read sold the family business and moved reluctantly and belatedly into television, but he did not like it and his style was anyway quintessentially radio. He abandoned television and retreated to the northern club circuit, playing his last Blackpool summer show in 1970. When his first marriage ended he married, on 13 June 1970, a model, Elizabeth Ann Read (<i>b</i>. 1937/8), a divorcee (whose former husband was also named Read) and daughter of Frederick Howard Allen, an architect. From then on he divided his time between Spain, where he had built a house near Almeria, and Yorkshire, where he had a cottage near Leyburn in the dales. In 1976 the BBC discovered that it had wiped all the tapes of his radio shows and he was persuaded to re-record his classic routines, which were subsequently issued on audio cassette. In 1985 he published an autobiography, <span class="italic">It's All in the Book</span>.<br>
<br>Read was a master of the monologue and radio was his ideal medium. In his show he did all the voices, including the dog. There were no costumes, wigs, or disguises&#151;it was pure vocal comedy. Working with experienced scriptwriter Ronnie Taylor he had converted his ideas and anecdotes into perfectly honed and timed scripts, based on Read's total mastery of the vocal patterns, preoccupations, values, and mores of his northern audience. The laughter of recognition from the audience is continually in evidence in recordings of his shows. The nagging wife &#145;from the kitchen&#146;, the embarrassingly forthright and questioning child (&#145;Dad, Dad, what's that man doing, Dad?&#146;), the know-all from next door (&#145;You'll be lucky, I say, you'll be lucky&#146;), and a gormless phone-user (&#145;Just, just, just a minute&#146;) were regular features, as were send-ups of institutions, the police force, the Post Office, hospitals, and garages. His classic sketches were &#145;The Decorator&#146;, &#145;The Gardener&#146;, &#145;The Football Match&#146;, and &#145;The Chip Shop&#146;.<br>
<br>Read's signature tune, &#145;Such is life&#146;, which he wrote with Ronnie Taylor:<blockquote>
<div>Such is life,<br>
</div>
<div>life is what you make it,<br>
</div>
<div>Show 'em you can take it on the chin<br>
</div>
</blockquote>was in the optimistic, never-say-die vein of fellow northern comedians such as Gracie Fields and George Formby. Audiences related to his routines because they were truthful and based on precise observation of reality. Read wrote:<blockquote>The comedy had grown up with me and reflected my own personal experience &hellip; I never tried to make people laugh, and there were never any &#145;gags&#146; as such in my routines &hellip; All the story lines were culled from the small embarrassments and frustrations of everyday life &hellip; the tittle tattle that makes the world of ordinary folk go round; the exchange of rumours and confidences in small confined places&#151;in the corner shop, on top of the bus. (Read, 68&#150;71)</blockquote>Offstage Al Read was known for his sartorial elegance, a cultured voice, and a love of horses and riding. He died on 9 September 1987 in Rutson Hospital at Northallerton following a stroke. His wife survived him.<br>
