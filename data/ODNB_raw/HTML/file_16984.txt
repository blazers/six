<span class="headword">Longesp&eacute;e, Sir  William (II)</span>  (<em>c.</em>1209&#150;1250), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47205/', "Ela, countess of Salisbury (b. in or after 1190, d. 1261)")</script>, in whom the earldom was vested, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16983/', "William (I) Longesp&#233;e (b. in or before 1167, d. 1226)")</script>. He had three brothers, of whom the youngest was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95180/', "Nicholas Longspr&#233;e")</script>, later bishop of Salisbury, and four sisters. His marriage to Idonea, heir of Richard de Camville and Eustacia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1639/', "Gilbert Basset")</script>, was arranged in April 1216; they married between 1226 and 1230.<h2>
<a name="Militaryserviceandroyalfavour"></a>Military service and royal favour</h2>A minor at his father's death, Longesp&eacute;e was knighted by his cousin Henry III at Gloucester at Whitsuntide 1233, but he must have attained his majority before that since Henry had intended to knight him at Easter 1230. Moreover, in March 1230 Countess Ela was instructed to surrender to William all the lands she held of inheritance as the wife of William (I) Longesp&eacute;e, along with other properties granted to her son by Henry in 1228&#150;9; and in November 1230 William paid homage for the lands claimed by his wife, Idonea, as of hereditary right. Earlier that year, he had accompanied Henry III on his ill-fated expedition to Brittany. This was his first taste of military action, and for the rest of his short life he was to be closely associated with his royal cousin, largely in a military capacity. In the autumn of 1233, during the rebellion of Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, he was at Henry's side in the operations against the Welsh and other supporters of the earl. In 1234 he was engaged in the pursuit and arrest of Peter des Rivaux. After returning from his first crusade (discussed below), he played a leading role in Henry III's expedition to Gascony in 1242&#150;3. The number of royal charters he attested there, and the fact that he generally heads the list of lay witnesses, indicates his high standing in the king's regard and counsels. He fought at the battle of Saintes (July 1242), and was appointed captain of a number of subsequent operations, including the raid into P&eacute;rigord in late 1242 and the siege of Garro in 1243. Back in England, Longesp&eacute;e went in royal service to Wales in June 1245, in response to the Welsh rising of 1244&#150;5 under Dafydd ap Llywelyn.<br>
<br>Longesp&eacute;e did well from his career in royal service, as the favours showered upon him in these years indicate, but the earldom of Salisbury was denied him. He clearly expected to receive the comital title, for a number of his <i>acta</i> (1231&#150;7) contain explicit statements of his hopes. In 1237&#150;8 he claimed by hereditary right custody of Salisbury Castle and the <i>comitatus</i> of Wiltshire, of which Patrick, earl of Salisbury, had been seised in Henry II's reign. Judgment against Longesp&eacute;e may have been given before his departure on crusade in 1240; if so, he did not give up, for he was pestering the king during 1242 when both were in Gascony. On 16 October 1242 Henry promised that on his return to England he would judge concerning the county of Wiltshire and Salisbury Castle. If judgment went against Longesp&eacute;e he and his heirs would receive 40 marks per annum from the revenues of the county; if he were successful, the king would be quit of that sum and of the 60 marks per annum granted to Longesp&eacute;e until judgment were made. Since judgment indeed went against him, for reasons that remain somewhat puzzling, it is not surprising that Longesp&eacute;e does not appear so high in Henry's counsels after their return to England in 1243; he was much less frequently at court in the following years. Relations were certainly not embittered, however, for Henry continued to dispense patronage and favours to him, and, according to Matthew Paris, he was not unduly aggrieved. He apparently accepted, however reluctantly, the crown's arguments regarding the comital title, and he possessed, of course, the lands attached to the earldom, concentrated largely in Wiltshire and Dorset. Lesser holdings, including those brought to him through acquisition and marriage, were located in Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Surrey, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Northamptonshire, and, more importantly, Lincolnshire and Somerset.<h2>
<a name="Religionandthecrusades"></a>Religion and the crusades</h2>Longesp&eacute;e was a man of some piety. He patronized the Franciscans of Salisbury and Oxford, and the Dominicans of Wilton, besides making notable grants to monastic houses of his family's connection, especially Lacock Abbey and Bradenstoke Priory. He also twice went on pilgrimage overseas: in 1232 to an unknown shrine, and in 1245 to Santiago de Compostela. This behaviour, combined with his active military career, helps to explain his particular association with crusading. He went on crusade twice, something that marks him out from most of his contemporaries and suggests a genuine crusading enthusiast. He first took the cross in June 1236 at Winchester, along with Richard, earl of Cornwall, and other associates. They left Dover in June 1240, travelled across France for embarkation at Marseilles, and landed at Acre in October. This crusade was marked by its lack of action in the field, and it can be assumed that Longesp&eacute;e performed no memorable deeds, especially since no later source in his praise makes anything of his first crusading venture. After witnessing a charter drawn up at Acre on 2 May 1241 he almost certainly sailed home on 3 May, when Earl Richard left the Holy Land. He arrived back in England in early March 1242. Within weeks he was off again, to attend Henry III in Gascony.<br>
<br>Longesp&eacute;e took the cross once more in May 1247, encouraged, apparently, by the example of Louis IX and the French. Much is known of his preparations for this crusade. One of his first acts against his crusade passage was a journey to Lyons to petition the pope for financial subsidy. After an audience with Innocent IV he was duly promised moneys from the redemption of English crusading vows on 6 June, but he experienced difficulties in securing the cash and further papal mandates were required in 1248 and 1249 to ensure payment of the 2000 marks eventually assigned to him. Money was raised in other ways, including the lease of four of his manors for four years from Michaelmas 1248 and the grant of a charter to his burgesses of Poole in return for 70 marks. His royal patron and cousin came to his assistance with further grants of money. He also took measures to settle disputes over property and to ensure the security of his interests and family during his absence. These included the drawing up of a will, duly confirmed by the king, the securing of a royal judicial protection, the appointment of executors and attorneys, and the concluding of a number of quitclaims and final concords. In 1249, for the good of his soul, he secured a grant from his mother, now abbess of Lacock, that he would be received into all spiritual benefits and prayers of the house in perpetuity, and it was probably around this time that he requested his body be buried at Lacock. With his mother's blessing he left England in 1249, an essoin on his behalf, taken at Wilton on 18 April, indicating that he had already left, though other evidence makes a date in late June or early July more likely. He joined the army of Louis IX at Damietta in Egypt, with around 200 English knights under his command, at some point in late 1249, certainly before the general advance up the Nile that began on 20 November. If Matthew Paris (uncorroborated) is to be believed, he had previously attended Louis. But following an ugly clash with certain French nobles, Robert, count of Artois, at their head, over the spoils from successful raids he had mounted out of Damietta, Longesp&eacute;e withdrew to Acre, having failed to secure justice from Louis in the matter. He returned to Damietta, according to Paris, only on Louis's prompting.<h2>
<a name="Afamousdeath"></a>A famous death</h2>It is upon the circumstances and manner of his death on crusade that Longesp&eacute;e's later, posthumous, fame rested. Following further reinforcement from France in October 1249, which may well have included Longesp&eacute;e and his knights, the strategic decision was taken to advance on Cairo. The army travelled slowly up the right bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile, until it was halted, unable to cross, on the north bank of the al-Bahr al-Saghir, opposite Mansourah where the bulk of the Egyptian forces were located. Eventually a local revealed the existence of an unguarded ford downstream, and on 8 February 1250 the vanguard, comprising the best cavalry and including the English under Longesp&eacute;e, crossed the ford at dawn led by Robert of Artois. Louis had instructed Robert to secure a bridgehead and advance no further, so that the main body of the army could cross safely. But Robert, rashly disobeying orders, insisted upon further attack, first into the Egyptian camp at Jadila and then into the town of Mansourah itself, though the vanguard was now isolated with no prospect of support. In the narrow streets of Mansourah, unable to manoeuvre, they were largely destroyed. As contemporaries, Muslim and Christian, appreciated, this proved to be the turning point of the entire crusade, so it is not surprising that the incident attracted much comment in Western sources, especially English and French ones, and that the attempt should be made to find a scapegoat for the crusade's failure.<br>
<br>Longesp&eacute;e was but one of those who died at Mansourah, but within twenty-five years he was emerging in English sources as a heroic figure, an ideal, exemplary crusader who fought to the death while the cowardly French, led by Robert of Artois, sought to flee the field, his arrogance and greed having doomed all of them. A legend rapidly developed: Longesp&eacute;e was transformed into an English &#145;national&#146; crusading hero, and his fame continued for a century and more. That the nature of his supposed last stand, and the deaths of his loyal English crusading companions, met with favour in English chivalric circles is amply proved by the Anglo-Norman poem in his and their honour, composed <i>c</i>.1275&#150;1300, and then copied. Matthew Paris, plainly, was exposed to earlier, oral analogues in the 1250s, and the diffusion of his works contributed to the making of Longesp&eacute;e's legend in other social circles as well.<br>
<br>Despite his wishes it seems that Longesp&eacute;e's bodily remains came to be buried in the cathedral at Acre, not at Lacock, and that his family and descendants made no attempt to translate them. The fine knightly effigy in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral is said, traditionally, to be of him, and produced on his mother's order, but the grounds for this are no more than romantic. He and his wife, Idonea, left one son, William (III) Longesp&eacute;e, and one daughter, Ela, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/894/', "James Audley")</script>.<br>
