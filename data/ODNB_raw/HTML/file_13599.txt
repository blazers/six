<span class="headword">Homes <span class="st"> [Holmes]</span>,  Nathaniel</span>  (1599&#150;1678), <span class="occ">Independent divine</span>, was born in Wiltshire, the son of the Revd George Homes of Kingswood. He matriculated as a fellow-commoner at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 11 April 1617, but wishing to study with John Prideaux (later bishop of Worcester), took his BA at Exeter College, where he graduated on 19 October 1620. He received his MA from Magdalen on 18 June 1623, his BD from Exeter on 27 June 1633, and the DD on 28 June 1637. During the period 1631 to 1642 he was rector of Whipsnade, Bedfordshire, and subsequently, in 1642, became rector at St Mary Staining in London, where he also held a lectureship at St Michael Bassishaw. By 1633 he had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1666), with whom he baptized at least two daughters at Whipsnade.<br>
<br>In co-operation with Henry Burton, Homes founded one of the first Independent gathered churches, which by 1643 was refusing to celebrate Easter. This came to the attention of John Vicars, who, in <span class="italic">The Schismatic Sifted</span>, accused Homes of excluding &#145;all his foresaid loving parishioners from Christian communion in their own parish church, except they would enter into a covenant with him&#146;  (Tolmie, 110). According to the well-known controversialist Thomas Edwards, Homes was active outside London and regularly attended to the needs of parishes between London and Dover &#145;going twice or thrice a year to visit&#146;  (Edwards, 72). He was nominated by the House of Lords on 30 October 1643 to be a member of the Westminster assembly, but he never sat in the assembly.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Homes maintained an avid interest in the last and final days of the world and produced a wealth of material containing his interpretations of the prophetic texts. His main concern was predicting the imminent downfall of the antichristian forces and the expected future glorious state of the church on earth. He adhered closely to Joseph Mede's millenarian interpretation of a spiritual reign of Christ through his saints, rather than the more radical interpretations that expected Christ to reign in person for a thousand years. His vision of a new world was forcefully expounded in his fast sermon before parliament in 1641, published as <span class="italic">The New World</span>. It was here that he linked his vision of a renewed society with a theory of congregationalism. As he declared, &#145;we, therefore, by new heavens and a new earth understand a new form of worship, religion in the expression thereof reformed, brought more close to the rule of the gospel, made more spiritual and heavenlike&#146;  (N. Homes, <span class="italic">The New World</span>, 1641, 7). Homes was very knowledgeable in Hebrew thought and his eschatological outlook was informed by the ancient Jewish doctrine that the world would last six thousand years and the seventh thousand would be the eternal sabbath. In a tract published in 1650 an opponent, Thomas Hall, denounced Homes's eschatological views and accused him of bringing &#145;forth the malignant fruit of Schisme in the Church, and Sedition in the State&#146;, and branded him <i>Chiliastorum Achilles</i>  (Hall, sig. *4<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Between 1650 and 1666 Homes's output of eschatological material was immense and in 1653 his tract <span class="italic">The Resurrection Revealed</span> was ordered to be presented to the council of state for its judgment. Joseph Caryll, who read the tract on behalf of the council before publication, subsequently qualified Homes's interpretation of the thousand-year reign of Christ upon earth by upbraiding those who expected a state of &#145;carnal liberty and worldly glory&#146; and praised Homes for showing &#145;the exceeding spiritualness and holiness of this state, to which, as none but the truly holy shall attain&#146;  (Homes, <span class="italic">Resurrection</span>, sig. A3<i>v</i>). Such an interpretation of the future millennium stands in stark contrast to that elaborated by, for example, the Fifth Monarchy Men, who desired significant changes to the economic, political, and social structures of society. During this time Homes's fear of social and political unrest is reflected in his attacks on precisely these radical religious sects and his calls for laws to be implemented against judicial astrology. The appearance of these &#145;wicked agents of Satan&#146; convinced Homes that the final days were imminent  (Homes, <span class="italic">Daemonologie</span>, 24). During the interregnum he continued to find favour with the government and in 1659 was appointed preacher to the council of state with lodgings in Whitehall.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Homes continued in his ministry and in 1661 he is found together with George Cockayne holding weekly meetings in an alehouse in Ivy Lane. Their congregational activity attracted the attention of the authorities and it was suggested, in a communication from a Mr Ashmole to Secretary Nicholas that it was likely that &#145;if their studies were searched papers of consequence might be found&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 128). Because of his adherence to congregationalism Homes did not comply with the provision of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662 and was subsequently ejected from his living at St Mary Staining. His wife died on 29 July 1666 and a son, Nathaniel, was buried on 29 August. The following year on 28 October, Homes married Sarah Lander at St James's, Duke's Place, London. On 16 May 1672 he took advantage of the declaration of indulgence and was granted a licence as a congregationalist to hold meetings at his house in Horseshoe Alley, Upper Moorfields. He died in June 1678 at St Giles Cripplegate, leaving bequests to Sarah and a daughter, Bithiah, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 2 July.<br>
