<span class="headword">Fowler,  Peter Howard</span>  (1923&#150;1996), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 27 February 1923 in Cambridge, the elder son and eldest of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33227/', "Sir Ralph Howard Fowler (1889&#150;1944)")</script>, mathematical physicist, and his wife, Eileen Mary (<i>d</i>. 1930), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35891/', "Ernest Rutherford, Baron Rutherford of Nelson")</script>. He had reached the age of only seven when his mother died after his young sister was born. By great good fortune Phyllida and Derek Cook, friends of his parents, moved into the Fowler home, Cromwell House in Trumpington. The four Fowler children (Peter, Elizabeth, Patrick, and Ruth) and the three Cook children (Lesley, Joanna, and Allison) grew up as one large, and by all accounts, happy family, with only eight years between the eldest and youngest child. Fowler's first exposure to formal education was at his nursery school, the Malting House, Cambridge. In his report for the winter term of 1927, Mr Slavson wrote:<blockquote>Peter's interest in fires still persists but we have succeeded both in extending that interest into other channels than merely bonfire and to divert it &hellip; Peter is outstandingly of an experimental and investigatory nature, but, at the present time, these tendencies are focused around fire. (Wolfendale, 178)</blockquote>All this was at the age of four! His traits of experimental skill which were to blossom in later life were already apparent.From an early age Fowler was fascinated by the weather, and especially clouds. This interest in meteorology could well have stemmed from his ancestor Luke Howard (1772&#150;1864), Quaker, meteorologist, and business man. Howard was credited with classifying cloud types&#151;cirrus, nimbus, cumulus, and stratus&#151;and inspiring Constable and indeed Goethe. At seven Fowler left the Malting House to board at his preparatory school, Summer Fields at Oxford. This was a deeply unhappy experience and in later life he vowed never to send his own children away at such a tender age. The choice of Winchester College as his public school was probably strongly influenced by his father, who had been a scholar there. He was a popular pupil, keenly interested in experimental science, an unusual attribute for Wykehamists at that time. His choice of Bristol University came about primarily because his father had a high regard for Professor Arthur Tyndall and the Bristol physics department. After two years of wartime Bristol he joined the Royal Air Force, became a radar officer, and, as he wrote, &#145;benefited from a course on radio physics from Professor Nevill Mott and others&#146;  (Wolfendale, 178). His time in the RAF was eventful. His notable success related to the &#145;Gee&#146; navigational aid. By 1944 the allies had developed this aid to guide bombers in the raids on the continent. The Germans, in their turn, constructed a powerful radio jammer to disable it. In a very short time Fowler, as a signals officer at Dover, devised a method of locating the jamming station in a manner not foreseen by the Germans. The station, which was located on a mountain at the Feldberg, near Frankfurt, was quickly destroyed.<br>
<br>In 1946 Fowler was released from the RAF and returned to Bristol to resume his undergraduate studies. By this time he had already shown an interest in cosmic rays. In a letter to his grandmother, Lady Rutherford, Tyndall wrote, in February 1947:<blockquote>shortly before he left, earlier in the war, my colleague Dr [Cecil] Powell had developed a new technique for studying particles from atomic nuclei by firing them into a photographic plate and measuring the minute tracks which showed up when the plate was developed. We had already given Peter, as an inquisitive student, an opportunity at that stage of measuring a few of these before he joined the RAF. His experience with photographic plates allowed him to participate in a series of experiments which led to three research papers. (Wolfendale, 179)</blockquote>All three papers were published in 1947 with Fowler as an author. This was after only one year of degree-level physics. After graduating in 1948, he was immediately appointed an assistant lecturer, and in 1951 he was appointed lecturer. He was extremely fortunate in falling for Rosemary Hempson Brown (<i>b</i>. 1925/6), whom he married on 23 July 1949. She was the daughter of Rear-Admiral George Herbert Hempson Brown and was herself a physicist, having obtained a first in physics in 1947. She became a research student in Cecil Powell's group and after Fowler graduated in 1948 the two worked together. She was happy to give up her research to provide him with the family life which he longed for after his years of boarding-school and the RAF. Their long and happy marriage was blessed with three daughters, who all read science at university.<br>
<br>Although he was very active in the Bristol work, Fowler arrived just too late to share in the glory of the discovery of the pion (by C. M. G. Lattes and others in 1947), the discovery that was to earn Powell the Nobel prize. Nevertheless, Fowler's activities were acknowledged by Powell in his Nobel address, and after her husband's death Mrs Powell gave the Fowlers his presentation copy of <span class="italic">The Prix Nobel</span> (1950). Fowler's forte was the detailed, and at times inspired, understanding of the emulsion technique. A significant discovery was that of the heavy tau meson, later termed the kaon (work carried out with his wife-to-be and others). This atomic particle decays into three pions and is now known to be one of the &#145;strange particles&#146;, the first of which were discovered in the elegant cloud-chamber experiments of G. D. Rochester and C. C. Butler in 1947. An early colleague of that period was D. H. Perkins, himself a distinguished nuclear emulsion physicist, and in 1959 they, with Powell, produced a major work: <span class="italic">The Study of Elementary Particles by the Photographic Method</span>. This book of over 600 pages became a bible for all those working in the field of cosmic rays&#151;and not just those using the emulsion technique. Fowler also worked with Perkins on studies of the possible use of negative pion beams for cancer therapy, a technique that was, then, ahead of its time.<br>
<br>The 1950s saw Fowler produce a steady stream of papers devoted to elementary particle physics using the emulsion technique. Balloon launches with increasingly massive payloads became commonplace. However, an interest in astrophysics was developing and this led to a number of discoveries, including the demonstration that very light atomic nuclei in the cosmic radiation come from the fragmentation of heavier nuclei on collision with the nuclei of gas in the gas between the stars. From September 1956 to June 1957 Fowler was visiting professor in the University of Minnesota, where heavy nuclei in the cosmic radiation had been originally discovered. In 1958 he was offered a permanent appointment by the University of Minnesota&#151;as a full professor&#151;but what turned out to be a minor health problem prevented him from taking up the post. Fowler's research work was recognized by the University of Bristol in 1958 by the award of a DSc and in 1961 by his promotion to reader. Election to the Royal Society followed in 1964. An honour which gave him, and many others, particular pleasure, was his appointment as Royal Society research professor in the same year.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s Fowler had become interested in the gas-scintillation process as yet another technique to use in his pursuit of the heavy primary cosmic rays. After development work, and a balloon-borne instrument, a detector was made for the last all-British satellite, Ariel VI. Ariel VI was launched on 24 May 1979 and the Bristol detector accumulated very significant data on the abundance of the heavy primary cosmic rays. The analysis of the data took many years, but the results turned out to be both exciting and unexpected, not least the presence of very heavy nuclei. It was with these nuclei (having charge Z &gt; 70) that Fowler's name came to be identified; here, an exotic mechanism transcending the standard model had to be postulated. Mention should also be made of his work following the Chernobyl disaster on 26 April 1986. There were many British students reading Russian and studying in Russia at the time, mostly in the vicinity of Kiev, and thus potentially at risk. Bristol was much involved and Fowler's knowledge of radiation and meteorology was of considerable value. Discussions between the University of Bristol, Fowler, and the Nuclear Radiological Protection Board resulted in the students' being brought home about three days after the disaster.<br>
<br>After retiring from the university in 1988, Fowler developed an association with Rolls-Royce, where he studied the temperature of turbine blades, work which was carried out with Peter Stewart, a Rolls-Royce engineer. The principle of the method was to determine the thermal broadening of the narrow resonance lines generated when epithermal neutrons are absorbed by specific metals. Alas, for financial reasons Rolls-Royce did not proceed with the necessary funding, but the technique was of great interest. Fowler was also chairman of the Herschel House Trust in Bath for many years, on behalf of the Royal Society. The house was where William Herschel made his celebrated discovery of the planet Uranus in 1781. In many ways Fowler and Herschel were alike&#151;both had great technical skill and both were fascinated by the cosmos.<br>
<br>Fowler was a great family man, devoted husband of Rosemary, and a proud father. As a younger man he had enjoyed cricket and squash, and in later life his principal relaxation, aided and abetted by Rosemary, was his garden, and their efforts were often rewarded by prizes at local flower shows. He died of heart failure at his home, 320 Canford Lane, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on 8 November 1996, and was buried in Bristol. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. A memorial service was held at Bristol Cathedral on 18 April 1997.<br>
