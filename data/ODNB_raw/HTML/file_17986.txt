<span class="headword">Mannyng,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [Robert Mannyng of Brunne]</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1338), <span class="occ">poet and historian</span>, was the author of two works, <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span> and <span class="italic">The Story of England</span> (this is his own title for the latter work, though it is often now referred to as <span class="italic">The Chronicle</span>), which are translations, adaptations, and expansions of Anglo-Norman moral and historical works respectively, put into English for those who knew no French. <span class="italic">The Medytacyuns of the Soper of Oure Lorde Jhesu</span>, a translation of Bonaventure sometimes attributed to Mannyng, is probably not by him.<br>
<br>The &#145;Brunne&#146; (that is, &#145;brook&#146;) of Mannyng's name is usually taken to be modern Bourne, in Lincolnshire, a likelihood strengthened by the manuscript  (LPL, MS 131) which names him (albeit in a later hand) as &#145;Robert de Brunne iuxta Depynge&#146;, presumably a reference to Deeping Fen or Market Deeping, only a few miles from Bourne. However, a minority opinion sees him as a Yorkshireman, originally from Nunburnham (recorded as Brunne in 1280), near York. The northern dialect of the Yale manuscript of <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span> is very close to that of the Petyt manuscript of <span class="italic">The Story of England</span>. The many allusions in his writings to Gilbertine masters and priories suggest that Mannyng himself was most probably a Gilbertine canon, perhaps a master of novices, though no record confirms this connection. References in his two works provide further evidence for his movements, and for the stages of his career.<br>
<br>Thus in <span class="italic">The Story of England</span> Mannyng says that he attended the &#145;commencement&#146;, or degree feast in Cambridge, in honour of Alexander Bruce, with Alexander's brothers Thomas and Robert (the latter being the future king of Scots) also in attendance; perhaps Mannyng was studying in Cambridge, possibly in the period 1298&#150;1302, although there is no record of his being a student there. Then in his prologue to <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span> Mannyng greets all Christians &#145;under sun&#146;, the good people of Brunne, and especially the Gilbertine community of Sempringham in Lincolnshire. He there records that he began <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span> in 1303, when Dan Felyp (Philip Burton) was master of the Gilbertines, at which time he was himself exactly 6 miles from Sempringham, usually taken to refer to his supposed birthplace, Bourne, in Lincolnshire (&#145;Brunnewake&#146; in the Dulwich manuscript; a minority opinion suggests that the Folger manuscript reading, &#145;Bringwake&#146;, might be a corruption of &#145;Brig Dike&#146;, or Bridge End (Holland Bridge), about 6 miles north-east of Sempringham, where there was a Gilbertine priory, St Saviour's, essentially a cell of Sempringham.) He relates that he was fifteen years (perhaps 1302&#150;1317) with Dan John of Camelton (Hamilton) and Dan John of Clinton (Glinton). Finally, Mannyng places himself at the Gilbertine priory at Sixhills, Lincolnshire, at the time when he finishes <span class="italic">The Story of England</span>, on 15 May 1338. There are no later references to him or by him.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span> is Mannyng's reaction to the call for yearly confessions for all Christians made by the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, and has been described as representing &#145;a development in the whole technique of confession and the parish priest's role therein&#146;  (Bennett, 460). The work has a strong homiletic tone to it throughout. Simultaneously a translation, adaptation, and expansion of the Anglo-Norman <span class="italic">Manuel des p&eacute;ch&eacute;s</span>, <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span> is Mannyng's masterpiece, characterized by charming retellings of old <i>exempla</i> from French and Latin moral treatises, and by its author's often traditional moral commentaries on the theological topics examined, commentaries that are leavened by his own amusing and amused, occasionally pedantic, consideration of the human predicament. The work is a guide to confession, an encouragement to &#145;shewe&#146; sin  (MS H, line 5), but is also, and just as importantly, a guide to help one avoid, or &#145;eschewe&#146;, sin  (MS D, line 5), once the individual (a varied audience is frequently addressed directly) understands sin's true nature. Frightening and sobering descriptions, in the stories and in their visions of hell, of the eternal and terrible suffering of those who commit the major sins, must have had their intended effect on at least some of the medieval readers of, or listeners to, this work. Mannyng's collection of tales, with their overriding moral concern, provided a model for such later collections as Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> and Gower's <span class="italic">Confessio amantis</span>. It has been suggested that the early audiences of the <span class="italic">Confessio</span> would have recognized it immediately, from its form as a collection of <i>exempla</i> sharing the same verse metre, as a parody of <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span>, a free verse translation and adaptation from the Anglo-Norman <span class="italic">Manuel</span>, consists of over 12,630 lines of octosyllabic rhyming couplets, with occasional shorter lines. It contains an additional thirteen tales of Mannyng's own. A short prologue is followed by anecdotes, illustrative <i>exempla</i> and social and moral commentary, designed for a popular regional audience, organized according to the ten commandments, the seven deadly sins (about half of the poem), sacrilege, the seven sacraments, the twelve points of shrift, and the twelve graces of shrift; Mannyng omits book 1 of the <span class="italic">Manuel</span>, containing the articles of the faith, and translates only about half of the 8500 lines in the sections of the <span class="italic">Manuel</span> that he does include. Like the <span class="italic">Manuel</span>, he makes particular use of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Bede, Gregory the Great's <span class="italic">Dialogues</span>, and the lives of the fathers. His best-known tales include that of the dancers of Colbeck; the witch and her cow-sucking bag (the bag would not work for the bishop because he did not believe in it); and the story of the hermit and his bear, the latter being slain by followers of the hermit Euticius, out of envy of his fellow hermit Florens, who had been enjoying miraculous comfort, companionship, and sheep-herding, all provided by the polite and accommodating bear.<br>
<br>There are twelve extant manuscripts of <span class="italic">Handlyng Synne</span>, none of them complete or entirely satisfactory. Among the most important are the four earlier versions, some of them in later manuscripts: Yale University, Beinecke Library, MS Osborn a.2, once complete but now lacking more than 3000 lines; CUL, MS Ii.4.9, an excerpt of about 2800 lines, containing the ten commandments only; London, Dulwich College, MS XXIV, a fragment of 2894 lines, which has the prologue and most of the ten commandments, stopping with a catchword; and the Vernon manuscript, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng.poet. a.1, which has only 919 lines, &#145;Of the sacrament of the altar&#146;. Also very important are the three almost complete manuscripts (two of them base manuscripts of editions) of about 12,638 lines, which represent a later (even though dated earlier in some cases) &#145;revised&#146; version of the work: Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 415; BL, Harley MS 1701; and Washington, Folger Shakespeare Library, MS Folger V.b.236.<br>
<br>Mannyng's only other known work, his metrical <span class="italic">Story of England</span>, is one of the best-known Middle English chronicles. It has two parts: the first, 16,638 four-stress lines in rhyming couplets, consists of a prologue, the story of Noah's flood, a summary of the Troy legend, and the history of Britain from its founding by Brutus to the death of the last British king, Cadwalader, in 689, followed by the arrival of the Saxons and their conquest of Britain, with substantial Arthurian material. The second part, 8387 lines of six-stress lines of rhyming couplets, with some internal rhyme, continues from 689 to 1307 and the death of Edward I. It also contains references to Havelok the Dane, and to Gwenllian daughter of Llywelyn, who lived with the Gilbertines for her last fifty-four years. Mannyng's primary sources for <span class="italic">The Story of England</span>, which, he explains, avoids fancy poetic forms, so that he will be plain and understandable, are the Anglo-Norman <span class="italic">Roman de Brut</span> of Wace, and the chronicle of Peter Langtoft, but he adds material from other sources. He is writing to delight and instruct &#145;symple men&#146;, so that they can learn which kings were wise and which were foolish. The final product, among the best-known chronicles in Middle English, shows his careful scholarly tendencies and interests, and a willingness to conduct a wide-ranging search for his material. He would gladly copy more of his <span class="italic">Story</span>, he says at the end, if there were more to copy.<br>
<br>Robert Mannyng of Brunne communicated his moral, religious, and historical concerns to fellow Christians of all conditions through his extraordinarily vigorous, fast-paced, often dramatic narrative skills, even as he avoided the ironies and complexities which are now valued in narrative, so that the moral points of his <i>exempla</i> would be clear. These narrative skills, and the energy and intelligence that he brought to his large tasks, provided important new models in English for later fourteenth-century writers who are now more admired and better known&#151;at the moral level, tactful instruction intended to move the reader or hearer to change for the better; at the narrative level, masterful story-telling; and at the structural level, moral instruction and tales within a larger framework, all three levels handled with consummate skill.<br>
