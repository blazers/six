<span class="headword">Heywood,  Samuel</span>  (1753&#150;1828), <span class="occ">judge and author</span>, was born on 8 October 1753 at Liverpool, the eldest of four children of Benjamin Heywood (1731&#150;1795), merchant, and his wife, Phoebe (<i>b</i>. 1729), daughter of Samuel Ogden of Liverpool. He was educated at the dissenting academy at Warrington, where the prevailing religious ethos tended towards Unitarianism, and subsequently at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. At Trinity Hall he incurred the displeasure of the college authorities, and in particular the future bishop Samuel Hallifax, by absenting himself from Anglican worship in the college chapel. In order to avoid the subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> required on graduation at Cambridge, he did not take a degree. Making the law his career, he studied at the Inner Temple, was called to the bar in 1778, and became a serjeant-at-law in 1794. He practised extensively on the northern circuit, where he became friendly with John Scott, the future Lord Eldon, and John Lee. His vehement dissenting and whig principles were amusingly recounted by Eldon, who quoted Lee as saying:&#145;Well, Sam &hellip; thou art, in Truth a Dissenter! dissenting more than anybody I ever knew!&#151;for thou agreest with nobody about any thing!&#146;  (Lincoln and McEwen, 112).<br>
<br>Heywood married Susanna (<i>bap</i>. 1758, <i>d</i>. 1822), the daughter of John Cornwall, merchant, of London, at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 1 January 1781. They had one son and four daughters; only their daughter Ann, who married Colonel Granville Eliot, survived Heywood. The debates over the attempts to secure repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> in the late 1780s spurred Heywood into a powerful attack on the system of religious tests which were designed to exclude dissenters from public office. This took the form of <span class="italic">The Right of Protestant Dissenters to a Compleat Toleration Asserted</span> (1787; 2nd edn, 1789), a scholarly history of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> infused with a radical polemic against the Anglican hegemony. Writing under the pseudonym A Layman, he concluded:<blockquote>We may congratulate a country on the wonderful uniformity which takes place as to the employments within this Act, when not even a bug can be destroyed within the purlieus of the royal household but by the hallowed fingers of a communicant; nor a post letter conveyed to any part of the kingdom by horses belonging to a Protestant Dissenter. (p. 76)</blockquote>In 1790 he took his arguments further in <span class="italic">High Church Politics</span>, in which he blamed a &#145;high church party&#146;, and Bishop Samuel Horsley in particular, for bringing a new climate of intolerance into public life.<br>
<br>His opinions and his prowess in expressing them brought Heywood to the centre of radicalism in religion and whiggism in politics. He supported, and was a trustee of, the Unitarian chapel opened by Theophilus Lindsey in Essex Street, London. He became a friend of Charles James Fox, and contributed material to the latter's <span class="italic">History of the Early Part of the Reign of James II</span> (1808) and, in his <span class="italic">Vindication of Mr Fox's History</span> (1811), defended his late friend's book against the strictures of the Pittite George Rose. He was consulted by Charles Grey, Lord Howick, in 1807 over the Catholic relief (and its possible extension to dissenters) proposed by the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;. It was through Grey's influence that Heywood was made a judge of the Carmarthen circuit in 1807 and hence became one of the very few professed dissenters to hold national office under the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>  (Ditchfield). He already enjoyed the reputation of an expert on electoral law, publishing <span class="italic">Digest of the Law Concerning County Elections</span> in 1790 and <span class="italic">Digest of the Law Respecting Borough Elections</span> in 1797.<br>
<br>Heywood was taken ill with &#145;paralysis&#146;&#151;probably a stroke&#151;while on circuit at Haverfordwest in August 1828. He died at Tenby on 11 September and was buried at Bristol on 19 September. He lived just long enough to see the repeal of the sacramental provisions of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> which he had so sharply denounced. His career, like that of his friend John Lee, symbolizes the political alliance between whigs and dissenters, and the rising social status of the legal profession.<br>
