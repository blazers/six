<span class="headword">Bunting,  Sidney Percival</span>  (1873&#150;1936), <span class="occ">political activist in South Africa</span>, was born at 14 Oakley Square, Somers Town, St Pancras, London, on 29 June 1873, the second of four children of the nonconformist social activists <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32171/', "Percy William Bunting (1836&#150;1911)")</script> and his wife, Mary Hyett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lidgett (1840&#150;1919). Jabez Bunting, paramount figure of early nineteenth-century Wesleyan Methodism, was his great-grandfather. Bunting's father, a barrister who was knighted in 1908, was a prominent figure in the Liberal Party and editor of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>; his mother, who was involved in moral purity campaigns, undertook social work among working-class girls and women. Bunting absorbed his parents' values of moral rectitude and service to others and carried them with him throughout his life.<br>
<br>Highly intelligent, musically gifted, and disciplined, Bunting excelled in classics, winning a scholarship first to University College School and later to St Paul's School. He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, as a classics demy in 1892, gaining firsts in classical moderations (1894) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1896), and winning the chancellor's Latin essay prize (1897). But his expectations that academic success would lead to a scholarly career were disappointed, as he narrowly missed election to a fellowship at Magdalen.<br>
<br>Back in London, Bunting followed his father into law, passing the final solicitors' examination on 24 November 1899. In that year he also helped launch the Oxford and Cambridge Musical Club, the viola being his instrument of choice. A believer in empire, he sailed in May 1900 for South Africa, where he served as a lieutenant in the colonial irregular forces during the South African War. He remained in South Africa after the war, settling in Johannesburg and establishing himself in a legal career. He joined the Rand Club, launched the Johannesburg Musical Society in 1902, and, in his free time, wrote musical reviews. He took the degree of LLB through private study, passing the exams of the Cape of Good Hope University in 1906. His maternal family had land in Natal and, together with his cousin John Lidgett, he convinced the family to establish a wattle plantation. The Lidgetton Land Company was formed in 1907, with Bunting as a director.<br>
<br>Through his social networks, and particularly his friend Wilfred Wybergh, commissioner of mines in the Transvaal, Bunting became drawn into labour politics. In 1910 he joined the South African Labour Party, which excluded blacks from membership. His political involvement accelerated after his father's death in 1911, which perhaps left him feeling freer to pursue his political interests. The turbulent white mineworkers' strike of July 1913 was a transforming experience. He was apparently at the Rand Club on 5 July when troops shot protesters and pedestrians in front of the club, an act of wanton violence which shattered his belief in the moral legitimacy of the state. From that time on he moved increasingly leftward in his politics. In September 1914, following the outbreak of the war in Europe, he was one of a small minority in the Labour Party that formed the War-on-War League within the party; a year later anti-war critics broke from the Labour Party and formed the International Socialist League. By 1915 Bunting was urging his fellow socialists to turn their attention to the plight of black workers. In contrast to many South African Labour Party stalwarts, his rapid orientation to black labour was possible because of his lack of roots in the white labour movement, but his concern for black workers put him on the margins of the all-white socialist movement. Marriage on 22 December 1916 to his fellow socialist Rebecca Notlowitz (1888&#150;1971), a Lithuanian Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute;e, left him further from the conventional norms of his social class.<br>
<br>Bunting became notorious in respectable white society after his arrest for his role in the African municipal workers' strike of June 1918. Believing in the Russian Revolution, he devoted increasing amounts of time to politics. He edited the International Socialist League's paper with an exhortatory style full of biblical allusions and Latin maxims. The &#145;bitter cry of outcast London&#146; that he had imbibed as a youth in his parents' Methodist circles became in <span class="italic">The International</span> the &#145;bitter cry of outcast Africa&#146;.<br>
<br>In line with the Comintern's dictates, Bunting played a leading role in launching the virtually all-white Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) in July 1921. He and his wife attended the fourth Comintern Congress in Russia in November&#150;December 1922, where he worked on how to apply the Comintern's united front policy to South Africa's racially divided conditions. On his return to South Africa he resigned from the Lidgetton Land Company, no longer able to reconcile his communist politics with his directorship of a plantation. But he continued using his profits from the wattle estate to subsidize his political activities.<br>
<br>Bunting interpreted the Comintern's Bolshevization policy as a signal to recruit black workers. Largely through his efforts the CPSA became overwhelmingly black in composition. In 1927&#150;8 the Comintern moved to impose the &#145;native republic&#146; thesis, which called for the establishment of a black republic independent of the British empire. Bunting felt that the thesis shifted attention from the working class to the peasantry and that the call for a black republic would alienate white workers. When he and his wife attended the Sixth Comintern Congress in July&#150;August 1928 they were cold-shouldered. Chastened, Bunting accepted the thesis and facilitated its adoption by the CPSA. But his initial forceful opposition made him a marked man in the Comintern's eyes.<br>
<br>Eager to prove his commitment, Bunting decided to contest the rural Thembuland seat in the national election of June 1929. He and his companions were shadowed by the police and charged with contravening the <span class="roman">Native Administration Act</span>. He lost the election but won enough votes to keep his deposit. He also won his case on appeal. The matter reached the house of assembly in August, where General Smuts called on the government to tighten the law to prevent further communist campaigns in African areas.<br>
<br>The Comintern's new line hit the CPSA with full force in 1930&#150;31. Bunting's &eacute;lite background and moralistic attitudes made him the key target of political rivalry and jealousy. &#145;Buntingism&#146; became a term of opprobrium. In September 1931 he and other leading communists were expelled. Devastated, he tried unsuccessfully to appeal against his expulsion.<br>
<br>In 1933 Bunting gave up his legal practice on medical advice. In any case, the practice earned little income as his clients were mainly poor Africans. Needing to feed his family, he landed a job in the orchestra of the African Theatres' Trust. This entailed touring the country, not easy for a man of his age with health problems, and in February 1936 he found work as a caretaker. He died of a rupture of arteries in the brain at the Johannesburg General Hospital on 25 May 1936, having suffered a stroke&#151;his second&#151;on the previous day. He was cremated at Braamfontein crematorium, Johannesburg, on 27 May. His wife survived him, along with their two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77029/', "Arthur Hugh Bunting (1917&#150;2002)")</script>, a noted crop scientist who held a chair at the University of Reading, and Brian Percy Bunting (1920&#150;2008), a journalist who became a leader of the South African Communist Party.<br>
<br>Bunting's life demonstrates that individual members of the imperial diaspora could play a radicalizing role. His political significance lies in transforming the demography of the CPSA, a legacy that has had major political implications for the trajectory of South African politics.<br>
