<span class="headword">Mitford,  Unity Valkyrie  Freeman-</span>  (1914&#150;1948), <span class="occ">Nazi sympathizer</span>, was born on 8 August 1914 at 49 Victoria Road, Kensington, London, the fourth of six exceptionally spirited daughters of David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford (1878&#150;1958), who succeeded as second Baron Redesdale of the second creation in 1916. Her mother was Sydney (1880&#150;1963), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32005/', "Thomas Gibson Bowles")</script>. She was chiefly educated at home by governesses. &#145;Her immense, baleful eyes, large, clumsy limbs, dead straight tow-coloured hair, sometimes in neat pig-tails but more often flowing loose, gave her the appearance of a shaggy Viking or Little John&#146;, according to her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60652/', "Jessica Mitford")</script>  (Mitford, <span class="italic">Hons</span>, 16). This <i>farouche</i> child, however, matured into a bold, generous, quick-witted, and amusing young woman. She was incapable of deviousness or dissimulation: her preferred occupation, she averred, would be gangster or airman; her besetting sin was boastfulness. She was an avid but discriminating reader, who memorized reams of esoteric poetry and created intricate collages.<br>
<br>In June 1933 Unity Mitford joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96364', "British Union of Fascists")</script>, which had been organized in the previous year by Sir Oswald Mosley, who later married her sister Diana [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92691/', "Mosley, Diana (1910&#150;2003)")</script>]. Following Hitler's accession to power in 1933 she toured Germany in the company of Diana and the young tory politicians Nigel Birch (afterwards Lord Rhyl) and Victor Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke. She settled in Munich in May 1934 in order to learn the German language. By reserving a nightly table in the Osteria Bavaria inn, where the F&uuml;hrer often dined, and staring at him, she contrived a meeting on 9 February 1935: &#145;the most wonderful and beautiful day of my life&#146;  (Moyne and Guinness, 368). Thereafter she met Hitler on 140 occasions before the outbreak of war in 1939&#151;finding him always sweet and unaffected. Her veneration of him was so absolute that she became a blindly fervent devotee of his political creed.<br>
<br>On 22&#150;23 June 1935 Mitford was guest of honour at the Nazi summer solstice celebrations where she addressed 200,000 people. Soon afterwards her short personal manifesto of antisemitism was published in <span class="italic">Der St&uuml;rmer</span>. Thereafter, as a British peer's daughter, she was often photographed accompanying Nazi leaders at rallies, Bayreuth festivals, and the Olympic games of 1936. She and her father joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, and attended the Nuremberg rally of 1938 together with Robert Byron: Lord Redesdale, said Byron, &#145;treated the Nazi Party Conference as though it were a house party to which five hundred thousand rather odd and unexpected guests had turned up&#146;  (Ritchie, 38). Mosley described her as &#145;young, ingenuous, full of enthusiasm, in a way stage-struck by the glamour and panoply of the national socialist movement and the mass admiration of Hitler&#146;  (O. Mosley, 368). The fixity of her admiration for Nazidom was unreasonable: her conduct and conversation became exaggerated. She saluted the postmistress of Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, with raised hand, &#145;<i>Heil</i> <i>Hitler</i>!&#146;, collected Nazi trophies, chanted blackshirt rhymes about Jews, and agreed with her friend Julius Streicher that Jews should be made to eat grass. However, she had no influence on the Nazi inner circle, and stories that she was Hitler's mistress, or that she aspired to marry him, were untrue. She had love affairs with Erik Widemann, a member of the SS, and with Janos Almasy.<br>
<br>In Britain, Mitford's antics were reported in popular newspapers. Her influence, though, was negligible. Her ardent defence of the Austrian <i>Anschluss</i> sent on 5 March 1938 to Winston Churchill did not sway him; but after she reached Vienna on the same day as the F&uuml;hrer (14 March), Hitler declared: &#145;They said England would be there to stop me, but the only English person I saw was on my side&#146;  (Moyne, 410). In May 1938 she provoked arrest in Czechoslovakia by wearing her swastika badge.<br>
<br>Having often threatened suicide if Britain and Germany went to war, Unity Mitford shot herself with a pistol in the English Garden at Munich on 3 September 1939. She was unconscious for two months. German surgeons saved her life but were unable to extract the bullet from her brain. On Hitler's instructions she was moved to Switzerland, and then returned to England on 3 January 1940. Her mental and physical powers were impaired, and she lived under the unwavering protection of her mother. James Lees-Milne visited her in 1944 and reported that she: &#145;has become rather plain and fat, and says that she weighs 13&frac12; stone. Her mind is that of a sophisticated child, and she is still very amusing in that Mitford manner&#146;  (Lees-Milne, 146&#150;7). She was saved from the dismal wreckage of her fantasies when the bullet wound in her brain became inflamed: she died unmarried, of meningitis, on 28 May 1948, at the West Highland Cottage Hospital, Oban. Her burial on 1 June was at Swinbrook, Oxfordshire. She is satirized as Eugenia Malmains in the novel <span class="italic">Wigs on the Green</span> (1935) by her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31450/', "Nancy Mitford")</script>.<br>
