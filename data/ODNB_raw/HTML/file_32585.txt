<span class="headword">Coupland, Sir  Reginald</span>  (1884&#150;1952), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in London on 2 August 1884, the only surviving child of Sidney Coupland (1849&#150;1930), consulting physician and lecturer at the Middlesex Hospital, London, and his wife, Bessie, daughter of Thomas Potter of Great Bedwin, Wiltshire. An elder brother died in early childhood, and Coupland himself suffered frequent ill health. A contemporary later recalled that he was &#145;always much taken up with his own health, and indeed with all his own concerns&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Nov 1952). He was educated privately in Brighton and at Winchester College, where he edited a youthful collection of essays and poems, <span class="italic">Horae iuventutis</span> (1903). He then studied classics at New College, Oxford, where Alfred Zimmern was one of his tutors. As an undergraduate he was noted as an ardent Liberal&#151;as was his father, who was a close friend and supporter of Stopford Brooke&#151;but he also discovered, and was much influenced by, the idea of fellowship put forward by John Ruskin and the early William Morris. He obtained a second class in classical honour moderations in 1905 and a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1907. On the strength of his examination papers he was elected to a fellowship and lectureship in ancient history at Trinity College, Oxford, later the same year, and started work on an unpublished history of ancient Greece, in which he argued that the impermanence of the Greek city states was largely the result of their failure to combine.<br>
<br>Coupland's career was transformed by his coming into contact with Lionel Curtis, who was Beit lecturer in colonial history at Oxford from 1912 to 1913. Curtis persuaded Coupland to succeed him as Beit lecturer, and to join the Round Table, which had been formed as an imperial &#145;ginger group&#146; in 1910. Coupland subsequently maintained a lifelong connection with the group, editing its eponymous journal from 1917 to 1919 and 1939 to 1941, and contributing many anonymous articles. On the eve of the First World War he was employed by Curtis to write the volume of <span class="roman">Round Table Studies</span> relating to Canada. A proof version (dated 1920) survives, but again the work was unpublished. During the war Coupland remained in Oxford, having been declared ineligible for national service on medical grounds. In 1915 he published an edition of <span class="italic">The War Speeches of William Pitt the Younger</span>. This was reissued, with a preface by Winston Churchill, in 1940.<br>
<br>Some surprise was expressed when in 1920 Coupland was elected to succeed H. E. Egerton as Beit professor and professorial fellow of All Souls College. In his inaugural lecture Coupland admitted his lack of the usual professorial stock-in-trade, but asked to &#145;be judged not by what he has done but by what he means to do&#146;  (R. Coupland, <span class="italic">The Empire in these Days</span>, 1935, 6). His tenure of the Beit chair, which lasted until 1948, was indeed marked by a steady output of books, many of them published to public and critical acclaim. His first was <span class="italic">Wilberforce</span> (1923), a life which reflected his long-held belief that &#145;personality is the really interesting thing in history&#146;  (Symonds, 53). <span class="italic">Wilberforce</span> was followed by <span class="italic">Raffles</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Kirk on the Zambesi</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Livingstone's Last Journey</span> (1945), in each of which Coupland developed his theme of the moral basis of British rule, based on imperial trusteeship and the evolution of the empire into a Commonwealth of self-governing nations. An interest in the problem of nationality was reflected in <span class="italic">The Quebec Act</span> (1925), a study which emphasized the far-sightedness of British policy in Canada. His <span class="italic">The American Revolution and the British Empire</span> (1930) argued that the British empire had been transformed in the half-century after the American War of Independence, through the rise of trusteeship, anti-slavery, and free trade. He wrote the book in order to help Americans in particular to &#145;begin to look at [the empire] from a new angle&#146;  (May, 236). The theme of trusteeship was further explored in what Coupland considered to be his most important historical work, <span class="italic">East Africa and its Invaders</span> (1938), a detailed study of east African history from antiquity to the death of Seyyid Said, and <span class="italic">The Exploitation of East Africa</span> (1939), which continued the story from 1856 until the establishment of the British protectorate in 1890.<br>
<br>Coupland was instrumental in securing the training of colonial service probationers at Oxford. Sir Ralph Furse later recalled that &#145;one of the most capable officers in the service&#146; had told him that Coupland's lectures had been &#145;the greatest help&#146;: they had &#145;sustained his faith &hellip; and &hellip; been a touchstone by which to judge the stream of criticism &hellip; directed in recent years at British colonial policy and the men who execute it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Nov 1952). Coupland also played a key role in setting up the school of philosophy, politics, and economics, for which he devised the special subject on the political structure of the British empire. He was involved in the negotiations leading to the founding of Nuffield College, Oxford, of which he was a professorial fellow from 1939 to 1950. Less successfully, he was also associated with the schemes for a school of government or of African studies put forward by his Round Table colleagues. An abiding interest at Oxford was the Ralegh Club, founded by Curtis to provide a forum for the discussion of imperial problems. Under Coupland's professorship, the club attracted as speakers many of the empire's most distinguished proconsuls, statesmen, and critics.<br>
<br>Coupland played a role on a wider stage as a member of the royal commission on the superior services in India, appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Lee of Fareham in June 1923. This reported in March 1924 in favour of increasing Indianization of the civil service in India. For his services on this commission, Coupland was appointed CIE in 1928. He worked under Lord Peel as an adviser to the Burma round-table conference in 1931, and again as a member of the royal commission on Palestine, appointed in July 1936. Coupland was widely believed to have played a key role in the commission, and to have drafted its report, published in July 1937, which concluded that the Arab&#150;Jewish conflict was intractable, and that the only lasting solution would be partition, the forcible transfer of population, and the retention of a buffer zone by Britain. The British government's rejection of such a policy following the report of the Palestine partition commission, under Sir John Woodhead, was a source of great disappointment to him.<br>
<br>In February 1941 Coupland was persuaded by his old Round Table colleague Leo Amery, now secretary of state for India, to conduct a study of the Indian constitutional question, under the auspices of Nuffield College. When Sir Stafford Cripps arrived in India on his mission of March to April 1942, Coupland served on his staff. He subsequently published a sketch, <span class="italic">The Cripps Mission</span> (1942), and a more substantial study in three volumes, <span class="italic">The Indian Problem, 1833&#150;1935</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Indian Politics, 1936&#150;1942</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">The Future of India</span> (1943). Coupland was one of the first British writers to discuss seriously the idea of partition, but he came down in favour of a loose confederation of regions, formed by groups of provinces and princely states. He again put forward this solution in <span class="italic">India: a Re-Statement</span> (1945).<br>
<br>Coupland was appointed KCMG in recognition of his many services in 1944. He retired from the Beit chair in 1948, and was succeeded by Vincent Harlow. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1948 and a fellow of All Souls in 1952. Meanwhile he had started work on a multi-volume study of nationalism in the British empire. He handed the manuscript of the first volume to his publisher on 5 November 1952. The following day he died suddenly, as he embarked at Southampton on a fact-finding voyage to South Africa. He was buried in the chapel of All Souls College, Oxford, on 12 November 1952. He was unmarried. His <span class="italic">Welsh and Scottish Nationalism</span> was published posthumously, to wide acclaim, in 1954.<br>
<br>Coupland was small, slight, and in later years stooped, with a quiet voice and an earnest demeanour. Nevertheless, his contemporaries remembered his lively lectures and his entertaining company. His views often irritated those who did not share his own belief in the moral rectitude of British rule. When Mahatma Gandhi addressed the Ralegh Club in 1931, Coupland lectured him on the need for patience and co-operation. Gandhi replied that he was only a peasant, not a professor, but that this was not how he understood America and Ireland to have won their independence  (Symonds, 54). Eric Williams, later prime minister of Trinidad, wrote that Coupland was &#145;the most tedious of British historians&#146;  (Williams, 154). This was unfair. Coupland's books were expertly crafted, and appreciated by a wide audience. He was a fluent writer, with a flair for narrative and an exceptional geographical and historical scope. Even in his own lifetime many of his views came to be seen as outdated, but his interpretations of east African and Indian history in particular have remained influential, as the most coherent exposition of a particular point of view.<br>
