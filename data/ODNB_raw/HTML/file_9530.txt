<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzalan,  Henry</span>, twelfth earl of Arundel  (1512&#150;1580), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 23 April 1512, the only son of William Fitzalan, eleventh earl of Arundel (<i>c</i>.1476&#150;1544), magnate, and his second wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. in or before 1485, <i>d</i>. 1552), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21935/', "Henry Percy, fourth earl of Northumberland (c.1449&#150;1489)")</script>, magnate, and his wife, Maud. He had a sister, Katherine Fitzalan. His father was close enough to the crown for Henry VIII to stand as godfather to Henry Fitzalan. Though holder of England's premier earldom, and perhaps the fourth richest earl, the eleventh earl of Arundel made little impact on national affairs. He was nominated on 23 April and installed on 25 June 1525 as a knight of the Garter (held by his own father and grandfather), but achieved this only through the intercession of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. He was the only lay peer to join the spirituals in opposing the bill in conditional restraint of annates in 1532, but then prudently absented himself from parliament, naming Boleyns as his proxies. In 1538 a papal report declared that Arundel was of &#145;great power, little wit, and less experience&#146;, while his son was &#145;young and lusty, of good wit, and likely to do well&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/2, no. 732).<h2>
<a name="Henriciancareer15271546"></a>Henrician career, 1527&#150;1546</h2>In his fifteenth year, according to his posthumous biography, Henry Fitzalan preferred to become page to the king rather than to Wolsey, knowing the latter &#145;to be but of a very lowe and base birth&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 12). Inadvertently this may have been a useful political decision, taken on typically snobbish grounds. He joined his father with the king at the Calais meeting with Fran&ccedil;ois I in September 1532. Before November he married Katherine (<i>b</i>. in or after 1509, <i>d</i>. 1542), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11561/', "Thomas Grey, second marquess of Dorset (1477&#150;1530)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret. They had one son, Henry, later Lord Maltravers (1538&#150;1556), and two daughters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47846/', "Jane Lumley (1537&#150;1578)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47847/', "Mary Howard, later duchess of Norfolk (1539/40&#150;1557)")</script>. The second part of the family marriage alliance proved abortive, however. Dorset's heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11535/', "Henry Grey, later third marquess of Dorset and duke of Suffolk (1517&#150;1554)")</script>, refused to marry Katherine Fitzalan. The exact stage at which the match was broken off is unclear, though Grey certainly provided a financial settlement. William Paget, first Baron Paget, when Suffolk fell in 1553, alleged that Suffolk's children were illegitimate because of a precontract to Katherine Fitzalan <i>per verba de praesenti</i>.<br>
<br>Fitzalan was summoned to parliament on 5 February 1534 during his father's lifetime under the subsidiary family title of Baron Maltravers or Mautravers. He was expected to make himself more useful than his father had done, for instance sitting four times to try peers in Henry's reign, while Arundel joined him only for the trial of Anne Boleyn on 15 May 1536 (although the earl should have had claims to consideration for the presiding office of high steward).<br>
<br>On 2 July 1540 Maltravers replaced Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle, as deputy of Calais, receiving a basic fee of &pound;300 per annum rather than &pound;100 per annum. He was reported to be &#145;a silent, reasoning, cunning man and a good judge&#146; but melancholic  (<span class="italic">The Lisle Letters</span>, ed. M. St C. Byrne, 6 vols., 1981, 6.160). He presided over several threatening border incidents, and was appropriately suspicious and &#145;not unliberall to winne intelligence&#146;: the privy council complained six months after his recall, &#145;since the earl of Arundel's coming from Calais, no espials' news out of France has been sent hither&#146; (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 13; <span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 19/1, no. 401). He had other problems besides melancholia: smallpox in summer 1543 and by late 1545 a &#145;quarteyne&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 18/1, no. 496, 20/2, no. 490).<br>
<br>By now, whatever his religious conservatism Maltravers was taking the opportunity to acquire former monastic property on favourable terms from the court of augmentations: in 1542 he offered &pound;1000 for his ancestral foundation of Arundel College but was allowed it for two-thirds of that sum. Lady Maltravers died on 1 May 1542. The king accepted his succession as twelfth earl of Arundel on 23 January 1544 as justifying his return to England. He was elected knight of the Garter on 24 April and installed on 18 May and in July joined the French campaign as marshal of the field under Charles Brandon, first duke of Suffolk. He served at the capture of Boulogne on 14 September, though the idea of his leading an assault seems to be an exaggeration.<br>
<br>During the invasion scare of summer 1545 Arundel acted as commissioner of array in the southern counties, then took charge of the western of three armies, covering Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. Assignment to Suffolk's new campaign in France was aborted by the duke's death on 24 August. Arundel, married on 19 December 1545 Mary (<i>d</i>. 1557), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77098/', "Sir John Arundell (c.1474&#150;1545)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41331/', "Arundell family (per. 1435&#150;1590)")</script>], landowner of Lanherne, Cornwall, and his second wife, Katherine, and widow of Robert Radcliffe, first earl of Sussex. They had no children.<h2>
<a name="Powerstrugglesontheprivycouncil15461553"></a>Power struggles on the privy council, 1546&#150;1553</h2>In July 1546 Henry, appreciative of service in France, made Arundel lord chamberlain and privy councillor. Arundel was a diligent privy councillor, attending two-thirds of the meetings to the end of Henry's reign, but was still too new to be named by the king as more than an assistant to his executors. He began to enjoy a significant political friendship with the principal secretary, Paget, and accompanied Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, and him on Henry's 1546 progress. This suggests that Hertford and Paget did not consider him too conservative, or at least not too friendly to the Howards or Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester. In an uncharacteristically meritocratic gesture of Arundel's, the year after being himself elected to the Garter, he cast a solitary vote for the commoner Paget.<br>
<br>Arundel was also active as lord chamberlain, producing a book of regulations and attempting to rescue the somewhat moribund office from its eclipse after subordination to the lord great master of the household. Henry died on 28 January 1547 and under Edward VI Arundel's duties soon tended to be usurped by Sir Michael Stanhope, Hertford's brother-in-law and supporter. He did, however, act as high constable at the coronation on 20 February 1547, as he did again in 1553 and 1558.<br>
<br>Arundel's reservations about the administration of Hertford, now duke of Somerset and lord protector, initially remained covert. He profited from the fall of Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley, by acquiring in 1549 his great mansion between the Strand and the Thames, henceforward renamed Arundel House, for a mere &pound;41. As enclosure disturbances spread into Sussex, Arundel was able to restore &#145;a quavering quiet&#146;, thinking it &#145;not convenient to reforme with the sworde&#146;, by providing &#145;aboundance of victuall&#146; and summary adjudications at his seat, Arundel Castle (Pocock, 14; Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 14). This was a notably more impressive performance than that of landowners in East Anglia and the south-west who could not contain the rebellions by exercising traditional methods of good lordship. Whether Arundel's social conservatism later inspired his eccentric opposition to the 1563 bill against vagabondage is uncertain.<br>
<br>By September 1549 Arundel and Thomas Wriothesley, first earl of Southampton, &#145;men of their owne nature circumspect and slow, but at the time discountenanced and discontent&#146;, joined John Dudley, earl of Warwick, in trying to interest Princess Mary in Somerset's dismissal and then in achieving it without her on 13 October  (J. Hayward, <span class="italic">The Life and Raigne of King Edward the Sixth</span>, ed. B. L. Beer, 1993, 115). Arundel was one of the six peers appointed to attend Edward, and also one of the group who gained over &pound;6000 each through manipulation of the coinage. Warwick was also said to have proposed giving Somerset's post of lord great chamberlain to Arundel, allowing Paget to become lord chamberlain.<br>
<br>It was long assumed that Warwick always intended to dispose of the religious conservatives who had helped him against Somerset, but one account suggests that Southampton precipitated the breach by confiding to Arundel and William Paulet, Baron St John, with whom he had been sent to examine Somerset, a wish to dispose of Warwick, with which Arundel apparently concurred. He may have considered St John a conservative too, but he told Warwick, who moved against Southampton and Arundel in mid-December.<br>
<br>Arundel lost his chamberlainship and membership of the privy council, as well as undergoing brief house arrest on 14 January 1550 on the basis of charges recorded by the young king as &#145;plucking down of bolts and locks at Westminster, giving of my stuff away, etc.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, ed. Jordan, 19). The fine of &pound;12,000 was heavy, and another account suggested the possibility of a more sinister element in the charges, mentioning with the vulnerability of the &#145;doores of the kynges hyghnes pryvy chamber&#146; &#145;the subvercyon of relygyon&#146;  (&#145;Letters of Richard Scudamore&#146;, 107&#150;8). Whether or not he had paid &pound;3200 Arundel gave recognizances for &pound;8800 which were cancelled a year later. His pardon depended on retirement to Sussex, supposedly to check new disorders.<br>
<br>After reported plots in 1550 and 1551 by Somerset to recover power, Warwick, newly created duke of Northumberland, finally arrested him on 16 October 1551 on a charge of treason. Arundel, having been summoned back to the privy council in August 1551 only to concur in an ultimatum to Mary that she practise protestantism, was belatedly added to the official version of Somerset's planned revenge and sent to the Tower of London on 8 November. The imperial ambassador, Fran&ccedil;ois van der Delft, reported that Arundel's arrest caused &#145;discontent &hellip; for the earl is very popular with all men and has the reputation of such integrity as would prevent him from taking part in any plot or treason&#146; and ascribed it to the earl's alleged retort that Dudleys had been more often traitors than Fitzalans  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1550&#150;52</i>, 392). Arundel admitted &#145;talk and communication&#146; with Somerset about arresting Warwick; they had &#145;agreed that religion should stand as it now doth&#146;  (Tytler, 2.43, 39). He was fortunate to escape with a year in the Tower and another fine: &pound;4000 in December 1552, payable in annual instalments of &pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., reduced in May 1553 to &pound;455 per annum and remitted in early July.<br>
<br>Northumberland was trying to buy support before Edward died but had left it much too late. Arundel reluctantly witnessed the letters patent naming Lady Jane Grey as heir on 21 June. He actually did homage to Jane on 9 July. When Northumberland set out to bring Mary to heel Arundel, unlike the London populace, allegedly wished him God speed and expressed hypocritical readiness &#145;to spende his bloode, even at his foote&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, 7). However, he hinted to his fellow privy councillors the undesirability of their location among Northumberland's henchmen in the Tower. Finally, on 19 July they signed an exhortation of loyalty to Jane, then left the Tower supposedly to meet ambassadors and proclaimed Mary instead. Arundel was willing to take the lead with William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke. His supposed speech (no doubt elaborated) to his fellows extolled legitimacy and accused Northumberland of &#145;practisinge my death by many wicked devises&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 119).<br>
<br>Arundel and Paget were chosen to ride to Mary and make the privy council's peace. With another defector, William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, and Mary's trusted friend Henry Jerningham, Arundel went to take custody of Northumberland at Cambridge. According to Robert Wingfield:<blockquote>At the sight of that Hooved Horse [Arundel], whom he had left in strict custody when he left London, the Bear [Northumberland] was afraid (as the result of a certain prophecy) that he would receive no light kick from his hoof, and his spirit was entirely broken. (MacCulloch, 267)</blockquote>The heraldic reference inverts a story whereby Northumberland sneered at Arundel's white horse blazon. It was recycled in <span class="italic">Leicester's Commonwealth</span> (1584) as spoken by the duke's son, Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. However, it seems more relevant to Northumberland's liking for fining Arundel:<blockquote>The white palfrey when he standeth in the stable and is well provendered is proud and fierce &hellip; but when he is once out of his hot stable and deprived a little of his ease and fat feed every boy may ride and master him at his pleasure, so is it (quoth he) with my lord of Arundel. (D. C. Peck, ed., <span class="italic">Leicester's Commonwealth: the Copy of a Letter Written by a Master of Art of Cambridge (1584) and Related Documents</span>, Athens, Ohio, 1985, 174&#150;5)</blockquote>Northumberland's error was fatal, and his suggestions the night before his execution on 22 August that Arundel intercede for his life were in vain. Arundel even assisted Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, in Northumberland's trial on 18 August and was later lord steward for that of Suffolk, his sister's errant fianc&eacute; on 17 February 1554.<h2>
<a name="MaryandPhilip15531558"></a>Mary and Philip, 1553&#150;1558</h2>The exchange of Queen Mary for Queen Jane brought Arundel nearer the centre of power. The post of lord great master of the household&#151;part of Northumberland's empire&#151;was abolished and Arundel became lord steward and titular president of the council in September 1553; the reversion supposedly arose from his own conservatism, &#145;this other name being brought in of late tyme, and taken out of France&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 121). He dubbed knights on Mary's behalf at her coronation on 1 October, where his son (one of those knighted) served as butler while he was high constable. Arundel received a licence, like Gardiner, for two hundred retainers (Paget and the other earls, only for one hundred).<br>
<br>Because Arundel was favoured by Mary peers used him as their proxy in the House of Lords more than anybody else: for example in 1554 he was proxy six times. He served on key committees for (abortive) treason legislation and for the repeal of Reformation statutes. He was commissioned to restore Cuthbert Tunstall and Edmund Bonner to the bishoprics of Durham and London and was appointed to the Lords committee of 1554 to examine the ramifications of reversing the Norfolk attainder: a convenient appointment considering the engagement of his daughter Mary Fitzalan to the heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13941/', "Thomas Howard, later fourth duke of Norfolk (1538&#150;1572)")</script>. An act of 1555 made Gardiner, Arundel, and Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Ely, Norfolk's trustees. By 1552 Arundel's other daughter, Jane Fitzalan, had married the Catholic peer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17179/', "John Lumley, Baron Lumley (c.1533&#150;1609)")</script>.<br>
<br>Like Paget, Arundel was sceptical of Gardiner's proposals to reverse the Reformation quickly. By May 1554 Paget, Arundel, and Pembroke, according to Charles V's ambassador, Simon Renard, were &#145;heretic peers&#146; whom Gardiner wanted arrested  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554</i>, 251). When Arundel complained loudly of Sussex grants to Sir John Gage, &#145;though he had obtained the queen's leave, several posts were sent after him to see what he was up to in London&#146;  (ibid., 290). Also, when Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger rebelled, Arundel, according to Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador, &#145;faict encor le malade&#146;  (Bernard, 80). The imputation of malingering is doubtful, and Arundel's biographer claimed that he raised sixty horse and 800 foot at his own expense. He had tied his fortune to Mary's Spanish marriage project, and allegedly he even hoped to be made lord treasurer. Arundel opposed Gardiner's wish to charge Elizabeth over the rising. Sent to interrogate her he ultimately apologized for troubling her. Renard feared Arundel's aspirations to marry his son to Elizabeth, but Maltravers was soon bestowed elsewhere, marrying Ann (<i>d</i>. 1581), third daughter and coheir of Sir John Wentworth of Gosfield in Essex, and widow of Sir Hugh Rich, son of Richard, first Baron Rich (licence obtained on 12 April 1555).<br>
<br>Arundel was one of the six privy councillors to whom Mary first announced the Spanish marriage; he was one of the commissioners for the marriage contract and later gave away the bride, and he was one of the eight suggested by Philip of Spain to constitute a more efficient inner council. Arundel invested Philip with the Garter upon his arrival in July 1554 and organized his English household, of which he was also steward and to which his heir, Maltravers, was appointed. Mary's consort made an especial effort at intimacy with the Fitzalans. His list of jewels at the queen's death included a necklace given to him by the countess &#145;as a valentine&#146; and a &#145;book of the Garter&#146; translated into Latin by Maltravers  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, 441&#150;2). Philip was notably attentive when in April 1555 Maltravers married. <span class="italic">The copye of a letter sent by John Bradforth to the right honorable lordes the erles of Arundel, Darbie, Shrewsbury, and Penbroke</span> (1556) named four earls thought to favour crowning Philip; they were also the four with &pound;500 Spanish pensions, rather than &pound;250.<br>
<br>Arundel's attendance at sessions of the 1555 parliament slumped below 50 per cent and he received only one proxy. Though he was part of the general absenteeism leading to the loss of Mary's cherished bill assuring Philip the regency, it is uncertain whether this was deliberate. His patronage in the House of Commons&#151;primarily Arundel, Chichester, and East Grinstead (later Guildford)&#151;diminished. That summer he joined Gardiner and Paget in the abortive Marcq peace conference. Subsequently Arundel and Pembroke were widely reported to have promised Philip to make England declare war on France. However, neither intimacy with Philip nor the two earls' role in foiling Northumberland could countervail Gardiner's influence with Mary. Arundel's biographer made the unconfirmed claim that his disgruntlement went so far that he resigned as lord steward before Mary's death because of the &#145;sinister workinge of some meane persons of her counsaile&#146;&#151;perhaps Gage again, lord chamberlain as well as a local rival in Sussex  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 123). He opposed censure of Thomas Wentworth, second Baron Wentworth, deputy of Calais, for alleged protection of heretics.<br>
<br>Arundel was not a favoured recipient of royal grants under Mary, with the equivocal exception of Nonsuch Palace, Surrey, given in 1556, supposedly at his own request to save it from demolition, by exchange for peripheral Fitzalan lands in Norfolk and &pound;486. Having constituted a drain on Henry VIII's purse and still unfinished, it now drained Arundel's own finances to complete it &#145;in as ample and perfit sorte as by the first intente and meaninge of the said kinge his olde maister the same should have beene performed&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 122&#150;3).<br>
<br>Once war with France broke out Mary appointed Arundel lieutenant-general for the defence of England (26 July 1557). His effectiveness was reduced by family tragedies. Maltravers, his heir, had died at Brussels on 30 June 1556 while taking a message for Philip to his cousin Maximilian. It was then reported of Arundel that &#145;although he is of vigorous age his wife nevertheless, being infirm, cannot give him hope of having other children&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1555&#150;6</i>, 559). His daughter, the duchess of Norfolk, died on 25 August 1557, two months after giving birth to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13929/', "Philip Howard, later thirteenth earl of Arundel (1557&#150;1595)")</script>. The countess of Arundel died on 20 or 21 October at Arundel House and was buried on 28 October at St Clement Danes but afterwards her body was removed to Arundel. The combined effect incapacitated Arundel: the Lumleys had to move into Nonsuch, where in fact they remained for the rest of his life, taking over increasing amounts of business.<br>
<br>Arundel was, despite lack of diplomatic success at Marcq, appointed by Mary as a commissioner for peace negotiations in October 1558, although Philip had suggested Paulet, now first marquess of Winchester, and Edward Fiennes de Clinton, ninth Baron Clinton. Arundel had limited capabilities for formal diplomatic negotiation, though he supposedly &#145;understood Latin better than he spoke it&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1553</i>, 327). He mainly served to confer with Philip, then to delay matters by immobilization with a &#145;rheum&#146; and his own departure to England upon Mary's death on 17 November. The task was unpromising at best. Both Arundel and Thirlby professed to fear the personal consequences of agreeing to surrender Calais. Face was saved in the final treaty by a French promise to return it in eight years (or at the Greek calends).<h2>
<a name="Elizabethmarriageandsuccessionprojects15581568"></a>Elizabeth: marriage and succession projects, 1558&#150;1568</h2>Upon Elizabeth's accession Gomez Suarez de Figueroa, fifth count of Feria, reported that the queen &#145;joked with me about what had been said of her marriage to the earl of Arundel. She does not get on with him&#146;  (Rodr&iacute;guez-Salgado and Adams, 331); he later added that the earl was &#145;a flighty man of small ability&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 19). The rumour that Elizabeth and Robert Dudley were to be poisoned at a banquet given by Arundel was a further joke on the part of Dudley and the queen  (ibid., 95&#150;6). The Austrians also dismissed him as a contender: according to Baron Breuner, &#145;he and he alone entertains this hope, for he is somewhat advanced in years and also rather silly and loutish, is not well-favoured, nor has a handsome figure&#146;  (von Klarwill, 113). He was said to have spent &pound;600 on jewels to influence Elizabeth's female attendants. His extravagance at her visit to Nonsuch in August 1559 was also noted, though he later pragmatically charged much of it to the steward's department.<br>
<br>There was consensus on Arundel's resentment at the effective order of precedence at Elizabeth's court, especially that of Dudley. One outlet was taking an interest in the investigation of the death of Dudley's wife, Amy Dudley <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robsart, in autumn 1560. At the Garter meetings of 1561 and 1562 Arundel staunchly opposed proposals to recommend the queen to marry Dudley. Finally, in November 1564, &#145;being miscontented with sondry thynges, as he sayd, of interruptions in his office, he surrendered his [steward's] staff, with sundry speeches of offence, to the queen's majesty&#146;&#151;speeches offensive enough to bring on a month's house arrest  (Wright, 1.180). Perhaps among the interruptions was being called &#145;an impudent, discourteous knave&#146; in 1559 by Sir William Pickering, a supposed rival for Elizabeth, when he claimed Pickering lacked the rank to enter the queen's private apartments: &#145;Pickering tells it in public and refrains from challenging him as he holds him of small account, but it is only right that he should refrain as the other is very weak&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 109). Later it was reported that Arundel, if Pickering became consort, planned to sell his land and go abroad.<br>
<br>Catholics suggested that Arundel's vain hope of marriage to Elizabeth lay behind his absence from the House of Lords in 1559, pleading illness, when he was first needed to vote against the <span class="roman">Supremacy Bill</span> on 18 March, thus also squandering the proxy of Thomas Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland. On 8 March Arundel had given his proxy to Lumley: it was the latter who assented initially to the supremacy. Arundel, however, returned on 17 April, being added to the remodelled committee for the revised bill, to which he assented&#151;nor did he record dissent to the <span class="roman">Uniformity Bill</span>. He was one of the six privy councillors in 1562 agreeing that England should not participate in the Council of Trent.<br>
<br>Increasing detachment from the court encouraged thought about the succession. Arundel allegedly was interested in conveying Katherine Grey, second daughter of Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk, into Spanish hands, and then, in the unexpected company of Sir William Cecil, conspired to marry her to Edward Seymour, first earl of Hertford. He himself was said to want to marry Hertford's sister, Jane Seymour. For half a decade Arundel, like Norfolk, was agreed to prefer a protestant Grey to a Catholic Mary, queen of Scots. When Elizabeth fell ill with smallpox in 1563 the Howard family were reported to be discussing at Arundel House their preference for the Grey claim over that of Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon. The queen wanted Dudley appointed regent. The Spanish ambassador, Alvaro de la Quadra, bishop of Aquila, casting Arundel rather than Norfolk as the faction leader, heard that he later reacted to Elizabeth's fury by saying &#145;that if she wanted to govern the country by passion &hellip; the nobles would not allow her to do so&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 273).<br>
<br>There were few signs left of the militant Arundel of Henry's reign. He consistently opposed Elizabethan military adventures, those directed against France as well as those against Spain, to which he was supposed to be more sympathetic. He was the only privy councillor on Christmas eve 1559, of six initial doubters, to hold out against intervention in Scotland. When a crackdown on Catholics was proposed he and Clinton &#145;not only came to rough words, but fell to fisticuffs and grabbing each other's beards&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 126).<br>
<br>In May 1565 Arundel was absent from privy council meetings on how to dissuade Mary from marrying Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley; he and Robert Dudley, now earl of Leicester, were both mentioned as more palatable options during Sir Nicholas Throckmorton's embassy to the Scottish queen. Not now ambitious for a throne Arundel disliked aid to the subsequent Scottish rebellion known as the chaseabout raid. By 1566 Arundel had mellowed towards Leicester enough to attempt a degree of reconciliation between the latter and Norfolk.<br>
<br>Arundel was now uncomfortable enough in Elizabeth's England to withdraw abroad in 1566&#150;7, ostensibly to treat his gout in Padua but also passing through the Spanish Netherlands and the Rhineland, generating ill feeling as he went. He was &#145;not able to abide the smell of the ship that was made ready&#146; to take him down the Rhine  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 82). He annoyed William of Orange, &#145;though he could reasonably speake French&#146;, by keeping to English: &#145;I love to speake in that language in which I can best utter my mind and not mistake&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 492). One factor in the ignominious end of Dr John Man's embassy in Spain in 1568 was the ambassador's opposition to Feria's &#145;evill dealing with the earle of Arundell&#146;  (Wright, 1.248), though the earl despised Man's &#145;low position&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1558&#150;67</i>, 525). The quarrel involved Arundel allegedly slighting Feria's (English Catholic) brother-in-law and Feria &#145;maintaining&#146; against him one Burlace.<h2>
<a name="Conspiracy15681572"></a>Conspiracy, 1568&#150;1572</h2>After returning to England, Arundel received the sop of reappointment to the joint lord lieutenancy of Sussex and Surrey. Upon Mary's flight to England on 16 May 1568 he reminded Elizabeth that the Scottish queen's ejection by her subjects was &#145;a new doctrine &hellip; not good to be taught in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1563&#150;9</i>, 595). He sat on the privy council subcommittee considering the charges against Mary and then with Norfolk on the inconclusive Westminster commission.<br>
<br>In the diplomatic crisis with Spain in 1569 started by seizure of the treasure ships destined for Fernando Alv&aacute;rez de Toledo, duke of Alba, &#145;certain principal councillors&#146; immediately met at Nonsuch and condemned Cecil for adventurism  (Teulet, 1.115). Arundel with his two sons-in-law, Norfolk and Lumley, conveyed an offer via Roberto di Ridolfi, one of their moneylenders who also fancied himself as a grand political intriguer, to overthrow Cecil as a means towards better relations. The Spanish ambassador, Guerau de Spes, remarked of Norfolk and Arundel equally, &#145;the fact that they are Englishmen, and not entirely Catholic, makes one always suspicious of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1568&#150;79</i>, 164).<br>
<br>In September, when Elizabeth rejected Norfolk's plan to marry Mary, Arundel sent Hugh Owen with a message suggesting seizure of the Tower. Instead Norfolk retreated indecisively to Kenninghall, leaving Northumberland and Charles Neville, sixth earl of Westmorland, to rebel on their own in November. The rebel leaders claimed that they had Norfolk's and Arundel's concurrence. Arundel was removed from office as lord lieutenant and confined at Eton College, then at Nonsuch. John Leslie, bishop of Ross, later claimed that Norfolk said &#145;he would depart into his cuntrey, and so he had resolved be th'advyse of th'irles of Arundell and Pembroch, who would do the lyke&#146;  (Murdin, 44).<br>
<br>Arundel described himself as &#145;a trewe and syke prysoner&#146;  (Murdin, 569); &#145;For lacke of disgestion he grewe to his old diseases; and for lacke of opportunitie to his owne causes he grewe to greate hindrance&#146;, such as foreclosure on estates pledged for loans  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 212). However, he returned to the privy council in March 1570 as an advocate of reconciliation with Mary, of whose proposed marriage to Norfolk he denied being &#145;the author&#146;  (Teulet, 3.104). Leicester came to his support. Arundel accepted sponsorship from Leicester who also, being now chancellor of Oxford, probably got from Merton College a long lease for him of Chessington Park, Surrey, adjoining Nonsuch.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Leslie optimistically asserted the readiness of Arundel and others to oppose anti-Catholic bills in the Lords, while Ridolfi still advertised around Europe the earl's alleged readiness to be part of a Catholic rising 15,000 strong in Sussex, Surrey, and Hampshire, and Owen offered Arundel Castle to prospective rescuers of Mary as a safe route on their escape to France (a suggestion originally made in 1569). Arundel was, however, little involved in the Ridolfi plot of 1571, in which Lumley was more fully engaged. Mary, probably with reason, doubted his commitment to the escape route via Sussex: &#145;if the Ld. Arundell or Penbroke wold appoynt a knight to convey her she wold adventure; otherwise she durst nott&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 290, fol. 36<i>v</i>). Although Arundel was again placed under house arrest after 26 September 1571 as a result of the plot, his limited involvement (as well as age and ill health) kept him out of the Tower and led to his release at the end of 1572.<h2>
<a name="LastoftheFitzalans15731580"></a>Last of the Fitzalans, 1573&#150;1580</h2>In 1573 Arundel returned to the privy council. In 1574 the privy council bolstered his decayed local standing by forcing Sir Thomas Palmer of Angmering, recently sheriff of Sussex, who had slandered Arundel after quarrelling with his servant Thomas Stoughton, to apologize after putting him in prison for a brief spell. Generally the combination of age, political disgrace, and financial embarrassment reduced Arundel to a cipher. The parliamentary patronage of Guildford, for example, had now irrevocably passed to Stoughton, who acted independently, and the Mores of Loseley. However, Arundel did strike a blow for local Catholicism. After a petition from Sir Thomas Palmer of Parham (a frequent MP in Arundel's seats) and other gentlemen in 1577 against episcopal harassment he informed the privy council of Richard Curtis, bishop of Chichester's aggressive advancement of protestantism in his diocese. The bishop was severely admonished for his overzealous approach.<br>
<br>Arundel's attendance of the privy council finally dropped to a mere two occasions in 1579, he being &#145;sore troubled with the goute&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 214). If, as the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, claimed, the privy council sent him and the lord chancellor, Sir Thomas Bromley, to Elizabeth that October to advise against the Anjou match, he had not been active in preliminary discussions. He made his will on 30 December 1579, died at Arundel House on 24 February 1580, and was buried in the collegiate chapel at Arundel on 22 March. Allegedly he was &#145;reconciled some time before his death to the Catholicke Church &hellip; by the persuasion and procurement of the Lord Lumley, his son-in-law&#146;  (Duke of Norfolk, 180).<br>
<br>There is a discontinuity between the &#145;cunning&#146; deputy of Calais, the decisive political player in Mary's accession, and the much mocked suitor of Elizabeth. Numerous biographies of Elizabeth rely on abstracting Breuner's &#145;lout&#146; remark to describe Arundel: as his travels hinted, he rarely got on with foreigners. The idea that he was potentially significant, if isolated, in 1559 has been lost since J. A. Froude's overblown rhetoric: &#145;he moved in a cloud, suspected of aims which he would not avow, without a conviction, without a purpose, feared by all men and trusted by none&#146;  (J. A. Froude, <span class="italic">Reign of Elizabeth</span>, 1911, 1.31).<br>
<br>Arundel supposedly compromised one of the great English aristocratic fortunes through &#145;sheer improvidence&#146;, but his debts were hardly on the scale of the earls of Leicester, Essex, Huntingdon, or Oxford  (Stone, <span class="italic">Crisis</span>, 542). After his son's death in 1556 he lost interest in his affairs and apparently did not like his grandson sufficiently to take trouble over his inheritance. Even Philip Howard's hagiography emphasizes that evil influences at court made him &#145;neglect his duty in a maner wholy to the earl his grandfather&#146;, especially in his attitude to his aunt Jane Lumley and to his own wife  (Duke of Norfolk, 15). Arundel's will was proved on 27 February 1580 and stressed Lumley's &#145;great traveile and paines taken for me and aboute my busines and affaires&#146;. His old client Bromley was to be invoked in case of &#145;variance&#146; between heir and executor  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/62, sig. 1).<br>
<br>Arundel willed Lumley Nonsuch's lavish contents. He also made a succession of alienations of land during Elizabeth's reign. The most dramatic measure was the assumption in 1564 of liability for &pound;12,350 owed by the state of Florence to the English crown, to guarantee which Arundel pledged &pound;800 worth of lands (&pound;620 would have been more usual) to several privy councillors to hold for Lumley's use. Both Arundel and Lumley had also provided bonds for Norfolk's borrowing, notably for the acquisition of the wardship of George Dacre, fifth Baron Dacre of Gilsland, in 1567 (after whose death two years later Arundel conveniently sat on the commission which decided the inheritance case in Norfolk's favour), transactions that had provided a fatal introduction to Ridolfi. Arundel did get &pound;8900 from Norfolk in return for conveying lands to Philip Howard during his lifetime.<br>
<br>In 1570 Lumley received a life interest in the whole honour of Arundel, which he conveyed to the earl's heir, Philip Howard, upon his death. There had been permanent alienations, especially in the west away from the main lands. Lumley stated that on Arundel's death the earl had lands worth &pound;1900 per annum (about half his inheritance), of which only &pound;400 per annum came to him rather than to mortgage holders, and owed &pound;24,000 (&pound;13,000 to the crown). In 1585 Lumley still owed &pound;11,400 to the crown, but by advancing cash to Huntingdon he got the latter to assume the liability.<br>
<br>It cannot be said, however, that Arundel was economical, even as peers went. He added a renaissance collecting mania to old-fashioned conspicuous consumption. It was symptomatic that when most great peers, even Norfolk, gave Elizabeth a new year gift of &pound;20, Arundel had to give &pound;30. His household was probably at least as large as those of the wealthiest of his peers, if he had 106 servants able to serve in the army of 1544. The myths that Arundel introduced to England in 1566 the coach and silk stockings testify at least to reputed susceptibility to foreign extravagances.<br>
<br>The importance of Arundel's intellectual interests have been generally minimized. However, they were liberal enough for his daughters to acquire notable learning. Supposedly, &#145;he was not unlearned; he was quicke and redy in conceivinge, and so much naturally given unto breefenes in utteringe of his mynde, that perhaps to the unskilful he mighte seame somewhat harde&#146;  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 212). He collected over a third of Lumley's eventual 3000-volume library, and possibly a similar proportion of his 230 pictures. He also employed at Nonsuch 127 musicians, besides a choir, and was a significant patron of Thomas Tallis. Gregory Martin dedicated to Arundel a manuscript on Greek before withdrawing, via Norfolk's household, to Douai. Humphrey Llwyd advised him on his library and was seated in parliament by him for East Grinstead in 1559. There were more than reasons of rank for the University of Oxford to make him its high steward in 1555 and then chancellor on 6 February 1559, presumably in a late gesture of conservatism; he resigned on 12 June.<br>
<br>Arundel's biographer cast him as a fiscal conservative&#151;&#145;he could never incline to inriche himselfe by the crowne, nor by extraordinarie fetches and compasses to the hindrance of fre trades&#146;&#151;ignoring his minting profits after Somerset's fall and his small chance of an Elizabethan monopoly grant  (Nichols, &#145;Life&#146;, 213). He was adventurous enough to be a founder member of the Muscovy Company.<br>
<br>The decay of Arundel's political fortunes under Elizabeth owed much to valetudinarianism but more to his Howard marriage alliance. An inextricable tie with a losing faction, however ostensibly distinguished, brought to an end the more acrobatic, and more successful, part of his political career, which had little to do with the illusion of a decidedly Catholic stance created in 1569&#150;71. No such tendency appeared even in the succession discussions of 1563, let alone in Edward's reign. The arrogance and extravagance imputed to him may be convincing, but the stupidity so often added is probably overstated. To call him &#145;a shrewd man of the world with a keen eye for the main chance&#146;  (Gooch, 11) might understate his luck; but some degree of skill was probably also required to survive repeated imprisonments and to avoid execution, which many of his associates failed to manage.<br>
