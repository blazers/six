<span class="headword">Wallace,  Robert</span>  (1791&#150;1850), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and biographer</span>, second son and child (of six) born to Robert Wallace (1749/50&#150;1830) and his wife, Phoebe (1756/7&#150;1837), was born at Dudley, Worcestershire, on 26 February 1791. He was baptized on 19 March by the name of Robert, to which in early life he sometimes added William. His father was a pawnbroker, his grandfather a Dumfriesshire farmer. Two younger brothers also became Unitarian ministers: James Cowdan Wallace (1793?&#150;1841), a prolific writer of hymns, served at Totnes (1824&#150;6), York Street, London (1827&#150;8), Brighton (1828&#150;9), and Wareham (1831&#150;41); and Charles Wallace (1796&#150;1859), who studied at the University of Glasgow (MA, 1817) and Manchester College, York (1817&#150;19), and was minister at Altrincham and Hale, Cheshire, in 1829&#150;56.<br>
<br>Wallace's father had been raised in the Church of Scotland but in Dudley attended the Presbyterian chapel in Wolverhampton Street. Until 1807 the younger Wallace was educated by John Todd (1775?&#150;1838), curate of Frankley and St Kenelm, Worcestershire. In 1808 he came under the influence of James Hews Bransby, who had come to Wolverhampton Street in 1805. Bransby made Wallace a Unitarian and prepared him to enter Manchester College, York, in September 1810. He left York in 1815 and became in September minister at Elder Yard, Chesterfield, where he also conducted a school for sixteen years. In 1825 he married Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of Michael Lakin of Birmingham; they had a daughter, who survived her father.<br>
<br>Wallace distinguished himself as a theological writer and was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> and the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> on biblical and patristic topics. In 1834, in the latter journal, he reviewed J. H. Newman's <span class="italic">Arians of the Fourth Century</span>, a work, Robert Aspland said in commissioning the review, that contained &#145;some ingenuity and some learning, but quite enough paradox and high-church presumption, and even <i>papism</i>, to keep a reviewer alive&#146;  (Aspland to Wallace, 24 Jan 1834). His essay of 1835, again in the <span class="italic">Reformer</span>, &#145;On the parenthetical and digressive style of John's gospel&#146;, is a very able piece of criticism.<br>
<br>In 1840 Manchester College returned to Manchester from York, and Wallace was appointed to succeed Charles Wellbeloved as professor of critical and exegetical theology; in 1842 he was made principal of the theological department. His theological position was conservative, but he was the first in his own denomination to bring to his classroom the processes and results of German critical research. He was held in great respect and affection by his students.<br>
<br>The change to Manchester did not suit Wallace's health; after six years he resigned and in June 1846 became minister of Trim Street Chapel, Bath. He was made visitor of his college, became a fellow of the Geological Society, and worked hard at the completion of his <span class="italic">Antitrinitarian Biography</span>, which was published in March 1850. He preached for the last time on 10 March and died at 20 Camden Place, Walcot, Bath, on 13 May 1850. He was buried in the Trim Street Chapel graveyard at Lyncombe, near Bath.<br>
<br>His three-volume <span class="italic">Antitrinitarian Biography</span> was the result of nearly twenty-four years of labour. A few of the earlier biographies were published anonymously in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> in 1831 and part of the introduction in the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> in 1845&#150;6. In breadth of treatment and in depth of original research Wallace's work is inferior to that of Thomas Rees (1777&#150;1864), but he covers more ground than any previous writer, dealing with continental and English figures from the Reformation to the opening of the eighteenth century. His introduction deals mainly with the development of opinion in England during that period. His careful array of authorities is especially useful. An extended list of his separate and periodical publications appears at the conclusion of the obituary by his brother Charles in the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> in 1850.<br>
