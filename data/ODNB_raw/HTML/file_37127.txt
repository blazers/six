<span class="headword">Arnulf</span>  (1105<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1184), <span class="occ">bishop of Lisieux</span>, was born near S&eacute;es in Normandy, the second son of Hardouin de Neuville and an unnamed mother; a younger brother and at least one sister completed the family. Following the example of their maternal grandfather, Norman, dean of the chapter at S&eacute;es, and their maternal uncle, Jean, bishop of Lisieux, both Arnulf and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95164/', "John (d. 1142)")</script>, who became bishop of S&eacute;es in 1124 [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95163/', "John (d. 1137)")</script>], were trained for careers in the church. Arnulf began his formal education at the cathedral school of S&eacute;es and for a short time held the position of treasurer of Bayeux. After he was named an archdeacon of S&eacute;es, he became a pupil of Geoffroi, bishop of Chartres, and travelled to Bologna to study law.<br>
<br>Arnulf made his first public mark in 1133 with the dissemination of a particularly vitriolic pamphlet directed against the antipope Anacletus II. This <span class="italic">Invectiva in Girardum Engolismensem episcopum</span> has been excoriated by modern readers as calumnious and antisemitic, but at the time it was promulgated by such church dignitaries as Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Peter the Venerable, and Haimeric, papal chancellor under Honorius II. Arnulf completed his education in 1136 and travelled to England to serve the court of King Stephen. His most important assignment during that period was an appearance at the Lateran Council of 1139, where he defended Stephen's claim to the throne of England by attacking Matilda's legitimacy. His arguments were fallacious, and in any case Pope Innocent II declined to give a definitive judgement.<br>
<br>Arnulf was elected bishop of Lisieux in 1141. He brought to his office a conviction that a bishop had a dual responsibility to serve both church and monarchy. During the 1140s he wavered in his political allegiance, hoping to find a king who was both worthy of his support and in need of episcopal guidance. For a time he offered his services to Louis VII of France, and accompanied him on the second crusade as papal legate in charge of the Anglo-Norman contingent. Upon his return Abbot Suger of St Denis employed him as an ambassador to the court of Matilda and her son, Henry.<br>
<br>In Henry, Arnulf finally found the potential monarch for whom he had been searching. From 1150 to 1154 Arnulf was an active member of the entourage of the young duke of Normandy, travelling with him as he consolidated his hold over Normandy and pressed his claim to the English throne. In 1154 he accompanied Henry to England for his coronation, after which he was rewarded by the gift of the valuable chapelry of Bosham in Sussex and the title of chief justiciar for Normandy. Extant charters show that Arnulf served as a testator to Henry's acts at least 121 times between 1154 and 1179. He always considered himself a member of the court, although his services were somewhat sporadic and sometimes unappreciated by the king and his other advisers. In 1156 he persuaded Henry to delay indefinitely his plans to invade Ireland by pointing out to him, quite correctly, that the papal permission obtained by John of Salisbury acknowledged the pope's overlordship of all islands&#151;a matter of no small consequence to the ruler of an island kingdom. Henry reluctantly agreed not to act on the papal permission, but John of Salisbury never forgave Arnulf for placing royal interest ahead of papal prerogatives.<br>
<br>During the papal schism of 1159 Arnulf was charged with the task of keeping Henry loyal to Alexander III. Henry, however, refused to commit himself, leaving the decision to his assembled bishops. Arnulf wrote a letter to the English bishops shortly before their meeting, telling them that the French king, the French bishops, and Henry himself were all agreed to support Alexander, and that they were only postponing their announcement until the English bishops could vote to join them. The facts were quite different; Henry and Louis had discussed the problem but had reached no settlement. The archbishop of Canterbury was convinced, however, and the English bishops acquiesced, leaving Henry no choice but to support them as he had promised. Arnulf achieved his goal, thereby opening himself to charges of duplicity.<br>
<br>The controversy over Thomas Becket once again involved Arnulf in a test of the feasibility of a bishop serving both his church and his king. At the beginning of the crisis, in 1163&#150;4, Arnulf seemed to support the king. It was he who advised Henry to try to break the unanimity of the English bishops; he also made six trips to the papal court at Sens to persuade Alexander to confirm the constitutions of Clarendon. When those efforts failed, Arnulf turned to Becket, trying to persuade him to moderate his views for the sake of ecclesiastical unity. Throughout the negotiations Arnulf was on hand, advising all sides of possible compromises, sometimes deploring Henry's intransigence and sometimes losing patience with the obdurate Becket. He was with Henry when the news of Becket's death arrived, and wrote a sycophantic letter to the pope in Henry's defence. And at Avranches, in May 1172, it was Arnulf who persuaded Henry to accept the final settlement. Throughout the crisis, no one was quite sure which cause Arnulf espoused; no one trusted him completely.<br>
<br>Arnulf's last years displayed a steady decline of influence. He alienated the king one last time by seeming to offer support to Henry, the Young King, during the rebellion of 1173. The canons of his cathedral turned against him, and Henry began an organized campaign to drive the cantankerous old bishop from his office. In 1181 Arnulf formally resigned his bishopric and retired to the monastery of St Victor in Paris. He left behind him two monuments, one inscribed on parchment, the other carved in stone. The collection of his personal correspondence revealed much about the affairs of the twelfth century; the semi-Romanesque, semi-Gothic design of his new cathedral reflected his own dual goals. Although he had influenced popes and kings, he ended his life a disappointed man, mourning the passage of a simpler world in which a bishop could serve both church and monarchy. He died on 31 August 1184 at St Victor.<br>
