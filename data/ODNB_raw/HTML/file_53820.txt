<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stern family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1830&#150;1964), <span class="occ">merchant bankers</span>, came to prominence in Britain with <a name="cosubject_59431"></a><span class="headword">David Stern</span>, Viscount de Stern in the Portuguese nobility  (1807&#150;1877)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_60126"></a><span class="headword">Herman Stern</span>, Baron de Stern in the Portuguese nobility  (1815&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span>. They were born at Frankfurt, two of the twelve children of Jacob Samuel H. Stern (1780&#150;1833), an eminent Frankfurt wine merchant, and his wife, Theresia (<i>d</i>. 1850). Jacob's sister, Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1782), had married Baron Salomon de Rothschild (1774&#150;1855) of Vienna in 1800, a brother of Nathan Meyer Rothschild, founder of the eponymous London merchant bank.<br>
<br>Jacob Stern, who established his merchanting business in 1807, emulated the Rothschild family's successful formula by dispersing his sons to European banking centres, thereby forming a network of family houses centred on Frankfurt and working together for a common good. Two of his sons, Abraham and Leopold, settled in Paris, and a third in Berlin, while David moved to London about 1833 and seems to have been joined by Herman in the 1840s. The Sterns' Frankfurt business was of major importance, and was later closely allied with Deutsche Bank and favoured by Bismarck.<br>
<br>In London, David and Herman Stern swiftly emerged as successful merchant bankers, specializing in the provision of long-term finance in the form of bond issues and company promotions. At an early date their position was consolidated through marriage to the daughters and heirs of Aaron Asher Goldsmid (1835&#150;1861), a senior partner in the wealthy bullion brokers Mocatta and Goldsmid. David married Sophia Goldsmid (<i>d</i>. 1900) in London in 1841 and Herman married her sister Julia (<i>d</i>. 1899) in 1845. Each marriage produced two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The firm of Stern Brothers undertook its first public bond issue in 1863, when &pound;2.5 million worth of bonds were marketed for the kingdom of Portugal. The Sterns went on to make their name in Portuguese finance, but their clients also included the kingdoms of Italy and Spain, the Argentine and Peruvian republics, and the Danubian principalities. Few of these borrowers enjoyed the highest standing in the bond markets. <span class="italic">The Economist</span> labelled the Peruvian transaction &#145;very doubtful&#146;  (23 March 1872), while many issues were made at ruinously low prices for the issuers. Essential to the Sterns' success was their ability to distribute bonds in continental markets; of the &pound;2.5 million issued for Portugal in 1863, for example, only half was sold in London.<br>
<br>In Europe the Sterns' other interests included &#145;a number of mortgage companies which were reaping the first fruits of city development&#146;  (Jenks, 270), while money was also made from &#145;the company mania which culminated in the failure of Overend &amp; Gurney&#146; in 1866  (<span class="italic">Bankers' Magazine</span>, 1047). With a handful of similar houses, Sterns formed the International Financial Society in 1863 so as to be in a stronger position to win financial business in Europe.<br>
<br>Profit and prestige accumulated: a grateful king of Portugal created Herman a baron in 1864 and David a viscount five years later, when they introduced the prefix de to their surname. The financial strength of the house was evident after their deaths in the firm's &pound;250,000 contribution to the fund which guaranteed a Bank of England loan to Barings at the time of the Baring crisis. This far exceeded the sums offered by such leading houses as Hambros, Brown Shipley, Huths, and Schroders. David de Stern died on 19 January 1877 at 22 Queen's Gate, Hyde Park, London. His brother Herman survived for another decade, dying on 20 October 1887 at 4 Hyde Park Gate, London. He was buried at Kingsbury Road Jewish cemetery, Dalston. David's estate was assessed for probate at under &pound;1 million, while Herman left &pound;3.5 million&#151;one of the wealthiest estates of Victorian Britain. It included Horace Walpole's Gothic mansion at Strawberry Hill, which Herman had acquired in 1883. Yet the Stern brothers never won acceptance by the City's &eacute;lite. &#145;He was a prominent, but hardly an eminent, financier&#146;, was the <span class="italic">Bankers' Magazine</span>'s lofty judgement on Herman  (p. 1047).<br>
<br>David and Herman were directors of the Imperial Bank Ltd, a London joint-stock bank established in 1862; while Herman also held directorships in the Bank of Rumania, the London Financial Society, the London and San Francisco Bank, and the East London Waterworks. In the main they both steered well clear of British political life and neither contributed to major City institutions; but close identification with their Jewish roots resulted in generous support of the Jewish community. In particular, Herman participated in the direction of the Anglo-Jewish Association and also the Jews' Free School in London's Spitalfields.<br>
<br>The founders of the firm were succeeded at Stern Brothers by three of their sons and a nephew. <a name="cosubject_60127"></a><span class="headword">Sydney James Stern</span>, Baron Wandsworth  (1844&#150;1912)<span class="occ"></span>, was the elder son of David Stern, but &#145;soon retired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 16 Feb 1912, 10). He did not marry. Notwithstanding his &#145;retiring and reticent disposition&#146;  (ibid.) he sat in the Commons as a Liberal from 1891 until he was created Baron Wandsworth in 1895, having generously subscribed to party funds. He died on 10 February 1912 at 10 Great Stanhope Street, London. His estate was valued for probate at over &pound;1.5 million. He was buried at Kingsbury Road Jewish cemetery, Dalston.<br>
<br>The career of Herman's son <a name="cosubject_60128"></a><span class="headword">Herbert Stern</span>, first Baron Michelham  (1851&#150;1919)<span class="occ"></span>, runs in parallel. Born on 28 September 1851, he married Aim&eacute;e Geraldine Bradshaw (<i>d</i>. 1927) in 1899. He was admitted to Stern Brothers' partnership when young but withdrew about 1910, apparently on account of a rift with his juniors. He then established Herbert Stern &amp; Co., merchant bankers of London and Paris, but &#145;this was concerned rather with his own operations than with any general business&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Jan 1919, 9c). His elevation to a barony in 1905 was greeted with uproar. &#145;Money&#146;, said the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, &#145;was at the root of it&#146;  (Camplin, 125). He was created KCVO in 1912 and presented to the nation the quadriga which surmounts the arch on Constitution Hill. Herbert died at 26 Prince's Gate, London, on 7 January 1919, leaving an estate valued at &pound;2 million. Buried at Kingsbury Road Jewish cemetery, Dalston, he was succeeded as Lord Michelham by his only child, Herman Alfred (1900&#150;1984), on whose death the barony became extinct.<br>
<br>The other important partner in these years, who succeeded Herman as senior until 1901, is more obscure. He was <a name="cosubject_60129"></a><span class="headword">James Julius Stern</span>  (1835&#150;1901)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 30 June 1835. He was the son of Julius Stern of Frankfurt and Berlin, nephew of David and Herman. He resided in London from about 1860, and married in 1871 Lucy Leah Biedermann of Vienna, whose sister was married to Henry Bischoffsheim of the London merchant bankers Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt. They had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96802/', "Sir Frederick Claude Stern")</script>, horticulturist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36283/', "Sir Albert Gerald Stern")</script>, banker and pioneer of tank construction, and two daughters. He died at 25 Prince's Gate, London, on 5 January 1901, and was survived by his wife. James Julius also left over &pound;1 million. He was buried in the Hendon cemetery of the West London Synagogue.<br>
<br>On Herbert's withdrawal in 1910, it fell to <a name="cosubject_48322"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edward David Stern</span>, baronet  (1854&#150;1933)<span class="occ"></span>, who had become a partner probably in the 1870s, to lead the business as senior partner. The younger son of David Stern, Edward was born in Marylebone, London, on 18 July 1854, and was educated at King's College School, London (1866&#150;9), and later studied at King's College, London (1874&#150;5, 1878), graduating in general literature and science. In 1883 he married Constance (1858&#150;1918), daughter of Sir George Jessel, master of the rolls. Constance died in 1918, and Edward Stern subsequently married Sir Adolph Tuck's daughter, Sybil Grace (1887&#150;1979), in 1925. Neither marriage produced any children.<br>
<br>The merchant bank over which Edward presided maintained its alliance with the firms of Jacob S. H. Stern of Frankfurt and A. J. Stern &amp; Cie of Paris, although each was independent of the others. Its transactions in the bond market for sovereign clients continued, and included an 1889 conversion of Argentine bonds and an 1908 issue of Turkish government bonds. The house also cornered Bulgarian government finance in London, and other business included the London paying agency for German government bonds, shared with Deutsche Bank and Discontogessellschaft.<br>
<br>The First World War must have severely damaged the firm's foundations. Links with Frankfurt and Paris were left in disarray, and its European client network and security distribution channels destroyed. At the same time English-based members of the family publicly distanced themselves from their German cousins. During the First World War, Lord Michelham provided hospitals in Paris for British officers and offered ten prizes of &pound;1000 a piece for each Zeppelin shot down.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Stern Brothers was a shadow of its former self. Although the firm had led Bulgarian government bond issues on equal terms with Schroders and the Ottoman Bank in 1909, in 1926, when the syndicate reformed, Sterns was scarcely up to the task. &#145;It was the first issue &hellip; Stern Brothers had made for many years&#146;, commented Schroders, &#145;and they were full of their own importance and very touchy on questions of prestige&#146;  (Roberts, 200).<br>
<br>Outside Sterns, Edward's one prestigious appointment was, from 1901, a directorship of the London Joint Stock Bank Ltd, which later became the Midland Bank. He lived in splendour at 4 Carlton House Terrace, London, and at Fan Court, Chertsey, Surrey, where he gave generously to the local community. His particular interests were the Jews' Deaf and Dumb Home (he himself was deaf), the Jews' Orphan Asylum, and the Royal Albert Orphanage, of which he was treasurer. The West London Synagogue also benefited from his giving. Edward Stern was knighted in 1904 and made a baronet in 1922.<br>
<br>A quietly spoken and reserved man, Sir Edward showed modest ability as a banker, presiding over Stern Brothers' graceful decline and appearing in old age as an improbable character. He was &#145;the last prominent City man to go daily to the office in a horse drawn carriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 April 1933, 12c), while at home his progression on horseback from Fan Court to the nearby racecourse proved &#145;a triumphant progress. &hellip; People old and young stood at their gates waiting to see him pass. &hellip; Shouts of &#147;Good old Sir Edward&#148; testified to his popularity&#146;  (ibid., 20 April 1933, 15b). He died on 17 April 1933 at 4 Carlton House Terrace, London, leaving most of his estate to London University. His pictures and other collections went to the National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Sir Edward was buried at the Kingsbury Road Jewish cemetery, Dalston.<br>
<br>Sir Albert Gerald Stern, the second son of James Julius and Lucy Stern, succeeded Sir Edward as senior partner of the firm in 1933. Educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, he converted to Christianity at an early age and became a partner in Stern Brothers in 1903. Although he negotiated a large loan to the sultan of Morocco, Albert Stern had no real flair as a merchant banker. His most prominent contribution, and for which he was awarded a knighthood, was as a pioneer of tank warfare in the First World War. Stern continued as a partner in Stern Brothers until 1964 when, as a virtual shell, the firm discontinued business.<br>
<br>The original Stern brothers, David and Herman, achieved immense wealth and leadership within Britain's Jewish community in the second half of the nineteenth century by establishing one of London's most successful merchant banks. Their sons and grandsons, however, failed to show a similar distinction as merchant bankers, and were distracted from business by other interests. The firm had become little more than a name by the mid-twentieth century. A shrewd commentator noted in 1944 that<blockquote>As the Sterns' wealth increased their spirit of enterprise declined; in the new generation fewer and fewer transactions were promoted and today Stern Brothers is little more than an office for the payment of the coupons on the loans they have issued in the past. (Emden, 543)</blockquote>
