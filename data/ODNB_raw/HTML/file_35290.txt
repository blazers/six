<span class="headword">O'Doherty <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kelly]</span>,  Mary Anne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Eva of <i>The Nation</i>]</span>  (1830&#150;1910), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 15 February 1830 at Headford, co. Galway, the daughter of Edward Kelly, a country gentleman, and his wife, Mary O'Flaherty. One of seven children, she spent her childhood at Headford. She was educated by governesses, one of whom encouraged her literary talents, which she soon turned to nationalist ends, perhaps influenced by her cousin John Blake Dillon and her uncle Martin O'Flaherty, who were both Young Irelanders.<br>
<br>After her poem &#145;The Leprechaun&#146; appeared in the Young Ireland newspaper <span class="italic">The Nation</span> on 28 December 1844 under the signature Fionnuala, she began writing passionate nationalist verses under the signature Eva for <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and then for John Mitchel's <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> and the <span class="italic">Irish Felon</span> and the <span class="italic">Irish Tribune</span>. Her most famous poems were &#145;Down Britannia&#146; and &#145;The Men in Jail for Ireland&#146;. In 1848, during a visit to her uncle, a Dublin solicitor active on behalf of imprisoned Young Irelanders, she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35289/', "Kevin Izod O'Doherty (1823&#150;1905)")</script>, a young medical student imprisoned for his nationalist political activities. They became engaged before O'Doherty was convicted and sentenced to transportation to Van Diemen's Land in 1849. Her promise to wait for him, his clandestine return to Ireland after he was partially pardoned in 1854, and their subsequent marriage became the stuff of romantic nationalist legend. John Mitchel celebrated the love of his fellow exile O'Doherty for Eva, as she had become known, &#145;a dark-eyed lady, a fair and gentle lady, with hair like blackest midnight; and in the tangle of those silken tresses she has bound my poor friend's soul&#146;  (J. Mitchel, <span class="italic">Jail Journal</span>, 254).<br>
<br>Kevin O'Doherty and Mary Anne Kelly were married in London on 23 August 1855 and again in Paris on 30 November 1855 so that his presence in London, which violated the conditions of his partial pardon, would not be known. O'Doherty completed his medical studies in Paris and, after he received a full pardon in 1856, in Dublin, where the first of their eight children was born in May 1856. In 1859 they emigrated to Australia, where Kevin O'Doherty practised medicine, first in Sydney and eventually in Brisbane. Mary Anne devoted her energies to raising her young family, but her correspondence revealed her continuing literary aspirations. After the birth of her fourth child in 1860, she published forty poems in the <span class="italic">Sydney Freemen's Journal</span>, many of which expressed an exile's longing for Ireland and a continued commitment to social justice for the poor and oppressed.<br>
<br>Mary Anne O'Doherty and her husband were active in church and political circles with fellow emigrants from Ireland. She wrote verse in commemoration of the Daniel O'Connell centenary in 1875 and the Thomas Moore centenary in 1879. <span class="italic">Poems by Eva of &#145;The Nation&#146;</span>, published in San Francisco in 1877, represented the full range of her poetic output: fervent nationalist verse, passionate love poetry, and melancholy musings on life and death. Passionate, popular, and effective political propaganda, her conventional themes and mediocre verses are now only of historical interest.<br>
<br>Eva's poetry and her romantic courtship and marriage earned her a place in Irish national legend which has overlooked the tragic aspects of her life. After an initially successful medical career, her husband's Irish nationalism and support for the Land League adversely affected his medical practice. Three of their children died in infancy, and of the five who lived to be adults only their daughter Gertrude survived her parents. Between 1890 and 1900 four sons died, and Kevin O'Doherty went blind. He died on 15 July 1905. In 1909 a testimonial in Australia and the publication of a collection of her poems in Dublin raised some money for the impoverished Eva, who died of influenza in Brisbane the following year on 21 May 1910. She was buried in Brisbane, beside her husband.<br>
