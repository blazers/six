</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holme,  Vera Louise</span>  (1881&#150;1969), <span class="occ">actress and suffragette</span>, was born on 29 August 1881 at 6 Lulworth Road, Birkdale, Lancashire, the daughter of Richard Holme, a timber merchant, and his wife, Mary Louisa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Crowe). Nothing is known for certain of her education; she may have spent some of her youth in a convent school in France. She was an accomplished violinist and singer and by 1908 was a member of the chorus of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Vera Holme became involved in the militant women's suffrage movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and, in 1908, the Actresses' Franchise League. Sylvia Pankhurst described her as &#145;a noisy, explosive young person, frequently rebuked by her elders for lack of dignity&#146;  (Pankhurst, 225).<br>
<br>The 7 May 1909 issue of <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, the WSPU's weekly paper, contained a poem, &#145;An Organ Record&#146;, written by Vera Holme to commemorate her escapade on 2 May, when, with another suffragette, she hid after an evening concert inside the organ in the Colston Hall, Bristol, staying there all night and the next day in order to call out &#145;Votes for women&#146; during the course of a meeting being held by a government minister that evening. She was an adept horsewoman and appeared, mounted, as a marshal at many WSPU demonstrations. In late 1909 she became chauffeur to the leaders of the WSPU, Mrs Pankhurst and Mrs Pethick-Lawrence, wearing a striking uniform in the WSPU colours, with a smart peaked cap, decorated with her RAC badge of efficiency. Her hair was now cut decidedly short and in November 1909 she appeared as Hannah Snell, the woman who went to war disguised as a soldier, in Cicely Hamilton's <span class="italic">Pageant of Great Women</span>, a propaganda play staged by the suffrage societies. In November 1911 Vera Holme was sentenced to five days' imprisonment on a charge of stone-throwing; this appears to have been her only prison sentence. Through the suffrage movement she met and became a very close friend of the Hon. Evelina Haverfield, with whom she lived in Devon from 1911. It was probably about this time that she acquired the nickname Jack or Jacko.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War Vera Holme joined the Women's Volunteer Reserve, and was commissioned a major on 1 October 1914. She served in the transport unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital from 1915 to 1916, in charge of horses and trucks, working with Mrs Haverfield. In October 1917 Vera Holme was entrusted by Dr Elsie Inglis with the details of a report on the situation of the Serb army at the Romanian front. She and another member of the Scottish Women's Hospital team were instructed when they returned to England to present the full report in person to Lord Robert Cecil of the Foreign Office and Lord Derby, the secretary of state for war. After the end of the war and the death of Evelina Haverfield, who left her a small annuity, Vera Holme was the administrator of the Haverfield Fund for Serbian Children. She kept in touch with Serbian friends and visited the country again in 1934. She lived in Scotland, at Allt Griannach, Lochearnhead, Perthshire, and was associated with the artistic set that centred on Kirkcudbright. Its leader, Jessie M. King, designed a most appropriate book-plate for her, depicting an armoured Joan of Arc figure with the legend &#145;O Freedom Beautiful Beyond Compare Thy Kingdom is Established&#146;, presumably marking women's emancipation. She was twice painted by the Edinburgh artist Dorothy Johnstone. Vera Holme had been an acting member of the Pioneer Players from 1914 to 1915 and from 1917 to 1920, and remained a lifelong friend of Edith Craig, the daughter of Ellen Terry, for many years helping to stage the annual Ellen Terry memorial performance in the Barn Theatre at Smallhythe in Kent. Vera Holme died at 50 St Andrew's Drive, Glasgow, on 1 January 1969 of renal failure and arteriosclerosis.<br>
