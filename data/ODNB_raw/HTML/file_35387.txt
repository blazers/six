<span class="headword">Parker,  Louis Napoleon</span>  (1852&#150;1944), <span class="occ">musician and playwright</span>, was born at Luc-sur-Mer in Calvados, France, on 21 October 1852, the only son of an American, Charles Albert Parker, and his wife, Elizabeth Moray, an Englishwoman. His grandfather, Isaac Parker (1768&#150;1830), had been chief justice of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts; his father was a lawyer too, but in 1840, at the age of thirty-nine, he abandoned his profession and began a wandering life in Europe, seldom caring to remain more than a year in any one place. He was temporarily absent when his son was born, and as the child was thought to be dying and the mother could then speak no French, the Frenchman who baptized him named him after the then ruler of France, Louis Napoleon. In his eventual English career these names, together with the dark hair and skin which he inherited from his mother, gave him an exotic stamp, despite his intense pro-English feeling.<br>
<br>Parker's first fourteen years were spent with his parents, wandering in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and France&#151;though chiefly the first two. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Several of my Lives</span> (1928), contains vivid descriptions of those countries before 1866. The boy's first language was Italian, to which he soon added German and French; English was a later acquisition. His regular education was inevitably haphazard, but from his earliest years he was taken constantly to operas and plays, and so obtained an intimate sense of the stage and an everyday familiarity with music. In 1866 his parents took him to England, but still kept wandering, and his first settled education began when he was seventeen, when he was sent to the Royal Academy of Music, of which the principal was then William Sterndale Bennett. In 1898, after retiring from his musical career, Parker became a fellow of the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>At the academy Parker quickly came to the fore, as singer, pianist, and organist. In 1873 Sterndale Bennett, whose son James was director of music at Sherborne School in Dorset, asked Parker to go there for six weeks as locum tenens for the piano master. He went, and stayed there for nineteen years, succeeding James Bennett as organist and director of music in 1877. On 7 August 1878 he married Georgiana Bessie Calder (<i>c</i>.1853&#150;1919), the eldest daughter of Charles Calder, a merchant, in Sherborne Abbey church. They had two daughters, Elsa and Dorothy, of whom the latter attained some distinction on the stage. Parker spent many eventful years in Sherborne, for he not only raised the school's music to a higher level than any public school had until then attained, he also made the town a musical centre whose influence radiated far over Somerset and Dorset. He was one of the first English Wagnerians, an early member of the original Wagner Society and, after it ended, president of its successor. He was also a composer with a distinct vein of his own: he equipped Sherborne School with a remarkable set of school songs; of his three cantatas, two, <span class="italic">Silvia</span> (published 1880) and <span class="italic">Young Tamlane</span>, best display his gift for melody. But two things ended this career&#151;a temporary but disastrous decline of Sherborne School and, more serious, the onset of deafness. The latter left him no future in teaching, conducting, or choir-training.<br>
<br>Fortunately another occupation lay ready for Parker. For some years his dramatic bent had impelled him to attempt plays and, before he left Sherborne for London in 1892, he had had three successes with short pieces and two long ones accepted. Yet his new career was very uphill. Only dauntless tenacity and fertility carried him through. In November 1893, with <span class="italic">Gudgeons</span> (in collaboration with Murray Carson), he attained big box-office success both in London and in America, which he first visited in 1897. In 1896 <span class="italic">Rosemary</span> (again with Carson) became equally popular, and for the next twenty years Parker was one of the best-known playwrights in both countries. His most famous plays were <span class="italic">The Cardinal</span> (1903), <span class="italic">Disraeli</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Drake</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Joseph and his Brethren</span> (1913), and (with W. W. Jacobs) <span class="italic">Beauty and the Barge</span> (1904); to which may be added <span class="italic">Pomander Walk</span> (1910), which for years broke records in America, though (through bad casting) it failed in London. Parker was also an admirable translator, as demonstrated by <span class="italic">L'Aiglon</span> and <span class="italic">Rosmersholm</span>, and adaptor, as seen in <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span>, <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span>, and <span class="italic">The Monkey's Paw</span> by Jacobs. Many of his London triumphs were obtained at His Majesty's Theatre under Sir Herbert Tree, but they were often preceded by great successes in America.<br>
<br>Parker's third career&#151;pageant-making&#151;overlapped with the second. It began in 1905 with the pageant at Sherborne. Parker had never ceased to love the town, and the precincts of its ruined Norman castle gave him a perfect arena. The success of this pageant&#151;which with 900 participants achieved seven performances&#151;was quite outstanding; and requests poured in from elsewhere. By 1909 he had organized five more pageants on a great scale&#151;at Warwick, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester, York, and Dover&#151;besides a few smaller ones. His pageants essentially expressed the settled, prosperous life of England as it was before the world wars. He himself became a British subject two months before the outbreak of war in 1914. From 1907 until then he organized and greatly improved the historical section of the lord mayor's show.<br>
<br>The last two decades of Parker's very long life were spent chiefly at Bishopsteignton in Devon. In 1936, when he was eighty-four, two things pleased him very much&#151;the very successful filming of his play <span class="italic">Disraeli</span>, written for George Arliss, and the choice of his <span class="italic">Lily of France</span> (Joan of Arc) by the city of Nancy for its annual production, which, though interrupted by the Second World War, was afterwards resumed. His last published work was a poem, &#145;Fathers and Sons&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 21 September 1939. He died at Inverteign, Bishopsteignton, on 21 September 1944.<br>
