<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cadbury, Dame  Geraldine Southall</span>  (1865&#150;1941), <span class="occ">social and penal reformer</span>, was born Geraldine Southall at 5 Highfield Road, Edgbaston, on 29 June 1865, the daughter of Alfred Southall (1838&#150;1931), chemist, and his wife, Anna Strangman, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grubb (1841&#150;1912). She inherited a propensity for social activism from her Quaker parents; her father was a temperance worker who taught a working men's adult school class, while her Irish mother was a supporter of women's suffrage. She was educated at Edgbaston High School for Girls, and briefly at the Quaker school, The Mount, in York. On 8 September 1891, at the Friends' meeting house, Birmingham, she married <a href="#cosubject_">Barrow Cadbury [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had three children: Dorothy Adlington (1892&#150;1987), Paul Strangman (1895&#150;1984), and Geraldine Mary (1900&#150;1999).<br>
<br>A committed Quaker, Geraldine Southall Cadbury reconciled her faith with the couple's increasing wealth by engaging in social reform; throughout her life, her activism was motivated by her Quaker faith. In 1904 she began a lifelong connection with the Birmingham Lying-in Charity and its services to poor mothers, officially opening its new maternity hospital buildings in Loveday Street in November 1907. She and her husband donated a nurses' hostel in 1933, and shortly before her death she was planning the hospital's new premises. Among her educational interests were the Birmingham People's Free Kindergarten established by Julia Lloyd in 1904, and the provision of open-air schools for inner-city children, the latter drawing on her own maternal experience. The health of her elder son as a child had caused concern and in 1907 the couple built a family home, Cropwood, in the Lickey Hills, designed on open-air principles. Seeing the beneficial effects on their own child, the Cadburys donated two open-air schools to Birmingham, Uffculme in 1911, and Cropwood itself in 1922.<br>
<br>Cadbury's other educational concerns were the Sunday school class where she taught from 1905, and her women's adult school class at Moseley Road which she led from 1907. In 1907 she and Barrow Cadbury founded Westhill Training College for Sunday School Workers, providing the building and most of the project's financial support. Her part in its establishment was recognized in 1917 by the National Sunday School Union when she was elected as its first woman president. In her presidential address, &#145;Stand by the children&#146;, she announced her campaign for the year, the &#145;difficult boy and girl&#146; and the Sunday school's role in their reclamation for society, thereby uniting her interest in Sunday schools with the cause for which she is best remembered, the reform of the treatment of young offenders.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1905 at the instigation of a local justice, J. Courtney Lord, Birmingham established the first separate court for children in England. Modelled on American children's courts, the experiment led to the provision of juvenile courts in the <span class="roman">Children's Act</span> of 1908. In the same year as the court's inception Cadbury was invited by a fellow Quaker, Ellen Sturge, to accompany her on her regular visits to the courts. Together with Marian Priestman, another local Friend, she became a volunteer probation worker, supervising the case of every girl offender, investigating her home circumstances, and advising the appropriate course of action. She followed this up after sentencing by corresponding with every girl, always enclosing a stamped addressed envelope for a reply. Her work convinced her of the need for a safe home where children could be accommodated while on remand, and in 1910 she and Barrow Cadbury provided Birmingham with the first purpose-built children's remand home in Britain. They donated the site on the Moseley Road, established a voluntary management committee under their direction, and paid for the erection and furnishing of the building, which was largely designed by her. As for other buildings donated by the couple she drew detailed sketches of what she required, which were then handed to the architect to work up into building plans.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Cadbury organized temporary accommodation for hundreds of Belgian refugees at the Friends' Institute in Moseley Road and ran a Belgian maternity home at 19 Carpenter Road, receiving the medal of Queen Elisabeth of Belgium in 1918 in recognition of her services. A committed pacifist, she was one of the 156 members of the British committee of the Women's International Congress at The Hague (28 April &#150; 1 May 1915), to which she and her daughter Dorothy had intended to travel but were refused passports.<br>
<br>In the post-war period Cadbury was increasingly recognized as an expert on juvenile justice policy locally and nationally. Between 1911 and 1927 she was co-opted onto Birmingham education committee's special school sub-committee. In 1920, following the <span class="roman">Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act</span> of 1919, her position in Birmingham children's court was formalized when she and Marian Priestman became the city's first two women magistrates, and from 1923 she chaired the justices' panel in the children's court. In 1922 she was appointed to the Home Office's advisory committee on probation, and in 1925 to the Home Office departmental committee on the treatment of young offenders, the committee that laid the ground for the <span class="roman">Children's Act</span> of 1933.<br>
<br>As part of her investigations for the young offenders committee, Cadbury visited Maurice Rouvroy's Belgian observation home for young delinquents in 1926. Established in 1913 the Centraal Observatiegesticht at Moll was a child-centred community where young offenders were psychologically assessed. Cadbury had a long-standing interest in psychology; Dr George Auden acted as psychological adviser to her Moseley Road Remand Home from its establishment, and from the early 1920s the Birmingham children's court used two local doctors, W. A. Potts and Hamblin Smith, as experts in child psychology. The visit to Moll convinced her of the value of observation homes and when the young offenders committee reported in 1927 it recommended that at least three British observation centres should be established to provide psychological reports on all offenders under the age of twenty-one. Much to her disappointment, and that of the Howard League, financial constraints prevented the recommendation's inclusion in the <span class="roman">Children's Act</span> of 1933, and it was not until after her death that the first British observation home was established in Birmingham, by her husband and in her memory.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Cadbury took part in campaigns against the death penalty, and from 1923 supported the work of what later became the National Council for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. She also travelled widely, investigating juvenile justice provision in Europe, America, New Zealand, and Australia, often combining her interests with Barrow's business travels and visits to Quaker international gatherings. In 1928 the fruits of her travels fed into her designs for a new children's court complex in Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, only the second purpose-built juvenile court in England. Presented to the city by the couple, the court was officially opened by the home secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, on 17 July 1928. Her beliefs were incorporated into its fabric in the form of the ceremonial key which showed Justice unveiled and without a sword, symbolizing justice with understanding.<br>
<br>Cadbury was instrumental in the establishment of the Birmingham Child Guidance Clinic, founded by Birmingham city council's education committee in 1931, initially for an experimental period of three years. It was funded by the Commonwealth Fund of New York supplemented by an anonymous local donation of &pound;1500, which may well have come from her. In 1935 she and Barrow Cadbury founded Copeley Hill Hostel for boys and Carpenter House Probation Hostel for girls. She also continued to be appointed to Home Office committees, including the committee to inquire into juvenile courts in the Metropolitan Police district (1930&#150;41), the juvenile court rules committee (1932), the conference on girls aged 15&#150;17 appearing before London juvenile courts (1934), and the committee to consider observation centres (1938). From 1935 she was vice-president of the International Association of Children's Court Judges. Her book <span class="italic">Young Offenders Yesterday and To-day</span> (1938) stressed the transformative power of education and personal intervention in the lives of the young, and articulated her long-held belief that the juvenile court was there to protect rather than to punish, and that child offenders were not intrinsically flawed but were reacting to their environment, poverty, poor parenting, and a lack of alternative role models.<br>
<br>In May 1937 Geraldine Cadbury was appointed DBE &#145;for public and philanthropic services in Birmingham&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 11 May 1937, 3089), a worldly honour that as a Quaker she seriously considered declining. She rarely used the title, preferring to be known as Mrs Barrow Cadbury. She died at her home, 40 Edgbaston Park Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 30 January 1941.<br>
<br>She was survived by her husband, <a name="cosubject_103380"></a><span class="headword">Barrow Cadbury</span>  (1862&#150;1958), <span class="occ">cocoa and chocolate manufacturer and social reformer</span>, who was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 27 September 1862, the son of Richard Cadbury (1835&#150;1899), cocoa manufacturer, and his first wife, Elizabeth Adlington (1838&#150;1868). His mother died when he was six years old. After schooling locally, at the age of eleven he was sent to a <i>Realschule</i> in Stuttgart, before attending a Quaker school at Hitchin from the age of fourteen. This was followed by two years at Owens College, Manchester, and an apprenticeship in London. In 1882 he completed a two-month tour of Canada and the USA, investigating American chocolate manufacture, before joining the family firm. On his father's death he became one of four directors of a new limited company under the chairmanship of his uncle, George Cadbury. From 1914 Barrow was vice-chairman of Cadbury Brothers Ltd. In 1918 he negotiated a merger, against his uncle's wishes, with J. S. Fry &amp; Sons of Bristol to form a new holding company, the British Cocoa and Chocolate Company. On George Cadbury's death in 1922 Barrow became chairman of Cadbury Brothers Ltd until his retirement in 1932.<br>
<br>Quiet and reserved, Barrow Cadbury's Quaker faith and pacifist principles were central to his life. He was active in his local meeting at George Road and from 1898 at Highgate Mission. In the same year he was made an elder of the Warwickshire monthly meeting and later served as clerk to the quarterly meeting. Nationally he was a regular attender at yearly meeting and a member of the meeting for sufferings. In 1923 he played a key role in the building of Friends' House in Euston Road, London, raising much of the necessary funds as treasurer of the building committee. Like his father, he had a lifelong interest in adult education and taught a working men's class throughout his life. Following his father's death he inherited the management of his recently built Moseley Road Institute for adult education. He served on the council of the National Adult School Union and was its treasurer (1907&#150;22), and president (1926&#150;7).<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Barrow Cadbury was involved in Anglo-German friendship initiatives, hosting visits by German peace delegations in 1906 and 1911, and participating in several return delegations to Germany, the last shortly before the outbreak of war in 1914. During the war he was an early member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation in 1915, and supported the work of the Friends' War Victims Relief Committee, the Friends' Emergency Committee for the Relief of Enemy Aliens, and the Friends' Ambulance Unit in which his son, Paul, served. He maintained his witness for peace during the 1930s when he supported George Lansbury's Embassies of Reconciliation initiative. After the Second World War he collaborated with a fellow Quaker, Kathleen Lonsdale, on a series of letters to world leaders pressing for peace and disarmament, the last of which was written in 1957 a few months before his death.<br>
<br>Barrow Cadbury shared his wife's interest in penal reform and served as a magistrate from 1906 to 1940, often presiding in the children's court. Following Geraldine's death Barrow Cadbury continued to support the causes she espoused, and purchased Forhill House intending to establish an observation home for young offenders in her memory. However, delays with Forhill prompted him to begin experimental work at Fircroft College, Selly Oak, where her Moseley Road Remand Home had been evacuated following bomb damage, and which in effect became the first British observation home. He persevered with Forhill, which was officially opened on 30 May 1947 as a Senior Boys' Remand and Observation Home and presented to the city in Geraldine Cadbury's memory.<br>
<br>In 1920 the couple had converted a large proportion of their fortune into the charitable Barrow Cadbury Trust. Birmingham Civic Society awarded its gold medal to them in 1931 in recognition of their contribution to the city. Although he never coveted public honour and often worked anonymously, Barrow Cadbury was granted the freedom of the city of Birmingham in 1932. He died at his home, 73 Wellington Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 9 March 1958.<br>
