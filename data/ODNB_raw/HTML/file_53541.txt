<span class="headword">Humber,  Thomas</span>  (1841&#150;1910), <span class="occ">bicycle manufacturer</span>, was born in Andrew Street, Brightside, Sheffield, on 16 October 1841, the son of Samuel Humber, a tailor, and his wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turton. The family later moved from Sheffield to Hull and, in 1854, to Nottingham, where Thomas worked for a blacksmith and wheelwright; although not formally apprenticed, he used the opportunity to develop his practical experience and broaden his knowledge. Around 1860 he moved to the Butterley Iron Company at Alfreton in Derbyshire where he demonstrated his entrepreneurial skills with his proposal for a low cost way of producing deck beams for two naval ships. His tender was accepted, to the satisfaction of both Humber and his employer. Within a few years he returned to Nottingham and set up in business as a blacksmith. He married in Nottingham, on 5 April 1863, Emma Elizabeth (1842/3&#150;1903), daughter of William Freeman, tailor; they had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1868, the <span class="italic">English Mechanic</span> magazine published a letter about the velocipede, the predecessor of the bicycle, which had been developed in Paris. This captured the interest of Humber who used a picture in the magazine as the basis for the design of a machine he built for himself at home. It took him some time to learn how to ride the new cycle but eventually he made the journey from Nottingham to Radcliffe, a distance of about six miles. His second machine incorporated a number of significant improvements but not before the first one had attracted attention, giving Humber his first sale. The same customer also bought the second one. Production of each of these velocipedes took two months, not least due to the importance that Humber attached to the quality and reliability of his products. He also continued to innovate, such as by introducing solid rubber tyres to improve the ride, by use of ball-bearings and by instituting races to attract interest to the new machines.<br>
<br>In 1871 Humber produced his own version of the &#145;ordinary&#146; cycle (or &#145;penny-farthing&#146;), not long after James Starley had completed the first all-metal ordinary. Humber called his machine the Spider. Its durability was testified by various users in his first price list which he published in 1873. One of these testimonials was from Fred Cooper, a racing cyclist. Another contact from the sport was Thomas Marriott who joined Humber as a business partner in 1875. Two years later Fred Cooper also became a partner and the enterprise was renamed Humber, Marriott and Cooper. By that time the workforce was around eighty and their works were no longer large enough, so a new factory was constructed at Beeston.<br>
<br>Ordinaries were capable of speed but they were far from safe, especially for the novice. An alternative was the tricycle, which was also used for racing. Humber developed a design using a new configuration of front steering and rear drive, an arrangement which remained in use. Robert Cripps rode this to success in races, to such an extent that Humber's tricycle became known as the Cripper. But the important goal was a &#145;safety&#146; bicycle which Humber achieved in 1884. His patented design put the larger wheel at the rear, rather than at the front as was the case with the ordinary; it also made use of a diamond-shaped frame, which was to become the norm in bicycles; this was soon followed by other designs, ones that more closely resembled later models with front and rear wheels of nearly equal size. Nevertheless the ordinary and the tricycle continued in production for some years.<br>
<br>In 1885 Cooper and Marriott left the partnership, establishing themselves as a wholesaler of cycles and, later, selling cycles made for them by Rudge of Coventry. Humber allowed them equal rights to the Humber name, as well as use of the old partnership's patents, which led to a legal dispute some years later, demonstrating the commercial value of the Humber brand but also giving an indication that Thomas's commercial abilities were, perhaps, not as sharp as his technical skills.<br>
<br>Humber then entered into partnership with his long-standing associate T. Harrison Lambert. In 1887 Humber and Lambert's business became the subject of an early consolidation of the British cycle industry when it and three other companies were acquired by investors, who rapidly sold them all to a newly formed public company. Even though some of the constituent companies had greater production than Humber's, it was his name which was given to the new company, reflecting its association with quality and reliability. Thomas Humber agreed to become general manager of the new company for five years, including responsibility for overseeing manufacturing at all of its sites&#151;Coventry and Wolverhampton as well as Beeston. Although the Coventry works produced less expensive models, the Humber name and the association with Beeston were used by salesmen to imply high quality of its products.<br>
<br>After he had completed the agreed term as general manager Thomas Humber retired in 1892; his son and the manager of the Beeston works left at this time too, forming a new bicycle-making company with Robert Cripps. Humber became a director of a neighbouring enterprise developing another of his interests, the pneumatic tyre. But the Humber name was jealously guarded by his old company which took Thomas Humber to court in 1896, insisting that he keep to the terms of his severance agreement, especially not to become a director of companies in related fields, in this case the British Motor Syndicate Ltd, an early motor car venture. By then the first motorcycles bearing the Humber name were being developed at Coventry and a motor car at Wolverhampton. In 1907 the whole company was concentrated in Coventry enabling Humber to become the second largest manufacturer of cars in the UK within six years. The cycle division was eventually sold to Raleigh in 1932.<br>
<br>By 1881 Humber's relationship with his wife had deteriorated such that they were living apart&#151;he shared a house in Beeston with his younger brother, Samuel, while his wife continued to live in Nottingham. Emma unsuccessfully petitioned for divorce in 1886. By 1901 Humber had retired to Teddington, near London, living as man and wife with Eleanor Robinson (<i>b</i>. 1872), a Nottingham native and his junior by thirty years. They married at Paddington, London, on 9 September 1903, barely a month after Emma Humber's death on 8 August. They moved to Villa D'Arno, Albany Park, Kingston upon Thames, where Humber died of cancer on 24 November 1910.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Thomas Humber displayed an independence of ideas, as well as supreme practical abilities which he used to improve cycle technology. His contacts with racing not only attracted business but also stimulated developments in the technology. He set high standards which were reflected in the reliability of the cycles he produced, achieved not least through his control of the production of all of the components. Through his emphasis on quality, Thomas made the Humber the aristocrat among bicycles.<br>
