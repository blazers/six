<span class="headword">Sclater,  Philip Lutley</span>  (1829&#150;1913), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born on 4 November 1829 at Tangier Park, Hampshire, the second son of William Lutley Sclater (1789&#150;1885) and Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowyer (<i>d</i>. 1879). He was educated at Winchester College (1842&#150;5), whence he obtained a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1846&#150;9). He received a first in mathematics in 1849 and remained at Oxford for a further two years, studying natural history and modern languages. In 1851 he entered Lincoln's Inn and practised on the western circuit for a number of years after his call to the bar.<br>
<br>Sclater was an accomplished ornithologist, and he published a number of articles in the journals of the Linnean and Zoological societies. His most important paper was &#145;On the general geographic distribution of the members of the class aves&#146;. This paper identified six zoogeographic regions of the world according to their bird life. This concept was developed by subsequent writers and Sclater's terminology remains in use to this day. He was a frequent traveller to Europe and often stayed with the ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in Paris. His first visit to America was in 1856 when he travelled on foot and by birch-bark canoe as far as the Mississippi and met leading American naturalists. Subsequent journeys took him back to North America, to north and south Africa, and to Europe. He contributed four volumes to the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Birds at the British Museum</span>.<br>
<br>In 1850 Sclater became a fellow of the Zoological Society of London and in 1857 a member of its council. In 1859 he was elected secretary of the society. The financial and scientific affairs of the society were not in good order at that time. Sclater ensured that the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> were published at the due time, and that the library was greatly improved. In 1886 responsibility for the <span class="italic">Zoological Record</span> (founded in 1864) was assumed by the Zoological Society on his initiative. Other activities included the founding in 1858 of <span class="italic">Ibis</span>, the journal of the British Ornithologists' Union, which he edited (apart from the years 1865&#150;77) until 1913.<br>
<br>In 1861 Sclater was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and in 1862 he married Jane Anne Eliza Hunter-Blair (<i>d</i>. 1915), daughter of Sir David Hunter-Blair, third baronet. They had one daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom, William Lutley (1863&#150;1944), was also an ornithologist and succeeded his father as editor of <span class="italic">Ibis</span> (1913&#150;30).<br>
<br>Sclater's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24844/', "George Sclater-Booth (later Lord Basing)")</script>, was appointed president of the Local Government Board by Disraeli in 1874 and for two years Sclater acted as his private secretary. However he declined a permanent position as this would take him from his study of natural history. In 1892 he was elected chairman of the British Ornithologists' Club.<br>
<br>During Sclater's period as secretary, many new buildings were erected in the zoological gardens, but he was more anxious to secure that a rare species should be added to the official list than that it should be sedulously cared for. Before his retirement in 1902, his administration of the zoological gardens was subjected to mounting and justified criticism. He made a poor impression when giving evidence to the society's reorganization committee and although he persuaded the council to nominate his son William as secretary, he was not elected by the fellows.<br>
<br>Sclater was always very helpful to other zoologists, but this was marred by an arrogant and dictatorial manner. His retirement was spent in Hampshire where he was an active and by far the oldest member of the Hampshire hunt. He died at his home, Odiham Priory, as a result of a carriage accident on 27 June 1913.<br>
