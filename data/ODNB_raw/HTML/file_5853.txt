<span class="headword">Cole,  Humfrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1591), <span class="occ">mathematical instrument maker and die sinker</span>, described himself as &#145;a English man born in y<sup>e</sup> north&#146; (on a map of Palestine engraved in 1572), but neither the date or place of his birth nor his parents are known. Although the form of his name varies on his signed works, &#145;Humfrey Cole&#146; is the most commonly used. The circumstances of his education are unclear, but he claimed on the map to be a goldsmith, and was referred to as such on 6 September 1577 in the Goldsmiths' court minutes, when a William Sysyswithe, formerly apprentice of Robert Fyllischurche, was turned over to him in order to complete his apprenticeship. For about fifteen years Cole was active as a die sinker at the mint in the Tower, where he first appears in 1563 as the established successor to John Lawrence. Throughout his tenure his salary was &pound;20 per annum, an amount which he claimed in 1578 to be &#145;lacking sufficiente maintenance for me and my family&#146;  (Ackermann, 21), although it was in addition to lodgings in the Tower and a further &pound;3 per annum &#145;diett&#146; allowance.<br>
<br>This is the last evidence of Cole's employment in the mint, and he seems to have continued to sell &#145;Geometricall instruments in metall&#146; at his house &#145;neere unto the North dore of Paules&#146;  (Worsop). Twenty-six spectacular mathematical instruments by Cole are known to have survived, all but one in public collections in the British Isles and on the continent. His work, which dates from 1568 to 1590, covered a wide time-span, including the period when he was still employed at the mint, where he paid a deputy for at least two years to do his work for half his salary. Cole was mentioned by name in the original account books of the first Frobisher voyage in 1576; he is the only one named among the makers who provided instruments for the expedition. He was also called upon when the instruments needed repair after the first journey, and again in 1578, to take part in the assay of the ore returned from Frobisher Bay, which was claimed to contain gold and silver.<br>
<br>Cole's 1572 map of Palestine was for Richard Jugge's <span class="roman">Bishops' Bible</span>. The only surviving map by Cole, it is based on an earlier map by Abraham Ortelius and appears to have served mainly as an advertisement of his engraving skills; it was probably intended to impress Elizabeth I's leading minister, Lord Burghley, who had expressed a strong interest in the mapping of England and Wales for administrative purposes. Nothing is known about Cole's family except for the name of his wife, Elizabeth, who was named as the beneficiary of an administration of 6 July 1591, issued one day after his burial, at St Gregory by Paul's, on 5 July.<br>
