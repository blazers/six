<span class="headword">Paget,  Stephen</span>  (1855&#150;1926), <span class="occ">writer and pro-vivisection campaigner</span>, was born on 17 July 1855 at 24 Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, London, the fifth child and fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21113/', "Sir James Paget, first baronet (1814&#150;1899)")</script>, surgeon, and his wife, Lydia (1815&#150;1895), daughter of the Revd Henry North, domestic chaplain to the duke of Kent. He attended Marylebone and All Souls' Grammar School, Regent's Park, London, before enrolling at Shrewsbury School, where his paternal uncle Alfred had been mathematics master. Paget remained there from 1870 to 1874. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 16 October 1874: he was Fell exhibitioner from 1876 to 1880, and in 1878 took second-class honours in classical moderations and Greats. While in Oxford he studied basic medical sciences, but did not seek a university medical degree. On 1 October 1878 he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school (where his father was no longer on the active staff). He served as house surgeon to Thomas Smith, once a student, now a friend of his father. He qualified FRCS in 1885 and took up medical practice.<br>
<br>Paget married, on 17 September 1885, Eleanor Mary (Nell) Burd (1853/4&#150;1933), second daughter of Edward Burd, a Shrewsbury physician. A talented painter, she studied at the Slade School before their marriage, and Paget had a studio built for her at their home, 57 Wimpole Street. The couple had two daughters, Eleanor (<i>b</i>. 1888) and Dorothea (<i>b</i>. 1890).<br>
<br>Paget's medical career did not prove to be as successful as his father's. He had a brief sojourn at the Western General Dispensary, gained full surgical appointments at the Metropolitan and West London hospitals, and served as assistant in the surgical out-patients' department at the children's hospital, Great Ormond Street. However, to his great disappointment, in seven years there he failed to win a post on the surgical staff. Furthermore, none of these institutions had the prestige of the teaching hospitals. His only appointment of this sort came late; in 1897 he was named aural surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital, becoming consulting surgeon in 1917. Paget abandoned general surgery in 1897 at the age of forty-two, and in 1910 he ceased practising medicine until 1917, during the First World War.<br>
<br>Contemporaries said he was unsuited to a surgical career. He himself later recalled that he never made an adequate living from his practice, earning &#145;only a few hundred pounds a year&#146;  (&#145;Oct 5th, 1925, etc.&#146;, 10, in S. Paget, &#145;Memoir&#146;). His medical career was always carried out in the shadow of his father's success. In <span class="italic">Confessio medici</span> (1908) Paget warned young men of the dangers of following in a distinguished father's profession. He likened the outcome to that of Icarus trying to fly on wings his father had made, and falling instead into the sea. Two decades later he expressed this view more personally: &#145;I know that I achieved some good &hellip; saved some lives &hellip;. But the cloud of regrets and mistakes is over the whole thing, and if I could start again, I could not be a surgeon&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, 117).<br>
<br>While his surgical career disappointed him, Paget found gratification in other spheres: particularly in the arena of medical politics and propaganda and in the world of letters. His activities as a propagandist resulted from his commitment to vivisection for medical research. The 1877 legislation to prevent cruelty to animals had led to the creation of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Research (AAMR), and Paget was named its secretary in 1888. By 1908 the AAMR was defunct, and Paget took the leadership in establishing a new body, the Research Defence Society (RDS), to support vivisection in medical research. He became honorary secretary, and served as editor of the society's journal, <span class="italic">The Fight Against Disease</span>. Between 1891 and his death Paget published a number of reports and essays on vivisection. He organized, lectured, and campaigned endlessly in support of the benefits that could come from the use of animals in medical research.<br>
<br>Paget's third (and perhaps most successful) career was that of biographer and essayist. Between 1897 and 1919 he published biographies of Ambroise Par&eacute;, John Hunter, Louis Pasteur, his father James, his brother-in-law H. L. Thompson (with his sister Catharine Paget Thompson), his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35355/', "Francis Paget")</script> (with J. M. C. Crum), his friend Henry Scott Holland, and the surgeon Sir Victor Horsley. Beginning with <span class="italic">The Young People</span> &#145;by one of the old people&#146; (1906), he established himself as an eloquent and accessible writer for young people (and often the elders as well). His self-deprecating humour, his classical learning, and his lack of self-righteousness made him a popular writer in his generation. His prose had a delicacy of touch that allowed him to take up potentially controversial subjects such as sex education and venereal disease without giving offence. Perhaps because he was the father of daughters, his writings always reflected his recognition that young people were both &#145;he&#146; and &#145;she&#146;.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war in 1914 Paget gave of his expertise and time to the health of soldiers. He lectured at military camps on hygiene and vaccination, and in 1916&#150;17 went to Russia, where he served on the staff of the Anglo-Russian Hospital in Petrograd. His health, never robust, deteriorated during his stay there, and he returned to England.<br>
<br>To some, Stephen Paget seemed shy, even diffident. Others found in him a warm friend. One contemporary said he was &#145;a delightful and lovable companion, one who drank the wine of life as a gentleman, thankful if the vintage were sound, tolerant of other men's tastes, and holding to conviction without intruding a strong religious feeling&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 May 1926). He retired, in ill health, in 1917, and died at his home, Furzedown, in Limpsfield, Surrey, on 8 May 1926.<br>
