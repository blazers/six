<span class="headword">Corbet,  Reynold</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1566), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the third son of Sir Robert Corbet (<i>d</i>. 1513) of Moreton Corbet, Shropshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Henry Vernon of Haddon, Derbyshire. The Middle Temple records no longer exist for most of the period of his membership, but he must have been admitted in the early 1530s and he became a bencher in 1552. Like Brooke, Dyer, and a number of other judicial contemporaries, he was trained as a pupil in the Middle Temple office of John Jenour. His reading in Lent 1552, on offices before escheators, was attended by Chief Justice Mountagu and three future chief justices (Serjeant Saunders, Brooke, and Dyer). Already as a junior barrister he had served as member of parliament (first for Wenlock, in 1542, and then for Shrewsbury), and had become recorder of Shrewsbury in 1547. He was also a justice of the peace for Shropshire.<br>
<br>At an unknown date Corbet married Alice, the daughter of John Gratewood of Wollerton, Shropshire. In 1553 he became a member of the council in the marches, and in 1558 a judge on the Anglesey circuit; soon after that he received a serjeant's writ, and was created at the general call in April 1559. On 16 October 1559 he was appointed a puisne justice of the queen's bench, and sat there for seven years. Dyer came close to accusing him of partiality in 1560 when, in the case of Lord Powis, he was the only judge supporting the plaintiff, Vernon, a member of his mother's family. He died on 19 November 1566, and was buried according to his testamentary directions at Stoke upon Tern, Shropshire, where there is an alabaster effigy in judicial robes, with his wife and children; around his shield of arms is a ribbon with the motto &#145;Corona lege fulcitur&#146; (&#145;The crown is secured by the law&#146;). His opinion in <i>Stowell v. Lord Zouche</i> had the strange distinction of being reported posthumously by Plowden; although he died before he was able to deliver it in court, an autograph draft was found in his study.<br>
<br>By his will, made at Stoke on 26 August 1566, Corbet made Alice his sole executor, and appointed as one of his overseers his nephew Sir Andrew Corbet (<i>d</i>. 1578), barrister of the Middle Temple and vice-president of the council in the marches. Though seated at Stoke, he also had property in Cheshire and Staffordshire. He left six sons and five daughters. His grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6288/', "Sir John Corbet")</script>, the politician, was created a baronet in 1627; the title became extinct in 1750.<br>
