<span class="headword">Smyth <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Smyth-Pigott]</span>,  John Hugh</span>  (1852&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Agapemonite leader</span>, was born at Brockley Court, near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, on 1 August 1852, the third son of Henry Thomas Coward Smyth Pigott (1823&#150;1858), formerly a captain in the Royal Scots Greys, and his wife, Elizabeth Drummond, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nairne (<i>d</i>. 1898). He attended Rossall School, Fleetwood, Lancashire, and matriculated from Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he remained for no more than a year (1871&#150;2). After a restless period, first in the merchant navy, later in Queensland, Australia (as a gold prospector), and in North America, he experienced an evangelical conversion through the preaching of Jerry McAuley of the Water Street Mission in New York. In 1879 he began to study for the Anglican ministry at the London College of Divinity, Highbury. Ordained a deacon in 1882 (and a priest in 1883), he served as a curate at St Jude's, Mildmay Park, but in 1884, seeking a platform better suited to zealous evangelism, he became a staff captain in the Salvation Army, taking part in a mission to Cambridge University (his account of which appeared in <span class="italic">War Cry</span>, 13 December 1884). He resigned from the Salvation Army in September&#150;October 1885. His engagement and marriage (14 August 1886) to the daughter of Henry Bion Reynolds, Catharine (1852&#150;1936), whose brother Alfred was vicar of Kingsley, Cheshire, may have encouraged his reconciliation with the Church of England. Earlier in 1886 he had returned to Cambridge, where his espousal of an extreme form of Christian perfectionism had been divisive in student evangelical circles. In November he was appointed as a curate at the Church of Ireland mission in Townsend Street, Dublin, but very soon his vicar, W. H. Fiske, &#145;turned him out&#146; because of his extreme views. In 1887 or soon after, Smyth-Pigott renewed his association with Douglas Hamilton, whom he had known at Cambridge but who had recently joined H. J. Prince's sect, the Agapemone at Spaxton, Somerset. Hamilton appears to have persuaded him that he too was called to work with, and possibly even succeed, Prince as the sect's leader.<br>
<br>Almost certainly Smyth-Pigott visited Spaxton and met Henry Prince but he soon moved back to his former haunts in London. By May 1889 he was living in Stoke Newington and was recognized by Prince as the sect's pastor in Clapton. In 1896 an Agapemonite chapel, known as the Ark of the New Covenant, was opened in Rookwood Road. Here, to the delight of his flock, Smyth-Pigott announced on 7 September 1902 that he was the Messiah. A more public proclamation the following Sunday evoked a scornful reaction from an indignant crowd. Shortly afterwards he moved to Spaxton, where he explained that he was the fulfilment of a process in which Prince had been the herald (or John the Baptist). Smyth-Pigott, the Messiah, had conveniently been born in 1852, just after Prince had rallied his followers with the proclamation &#145;Behold he Cometh&#146;.<br>
<br>Established as the new head, or &#145;heavenly bridegroom&#146;, of the community, Smyth-Pigott appears to have adopted Prince's dictatorial and arbitrary role, but the lethargy which had characterized the Agapemone in Prince's later years was transformed by the more active lifestyle of several younger recruits who, impressed by Smyth-Pigott's earlier ministry, brought to the community some fresh energy. Though enjoined to secrecy about the community's activities, members were encouraged to have some contact with their neighbours in Spaxton and to engage in charitable work. The need for secrecy was occasioned, at least in part, by the fact that Smyth-Pigott required his followers, including his wife, to abstain from sexual relations, but, like his predecessor, insisted that some of the female members were to be an order of &#145;soul-brides&#146;, from whose number he would be able to choose &#145;the bride of the Lamb&#146;. In the summer of 1904 Ruth Ann(e) Preece was designated as Smyth-Pigott's &#145;chief spiritual bride&#146; and it soon became apparent that the relationship was other than platonic. During the next six years she gave birth to three children, of whom Smyth-Pigott was the acknowledged father.<br>
<br>In January 1909, after a trial in the consistory court in Wells Cathedral on charges of improper behaviour, Smyth-Pigott, who had ignored the summons, was degraded from holy orders in his absence. The extent of Smyth-Pigott's promiscuity in subsequent years may have been exaggerated, but it was said that he abandoned Ruth Preece in favour of other soul-brides. In an attempt to regularize the status of his children, deeds were executed in 1914 whereby Smyth-Pigott and Ruth Preece both changed their surname to Smyth, while his legal wife became known as Mrs Pigott. Although these developments led to some indignant resignations from the community, Smyth did not confine his preaching to Spaxton, and his charm enabled him to retain a significant following in other Agapemonite centres in London and elsewhere, notably in Christiania, Norway, which he visited at least eight times between 1902 and 1926. By 1925, however, his health was failing, and on medical advice he remained abroad for some time. On his return a projected campaign in London had to be shelved, but he initiated some improvements to the buildings of the Abode at Spaxton. Smyth died there on 20 March 1927 and was buried in the grounds of the Agapemone.<br>
