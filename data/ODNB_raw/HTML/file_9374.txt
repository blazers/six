<span class="headword">Fetherston,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic ecclesiastic and martyr</span>, graduated BA at Cambridge University in 1499 or 1500 and received his MA at Oxford University in June 1505; while often referred to as &#145;doctor&#146; there is no evidence of his doctorate. He was rector of Sulhampstead Abbots, Hampshire, from an unknown date until 1519 and rector of Newnham, Hampshire (a living in the gift of Queen's College, Oxford), from 1519 to 1520. He was presented to the archdeaconry of Brecon on 8 April 1523 and probably kept it until January 1535; statements that he was also archdeacon of St David's seem to be incorrect. From about 1525 until at least 1533 he was schoolmaster to Princess Mary, having been recommended to that position by the Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives, and was also chaplain to Katherine of Aragon.<br>
<br>Fetherston was one of the few clerics in the convocation of the province of Canterbury who, in 1531, signed a protest against the king's assumption of the title of supreme head of the church. As part of his opposition to the royal divorce and the break with Rome he is said to have written a treatise <span class="italic">Contra divortium Henrici et Catherinae</span>, but no copy survives. He was committed to the Tower of London on 13 December 1534 to coerce him into taking the oath of supremacy; after persistent refusal he was attainted by act of parliament in January 1535 and deprived of his benefices. He seems to have remained in the Tower until 1540, when he was once again attainted for denying the king's supremacy. He was hanged and quartered at Smithfield on 30 July 1540, along with fellow Catholics Edward Powell and Thomas Abel, as well as Robert Barnes, Thomas Garrett, and William Jerome, as part of the king's symbolic, simultaneous executions of three papalists for treason and three protestants for heresy. Fetherston was beatified by the Roman Catholic church in 1886.<br>
