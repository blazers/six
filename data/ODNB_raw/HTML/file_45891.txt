<span class="headword">Crawshay,  Richard</span>  (1739&#150;1810), <span class="occ">ironmaster and merchant</span>, was born in Normanton, Yorkshire, the first child of William Crawshay (1713&#150;1766), a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth (1714&#150;1774), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nicholson. He had three sisters. According to family tradition a bitter quarrel with his father led to the sixteen-year-old Crawshay setting out for London. Once in the capital he apprenticed himself to a Thames Street ironware merchant named Bicklewith, selling, so legend has it, the pony which had carried him from Yorkshire to furnish a premium. Whatever the truth of this, Crawshay's career was certainly an exercise in self-improvement in the classic Smilesian mould. Indeed, he was the subject of an encomium in Samuel Smiles's <span class="italic">Lives of the Engineers</span> (1861&#150;2). The young man's resourcefulness and application were soon evident, for by 1763 Crawshay was in sole possession of Bicklewith's business, and as if to mark his independence, he married Mary Bourne (1745&#150;1811), the daughter of a London stonegrate maker, on 13 June 1763. They had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47475/', "William Crawshay (1764&#150;1834)")</script>, and three daughters, Anne, Elizabeth, and Charlotte.<br>
<br>During the 1760s and 1770s Crawshay traded as an iron merchant and a dealer in cast-iron wares from a variety of wharfs and warehouses, before settling at George Yard, Upper Thames Street, which was to be the London base of the Crawshay family firm until 1864. By the 1780s Crawshay was probably London's leading iron merchant. However, his pre-eminence in the capital was not enough. Although he had made much of his fortune by importing iron from the Baltic, he was irresistibly attracted by the idea of becoming an ironmaster in his own right, in Britain. His opportunity came in 1786 with the death of Anthony Bacon, master of the Cyfarthfa ironworks at Merthyr Tudful, with whom Crawshay had been in partnership as a supplier of guns to the Board of Ordnance during the American War of Independence. The guns had been cast at Cyfarthfa and Crawshay must have been well aware of the potential of the iron industry in mineral-rich south Wales. Accordingly, he leased Cyfarthfa from Bacon's estate and devoted an increasing amount of his time to the development of the works. He had, he told a visitor there, &#145;bent his whole mind upon being a perfect iron-master&#146;  (Manners, 69).<br>
<br>By 1793 Crawshay claimed to have laid out &pound;50,000 on new plant at Cyfarthfa. He did so with effect. A survey of pig iron production in 1796 identified Cyfarthfa as by far the largest ironworks in Britain, casting 7204 tons when average output per works was a mere 1562 tons. The expansion of smelting was more than matched by a massive growth in forge capacity at Cyfarthfa. Indeed, it was in the field of iron refining that Crawshay made his most signal contribution to the British iron trade. He was the sponsor of the &#145;iron puddling&#146; technique of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6359/', "Henry Cort")</script>, which was pioneered as a commercially viable process at his works in the late 1780s and which revolutionized the production of malleable bar iron in Britain. It was small wonder that Cyfarthfa attracted industrialists and technologists from across Europe, anxious to view what was referred to locally as the domain of &#145;Moloch the Iron King&#146;. For his part, Crawshay relished the attention. His ambition was overweening: &#145;I must do more than any other Man or my Emulation is not gratify'd&#146;  (Gwent RO, D2.162, fol. 233, R. Crawshay to T. Erskine, 3 Nov 1797).<br>
<br>Crawshay's imperiousness did little to endear him to his fellow ironmasters at Merthyr. Their relations were famously sour. He was, an admirer conceded, &#145;overbearing in his manners &amp; more unfortunately at variance &hellip; with several others who are embarked in the same class of trade&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/61, fol. 529, G. Hardinge to the duke of Portland, 11 April 1801). The &#145;Tyrant&#146;, as Crawshay was dubbed by one of his neighbours, could brook no local opposition  (NL Wales, Maybery 2466, R. Hill to J. Powell, 5 Aug 1793). Yet Crawshay was also alert to the sense of corporate fraternity that was so prominent a feature of the eighteenth-century iron trade. His commissioning of a set of portraits of the chief iron founders in the kingdom in 1796 was one expression of this amity. He was indefatigable in protecting the interests of the iron trade, putting to good use the many political contacts he had acquired during his years among the mercantile &eacute;lite of the City of London, and he played a notable part in the campaign to avert the threatened taxation of iron in 1797.<br>
<br>Crawshay's interests were not exclusively in iron. He was a tireless advocate of agricultural improvement and canvassed schemes of general enclosure during the 1790s. He took a leading role in the development of canal and road communications in south Wales. He was also a devout churchman. His circle included high-churchmen such as William Stevens, an erstwhile partner at Cyfarthfa, as well as evangelicals from the Clapham Sect. His was a highly conservative Anglicanism, which had him at odds with the &#145;fanatick Sectarys&#146; of Merthyr with their radical sympathies.<br>
<br>Crawshay died on 27 June 1810. He was buried at Llandaff Cathedral, attended by vast crowds from Merthyr. His estate was valued at &pound;1.5 million. His ironworks were divided between his son, William, his son-in-law Benjamin Hall (1778&#150;1817), and his nephew Joseph Bailey (1783&#150;1858). To the end, Crawshay was without social pretension. Unlike some of his ironmaster neighbours, he did not aspire to social grandeur. He adopted a simple family motto: &#145;Perseverance&#146;.<br>
