<span class="headword">Huxtable,  (William) John Fairchild</span>  (1912&#150;1990), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and college head</span>, was born on 25 July 1912 at Ladysmith Villa, Plumpton Green, near Lewes, Sussex, where his father, Percy John Fairchild Huxtable (1883&#150;1922), lately of West Moors Congregational Church, Devon, was minister. His mother, Florence Watts (1885&#150;1968), who had been apprenticed in the bakery and confectionery trade, married Percy in the Baptist church, Barnstaple, in March 1911. Following a pastorate at Blenheim Road Mission, Crouch End (1913&#150;19), and service with the YMCA (1919&#150;21), the family moved to Leghorn, Italy, where Percy had taken a post with the British and Foreign Sailors' Society, and where, within two months of arriving, he died on 13 July. His widow, with John and his sister Kathleen, returned to Devon and associated themselves with the Congregational church in Barnstaple, whose minister, George Herbert King Chick (1892&#150;1973), greatly influenced the young Huxtable.<br>
<br>A pupil at Barnstaple grammar school until 1930, from there John went to Western College, Bristol, under the distinguished scholar Robert Sleightholme Franks, where he graduated BA (Bristol) in English and philosophy, and then began his theological studies. The latter were completed during two years at Mansfield College, Oxford (1935&#150;7), where his teachers included Nathaniel Micklem, H. Wheeler Robinson, T. W. Manson, and A. M. Hunter. Deeply appreciative of the catholic roots of the faith, and valuing Congregationalism's reformed heritage, he joined the Church Order Group, whose leaders included Micklem, John Whale, and Bernard, Lord Manning.<br>
<br>On 2 September 1937 Huxtable was ordained at Newton Abbot Congregational Church, Micklem delivering the charge to the minister, and Chick that to the church. Here he met Joan Lorimer Snow (<i>b</i>. 1912), whom he married on 6 September 1939. They had a son, Peter, and two daughters, Janet and Felicity. With the approach of war Huxtable came to review the pacifism which had led to his becoming a member of the Peace Pledge Union, and found that &#145;With much hesitation I had become and remain a very reluctant non-pacifist&#146;  (Huxtable, 23).<br>
<br>In September 1942 Huxtable was inducted to the pastorate at Palmers Green, London, a large suburban church which gave him many families to care for, a pulpit of some significance, and opportunities to serve the denomination, but fewer civic duties than he had enjoyed in Barnstaple. In 1948 he was a delegate to the first assembly of the World Council of Churches, and from 1948 to 1974 he served on the translation committee of the <span class="italic">New English Bible</span>.<br>
<br>After twelve happy years at Palmers Green, Huxtable was called to the principalship of New College, London, in succession to Sydney Cave (1883&#150;1953). Here Congregational ministers were trained within the orbit of London University, and here Huxtable's colleagues included the church historian Geoffrey F. Nuttall, whom he had known at Mansfield College, but not intimately. The two came to have a high regard for one another, notwithstanding their differing emphases on matters historical, liturgical, and ecumenical.<br>
<br>Under the leadership of Howard Stanley, its general secretary, the Congregational Union of England and Wales (CUEW) inaugurated ten commissions to review the denomination's life and witness. Huxtable chaired that on the nature of the church&#151;a &#145;hot potato&#146;, given the reluctance of some to conceive of a denomination as a churchly body, and the fears of some conservative evangelicals that the authority of scripture was in danger of being compromised. In the midst of these excitements Huxtable chaired the CUEW (1962&#150;3). In 1964 he left New College to follow Stanley as general secretary of the CUEW, and two years later he became the first minister-secretary of the newly covenanted Congregational church in England and Wales. Meanwhile his ecumenical activities had been increasing. He was a vice-president of the British Council of Churches, and served the International Congregational Council and, after that body's union in 1970 with the World Presbyterian Alliance, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. He also served on the central committee of the World Council of Churches, and was intimately involved in conversations between the Congregationalists and the Presbyterian Church of England. The last bore fruit in the union in 1972 of the latter church with the majority of English and English-speaking Welsh Congregationalists to form the United Reformed church, of whose general assembly Huxtable became the first moderator. With his Presbyterian opposite number, Arthur Macarthur, he became joint secretary of the new church. In the same year he became the first free church minister to be honoured by the then archbishop of Canterbury (A. M. Ramsay) with the Lambeth DD, a similar honour being bestowed a few months later by Aberdeen University. He was moderator of the Free Church Federal Council in 1976&#150;7.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1974 Huxtable had become the executive officer of the Churches' Unity Commission. He worked tirelessly for a cause dear to his heart, and convened the first meeting of the Churches' Council for Covenanting, which met on 24 November 1978. He then retired to Devon, fearful that the covenanting scheme would founder, as it did.<br>
<br>Huxtable was a faithful minister, a gifted expository preacher, a lover of liturgical decency and order, and a trusted ecumenist. His publications reflect these interests. Thus his first book, <span class="italic">The Ministry</span> (1943), which he later regarded as his &#145;young man's book&#146;, was nevertheless a manifesto expressive of convictions concerning the ministry of Word, sacrament, and pastoral care in the context of the gathered church which remained with him throughout his life; and these were reinforced by his study of John Owen, whose <span class="italic">The True Nature of a Gospel Church</span> (1689) he abridged and edited (1949). He shared with John Marsh, E. R. Micklem, and J. M. Todd in the preparation of <span class="italic">A Book of Public Worship</span> (1949), a reformed yet catholic volume in which the relation of Word with sacrament was clearly displayed; and his published sets of broadcast talks testify to his ability to communicate with a wide audience. In 1962, expressing his indebtedness to P. T. Forsyth and John Oman (though perhaps borrowing his title from the evangelist Billy Graham's constantly reiterated phrase), he published <span class="italic">The Bible Says</span>. He here adjusted himself to traditional Roman Catholic and protestant attitudes to the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and, over against fundamentalism and the views of J. I. Packer, he presented his view of the authority of scripture and the place of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the worship and life of the church. There followed <span class="italic">The Preacher's Integrity</span> (1966) and two books of ecumenical interest: <span class="italic">Christian Unity, some of the Issues</span> (1966) and <span class="italic">A New Hope for Christian Unity</span> (1977). In the wake of the failure of the ten propositions for covenanting&#151;itself a successor to the failed Anglican&#150;Methodist unity proposals&#151;Huxtable came to the rueful conclusion that because of its (then) attitude towards the ordination of women and its sectarianism concerning non-episcopal ordinations the Church of England was destined to be &#145;the bridge Church over which no traffic ever flows&#146;  (Huxtable, 71). Huxtable died on 16 November 1990 at Torbay Hospital, Torquay, and was cremated on 23 November at Torquay.<br>
