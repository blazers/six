<span class="headword">Hatton,  Brian</span>  (1887&#150;1916), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at Carlton Villas, Whitecross Road, Hereford, on 12 August 1887, the only son and eldest child of Alfred Hatton (1856&#150;1933) and his wife Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keay (1864&#150;1909). He had two younger sisters, Ailsa Marr (1893&#150;1949) and Marjorie (1895&#150;1981). His father, Alfred Hatton, like his grandfather Charles Hatton and his grandfather's three brothers, were in the leather trade, where they were known for the manufacture of the &#145;Wye Boot&#146;. His mother was the eldest of the six daughters of Robert Keay, a Hereford JP. In 1895 the family moved from Whitecross Road to Mount Craig, Broomy Hill, Breinton, pleasant country on the left bank of the Wye west of Hereford.<br>
<br>Hatton showed remarkable artistic talent from infancy. He sketched from his earliest years, producing a charming and astonishing study of birds in his pram aged two. When at home he roamed the fields along the Wye at Warham, recording the landscape, country people, and horses&#151;his passion&#151;which he rode and drew throughout his life. He was asthmatic with a lifelong stammer, and was prone to epilepsy-like fainting fits. The family doctor recommended sea air and, aged ten, he was sent to live with the doctor's relatives, at Winchester House, Swansea.<br>
<br>Hatton began winning competitions in 1895, aged eight, with the Royal Drawing Society (RDS) bronze medal, awarded by G. F. Watts, and the Art for Schools Association medal. In April 1898 he was awarded the RDS gold star by Princess Louise. She and her equerry, Colonel Arthur Collins, became admirers of Hatton's work, begging drawings from him and inviting him and his mother to call at Kensington Palace. Watts thought he would develop into the greatest artist of his generation and invited him and his mother to stay at his Surrey home, Limnerslease. Mary Watts especially was a constant support.<br>
<br>From 1899 to 1902 Hatton attended Swansea grammar school where extra time was allowed him for art practice, and from where he sent home a stream of illustrated letters. He spent two terms in residence at Trinity College, Oxford, from 1905 to 1906, making a lasting friend of his tutor R. W. Raper, the college bursar. Raper found him patrons including Queen Victoria's granddaughter Princess Alice (Princess Alexander of Teck), who invited him to Windsor to draw her children. He then spent a year at Hospitalfield Art School, Arbroath, where he was funded by his uncle Charles Marr. He holidayed in St Ives and Newlyn, Cornwall, and went with his uncle to Amsterdam and The Hague, meeting artists.<br>
<br>On returning to Herefordshire, Hatton set up a studio in the coach house at Mount Craig and worked on his oil portraits, a likely source of income. He painted his family and local dignitaries such as Bishop Percival (1910; Hereford Museum and Art Gallery), including animals if possible, as in the portrait of Sir Reginald Rankin with his hunter Dervish (1910; priv. coll.) and Charles Fitzwilliams with a hound (1910; priv. coll.). His finest painting of this time is the self-portrait of 1908 (Hereford Museum and Art Gallery). This year he joined the Flinders Petrie archaeological expedition to sketch in Egypt. In 1910 he attended the Acad&eacute;mie Julien in Paris for life class practice and had a painting hung in the Paris Salon.<br>
<br>Hatton's ambition took him to London where he shared rooms with his cousin, Geoffrey Vevers, at 33 Nevern Square, South Kensington. He set up a studio with his Oxford friend Gerald Siordet and had <span class="italic">Night Piece to Julia</span> (Hereford Museum and Art Gallery) accepted at the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1914. Work submitted to the Royal Institute of Oil Painters was praised and he was elected a member. He was commissioned to illustrate John Masefield's <span class="italic">The Everlasting Mercy</span>, while staying with relatives in Ledbury for local colour. He went again to Paris and on the eve of war his uncle Charles took him on holiday to Belgium.<br>
<br>Despite these contacts with the continent there are few signs in Hatton's practice of current artistic developments. Elderly patrons like Mary Watts and Briton Riviere warned him to avoid post-impressionism. One of his last paintings, <span class="italic">Sunday Morning in the Park</span> (1914; Hereford Museum and Art Gallery), shows impressionist traits, but further development in that direction was cut short by the First World War.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1914 Hatton enlisted with the Worcester yeomanry as a trooper. Shortly afterwards, on 5 November 1914, at Newbury, Berkshire, he married his Hereford sweetheart Lydia May Bidmead (<i>b</i>. 1888), a teacher of dancing. She gave birth to their daughter, Mary Amelia, in September 1915 just before Hatton was posted to Egypt. He had some words of Arabic from his previous trip to Egypt and trained as a signaller. He was commissioned, and held the rank of second lieutenant when he was killed in action at Oghratina on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1916, while providing a guard for a well-digging detachment. They were attacked by a superior force of Turks who chanced to be passing, were surrounded, and were cut down. Hatton, the best rider in the troop, volunteered to go for reinforcements, but was shot and later buried where he had fallen. A friend traced his grave and his remains were eventually moved to Kantara war memorial cemetery in Egypt.<br>
<br>Hatton's widow and baby lived for a while at Mount Craig, Breinton, with Hatton's father and sisters. In 1930 she married another Hereford man, Angus Wilson. Hatton's daughter, Mary, became a notable ballet dancer, dancing with the Ballets Russes de Paris. On a trip to America she married the editor of an Illinois newspaper, Cecil Shaler, and settled there, her mother later joining them.<br>
<br>In his brief life as an artist Hatton produced over 1000 works: drawings, watercolours, oils, prints, and some sculpture. His paintings of horses and country people especially are of a high standard from a surprisingly early age, and he showed insightful skill as an illustrator. There were posthumous London exhibitions at Walker's Galleries in 1926, and Leighton House in 1955. He sold a few portraits but the bulk of his work was presented to Hereford Museum by his widow, who gave his letters to Hereford Record Office. His sister Marjorie Hatton devoted her life to his memory. She set up the Brian Hatton Trust which funded the creation of the Brian Hatton Gallery, an extension of Churchill House costume museum in Hereford. His work now occupies a bay at Hereford Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
