<span class="headword">Manningham, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1685, <em>d.</em> 1759), <span class="occ">man-midwife</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17983/', "Thomas Manningham (d. 1722)")</script>, later bishop of Chichester, and his wife, Elizabeth (1656/7&#150;1714), was baptized at East Tisted, Hampshire, on 2 March 1685. Like his elder brother he was intended for the church; however, having been admitted as a fellow-commoner to Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 27 September 1717, he proceeded LLB in the same year, before gaining the MD, by mandate, in 1725. Nothing is known of his further education in medicine.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1719 Manningham was elected FRS and on 30 September he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians; on 18 February 1722 he was knighted by George I. He obviously made rapid progress in his career, and was looked on as a leading man-midwife of his day. He was commanded by the king to investigate the case of Mary Toft of Godalming, who claimed to have given birth to several rabbits. Through contacts at court John Howard, the local Surrey man-midwife, had Mary Toft transferred to Lacy's bagnio in London, there to be exhibited. However, she finally confessed to her fraud, largely because a porter at Lacy's was discovered with a rabbit in his pocket. Manningham, along with others, seems to have been duped by Toft, and attempted to exculpate himself by publishing, in 1726, <span class="italic">An exact diary of what was observ'd during a close attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended rabbet-breeder of Godalming in Surrey, from Monday, Nov. 28, to Dec. 7, following, together with an account of her confession of the fraud</span>.<br>
<br>Manningham taught midwifery, for a course fee of 20 guineas, using, as did many of his contemporaries, some kind of model of a pelvis and uterus. His main published work, of 1739 and 1740, was <span class="italic">Artis obstetricariae compendium</span>, which was translated into English in 1744; the original version was written in inelegant and incorrect Latin. It was expanded, as <span class="italic">Aphorisma medica</span>, in 1756. Manningham followed the teachings of the Dutchman Hendrik van Deventer (1651&#150;1724) in regard to conservative midwifery and in his descriptions of the shapes of the bony pelvis and the obliquity of the uterus, with their effects on labour. When there was disproportion between the size of the foetal head and the pelvis Manningham advocated internal version, in which, with a hand in the uterus, the foetus is turned so that either the head or the breech is made to present. If the breech then the baby may be born by traction on the feet and legs. Manningham may have favoured turning to the head presentation when others mainly used podalic version. He would not, in difficult labours, resort to the recently introduced obstetric forceps, first depicted by Edmund Chapman in 1735 and afterwards employed by many other man-midwives of the time. Manningham claimed that caesarean section should be performed only after death of the mother, a generally held view at the time. Correctly, he taught that the placenta is usually inserted in the fundus of the uterus. He knew of convulsions in pregnancy (eclampsia) and treated those afflicted with fits by venesection, then a commonplace remedy. He had seen a fallopian tube, at post-mortem, closed by infection; this tended to be common after manual removal of the placenta, making it clear, in Manningham's view, how dangerous it was to employ unskilled individuals in midwifery. He thought that children born seven months into the term of a pregnancy rarely survive whereas those born at eight months do, if well nursed. Manningham's major contribution to midwifery was that of establishing, in 1739, for the first time in this country, lying-in beds for mothers; these were in a house next to his own, in Jermyn Street, not in the local parochial infirmary, as was once believed. The idea of lying-in beds was current among some of Manningham's contemporaries in London but he was the first to put it into practice; one of his objectives was to teach midwives. His <span class="italic">Abstract of Midwifery for Use in the Lying-in Infirmary</span> appeared in 1744; the institution closed a little later. The third edition of his treatise, <span class="italic">The Symptoms, Nature, Causes and Cure of the Febricula or Little Fever</span>, came out in 1755 but was of little significance; others of his works were on fevers and plague.<br>
<br>Evidence has been adduced that Manningham was politically a whig, with court connections, and that whig man-midwives were conservative in their practices whereas those who used forceps were in the tory tradition. The significance of this is hard to evaluate but suggests that there were separate coteries of man-midwives with differing ideas on the practice of midwifery allied with political affiliations. Thomas Denman, an eminent man-midwife, commented that Manningham was &#145;successful in practice and very humane in the exercise of his art&#146;.<br>
<br>Manningham lived in Chancery Lane, London, then successively in Haymarket and in Woodstock Street before finally settling in Jermyn Street in 1745, where he remained until his death there on 11 March 1759. His second son, Thomas, graduated MD at St Andrews University on 24 May 1765 and became LRCP on 25 June of the same year. He lived in his father's house in Jermyn Street until 1780, when he went to Bath, where he died on 3 February 1794.<br>
