<span class="headword">G&uuml;tzlaff,  Karl Friedrich August</span> <span class="st"> [Charles Gutzlaff]</span>  (1803&#150;1851), <span class="occ">missionary and civil servant</span>, son of Johann Jakob G&uuml;tzlaff (1767&#150;1825), a tailor, and Maria Elisabeth G&uuml;tzlaff, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Behneken (1767&#150;1807), was born in Pyritz, province of Pomerania, Prussia, on 8 July 1803. Having attended Pyritz municipal school from 1811 to 1816, he was apprenticed to a brazier in Stettin. However, finding foreign evangelistic work more attractive, he entered J&auml;nicke's Missionary School in Berlin in 1821. After further training in Rotterdam, he was ordained in 1826 and sent to the Dutch East Indies as an agent of the Netherlands Missionary Society. After a brief spell in Batavia with William Henry Medhurst, G&uuml;tzlaff set out on 8 April 1827 to convert the Chinese settlers in the Riau archipelago. A year later he embarked on independent missionary work among the Chinese of Bangkok, Siam. On 26 November 1829, during a visit to Malacca, G&uuml;tzlaff married Maria Newell (<i>c</i>.1794&#150;1831) of the London Missionary Society.<br>
<br>Being a restless spirit with seemingly boundless energy, G&uuml;tzlaff next turned up on the China coast. As a result of his trip to Tientsin (Tianjin) in a Chinese junk in 1831, British traders began to make use of his extraordinary linguistic talents in their efforts to find new markets. Although he was later criticized for having associated with opium smugglers to propagate Christianity, G&uuml;tzlaff regarded these trips as unique opportunities to preach and distribute Christian literature beyond the confines of Canton (Guangzhou). Moreover, his <span class="italic">Journal of Three Voyages Along the Coast of China in 1831, 1832, 1833</span> (1834) generated considerable interest in China in Western political, commercial, and religious circles, as did his <span class="italic">Sketch of Chinese history, ancient and modern, comprising a retrospect of the foreign intercourse and trade with China</span> (1834) and the more controversial <span class="italic">China opened, or, A display of the topography, history, customs, manners, etc. of the Chinese empire</span> (1838). All three were written in English. At the same time, G&uuml;tzlaff sought to create greater awareness among the Chinese of Western achievements through religious and secular publications such as his serial <span class="italic">Dong-Xi yang kao meiyue tongji zhuan</span> (the &#145;East-West monthly magazine&#146;), which between 1833 and 1839 contained contributions on Western science, geography, government, and history. During these busy and adventurous years, he still found time on 6 May 1834 to marry the independent missionary Mary Wanstall (1799&#150;1849) at Malacca.<br>
<br>In 1835 G&uuml;tzlaff entered British government service as an assistant interpreter and Chinese secretary to the chief superintendent of trade in China. During the First Opium War (1839&#150;42) he was appointed civil administrator at Tinghai (Dinghai; July 1840 &#150; February 1841) at the time of the first British occupation of Chushan Island, and subsequently at Ningpo (Ningbo; October 1841 &#150; May 1842). During the intervening military campaigns he was interpreter to the commander of the British expeditionary force and was present as indispensable interpreter&#150;negotiator at the conclusion of the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) on 29 August 1842. He spent a further eleven months (September 1842 &#150; August 1843) as civil magistrate on Chushan Island during the second British occupation. Having failed to secure a consulship on account of his alien status, G&uuml;tzlaff succeeded John Robert Morrison as first Chinese secretary to her majesty's government in Hong Kong in 1843.<br>
<br>Although a civil servant, G&uuml;tzlaff did not neglect his missionary work. During the First Opium War he had come to realize that &#145;China can be evangelised only by the Chinese&#146;. To this end, in 1844 he formed the controversial Chinese Union of indigenous colporteurs and evangelists to carry the gospel to all parts of the Chinese empire. Foreign missionaries, living in Chinese style, were to provide only initial training and guidance.<br>
<br>In September 1849 G&uuml;tzlaff left for Europe to garner support for the Chinese Union. Yet while he was enthusiastically welcomed in several European countries, the fraudulent activities of his unscrupulous Chinese associates were exposed by less credulous Hong Kong missionaries. When G&uuml;tzlaff returned to the colony in early 1851 his Chinese Union was on the point of collapse. Disappointed and worn out by overexertion, he died from dropsy on 9 August 1851 and was buried in Happy Valley cemetery, Hong Kong, leaving a widow, Dorothy Gabriel (1821&#150;1888), whom he had married in Bristol on 17 September 1850.<br>
<br>History has not been kind to Karl G&uuml;tzlaff. One scholar calls him &#145;a cross between parson and pirate, charlatan and genius, philanthropist and crook&#146;  (A. Waley, <span class="italic">The Opium War through Chinese Eyes</span>, 1958, 233). He was a missionary enthusiast with progressive ideas, yet also a poor judge of men and lacking in organizational skills. Still, his career of &#145;missionary-diplomat&#146; has to be seen in its proper historical context. At a time when China remained a closed country, his role as cultural mediator between East and West was not without merit. Moreover, G&uuml;tzlaff's vital government service during and after the First Opium War was fully recognized by the British authorities.<br>
