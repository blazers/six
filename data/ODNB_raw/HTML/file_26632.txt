<span class="headword">Strang,  John</span>  (1583/4&#150;1654), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and university principal</span>, was born at Irvine, Ayrshire, the son of William Strang (1545/6&#150;1588), the minister there, and his wife, Agnes, sister of Alexander Borthwick of Nether Lenagher, Edinburghshire. Upon his father's death his mother married Robert Wilkie (<i>d</i>. 1601), minister of Kilmarnock, and Strang was educated at the local grammar school. About 1596 Strang was sent to the University of St Andrews, under the guidance of principal Wilkie, a relation of his stepfather. He graduated MA in 1600. Subsequently he became a regent of St Leonard's College, St Andrews. Following ordination, he was admitted as minister of Erroll, in the presbytery of Perth, on 10 April 1614, on the recommendation of the professors at St Andrews and of Arthur Henderson, then minister of Leuchars, one of his tasks being to counter the Catholicism of Francis Hay, ninth earl of Erroll. On 29 July 1616 he received a DD from St Andrews. In 1617 he took part in the disputations before James VI during the king's visit to Scotland. In the Perth assembly of 1618 he voted against the five articles, but this did not prevent his nomination in 1619 to the high commission appointed to ensure their implementation. However, Strang did not attend the commission's meetings. In 1620 he refused the offer of a church in Edinburgh. While at Erroll, Strang married Janet (1589?&#150;1627), daughter of William Hay of Barra and widow of James Smyth, minister of Erroll; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Before his death, James VI offered Strang the post of principal of Glasgow University and professor of divinity. Strang wished to secure the support of the former principal, Robert Boyd, who was intriguing to get his place back, but even without that he accepted and was admitted on 21 February 1626. The new position suited him better than the ministry, for he was reputed to be a poor preacher. In Glasgow, possibly on 9 September 1627, he married Agnes Fleming. They had one son (who died in 1651, aged twenty-two) and two daughters. At Glasgow, Strang became a promoter of new buildings, including the inner court of the college in the High Street.<br>
<br>In July 1637 Strang was a notable opponent of Charles I's liturgical innovations. Robert Baillie, who in 1656 married Strang's daughter Helen (<i>d</i>. 1679), later wrote that Strang's &#145;first concurrence did a great deal of good to further that universal refusal of the [Prayer] Book which followed&#146;  (Baillie, 1.28&#150;9). However, Strang was reluctant to subscribe the covenant in February 1638 without qualifying it<blockquote>so far as that confession was not prejudicial to the king's authority, the office of episcopal government itself, and that power which is given bishops by lawful assemblies and parliaments, and in so far as we are bound to withstand all innovations in the worship of God, contrary to his written word, and the Confession of Faith of the Church of Scotland. (ibid., 1.66&#150;9)</blockquote>In the event, in July 1638 Archibald Johnston of Wariston persuaded Strang to take the covenant as it stood.<br>
<br>When Charles I withdrew the liturgy and canons, Strang supported the king's commissioner, James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton, even sending him arguments opposing Johnston's protestation of 22 September 1638. In it he argued that the king's concessions were sufficient and that the king's covenant should be signed, although his desire for anonymity prevented its publication. Strang's views were valued, as he was perceived by Walter Balcangell as the &#145;learnedest Covenanter in Scotland&#146;  (Baillie, 1.476), and he supported peace in the church rather than theological purity. At the Glasgow assembly in November 1638 Strang was persuaded to disown his own protestation, against lay elders sitting in the assembly or voting in presbyteries, much to Hamilton's chagrin. However, when Hamilton departed from the assembly, so did Strang, and he then faced demands that he be summoned back. These were defeated and Strang continued to represent the university at general assemblies.<br>
<br>Strang's second wife died in January 1641 and he married Ann Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1649) in Glasgow, possibly on 9 December 1641. In 1643 Baillie recounted Strang's busy lifestyle, which included his university work and &#145;a charge beside would kill an ox&#146;  (Baillie, 2.71). The discovery after the battle of Naseby of Strang's correspondence with Archbishop William Laud and his unpublished treatise of 1638 placed him on the defensive. In 1646 the general assembly appointed commissioners to examine his views, particularly the charge that he inclined to the teachings of the Dutch theologian Moise Amyraut. The commissioners found him orthodox after Strang had signed a paper assenting to the decisions of the Synod of Dort. This was duly reported back to the general assembly in August 1647. Almost at the same date, Baillie was describing him as &#145;among the best scholars of the Reformed Church&#146;  (ibid., 3.5&#150;6).<br>
<br>Strang's third wife died in June 1649. He was eventually forced to retire from Glasgow, after a visitation from the estates of the kingdom, and the general assembly accepted his supplication to retire on 19 April 1650. He was awarded a pension of 1000 merks, together with a testimonial of his orthodoxy, and lived in retirement in the college until 1653. He died while on a visit to Edinburgh on 20 June 1654, aged seventy, and was buried on 22 June at Greyfriars. He was survived by four daughters. Two of his works appeared posthumously, <span class="italic">De voluntate et actionibus Dei circa peccatum</span> (Amsterdam, 1657) and <span class="italic">De interpretatione et perfectione scripturae, una cum opusculis de sabbato</span> (Rotterdam, 1663), treating respectively sin and the sabbath.<br>
