<span class="headword">Cobban,  Alfred Bert Carter</span>  (1901&#150;1968), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 24 May 1901 at 40 Oakley Crescent, Chelsea, London, the only son of Robert Cobban, a furniture salesman employed by the Army and Navy Stores, and his wife, Edith Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carter. A quiet, studious boy, he won scholarships to Latymer Upper School, London, and then to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (1919). After gaining a first in both parts of the modern history tripos (1922) he became a graduate student and research fellow there until 1926, when, having completed his doctorate, he took up a lectureship in history at King's College, Newcastle. He married on 23 July 1929 (Kathleen) Muriel (1906&#150;1988/9), daughter of James Hartshorn, a schoolmaster. She was a woman of immense energy and geniality who ran all aspects of his life outside the academic allowing him to give a lifelong commitment to teaching and writing. They had two daughters: Ann (1930) and Lucinda (1939).<br>
<br>In 1937 Cobban became reader in modern French history at University College, London. He declined the offer of tenured professorship at the University of Chicago in 1947 and in 1953 was given the title professor of French history in the University of London.<br>
<br>Cobban was a prolific writer, with thirteen books and some fifty articles to his name. While a schoolboy he kept a remarkable commonplace book showing him from the age of sixteen to have devoured up to twenty books a month in three languages, English, French, and Latin. Political ideas (particularly the Enlightenment and its critics) and French history, especially the Revolution, preoccupied him throughout his academic career. He was opposed to two approaches: the first divorced ideas from their context and treated them as if they had a simple linear progression and evolved in ethereal space; the second was thought systems which sought to squeeze the historical record into an ideological corset. For this reason he was fundamentally at odds with Marxist historiography which dominated Revolutionary studies in France until the late 1970s, while retaining an enormous respect for Georges Lefebvre, who held the Sorbonne chair.<br>
<br>Cobban's first work, <span class="italic">Edmund Burke and the Revolt Against the Eighteenth Century</span> (1926) was a study of the arguments of the conservative tradition in British eighteenth-century politics and the events in France to which these arguments referred. In contrast <span class="italic">Rousseau and the Modern State</span> (1934) explores the development of ideas promoting state power. The approaching war prompted one of his most incisive analyses in <span class="italic">Dictatorship: its History and Theory</span> (1939). He held that the Enlightenment, in its remorseless opposition to despotism, and its belief in man's right to earthly fulfilment, represented a high-water mark in the history of political ideas, a view which found its fullest expression in <span class="italic">In Search of Humanity: the Role of the Enlightenment in Modern History</span> (1960), based on a series of lectures initially given in the United States, where his work was very highly valued.<br>
<br>Cobban did some archive-based work, for example, <span class="italic">Ambassadors and Secret Agents: the Diplomacy of the First Earl of Malmesbury at The Hague</span> (1954) on Anglo-French relations between 1784 and 1788. However, his outstanding talent lay in drawing upon the evidence contained in neglected volumes of printed documents and monographs in order to question received interpretation and offer a challenging alternative. His inaugural lecture at London, <span class="italic">The Myth of the French Revolution</span> (1954), which he subsequently enlarged into the Wiles lectures (1962) to form <span class="italic">The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution</span> (1964), disputed a Marxist interpretation of the Revolution&#151;which represented it as the triumph of bourgeois capitalism over feudalism. Instead he demonstrated that the politically active bourgeois of 1789 were economically hard-pressed groups of professionals and office holders who were reluctantly pushed into the abolition of vestigial seigneurial dues by an insurgent peasantry and that the &#145;Revolution&#146; left the distribution of propertied wealth and power largely unchanged. This work, now recognized as a historiographical landmark, initially generated much dissent in France but by the 1980s his interpretation was accepted. Indeed, his analysis of the vocabulary of social history anticipated some of the debates on discourse of the bicentennial. Cobban was the last major twentieth-century historian to posit a social rather than an &#145;ideas&#146; interpretation of the Revolution.<br>
<br>Cobban's three-volume <span class="italic">History of Modern France</span> (1957&#150;65), a lucid and compelling narrative, introduced more than three generations of Britons to French history. The communication of ideas to as broad an audience as possible, young and old, inside and outside the academy, and the importance of fostering balanced judgement based on evidence were for him the essence of his job, and made him a deeply committed editor of <span class="italic">History</span> (1956&#150;67), who transformed the appeal of the journal. He was a brilliant teacher of undergraduates, generating confidence in the shy and diffident, and he attracted large numbers of graduate students from both sides of the Atlantic. He had a considerable impact upon the teaching of history in Canada and the USA as well as in Britain. A commemorative volume by his students (<span class="italic">French Government and Society, 1500&#150;1850</span>, 1973) attests to the extent of his influence. His seminar at the Institute of Historical Research was rigorous, lively, and very democratic. He actually liked his students to prove him wrong, as this proved their development. Even when terminally ill he discussed ideas with them from his sickbed. His intellectual rigour endured to the end. He died in London, slowly and bravely, on 1 April 1968 at a Kensington nursing home which became, in the last weeks of his life, a place of pilgrimage for colleagues, former students, and international scholars.<br>
