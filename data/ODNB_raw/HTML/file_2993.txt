<span class="headword">Bourchier,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1411&#150;1486), <span class="occ">cardinal and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was probably the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50242/', "William Bourchier, count of Eu (c.1374&#150;1420)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54430/', "Anne of Woodstock")</script>, daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27197/', "Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester")</script>, and granddaughter of Edward III. His mother's second marriage, to Edmund Stafford, fifth earl of Stafford, created links that would be important for the children of her third marriage. Like his brothers (the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2987/', "Henry Bourchier")</script>, who was created earl of Essex by Edward IV, and William and John, who were to be summoned to parliament respectively as lords Fitzwarine and Berners), Thomas owed much to his mother's royal and aristocratic connections. So, too, did their sister, Eleanor, who married John (VI) Mowbray, third duke of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1461).<h2>
<a name="Earlypromotions"></a>Early promotions</h2>At some point after his father's death Thomas Bourchier was sent to Oxford, and despite his youth he rapidly gained preferment in the church. By April 1427 he was master of the hospital of St Mary Magdalene at Paull in Yorkshire; on 1 December following, the council of regency offered him the deanery of St Martin's-le-Grand, London; and prebends in five different cathedrals fell to him within the next six years. He entered holy orders on 24 September 1429, being ordained acolyte and subdeacon in the diocese of London. By his mother's presentation in 1432 he secured a canonry in the royal free chapel of St Mary in Hastings Castle, linked with the prebend of West Thurrock in Essex. When Thomas Polton, bishop of Worcester, died at Basel on 23 August 1433, the candidacy of Bourchier, who by then had graduated MA at Oxford, was promoted by his kinsman Cardinal Beaufort to fill the vacancy, even though he was much younger than the minimum age for consecration as a bishop required under the provisions of the Council of Constance. The process of his elevation to the see lasted over eighteen months and involved lengthy negotiations with the papal court, as Eugenius IV (<i>r</i>. 1431&#150;47) had already nominated Thomas Brouns, dean of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1445), as Polton's successor. Bourchier's election by the prior and chapter on 9 December was prompted by a letter of recommendation from the royal council, and the support of the Commons in parliament, who laid stress on his royal blood and his outstanding abilities. A letter of fulsome praise of his academic record was sent by Oxford University to the pope, to whose ruling Bourchier formally submitted on 27 December. Eventually, on 21 February 1435 Brouns was translated to Rochester and the pope cancelled his previous nomination to Worcester by an antedated bull in favour of Bourchier, whose nomination therefore bears the date 9 March 1434. When Bourchier was consecrated, on 14 March 1435, it was on the strength of a provision in which the pope declared that he had &#145;hitherto promoted no one of the like age to a cathedral church&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 1427&#150;1447, 213&#150;19). The temporalities of the see were restored to him on 15 April.<br>
<br>In the course of the negotiations, at some point before 20 March 1434, Bourchier had been made chancellor of his university, a position he held for three years. He conducted his business in Nevill's Inn, one of the buildings that occupied the site of what is now Corpus Christi College. On 25 October 1435 the bishopric of Ely fell vacant. The chapter agreed to postulate Bourchier, who sent messengers to Rome to procure <span class="roman">bulls</span> for his translation from Worcester, but despite the papal provision in this instance he lacked the support of the king's ministers, who had a number of other preferred candidates for the see, which ultimately went to Louis de Luxembourg, archbishop of Rouen, in 1437. It was not until the latter died in 1443 that Bourchier was nominated by the king and elected by the chapter. Having received a bull for his translation, dated 20 December 1443, he was confirmed and had the temporalities restored to him on 27 February 1444. His conduct as bishop was adversely criticized by the historian of the monastery of Ely, who asserted that Bourchier had never celebrated mass in his own cathedral except on the day of his installation. Although there is ample evidence for his attendance on Henry VI's council at Westminster and elsewhere, Bourchier's registers for Worcester and Ely nevertheless show that he was conscientious about residing in both dioceses. He spent considerably more time at Worcester than he did away from it, at any rate after July 1437, while as bishop of Ely he resided in his diocese at least once a year, usually in the summer. Perhaps it was the fact that he never seems to have stayed at Ely itself that was resented in that house.<br>
<br>Bourchier was increasingly employed as a conciliator in disputes between his peers, a role for which he was apparently qualified not only by profession but also by temperament, for he was evidently regarded with genuine feelings of trust. Sir John Fastolf (<i>d</i>. 1459), generally suspicious of the motives of his contemporaries, referred to him as &#145;one of the lords earthly that I most trust upon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 2.109). Bourchier intervened to defuse violent local disputes between lords, as part of a process of applying his energies to matters of high political moment. In the critical days of February 1452 he was among the lords most closely occupied in preventing civil war by reaching terms with the duke of York, and on other occasions he engaged in arduous and delicate diplomacy as an arbitrator, reaching complex landed settlements. He was named as a mediator in the quarrels between the dukes of York and Somerset, and between the duke of Exeter and Lord Cromwell.<h2>
<a name="ChancellorofEngland"></a>Chancellor of England</h2>Bourchier's stature increased in the winter of 1453&#150;4 after Henry VI was struck by an incapacitating mental illness, and at the beginning of the third session of parliament in February 1454 it was he who, in the king's name, charged the Commons to elect a new speaker. When Cardinal John Kemp, the archbishop of Canterbury and chancellor, died on 22 March, Bourchier joined the deputation of lords in parliament who rode to Windsor the next day to inform the king and seek his guidance, but Henry failed to respond. Accordingly, the Lords appointed York as protector, and on 30 March the council, in compliance with a petition from the Commons, recommended Bourchier's promotion to the see of Canterbury, &#145;for his great merits, virtues and great blood that he is of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings &hellip; of the Privy Council</span>, 6.168). On 6 April the temporalities of Canterbury were committed to two of his brothers, his half-brother the duke of Buckingham, and other well-wishers. He was translated from Ely on 21 June, and the temporalities were restored to him on 6 August. On 6 September William Paston wrote &#145;My lord of Canterbury hath received his cross, and I was with him in the king's chamber when he made his homage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 1.155&#150;6). He was enthroned on 24 January 1455, following the king's recovery. On 7 March he was appointed chancellor, in place of York's ally the earl of Salisbury, and received the seals at Greenwich. Meanwhile, he had helped pave the way for Somerset's release from the Tower of London, yet, remarkably, apparently also retained the confidence of York, despite the failure of his attempts to mediate between them, and his acceptance of office in Henry VI's revived court regime. It was to Bourchier as chancellor and archbishop that York and his allies wrote to declare their peaceable intentions in May 1455, claiming that they were marching south to do the king service and to vindicate their loyalty. Bourchier allegedly sent a special messenger to the king at Kilburn, but this man was not allowed to come into the royal presence, so the opportunity to prevent armed conflict was lost. Following the Yorkist victory at the battle of St Albans on 22 May Bourchier was retained as chancellor, and his brother Henry (York's brother-in-law) was made treasurer a week later. The archbishop made the opening speech to the assembled Lords and Commons on 9 July, and it was he who prorogued the parliament at the end of the month. In October, after news of the murder of Nicholas Radford and the breakdown of order in the west country &#145;was told to my Lord Chaunceler&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 2.127), the Lords in parliament reluctantly agreed to York's reappointment as protector, and on 17 November Bourchier announced the royal assent. He then survived both York's brief eminence and its peremptory conclusion. In the summer of 1456 he and his brother, the treasurer, attempted to carry on the business of government in London by holding a great council there, but the focus of power was shifting to the midlands, to the queen, Margaret of Anjou, and her supporters. A few months later both brothers were suddenly discharged from office, Thomas Bourchier being dismissed on 11 October. Their half-brother Buckingham, attending a great council at Coventry in October, was reported to have taken their dismissal &#145;right straungely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 2.165). Nevertheless, the archbishop continued his endeavours as a peacemaker, and the temporary reconciliation of the factions in the spring of 1458 is largely attributable to his efforts. He needed also to deal with conflict within the church. In the previous year he had cited Reginald Pecock, bishop of Chichester, to appear before him to answer charges of heresy. On receiving an adverse verdict from the commission to which Pecock's works had been committed for examination, he faced him with the alternative of abjuration or burning; when Pecock chose the former and resigned his see, he had him confined at Canterbury. At Bourchier's request the Augustinian friar John Bury wrote his <span class="italic">Gladius Salomonis</span> as a reply to Pecock's <span class="italic">Repressor</span>.<h2>
<a name="SupporterofYork"></a>Supporter of York</h2>Immediately following the flight of the Yorkists, after the confrontation at Ludford on 12 October 1459, Bourchier joined his brothers and Buckingham in taking oaths of allegiance to Henry VI at the Coventry parliament in November. It may have been the attainder of two of his nephews (Thomas and John, the sons of his brother Henry) in the same parliament, and his increasing impotence as the queen's party grew in strength, that made him more partisan. By the summer of 1460 the Yorkist earls were confident of his help. Before crossing the channel from Calais they forwarded to him copies of their manifesto, and he met them at Sandwich and rode with his cross borne before them to London, which admitted them on 2 July. Next day he opened a session of a convocation at St Paul's to which the earls recited their grievances. It was resolved that he and five of his suffragans should accompany the Yorkist army to Northampton to use their diplomatic skills to obtain a peaceful settlement with the king. These efforts failed, and in the ensuing battle, on 10 July, Bourchier's half-brother Buckingham died fighting on the Lancastrian side. Henry VI was escorted into London by the Yorkists, and Bourchier was temporarily given custody of the seals, until the 25th. His brother Henry was again made treasurer, and they and the Nevilles assumed control over the administration. Even so, the archbishop was not yet ready to co-operate in the deposition of the king. York apparently failed to consult him before making his dramatic entry into the parliament chamber to claim the throne on 10 October, and Bourchier immediately showed that he did not condone the duke's repudiation of allegiance. However, two weeks later the Lords including Bourchier agreed to the compromise by which York should succeed after Henry VI's death. Only in February 1461, after York had been killed at Wakefield, and when the triumphant queen's forces were threatening London, did the archbishop concur that York's son Edward, earl of March, should be set on the throne in Henry's place. Initially he had fled with the chancellor, Bishop George Neville (<i>d</i>. 1476), to Canterbury, awaiting better news, but they returned to London where, at a meeting of the earl's council on 3 March, they agreed that Edward was now rightful king.<br>
<br>Bourchier's support for Edward IV from the first day of his reign is unquestionable. He was immediately ordained to be a councillor, with a salary of &pound;200 per annum, and on 28 June he set the crown upon Edward's head. Four years later, on 26 May 1465, he also crowned Edward's queen, Elizabeth Woodville. His wholehearted commitment to the new regime extended to financial support, both for the king himself, in the form of loans, and for the king's brothers, whom he assisted &#145;for a long time at great charges&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1467&#150;77</i>, 295&#150;6). Furthermore, he took on the trusteeship of estates belonging to other members of the royal family. It was a sign of his standing that from time to time he was commissioned to prorogue or dissolve parliaments in the king's place. For example, he dissolved parliament during Edward's absence on 2 May 1462, and acted as his locum for part of that of 1463&#150;5. As a reward, and also as a means of obtaining a show of papal support for the Yorkist dynasty, the king petitioned Pope Paul II (<i>r</i>. 1464&#150;71) to make Bourchier a cardinal in 1465, and it appears that he was actually named accordingly on 18 September 1467, although several years elapsed before the red hat was sent and his title of cardinal-priest of San Ciriaco in Thermis formally acknowledged in England. In 1469 the pope wrote to the king, promising that it should be dispatched shortly, but the readeption of Henry VI no doubt delayed its transmission further, and it was only sent by the succeeding pope, Sixtus IV (<i>r</i>. 1471&#150;84), in 1473. It was reported that Edward IV teased George Neville, now archbishop of York, by sending him the papal letter of 1467 naming Bourchier as a cardinal, when Neville had been blatantly seeking a similar position in Rome, and this may have soured Bourchier's own relations with the Nevilles, who at the start of the readeption had him arrested. Although he was released and summoned to the 1470 parliament, he and his brother Essex secretly worked for Edward's restoration both by mediating with the duke of Clarence, whom they succeeded in winning over to his brother's cause, and by raising armed retinues to bolster Edward's forces. The archbishop sent a timely warning to Edward not to land at Cromer, Norfolk, which was well defended, and following his successful landing further north Bourchier welcomed him to London on 11 April 1471. After the victory at Barnet on the 14th he was among the first to acknowledge Edward's newly born son as prince of Wales, and was one of those appointed to counsel the prince and administer his lands during his minority. In the 1470s Bourchier remained a prominent member of the king's council, and in 1475 when Edward IV set out with his army for France, he was nominated to the executive body left in control of English affairs. In the agreement made between Edward IV and Louis XI at Picquigny, the cardinal was named as one of just four arbitrators (two from each country) to whom the differences between England and France were referred. Rewards for Bourchier's services included valuable wardships, notably those of the heirs of the duke of Buckingham and Lord Latimer.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsanddeath"></a>Last years and death</h2>In 1480, feeling the effects of age, Bourchier appointed a suffragan, but three years later, after the unexpected death of Edward IV, he was again called upon to take part in public affairs. On 2 May 1483 the young Edward V, on his way to London, wrote to him requesting him to see to the safety of the Tower and the treasure there, and five days later Bourchier took official custody of the royal jewels and seals, as the executors of Edward IV's will hesitated to act. He saw that the funeral expenses of nearly &pound;1500 were paid. Surprisingly, during the critical two weeks at the end of May and beginning of June he withdrew from London to Knole, but then, on 16 June, as the head of a deputation from the council, he played a crucial part in persuading the king's mother to deliver up her second son, Richard, duke of York, from sanctuary at Westminster to the keeping of his uncle the protector, Richard of Gloucester. To what extent deception was practised on him by the protector remains uncertain. Domenico Mancini, an eyewitness, claimed that Gloucester surrounded the abbey with troops, and that the cardinal, &#145;suspecting no guile&#146;, sought only to prevent violation of the sanctuary  (<span class="italic">Usurpation</span>, 88). There is no reason to suppose that he either encouraged or resisted Gloucester's usurpation, although it may well have caused him unease. He crowned him Richard III on 6 July, although Mancini says he was reluctant to do so, and he did not attend the coronation banquet. His favourite nephew, Sir Thomas Bourchier of Berners, joined the rebellion against the new king in the autumn, and the archbishop thought it prudent to procure a royal pardon for himself on 8 December. Henceforth there is no record of his attendance on Richard's council. He crowned Henry VII on 30 October 1485, and on 18 January 1486 married him to Elizabeth of York.<br>
<br>In 1456 Bourchier had purchased from Lord Saye and Sele the manor of Knole in Sevenoaks, which he adopted as a favourite residence, altered substantially, and bequeathed to the see of Canterbury. Margaret Paston had remarked in 1469 that he was &#145;an old man&#146; who might &#145;happe to dye&#146; at any moment  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, 1.337), but he lived on for seventeen more years. In his will, dated 27 March 1486, he left several valuable images, jewels, and vestments, and a great bowl of gold (this last to be kept as a family heirloom). His bequests of &pound;100 each to the universities for the creation of loan chests to benefit poor scholars, while generous, nevertheless compare poorly with the great foundations at Oxford of his contemporaries Henry Chichele and William Waynflete. He died at Knole three days later, and was buried beneath an imposing monument next to the high altar in Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
