<span class="headword">Tuchet,  James</span>, seventh Baron Audley  (<em>c.</em>1463&#150;1497), <span class="occ">rebel leader</span>, was the second son, and heir, of John Tuchet, sixth Baron Audley (<i>d</i>. 1490), and Anne Echingham. James Tuchet's first wife was Margaret Dayrell and his second, by 1488, was Joan Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1532), daughter of Fulk, Lord Fitzwarine, and Elizabeth, Lady Dinham. In the 1470s and 1480s the Audley family was part of the Yorkist political connection. Tuchet's elder brother, Edward (<i>d</i>. 1478), was a godson of Edward IV and henchman to Edward, prince of Wales, while John, his younger brother, was married to an illegitimate daughter of Edward IV. Tuchet himself was created a knight of the Bath at the investiture of Edward as prince of Wales in 1475. His father became lord treasurer of England in 1484.<br>
<br>The first mention of James Tuchet in Henry VII's reign is at the baptism of Prince Arthur in 1486, when he helped to bear the infant's train. Tuchet fought at East Stoke on 16 June 1487. In 1490 he inherited his title. The Audleys were a north Staffordshire family, but they had residences at Shere, Surrey, and at Nether Stowey, Somerset. Tuchet lived there having, to all intents and purposes, severed any connection with Staffordshire. He was a justice of the peace in the early 1490s, and attended parliaments in 1491, 1495, and 1497. In 1492 he took a small retinue&#151;three men-at-arms, twenty half-lances, twenty foot and twenty mounted archers&#151;to France. Here he set his name to a petition by which the Lords requested Henry VII to settle his differences with Charles VIII. It is possible, though unlikely, that this action gave rise to the story that Audley lost his fortune in France, became bitter, and therefore rebelled in 1497. His last recorded public act, before rebellion, was in August 1496. As one of a group of important westerners he stood bail for Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset, to ensure his loyalty during the forthcoming campaign against James IV of Scotland. Audley himself was appointed to serve in the royal vanguard in June 1497.<br>
<br>Rebellion broke out in Cornwall in May 1497 when taxes were levied to pay for the war with Scotland. The rebels marched to Somerset and established headquarters at Wells. Here Lord Audley became one of the leaders with Michael Joseph the Blacksmith and Thomas Flamank. The commanders attempted to secure Bristol for their cause, but failed, and may have sent letters inviting Perkin Warbeck to invade England. From Wells they marched on London, via Salisbury, Winchester, Farnham, and Guildford. It is possible that some opposition was encountered in Hampshire, but no important fighting occurred until the rebels reached Guildford. None the less, a force of between 8000 and 10,000 men arrived at Blackheath on 16 June 1497. On the next day the rebels were defeated in battle and Lord Audley was captured. Along with Michael Joseph and Thomas Flamank, Audley was examined by Henry VII and his council. On 27 June he was tried at Whitehall. Found guilty of treason, he was taken to Newgate prison. The next day he was marched through London in a surcoat of paper bearing his coat of arms cut to shreds&#151;a slight on his treacherous nobility. He was beheaded on Tower Hill and his mortal remains were buried at Blackfriars, Ludgate.<br>
<br>Lord Audley's reasons for joining the rebellion have always been obscure. A context for his involvement is provided by the knowledge that more than twenty-four Somerset gentlemen were also involved. The normal suggestion&#151;that Audley was poor&#151;must be dismissed as speculation since the value of his lands at his death was reckoned at &pound;1200. Political alienation at displacement from power by Sir John Cheyne, a mid-western favourite of Henry VII, is a possible explanation. Audley's action is placed in a wider context by the wavering allegiance of George Neville, Lord Bergavenny, and the welcome given by some of Audley's servants to Perkin Warbeck when he arrived to begin a second, autumn, rebellion. Audley's background&#151;his father's intimacy with Edward IV and his brother John's marriage to one of Edward's bastard daughters&#151;might argue overtly political motives. If by John Audley's marriage to Edward's daughter the Audleys are considered within the extended Yorkist royal family then James, Lord Audley, was brother-in-law to the putative Richard, duke of York, Perkin Warbeck. An invitation to Warbeck to enter England, and the June rebellion, might in this light be seen as an attempt to engineer a coup either for Warbeck or for the Yorkist heir to the throne, Edward, earl of Warwick.<br>
<br>In the event Audley's action was a disastrous miscalculation of the political will of the realm. He was attainted in 1504, but the breakup of the family estates began even before his execution. His heir John was restored to the blood in 1512, but the price of his restoration was so high that he was plunged into a humiliating cycle of debt, terminated only by sales of the family lands in 1535. James Audley's widow fared even worse. By 1510 she was described as prostrated and in the care of her mother-in-law. In 1515 her prostration was termed insanity. Her death in 1532 allowed James's son John to recoup some of the family fortune, but not before his uncle, another John, who had accompanied his father in rebellion, and supported Warbeck in 1498 and 1499, contested his right. The ruination of the Audleys was the direct result of James's wild misjudgement of 1497.<br>
