<span class="headword">Hughes,  Mary</span>  (1860&#150;1941), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 29 February 1860 at 80 Park Street, Mayfair, London, the youngest of the nine children (four daughters and five sons) of the Christian socialist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14091/', "Thomas Hughes (1822&#150;1896)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Tom Brown's Schooldays</span>, and his wife, Anne Frances Ford (<i>c</i>.1826&#150;1910). The social interventionist Jane Elizabeth Senior (Mrs Nassau Senior) was her paternal aunt. She was educated by governesses at home. From the age of twenty-three she kept house for her uncle John Hughes, vicar of Longcot, Berkshire, where she became a poor-law guardian and district councillor.<br>
<br>In 1896 Mary Hughes moved to the East End of London as an unofficial, voluntary parish worker at St Jude's, Commercial Road, Whitechapel, where her sister Lilian was the wife of the vicar, the Revd Henry Carter. There she began her real life's work of sharing&#151;and trying to shoulder&#151;the troubles of the most afflicted, despairing people in London. She went into the slum dwellings, the workhouses, the doss houses, the lock wards (where sufferers from venereal disease were treated), and the infirmary, growing more and more at one in solidarity with the outcast. To the respectable world it seemed that she became ever more careless of herself and her surroundings&#151;especially after she lost her sister and brother-in-law through the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>. In 1915 she moved into the community settlement Kingsley Hall in Bow. She lived on bread and margarine and vegetables with a very little cheese, and always refused a fire, declaring &#145;Indignation keeps me warm!&#146; &#145;For thirty years she had no new clothes, no holiday and no proper bed&#146;  (Pyper, 26). In 1917 she was made a JP for the Tower division, Shoreditch, sitting on rates and educational cases, sometimes being moved to tears by the tragedy behind the cases, and herself paying the fines the law demanded.<br>
<br>In 1918 Mary Hughes was accepted into the Society of Friends. She moved back to Whitechapel and became a poor-law guardian and regular visitor at the children's home and poor-law infirmary. Every day the unemployed would knock on the door of her two-room flat in Blackwall Buildings asking if she knew of any work available. In 1928 she moved to a converted pub at 71 Vallance Road, Whitechapel, which she renamed the Dew Drop Inn and offered as a social centre and refuge for the homeless of the neighbourhood. Predictably, the poorest were also verminous, and it was said of Mary Hughes that &#145;Her lice were her glory&#146;. She called herself a communist, acquiring the nickname Comrade, and took part in the marches of London's unemployed, no matter how threatening or how threatened they were by mounted police. &#145;She was always there&#146;, wrote Father Groser  (Hobhouse, 114). When Gandhi visited Kingsley Hall in 1931 he asked to see her. She died in the East End at St Peter's Hospital, Whitechapel, on 2 April 1941, a lifelong pacifist appalled by those Christians in Britain calling for retaliation against the German blitz. George Lansbury wrote: &#145;Our frail humanity only produces a Mary Hughes once in a century&#146;  (ibid., 92).<br>
