<span class="headword">Hincks,  Thomas</span>  (1818&#150;1899), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and naturalist</span>, was born on 15 July 1818 at Exeter, one of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13339/', "William Hincks (1793?&#150;1871)")</script>, Unitarian minister and naturalist, and his wife, Maria Ann Yandell (1788/9&#150;1849). His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13338/', "Thomas Dix Hincks")</script>, was a Presbyterian minister in Ireland, his uncle Sir Francis Hincks was prime minister of Canada, and another uncle, Edward Hincks, was an orientalist. From 1833 to 1839 he attended the Unitarian Manchester New College at York (where his father was on the staff), where he trained to be a minister; his first post was in Cork, Ireland, from 1839. In 1840 he gained a BA from London University. His rise in the Unitarian church was rapid. He held ministries at Eustace Street Chapel, Dublin; Warrington; Exeter; Upper Chapel, Sheffield; and, from 1855, at Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds, one of the most noted Unitarian congregations.<br>
<br>In 1846 Hincks married Elizabeth, daughter of John Allen of Warrington. In Leeds he was an active minister, from 1862 organizing an Old Scholars Society which met regularly for tea followed by a lecture. He also presided over the Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society for three years, and was responsible for arranging its museum. His bi-monthly <span class="italic">Mill Hill Chapel Record</span> ran for 102 issues, from January 1858. Many of his sermons were published. He also published a collection of fifty-two hymns (including three of his own) in 1868, the year in which he permanently lost his voice. He retired from the ministry in 1869, and moved first to Taunton and then to Stokeleigh, Leigh Woods, near Bristol.<br>
<br>As a zoologist Hincks specialized in two marine animal groups, the Hydrozoa and the Bryozoa. In retirement he continued with the biological research he had begun while serving as a minister, and he was elected FRS in 1872. Between 1851 and 1893 he published about fifty papers on Hydrozoa and Bryozoa, much of his research based on his own dredging off the coast of south-west England from Swanage to Devon, and especially around Salcombe. His <span class="italic">History of British Hydroid Zoophytes</span> (1868) and his <span class="italic">History of Marine Polyzoa</span> (1880) both remained standard works for more than a century. His <span class="italic">Collected Papers</span> (2 vols., 1894&#150;5) brought together the articles which he wrote over many years for the <span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>. His work was marked by precise observation, was prepared lucidly for publication, and was accompanied by highly accurate illustrations.<br>
<br>In later life Hincks continued with voluntary work for the Unitarian church, serving as honorary secretary of the Lewin's Mead Domestic Mission between 1886 and 1889. He also helped plan the 1898 Bristol meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science but was unable to attend due to failing health. He died at Stokeleigh on 25 January 1899 and was buried, at his own request, near Leeds. He was survived by his wife and his two daughters.<br>
