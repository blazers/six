<span class="headword">Tregelles,  Edwin Octavius</span>  (1806&#150;1886), <span class="occ">ironmaster and Quaker minister</span>, was born on 19 October 1806 at Falmouth, the youngest of the seventeen children (eight being twins) of Samuel Tregelles (1766&#150;1831), merchant and rope maker, and Rebecca (1766&#150;1811), daughter of Thomas Smith (1725&#150;1792), London silversmith and member of the Quaker banking firm of Smith, Wright, and Gray. His mother's surviving sister had married Thomas Fox (1747/8&#150;1821), a woollen manufacturer and banker at Wellington, Somerset. By 1827, when Tregelles attained his majority, his forty first cousins were nearly all intellectually vigorous as well as active in commerce or industry&#151;including such scientists as Robert Were Fox (1789&#150;1877) and Charles Fox (1797&#150;1878).<br>
<br>Samuel Tregelles had been one of the twelve partners (mainly of the Fox family) in the Perran foundry, near Falmouth, from its establishment in 1791. The following year the partners had leased the Neath Abbey ironworks and in 1820 Edwin Tregelles was apprenticed to his cousin Joseph Tregelles Price (1784&#150;1854) who had succeeded his father, Peter Price, as managing partner of the Neath Abbey Iron Company, as it was called from 1818. Tregelles was joined there by his brother Nathaniel (1803&#150;1887) who remained until 1847. Edwin himself was a man of conscientious&#151;some in the family thought over-conscientious&#151;scruple and in 1831, rather than be a party to supplying machinery for a Newport brewery, he resigned his position.<br>
<br>Tregelles's work for Neath Abbey had involved extensive travelling and at Youghal, co. Cork, he had seen much of Abraham Fisher, a Quaker miller whose daughter Jenepher (1808&#150;1844) he married on 5 July 1832: there were three children. He had meanwhile set up in business on his own account as a civil engineer, superintending the introduction of gas lighting to many towns in the south of England. He was appointed (1835) engineer of the Southampton and Salisbury Railway; he was engaged in surveying for the West Cornwall Railway; and he reported (1849) on the water supply and sewerage of Barnstaple and Bideford. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 March 1850, but resigned in 1861.<br>
<br>By the time of his election Tregelles had become a tinplate manufacturer at Shotley Bridge, co. Durham. On 4 December 1850 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Richardson (1813&#150;1878): there were no children. Her brother Jonathan Richardson (1802&#150;1871) founded in 1841 the Derwent Iron Company of which her brother-in-law Jonathan Priestman (1825&#150;1888) was later managing director. Tregelles also involved himself in the family's coal interests but in 1853 retired from business and devoted himself entirely to Quaker and philanthropic work. He had begun to speak in Quaker meetings about 1828, his spiritual life by then being much affected by the deaths of seven of his brothers and sisters. His gift in the ministry was recorded by South Wales monthly meeting in 1837. His early travels in the ministry included the Isles of Scilly; Ireland (1839) with Robert Were Fox; the West Indies (1843&#150;4) with James Jesup (1796&#150;1868); and Norway (1846) with Isaac Sharp (1806&#150;1897) and John Budge (1787&#150;1864).<br>
<br>Tregelles's interest in temperance developed into advocacy of total abstinence and he served on the council of the United Kingdom Alliance. He was active in 1855 in the relief of distress in the Hebrides and was engaged, often accompanied by his wife, in numerous journeys in the ministry in Scotland and the north of England. Throughout his life he had a particular concern for the children in Friends' schools: his sister Rachel (1805&#150;1874) was from 1853 to 1862 superintendent of the Quaker York Quarterly Meeting Girls' School, supervising its removal in 1857 from Castlegate to The Mount.<br>
<br>From 1837 Tregelles suffered indifferent health and following the death of his second wife he suffered severe illness, but was able to spend the winter of 1882 visiting the small groups of French Quakers at N&icirc;smes and Congenies. Short attacks of illness continued, however, and he died of &#145;natural decay [and] cardiac degeneration&#146; on 16 September 1886 at the home of his elder daughter and son-in-law, Gertrude M. (1833&#150;1932) and Charles (1830&#150;1895) Gillett, Wood Green, Neithrop, Banbury, where he had been living: his body was interred in the Quaker burial-ground, Sibford Gower, Oxfordshire, five days later.<br>
