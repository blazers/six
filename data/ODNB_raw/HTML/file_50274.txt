<span class="headword">Reid, Sir  Edward James <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>, second baronet  (1901&#150;1972), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 20 April 1901, of Scottish descent, at 28 St James's Place, London, the eldest son of Sir James Reid, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1923), physician to Queen Victoria and later monarchs, and his wife, Susan, formerly maid of honour to Queen Victoria and daughter of the merchant banker Edward Baring, first Baron Revelstoke. Baptized in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, on 7 May 1901, Reid's early life was spent in court circles; Edward VII suggested himself as Reid's godfather, and he was a page to George V. He won a scholarship to Eton College and was awarded a first-class degree in classics at King's College, Cambridge, where, three years running (1920&#150;22), he was a Browne medallist for his renderings of epigrams in Greek. He succeeded his father as second baronet in 1923.<br>
<br>A year earlier, Reid had joined Baring Brothers, the London merchant bank then led by his uncle, the second Baron Revelstoke, who in 1924 sent him to learn about cotton trade finance in Barings's Liverpool office. Shortly afterwards he worked with the firm of Kidder Peabody in New York and Boston.<br>
<br>Reid's mastery of languages caused his uncle in 1925 to dispatch him to Barings's Hamburg correspondents, Berenberg Gossler, to watch over the rapidly expanding business they did on joint account with Barings. As a director in London from 1926, he expertly led Barings's banking activities. With rapidly increasing competition, he proved to be an adroit merchant banker, especially in the mid-1920s, when he organized what he reckoned to be &#145;the greatest coup in cotton financing that Barings Liverpool ever brought off&#146;  (Barings archives, DEP 22.xxiii, fol. 29). In December 1928 he was admitted to the partnership, which effectively controlled Baring Brothers. He married on 18 January 1930 Tatiana (<i>d</i>. 1992), daughter of Colonel Alexander Fenoult, formerly of the imperial Russian guard, and they had a son and daughter. When Reid retired from Baring Brothers in 1966, in terms of the number of years' service, he was senior partner. He emerged as a distinguished banking technician and for twenty years served as chairman of the Accepting Houses Committee (1946&#150;66), and was president of the Institute of Bankers (1962&#150;4).<br>
<br>The soundness of Reid's German contacts was proved when Baron von Berenberg Gossler gave him early warning of impending difficulties leading Barings to scale down its German business before Germany's economic collapse in 1931. Barings, therefore, escaped the damage inflicted upon its competitors and, with limited conflict of interest, Reid was well positioned to take a major role in the ensuing negotiations concerning German foreign indebtedness. They dominated much of his life for the next thirty years.<br>
<br>While he was much concerned with the negotiation of the German &#145;standstill agreements&#146;, following the suspension of payments on short-term credits by German and other central European countries, Reid's role was subsidiary to that of others, especially Frank Tiarks of Schroders. It was more prominent when Germany defaulted on part of its long-term foreign debt in 1933, when Reid dealt with the Konversionskasse f&uuml;r Deutsche Auslandsschulden on behalf of the London issuing houses of German securities (1933&#150;9). In 1934 it fell to him to put into effect the mechanics of the Anglo-German payments agreement whereby British creditors received Konversionskasse funding bonds.<br>
<br>From 1948 until 1962 Reid was chairman of the British bankers' committee for German affairs, in which role he petitioned the British government for full recognition of the banks' claims. He also served on the distribution committee formed under the <span class="roman">Distribution of German Enemy Property Act</span>, and played a key role representing the banks' claims against those of a wide range of creditors, especially holders of United States government bonds, at the 1952 international conference on Germany's pre-war debts. For his City work he was made a KBE in 1967. His close German connections made him especially useful to British intelligence pre-war, and from 1940 to 1945 he was a civil assistant attached to the general staff.<br>
<br>Reid's interests outside banking were closely connected with Scotland. He was especially associated with the Royal Caledonian Schools, which &#145;took up most of my spare time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scotland</span>, August 1962). These schools cared for children whose parents could no longer look after them. He was a Church of Scotland elder, a governor of Guy's Hospital (1938&#150;48), and treasurer of London's Infants' Hospital (1938&#150;46). Honorary president of the Clan Donnachaidh Society, Reid was also a member of the council of the Scottish Craft Centre (1966&#150;71).<br>
<br>On retirement Reid returned to his much-loved Scotland about 1969, living in Edinburgh and at Ellon Castle, Aberdeenshire. He died of a &#145;Stokes Adam attack&#146; at his home, 16 Buckingham Terrace, Edinburgh, on 24 February 1972. His funeral was held at Dean parish church, Edinburgh, followed by cremation. He was survived by his wife.<br>
