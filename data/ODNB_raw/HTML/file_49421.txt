<span class="headword">Winnebald</span> <span class="st"> [St Winnebald]</span>  (<em>c.</em>702&#150;761), <span class="occ">abbot of Heidenheim</span>, was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29575/', "Willibald")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28427/', "Walburg")</script>, of a noble Wessex family. He did not follow his elder brother into the monastery of Waltham, but he gladly accompanied Willibald and their father on pilgrimage to Rome in the years 720&#150;21; their father died on the way to Rome, at Lucca, and was buried there. The brothers led a life of monastic asceticism when they finally arrived in Rome. Both were stricken by plague and, perhaps because of lingering illness, Winnebald remained in Rome when Willibald left for the Holy Land in 723. Between 723 and 727 Winnebald acquired his training in theology, living in an ascetic community. He returned once to England, in 727, to encourage yet another brother to the service of God. This unnamed brother returned with Winnebald to Rome, where they must have formed part of the considerable Anglo-Saxon community in that city.<br>
<br>Boniface summoned Winnebald to Germany in 739; he spent a brief period in the monastery of Ordrop (Ohrdruf), and was ordained in the same year. Until 744 he undertook missionary work in Thuringia, overseeing seven churches there. It was here that, after eighteen years' separation, he was reunited with his brother Willibald, who had also been called by Boniface. From 744 to 747 Winnebald struggled against apostasy and idolatry in the remote and dangerous Nordgau area of Bavaria; in 747 Boniface called him to Mainz, where he was an effective preacher. Here Winnebald became noted for his abstention from wine and refusal to participate in social entertainments. Fearing for his vocation among the looser standards of the city, <i>vini opulentia monachicalem frangeret vitae disciplinam</i> (&#145;lest the abundance of the wine destroy his discipline&#146;; Bauch, 152), Winnebald became anxious to return to a monastic life. Willibald arranged for him to set up the monastery of Heidenheim in 751, clearing the land and building first huts, then more substantial buildings. The battle against apostasy, witchcraft, sexual immorality, superstition, and idolatry was an exhausting one. Winnebald's health had always been poor&#151;he seems to have suffered from some form of arthritis&#151;and his last years were overshadowed by illness. He hoped to retire to the monastery of Monte Cassino, but his illness made it impossible. He died on 18 December 761, in the presence of Willibald, and was buried the following day. A number of miracles followed, as attested by Hugeburc of Heidenheim, who wrote a life of Winnebald between 778 and 781. Walburg, Winnebald's sister, inherited the monastery. Willibald arranged for his brother's translation in 777, proclaiming his sanctity. The three siblings were reunited when Winnebald's relics were transferred, along with those of Walburg, to Eichst&auml;tt, Willibald's resting place, probably in 879.<br>
