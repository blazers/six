<span class="headword">Penley,  Aaron Edwin</span>  (1806&#150;1870), <span class="occ">painter and drawing-master</span>, was born on 20 May 1806 at Rye, Sussex, the fourth son of William Penley (1773&#150;1838), a comedian at the Drury Lane Theatre, London, and his wife, Frances Mary Ann Saulez; his brother William Henry Saulez was also a drawing-master. Penley married Caroline Turner (<i>d</i>. 1889) of Sheffield on 10 March 1830, and the couple had eighteen children, of whom a daughter and two sons survived into adulthood: the watercolour painter Charles Penley and Claude, who became a lawyer. Aaron Penley was self-taught and the first recorded event in his career came in 1834 with the award of the Heywood medal from the Manchester Institution for an oil of <span class="italic">Christ Granting the Petition of the Woman of Canaan</span>. He made his d&eacute;but at the Royal Academy a year later with three portraits and exhibited there sporadically until 1869; his exhibits included genre scenes and, latterly, landscapes in watercolour. Penley also showed at the British Institution and the Society of British Artists, but his main allegiance was to the New Society of Painters in Water Colours which he joined in 1838 and where he showed 309 works. He also received royal patronage. He was appointed painter in watercolour to Queen Adelaide, painted a miniature of Queen Victoria (1840; NPG) from an actual sitting, and taught her son Prince Arthur.<br>
<br>Penley also enjoyed success as a drawing-master. During the 1830s he built up a practice in the Southampton area and, between 1836 and 1842, at Devonport. In 1843 he moved to Bath to take up an appointment at Cheltenham College, and after a move to London in 1849 was appointed assistant professor of civil drawing at the East India Company's college at Addiscombe. Penley was an innovative teacher, introducing instruction in the art of photography, and was promoted to senior professor in 1855. When the college closed in 1861 he moved to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. His teaching experience informed a series of publications including <span class="italic">A System of Water-Colour Painting</span> (1850), <span class="italic">The Elements of Perspective</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Sketching from Nature in Water Colours</span> (1869), and, most impressively, <span class="italic">The English School of Painting in Water-Colours</span> with colour illustrations in chromolithography (1861). The last was notable for the use of new colours such as viridian and aureolin which Penley introduced into Britain.<br>
<br>Penley is best known today for the technically competent, but rather conventional, exhibition landscapes which he showed at the New Society of Painters in Water Colours. The <span class="italic">View of Ullswater from Gowbarrow Park, at Evening</span> (exh. 1854) typifies a strand of unadventurous mid-Victorian watercolour art which combined a well-known location, conventional composition, and an attractive effect. The artist travelled widely in Britain and his repertory included scenes from Scotland, Yorkshire, the west country, and Wales, as well as south-east England. Although Penley's exhibited works could be overworked, his watercolour sketches retain a more attractive spontaneity. Penley died at his home, 5 Elliott Hill, Lewisham, on 15 January 1870 of heart disease. There are representative collections of his work in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
