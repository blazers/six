<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Amelia <span class="st"> [Emily]</span>, Princess</span>  (1711&#150;1786), <span class="occ">daughter of George II</span>, was born on 30 May/10 June 1711 at the palace of Herrenhausen in Hanover, Germany, the summer residence of her grandfather, Georg Ludwig, elector of Hanover (from 1714 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10538/', "King George I of Great Britain")</script>), the second daughter of Georg August (1683&#150;1760), electoral prince of Hanover (after 1727 elector of Hanover and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10539/', "King George II of Great Britain")</script>), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4720/', "Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1683&#150;1737)")</script>. Her full names were Amelia Sophia Eleonora. In October 1714, shortly after her grandfather acceded to the British throne, she and her sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68369/', "Anne (1709&#150;1759)")</script> and <a href="#cosubject_77212">Caroline Elizabeth [<i>see below</i>]</a>, accompanied their parents to England, where the family was installed in St James's Palace. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10140/', "Frederick Lewis (1707&#150;1751)")</script> remained in Hanover.<h2>
<a name="Formativeinfluences"></a>Formative influences</h2>Amelia's later taste for intrigue may well have been formed by the ongoing familial power struggles that involved her from as early as December 1717, when her parents were ordered to leave St James's Palace by George I. The king insisted, however, that the children remain. Although he and the prince and princess of Wales were fond of the children, they were pawns in the adults' power game. When the king granted the princess of Wales but not the prince easy access to the children, the prince promptly brought a lawsuit to try and secure their return to his care. He found to his chagrin that in England royal grandchildren belonged to the crown: he could not force the king to return them, nor could he even control their education. Tensions between the two royal households gradually receded after 1717, but the king and prince were not officially reconciled until 1720, and even then their relationship was never smooth. For Amelia and her sisters the reconciliation brought little change: they remained in the king's household at St James's, subject to every shift in family affections. In 1722 Amelia and Caroline attracted widespread public notice when they were inoculated against smallpox using a method only recently brought to England by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. The process was still so new as to generate debate in England and be viewed with alarm by relatives on the continent. Fortunately, all went without incident.<br>
<br>Amelia (or Emily, as she was often called in Britain) benefited from the joint efforts of two intelligent women: her mother and Johanne Sophie, countess of Schaumburg-Lippe, whom the king had placed in charge of the princesses' household. Consequently she grew up well educated, trilingual (in English, German, and French), highly politicized, latitudinarian in religion, and fond of music, especially that of Handel. She was clever and articulate, but also, less flatteringly, bluntly outspoken, often to the point of tactlessness, impatient, and generally ill-suited to the machinations of a court and its politics. She particularly lacked the patient subtlety and flattering emollience needed to negotiate successfully the ever shifting alliances, deep family divisions, and contending political factions that came to dominate her father's court. Nor did her character lend itself to the prevailing ideals of passive submissive femininity. As a young woman, she was drawn far more to the stables than to the drawing-room or ballroom. She enjoyed fishing and loved horses. An avid hunter, she soon earned the reputation of being the hardest rider after stags in the royal family. Even when she was over forty she was still capable of shocking the &#145;good women&#146; at Hampton Court by attending chapel on Sunday &#145;in riding clothes with a dog under her arm&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.341).<h2>
<a name="Socialandpoliticallife"></a>Social and political life</h2>Walpole's tone of studied amusement is reflective of his ambiguous feelings towards Amelia. A member of her inner circle of acquaintances for fifty years, he wavered continually between being inordinately proud and flattered to be a favourite and being sharply critical of her character and behaviour. He preferred pretty, pliant, conventional women who wore their intelligence lightly; it is not surprising that he found Amelia's forthright assertiveness, occasional arrogance, and tendency to disregard convention somewhat grating. More unfortunately for her historical reputation, however, she was also exactly the wrong sort of woman to appeal to the leading memoirist of George II's court, the exquisitely effeminate John, Lord Hervey. His dislike of her as a woman was exacerbated by the fact that he saw her as a rival, first for the attention of the prince of Wales and then, more importantly, for that of the queen. His description of her in 1734, when she was only twenty, paints her as darkly as possible for posterity:<blockquote>[she] was glad of any back to lash, and the sorer it was the gladder she was to strike. She had much the least sense (except her brother) of the whole family, but had for two years much the prettiest person. She was lively, false, and a great liar; did many ill offices to people and no good ones; and for want of prudence said almost as many shocking things to their faces as for want of a good-nature or truth she said disagreeable ones behind their backs. She had as many enemies as acquaintances, for nobody knew her without disliking her, nor was anybody acquainted with her without knowing her; and everybody in the Court being of the same opinion about her, people spoke their opinion with as little caution as variation. (Hervey, 81)</blockquote>While Amelia's acerbic tongue could make enemies, it was also one of her attractions. Lady Louisa Stuart, who encountered her in old age, was more even-handed than Hervey when she described Amelia as:<blockquote>a woman of quick parts and warm feelings, but without Lady Yarmouth's <i>bonhommie</i>, [who] knew more of the world than princes usually do; partly from native sagacity, partly from keeping better company and having a mind above that jealous fear of the superior in understanding. (introduction, in <span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.lxxxi)</blockquote>However, even she noted that the inflated mock grandeur of her relative, Lady Mary Coke, could try the princess's patience sorely. Still, Amelia managed to stay on good terms with Lady Mary for over twenty years, quite a feat in itself. Indeed, over the years she gathered around her a group of intelligent, often witty, well-read and politically aware intimates, including ladies of her household such as Lady Cecilia Isabella (Bell) Finch, who became lifelong friends and acquaintances. While Walpole occasionally complained that her regular lev&eacute;es and private parties were stuffy and &#145;trist&#146;, he continued to attend and take part in their fine mixture of social and political gossip, their discussions of the latest political tracts and literature, and their never-ending games of loo.<br>
<br>Amelia's life would undoubtedly have been very different had George I lived long enough to carry out his plan for a double marriage between his Hanoverian and Prussian grandchildren. He had intended her to marry Prince Frederick of Prussia (after 1740 Frederick II, &#145;the Great&#146;), but negotiations collapsed following the accession of George II to the throne in 1727. As there were few other suitable protestant princes and, it seems, marriage to a British commoner was never considered, Amelia had no choice but to remain single. She and Caroline remained unmarried while Anne married William, prince of Orange, in 1734; the younger sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18253/', "Mary (1723&#150;1772)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77213/', "Louisa")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68369/', "Anne, princess royal")</script>], married respectively Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel in 1740 and Frederick V, king of Denmark, in 1743. Although Walpole suggests that Amelia held out hopes for a marriage as late as the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, this seems unlikely given her age. As the first unmarried adult English princesses in living memory, she and Caroline, who maintained their own households, were both central and marginal to the court and its politics. Superfluous to the succession, they were doubly hampered by gender: traditional options open to younger sons were closed to them. Following the death of her mother in 1737, Amelia, as the eldest of the widowed king's daughters resident in Britain, became the highest-ranking woman at court. Her proximity to the king and his known reliance on female advisers in the past meant that she could have significant political influence. This situation would have been ideal for a woman with real political ability. Amelia, however, lacked the interpersonal skills and the necessary political sense to use to advantage the queen's death and the factional politics of the 1740s. Her jealousy of her father's politically astute mistress, Amalie von Wallmoden, countess of Yarmouth, limited her influence with her father and his ministers from the outset. Furthermore, in the late 1740s she aligned herself politically with her younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29455/', "William Augustus, duke of Cumberland (1721&#150;1765)")</script>, and his political cronies, the hot-headed John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, and his supporters, thereby choosing allies who were distrusted by the king, the prime minister Henry Pelham, and the reversionary interest of her brother Frederick's court at Leicester House. Her continued support of her brother William after the death of the prince of Wales in 1751, and the part that she reputedly played in influencing the king against Augusta, dowager princess of Wales, in the subsequent regency debate, earned her the lasting dislike and distrust of both the princess of Wales and her son, the future George III.<h2>
<a name="TheRichmondParkaffair"></a>The Richmond Park affair</h2>Amelia was appointed ranger of Richmond Park in 1751, gaining her own residence for the first time at New Lodge. Her period as ranger brought her notoriety and revealed her inability to see the political consequences of her actions. It resulted in a series of lawsuits as she tried, ultimately unsuccessfully, to limit public access to the park and traditional rights to gravel, wood, and water. In attempting to close the park to the public after 1751 and make it accessible only to a select group of friends and those neighbours who had been granted special passes, she also gained, for historians such as E. P. Thompson, a high place on the list of arrogant aristocratic landowners intent on removing common rights from the &#145;people&#146;. She was by no means alone in what she was doing, however, and would probably have succeeded with a minimum amount of fuss had her estate been elsewhere. Like many contemporary landowners she was a firm believer that private property should be private&#151;and that estates should be closed to the public. Even Walpole noted that in closing Richmond she was only &#145;imitating what the Duke has done at Windsor&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.322). The problem arose from a combination of factors: her rank&#151;as a member of the royal family, she was expected to set an example for the rest of the country; her gender&#151;her actions went against gender stereotypes which defined women as caring, considerate, and philanthropic by nature; the location of Richmond Park&#151;it was far too close to London and the vocal London press for her actions to remain unnoticed; and the nature of the &#145;public&#146; that she was excluding&#151;not a group of untutored and impoverished rustics, but prosperous members of the middling sort and substantial tradesmen and artisans who felt that their traditional liberties were being threatened and who were more than ready to use all methods available to them to combat the perceived injustice.<br>
<br>Under the capable direction of a brewer, a stonemason, and a shoemaker, the closure of the park became a public issue. They organized public meetings, printed memorials in the press (particularly the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>), and even gathered a substantial number of signatures on a petition which they had presented to the king. In the end, they had recourse to the law. In a series of judgments between 1754 and 1758, Amelia was forced to grant the public rights to use the ancient footways across the park. These cases, especially the last at the Surrey Lent assizes of 1758 before Sir Michael Foster, were high-profile affairs. In a society that was still highly deferential, the idea of trying a case against a member of the royal family posed particular concerns for the jurors. Foster was forced to put a talesman on the jury and fine absentees &pound;20 each in order to ensure that they did their duty. And they did. As a result of the final verdict in 1758, the public was given access to the park via stepladders (gates could be closed; stiles and ladders could not so easily be stopped). When <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104997/', "John Lewis")</script>, the brewer who had brought the successful case of 1758, returned to the court to complain that the rungs of the ladders were set too far apart for children and old men, Foster specified that they be changed so as to accommodate &#145;not only children and old men, but OLD WOMEN too&#146;  (Thompson, 113). After this ruling Amelia withdrew from active involvement in the park, so it is possible that she did not see the transfer of the rangership to John Stuart, third earl of Bute, in 1761 as a great loss.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>After her father's death in 1760, Amelia lost her apartments at St James's Palace, but received a pension of &pound;1000 p.a. on the Irish establishment and a household of three ladies of the bedchamber. She took Sir Richard Lyttelton's house in Cavendish Square and, following the loss of New Lodge with the rangership of Richmond Park in 1761, she bought Gunnersbury House in Ealing, Middlesex. George III was hostile to female politicians and his ministers were opposed to Amelia, so she lost what special political influence she had enjoyed. However, her later years were perhaps her happiest, devoted as they were to her circle of acquaintances and her estate at Gunnersbury, where she improved the gardens and built a temple and shell grotto bath house. Although she became increasingly arthritic, deaf, and blind as an old woman, she remained interested in political developments and characteristically opinionated. Despite the poor relationship she had with George III, she refused to use her electoral interest as a landowner in Middlesex against the king. She was highly incensed when, during the Middlesex election of 1774, William Ponsonby, second earl of Bessborough, used her name without her permission to support Hervey Morres, second Viscount Mountmorres, an opposition candidate supported by her despised other nephew, William, duke of Gloucester. Amelia disapproved strongly of the behaviour of George III's younger brothers and later his sons, and this may have been behind her decision to leave her estate to her German nephews, the second and third sons of her sister Mary, landgravine of Hesse-Cassel.<br>
<br>Amelia died at her house in Cavendish Square, London, on 31 October 1786, and was buried on 11 November in the royal vault in Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey. A frustrated politician, she was by temperament prevented from making the most of the possibilities open to her through gender, birth, and circumstance.<h2>
<a name="PrincessCaroline"></a>Princess Caroline</h2>Amelia's next youngest sister, <a name="cosubject_77212"></a><span class="headword">Princess Caroline Elizabeth</span>  (1713&#150;1757), <span class="occ">daughter of George II</span>, enjoyed a similar but quieter life. She was born on 30 May/10 June 1713 at Herrenhausen, and moved to Britain with her sisters in 1714. After the death of Queen Caroline in 1737 she took some responsibility for the upbringing of her younger sisters Mary and Louisa. In the 1730s and early 1740s she enjoyed a close friendship with Lord Hervey. In 1743 Horace Walpole reported that her marriage to Duke Adolphus Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, later king of Sweden, was being discussed at the initiative of Russia, but Caroline remained unmarried. She suffered increasingly from ill health and in the 1750s went into &#145;absolute confinement&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.165) in St James's Palace. She died on 28 December 1757 at St James's Palace, and was buried on 5 January 1758 in Henry VII's chapel, Westminster Abbey.<br>
