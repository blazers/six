<span class="headword">Czarnikow,  (Julius) Caesar</span>  (1838&#150;1909), <span class="occ">sugar broker</span>, was born at Sondershausen, Germany, the third son in a family of seven sons and two daughters of Moritz Czarnikow (<i>b</i>. 1795), agent and commissioner of commerce to the prince of Sondershausen, and of his wife, Johanne Bar (<i>b</i>. 1812), who had married in 1828. The family origins were probably Polish-Jewish, and Johanne was certainly Jewish.<br>
<br>Little is known of Czarnikow before 1854, when he joined a London sugar broker as a clerk. Early on he was especially connected with the broker firm of Weber and Biddulph, which provided him with useful introductions to the Biddulph and Martin banking families. In 1861 he took British nationality and became a &#145;sworn broker&#146; by licence of the corporation of London; both were essential preliminaries to establishing in March 1861 his own business of Czarnikow &amp; Co., colonial brokers. In 1863 he married Louisa, daughter of the late Revd Spencer Ashlin, a Scottish nonconformist minister; they had a son, Horace, later of Cranford Hall, Northampton, and a daughter, Ada Louisa, later the wife of Colonel Charles Jenkinson. His wife, for long an invalid following a carriage accident, died in 1911.<br>
<br>Czarnikow specialized in the raw sugar trade when sugar consumption was rising rapidly and when beet sugar was replacing cane. He dealt in beet sugar from when it was first exported from Germany and in this presumably enjoyed a competitive advantage, though his rivals reckoned that &#145;an almost uncanny&#146; ability to &#145;foreshadow market movements&#146; was the real secret of his success  (Janes and Sayers, 53).<br>
<br>In 1871 and 1881 Czarnikow established agencies in the major refining centres of Glasgow (Czarnikow and Boog) and Liverpool (Czarnikow and Cox), and in 1891 he opened a New York business (Czarnikow, MacDougall &amp; Co.). His firm became especially known for its weekly market circular, known generally as &#145;Czarnikow's Circular&#146;, first published in 1863. &#145;Probably everyone in the European and TransAtlantic sugar trade would agree that in many respects the Circular is second to none&#146;, reckoned one observer  (Hutcheson, 127). By then Czarnikow had emerged as a major figure in the international sugar trade and he enjoyed excellent contacts in the City, especially with German houses such as Schroders and Kleinworts. His firm maintained a distinctive German character: two English employees named Smith were differentiated as &#145;Grosser Smith&#146; and &#145;Kleiner Smith&#146;, and his partners at the time of his death were all continental migrants to the City of London.<br>
<br>In 1888, in an attempt to win back to London trade lost to new continental futures exchanges and in the face of fierce opposition from London's established brokers, Czarnikow was the leader in forming the London Produce Clearing House, the forerunner of the International Commodities Clearing House and the City's first futures market. He was its deputy chairman (1888&#150;1907) and later its chairman (1907&#150;9). He also chaired Sena Sugar Factory Ltd, formed in 1906 and owner of sugar estates in Mozambique. He opposed sugar bounties and favoured empire preference.<br>
<br>Caesar Czarnikow was short and stocky, had unflagging energy, and smoked large cigars. His leadership was autocratic and he was impulsive and short-tempered; he was capable of sacking and re-employing the same person on the same day. He was also penny-pinching, but his generosity was referred to and his most noted charitable act appears as a &pound;1000 donation to the Zoological Society of London for the construction of an aviary at London Zoo. Possessing a passion for flowers and animals, Czarnikow once owned, <i>inter alia</i>, monkeys, emus, eagles, and, briefly, a bear.<br>
<br>In 1901 Czarnikow acquired a country estate at Effingham Hill, Surrey, and he lived at 103 Eaton Square, London, where he died suddenly from a heart attack on 17 April 1909; he had done a full day's work the day before. He was buried at Effingham on 21 April 1909. His leadership in the international sugar trade was then without dispute. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> described his business as &#145;the largest of its kind in the world&#146;; three years earlier a leading City banker had observed that &#145;he seems to be known as a sort of king of the sugar market &hellip; &amp; to be the best judge of the sugar market going&#146;  (Kynaston, 337). His son never joined the Czarnikow partnership and his family's connection with the firm ended soon after his death.<br>
