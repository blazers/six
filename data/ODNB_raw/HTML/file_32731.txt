</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davidson, Sir  John Humphrey</span>  (1876&#150;1954), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in Mauritius on 24 July 1876, the son of a merchant, George Walter Davidson, and his wife, Johanna Smith Humphrey. He was educated at Harrow School from 1890 to 1893, and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before joining the 1st battalion of his regiment, the King's Royal Rifle Corps, in Mauritius in 1896. The battalion was in South Africa when war broke out against the Boer republics in October 1899. Davidson had a good war, serving with his battalion at the battle of Talana and in the operations around Ladysmith in Natal, and later on attachment to locally raised irregular cavalry units pursuing the Boer commandos. By the end of the war he had won the DSO and been mentioned in dispatches, and had been promoted captain.<br>
<br>After the war Davidson served in Malta, and with the international force in Crete, before being nominated for entry to the Staff College, Camberley, in 1905. On 12 December 1905 he married Margaret, daughter of John Peter Grant, of Rothiemurchus, Inverness-shire. They had one daughter. In a succession of staff appointments before the First World War, Davidson (or Tavish, as he was known universally throughout the army on account of his Scottish origins) demonstrated his considerable talent for staff work: as general staff officer, grade 3, in the directorate of military training at the War Office from 1908 to 1910; as brigade major of the 5th infantry brigade between 1910 and 1912; and as instructor in training and tactics and general staff duties at the Staff College from 1912 to 1914.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war Davidson, now holding the rank of major, took up his duties as general staff officer, grade 2 (intelligence) for the 3rd army corps and took part in the principal engagements of the 1914 campaign: the battles of the Marne, the Aisne, and first Ypres. Towards the end of that year his talent for staff work was brought to the attention of Sir Douglas Haig, the commander of the First Army corps, when, on attachment to that corps, Davidson organized the relief of the Indian corps from their difficult position on the River Lys. On the formation of the First Army under Haig's command in January 1915 Haig selected Davidson as his principal operations officer. In this capacity Davidson took part in the planning of the principal British engagements of the 1915 campaign, Neuve Chapelle, Aubers Ridge, and Loos.<br>
<br>When Haig replaced Sir John French as commander-in-chief of the British armies in France and Flanders in December 1915 Davidson accompanied him to general headquarters (GHQ) as director of military operations. Like Colonel John Charteris, Haig's much maligned director of military intelligence, Davidson, as one of Haig's trusted inner circle, had unrestricted access to his chief and was in a position to influence his decisions. Davidson's task was, after strategic consultation with the French commander-in-chief, to put his chief's tactical intentions into concrete form and pass them on to subordinate army commanders and executive field officers. In such a role Davidson was a key link in the operational chain of command, accompanying his chief to most allied and army commanders' operational conferences. Yet Davidson was more than a mere messenger, for it was his tactical appreciations and operational instructions that formed the basis of British military doctrine and action during Haig's period of command. Although identified by one of Haig's biographers as among the &#145;circle of simpering awestruck admirers&#146; surrounding the commander-in-chief  (de Groot, 220), Davidson was more than a mere cipher for his chief's views. He was not afraid to incur Haig's wrath, as when, during the preparations for the Anglo-French offensive of spring 1917, he reported his unfavourable impression of the military situation on the French front.<br>
<br>Like his fellow officers Davidson was learning his trade in the testing school of battle on the western front. While it is impossible to quantify the influence Davidson exercised over the details of operational planning, it would be na&iuml;ve to assume that he was entirely innocent of the charges subsequently levelled against GHQ of tactical inflexibility and poor strategic judgement. Yet Davidson's measured and thorough approach to operational planning stands out; it is perhaps unfortunate that in the planning of the third battle of Ypres in the summer of 1917 his argument for a steady succession of limited offensives did not prevail over the more ambitious schemes of Haig and the commander of the Fifth Army, General Sir Hubert Gough. Unlike Charteris, Davidson remained secure at GHQ until the end of the war, and so must take some credit for the new combined arms operational methods which swept the British army to success in the Last Hundred Days of war. By 1918 Davidson had risen to the rank of major-general. Among numerous British and foreign honours and decorations for his war service Davidson was awarded the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur in 1916, and appointed CB in 1917 and KCMG in 1919. He left the army in 1922.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Davidson entered parliament unopposed as MP for the safe Unionist seat of Fareham in Hampshire. As a member of parliament he took an active interest in service questions, taking a leading role on the House of Commons army committee. He was a determined advocate of the reorganization of Britain's peacetime defence administration to create a unified Ministry of Defence, and led the army committee's 1920 deputation to the prime minister advocating such a ministry. In and outside parliament Davidson took an active interest in ex-servicemen's welfare; in parliament as chairman of the parliamentary select committee on the training and employment of ex-servicemen; and outside parliament as a founder and chairman of the King's Roll National Council and president of the Union Jack Club.<br>
<br>Davidson resigned his parliamentary seat in 1931 to concentrate on his business interests. He held a number of company directorships, including a seat on the board of the armaments manufacturer Vickers. Between 1937 and 1949 he was chairman of the Bank of Australia. He was colonel commandant of his regiment from 1937 to 1945. Yet his most formative experience remained his period of service at GHQ in the First World War. In later life he published <span class="italic">Haig: Master of the Field</span> (1953), a belated but impassioned defence of his former chief, and indirectly of his own part in the British army's victory.<br>
<br>Davidson died at Glack, Daviot, Aberdeenshire on 11 December 1954. He left a small collection of private papers, which were deposited at the National Library of Scotland.<br>
