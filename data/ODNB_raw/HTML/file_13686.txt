<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hook,  Theodore Edward</span>  (1788&#150;1841), <span class="occ">writer and hoaxer</span>, was born on 22 September 1788 at 3 Charlotte Street, Bedford Square, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13683/', "James Hook (1746&#150;1827)")</script>, composer, and his wife, Elizabeth Jane Madden (<i>d</i>. 1795). Theodore Hook was educated at private schools, and subsequently for a short time at Harrow School. He was, according to his own account, principally distinguished at school for mischief, deceitfulness, and a lack of serious application. Such a natural talent for raillery was fostered by an early introduction to the theatrical world as author of the words for the songs of his father's comic operas, a predilection he shared with his mother and elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13684/', "James Hook (1772?&#150;1828)")</script>. Theodore Hook's libretto for the <span class="italic">Soldier's Return, or, What Can Beauty Do?</span> (1805), a comic opera in two acts, earned him &pound;50 when he was only sixteen. Sometimes in conjunction with his father, sometimes independently, he produced during the next five or six years a number of farces and melodramas. One of the latter, <span class="italic">Teleki</span>, in which the hero is hidden in a barrel on the stage, was ridiculed by Byron in <span class="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</span> but proved a popular success. Hook's achievements as a writer, however, were at least matched by his penchant for clever practical jokes and, in particular, by his skill in perpetrating hoaxes.<br>
<br>The most celebrated of Hook's hoaxes was the Berners Street hoax of 1809. This hoax, aimed at a Mrs Tottenham, against whom Hook had grievances, was undertaken with two accomplices and was six weeks in preparation. Having falsely ordered a range of goods and sent out bogus invitations to dignitaries and notables, Hook and his accomplices watched from a room opposite as wagonloads of coal from the Paddington wharves, upholsterers' goods in cartloads, organs, pianofortes, linen, jewellery, and all types of furniture arrived in unison at the woman's Berners Street door. The lord mayor of London, governor of the Bank of England, chairman of the East India Company, and the duke of Gloucester were equally tricked into making an appearance. An amused crowd blocked the street for the entire day; yet, although he was suspected, Hook escaped without his involvement being proved.<br>
<br>Hook next took up residence at St Mary Hall, Oxford University, but left after two terms to resume his high-spirited life. He became acquainted with the Revd E. Cannon and other favourites of the prince of Wales and it was probably through their influence and that of his brother that, at twenty-four and utterly unacquainted with business, he obtained the post of accountant-general and treasurer at Mauritius, where he arrived in October 1813. This apparently miraculous piece of good fortune proved his ruin. An examination into the state of the treasury in 1817 revealed a shortfall of $62,000, for which Hook could offer no explanation. His property was confiscated and he was sent home. On his return to England the case was investigated by the Treasury who, though discovering no grounds for criminal proceedings, seized his remaining property. He was imprisoned from 1823 to 1825. Despite for many years receiving an ample income from his writing, he never attempted to discharge any portion of his admitted liability.<br>
<br>Long before his release from gaol Hook began making his living with his pen. In 1811 the two farces <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span> and <span class="italic">Darkness Visible</span> were staged, and in 1819 and 1820 appeared the clever farce <span class="italic">Exchange No Robbery</span>, brought out under the pseudonym Richard Jones, along with <span class="italic">The Arcadian</span>, a short-lived magazine, and <span class="italic">Tentamen, or, An Essay towards the History of Whittington, Sometime Lord Mayor of London</span>, a satire on Queen Caroline and Alderman Wood. The latter achieved great success and, combined with the general recommendation of Sir Walter Scott, saw Hook appointed as the editor of the <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, established in late 1820 to counteract the popular enthusiasm for Queen Caroline. Hook's penchant for comedy and faculty for improvisation were never displayed to so much advantage as in this scurrilous, but irresistibly facetious, journal. He was the prince of lampooners, exuberant, polished, and energetic and <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, along with <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span> and the <span class="italic">North Briton</span>, can be counted as one of the most influential English publications of its time. &#145;It is impossible to deny&#146;, said the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, &#145;that <span class="roman">&#147;Bull&#148;</span> frightened the Whig aristocracy from countenancing the Court of Brandenburg House. The national movement was arrested and George IV had mainly <span class="roman">&#147;John Bull&#148;</span> to thank for that result&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 77). It also produced another, far less satisfactory result: when Hook's long concealed identity leaked out it became impossible for the Treasury to ignore his previous financial mismanagement.<br>
<br>In the meantime Hook was dissipating his energies in a number of abortive literary projects, rather than concentrating them in the journal, so much so that, despite some years of unparalleled success, it eventually ceased to be financially viable. Between 1826 and 1829 he did, however, produce nine novellas under the collective title of <span class="italic">Sayings and Doings</span>, for which he received almost &pound;3000. The best known are &#145;Martha the Gypsy&#146;, in which a respectable Londoner is cursed by a Gypsy for refusing to give alms, &#145;Passion and Principle&#146;, &#145;Cousin William&#146;, a story about dark passion, and &#145;Gervase Skinner&#146;, about a miser who loses his money. Hook well understood his method of framing story in humorous incident and social observation. &#145;Give me&#146;, he said, &#145;a story to tell, and I can tell it, but I cannot create&#146;  (Barham, 169). The hero of <span class="italic">Maxwell</span> (1830), his next and most carefully constructed novel, is a close portrait of his friend Cannon, while his later works <span class="italic">Gilbert Gurney</span> and <span class="italic">Gurney Married</span> (1836 and 1838) are thinly disguised portraits and a string of anecdotes from real life. They appeared in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, of which he became editor, in 1836. In the interval he had written <span class="italic">The Parson's Daughter</span> (1833) and <span class="italic">Love and Pride</span> (1833); <span class="italic">Jack Brag</span>, published in 1836, is a satire on freeloading. Turning to biography, he published in 1832 a life of Sir David Baird, rewrote reminiscences of Michael Kelly, and began a life of Charles Mathews, which was discontinued following differences with his family. Hook's last novel of importance was <span class="italic">Births, Marriages and Deaths</span> (1839), a novel about jealousy. His health failing, works after this are believed to be only partially from his own hand.<br>
<br>Hook died at his house, Egmont villa, in Fulham on 24 August 1841, &#145;done up&#146;, as he said, &#145;in purse, in mind and in body&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 100). His effects were seized by the crown as preferential creditor, but his family were provided for by subscription (although he never married, he and Mary Anne Doughty, with whom he lived, had six children). Tellingly, except for support from the king of Hanover, this subscription did not include support from his aristocratic patrons. He was, wrote John Gibson Lockhart, editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, &#145;human, charitable, generous. &hellip; and there was that about him which made it hard to be often in his society without regarding him with as much of fondness as of admiration&#146;  (ibid., 104). He appears in Disraeli's <span class="italic">Coningsby</span> as Lucian Gay and in Thackeray's <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> as Lord Steyne's toady Mr Wagg. Coleridge, a contemporary, described him as being &#145;as true a genius as Dante&#146;  (ibid., 66). Hook's genius lay in his extremely sharp wit and his clever improvisations. His hoaxes are as indicative of this as his prose.<br>
