<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anson,  Thomas Patrick John</span>, fifth earl of Lichfield <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Patrick Lichfield]</span>  (1939&#150;2005), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 25 April 1939 at 16 Embankment Gardens, Chelsea, London, the only son and elder child of Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913&#150;1958), army officer, and elder son and heir of the fourth earl of Lichfield, and his wife, Anne Ferelith Fenella Bowes-Lyon (1917&#150;1980), later (following their divorce in 1948 and her remarriage in 1950 to Prince Georg of Denmark) Princess Anne of Denmark. His mother was a niece of Queen Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, who stood sponsor at his christening, and he was first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II. He and his sister, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1941), a party organizer, grew up with their father and grandfather at the family seat, Shugborough Hall in Staffordshire, with its 5000 acre estate.<br>
<br>Anson was educated at Harrow School, where he began his career as a professional photographer by charging his friends 9<i>d</i>. for the leaving pictures he took with his Kodak Retinette, and at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where in 1957 he joined the regular army as an officer cadet, and was commissioned lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards in 1959. On 14 September 1960 he succeeded his grandfather as fifth earl of Lichfield, and ran what was left of the Shugborough estate after making over most of it to the National Trust, though he retained a thirty-five-room apartment. He resigned his commission in 1962 to take up photography, and worked as a darkroom technician for Dmitri Kasterine and Michael Wallis. A technically proficient craftsman, he was never afraid of advances, and enthusiastically embraced digital photography.<br>
<br>Though born to be a society photographer (and he did many portraits of d&eacute;butantes, signed Lichfield rather than Patrick Lichfield, which he reserved for his more serious work), Lichfield was lucky to start out in an era when photography was a chic profession&#151;whose members, though mostly working-class, included two earls, Snowdon, who, as Lichfield said, was a photographer who became a lord, and himself, a lord who became a photographer. He created some of the defining images of the 1960s and 1970s, such as a 1968 photograph of a nude Marsha Hunt, the African-American star of the rock musical <span class="italic">Hair</span>. (He had shrewdly invested in <span class="italic">Hair</span> and <span class="italic">Oh! Calcutta!</span>) Mick Jagger and David Bailey posed for him, as did Joanna Lumley and Jane Birkin, and he made the iconic &#145;Swinging London&#146; group portrait with Roman Polanski, David Hockney, and Lady Antonia Fraser. Later he took pictures of his own relatives in the royal family, of which the best known were those of a relaxed duke of Windsor (his good humour helped by Lichfield having fallen through the seat of a chair), and his pictures of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer's wedding in 1981. Clicking his tongue to make the noise of a shutter, he deceived his rival photographers into using up their quota of exposures, leaving him alone to capture the famous shot of the bridal group collapsing in a heap of giggles after the formal shoot was finished. The portraits he made of most members of the royal family at work and on holiday contributed a good deal to the prevailing spirit of informality of the Windsors.<br>
<br>Lichfield married, to great fanfare on 8 March 1975, Lady Leonora Mary Grosvenor (<i>b</i>. 1949), daughter of Robert George Grosvenor, fifth duke of Westminster, and sister of the sixth duke of Westminster. He was a devoted father to their three children, Rose (<i>b</i>. 1976), Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1978), and Eloise (<i>b</i>. 1981), though the marriage ended in divorce in 1986, owing something, he thought, to the fact that he was a workaholic who spent an average of 200 nights a year in hotels.<br>
<br>Slim and elegant, despite his slightly absurd bouffant hair-do, with his beautifully tailored clothes, and seldom without a crisp, white pocket handkerchief, Lichfield was a fixture of the glamorous London social scene that began in the 1960s. He was a director of some London restaurants, including the casual chain Deals, which he ran with Eddie Lim and David Linley, and a dining club in Mayfair called Burke's that he opened with Doug Hayward, the society tailor. Thanks to Diana Vreeland, the celebrated (and helpfully snobbish) editor of American <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, he had a ten-year contract with the magazine that put him in the highest rank of British photographers, which included Cecil Beaton, Lord Snowdon, David Bailey, and Norman Parkinson. He published a dozen books, mostly of his photographs.<br>
<br>At his holiday home on Mustique in 1991 Lichfield suffered serious injuries in a fall. He was cared for by his partner, Lady (Mary) Annunziata Asquith (<i>b</i>. 1948), with whom he had done a stint as models for a Burberry advertising campaign in the late 1980s. She was the eldest daughter of Julian Edward George Asquith, second earl of Oxford and Asquith. Lichfield died of a stroke, arterial disease, and emphysema on 11 November 2005 in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. He was survived by Lady Annunziata Asquith and by the three children of his marriage, and was succeeded as sixth earl by his son, Thomas.<br>
