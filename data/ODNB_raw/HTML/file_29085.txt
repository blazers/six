<span class="headword">West,  James</span>  (1703&#150;1772), <span class="occ">politician and antiquary</span>, was born on 2 May 1703 and baptized on 21 May at St Swithin's, London Stone, the only son of Richard West, of London and Prior's Marston in Warwickshire, and his wife, Mary Russell, of Strensham, Worcestershire. He was educated from 1720 at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated BA (1723) and proceeded MA (1726), and from 1721 at the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar in 1728, and on 23 January 1738 was admitted at Lincoln's Inn. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1761, reader in 1767, and treasurer in 1768.<br>
<br>From a young age West engaged in the study of antiquities and science. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 23 November 1726, acted as the society's treasurer from 30 November 1736 to 30 November 1768, and served as its president from the latter date until his death. He became FSA on 23 November 1726, and on 19 February 1729 was elected a member of the Spalding Society. As a trustee of Lady Oxford's estates, he completed the sale of the Harleian manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 for &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>West collected books, manuscripts, pictures, prints, plate, coins, and medals, but lost many items, valued at almost &pound;3000, through a fire in his chambers at the Inner Temple on 4 January 1737. Undaunted, he subsequently gathered around him a marvellous library and curiosities of all kinds at his town house, situated at the west end of the piazza in King Street, Covent Garden. His country seat was at Alscott, Preston-on-Stour, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>West reputedly revived the &#145;love of black-letter lore and of Caxtonian typography&#146;  (Dibdin, 376&#150;84). He greatly assisted James Granger in his biographical work on portraits, and he subscribed for Hearne's books and gave him a plate for Domerham's <span class="italic">Glastonbury</span> (1727). He also assisted in Walter Hemingford's <span class="italic">History of Edward I, II, and III</span> (1731).<br>
<br>On 15 August 1738 West married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1799), the daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Steavens, a timber merchant at Southwark and of Eltham in Kent. Ultimately, the marriage brought him &pound;100,000 to add to the &pound;1000 per annum left to him by his father. The couple had a son, James (<i>d</i>. 1795), and two daughters: Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1801), who became the wife of Andrew, second and last Lord Archer, and Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1815).<br>
<br>At the general election in 1741 West was returned as MP for St Albans, Hertfordshire, and continued to represent the borough until 1768, when he was elected for Boroughbridge, Yorkshire. Between 5 April 1758 and July 1760 he was recorder of St Albans and from 23 November 1759 its high steward. From 1746 he was also recorder of Poole, Dorset. In December 1743 he was appointed secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, an office he held until May 1752. He was also joint secretary to the Treasury from May 1746 until November 1756, when he resigned with his patron, the duke of Newcastle, who secured for him a pension of &pound;2000 per annum. He returned to government as joint secretary in July 1757, and once again resigned with Newcastle in May 1762. When Rockingham began forming an administration in July 1765, Newcastle pressed for the reinstatement of many of his former adherents. West became the unfortunate victim of Rockingham's decision to assert his independence, being turned down for a return to the Treasury as treasurer to the navy, and even for a consolatory groomship of the chamber for his son. All this he bore uncomplainingly, and in January 1768 he was formally reconciled with Rockingham. He continued to send Newcastle frequent and valuable reports of parliamentary proceedings.<br>
<br>West died on 2 July 1772. In the early months of 1773 his extensive collections were all sold. The manuscripts, including many which had belonged to Bishop Kennett, were purchased by Lord Shelburne, and now form part of the Lansdowne manuscripts at the British Library. Horace Walpole considered that the prints went for a &#145;frantic sum&#146;, while the books were &#145;selling outrageously&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 5.439, 455). The books alone realized &pound;2927 1<i>s</i>. Gough bought many of them, particularly those with Kennett's annotations, and they afterwards went to the Bodleian Library.<br>
