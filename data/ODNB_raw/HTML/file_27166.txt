<span class="headword">Thelwall, Sir  Eubule</span>  (<em>c.</em>1557&#150;1630), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the fifth son of John Wyn Thelwall (<i>c</i>.1528&#150;1586) of Bathafarn Park, Llanbedr, Denbighshire, and Jane (1525&#150;1585), daughter of Thomas Griffith of Pant-y-llondu, Llanasa, Flintshire.<br>
<br>Thelwall was educated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1577. He was incorporated at Oxford, where he proceeded MA in 1580, and looked set for an academic career until his enrolment at Gray's Inn in 1590, when he must have been over thirty. Thanks to leases of lands from his family's patron, the countess of Warwick, he was already a man of some means when called to the bar in 1599, and he gradually built up an extensive estate in the lordship of Ruthin, Denbighshire, of which he became recorder in 1604. Appointed an associate bencher of Gray's Inn in 1612, master in chancery and clerk of the alienations office in 1617, and a full bencher at his inn in 1623, he may have owed much of his preferment to his Gray's Inn colleague Francis Bacon. He was knighted on 29 June 1619.<br>
<br>One of Thelwall's first acts as a chancery master was to secure an increase in the fees his department was allowed to charge, buying Bacon's support with a gratuity of &pound;1200. This bribe came to light during Bacon's impeachment in 1621, when both Thelwall's actions and the remit of his office were attacked in parliament by Sir Edward Coke. Presumably as a result of this mauling, Thelwall took care to secure himself a Commons seat (for Denbighshire) in 1624, when he attempted to procure the abolition of the subpoena office, whose fees would have reverted to the chancery masters. He was noticeably slower to leap to the defence of his superior, Lord Keeper John Williams, when the latter faced impeachment charges, which may explain why Williams supported a rival candidate for the Denbighshire election in 1625.<br>
<br>Denied a seat on this occasion, Thelwall was returned for Denbighshire again in 1626, when he filed a petition against Lewis Bayly, bishop of Bangor, in whose diocese he lived, accusing the latter of simony, embezzlement, assault, and fornication, and of nominating unqualified men &#145;and others &hellip; that understand not the [Welsh] language&#146; to benefices  (Bidwell and Jansson, 3.5); the investigating committee did not report before the dissolution, at which time one of his enemies reported a rumour that Thelwall had been arrested. He played a more constructive role in the Commons during the sessions of 1628 and 1629, seeking to smooth the passage of the subsidy bill and the petition of right, steering the Denbighshire copyholders' bill through committee, and making an impassioned speech for a better preaching ministry:<blockquote>I think it is time to complain of ministers when I, that have a dozen or fourteen of them within ten mile of me round about, the least of their benefices to the value of &pound;50 <i>per annum</i>, may ride my horse a month and not hear a sermon. I believe they are not busied as they should be, and therefore it is time to think of a reformation. (Cole, 3.436)</blockquote>If somewhat ruthless in his professional dealings, Thelwall was also noted for his charitable works. At Gray's Inn he supervised the building of the chapel and paving of the courts, while at Jesus College, Oxford, of which he became president in 1621, he secured the first proper set of statutes for the college, and was said to have invested nearly &pound;5000 of his own money in the chapel and library, in addition to donations he solicited from other Welsh alumni.<br>
<br>Thelwall never married, and at his death on 8 October 1630 his estate was divided between his financier brother Sir Bevis Thelwall and several nephews. He was buried in the chapel of Jesus College, which still owns a portrait of him as a child.<br>
