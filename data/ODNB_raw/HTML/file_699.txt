<span class="headword">Arrowsmith <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Bradshaw, Rigby]</span>,  Edmund <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Bryan]</span></span>  (1585&#150;1628), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born at Haydock in the parish of Winwick near Warrington, Lancashire, the son of Robert Arrowsmith, a yeoman farmer, and Margery Gerard, a member of a Lancashire family well known for its adherence to Catholicism. Baptized Bryan, he took Edmund as his confirmation name after his arrival at Douai. Both parents were Catholics who suffered for their faith. Robert and his oldest son Peter fought on the continent. Originally forced to assist the Dutch, both allegedly fired their muskets into the air lest they wound any Catholic. Eventually they joined Sir William Stanley's regiment. Peter was wounded in service of Spain and died in Brussels. After a brief visit to his brother Edmund Arrowsmith, a secular priest on the faculty at Rheims or Douai (the lack of specific dates precludes certainty) Robert Arrowsmith returned to England and died shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>Because of the poor financial straits of his widow, a secular priest in Lancashire took Bryan Arrowsmith into his service in order to assist the mother and to educate the child. At first he seemed dull and slow, but later proved to be an apt student. In December of 1605 he arrived at the English College in Douai. After a few months he returned to England for medical reasons but upon recovery set out again for Douai, arriving on 15 May 1607. Often ill during his studies, his training was hastened so that he could return to England to breathe his native air. Ordained priest in Arras on 9 December 1612 he was sent on the English mission on 17 June 1613. Some time during his sojourn in Douai he made the spiritual exercises of St Ignatius of Loyola under the direction of a Jesuit spiritual father. As a consequence he longed to enter the society.<br>
<br>In England Arrowsmith recovered his health and worked in Lancashire. According to an anonymous fellow worker Arrowsmith was very zealous<blockquote>especially against an heretic, and so forward that often I wished him merrily to carry salt in his pocket to season his actions, lest too much zeal without discretion might bring him too soon into danger, considering the vehement, sudden storms of persecution that often assailed us. (Foley, 2.29)</blockquote>Arrested, perhaps in 1622, he was examined by John Bridgeman, bishop of Chester, before being pardoned and released.<br>
<br>On 21 July 1623 Arrowsmith entered the House of Probation of St Ignatius, the Jesuit noviciate established in London probably in or near the French embassy in Blackfriars. Although the Jesuit catalogues list him there during his two-year noviceship, a contemporary claimed that he did no noviceship but &#145;labour[ed] amongst us, except for some ten or twelve days once a year for a spiritual recollection, at a place where the Jesuits used to meet in Lancashire for that end&#146;  (Foley, 2.32). After his noviceship he was sent to the College of Blessed Aloysius, that is, the Lancashire district.<br>
<br>Angry because of disagreement surrounding a marital dispensation, a Mr Holden and his wife betrayed Arrowsmith, who was apprehended a second time shortly before the summer assizes of 1628. Tried before Sir Henry Yelverton he was convicted of being a priest and a Jesuit. On 28 August 1628 he was drawn to the place of execution on a hurdle, and after having been hanged, his body was cut down, dismembered, disembowelled, and quartered. His head, as the sentence directed, was set up upon a pole among the pinnacles of Lancaster Castle, and the quarters were hung on four parts of the building.<br>
