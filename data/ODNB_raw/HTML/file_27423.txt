<span class="headword">Thynne,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Tom of Ten Thousand]</span>  (1647/8&#150;1682), <span class="occ">landowner and murder victim</span>, was the only surviving son of Sir Thomas Thynne (1609/10&#150;1669?) of Richmond, Surrey, and his wife, Stuart or Stuarta, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1151/', "Walter Balcanquhall (c.1586&#150;1645)")</script>. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 14 December 1666, aged eighteen, and was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1668. Following the death in 1670 of his uncle, Sir James Thynne, he succeeded to the estate of Longleat in Wiltshire. His nickname, popular at the time, derived solely from his wealth and his love of extravagance. Thynne was an active parliamentarian, being a member for Wiltshire from 1670 to 1682. At first he appeared to favour the court in his politics and was fairly intimate with the duke of York and his friends; only later did he express those country and whig views that led him into opposition. By 1674 he had become an opposition leader in Wiltshire, as well as a deputy lieutenant and a colonel in the local militia. Depicted as &#145;Issachar, his wealthy western friend&#146; in John Dryden's notorious satire <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span> (line 738), Thynne was a close associate of the duke of Monmouth. Sir John Reresby too claimed that Thynne was one that had opposed the court's interest and &#145;engaged himselfe in that of the Duke of Monmouth&#146;  (Geiter and Speck, 243).<br>
<br>Thynne would not have been averse to holding government office, but he was not noted for his intellectual abilities. In the event he became an exclusionist in the early 1680s. Indeed on 22 January 1680 Thynne, Sir Walter St John, and Sir Edward Hungerford presented a petition from Wiltshire to the king for the sitting of parliament, to which Charles II replied that Thynne was an &#145;Impertinent foole to meddle with what did not concerne him&#146;  (Knights, 235). Undeterred, Thynne also entertained Monmouth during his western tour of 1680, but in the latter stages of the exclusion crisis he appeared to begin to shift his political position. He was associated with Ralph Montagu and tried, in vain, to obtain the office of the secretary of state.<br>
<br>It was in his personal life that Thynne gained most notoriety. Thynne was noted as one always &#145;very civill [to the ladies] and allways courteuse &amp; debonnaire&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 37047, fol. 244). Like most of his companions he was a man of loose character and notoriously seduced Miss Trevor, one of the queen's maids of honour, with promises of marriage. As a consequence he was involved in a duel in the spring of 1678. In July 1681 he married Elizabeth, countess of Ogle (1667&#150;1722), daughter and heir of Josceline Percy, eleventh earl of Northumberland (1644&#150;1670) and widow of Henry Cavendish, earl of Ogle, having paid a goodly sum of money to her guardians, since she was only fourteen years old. The marriage was never consummated, for Elizabeth, who continued to be known as Lady Ogle, having first taken the advice of Lady Temple, fled to the Netherlands. Thynne took legal action to ensure that he held onto her estate and that she be returned to Longleat. But his actions in marrying Elizabeth had also raised the jealousy of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68006/', "Count Karl Johann K&#246;nigsmark")</script>, one of her more unsuccessful suitors. It was later claimed that Thynne had merely ignored the many challenges sent by the count and even sought to rid himself of the count and his &#145;ancient&#146;, Captain Christopher Vratz, by hiring some men to kill them. An attack apparently took place, but failed and left Vratz wounded and burning for revenge against Thynne. Vratz subsequently recruited Lieutenant John Stern, another professional soldier, into his plans. There is little doubt that Vratz was also in communication with K&ouml;nigsmark over the affair. The latter was lying low in London, ostensibly recovering from a venereal disease. It was K&ouml;nigsmark who ultimately supplied the man who would kill Thynne: Charles George Borosky, alias the Polonian.<br>
<br>On Sunday 12 February 1682 Vratz informed Borosky that he had a quarrel with an English gentleman, had sent him two challenges, and had been ignored; and that as Thynne had attempted to have both himself and K&ouml;nigsmark murdered he was bent on revenge. He gave Borosky a musquetoon and reassured him that, as in Poland, servants were never held responsible for carrying out the orders of their masters. The pair soon joined Stern, who informed them that Thynne was out in his coach, and all three rode off in pursuit. They caught up with Thynne just after he had dropped off his passenger, the duke of Monmouth, at Hedge Lane and was proceeding up St James Street towards the countess of Northumberland's house. While Stern moved in front of the coach, Vratz and Borosky came up alongside. Vratz called on the coach to stop and as it came to a halt Borosky fired his weapon into it. Five or six shots hit Thynne in the stomach and hip, mortally wounding him. The trio then rode off in some haste. Thynne was taken home, where after &#145;languishing all night &hellip; between five &amp; six in the morning&#146; of 13 February he &#145;expired&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 37047, fol. 244). His body was subsequently embalmed, and buried in Westminster Abbey on 9 March. It was placed under a large and rather pompous tombstone that depicted his murder, but whose original inscription, firmly placing the blame for his death on Count K&ouml;nigsmark, was suppressed by the dean of the abbey. Thynne's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27424/', "Sir Thomas Thynne, later first Viscount Weymouth")</script>, went on to &#145;possess all his estates &hellip; [but] not his good nature&#146; according to one contemporary  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the killing Charles II was fearful that the whigs would attempt to make some political capital out of it; given the presence of Monmouth in Thynne's coach only moments before the murder this was highly likely. However, Vratz, Stern, and Borosky were soon arrested. K&ouml;nigsmark attempted to flee the country, but was captured while trying to escape on a vessel bound for Sweden. Brought back to London he denied any complicity in the murder and claimed to have only left London because he feared the rage of the mob. He was committed to Newgate, but Charles II was not keen to see the young man suffer too much for his crime. Indeed at the subsequent trial, having bribed some of the jury, K&ouml;nigsmark escaped punishment, while Vratz, Stern, and Borosky were all found guilty and went to the gallows on 10 March 1682.<br>
<br>Thynne's death, and his wealth, were ultimately the most remarkable things about the man. As a whig plutocrat of some note on the Wiltshire scene he at least believed himself worthy of higher office. Yet, although his association with Monmouth was central to his later career, there are hints that problems in his personal life, particularly those with his wife, led not only to heavy drinking but also to a potential political change of heart. At length, while whig propagandists sought to use Thynne's murder for political ends, and so tried to revive the heady days of the Popish Plot, this, like Tom of Ten Thousand's final reputation, was soon dissipated.<br>
