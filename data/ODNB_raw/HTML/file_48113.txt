<span class="headword">Ralph fitz Stephen</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1202), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was probably the son of Stephen, a royal chamberlain who appears on the 1156/7 pipe roll. With his brothers William and Eustace he served Henry II in a number of capacities, in a manner characteristic of the <i>familiares</i> of that king. He frequently witnessed royal charters, often designated king's chamberlain; his deed confirming an agreement between Worcester Cathedral priory and the nuns of Westwood in 1178 uses this title. From Michaelmas 1171 to Michaelmas 1175, throughout the period of baronial rebellion, he was sheriff of Gloucestershire (his brother William accounted on his behalf each year, and then replaced him as sheriff, holding office until 1189). He received money from Henry II's chamber from 1156/7 onwards, and was concerned with the maintenance of the king and royal family, including provision for Queen Eleanor in her captivity in the last decade of Henry's reign. In 1170 he was among the &#145;tutors&#146; of Henry, the Young King, with whom those wishing to approach the latter on Thomas Becket's behalf had to negotiate. In 1176 he was appointed a justice for the eyre in the south-west, and served as an assessor of tallage and a justice in several counties from then until 1190. He handled provisions and building works for the Carthusians at Witham (a royal foundation), accounted for Glastonbury Abbey's scutage in 1187/8, when the monastery was in the king's hand, and was probably the Ralph fitz Stephen who kept Guildford Castle in Surrey in 1192/3. Between 1176 and 1190 he accounted for the forest of Chippenham in Wiltshire, and from 1176 to 1197 for Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.<br>
<br>Ralph's rewards were as typical as his services. From 1161&#150;2 onwards he received pardons of scutages in several counties, under both Henry II and Richard I. In 1163 he received Winterbourne and Wapley, both in Gloucestershire, from the king, in 1189/90 making fine to have tenure of them for life&#151;Richard I confirmed him in them at Messina in April 1191. In 1184 or 1185 he married Maud, or Matilda, de Cauz, widow of Adam Fitzpeter and heir of half the Nottinghamshire barony of Shelford. John, count of Mortain, the future king, granted the hereditary forestership of Sherwood to Ralph, Maud, and their heirs. The returns to the 1166 inquest into feudal subtenancies had recorded him as holding one fee of the bishop of Exeter, half a fee of the honour of Totnes, and two fees of Hubert Fitzralph's honour of Crich in Derbyshire. He gave a fee held of Robert Fitzrandulf in Blackwell, Derbyshire, as a marriage portion with his niece Idonea to William Fitzrandulf. He was a benefactor of Haverholme Priory, Lincolnshire, Darley Abbey, Derbyshire, Gloucester Abbey, and Stanley Abbey, Wiltshire&#151;his grants to the latter were also confirmed by Richard I in 1191. Ralph fitz Stephen died on 25 July 1202. When Maud died, in 1224, John of Birkin, the son of her first marriage, made fine to have her lands and forest custody; in 1225 the king took homage from Richard of Gloucester, perhaps the son of Ralph and an earlier wife, as Ralph's nearest heir for Winterbourne.<br>
