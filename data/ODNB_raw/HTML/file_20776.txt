<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Hugh</span>, styled sixth earl of Tyrone  (<em>d.</em> 1660/61), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in the Spanish Netherlands the son of Art Oge O'Neill, who was the elder brother of Owen Roe O'Neill and nephew of Hugh O'Neill, the great earl of Tyrone; his mother was Helen (or Evelina) Mac Carthy. He served as a captain in the regiment of Tyrone, in the Spanish service, and had most recently been engaged in fighting Catalan rebels, before coming to Ireland in 1642 to serve in the Ulster army of the confederate Catholics. He was known as Hugh Dubh or Bu&iacute; because of his black hair and sallow complexion, respectively.<br>
<br>O'Neill was captured when local British forces routed the Ulster Irish army and creaghts at Clones in 1643. Ormond declined Owen Roe O'Neill's offer of an exchange and Hugh O'Neill remained a prisoner until released through exchange after the battle of Benburb in 1646. The following year he was appointed major-general of the Irish forces in Ulster, and they were partly under his direction during the illness of his uncle, General Owen Roe O'Neill, whose confidence he enjoyed, and by whom he was dispatched with 2000 soldiers to aid the marquess of Ormond against the Cromwellian forces. After Owen O'Neill's death, in November 1649, Hugh was, like his cousin Daniel O'Neill, one of the numerous unsuccessful candidates for the command of the Ulster army.<br>
<br>In February 1650 Ormond appointed O'Neill governor of Clonmel. He had under his command some 1200 men, of whom all but fifty-two were infantry, and with these forces he pursued an aggressive defence, mounting frequent sallies to cut off isolated parties of the besiegers. On 27 April Cromwell sited his siege batteries, prompting O'Neill to demand urgent relief from Ormond. The relief did not arrive and on 9 May, after opening a breach, Cromwell's soldiers stormed in: &#145;never was seen so hot a storm of so long continuance and so gallantly defended, neither in England nor in Ireland&#146;  (Whitelocke, 41). On pouring through the breach the attackers were canalized by newly erected embankments into a lane covered by two artillery guns. The gunners fired chain shot while other defenders raked the attackers with musket fire and missiles from the surrounding embankments and houses. Constricted and pushed forward by the press of bodies, some 2000 of the storming party were killed over the ensuing four hours before Cromwell finally called off the attack.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the garrison could not prolong the struggle, and in the dead of night O'Neill and his followers slipped away in the direction of Waterford, leaving instructions with the mayor to come to terms. On 10 May Cromwell received a deputation, and granted them terms. It was not until he got within the walls that he learned of the escape of the garrison. He kept his word, but sent in pursuit of O'Neill, and, according to Ludlow, killed 200 stragglers.<br>
<br>O'Neill subsequently commanded in Limerick during the siege by Ireton which lasted from May to October 1651. Again, he conducted an active defence, most notably when he annihilated a landing party which tried to establish a beachhead on King's Island preparatory to a general assault. By October, however, about a fifth of the townspeople and garrison had perished owing to the combined effects of famine and pestilence, and the demoralized citizenry sued for peace. In the articles for the surrender of Limerick, dated in October 1651, the governor, Major-General Hugh O'Neill, was excepted from quarter, and excluded from any benefit, on the ground that he had largely contributed to &#145;the long and obstinate holding out of the place&#146;. In conformity with them, O'Neill, as governor, on 29 October 1651 surrendered the city to Ireton, and was committed to prison. A council of war on the same day voted that O'Neill and others should be executed. In his defence, O'Neill insisted that he had not been guilty of any base or dishonourable act, having only discharged his duty as a soldier, and appealed to the justice of the lord deputy, Ireton. On 1 November, after reconsideration, the vote for the death of O'Neill was revoked, and it was determined to send him as a prisoner to be dealt with by the authorities of the parliament at London. This course, it would appear, was adopted mainly in consequence of his rights as a subject of the king of Spain (having been born in Flanders) and his numerous influential connections.<br>
<br>As a prisoner in the Tower of London, where he arrived on 10 January 1652, O'Neill was treated with consideration by the government, and allowed 20<i>s</i>. a week for his maintenance; he was also granted the privilege of having &#145;the liberty of the Tower&#146;. In July 1652 Cardenas, the Spanish ambassador at London, applied officially for his discharge from the Tower, on the grounds that he was a subject of the king of Spain, that he had not been guilty of excesses in Ireland, and that his liberation would promote the bringing together of the Irish soldiers then about to be levied for the Spanish service.<br>
<br>O'Neill was released in 1653 and made his way to Madrid. There, in December, he was tasked with mustering the many thousands of recently landed Irish scattered across Galicia and Cantabria and marching them to Aragon to fight the French. In October 1660 on the death of Hugh O'Neill, titular earl of Tyrone, Hugh Dubh succeeded to the title. In that same month he addressed a letter from Madrid to Charles II and the marquess of Ormond asking that his family be &#145;restored &hellip; to a possibility of deserving well of the crown&#146;, though he admitted that, because of ill health, he would not live to enjoy such royal grace  (Gilbert, 3.xlvii). His pessimism was justified and he died within the following five months.<br>
<br>O'Neill is mainly remembered for his defence of Clonmel and Limerick. While he was, doubtless, a competent practitioner of siege warfare, his reputation was inflated by the amateurish siege tactics of Cromwell and Ireton.<br>
