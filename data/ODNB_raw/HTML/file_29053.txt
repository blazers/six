<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Wentworth  (1501&#150;1551), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born at Nettlestead in Suffolk, the eldest son of Sir Richard Wentworth, <i>de jure</i> fifth Baron Le Despenser (<i>d</i>. 1528), and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27952/', "Sir James Tyrell")</script> of Gipping, Suffolk, the alleged murderer of the princes in the Tower who was executed in 1502. Originally from Yorkshire, Thomas's family had settled in Suffolk in the mid-fifteenth century. Through his father he was a cousin of Queen Jane Seymour and her brother Edward, later duke of Somerset. About 1520 he married Margaret, elder daughter of Sir Adrian Fortescue and his first wife, Anne Stonor (<i>d</i>. 1518), with whom he had a large family, which numbered at least eight sons and nine daughters. The eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29054/', "Thomas Wentworth, second Baron Wentworth and de jure seventh Baron Le Despenser")</script>. The youngest known daughter, Dorothy, married, second, the privateer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10191/', "Martin Frobisher")</script>.<br>
<br>The young Thomas Wentworth participated in the invasion of France in 1523, during which he was knighted by the duke of Suffolk (notwithstanding his associations with the Brandons, he should not be confused with Suffolk's vice-chamberlain, Thomas Wentworth of West Bretton). Wentworth's elevation to the nobility, in 1529, was probably unexpected. For the parliament of 1529 he was elected a knight of the shire for Suffolk, but on 2 December 1529 he joined three other MPs among a group of seven new barons created by Henry VIII, probably in part to bolster lay membership of the Lords in advance of attacks upon the church.<br>
<br>As a peer Wentworth participated in the trials of Queen Anne and Lord Rochford in May 1536, and in those of Baron Montague and the marquess of Exeter in 1538. In 1539 he was absent from the session at which his own father-in-law, Sir Adrian Fortescue, was attainted for treason, but the act of attainder none the less included a clause safeguarding the interests of Wentworth and his wife. Wentworth's family woes continued in 1540, with the death of his wife's sister Frances, Lady Fitzgerald (whose husband had been executed in 1537). As Lady Fitzgerald died while in Wentworth's custody and his wife stood to inherit her estate, he begged Thomas Cromwell to conduct an investigation to dispel rumours of murder.<br>
<br>Outside parliament, Lord Wentworth served the crown faithfully at home and abroad. At court he assisted at the baptism of Prince Edward (whose kinsman he was) on 15 October 1537. As well as a Suffolk JP (from 1531), he was regularly nominated to special commissions in the county, where he was the leading resident nobleman, and where he sometimes showed a domineering temperament in disputes with relations and neighbours. In 1545 he was an oyer and terminer commissioner (eastern circuit), as well as a commissioner to levy the benevolence in Suffolk. In the summer of 1543 Wentworth supplied fifty men for service in Flanders, and the following year he served under the duke of Norfolk at the unsuccessful English siege of Montreuil. He also headed the county musters commissioners.<br>
<br>During the 1530s Wentworth actively advanced the cause of religious reform around Ipswich. He energetically investigated Suffolk clergy accused of preaching the papal supremacy, and assisted Archbishop Cranmer in pursuing Hugh Payne, a conservative preacher once curate at Hadleigh. In April 1538 he arranged the removal to London of an image of the Virgin at Ipswich, and that same month claimed possession (as a descendant of the founder) of the Ipswich Greyfriars, denouncing its residents as &#145;an idell neste of dranes&#146;  (Miller, 241). Wentworth was also a zealous promoter of local evangelicals. He intervened with Cromwell on behalf of an Essex man accused of heresy, and in 1538 he appointed the reformer Thomas Becon (who had ties to Nettlestead) to an Ipswich chantry. Most notably, the evangelical writer John Bale, previously prior of the Ipswich Carmelites, credited Wentworth personally with converting him to the reformers' cause. For Wentworth, as a leading figure in Suffolk, the conservative reaction that followed the fall of Cromwell presented difficult dilemmas, as in 1545 when he presided over the Ipswich trial of two men accused of denying transubstantiation. One of the prisoners, John Kirby, publicly accused Wentworth of acting against his conscience in condemning him; the clearly uncomfortable judge could only blush and stammer a lame reply. According to Foxe, during the subsequent executions in Ipswich market place, Wentworth &#145;did shroud himself behind one of the posts of the gallery, and wept&#146;  (Townsend, 5.532). Despite such damaging incidents, Wentworth retained his reputation as being sympathetic to reformers. With the accession of Edward VI the religious climate changed once more, and evangelical works appeared from the presses with Wentworth's support: Richard Argentine dedicated his translation of one of Luther's sermons (printed at Ipswich in 1549) to his former patron, while in the preface to his 1550 edition of the German Lutheran Johann Brenz, Richard Sherry praised Wentworth as a favourer of the scriptures.<br>
<br>Under his cousin Lord Protector Somerset, Wentworth (who had had a grant under Henry VIII's &#145;unwritten will&#146;) was admitted to the privy council, apparently as early as August 1547. As a councillor resident in East Anglia, he played a leading part in pacifying the Suffolk rebels in July 1549, and immediately afterwards in Northampton's disastrous attack on Norwich. Following these troubles, Wentworth profited from Warwick's council coup against the protector. In October 1549 he was named one of six noblemen to attend upon the king in his privy chamber, and on 2 February 1550 he replaced the Catholic Lord Arundel as lord chamberlain of the household. In the previous month he had showed his support for Warwick, who shared his evangelical views, by taking part in the interrogation of Sir Thomas Arundell, a Catholic supporter of Somerset.<br>
<br>In addition to his principal seat at Nettlestead, Wentworth inherited five manors in Suffolk and five in Yorkshire, to which were added lands in Lincolnshire and elsewhere. In 1538 he acquired the Ipswich Greyfriars (although his legal title remained contested), and three years later he and his wife secured some Stonor properties. With the plunder of the bishops' estates by Warwick's regime, in 1550 Wentworth obtained Cheyneygates (the former residence of the abbot of Westminster), together with the Middlesex manors of Hackney and Stepney.<br>
<br>Lord Wentworth last attended the privy council on 14 February 1551, and died on 3 March following. His funeral at Westminster Abbey four days later was a lavish state occasion, and included a sermon preached by the royal chaplain Miles Coverdale, as befitted a prominent protestant nobleman. He was buried in the chapel of St John, but has no memorial. His wife briefly survived him. Wentworth's will, drawn up in 1544, was proved on 27 November 1551 by his son Thomas, who succeeded to the title.<br>
