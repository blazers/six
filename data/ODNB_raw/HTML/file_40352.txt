</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Munro,  Robert</span>, Baron Alness  (1868&#150;1955), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 28 May 1868 at Alness, Ross-shire, the eldest son of Alexander Rose Munro (1835&#150;1903), Free Church minister, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1920), daughter of John Sinclair, minister of Bruan, Caithness. He was educated privately and then at Aberdeen grammar school. In 1889 he graduated MA from the University of Edinburgh and in 1892 took an LLB. Munro was president of the Students' Representative Council and of the University Liberal Association.<br>
<br>On leaving university Munro became official receiver in bankruptcy under the Board of Trade in London, which gave him an awareness of commercial law. He was called to the Scottish bar on 3 November 1893. On 8 September 1898 he married Edith Gwladys Evans (1875&#150;1920), only daughter of the Revd J. Llewellyn Evans of Peebles.<br>
<br>As an advocate Munro's practice was successful without being extensive. He appeared for the United Free Church as junior counsel in the litigation over property arising from the church union of 1900 and undertook work for the Inland Revenue. In 1907 he was appointed counsel to the Inland Revenue, in 1908 advocate depute, and in 1910 king's counsel.<br>
<br>Munro continued to be politically active after university, assisting the Liberals at by-elections. He was himself unexpectedly elected for Wick Burghs at the general election of January 1910, an event that he later said caused him considerable personal and professional embarrassment. In October 1913 he was appointed lord advocate, a position he held until December 1916 when, choosing to follow Lloyd George when the Liberal Party split, he became secretary for Scotland. In December 1913 he was appointed a privy councillor.<br>
<br>Munro was one of the longer serving secretaries for Scotland, holding the post until his resignation in October 1922. His tenure has attracted adverse comment because of his involvement in combating wartime industrial unrest on Clydeside. As lord advocate, in December 1915 he supported in principle, but expressed doubts about the success of, bringing a prosecution against the authors of a Clyde Workers' Committee leaflet opposing the provisions of the <span class="roman">Munitions Act</span>. He was involved in the temporary suppression of the socialist newspaper <span class="italic">Forward</span>. This had reported on an unsuccessful rally at which Lloyd George tried to address munitions workers in Glasgow in December 1915, one of a series of reports which ministers again felt were detrimental to enforcing the <span class="roman">Munitions Act</span>. As Scottish secretary, Munro was responsible in August 1917 for getting the war cabinet's agreement to banning a meeting of the Central Workers' and Soldiers' Committee for Glasgow. This was part of the response in the city to the Russian Revolution. Munro believed that the forty hours' strike of January&#150;February 1919, aimed at achieving the reduction of the working week, was, though limited in scale, a Bolshevik uprising. He also initially held that special constables should be used to protect public utilities, as they were more reliable than soldiers, but was eventually involved in the government's decision to send troops and a few tanks to Glasgow. Finally, Munro was involved in the various terms of imprisonment of the socialist leader John MacLean. During MacLean's release from prison in 1917&#150;18, for instance, Munro defended this step before the cabinet on the grounds of MacLean's unstable physical and mental health and the resultant calls for his release.<br>
<br>It is easy to see the mixture of timidity and unimaginative overreaction in Munro's role as secretary for Scotland in these events. He has, as a result, been described as &#145;the dim representative of a failing political party&#146;  (Harvie, 28). In mitigation of this judgement can only be set the fact that much of what occurred took place in wartime and during fears of the spread of revolution. Munro's position outside the war cabinet, which was taking the decisions, did not assist him.<br>
<br>At the general election of December 1918 Munro was returned as a Coalition Liberal for Roxburgh and Selkirk, as his Wick Burghs seat had ceased to exist as a result of redistribution. He entered Lloyd George's coalition cabinet in 1919. In September 1920 Edith, Munro's first wife, died. He married again, on 29 October 1921, Olga Marie Grumler (1897&#150;1981), only daughter of J. G. Grumler, of Dinard, France, and Harrogate.<br>
<br>Two important Scottish measures were passed during Munro's time as secretary for Scotland. First, the <span class="roman">Scottish Education Act</span> of 1918 incorporated Munro's suggestion that denominational, mainly Roman Catholic, schools in Scotland should be transferred to the new local education authorities which the act set up. These authorities, however, only lasted until they were abolished and their functions absorbed by new, larger unitary authorities under the <span class="roman">Local Government (Scotland) Act</span> of 1929. Also the act's aims of raising the school leaving age to fifteen, and of developing vocational and further education, were not realized in the years immediately following its passage. Second, the <span class="roman">Church of Scotland Act</span> of 1921 allowed the church on its own, without parliamentary action, to adopt articles of a constitution. This helped to clear the way for union with the United Free Church in 1929.<br>
<br>Munro saw the time during which he was secretary for Scotland as a dark and critical period. He criticized the low status of the position, which nevertheless meant that the incumbent had &#145;to think of Upper Silesia as well as, let us say, Auchtermuchty&#146;  (Munro, 282). He supported the improved status it received when the position of secretary of state for Scotland was created in 1926.<br>
<br>Munro resigned political office in October 1922, when he accepted an appointment as lord justice clerk and president of the second division of the court of session. He took the judicial title of Lord Alness. Ill health forced his retirement from this position in October 1933, but his recovery allowed him to accept a barony in June 1934, again with the title of Lord Alness. He moved to London and was pleased to begin a new parliamentary career. Keeping away from party concerns, he assisted the House of Lords appeal committee, continued to sit on the judicial committee of the privy council, and also participated in legislative work. Alness introduced a reform of the divorce law in Scotland, which was enacted in 1938. This established new grounds for divorce and shortened the period necessary to establish legal desertion. During the 1930s Alness also accepted an increasing number of appointments to various committees. These included, in 1930, the chairmanship of the joint exchequer board under the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span>, the chairmanship of the Chinese bond-holders' committee, set up by the Bank of England in 1935, and the presidency of government committees on night baking and nursing in 1936 and 1937. He was also chairman of a House of Lords select committee into road accident prevention, of the University Grants Committee for Scotland, and of the executive committee of the Child Guidance Council and of the National Council for Mental Hygiene.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war finally concluded Alness's judicial career. He was appointed a lord-in-waiting in May 1940 to enable him to take charge of government legislation in the House of Lords, a position he held until July 1945. Additionally, he was chairman of the Scottish War Savings Committee from 1941 until 1945 and, as a former secretary for Scotland, a member of secretary of state Tom Johnston's advisory wartime council of state. He was also chairman of an advisory committee appointed to look into the cases of people interned in Scotland.<br>
<br>Alness also held posts in a number of voluntary organizations. These included the presidency of the Association of Scottish Societies, which involved him in all forms of social and benevolent activity in wartime London, as well as a trusteeship of the Carnegie Trust and the vice-presidency of the Building Societies Association.<br>
<br>For his public services Alness was appointed GBE in 1946. He held LLDs from the universities of Edinburgh (1919), Aberdeen (1921), and St Andrews (1935), and was an honorary bencher of Lincoln's Inn. In addition to being made a deputy lieutenant of Edinburgh in 1929, he was a freeman of the city, and also of Dingwall and Peebles. Alness published in 1930 a collection of writings, <span class="italic">Looking Back: Fugitive Writings and Sayings</span>. In later life he made his home in Bournemouth, where he died at the Durley Dean Hotel Nursing Home on 6 October 1955. He was cremated at the north cemetery, Bournemouth, on 10 October 1955.<br>
