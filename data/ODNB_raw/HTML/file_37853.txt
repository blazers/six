<span class="headword">Phillips,  Peregrine</span>  (1800&#150;1888), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer and inventor</span>, was born in Philadelphia Street, Bristol, on 30 January 1800, the fourth of six children of Peregrine Phillips senior (1764&#150;1833), a tailor at 24 Philadelphia Street and then at 34 Milk Street, Bristol, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox. Phillips senior, the son of a butcher of the same name and Martha Owen of Haverfordwest, was descended from the puritan preacher Peregrine Phillips (1623&#150;1691), and was a deacon at the Broadmead Baptist Church in Bristol. In 1824 Phillips senior started a vinegar-making business with a John Thorne at 48 Thomas Street, Bristol.<br>
<br>Phillips married Susannah Chapman (1806&#150;1850), daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Chapman, on 18 November 1826 at St Mary's Church in Islington. He probably joined his father's vinegar-making partnership around the same time, as his first child, Elizabeth, was born at Thomas Street, Bristol, in 1827.<br>
<br>In 1831 Phillips junior took out a patent (no. 6096) for the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the contact process. The manufacture of sulphuric acid had become an increasingly industrialized process over the previous century due to improvements made by Joshua Ward from 1736, and the lead chamber process developed by John Roebuck from 1749. However, their processes relied on the combustion of saltpetre and sulphur, while Phillips's method saved on saltpetre by directly passing sulphur dioxide and oxygen through a platinum catalyst. By then passing the resultant sulphur trioxide through towers of moistened pebbles, the process produced a more concentrated sulphuric acid.<br>
<br>Phillips did not remain in Bristol to exploit his invention. In the months between starting the patent application process in March and receiving the patent in September, he left his father's vinegar-making partnership in June 1831. The reasons for his departure are unclear, but in the same year he and his family crossed the Atlantic from Bristol on the <i>Cosmo</i>, under Captain John Gillespie. They landed at New York, before eventually settling across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, in Campbell county, Kentucky. Phillips senior's business at Thomas Street lasted only another year before the plant and stock were sold by auction in October 1832.<br>
<br>In 1837 Phillips took out another patent (US no. 160), for the manufacture of white lead, and by 1839 had set up a white lead manufactory on Plum Street, between 2nd and 3rd streets, in Cincinnati, Ohio. His involvement in this venture was apparently short-lived, as the factory was in the hands of Townsend, Hills &amp; Co. by at least as early as 1842. Little is known about Phillips's activities in the 1840s, but a P. Phillips was appointed a judge of lamps, candles, and soaps at the 1842 fair of the Ohio Mechanics' Institute, alongside the pharmaceutical manufacturer William S. Merrell.<br>
<br>By 1850 Phillips had returned to Campbell county, where he was a farmer. Either he or his son of the same name was a justice of the peace in northern Kentucky in 1869. By 1870 he had retired, living with his son Alfred and some of his grandchildren in the tiny village of Buena Vista in Harrison county, Kentucky. Peregrine and Susannah Phillips had nine children: Elizabeth, Peregrine, and Susannah were born in Bristol; Alfred Chapman and Mary Bullmer were born in Kentucky; and Robert Allen, Richard Sidney, Emaline, and George Cox were born in Ohio. Phillips died in Cynthiana, Harrison county, Kentucky, on 6 March 1888, and was buried at Evergreen cemetery, in Campbell county, Kentucky.<br>
<br>It was not until the 1870s that the contact process for manufacturing sulphuric acid began to be exploited on an industrial scale, by Rudolf Messel in London and Clemens Alexander Winkler in Freiburg. It eventually proved to be of major significance for a variety of industries, with concentrated sulphuric acid being used in particular to produce artificial fertilizers.<br>
