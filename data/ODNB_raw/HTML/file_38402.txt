<span class="headword">Jennings,  James</span>  (1772&#150;1833), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Huntspill, Somerset, on 1 December 1772, the second son of John Jennings (1736&#150;1805), who kept the village shop, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fear (1741?&#150;1806). He attended Mary Ramsey's village school and then North Petherton School near Bridgwater until 1785. In 1786 he was apprenticed to a Bristol apothecary, and in the course of the next few years came to know some of the radical authors who settled in that city, notably the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. He had poems published in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, and in 1794 wrote a satire, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which was conspicuously unsuccessful. In 1795 he married Charlotte Sawier, and shortly afterwards moved to work in London. Conditions there affected their health; Charlotte's first child was born prematurely, and she herself was so ill that she never fully recovered. In 1801 they returned to Huntspill and the family business. Charlotte was particularly active in helping the poor of the parish, and when she died, in April 1807, Jennings wrote an eloquent account of her good works which was published in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, to which thereafter he was a fairly frequent contributor.<br>
<br>In December 1807 Jennings married Sarah Rouquet (<i>d</i>. 1830). His philanthropic concerns continued, and in 1813 he and the local rector established a village school conducted on the monitorial system popularized by Joseph Lancaster and Andrew Bell. But soon afterwards, the onset of the British economic depression at the end of the Napoleonic wars forced him to abandon his shop, and in the summer of 1817 he settled in London. He supported himself as a professional writer, with some patronage from a wealthy banker, Sir William Paxton, to whom he seems to have been introduced by the republican artist George Cumberland. In 1821 Jennings published <span class="italic">The Family Cyclopaedia</span>. It placed a special emphasis on recent inventions and improvements, and he was always an enthusiastic champion of the &#145;march of intellect&#146;. When the Surrey Institution, scene of lectures by Coleridge and Hazlitt, had to close in 1823, he set up a successor, the Metropolitan Literary Institution. It did not succeed, however, and Jennings's last years were confined to authorship. He was something of an ornithologist, and published a verse treatise on the subject in 1828. His most successful venture was <span class="italic">Observations on some of the Dialects of the West of England</span> (1825), which included some pleasant poems illustrating the speech patterns of his own part of Somerset. He died in Greenwich on 8 October 1833.<br>
