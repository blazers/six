<span class="headword">Backhouse,  John</span>  (1784&#150;1845), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 14 October 1784 at Wavertree, Lancashire, the son of John Backhouse, a Liverpool merchant. He was educated at the Carmel School, Westmorland, and the foundation school, Clitheroe, Lancashire. After becoming a partner in his father's business, he was sent in 1812 to be secretary of the firm's office in London. There his talents were soon recognized by George Canning, MP for Liverpool, who employed Backhouse as his private secretary, first at the Board of Control from 1816 and subsequently at the Foreign Office, first as private secretary and then as under-secretary while Canning was foreign secretary from September 1822 to January 1823. When Canning moved to the Foreign Office, he asked the prime minister to find Backhouse a vacancy which would pay &pound;1000 a year and be &#145;not liable to the vicissitudes of ministerial arrangements&#146;  (Middleton, <span class="italic">Administration</span>, 128). This was achieved by his appointment as a commissioner of excise (January 1823&#150;April 1827). When in April 1827 Backhouse succeeded Joseph Planta, who had been under-secretary at the Foreign Office since 1817, he was appointed to the office of receiver-general of excise, as his previous office as a commissioner was incompatible with the office of under-secretary. He received &pound;1500 per annum from this office and &pound;500 from the Foreign Office. After Canning's death Backhouse was not asked to resign, and by continuing to hold office irrespective of a change in ministry his subsequent career helped to define the position of the permanent under-secretary as the head of the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>From its inception in 1782 the Foreign Office had two under-secretaries by virtue of the amalgamation of the northern and southern departments. Both under-secretaries were political appointments, with equal rank and salary, and they shared equally the political business of the office along the lines of the old north&#150;south division. The senior of the under-secretaries by virtue of experience came to be associated with questions relating to Turkey, Russia, and France, which were considered to be of enduring interest. By 1840 Backhouse had assumed responsibility for managing affairs relating to all the great foreign powers. He was also responsible for the personnel and administration of the Foreign Office and the management of the secret service fund. Palmerston described his two under-secretaries as being &#145;like the two figures in the weather house who rusticate and labour alternately&#146;  (Bourne, 417), but under Palmerston, Backhouse seems to have laboured more than he rusticated. A kindly, well-meaning man, he was overworked and overawed by Palmerston; in consequence his health was ruined and a mental collapse led to his retirement in April 1842.<br>
<br>Backhouse married in 1810 Catherine Nicholson of Stockport. They had four daughters and two sons, one of whom&#151;George Canning Backhouse&#151;was murdered in Havana on 31 August 1855 while on foreign service. Backhouse was a close friend of the publisher John Murray. He regularly contributed articles to popular periodicals and edited one book, the <span class="italic">Narrative of the American sailor Robert Adams' residence in the interior of Africa at Timbuctoo</span>. He died on 13 November 1845 at his residence in Hans Place, Chelsea, and was buried seven days later in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
