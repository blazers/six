<span class="headword">Ravenser,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1386), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was one of a large family clan of royal servants who came from the parts of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on either side of the Humber; its members included John Thoresby, archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1373), and John Waltham, bishop of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1395). Waltham was Thoresby's great-nephew, while Ravenser and Waltham's father were cousins. In 1343 Ravenser was attorney to Queen Philippa (<i>d</i>. 1369), and by October 1353 was described as a chancery clerk. He was keeper of the hanaper of chancery, an office to which he was appointed on 1 September 1357, and which he had vacated by 11 July 1359, and in 1363 he was promoted to the rank of greater clerk of chancery. Twice he was one of a commission who took charge of the great seal: in 1372 when the chancellor, Sir Robert Thorpe, was dying, and in 1377, during the last days of Edward III. Concurrently with his chancery duties he served three royal ladies: Queen Philippa, for whom he was attorney, receiver of rents and debts, and, from 1362 to 1367, treasurer; the queen mother, Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1358), for whom he performed similar duties and administered her goods after her death; and Princess Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1379), whose employment he had entered by 1364. In 1370 he founded a chantry at Beverley for the souls of Queen Isabella and Queen Philippa. Ravenser continued in chancery service until at least December 1384, and died between 17 May and 1 June 1386. He was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Ravenser's secular career was rewarded by ecclesiastical preferment; after 1349, when he was granted Anderby rectory, Lincolnshire, royal patronage brought him a succession of presentations. But he exchanged most of his benefices, showing a preference for those in Lincolnshire and south Yorkshire, an area to which he remained attached; he founded a hospital in Beverley, as well as a chantry there, three chantries in Lincolnshire, and, with relatives, gave generously to churches in Beverley and Hull. Notable appointments included the provostship of Beverley (1360&#150;68) and the archdeaconry of Lincoln (from 1368 until his death). Ravenser was involved in controversy at both places. He inherited a claim, advanced by the previous holder, to exceptional powers of jurisdiction in the archdeaconry of Lincoln, and on appeal secured a ruling very favourable (though personal) to himself; one of the appeal judges was the previous archdeacon, William Wykeham (<i>d</i>. 1404). At Beverley he led the resistance to Archbishop Alexander Neville's proposed visitation in 1381, giving shelter at Lincoln to other rebels. For this Neville deprived him of his prebends in Beverley (St Martin's, from 1363) and York Minster (Knaresborough, from 1371). Though it cannot be computed with any accuracy Ravenser's wealth was considerable at the time of his death, and he maintained homes in Yorkshire, Lincoln, and London.<br>
