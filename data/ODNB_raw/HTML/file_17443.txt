<span class="headword">MacDonald,  John</span>  (1818&#150;1889), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Aberdeen</span>, was born in Ballicladich, Strathglass, Inverness-shire, on 2 July 1818, the son of William MacDonald and his wife, Hannah Fraser, both Catholics. He was educated locally, and later by the Benedictines at the Scottish seminary, St James's, Regensburg, in Bavaria (1830&#150;37). He entered the Scots College, Rome, in June 1837. In ill health and accompanied by Bishop James Kyle, vicar apostolic of the northern district, he returned to Scotland as subdeacon in June 1840. In the following year, after attending Blairs College, he was ordained at Preshome by Bishop Kyle. He then served in the following missions: as assistant at Tombae, Banffshire (December 1841 &#150; February 1842); alone at Glenmoriston, Inverness-shire, with Dornie Kintail, Ross-shire, as well for about a year (February 1842 &#150; May 1844); Braemar, Aberdeenshire (May 1844&#150;May 1845); as assistant at Inverness (May 1845 &#150; May 1846) and later as sole priest (1846&#150;8); Fassnakyle, Upper Strathglass, (1848&#150;56); and Eskadale, Lower Strathglass (1856&#150;68). At Eskadale he was chaplain to Simon Fraser, thirteenth Lord Lovat.<br>
<br>MacDonald was chosen as coadjutor by Kyle, and accepted in Rome, with the title of bishop of Nicopolis, on 11 December 1868. The appointment of a Scot, amid the bitter Irish-Scottish Catholic internecine feuding, was a relief to Kyle and the other Scottish bishops. Unfortunately Kyle died the previous day and so MacDonald immediately became vicar apostolic. As he was only the second bishop consecrated in Aberdeen since the Reformation, his installation aroused considerable public interest: the ceremony took place at St Mary's Aberdeen, and the Irish-born bishop John Lynch of the western district was not invited.<br>
<br>In 1869&#150;70 MacDonald attended the First Vatican Council in Rome. On the restoration of the Scottish hierarchy in 1878 he was translated to the diocese of Aberdeen. During his episcopacy, Rome restored Wick and Caithness as well as Orkney and Shetland, some 262 miles distant, to his diocese (in 1860 they had been taken from Scottish episcopal jurisdiction and placed under the Arctic mission). Kincardine and part of Inverness-shire were also added to the former north district vicariate territory to make his new diocese. After an initial residence in Eskadale, he settled in Aberdeen in February 1869, making St Mary's Aberdeen his cathedral from 1886.<br>
<br>Reputedly the tallest man at the Vatican Council, MacDonald was a handsome and imposing figure, but possessed a shy, retiring, and diffident character. He was very conscientious in his religious duties but played very little part in public affairs. In 1868 his appointment represented a return to quiet competence; less assertive than Kyle, he was also unlike the enthusiastic and zealous Archbishop Gillis of Edinburgh or the tempestuous Bishop Lynch of Glasgow.<br>
<br>MacDonald presided over a vast area, with only about 11,000 faithful, the vast majority of them poor, with hardly half a dozen considerable families of substance. During his episcopate, however, solid progress was made: the number of churches, chapels, and stations more than doubled to 88; the number of clergy grew from 35 to 53 priests; religious orders of women in the diocese increased more than threefold; and the number of convents more than quadrupled. He also encouraged Lord Lovat's foundation of the Benedictine abbey at Fort Augustus, and orphanages, homes for the elderly, and education received his attention. All this was accomplished without debts, or political or sectarian disturbance: his was a safe pair of hands. From 1875 MacDonald suffered increasingly from ill health; he deteriorated rapidly in late 1888 and died on 4 February 1889 at 20 Queen's Road, Aberdeen. He was buried in St Mary's Cathedral, Aberdeen.<br>
