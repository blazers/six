<span class="headword">Evans,  (David) Caradoc</span>  (1878&#150;1945), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 31 December 1878 at Pant-y-croi, Llanfihangel-ar-arth, Carmarthenshire, the fourth of the five children of William Evans (1849&#150;1882), auctioneer, and his wife, Mary (1848&#150;1934), daughter of William Powell and his wife, Mary. His childhood was spent at Rhydlewis, Cardiganshire, where his widowed mother worked a 9 acre smallholding. Forced to leave the Rhydlewis board school at fourteen, Evans became an apprentice draper, suffering the tyranny of &#145;living in&#146; at various south Wales and London stores. He read Robert Blatchford's socialist <span class="italic">Clarion</span> and the French and Russian short-story writers, and, following evening classes at the Working Men's College, took his chance in Fleet Street.<br>
<br>By 1915 Evans had become editor of <span class="italic">Ideas</span> (a Hulton's popular weekly) and had begun to publish the stories that would make his literary reputation. <span class="italic">My People</span> (1915) debunked the myth of rural Wales: Evans's Manteg (a fictionalized Rhydlewis) is a place of greed and violence, of patriarchal repression and chapel terrorism, all beneath the veneer of religion. Visceral Welsh antagonism countered London critical praise. Sermons were preached against him, his East Sheen windows stoned, and efforts made to suppress his book. <span class="italic">Capel Sion</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">My Neighbours</span> (1920) followed, the latter exploiting comic fantasy in its satire on the London Welsh&#151;who in turn responded by wrecking a 1925 performance of <span class="italic">Taffy</span>, Evans's only play.<br>
<br>Evans published little in the 1920s outside assaults on Liberal nonconformity, judged a politically repressive force, stifling the intellect and imagination. As a journalist he prospered, first with the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> (1917&#150;23), then as acting editor of <span class="italic">T.P.'s Weekly</span> (1923&#150;9), a middlebrow literary journal. An acquaintance described him at this time, his:<blockquote>hollow strong face, the mouth large, the eyes small and piercing, beneath a black felt hat, of which the turned-down brim keeps even the high cheek-bones of the creature in shadow. The speech is swift, hissing; the views it conveys invariably violent and violently phrased. (Blake, 61)</blockquote>It was the violence of protest; his kindness and courtesy were manifest.<span class="italic">Nothing to Pay</span> (1930), Evans's fine first novel, is a Swiftian fable of money worship in the underworld of drapery. His pleasure at its reception&#151;H. G. Wells thought it &#145;true in all substantial particulars&#146;  (Wells, 147)&#151;hid an inner turmoil. He had lost his job when <span class="italic">T.P.'s Weekly</span> folded and was involved with Marguerite Barczinsky [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59377/', "Evans, Marguerite Florence Laura (1886/&#150;1964)")</script>], a best-selling novelist under the pseudonyms Countess Barcynska and Oliver Sandys, who urged that he abandon Fleet Street to become a full-time writer. With her he left London and his wife, Rose Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sewell (<i>b</i>. 1876), the Lambeth jobmaster's daughter he had married on 25 December 1907.<br>
<br>At first the move seemed justified. Remarried on 22 March 1933 and settled at Aberystwyth, Evans published two more novels: the moderately successful <span class="italic">Wasps</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">This Way to Heaven</span> (1934), a critical disaster. Again his writing dried up, though controversy still clung around &#145;the best-hated man in Wales&#146;  (Stokes, 135): his portrait, by Evan Walters, was refused a Welsh showing (and knife-slashed across the throat while on display in London), and his draft for a broadcast talk rejected by the BBC in Wales. Yet the excellence of Evans's writing and his courage as dissident won the admiration of Dylan Thomas and other English-language writers in Wales, for whom he became the founding father of a new &#145;Anglo-Welsh&#146; literature.<br>
<br>&#145;I like stories that are gloomy, morose and bitter&#146;, said Evans, explaining his lifelong obsessions; &#145;an angry man is nearer himself than a happy man&#146;  (Evans, <span class="italic">Fury Never Leaves Us</span>, 131). None the less his later stories show a broadening of vision: <span class="italic">Pilgrims in a Foreign Land</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">The Earth Gives All and Takes All</span> (1946) move into fantasy and folk tale through a more consciously poetic idiom. Caradoc Evans died of heart failure at Aberystwyth and Cardiganshire General Hospital on 11 January 1945, and was buried on 16 January at Horeb Chapel, next to Brynawelon (&#145;hill of breezes&#146;), the Evans' home at New Cross. During the second half of the twentieth century his critical reputation in Wales improved, and few serious critics would now react to his depiction of Welsh life with the ferocity of his original commentators.<br>
