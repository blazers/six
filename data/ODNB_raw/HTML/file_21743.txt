<span class="headword">Peckham, Sir  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1608), <span class="occ">colonial adventurer</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21742/', "Sir Edmund Peckham (d. 1564)")</script> of Denham, Buckinghamshire, former high treasurer of the mint, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1570), daughter of John Cheyne of Chesham Bois. In 1554 he married Susan, daughter and heir of Henry Webbe; she died in childbirth, aged seventeen, on 11 December 1555. He had with his second wife two sons, Edmund and George. His Roman Catholic faith was not an impediment to early advancement. Knighted in 1570, he was sheriff of Buckinghamshire from 1572, and several orders in council relate to the duties he discharged in that office. The circumstances by which he came to be interested in colonial projects are obscure, but his name appeared with those of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Sir Richard Grenville, Christopher Carleill, and eighteen others in a &#145;supplication of certen gentlemen in the west partes for a newe navigacon&#146; of March 1574  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/95, 63). Although it was Gilbert alone who in 1578 received letters patent &#145;to discover, settle and exploit such remote heathen and barbarous landes countries and territories not actually possessed of any Christian prince&#146;, Peckham was one of the adventurers who financed his first attempt to found an English colony in North America. He saw a potential solution to the plight of English Catholics in the establishment of settlements which, while remaining loyal to the English crown, would be sufficiently remote to avoid the crippling financial penalties imposed upon recusants. Gilbert's voyage of 1578 was entirely unsuccessful, although neither he nor Peckham was discouraged. But Peckham was diverted from the project for a time by his imprisonment in 1580 for harbouring Catholic priests.<br>
<br>Released in March 1581, Peckham immediately busied himself in assisting the preparations for Gilbert's second expedition, for which he secured the advice of the noted polymath John Dee and the colonial propagandist Richard Hakluyt. In April 1582 it was rumoured that he intended to sail in the voyage. In fact, as preparations proceeded, it was agreed that the Catholic group of investors, led by Peckham and Sir William Gerrard, would set out on their own expedition to claim and independently settle some 8.5 million acres of land assigned to them by Gilbert, half of which represented Peckham's personal investment. In June 1582 articles of intent regarding their expedition were drafted, for which Martin Frobisher and Sir Richard Bingham were named as potential commanders. The project was sufficiently attractive to interest a number of non-Catholic subscribers. In June 1583 Sir Philip Sidney, who had acquired from Gilbert assignments of 3 million acres on his own behalf, joined these to Peckham's.<br>
<br>Gilbert's death at sea in September 1583 was a severe blow to the Western planting movement. Furthermore, the Spanish crown and a number of powerful English Catholic exiles appear to have put pressure upon Peckham and others to abandon the project entirely: the former because it implicitly violated Spain's claims of exploitation of the New World, the latter because large-scale Catholic emigration from England would have represented <i>de facto</i> recognition of the <span class="roman">Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity</span>. Lacking Gilbert's reputation, Peckham had difficulty in securing further investment, though Sir Francis Walsingham assisted with a letter of recommendation. In a bid to spur interest in the project, Peckham published his <span class="italic">True reporte, of the late discoveries &hellip; by that valiant and worthy gentleman, Sir Humfrey Gilbert</span> on 12 November 1583. Dedicated to Walsingham, it presented the arguments in favour of the project: in effect, presenting the voice of Gilbert from beyond the grave. It provided justifications for intercourse with &#145;savages&#146; and justified the queen's right of title over them, examined the benefits arising to England from the establishment of colonies, and confirmed the vast profits to be had by any who might invest therein, concluding: &#145;Let us therefore with cheerefull mindes and couragious hearts, give the attempt, and leave the sequell to almightye God&#146;  (Hakluyt, 8.89&#150;131).<br>
<br>Though a cogent plea for funds, the <span class="italic">True Reporte</span> failed to excite sufficient interest, and once the queen had forbidden Sidney to sail upon the intended expedition its abandonment was inevitable, leaving future initiatives on American colonization to Adrian Gilbert and Walter Ralegh, who inherited Sir Humphrey's patent rights. Soon afterwards, in 1584, Peckham was in prison once more for some offence relating to his Catholicism. From a financial perspective he appears to have suffered severely from his commitment to the project, and from the penalties incurred by his continuing religious nonconformity. In 1595 at least part of his Denham estate was surrendered to the crown to meet his debts, but he retained possession of unspecified properties there. There is little information on his latter years. He died before 21 June 1608, probably in modest circumstances.<br>
<br>Although his career was marked by the failure of English Western planting, Peckham is regarded as one of the most active, if not innovative, proponents of Elizabethan expansionism. His <span class="italic">True Reporte</span> was the first published work specifically to address the prospects for, and requirements of, English colonies in the New World. He was survived by his son George, who co-invested with his father in Gilbert's scheme.<br>
