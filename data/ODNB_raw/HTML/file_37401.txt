<span class="headword">Evelyn, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1591, <em>d.</em> 1663/4), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 20 October 1591 in Kingston, Surrey, the second son of John Evelyn (<i>d</i>. 1627), manufacturer, of Godstone in the same county, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heir of William Stephens of Kingston. The family fortune had been established by Evelyn's grandfather, who had acquired the monopoly of making gunpowder under the Tudors.<br>
<br>Evelyn matriculated as a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1606 and entered the Middle Temple in 1610. On 24 November 1618 he married Thomazine, daughter of William Heynes of Chessington, Surrey, and soon after built a large family house at Godstone at the alleged cost of &pound;9000. He succeeded to his father's business in 1627, by which time the gunpowder monopoly was under attack and the business itself in financial difficulty. In an attempt to defend his position Evelyn secured election to parliament for Bletchingley, Surrey, the following year and immediately introduced a bill, which was lost in committee, for the easier supply of saltpetre. After finally losing the contract to supply gunpowder in 1636, he petitioned for compensation for losses but it was several years before he was cleared of all responsibility for the failure to maintain supplies.<br>
<br>In 1640 Evelyn was re-elected to the Long Parliament in which his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52646/', "Sir John Evelyn (1601&#150;1685)")</script> of Wiltshire, sat for Ludgershall; he was &#145;galled&#146; at the attacks on the family's monopoly. He was knighted in June 1641, and as late as December he urged consultation with the king over suppression of the Irish rising. A reluctant supporter of parliament after the outbreak of civil war, Evelyn was only persuaded to subscribe the oath of loyalty to Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, on threat of imprisonment. With the failure of peace moves Evelyn's allegiance to parliament faltered in August 1643: he retired to Godstone but came under suspicion following the interception of a letter which seemed to suggest that he and his nephew were preparing to make their peace with the king. When interrogated by a Commons committee he failed to answer questions &#145;clearly and ingenuously&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1640&#150;60</span>) and was suspended from the house for over a year.<br>
<br>Evelyn's subsequent political actions, unlike his nephew's, were commended by the diarist, Sir Simonds D'Ewes, as those of a &#145;gallant and honest man&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 165, fol. 157). He favoured accommodation with the king and in February 1648 acted as teller against upholding the vote of no addresses. He did not sit in parliament after Pride's Purge in December 1648 but took his seat after the readmission of the secluded members in February 1660, and was re-elected to the Convention Parliament (April 1660).<br>
<br>Reconciled to death &#145;with patience and comfort&#146; by &#145;seeing what befell my soverign lord and master King Charles I the best of men&#146; Evelyn was buried in Godstone on 18 January 1664  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1640&#150;60</span>). Four of his seven children survived him. His elder son was created a baronet at the Restoration in 1660, and the younger entered parliament for Bletchingley as an exclusionist.<br>
