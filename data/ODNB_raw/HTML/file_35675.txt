<span class="headword">Rapson,  Edward James</span>  (1861&#150;1937), <span class="occ">Sanskritist</span>, was born at Leicester on 12 May 1861, the son of Edward Rapson, who later opened a school at Ledbury and afterwards became vicar of West Bradley, Somerset. His mother was Eleanor McArdle from co. Dublin. He was educated at Hereford Cathedral school, where he formed a lifelong interest in music, and from there went up to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1879, being elected to a foundation scholarship in 1883. He was awarded a first class in the classical tripos of 1883 and in the Indian languages tripos (Sanskrit and comparative philology) of 1885, as well as winning the Brotherton prize for Sanskrit (1884) and the Hutchinson studentship (1885). He studied Sanskrit under E. B. Cowell. His first published work, <span class="italic">The Struggle between England and France for Supremacy in India</span> (1887), had gained for him the Le Bas prize in 1886, and in 1887 he was elected into a fellowship at his college, which he held until 1893.<br>
<br>In 1887 after a short period as assistant librarian under Sir Monier Monier-Williams at the newly founded Indian Institute at Oxford, Rapson was appointed assistant keeper in the department of coins and medals at the British Museum. The rich collections of the museum provided ample scope for Rapson's talents and industry, and he soon established himself as a leading authority on Indian numismatics. His two major publications in this field are <span class="italic">Indian Coins</span> (1898), which appeared as one of the volumes of J. G. B&uuml;hler's <span class="roman">Grundriss der Indo-arischen Philologie und Altertumskunde</span>, and the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the coins of the Andhra dynasty, the western Ksatrapas, the Traik&#363;taka dynasty, and the &#145;Bodhi&#146; dynasty</span> (1908). The latter work is a masterpiece of reconstruction, and established for the first time some degree of clarity in a very obscure period of Indian history.<br>
<br>Rapson married on 8 April 1902 Ellen Daisy (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter of William B. Allen, of West Bradley; they had no children. From 1903 to 1906 he occupied, concurrently with his post in the British Museum, the chair of Sanskrit in University College, London. He left the museum in 1906 on his election to the professorship of Sanskrit at Cambridge in succession to Cecil Bendall. A born teacher and never sparing of his own time and efforts, Rapson applied himself to his new duties with conspicuous energy and success. His duties as a teacher were by no means light, but they did not prevent him from continuing his literary and scholarly work. In 1914 appeared his <span class="italic">Ancient India from the Earliest Times to the First Century <span class="smallcap">AD</span></span> which provided for the general reader an excellent summary of all that was then known about the early history and culture of India. Two major works occupied his attention during his tenure of the professorship at Cambridge. In 1901 Aurel Stein had discovered in Chinese Turkestan a collection of ancient documents written in a variety of the Indian Kharosthi script. Rapson's preliminary decipherment appeared in 1905, and for many years, in conjunction with two French scholars, Auguste M. Boyer and &Eacute;mile Senart, he worked on the task of editing the texts. The publication appeared in three parts between 1920 and 1929. His second important undertaking was editing the first two volumes of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of India</span>. The first volume was published in 1922. Preparation of the second volume occupied him for the rest of his life, but the difficulties inherent in a subject where so few collaborators could be found prevented him from realizing the project.<br>
<br>As a scholar Rapson was distinguished by great thoroughness and strict adherence to scientific method. The same virtues characterized his teaching. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1931. After holding his chair for thirty years he resigned it in 1936. A little over a year later, on 3 October 1937, he died suddenly, at St John's College, Cambridge.<br>
