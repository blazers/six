<span class="headword">Abell, Sir  Westcott Stile</span>  (1877&#150;1961), <span class="occ">naval architect and surveyor</span>, was born on 16 January 1877 at Littleham in Devon, the first of the four sons of Thomas Abell, house painter and, later, builder and member of Exmouth council for over fifty years, and of his wife, Mary Ann Stile. He also had a half-sister. He was educated at West Buckland and Devon County schools and the Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham (1892&#150;7), before proceeding in 1897 to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. At the age of twenty he lost his right hand and suffered serious throat injuries while lighting fireworks to celebrate the diamond jubilee. Despite this handicap, he taught himself to write with his left hand and recovered to such good purpose that he passed out head of his year (1900) at Greenwich with a level of marks unsurpassed for many years.<br>
<br>Abell entered the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors in 1900, was attached to the staff of the chief constructor at Devonport Dockyard, and was shortly afterwards transferred temporarily to the Admiralty to assist at the inquiry into the stability of the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>. After a further short spell at Devonport, he was posted to the Admiralty, and from 1904 to 1907 he was professional private secretary to Sir Philip Watts, director of naval construction. During this period he was closely involved with the committee on designs which had been appointed by Sir John Fisher. In 1902 Abell married Beatrice Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Joseph Wyld Davenport, dentist, of Devonport. They had one son, T. W. D. Abell, who adopted his father's profession, and three daughters, one of whom married the scientist D. W. W. Henderson.<br>
<br>In 1907 Abell became junior lecturer on naval architecture at the Royal Naval College until his selection in December 1909 to be professor of naval architecture in the newly founded chair at Liverpool. In 1909 he also became a member of the Institution of Naval Architects. In 1913 he was appointed a member of the committee of the Board of Trade to examine the application of the <span class="roman">Merchant Shipping Act</span> to the internationalization of load lines. It was for this work that he was awarded the James Watt gold medal in 1919. He was chairman of the technical subcommittee, and his lifelong interest and association with the solution of the problems of safety of life at sea probably dated from this period. His outstanding contributions to the Institution of Naval Architects on these subjects must certainly have earned him recognition by the committee of Lloyd's register of shipping, and in 1914 he was invited to fill the post of chief ship surveyor, a position which he occupied with distinction for the next fourteen years. On vacating the chair at Liverpool, he was succeeded by his brother Thomas Bertrand Abell.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Abell made a significant contribution in the field of merchant shipbuilding and was also closely associated with the Admiralty in the construction of great numbers of naval auxiliary craft. He also served on a special Admiralty committee to determine the feasibility of submarine merchant vessels to thwart the growing U-boat menace, and in 1917 was also appointed technical adviser to the controller of shipping. Among his many other commitments he was a member of a war committee on the distribution of steel and of the advisory committee on the merchant shipbuilding programme.<br>
<br>In recognition of his outstanding services Abell was created KBE in 1920, and now turned his attention to the peacetime problems of ship classification and safety. Fully aware that the war had stimulated technological advance, he directed a complete revision of the structural requirements of Lloyd's rules and effected major amendments to their philosophy, which resulted in an increase of structural efficiency and, as a corollary, the reduction of steel weights. For the first time longitudinal framing was recognized as a valid form of construction. He also recruited many young graduates of attainment who were later to rise to eminence in the service of Lloyd's.<br>
<br>Abell served on the Board of Trade load-line committee in 1927, but in 1928 he resigned his appointment with Lloyd's register to take up the chair of naval architecture at the Armstrong College of Durham University at Newcastle upon Tyne; and, shortly after his return to academic affairs, he was a British delegate at the international Safety of Life at Sea Conference in 1929. It was he who designed the channel train ferry, for which special docks had to be built at Dover and Dunkirk. Three ships were built, one of which was launched by Abell's wife. They were used for mine-laying during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Abell made many important contributions to technical institutions. His publications included <span class="italic">The Ship and her Work</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Safe Sea</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">The Shipwright's Trade</span> (1948), the last of which exhibited a profound understanding of ships and shipbuilding. It was he who was responsible for getting the <i>Cutty Sark</i> dry-docked at Greenwich, and his worry about the condition of the <i>Victory</i> at Portsmouth caused Lord Louis Mountbatten to get the woodwork restored.<br>
<br>Abell was a member of the executive committee of the National Physical Laboratory and chairman of the Froude ship research subcommittee of the ship division of the laboratory. It was in large measure due to his resource and initiative that the new ship hydrodynamics laboratory at Feltham was completed in 1959.<br>
<br>Abell was a source of help and encouragement to the younger men of his profession, particularly during his tenure of office in the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. On public occasions his experience, shrewd understanding, and wit were inestimable assets.<br>
<br>Abell was president of the Institute of Marine Engineers (1924&#150;5), master of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights (1931&#150;2), and president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers (1941). At the time of his death he was senior honorary vice-president of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. Both he and his wife held the freedom of the City of London. He did much for the Institute of Marine Engineers and Shipbuilders in Newcastle, which awarded him a gold medal and placed a gilt plaque in his honour in Bolbec Hall, Newcastle. Abell died on 29 July 1961 at his home, 95 Kenton Road, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
