<span class="headword">Warren,  Frederick</span>  (1775&#150;1848), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London in March 1775, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28788/', "Dr Richard Warren (1731&#150;1797)")</script>, physician to George III, and his wife, Elizabeth, the second daughter and third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25264/', "Dr Peter Shaw")</script>; he was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28785/', "Pelham Warren")</script>. He was admitted to Westminster School on 15 January 1783, and entered the navy in March 1789, on board the <i>Adamant</i>, flagship of Sir Richard Hughes on the Halifax station. When the <i>Adamant</i> was paid off in 1792, Warren was sent to the <i>Lion</i> (Captain Erasmus Gower), going out to China. Shortly after his return, on 24 October 1794, he was confirmed lieutenant and appointed to the <i>Prince George</i>. He afterwards served in the <i>Jason</i> on the home station, and in the <i>Latona</i> at Newfoundland, where he was promoted on 10 August 1797 to command the sloop <i>Shark</i>. In 1800 he commanded the <i>Fairy</i> (18 guns) in the West Indies, and on 12 May 1801 was promoted captain. On the renewal of the war in 1803 he commanded the sea fencibles of the Dundee district for three years. He married, in 1804, Mary, only daughter of Rear-Admiral David Laird of Strathmartine House, Dundee; they had children, among whom the eldest son, Richard Laird Warren, died an admiral in 1875.<br>
<br>In November 1806 Warren was appointed to the frigate <i>Daedalus</i> (32 guns) and took her to the West Indies, where in April 1808 he was moved to the <i>Meleager</i> (36 guns), which was wrecked on Barebush Key, near Port Royal on 30 July 1808. Warren was acquitted of blame, and officially complimented on his exertions after the ship struck. In 1809 he commanded the <i>Melpomene</i> (38 guns) in the Baltic for a few months, attacking Russian shipping off the Finnish coast, and in the fortified port of Reval. On the night of 29&#150;30 May the <i>Melpomene</i> fought in the Belt against about twenty Danish gunboats, which in a calm or light wind were formidable antagonists. At daybreak the wind freshened and the gunboats retired; the <i>Melpomene</i> had lost thirty-four men, killed and wounded, and her hull, masts, and rigging had suffered much damage, but she had saved a valuable convoy. She was shortly afterwards sent to England and sold out of the service as beyond economic repair.<br>
<br>In December 1809 Warren was appointed to the <i>Argo</i> (44 guns), which he commanded on the Lisbon station and in the Mediterranean for nearly three years. In 1814 he commanded the <i>Clarence</i> (74 guns) in the channel, and from 1825 to 1830 the <i>Spartiate</i> (76 guns). He was promoted rear-admiral on 22 July 1830; from 1831 to 1834 he was commander-in-chief at the Cape of Good Hope, and from 1837 to 1841 admiral-superintendent at Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth. There, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>,<blockquote>Amidst the rival political interests which raged in the borough to the injury of the public service, and which placed the superintendent of the dockyard very often in a difficult position, the gallant admiral, with his masterly tact, was seldom unsuccessful in defeating party intrigues, and seldom failed in having the man selected who was adapted for the place, instead of having the place adapted for the man. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 546)</blockquote>He was made vice-admiral on 23 November 1841, and died at his seat, East Court, Cosham, near Portsmouth, on 22 March 1848.<br>
