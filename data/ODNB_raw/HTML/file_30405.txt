<span class="headword">Anderson,  Alexander</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Surfaceman]</span>  (1845&#150;1909), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 30 April 1845 in the village of Kirkconnel in Upper Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire, the sixth and youngest son of the seven children of James Anderson, a quarryman, and his wife, Isabella Cowan. When the boy was three, the household moved to Crocketford in Kirkcudbright, and Anderson was educated at the village school there, where he also began to make rhymes. At sixteen he was back in his native village working in a quarry; some two years later (1862) he became a surfaceman or platelayer for the Glasgow and South-western Railway Company there.<br>
<br>It was while working there that Anderson began in free moments the course of self-culture which influenced his life. He read Shelley, Wordsworth, and Tennyson; and with the help of <span class="italic">Cassell's Educator</span> and an elementary grammar acquired French enough to puzzle out Racine and Moli&egrave;re. In the same way he later managed to read Goethe, Schiller, and Heine in German. Anderson also learned a little Italian, and acquired a smattering of Spanish and Latin. He began writing serious poetry in 1864, and between 1869 and 1872 was a prize-winner in every Christmas issue of the <span class="italic">People's Journal</span>, Dundee. Its sub-editor, A. Stewart, brought Anderson's work to the notice of George Gilfillan and advised the publication of a volume of collected pieces, <span class="italic">A Song of Labour and other Poems</span> (1873). This was reviewed very favourably. Gilfillan provided an appreciative memoir of the Surfaceman for a second volume, <span class="italic">The Two Angels and other Poems</span> (1875). This volume contains some of Anderson's best &#145;cuddle doon&#146; poems (lullabies) for children. He went on to publish from time to time in <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. In 1875 he also published the sonnet series <span class="roman">In Rome</span> and subsequently travelled to Italy, Belgium, and Germany with Archibald Cameron Corbett (later Lord Rowallan). He met Carlyle, Roden Noel, Lord Houghton, Dinah Mulock Craik, and Alexander Macmillan. His next venture, <span class="italic">Songs of the Rail</span> (1878; 3rd edn, 1881), was largely composed of railway poems from the two earlier collections. <span class="italic">Ballads and Sonnets</span> (1879), published by Macmillan, also contained a selection from the earlier volumes with new pieces. In his best poems, the vernacular of the south-west of Scotland is manipulated skilfully.<br>
<br>In October 1880 Anderson left manual labour to take up the post of assistant librarian in Edinburgh University but learned leisure failed to stimulate his poetic impulses. He therefore wrote little except for occasional verses for periodicals, mainly when on holiday among old friends at Kirkconnel. He printed some translations from Heine for private circulation, and from time to time he revised, amended, or extended a long blank verse poem on the experiences of Lazarus of Bethany. In 1883 Anderson left the university to become secretary to the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution, a library and lecture society. But in 1886 he returned to the university library as chief librarian. He died, unmarried, at his home, 22 Gillespie Crescent, on 11 July 1909, and was buried at Kirkcommen church, Kilbrae, on 14 July. A memorial was erected at Kirkconnel in 1912. In that year a collected volume of his <span class="italic">Later Poems</span> was published.<br>
