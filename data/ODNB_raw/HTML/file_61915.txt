<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jones,  (Lewis) Brian Hopkin</span>  (1942&#150;1969), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 28 February 1942 at the Park Nursing Home, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the eldest of the three children of Lewis Blount Jones, an aircraft designer, and his wife, Louisa Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simmonds, a piano teacher. He was a member of the original Rolling Stones line-up, playing on most of their classic 1960s recordings and furthering their teen appeal as the &#145;pretty boy&#146; of the band. Jones was educated at the Dean Close junior school and Pates Grammar School in Cheltenham. He was academically bright, as well as proficient in playing the saxophone, harmonica, clarinet, guitar, and piano. Early in his musical career he played &#145;trad jazz&#146; with the Cheltone Six, and rhythm and blues with the Ramrods. After leaving school he worked in a number of jobs without enthusiasm, including junior architect, bus conductor, and coal deliverer. A significant meeting was with the musician Alexis Korner, who encouraged Jones to move to London in 1962. Shortly after that Mick Jagger and Keith Richards spotted Jones playing blues slide guitar in a club, and were impressed by the young man's musical prowess.<br>
<br>Jones was shy, slightly narcissistic, softly spoken, and with a strong sense of fashion that helped to define the slightly foppish elegance of the quintessential mid-1960s English rock star. Friends have described Jones as psychologically troubled even before his success in the music business, and Jagger has at times characterized Jones as too sensitive to be in the pop world. Jones was certainly sensitive to the spirit of the times, and soon acquainted himself with Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and other rock luminaries. By 1967 he was a celebrity, introducing Hendrix on stage at the Monterey pop festival, and subject to several prosecutions for drug possession.<br>
<br>The Stones recorded their first record in 1963, a cover of Chuck Berry's &#145;Come On&#146;. In the early years it was Jones who was very much the self-appointed musical leader of the group, contributing slide guitar parts influenced by Elmore James and blues harp-playing to give the Stones' initial recordings more authenticity. His broader musical interests did much to widen the band's basic blues&#150;rhythm and blues axis and enable them to progress. The 1966 &#145;Paint it Black&#146; single featured a sitar line from Jones, who was ever conscious of the need for the Stones to keep up with the experiments of their arch-rivals, the Beatles. He added marimba to &#145;Under my Thumb&#146; and dulcimer to &#145;Lady Jane&#146;. Such multi-instrumental touches gave significant colour to the sequence of brilliant singles the Stones released between 1965 and 1968, and the albums <span class="italic">Between the Buttons</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Their Satanic Majesties Request</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">Beggar's Banquet</span> (1969). Guitars associated with Jones include the Vox mark VI teardrop-shape and the Gibson Firebird.<br>
<br>Along with George Harrison and Jimmy Page, Jones deserves credit for introducing into Western popular music the first glimmerings of sensitivity to other musical traditions. He was fascinated by Moroccan music, just as Harrison drew on Indian music, in an era when &#145;world music&#146; had not been invented. He recorded <span class="italic">Pipes of Pan at Joujouka</span> and a film score for Volker Schlondorff's <span class="italic">A Degree of Murder</span>. Unfortunately personal problems, an increasing drug intake, and unreliability led to tensions between Jones and the other members of the group, who distanced themselves from him. Matters were not improved when Anita Pallenberg, the German actress with whom Jones had been involved in a tempestuous relationship since 1965, left him for Keith Richards in May 1968. He was given the sack early in 1969. Supposedly his drug convictions were preventing the band from touring America, and he was replaced in the Stones by the guitarist Mick Taylor.<br>
<br>Jones died at his home, Cotchford Farm, Hartfield, Sussex, on 3 July 1969, apparently by drowning in his swimming pool &#145;whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs&#146;  (d. cert.): the coroner's verdict was misadventure.<br>
<br>Jones's premature death was the first of a series (Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison) which silenced a number of 1960s rock icons between 1969 and 1971. Jagger read an extract from Shelley's &#145;Adonais&#146; at a free concert at Hyde Park on 5 July, which turned into a requiem for Jones, who was buried at Cheltenham on 11 July. Although portrayed by the establishment of the day as an act of self-destruction typical of rock-star excess, Jones's drowning was always regarded by many as suspicious. New leads in the case were followed up in the 1990s after an apparent deathbed confession from a builder who was working on Jones's home. The mystery surrounding Jones's death is dealt with in detail in Terry Rawlings's <span class="italic">Who Killed Christopher Robin?</span> (1994) and Laura Jackson's <span class="italic">Golden Stone</span> (1992).<br>
