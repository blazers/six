<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Little,  William John</span>  (1810&#150;1894), <span class="occ">orthopaedic surgeon</span>, was born on 7 August 1810 at the Red Lion inn, Red Lion Street, Whitechapel, London, the only son and eldest of three children of John Little, proprietor of the Red Lion inn, and his wife, Hannah. The family were related to the Littles who for many generations lived in Carbrooke, Norfolk. At the age of two Little developed a club foot, presumed to be due to poliomyelitis. After schooling at Goodman's Fields, London, and St Margaret's, Dover, he was, from the age of thirteen, educated at the Jesuit college of St Omer, France, winning the laurel wreath for French studies. After being apprenticed to Mr James Sequeira in 1826, his indenture was cancelled in 1828 and he began five years as an apprentice apothecary with the Apothecaries' Company of London. He studied at the London Hospital and the Aldersgate school of medicine. He became MRCS (1832) and MRCP (1837).<br>
<br>In 1834 Little went to study with Johannes M&uuml;ller at the University of Berlin in order to discover what could be done to correct his club-foot, which English surgeons refused to treat, leaving it to the bone-setters. During the course of dissections of cadaver club-feet, Little recognized the role of muscles and tendons rather than bones in this deformity. In 1836 Dr Louis Stromeyer of Hanover successfully undertook Achilles tendon division for Little's club-foot. Little received a doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1837 for his work on the nature of club-foot. During the same year he married Elizabeth (&#145;Isa&#146;), daughter of Thomas Roff Tamplin, brewer, of Horsted Keynes, Sussex, and brother of R. W. Tamplin, surgeon to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital. They had four sons and seven daughters, only seven of whom reached maturity. His fourth son, Edward Muirhead Little, became a well-known orthopaedic surgeon on the staff of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. His grandson was Admiral Sir Charles Little.<br>
<br>From 1837 Little began to introduce the Stromeyer technique of tenotomy into England. The operation involved anterior division of the Achilles tendon just above the ankle, without anaesthetic, followed by splintage and manipulation. Little's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Nature of Club-Foot and Analogous Distortions</span> (1839) recognized the association between fever and club-foot, and came close to describing foot deformity secondary to poliomyelitis. In 1839 Little was elected assistant physician at the London Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1840 Little founded the Orthopaedic Institution in Bloomsbury, an infirmary for the cure of club-foot and other distortions, and for the study of orthopaedics. In so doing he played an important part in the development of modern British orthopaedics. The Orthopaedic Institution became the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in 1845, but Little had resigned in 1844. In the following year he was appointed physician to the London Hospital, and he held this position until he resigned in 1863. In 1854 the Revd Andrew Reed, a friend of Little's, established the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and Little became medical examiner and a member of the governing board.<br>
<br>Little continued his pioneering work throughout his career. In 1843, in a series of lectures at the Orthopaedic Institution (published in 1855 as <span class="italic">Lectures on the Deformities of the Human Frame</span>), he described what became known as &#145;Little's disease&#146;, a spastic paralysis of both lower limbs secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Little recognized that the cause was an abnormal birth which produced brain damage and secondary spasticity of the limbs. In 1843 he published <span class="italic">On ankylosis or stiff joint: a practical treatise on the contractions and deformities resulting from diseases of joints</span>. In 1847 he described two boys with what was obviously pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophy, itself described twenty-one years later by Guillaume Duchenne. <span class="italic">On the Nature and Treatment of the Deformities of the Human Frame</span> appeared in 1853, and <span class="italic">Spinal Weakness and Spinal Curvature</span> was published in 1868.<br>
<br>In 1877 Little was elected FRCP, a rare honour for a surgeon. He visited North America in 1878, and was elected honorary member of the American Orthopaedic Association in 1890. Little died at home in Ryarsh, West Malling, near Maidstone, Kent, on 7 July 1894, and was buried there.<br>
