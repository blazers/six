</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davies,  John</span>  (1564/5&#150;1618), <span class="occ">poet and writing-master</span>, was born at Hereford (his birthplace was always noted on his title-pages&#151;&#145;John Davies of Hereford&#146;&#151;apparently to distinguish him from the prominent contemporary poet Sir John Davies). He was probably born a Roman Catholic and was certainly identified as one in 1611  (Peck, 461), but nothing in his voluminous religious poetry suggests a strong adherence to Catholicism. Of his early life it is known only that he was of Welsh descent and that he had two brothers and two sisters. He had no higher education, but because he resided for a time at Oxford as a teacher of handwriting, some (notably Anthony Wood) mistakenly thought he had studied there. By 1605 at the latest, Davies took up residence in London.<br>
<br>It is not certain how Davies acquired his handwriting expertise, although a hint from Pepys's calligraphical collection suggests that he was tutored by a London writing-master named Daniel Johnson. Thomas Fuller in his <span class="italic">Worthies of England</span> called Davies &#145;the greatest master of the pen that England in her age beheld&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.79), and his renown reached as far as Germany according to a commendatory poem in Davies's <span class="italic">Microcosmos</span>  (Davies, 104). His book <span class="italic">Writing Schoolmaster, or, The Anatomy of Fair Writing</span> (earliest surviving edition, 1633) exhibits engraved specimen-copies of his handwriting together with a set of practical directions for learners. His writing students included royalty (Prince Henry) and the highest nobility. If his incessant complaints are to be trusted, Davies was not richly rewarded for his teaching. The earl of Northumberland's book of household expenses would seem to confirm this, recording in 1607 a payment &#145;To John Davis for teaching Lord Percy to write, for a year, 20 l.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sixth Report</span>, HMC, 229). None the less, his teaching put him in contact with many of the most important families in the country including (in addition to the Percys, with whom he resided in 1607 and 1609&#150;10) the Herberts, the Pembrokes, Thomas, Lord Ellesmere, and his wife, the countess dowager of Derby. He was also friendly with many of the great artists of the period. Even if Davies's links to Sir Philip Sidney are questionable, he was on the periphery of the brilliant circle of wits (among them Donne and Jonson) who wrote panegyric verses for the 1611 edition of &#145;Coryat's Crudities&#146;, Lord Herbert of Cherbury wrote a prefatory poem to him, and he was an acquaintance of Inigo Jones.<br>
<br>This constant contact with the great and famous must have given Davies the social mobility that explains his marriages to women distinctly above him socially. Mary Croft (<i>d</i>. 1612), his first wife, was a relative of the family that owned Croft Castle, Shropshire. With Mary he had his only child, a son named Sylvanus. In 1613, when he was aged forty-eight, he married Dame Juliana Preston (<i>d</i>. 1614), the widow of Sir Amyas Preston, the naval commander and keeper of the stores and ordinance in the Tower of London. While only the first name of Davies's third wife, Margaret, is known, the mention in his will of the &#145;plate and jewells as were hers before marriage&#146; suggests that she too was well placed. About such marriages, he passed on some apparently hard-earned wisdom:<blockquote>
<div>He that would faine reduce an high-borne Wife<br>
</div>
<div>Unto the Compasse of his meane estate,<br>
</div>
<div>Must not at first, stick for a little Strife.<br>
</div> (&#145;Wittes Pilgrimage&#146;, Davies, 1.xvi)</blockquote>Anthony Wood declared that &#145;finding not a subsistence by poetry&#146;, Davies earned his living as a writing-master  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 2.260). Nevertheless, throughout his teaching career Davies published vast quantities of poetry. He attempted every kind except the dramatic, but his main efforts were religious, moral, and psychological treatises or sermons. The seriousness of his ambition is suggested by the title to his first separately published poem, <span class="italic">Mirum in modum: a Glimpse of Gods Glorie and the Soules Shape</span> (1602). His second and longest poem, <span class="italic">Microcosmos</span> (1603), is similarly ambitious, a 6000 line treatise on the passions and affections with many digressions on human affairs in general. There were ten more weighty volumes, most of them the sort of didactic religious poetry then much in vogue. Patrons of poetry like the Sidneys and King James wrote such poems themselves; literary theory (for example, Sidney's <span class="italic">Defense</span>) called for such subjects, and Guillaume du Bartas's <span class="italic">Divine Works and Days</span>, especially in Josuah Sylvester's version, served as a highly esteemed model.<br>
<br>But Davies never gained any recognition or financial profit for his poetry; only one of his works ever reached a second edition. The reason would seem to be distressingly clear. As Douglas Bush put it, &#145;the master (in Fuller's words) of fast, fair, close, and various handwriting was as a poet slow, laborious, diffuse, and flat&#146;  (Bush, 86). Davies's creative method was to versify prose tracts like Pierre de la Primaudaye's <span class="italic">L'Academie Francoise</span> (1577), Sir Philip Sidney's translation of Mornay's <span class="italic">Verit&eacute; de la religion chriestienne</span>, and Puttenham's <span class="italic">Art of Poesie</span>. Davies condensed, simplified, and omitted much from his sources, and the product was an incoherent and clumsy patchwork of philosophical fragments, often in unreadable technical language. Davies may have been one of the most voluminous didactic poets of the age; he was also one of the most tedious.<br>
<br>While the bulk of Davies's poetry was religious, he also wrote love sonnets, satires, epigrams, panegyrics, eclogues, among other kinds. In the <span class="italic">Wittes Pilgrimage</span> volume (1610&#150;11?) there is a sonnet sequence about a frustrating love affair that is much superior to his religious poetry. Unfortunately it was written at a moment nearly saturated with dazzling Petrarchan sonnet sequences and, refreshingly, he seems to notice the mediocrity of the 101 sonnets he has been creating. In sonnet 102 he suddenly asks:<blockquote>
<div>Busie Invention, whie art thou so dull<br>
</div>
<div>And yet still doing?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>It is a question he should have asked more frequently. With his &#145;The triumph of death or the picture of the plague &hellip; [of] 1603&#146; in <span class="italic">Humours Heav'n on Earth</span> (1609), Davies had a compelling subject in plague-stricken London. It led unavoidably to some effective descriptions, but his inveterate prolixity and comparison with such vivid accounts as Dekker's &#145;The wonderful year 1603&#146; once again make his version forgettable.<br>
<br>In fact, of all Davies's work only his volume of epigrams <span class="italic">The Scourge of Folly</span> (1610) is mentioned today. It is not because he had discovered in epigrams the natural medium for his muse&#151;they too are relatively lame&#151;but because he addresses many of the 292 epigrams to the greatest writers and most important figures of the period: the king, Francis Bacon, Sir John Davies, Fulke Greville, Thomas Campion, Samuel Daniel, Ben Jonson, William Shakespeare, John Fletcher, John Marston, Joseph Hall, Herbert of Cherbury, Francis Beaumont, Michael Drayton, and George Chapman, among others. It is unclear how many of them he knew personally, but the fact that he says to Chapman, &#145;I know thee not (good George) but by thy pen&#146; suggests some personal knowledge of the others. Unfortunately, Davies's writing is so vague that little is gained from whatever intimacy he might have had with his subjects. This is particularly disappointing in the case of Shakespeare, who is promisingly addressed as &#145;our English Terence&#146;, but in maddeningly cryptic language Davies tells Shakespeare that:<blockquote>
<div>hadst thou not played some kingly parts in sport,<br>
</div>
<div>Thou hadst been a companion for a king.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>With all the vast ingenuity spent on Shakespearian biography, no one has come close to explaining those lines.Davies did have one respectable contemporary admirer, William Browne of Tavistock, who in his <span class="italic">Britannia's Pastorals</span> enthusiastically linked him with the poet George Wither:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">by whose Muses' power<br>
</div>
<div>A natural day to me seems but an hour<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1.240)</blockquote>Few subsequent readers have had Browne's endurance. Davies died on 6 July 1618 and was buried that day near his first wife in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. His wife Margaret survived him.<br>
