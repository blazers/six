<span class="headword">Foulis,  David</span>  (1710&#150;1773), <span class="occ">composer and physician</span>, was born on 8 October 1710 at Woodhall, Currie, Edinburghshire, the second of two sons and four daughters born to William Foulis (1674&#150;1737) of Woodhall, an advocate, and his second wife, Helen Hepburn. David Foulis studied medicine at Edinburgh University under Alexander Monro from 1729 to 1732 before pursuing further medical studies in Leiden and Rheims in 1734&#150;5. He graduated MD from Rheims on 10 October 1735 and was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh on 2 August 1737. From June 1741 until his death, Foulis was employed as physician to George Heriot's Hospital, the prestigious charity school in Edinburgh, a position which he shared with his good friend Colin Drummond from 1766.<br>
<br>Foulis is more noteworthy as one of very few Scottish-born composers of the eighteenth century. It is unknown where he gained his musical education, but he probably learned some music as a boy before being exposed to the work of Italian composers when a student in the Netherlands and France. His compositions have been seen as expressions of the enthusiasm of Scottish musicians in the mid-eighteenth century for Italian music, widely shared in the Edinburgh Musical Society, of which he was elected a member on 8 June 1737 and was a director in 1739. His works suggest that he played the violin. As well as contributing two pieces to Niel Stewart's <span class="italic">Collection of Marches &amp; Airs</span>, published in Edinburgh about 1761, Foulis wrote a distinguished set of six violin sonatas which were privately published about 1770 in Edinburgh as <span class="italic">Six Solos for the Violin with a Bass for a Violoncello or Harpsichord</span>. The &#145;Gentleman&#146; composer was not named, but the ascription of the works to Foulis, first made by William Stenhouse in his notes printed with the 1839 edition of James Johnson's <span class="italic">The Scots Musical Museum</span>, has never been challenged. The dedicatee, Francis Charteris, a well-known patron of music in late eighteenth-century Edinburgh, may have funded the publication. Foulis would certainly have known Charteris through the Edinburgh Musical Society.<br>
<br>Foulis's finances seem to have run into difficulties after 1750. On 20 June 1753 he was struck off the membership list of the Edinburgh Musical Society for failing to pay his subscriptions, but later that year he negotiated a pay rise from &pound;20 to &pound;30 p.a. from Heriot's. His absence from the meetings of the Royal College of Physicians between January 1758 and July 1761 may suggest ill health. His situation had recovered sufficiently for him to serve as a councillor of the college from December 1764 to December 1765, but after 1 May 1770 he was in receipt of a pension of 7<i>s</i>. weekly from the college. It was this body that subsidized his nursing care from February 1773 (when he was lodging with Miss Paton on Castle Hill, Edinburgh) until he died, presumably in Edinburgh, at some time before 19 April 1773, when Heriot's recognized Drummond as their sole physician on account of Foulis's death. There is no record of any will, nor is Foulis's place of burial known. The biggest enigma in Foulis's life is why he should have died in such an impecunious state, only miles from the large family mansion at Woodhall, near Edinburgh. He might have expected some kind of legacy on the death of his father in 1737 (his elder brother John having died in 1732), but William Foulis's will clearly excludes David, passing all the family property to John's son William. It is possible that David had incurred the family's wrath, perhaps by continuing his studies abroad after the death of John, or perhaps through his marriage. Not even the name of his wife is known; the only record of his marriage is a handwritten family tree among miscellaneous Foulis papers in Edinburgh Central Library which states: &#145;David practised as a physician in Edinr and died married&#146;  (XDA 758.3 F76).<br>
