<span class="headword">Brereton,  William</span>  (1750<span class="mult">x</span>51&#150;1787), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was probably born at Bath, a son of William Brereton (1723&#150;1813) of Carrigslaney, co. Carlow, Ireland, and his first wife, Marion Edmonston (<i>d</i>. 1782), reputedly a cousin of Flora MacDonald. The Breretons of Carrigslaney were descended through Sir William Brereton (<i>d</i>. 1541?), lord high marshal of Ireland, from the family of Brereton of Brereton, Cheshire. Brereton's father, a major in the 6th Inniskilling dragoon guards, had fought at Culloden and between 1777 and 1780 was master of ceremonies at the Lower Assembly Rooms at Bath. His brother Robert (1747&#150;1816) rose to major-general in the army and was lieutenant-governor of St Lucia; his father's second marriage produced <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3334/', "Sir William Brereton (1789&#150;1864)")</script>, army officer.<br>
<br>Promoted by David Garrick, a family friend, Brereton made his d&eacute;but on 10 November 1768 at Drury Lane&#151;where he was to act tragic and comic parts for another seventeen years&#151;in the title role of John Home's <span class="italic">Douglas</span>. Despite his good looks and fine voice Brereton earned harsh and often disparaging reviews. None the less Garrick cast him as Chamont in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, Altamont in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, and as Shakespeare's Romeo, Orlando, and Posthumus. Following the 1774&#150;5 season at Drury Lane, Brereton spent the summer in Dublin where, unknown to Garrick, he signed articles with the manager Spranger Barry. Though exasperated with Brereton's disloyalty, Garrick eventually relented, for Brereton returned to Drury Lane in the autumn. Following Garrick's retirement in June 1776 Brereton was retained by the new manager, Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span> discerned a &#145;bloated vulgarity&#146; about Brereton &#145;which should ever deter the manager from assigning [him] the parts of cavaliers or men of fashion&#146;  (I. McIntyre, <span class="italic">Garrick</span>, 1999, 557). Yet William Hopkins, the Drury Lane prompter, wrote &#145;very well&#146; in his diary after Brereton's first performance as George Barnwell in George Lillo's <span class="italic">The London Merchant</span> in December 1775. On 24 September 1777, at Bath, Brereton married Hopkins's daughter Priscilla (1758&#150;1845) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15324/', "Kemble, Priscilla")</script>]. The couple's son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1832), was born in May 1782 in King's co., Ireland, and later became a lieutenant-colonel in the army.<br>
<br>Thomas Davies had noted that as Mendoza in Robert Jephson's <span class="italic">Braganza</span>, Brereton<blockquote>gave the publick a happy presage of that improved state of acting to which he is now arrived. When he has thrown off that diffidence which hangs about him, and has acquired a greater confidence in his power to please, I dare venture to prophesy he will be an excellent performer. (Davies, 2.298&#150;9)</blockquote>The return of Sarah Siddons to Drury Lane in December 1782 was the catalytic force that breached Brereton's diffidence. Reportedly he was smitten with her. Whatever the truth, he &#145;derived a new soul from the collision&#146;  (Boaden, 1.345). In no play was his thespian transformation more striking than in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserved</span>, in which he played Jaffeir to Mrs Siddons's Belvidera. On 21 December the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> declared that his performance had &#145;touched the <i>true Chords</i> in Unison with Belvidera! &hellip; it was unequivocally the Hand of a <i>Master!</i>&#146; Between 1782 and 1785 he acted with Siddons in tragedies such as <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, Aaron Hill's <span class="italic">Zara</span>, and Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">The Grecian Daughter</span>. They had performed together previously at Drury Lane early in 1776 in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Epicoene</span>.<br>
<br>The Siddons&#150;Brereton association reached a painful impasse in Dublin during the summer season of 1784 over a benefits dispute; this was misrepresented to the public, who blamed Mrs Siddons. Increasingly unstable on stage and off, Brereton is said to have attempted suicide and threatened his wife. On 5 October 1784 Mrs Siddons and William and Priscilla Brereton returned to Drury Lane where, in <span class="italic">The Gamester</span> by Edward Moore, Siddons faced a hostile, hissing audience. Neither of the Breretons defended her, for which Sheridan's sister Betsy much blamed them. They played at Portsmouth in summer 1785, when unmistakable signs of his mental illness&#151;encouraged, some said, by his unrequited love for Mrs Siddons but more probably by excessive drinking&#151;became apparent to audiences. Brereton improvised ludicrous lines, obliged his wife to dance an unscripted minuet, and abruptly walked off stage in a critical scene. For pelting a magistrate's carriage he and two fellow actors were forced to make a public apology. Back at Drury Lane on 3 November 1785 Brereton gave his last performance as Frederick in Garrick's adaptation of Francis Beaumont's and John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Chances</span>. The night before he had played Claudio to Sarah Siddons's Isabella in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>.<br>
<br>It was reported thirteen days later that Brereton had suffered a relapse of his mental illness. He was overpowered by keepers posing as bailiffs, despite attempts to ward them off with a poker, strait-jacketed, and taken by coach to a private house at Blackheath, to the south-east of London, where, on being denied access to his wife, he wept bitterly. Hopes of his recovery were soon abandoned. His malady was not &#145;productive of any violence, but rather of ridiculous actions, accompanied by melancholy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Nov 1785). A year later, having been confined for some time at the private lunatic asylum at Hoxton, north of the city of London, in the care of the eminent mad-doctor John Monro (or his son Thomas), he was &#145;in so nervous a state, that he can scarcely utter a sentence&#146;  (ibid., 2 Nov 1786), though he recognized friends and retained power of recollection. For his support Priscilla Brereton gave &pound;100 a year in addition to the &pound;70 contributed by the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund.<br>
<br>Brereton's illness was no shield from the verse satire of Anthony Pasquin (1786), but some reserved judgement on what might have been, had not the &#145;hydrophobia of a Lear ensued&#146;  (<span class="italic">Green-Room Mirror</span>, 14). John Quick the comedian took him to church, at which he sat patiently and behaved well. Brereton greeted the clergyman afterwards:<blockquote>&#145;Sir &hellip; you act charmingly&#151;but your part is too long&#151;here's Quick here will cut it for you.&#146; The Clergyman looked astonished&#151;and the Comedian laying hold of the Tragedian&#151;cut all further discourse&#151;by taking poor Brereton out of the church. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Feb 1787)</blockquote>The physicians &#145;sometimes used to recall his memory to the stage:&#151;at those intervals, he would mention the name of Mrs Siddons&#151;and sometimes of a picture he wished to have had drawn of her and himself&#146;  (ibid.). Whatever his feelings for Mrs Siddons, the actor long &#145;considered rather serviceable than great&#146;  (Boaden, 1.345) basked in her reflected glory. His regretful musings on the unpainted portrait may show more desire to enshrine fleeting fame than to mourn unrequited love.<br>
<br>Brereton died of unknown causes at Dr Monro's lunatic asylum, Hoxton, on 17 February 1787 and was buried in Shoreditch churchyard. Brereton's unstable personality and unfulfilled promise as a performer intrigued many, but few knew what to make of him. His perceived infatuation for Mrs Siddons, his descent into madness, and, following his death, his widow's speedy marriage to Sarah Siddons's brother&#151;his former rival actor&#151;John Philip Kemble, united the four in a private drama worthy of an eighteenth-century Gothic novel. A curious biographical piece, illustrated with Brereton's portrait as Douglas&#151;equal parts obituary, castigation, and grudging appreciation&#151;appeared in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> for June 1796. In January 1832 Brereton's son, Thomas, committed suicide during his trial by court martial following the Bristol riots of October 1831.<br>
