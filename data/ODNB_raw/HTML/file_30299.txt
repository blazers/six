<span class="headword">Zouch,  Thomas</span>  (1737&#150;1815), <span class="occ">biographer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the rectory at Sandal Magna, near Wakefield, Yorkshire, on 12 September 1737, the second son of Charles Zouch (<i>d</i>. 1754), vicar of Sandal Magna, and his wife, Dorothy (1695/6&#150;1760), daughter of Gervase Norton of Wakefield. His early years seem to have been happy, and he remained deeply attached to Yorkshire and particularly to the country around Sandal Magna throughout his life. Zouch began his studies at home where, under his father's tutelage, he developed a solid grounding in Latin and Greek, before attending Wakefield's free grammar school, which counted Richard Bentley and John Radcliffe among its alumni. There he was taught by Benjamin Wilson and John Clarke, both masters of the school. Much later in life Zouch published a biography of Clarke, celebrating him as the model of &#145;the good schoolmaster&#146;, one who, though exacting in the teaching of ancient literatures, still &#145;accommodated himself with equal affability and kindness to all&#146;  (Zouch, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.14). In part, Zouch writes his own life in writing Clarke's, a life happily passed in the study of antiquity and the defence of England's ecclesiastical constitution.<br>
<br>It was to Clarke's college, Trinity, Cambridge, that Zouch proceeded at the relatively advanced age of eighteen, being admitted pensioner on 8 July 1756. Zouch's academic career was without a doubt brilliant, and he garnered many awards and honours in his thirteen years at Trinity. Within a year he became a scholar of the college&#151;a welcome saving, since his father had now been dead three years. In 1760 he won one of two university-wide Craven scholarships, worth &pound;20 per annum, and graduated BA, with the distinction of second wrangler. He was ordained a deacon and stayed at Trinity, winning two prizes of 15 guineas each in the annual members' Latin essay competition: in 1762 he came second among the middle bachelors and in 1763 first among the seniors, in the latter case for a lively satirical essay on Rousseau's account of the origins of society. Zouch showed diligence in performing the drudgery reserved for junior fellows&#151;including, it seems, writing college verses in Greek for Michael Lort, professor of Greek, who had little taste for such tiresome exercises&#151;and he was rewarded with considerable responsibility. He held various college appointments and offices&#151;minor fellow (1762), major fellow (1764), <i>sublector primus</i> (1765), <i>lector linguae Latinae</i> (1768). His main income in these years was from teaching: as assistant tutor to Thomas Postlethwaite he earned &pound;60 per annum, and he took on several private pupils. He also contributed verses in Latin and English to various university collections celebrating state occasions, and his much admired poem &#145;Crucifixion&#146; won the Seatonian prize in 1765. When the master of Trinity, Robert Smith, died in 1768, Zouch was chosen to deliver the Latin funeral oration. But he was already experiencing bouts of deafness, a condition from which he suffered for the rest of his life. These attacks became so severe that he often could not hear the responses to the psalms, and once began a sermon while the organ was still playing. Deafness was not readily compatible with the largely oratorical world of Cambridge teaching and ceremony, and Zouch sought more secluded employment in a university living. In recognition of his services he was instituted in 1770 to the rectory of Wycliffe, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, where he was to live for the next twenty-three years.<br>
<br>After an initial contest with the local Roman Catholic landholders who had the patronage of Wycliffe and who objected to the university's nomination, Zouch settled down in his early thirties to what was promising to be a relatively quiet and undemanding clerical life. On 9 July 1772 he married Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1803), daughter of John Emerson, rector of Winston, co. Durham. To supplement his income he took in pupils from the local gentry, three at a time, but his duties left him ample time to study, and he devoted himself to ancient and modern literature, and to the antiquities and botany of his home county; in particular he began gathering information towards a comprehensive biographical dictionary of Yorkshire worthies, a project he never completed. This middle period of Zouch's life was uneventful, almost reclusive. In 1780 he became, at the encouragement of his more politically active elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30298/', "Henry Zouch")</script>, a member of the Yorkshire Association, and undoubtedly he sympathized with that society's protest against recent royal excesses and its call for moderate electoral reform, but he never attended a meeting and soon let his membership lapse. Similarly, although he had gained sufficient repute as a botanist to be elected fellow of the Linnean Society when it first met in 1788, he never communicated any of his discoveries or specimens to that body.<br>
<br>Zouch might well have lived his life in this modest retirement but for the energetic interference of two powerful friends. The first was Richard Pepper Arden (1745&#150;1804), later Baron Alvanley, who had been one of Zouch's private pupils at Trinity. From Cambridge, Pepper Arden had gone to Lincoln's Inn, where he shared a staircase with William Pitt, before proceeding on a brilliant legal and political career, ultimately serving Pitt as solicitor-general and attorney-general. Zouch's second well-wisher was the younger William Lowther. Zouch's sister Anne had married Sir William Lowther, rector of Swillington and third cousin to the unsavoury James Lowther, earl of Lonsdale (1736&#150;1802), the support of whose extensive and powerful political machine was much valued by Pitt. Their eldest son, William, was chosen by the childless earl as heir to his enormous wealth. William had been tutored by Zouch at Wycliffe, and the two remained close throughout Zouch's life. A more ambitious (and, possibly, a healthier) cleric than Zouch might have made more of two such patrons as Pepper Arden and Lowther, but then no doubt he was sought out for his solidity rather than his brilliance as a theologian or energy as an administrator of the church. In any case his first sinecures came thanks to Pepper Arden, who made Zouch his chaplain when he became master of the rolls in 1788, and who secured for him the deputy commissary of the archdeaconry of Richmond. Then Pitt, who at the behest of the Lowthers had been seeking out a richer living for Zouch for some time, was able in the king's name to bestow the rectory of Scrayingham in the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1793. When Zouch's brother Henry died in 1795 Zouch inherited the family estate at Sandal Magna, where he went to live in 1796, establishing a curate at Scrayingham. From 1799 to 1805 Zouch was a governor of Wakefield school, and he also founded an endowed school at Sandal Magna. Pitt remained active on Zouch's behalf, proposing him in 1798 for the mastership of Trinity College (a post that went to William Mansel, bishop of Bristol) and finally securing Zouch a lucrative place as canon and prebendary of Durham Cathedral in 1805, upon which occasion Zouch took the degree of doctor of divinity.<br>
<br>It was during these latter years at Sandal Magna that Zouch began publishing. Apart from sermons and a few tracts on biblical prophecy, Zouch concentrated his energy on biography. He wrote and circulated privately several brief accounts of pious and eminent Yorkshiremen, but is chiefly remembered for his more substantial lives of Izaak Walton and Sir Philip Sidney. Zouch's first publication on Walton was an edition of the rare 1680 tract <span class="italic">Love and Truth in Two Modest and Peaceable Letters</span> (1795), followed by a splendid edition, dedicated to Pepper Arden, of Walton's <span class="italic">Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, Herbert and Sanderson</span> (1796), fully annotated and introduced with Zouch's own life of Walton. Here Zouch casts Walton as the exemplary Londoner, fully conversant with the world but unwavering in his attachment to church and crown, one who adopts a &#145;mild spirit of moderation&#146; in a troubled age  (p. xlix). If Zouch models in Walton the long-suffering protestant citizen, he finds in Sidney the perfect protestant knight. <span class="italic">The Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Sir Philip Sydney</span> (1808), dedicated to Zouch's nephew William Lowther, now earl of Lonsdale, is a response in part to the unflattering character given to Sidney by Horace Walpole. Zouch depicts late sixteenth-century Europe as a Gothic world of seductive Jesuits and brutal Catholic princes, all bent upon the genocide of protestants. Sidney as diplomat and soldier stands alone amid these dangers in his &#145;uniform zeal for the reformed religion&#146;  (Zouch, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir Philip Sydney</span>, 91). Like so many writing in the wake of the French Revolution, Zouch is most concerned with shoring up British social and religious hierarchies and promoting political order. Although he can be credited with much original archival research on both Walton and Sidney, in general he practises the same improving biographical method he found at work in Walton's <span class="italic">Lives</span>, presenting &#145;examples of men strictly and faithfully discharging their professional duties&#146; with the overall aim of invigorating his reader's &#145;efforts to excel in moral worth&#146;  (Walton, <span class="italic">Lives</span>, ed. Zouch, ix). Zouch did not move in literary circles, but his biographies were widely read. Robert Southey, visiting his brother at Durham in the summer of 1809, made a point of dining with Zouch. And in 1805 Zouch admired (and corrected) some of Wordsworth's poetry, passed on to him in manuscript by Lonsdale; Zouch complained that &#145;the terms <i>green</i> and <i>bowers</i> are used too often&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lonsdale MSS</span>, 154).<br>
<br>In 1807 Zouch was offered the bishopric of Carlisle, but he declined on determining that Carlisle was not worth more than the livings he had in hand. His health was not good and there was little financial incentive to move. Isabella had died in 1803, and on 25 August 1808 Zouch married Margaret (1743&#150;1833), second daughter of William Brooke of Dodworth, Yorkshire. Neither marriage produced any children. Zouch died at Sandal Magna on 17 December 1815 and was buried there on 23 December.<br>
