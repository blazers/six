<span class="headword">Meikle,  James</span>  (1730&#150;1799), <span class="occ">surgeon and religious writer</span>, was born at Carnwath, in the upper part of Clydesdale, on 19 May 1730, the fifth child of George Meikle (<i>d</i>. 1748), a surgeon and druggist. James, a delicate boy, received little regular education; but he was religiously brought up by his parents, and when about sixteen years old joined the &#145;Secession&#146; church, a body which had separated from the established church of Scotland in 1732.<br>
<br>Meikle's wish to study at Edinburgh for the ministry remained unfulfilled owing to his poverty and the death of his father in February 1748, which left his mother and two sisters dependent on his earnings. He managed to attend some medical lectures at Edinburgh, and returned to Carnwath in 1750, intending as a temporary expedient to practise as a surgeon before becoming a minister. But his difficulties grew, and in December 1757 he decided to join the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>After passing the examination at Surgeons' Hall in London Meikle was appointed second surgeon's mate to the <i>Portland</i>, a 50-gun ship, in April 1758. Although he was distressed by the loose conduct both of the officers and the crew, writing at one point that their &#145;wickedness made me weary of my life&#146;  (Peddie, lx), they grew to respect him. Meikle spent much of his time reading and writing; many of the &#145;Meditations&#146;, which afterwards appeared in <span class="italic">The Traveller</span> and in <span class="italic">Solitude Sweetened</span>, were written at this time. After cruising off the western coast of France and in the Mediterranean, the <i>Portland</i> was ordered to join the fleet under Admiral Boscawen, and took part in the victory off Cape Lagos on 18 August 1759. His ship being ordered home with the prisoners and for repairs, Meikle reached Spithead on 16 September. An application to the Admiralty for his release from the service was refused, but he was promoted to the rank of first mate, and put to sea again on 22 October. He joined the fleet under Admiral Hawke, and took part in the victory off Belleisle on 20 November.<br>
<br>After repeated applications Meikle finally obtained his discharge in February 1762, and immediately returned to Carnwath. He went to Edinburgh for some months in the summer of 1764 to continue his medical studies. In 1779 he married his first wife Agnes Smith, who died in 1781; he married again in November 1785. In July 1789 he was ordained to the eldership in the congregation of Biggar, and continued his devotional writings to the last week of his life, dying rather suddenly on 7 December 1799, leaving a widow and five children.<br>
<br>Meikle was a man of earnest religious feeling, and at the same time of great cheerfulness, a characteristic one would scarcely expect from the author of such works as &#145;The house of mourning&#146; and &#145;The monthly memorial, or, A periodical interview with the king of terrors&#146;. In 1797 he published a small volume entitled <span class="italic">Metaphysical Maxims</span>, which was reprinted in 1805 and 1807. In addition to his several published collections of religious writings, he left a large number of religious meditations in prose and verse, a selection from which was published by subscription for the benefit of his widow under the title of <span class="italic">The Select Remains</span> (1803), which contains both &#145;The house of mourning&#146; and &#145;The monthly memorial&#146;.<br>
