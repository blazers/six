<span class="headword">Hodgkinson,  George Christopher</span>  (1816&#150;1880), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and meteorologist</span>, was born at Newark, the son of George Hodgkinson, attorney, and his wife, Julia Beevor. From King Edward VI School, Louth, he went in 1833 as a pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA (fourteenth wrangler) in 1837 and MA in 1842. His first posts were as master at the King Edward VI Free School, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, then as principal of Hull College. He was ordained deacon in 1842, and priest in 1843. About 1845 he married Isabella Lydia Spencer, niece of Sir James Clark Ross; of the twelve children born to them, not all survived infancy. In January 1846 he was appointed principal of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, an unlikely choice, for despite having glowing references as a teacher Hodgkinson knew nothing of agriculture. His emphasis on theory caused friction and his demands for more staff took the college to the brink of financial ruin. He was dismissed in June 1847, after which he became principal of the Diocesan Training College, York, and, from 1864 to 1876, headmaster of his former school at Louth. Besides sermons and tracts Hodgkinson published in 1854, in reply to the archbishop of York and bishop of Ripon, his defence of the teaching of the diocesan college, and some pamphlets on the examinations for the Indian Civil Service, approving open competition.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic alpine climber, Hodgkinson was among those seeking to improve the mountain aneroid barometer so that it would function as an altimeter, but although he offered a reward through the Alpine Club, none of the London makers took this up. The Royal Society contributed towards the cost of apparatus with which Hodgkinson made a series of actinometrical observations on the summit of Mont Blanc in 1866. Using a lighter, less costly version of the Herschel actinometer, he corresponded with the astronomer royal as to the most effective mode of registering the amount and intensity of sunshine. He died at his home at Car Colston, Nottinghamshire, on 25 April 1880. He was survived by his wife.<br>
