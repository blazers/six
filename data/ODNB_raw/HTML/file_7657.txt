<span class="headword">Dillon,  John Blake</span>  (1814&#150;1866), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and journalist</span>, was born on 5 May 1814 in Ballaghaderreen, on the borders of Mayo and Roscommon, the fourth of seven children of Luke Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1825), farmer and shopkeeper, and his wife, Anne Blake, of Dunmacrina, co. Mayo. Dillon was educated at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (1830&#150;32), and Trinity College, Dublin (1834&#150;41). A prizewinner in political economy, he gained a BA in logic and ethics, and was called to the Irish bar. At Trinity College he made the most important friendship of his political career, with Thomas Davis, whom he succeeded as president of the Historical Society, the student debating forum. In 1842, Dillon, Davis, and Charles Gavan Duffy launched <span class="italic">Nation</span>, one of the most notable journalistic ventures in Irish history. Initially, the <i>Nation</i>, or Young Ireland, group supported O'Connell's repeal agitation, but as its hopes were not realized, they turned increasingly towards the romantic nationalism then sweeping through Europe.<br>
<br>Dillon married Adelaide Hart (1828&#150;1872), the daughter of a Dublin solicitor, in October 1847. In an unpublished memoir she described him as tall, &#145;dark as a Spaniard in complexion, with regular noble features and great melancholy eyes&#146;. He associated &#145;nearly all the sweet memories&#146; of his life with Druid Lodge, her home in Killiney, co. Dublin  (Dillon MSS, TCD: 26 June 1849); it became their home after 1856. It was a happy marriage but troubled by ill health, especially Adelaide's. They had eight children: five boys and three girls.<br>
<br>The Paris revolution of February 1848 raised unrealistic expectations in famine-stricken Ireland. With the suspension of habeas corpus on 22 July, Dillon and Thomas Francis Meagher persuaded William Smith O'Brien to lead an insurrection, which ended in failure one week later in co. Tipperary. In spite of a &pound;300 reward for his capture, Dillon escaped with the assistance of clerical friends to the United States. During his exile in New York he prospered as a lawyer. In the era of reaction which succeeded the year of revolutions in Europe, he went through a period of disillusionment with Irish politics and the Roman Catholic church. His perspective changed, however, after his wife induced him to return to Ireland in 1856, following an amnesty offered in the previous year.<br>
<br>Dillon was a liberal Catholic (among his papers in Trinity College is his translation of part of <span class="italic">Words of a Believer</span>, by Felicit&eacute; Lamennais). But in the last phase of his political career he formed the anti-Fenian National Association with the ultramontane archbishop of Dublin, Paul Cullen. The best explanation for this paradox is perhaps that they were both deeply religious men and, essentially, constitutional nationalists.<br>
<br>Dillon was elected MP for Tipperary in July 1865. He died suddenly of cholera in Killiney on 15 September 1866, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. According to Gavan Duffy, John Blake Dillon's &#145;generous nature made him more a philanthropist than a politician&#146;  (Duffy, <span class="italic">Young Ireland</span>, 1.38). During his brief parliamentary career, none the less, he made a decisive contribution to the Irish&#150;Liberal understanding which ushered in the great era of Gladstonian reform. Together with his wife, Adelaide, he founded a political dynasty: their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32831/', "John Dillon")</script> was a leading figure at Westminster for nearly forty years, and a grandson, James Mathew Dillon (1902&#150;1986), was a tribune of democracy in independent Ireland.<br>
