<span class="headword">Hamilton,  James  Stevenson-</span>  (1867&#150;1957), <span class="occ">wildlife conservationist in South Africa</span>, was born at 7 Cumberland Place, Dublin, on 2 October 1867, the eldest son and first of three children of James Stevenson (1838&#150;1926) of Braidwood, Lanarkshire, landowner and army officer, and his wife, Eliza Hamilton (1839&#150;1875), who in June 1867 inherited from her uncle Fairholm, a property near Larkhall, Lanarkshire. On their marriage her husband adopted her surname in addition to his own (although he reverted to Stevenson in 1893). On Eliza Stevenson-Hamilton's death her son became sixteenth laird and heir to Fairholm, which was his lifelong home, although he never lived there permanently as an adult. His father twice remarried, in 1879 and 1885, and had further children. The complex family dynamics that resulted from his father's unhappy third marriage were unsettling, but throughout his life Stevenson-Hamilton remained intensely loyal to his father, to his siblings, and to the heritage of Fairholm.<br>
<br>Intending to follow his father and paternal uncles in a military career, Stevenson-Hamilton was educated at Locker's Park, Hemel Hempstead (1879&#150;1880), and at Rugby School (1881&#150;3). Having completed his training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1888, he was gazetted into the 6th Inniskilling dragoons and posted to the garrison in Pietermaritzburg, Natal. After his regiment returned to Britain in 1890 he became bored with the peacetime cavalry routine. In 1898 he took leave of absence to join Major A. St Hill Gibbons on an expedition to Barotseland to determine the navigability of the Zambezi River and to evaluate possibilities for white settlement in the region. In December 1899 he rejoined his regiment to fight in the South African War. Initially enthusiastic and in a position to display his qualities of leadership and military competence, he became increasingly critical of the conduct of the war.<br>
<br>When war ended in 1902 Stevenson-Hamilton left the army and accepted employment in the Transvaal colony as warden of the Sabi game reserve that had been established in 1898 between the Sabi and Crocodile rivers. He found his life's work in enlarging and transforming this small game reserve into the Kruger National Park, an internationally renowned wildlife sanctuary. The aims of game reserves at that time were to prevent poaching, to eradicate a wide range of &#145;vermin&#146; species (including lion, leopard, cheetah, and wild dog) and to nurture antelope and buffalo herds for the pleasure of sport-hunters. With his innovative leadership, Stevenson-Hamilton's accomplishment was to found an African national park that was both ecologically sound and receptive of visitors. He laid the foundations of South African nature conservation by initiating an effective paramilitary bureaucracy, careful formalized reporting, and a close personal knowledge of the people, landscape, and wildlife of the area. Initially he evicted all Africans from the game reserve. This earned him the name of Skukuza (&#145;he who sweeps clean&#146;) but he later came to value the labour that black people could provide. He greatly expanded his area of control northwards by incorporating privately owned land up to the Olifants River and by taking over control of the Singwitsi, a game reserve established in 1903 between the Letaba and Levuvhu rivers.<br>
<br>Stevenson-Hamilton publicized the value of wildlife protection by writing promotional and educational material in a number of books and journals. <span class="italic">Animal Life in Africa</span>, published in 1912, is a forerunner of modern animal behavioural ecology. Stevenson-Hamilton brought South African wildlife protection to international attention. An active member of the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire, he corresponded regularly with such eminent sportsman&#150;preservationists as Frederick Selous, Abel Chapman, William Hornaday, and Theodore Roosevelt.<br>
<br>Stevenson-Hamilton enlisted in the First World War and was stationed in Gallipoli and Egypt. Between January 1917 and December 1919 he was seconded to a civilian administrative post in the southern Sudan. For a short period in 1921&#150;2 he was appointed superintendent of the game preservation department for the Sudan.<br>
<br>From time to time political developments threatened the continuing existence of the game reserves in South Africa. Stevenson-Hamilton lobbied for the creation of a national park that would be secured by an act of parliament. He found allies in Jan Smuts, who later became prime minister of the Union of South Africa, and Deneys Reitz, the minister of lands, and he warded off the land hunger of the departments of mines, agriculture, and native affairs. In 1923 national park legislation was due to come before the South African parliament, but private landowners delayed expropriation, and a general election in 1924 brought a change of government. However, the incoming National Party government also supported the initiative, seeing in it the opportunity to promote Afrikaner culture. The national park became linked to a Dutch settler heritage and anti-British values, which at the time also found expression in a new national flag and anthem. Thus, when the <span class="roman">National Parks Act</span> was passed in 1926, the park was named after Paul Kruger, former president of the old Transvaal republic. Stevenson-Hamilton considered retirement and accepted a temporary position in London as secretary of the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire, but disliked the job.<br>
<br>Stevenson-Hamilton returned to South Africa in 1926, becoming warden of the Kruger National Park, a position he held until his retirement in 1946. He managed the process of turning the game reserves into a national park that was attractive to tourists. Moreover, he transformed the conservation ethic by emphasizing the intrinsic value of the natural world and he ended &#145;vermin&#146; killing. Increasingly, however, he resented interference by the expanding bureaucracy that managed the growing number of South African national parks. He also felt politically alienated, and disagreed with the preferential employment of Afrikaners and the philosophy of apartheid. Once he had retired his successors minimized his contribution to the Kruger National Park while extolling that of Afrikaners. Respected more by English-speaking South Africans, he was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of the Witwatersrand in 1935 and by the University of Cape Town in 1945.<br>
<br>On 13 August 1930 Stevenson-Hamilton married Hilda Margaret Cholmondeley (1901&#150;1979), an accomplished painter and photographer; they had three children, Margaret (1931&#150;1935), James (<i>b</i>. 1933), and Ann (<i>b</i>. 1935). He died at Gibraltar, White River, Cape Province, South Africa, on 10 December 1957. His ashes were scattered in the Kruger National Park, where his legacy endures.<br>
