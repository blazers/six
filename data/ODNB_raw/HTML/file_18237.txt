<span class="headword">Martin <span class="st"> [Martyn]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1520/21&#150;1592/3), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and polemicist</span>, the son of John Martin of Cerne, Dorset, was educated at Winchester (admitted 1533, aged twelve) and New College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow in 1540, and subsequently (<i>c</i>.1550) at Bourges University in France. Martin's engagement in anti-evangelical polemic in the reign of Mary I created the opportunity for protestant propagandists such as John Ponet and John Bale to blacken his reputation, and it is to them that allegations of Martin's scandalous lifestyle, academic improprieties, and vacillating views on such controversial issues as clerical celibacy at Bourges can be traced. At the accession of Queen Mary he returned to England from studies in Paris and entered the service of the new lord chancellor, Stephen Gardiner, for whom he became an active administrator, first as an official in the archdeaconry of Berkshire and subsequently as chancellor of the diocese of Winchester. Although Martin originally sat in the parliament of 1553 as MP for the borough of Saltash, Cornwall, Gardiner's patronage ensured that he was subsequently returned as member for the Wiltshire borough of Hindon. After Gardiner's death in 1555, the warden of Winchester, John White, helped him secure the Wiltshire seat of Ludgershall. He also enjoyed an active diplomatic career, narrowly failing to become ambassador to France in 1556, but none the less engaging in negotiations with Philip II over the projected marriage of Princess Elizabeth and over trading relations between the Merchant Adventurers and the Netherlands. It was, however, Martin's rapid advancement in the law that most distinguished his career. Having graduated DCL at Oxford in 1555, he became master of requests by 1556, and master in chancery by 1557. He held the protonotaryship of chancery (1557&#150;60), but lost the office at the accession of Elizabeth despite his willingness to swear the oath of supremacy.<br>
<br>Martin's enthusiasm for Marian policy found particular expression in his <span class="italic">Traictise Declarying &hellip; that the Pretensed Marriage of Priests &hellip; is No Mariage</span> (published in May 1554), a defence of the regime's reintroduction of clerical celibacy in which Gardiner himself probably also had a hand. Although Ponet, one of the great apologists for clerical marriage, replied from exile, Martin's work proved sufficiently popular for Robert Caley to seek a monopoly of printing it in 1558, although when Ponet's response was posthumously published in 1566 Martin declined to prolong the exchange.<br>
<br>Martin's career in royal service reached its apogee in September 1555, when he was entrusted by the council with the prosecution of heretics, ultimately serving alongside Bishop Brooks of Gloucester and his fellow civil lawyers John Story and David Lewis as royal proctor at the trial of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Accounts of the trial reveal the shrewdness of Martin's opening address on the relationship between the secular and ecclesiastical power, a strategy that exposed one of Cranmer's points of weakness. He was equally ruthless in pressing the archbishop on whether all oaths, good or bad, ought to be obeyed; on his changing belief on the eucharist; and on the history of the supreme headship of the church, issues over which he succeeded in flustering the otherwise dignified Cranmer. That Martin provided the real teeth of the prosecution is implied both by Cranmer's choice of him as a conduit for a letter of appeal to the queen (subsequently published in Emden in 1556) and by her consultation of him as to whether she should even read it. Such zeal in the Catholic cause rendered him obnoxious to the protestant party, and accounts for his disappearance from public office under Elizabeth. Although he remained a Catholic, Martin none the less continued to work as a civil lawyer into the 1590s, being frequently involved in appeals from the prerogative court of Canterbury and the courts of admiralty and arches.<br>
<br>Martin was twice married; first, by January 1555, to Mary, daughter of John Roys of London, with whom he had two sons and one daughter; and second, some time after 1565, to Margery, widow of William Denton of Southwark, with whom he had one daughter. His estates in Steeple Mordern, Cambridgeshire, Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire, and London were subject to litigation in requests shortly before his death. He was still alive in March 1592. Thomas, his son and the executor of his will (proved 7 August 1593), subsequently sued his stepmother and half-sister in chancery to obtain the administration of his estate.<br>
