<span class="headword">Lawrenson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Molyneux]</span>,  Mary Ann</span>  (1850&#150;1943), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and educationist</span>, was born on 23 March 1850 at 49 Castle Street East, Marylebone, Middlesex, the eldest of eleven children of John Molyneux, printer, trade unionist, and co-operative movement activist, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keys. After moving to Woolwich in 1862, Molyneux did printing work for local organizations including the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS). This contact with working-class initiatives shaped his daughter's social and intellectual development. She also inherited from her father a faith in the somewhat unusual combination of Roman Catholicism and Christian socialism. From 1869 she taught English in several schools, including a spell in Paris. On returning to Woolwich in 1876 she married John Marcus Lawrenson, a government clerk and auditor for the RACS, with whom she had one son.<br>
<br>In February 1883 Mary Lawrenson responded to Alice Acland's suggestion in the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span> that a women's co-operative league be formed. Lawrenson advocated a national organization to co-ordinate local branches which would themselves assist co-operative extension and promote female educational and social development. For this, and her role in framing its constitution, she deserves recognition with Acland as a co-founder of the Women's Co-operative Guild.<br>
<br>Lawrenson established a guild branch in Woolwich, the second of three founded nationally during 1883, and joined the first national guild central committee in 1884. She was also elected to the education committee of the RACS in 1884, when female participation in co-operative management remained rare. She organized classes for women and a juvenile guild for children. However, her educational and charitable agenda and her advocacy of productive workshops were at odds with &#145;progressive&#146; elements in Woolwich, who sought links with the labour movement and campaigners for women's suffrage. Hence she resigned as Woolwich Guild secretary in 1885 and from the education committee in 1888. Her subsequent involvement with the RACS was limited, although she returned to the education committee in 1895&#150;8 and 1902&#150;5.<br>
<br>Lawrenson assumed national office as guild general secretary in 1885&#150;9. An accomplished speaker, she travelled widely, promoting new and established guild branches. The increase in guild branches to fifty-one by 1889 prompted Lawrenson's suggestion of regional co-ordination, a system implemented after her departure as secretary. Lawrenson resented the termination of her office in that year. The secretaryship passed to Margaret Llewelyn Davies, ostensibly because she was thought better placed to carry the administrative burden created by the expanding guild; but Lawrenson was also seen as too independent in her Christian socialism, particularly her enthusiasm for co-operative workshops and labour co-partnerships. She lost her place on the guild's central committee in 1893, but her service on the southern sectional board of the Co-operative Union in 1893&#150;4 and 1896&#150;8 breached another male bastion. She was also the first female member of a national co-operative committee, through her place on the union's central board.<br>
<br>In 1905 Lawrenson moved to Bournemouth, where she was active in the local guild. After her husband's death during the First World War she withdrew from co-operative work. Latterly she lived quietly in Brighton with her son. The guild leadership still regarded her as a maverick, and initially resisted her nomination for the freedom of the guild in 1931. She was, however, f&ecirc;ted at the guild's jubilee celebrations in 1933, and both the guild and the RACS supported Lawrenson financially in old age. Bedridden in her final years, Lawrenson died at the Brighton Municipal Hospital on 1 January 1943. Her funeral on 7 January at St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Brighton, and burial in the borough cemetery were attended by numerous guild representatives.<br>
<br>Mary Lawrenson was somewhat isolated in the co-operative movement, both as a woman in a male-dominated movement and in her faith in co-operative production amid advocates of consumers' interests. She was a determined champion of education, Christian socialism, and improvements in women's daily lives. The women's guild which she helped establish was a pioneer among organizations to give a public role and voice to working-class women.<br>
