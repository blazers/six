<span class="headword">Davis,  William</span>  (1812&#150;1873), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Dublin in August 1812, the son of a solicitor. His family was socially well connected, but found themselves in reduced circumstances. He first intended to train for the law, but later turned to art, attending drawing and modelling lessons at the Royal Dublin Society. In 1833&#150;5 he exhibited portraits at the Royal Hibernian Academy. In 1837 he moved to England, living first in Sheffield and settling in Liverpool about five years later. He enrolled as a probationer in the Liverpool Academy Schools in 1846 and as a student in 1848. He was elected an associate of the same institution in 1851 and a full member in 1853. Between 1856 and 1859 he served as professor of drawing at the Liverpool Academy. Davis maintained his connection with the Liverpool Academy until its final dissolution in 1867. He sent works to exhibitions from a succession of addresses in Liverpool, until 1863 when he used addresses in London. By 1870 he was permanently settled in South Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>William Davis's first patron was John Miller, merchant and shipowner in Liverpool, who had in his collection distinguished Pre-Raphaelite paintings including works by Millais, Ford Madox Brown, and Holman Hunt. H. C. Marillier believed that Miller encouraged Davis to abandon figure painting in favour of landscape. The Liverpool artist Robert Tonge (1823&#150;1856) seems also to have led Davis towards pure landscape subjects. In 1853 the two shared a painting expedition to Ireland, where Davis met his wife.<br>
<br>Davis found his landscape subjects in the countryside around Liverpool, on the Wirral peninsula, and on the north shore of the Mersey towards Runcorn. On occasions he ventured further afield into Cheshire and north Wales, and he also painted on the island of Bute in Scotland, where John Miller had a house. Among his early works as a landscape painter is <span class="italic">Bidston Moss at Wallasey</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), of 1855, showing a view westwards from the Wirral across the Dee estuary towards the Flintshire coast. Davis returned to Ireland in 1857, and it was perhaps on this occasion that he painted <span class="italic">Rye Water Near Leixlip, County Kildare</span> (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin).<br>
<br>Davis exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1851, in the first place showing still lifes. In 1855 he sent a landscape painting&#151;a view in Cheshire entitled <span class="italic">Early Spring Evening</span>&#151;a work that caught the eye of D. G. Rossetti, who mentioned it in a letter to William Allingham as one of &#145;the four best landscapes in the place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</span>, 1.252). Rossetti also drew Ruskin's attention to Davis's painting. In a first reference to <span class="italic">Early Spring Evening</span> in a supplement to the 1855 <span class="italic">Academy Notes</span> Ruskin explained that &#145;my friend [had said that] it contains the &#147;unity of perfect truth with invention&#148;&#146;, but subsequently he gave a more qualified account of the painting, judging it as &#145;merely good Pre-Raphaelite work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 14.30, 32).<br>
<br>That Davis's landscapes were particularly admired by fellow artists is demonstrated by Ford Madox Brown's rapturous comments on <span class="italic">Wallasey Mill, Cheshire</span>, shown at the 1856 Royal Academy, as a painting of &#145;leefless [<i>sic</i>] trees &amp; some ducks which is perfection&#146;. He went on: &#145;I do not remember ever seeing such an english landscape, it is far too good to be understood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 175). In September 1856 Brown met Davis at John Miller's house in Liverpool, describing him as &#145;one of the most unlucky artists in England &hellip; crushed by disappointment &amp; conscious dependency of Millar [<i>sic</i>] who has entirely kept him for years&#146;  (ibid., 190). In 1873 Davis's obituarist in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (probably F. G. Stephens) wrote of him: &#145;No man saw further than Mr Davis into the opportunities of a quiet rural subject: a hedge, a stream, a drenched autumnal pasture, a flitting of light and shadow over an English sky&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>).<br>
<br>In 1857 Davis sent six works to the Russell Place exhibition of Pre-Raphaelite art, the titles of which indicate that they were landscapes and paintings of animals. Ruskin saw these and took it upon himself to give advice. In a letter which was apparently never sent, Ruskin told Davis to treat landscapes with more prominent subjects and with more obvious associations: &#145;Your work &hellip; cannot become popular unless you choose subjects of greater interest.&#146; (Ruskin had taken particular exception to a painting of Davis's that he described as &#145;that &#147;ditch and wheatfield&#148;&#146;.) Furthermore, Ruskin felt that Davis was too dependent on a technique of allowing oil colour, opaque as well as loosely diluted with glazes, to mix and coalesce over a ground of pure flake white. This was the method by which Davis and his contemporaries in Liverpool achieved effects of dense texture and vibrant colour, but Ruskin warned against &#145;too great trust to the liquidity of the vehicle in blending your colours&#146;. He explained: &#145;Good use has been made of this quality by the masters of the Pre-Raphaelite school, but it is a dangerous temptation: the highest results in oil-painting depend on judicious and powerful use of dryer, in no wise <i>floating</i> colour&#146;  (Rossetti, <span class="italic">Ruskin</span>, 169&#150;70).<br>
<br>Davis operated on the fringe of the Pre-Raphaelite circle, and as such participated in the American travelling exhibition of Pre-Raphaelite art in 1857&#150;8 and in 1858 was invited as one of a group of Liverpool painters to join the Hogarth Club. A total of sixteen paintings by him were shown at the Royal Academy, the last in 1872, but according to Marillier the selectors turned many others of his works away. A painting entitled <span class="italic">Harrowing</span>, shown first in Liverpool in 1859 but later rejected at the Royal Academy, was exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition in London and described by W. M. Rossetti in his review of the exhibition as &#145;profoundly actual in its broadly realized facts, and poetical in its impression and suggestiveness&#146;  (Rossetti, <span class="italic">Fine Art</span>, 160).<br>
<br>Like J. W. Inchbold, Davis worked slowly and struggled to sell his paintings. William Michael Rossetti described him as a &#145;modest hard-working man, and an artist of uncommon gifts&#146;. Rossetti further observed that Davis was &#145;greatly admired in a circle too strictly limited. He had a large family, and always found difficulty in &#147;making the two ends meet&#148;&#146;  (Rossetti, <span class="italic">Ruskin</span>, 168). He compounded his problems by consistently refusing commissions from dealers. Gradually, however, his work came to be appreciated by certain Pre-Raphaelite collectors, including George Rae and Joseph Beausire, both of Liverpool, James Leathart of Gateshead, and Humphrey Roberts of London.<br>
<br>In his last years Davis suffered from angina. He died in London on 22 April 1873, it was said as a result of the nervous strain brought on by seeing two of his paintings badly hung at the 1873 International Exhibition. A memorial exhibition was organized by Ford Madox Brown to raise an annuity to support his widow. Two of Davis's sons, Valentine (1854&#150;1930) and Lucien (1860&#150;1951), followed him in becoming painters.<br>
