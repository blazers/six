<span class="headword">La Mothe,  Claude Groteste  de</span>  (1647&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Reformed minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Orl&eacute;ans, France, the second of four sons of Jacques Groteste, sieur de la Buffi&egrave;re (<i>d</i>. in or after 1685), advocate of the Paris <i>parlement</i> and elder of the Reformed church at Charenton, and of his wife, Anne Groteste du Chesnay. Like his brothers he took the title of a family property, in his case that of La Mothe. Having gained a doctorate in law from the University of Orl&eacute;ans in 1664, the following year he was received as an advocate by the Paris <i>parlement</i>. After theological study, in 1675 he became minister of the protestant church at Lisy-sur-Orcq, near Meaux, in the &Icirc;le-de-France. By contract dated from Paris on 23 June 1679 he married Marie (<i>d</i>. 1726/7), daughter of Jean Berthe, a Parisian banker, and his wife, Suzanne Marchand; the bride brought a dowry of 36,000 livres. Called in 1682 to the wealthier and more prestigious church at Rouen, Groteste de La Mothe entered into the charge there, but when the vacancy at Lisy proved impossible to fill he returned to his original post. When the last protestant provincial synod was held at Lisy in August 1683, he acted as clerk and gained general approval for his wisdom.<br>
<br>That year, in what was celebrated by the Jesuits as a significant coup, Groteste de La Mothe's brother Marin Groteste, sieur des Mahis (1649&#150;1694), abjured his protestantism; in time he became a Catholic priest and apologist. Subsequently his parents and youngest brother, Abraham, also converted. However, with the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, Groteste de La Mothe and his wife were granted permission to leave France, taking some of their substantial property (perhaps as much as 60,000 livres), while the rest was confiscated or entrusted to relatives. By 23 November they were in London. Here in 1686 Groteste became minister of the conformist French church at St Martin Orgar; he was naturalized on 16 December 1687. He transferred to the linked churches of Swallow Street in 1689 and Hungerford Market and le Quarr&eacute; in 1690; by September that year he seems to have been acting as secretary of a nascent association of refugee ministers in London. By this time he habitually signed himself C. G. de La Mothe.<br>
<br>In 1691 La Mothe also became a chaplain to the duke of Schomberg. In this capacity, and as spokesman of the ministers' conference, he wrote in French a work translated as <span class="italic">Two Discourses Concerning the Divinity of our Saviour</span> (1693), an assertion of their collective orthodoxy on this point and a firm rejection of the Socinian position of which they had been suspected. Stephen Nye in <span class="italic">Reflections upon Two Discourses</span> (1693) mocked him as &#145;an eminent Demagogue of the French Nation&#146;, and the &#145;Refugees for Conscience&#146; in general as uncomprehending &#145;Informers and Persecutors&#146;, vainly trying to influence the English bishops and law courts, but La Mothe was undaunted  (pp. 3, 21). His <span class="italic">The Inspiration of the New Testament Asserted</span> (1694) was located in a well-tilled area of apologetics, but he considered there was still scope to counter &#145;Libertinism&#146; with a more thoroughgoing exposition of the divine inspiration of scripture. That February his colleagues at the four conjoined churches noted that, without their consent, La Mothe had accepted a call to the chief conformist French church at the Savoy; he apparently suffered no lasting resentment, and was to remain there for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>La Mothe, whose well-connected relatives included his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23821/', "Jean or John Robethon")</script>, secretary to William of Orange since before 1688 and later a servant of George I as elector and king, was in contact through correspondence with men of influence in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Combining pre-eminence among the French pastors and friendship with Englishmen of varying shades of political opinion, including the whiggish Archbishop Thomas Tenison, the tory Francis Atterbury, and the suspected Jacobite George Smalridge, he became a bridge between the Anglican establishment and other European protestants. Having collected quotations from sermons preached by English clergy in support of Queen Anne's appeal of 1703 on behalf of protestant refugees from the new French province of Orange, he published them at The Hague as a demonstration of Anglican charity. <span class="italic">Correspondance fraternelle de l'&eacute;glise anglicane avec les autres &eacute;glises r&eacute;form&eacute;es et &eacute;trang&egrave;res</span> (1705) claimed a close relationship between the Church of England and the continental Reformed churches. La Mothe's criticism of high-churchmen who through their &#145;rigidity&#146; refused to acknowledge this provoked a backlash, which in turn prompted him to publish the much more ambitious <span class="italic">Entretiens sur la correspondance fraternelle</span> (1707). This traced a flourishing partnership since the Reformation, which had cooled only in the days of Archbishop Laud; taking up the mantle of the founder minister and apologist of the Savoy, Jean Durel, he appended letters from Geneva and elsewhere approving both the church and episcopacy.<br>
<br>In April 1706 and December 1707 respectively, La Mothe became the first naturalized Englishman to be elected to the newly founded Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Actively involved in both, he channelled donations from his own community, organized relief for persecuted Vaudois protestants and French versions of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> for Huguenots in North America, and helped examine potential missionaries. He proclaimed to foreigners the worth of the SPG in <span class="italic">Relation de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tablie pour la Propagation de l'&Eacute;vangile</span> (1708), a translation of White Kennett's 1706 work accompanied by sermons of his own. Applauding recent British initiatives such as charity schools and parish libraries, it called on all protestants to join in the formidable task of converting the nations. In April 1708 the SPCK in its turn formally thanked La Mothe for his <span class="italic">Caract&egrave;res des nouvelles proph&eacute;cies</span> (1708), four sermons exposing the so-called C&eacute;venol or French Prophets. When these three exiled leaders of an unsuccessful protestant rising had arrived in London in 1707 and solicited political support through the medium of &#145;divinely inspired&#146; warnings, the Savoy and Threadneedle Street churches had united to dissociate themselves from co-religionists who were undermining their credibility. In his <span class="italic">Nouveaux m&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire des trois Camisars</span> (1708) La Mothe offered the evidence they had collected for the &#145;fraud&#146;, which he perceived as favoured by Socinians and infiltrated by papists. The latter were the target of his <span class="italic">Politique du papisme en Angleterre</span>, published at Rotterdam the following year. Convinced that England was the primary target of Rome's onslaught on the Reformed, he decried what he saw as a fifth column sowing division between the Anglicans and their brethren, and between the French refugees and their hosts; in response he proposed a society dedicated to combating Catholicism. La Mothe consistently regarded Lutherans as partners of the Reformed. When the conversion and subsequent marriage of Elizabeth Christine of Wolfenb&uuml;ttel to Charles III of Spain tarred them with popery, La Mothe gained the gratitude of Tenison and other supporters of the Hanoverian succession with his well-researched defence of Lutheran conduct, <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires de la pr&eacute;tendue d&eacute;claration de l'Universit&eacute; de Helmstad</span> (1710). In the final years of his life he collected material for another apology for his adopted church and country, <span class="italic">Charitas Anglicana</span>, but it is unclear where and when it was published.<br>
<br>In 1712 La Mothe was elected a member of the Royal Society of Berlin. In July 1713, in collaboration with Henri de Massue de Ruvigny, earl of Galway, he was busy collecting funds for Huguenots released from the galleys. However, in his last years he was overtaken by a long and serious illness. Being &#145;within two fingers of death&#146; concentrated his mind on the duties of the suffering and recovering believer, laid out during a brief respite in <span class="italic">Les devoirs du chr&eacute;tien convalescent</span> (1713). His will, made on 3 September 1713 from Chelsea, made no reference to his physical condition but gave evidence of his varied interests and connections. Beneficiaries included the French church at the Savoy, the charity house in Soho, the SPG, &#145;the society which meets at Mr Shute's, minister, in Bartlet Buildings&#146;, and a cousin in the Netherlands. Apart from Madame La Mothe's, the largest bequests were to his eldest brother, Jacques Groteste, sieur de la Buffi&egrave;re (whose financial sufferings and insecurity as a protestant remaining in France feature in surviving correspondence), his youngest brother, Abraham (whose Catholicism had not impaired good relations), and his nephew Robethon, then in Brunswick. La Mothe died on 30 September 1713 and was probably buried at the Savoy Chapel, Westminster. Condolences from many quarters reached his widow and executor. Until her death, between late October 1726 and early January 1727, she continued to correspond with family and friends abroad; many of the couple's letters (those from 1703 written to and from a house in St Martin's Lane, Westminster, &#145;by the French pewterer's&#146;) survive among the papers of La Mothe's colleague at the Savoy, Israel Antoine Aufr&egrave;re, deposited at the Huguenot Library, London.<br>
