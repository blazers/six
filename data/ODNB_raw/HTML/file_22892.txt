<span class="headword">Punshon,  William Morley</span>  (1824&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and public lecturer</span>, born at Doncaster on 29 May 1824, was the only child of John Punshon (1793&#150;1840) and his wife, Elizabeth (1800&#150;1838), who married in 1823 at Cantley, near Doncaster. His father was a member of the firm of Wilton and Punshon, mercers, at Doncaster. His mother was the eldest daughter of William Morley, a freeman of the same town. His maternal uncle Isaac was knighted in 1841, and was twice mayor of Doncaster. William Punshon was taught at Doncaster grammar school, and afterwards at a boarding-school at Tadcaster. In 1837 he entered his grandfather Morley's counting-house in Hull, and began to learn the business of a timber merchant. He employed his leisure time in reading.<br>
<br>His mother's death, and the influence of the Revd Samuel Romilly Hall, led Punshon to consider religious questions; he was converted and joined the Methodist society in Hull in May 1839. At the age of sixteen he began to preach, his first sermon being at Ellerby, near Hull. With like-minded friends he formed a society for mutual improvement, and soon displayed remarkable powers of oratory. In 1840 he moved to Sunderland, the place of origin of his father, where he had work with an uncle by marriage and became an accredited local preacher. Abandoning business pursuits, he prepared for the work of the Wesleyan Methodist ministry under his uncle the Revd Benjamin Clough, in Woolwich. After spending four months at the theological college at Richmond, he was sent into circuit work early in 1845; two years of probation were passed in Whitehaven and two more in Carlisle. Ordained at the Manchester conference of 1849, he spent three years in each of Newcastle upon Tyne, Sheffield, and Leeds. From 1858 to 1864 he was stationed in London (Hinde Street and Islington circuits); subsequently, until 1867, he was in Bristol.<br>
<br>After his ordination Punshon married, on 22 August 1849, Maria Ann Vickers of Gateshead. She died in 1858, leaving him in a depressed state of health. This, and his decision to marry her sister Fanny, occasioned a removal from Britain to Canada, where such a marriage was legally possible, turning his back, it seemed, on a promising career in British Methodism. They were married on 15 August 1868, but Fanny died in 1870. In the five years Punshon spent in Canada, he presided over each annual conference, and helped to consolidate the Methodists of the dominion in the wake of confederation. He was fraternal delegate of the British conference to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church in the United States in 1868 and 1872. In June 1872 the Victoria University of Cobourg, Canada, conferred on him the degree of LLD.<br>
<br>Punshon returned to England in 1873, and was married a third time, on 17 June of that year, to Mary, daughter of William Foster of Sheffield. He lived in London until his death&#151;for two years as superintendent of Kensington circuit, and from 1875 as one of the general secretaries of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society.<br>
<br>Punshon's refinement and eloquence gained for him a reputation, not only among the Methodists but with the general public, as one of the greatest pulpit orators of his age. His lectures covered the prophet of Horeb; John Bunyan; the Huguenots; Wilberforce; science, religion, and literature; and Daniel in Babylon. Delivered with a powerful voice, animated action, and rich rhetoric to crowds at the Exeter, St James's, and other halls in London, and to delighted audiences in the provinces, they greatly enhanced his popularity. Through his efforts he raised more than &pound;10,000 to support the building of churches in watering places such as Bournemouth, where a memorial chapel bearing his name was erected, and in London. His lecture on the Huguenots raised more than &pound;1000 for the chapel at Spitalfields. After his death the lectures were published.<br>
<br>Punshon also developed a great administrative talent. At the Manchester conference, July 1859, he was elected into the legal hundred, a rare distinction for one so young. Despite his absence in Canada he was elected president of conference on his return in 1874. To the mission cause at home and overseas Punshon devoted great energy throughout his life. He took a prominent part in the jubilee celebrations of missions in 1863. He also published a popular imitation of Keble's <span class="italic">Christian Year</span> entitled <span class="italic">Sabbath Chimes, or, Meditations in Verse</span>, in 1867. His last years were spent in presenting and enforcing the claims of the work of the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, in superintending the society's missions, in administering its funds, and in directing its agents. He died at Tranby, Brixton Rise, London, on 14 April 1881, and was buried in Norwood cemetery five days later. Punshon had four children, and was survived by his third wife.<br>
