<span class="headword">Kinloch,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1582), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of unknown parentage. Nothing certain is known of his life, although he has been plausibly identified as a musician within the circle of James Lauder, himself a musician in the service of Mary, queen of Scots, and later of James VI. Lauder retained a pension from the imprisoned queen, for whom his son John also worked. In a letter dated 2 October 1582 Lauder reports to his son that his daggers and knives will be sent by &#145;Mr. William Kynlowgch&#146; on his next journey from Scotland to London. None of Kinloch's extant music, all of which is for keyboard instruments, bears any indication of Catholic sympathies, but the letter conveniently documents a pattern of life that would explain its preservation in an English as well as in a Scottish manuscript.<br>
<br>The Scottish manuscript is that known as Duncan Burnett's manuscript (NL Scot., MS 9447, formerly Panmure 10 in the collection of the earl of Dalhousie), copied about 1600&#150;10. Five out of twenty-three keyboard pieces are here attributed to Kinloch (or Kinloche, with the first name variously spelt), though it seems certain that he wrote several of the others as well. It is clear from these that Kinloch was something of a virtuoso player. &#145;The Batell of Pavie&#146; is a technically demanding setting of a tune long popular on the continent. The &#145;fantassie&#146;, which is mainly an exercise in complex rhythms in the manner of some of William Byrd's fantasias, opens with a lengthy passage for crossed hands.<br>
<br>The English source of Kinloch's music is BL, Add. MS 30485 (<i>c</i>.1600), a manuscript associated with and partly written by the composer Thomas Weelkes. Here he is identified simply as &#145;kinloughe&#146;, the composer of a pavan and galliard. There can be no doubt that this is the work of the same composer: the general style is very similar, and, moreover, there exists in the London manuscript an anonymous &#145;Quadran&#146; pavan and galliard which bears a close musical relationship with &#145;the quadrant paven&#146; and its associated &#145;gaillart&#146; in the Duncan Burnett manuscript.<br>
<br>Unfortunately Kinloch's music has none of the distinctive features that might otherwise identify it as Scottish: its principles of composition are those of the Elizabethan and Jacobean virginalists, several of whom wrote music of equal or greater difficulty. It has been conjectured that he also composed some of the anonymous secular vocal music that survives in Scottish sources of the time, but this remains to be demonstrated convincingly.<br>
