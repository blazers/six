<span class="headword">Thomas,  Francis Sheppard</span>  (1793/4&#150;1857), <span class="occ">secretary of the Public Record Office</span>, was born at Kington, Herefordshire, where he was baptized on 23 February 1794, the son of Samuel Thomas and his wife, Elizabeth. He entered the State Paper Office as a clerk in 1826, and became a much valued secretary for records business to Lord Langdale, master of the rolls. From 1838 to 1857 he was secretary of the Public Record Office. After Langdale's death in 1851 Thomas's special influence, which had led to friction with the head of the office, diminished when Sir John Romilly, the new master of the rolls, preferred to deal with Treasury communications on records matters directly with the deputy keeper rather than through the secretary.<br>
<br>In 1846 Thomas privately printed a compilation from public records entitled <span class="italic">Notes of Materials for the History of Public Departments</span>. This was followed in 1848 by a short but more elaborate work on <span class="italic">The ancient exchequer of England, the Treasury, and origin of the present management of the exchequer and treasury of Ireland</span>, and in 1849 by <span class="italic">A History of the State Paper Office</span>, which expanded the account given in his earlier <span class="italic">Notes</span>. In 1852 he wrote an explanatory preface to <span class="italic">Liber munerum publicorum Hiberniae</span>, by Rowley Lascelles. In 1853 his <span class="italic">Hand-Book to the Public Records</span> appeared. It was a novel summary and the first of a succession of general guides by later generations of Public Record Office officials. Thomas's <span class="italic">Hand-Book</span> appears to have been written largely in his own time; its usefulness to the department, and that of his previous <span class="italic">Notes</span>, helped to secure him an enhancement of salary in 1855. Three volumes of <span class="italic">Historical Notes, 1509&#150;1714</span> followed in 1856. These are mainly biographical and chronological memoranda, assembled over many years of work on the historical side of the office, set down to assist colleagues then arranging the state papers. They were published under government direction &#145;rather than at the wish of the compiler&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas was married to Mary, sister of Charles Lechmere, sometime deputy keeper of state papers. They had a son, Francis Charles, who received a clerical appointment at the Public Record Office but who died aged thirty in 1870. Thomas died at his home, Broad Green, Croydon, on 27 August 1857, and was buried in the Anglican catacombs, Norwood cemetery.<br>
