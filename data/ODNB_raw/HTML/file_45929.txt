<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heathcote, Sir  William</span>, fifth baronet  (1801&#150;1881), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 17 May 1801, the only son of William Heathcote (1772&#150;1802) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Lovelace Bigg Wither of Manydown, near Basingstoke. His father was rector of Worting, near Basingstoke, and prebendary of Winchester. Heathcote was educated at Winchester College and Oriel College, Oxford, at which he graduated on 29 November 1821, with a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, John Keble being his tutor. He was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, from November 1822 to 1825 (having failed to be elected in 1821), becoming bachelor of civil law in 1824; he was, with Gladstone, one of its first honorary fellows in 1858. He prepared himself for the bar, but on 22 February 1825 he succeeded his uncle, Sir Thomas Heathcote, as fifth baronet and as owner of Hursley Park, Hampshire, a modest estate whose wealth came from supplying wood to the navy, a declining source as iron replaced oak in shipbuilding. On 8 November 1825 he married Caroline Perceval, youngest daughter of Lord Arden, and brother of Heathcote's schoolfriend, Arthur Perceval. She died, following a minor operation, in 1835, leaving him with three sons and a daughter. On 18 May 1841 he married Selina (<i>d</i>. 1901), eldest daughter of Evelyn Shirley of Eatington, Warwickshire; her good cheer and energy balanced her husband's pessimism and frequent illnesses; to Gladstone he &#145;always appeared unusually collected and ripe for death&#146;  (&#145;Diaries&#146;, 10.113). They had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>From his undergraduate days, Heathcote was much influenced by Keble, whom he invited to become curate at Hursley in 1825; but Keble had to retire in 1826 for domestic reasons. In 1829 he unsuccessfully invited Keble to become vicar of Hursley and in 1836 secured his acceptance. Heathcote restored Hursley church on Tractarian principles and introduced a set of religious rules for his household. He shared Keble's loyalty to Anglicanism and his distrust of continental Catholicism. Keble somewhat moderated Heathcote's tendency to ultra-conservatism. As squire, Heathcote rather reluctantly entered politics; the only election he had to contest was that of 1865. In 1826, he was elected for Hampshire, the seat held by his uncle until 1820; he retired from the seat in 1832. In 1837 he was elected for North Hampshire, holding the seat until he resigned from it, through ill health, in 1849. He was &#145;in favour of all the aristocratic parts of our Constitution&#146;, with &#145;a horror of democracy &hellip; unbounded&#146; and he was &#145;no partisan of Peel's, for centralization is a favourite hobby of his, and a paid French police&#146;; he preferred &#145;the old Saxon plans&#146;. R. H. Dana found him &#145;not a compromise man, but a decided Tory and Tractarian&#146;  (Awdry, 69&#150;70, 115). He would not have dissenters as tenants, despite this principle's leading to substantial losses during the agricultural depression. In 1854, after a short period as a director of the South Western Railway, he succeeded Sir Robert Inglis as one of the MPs for Oxford University; as such he quietly represented conservative opinion in the university, in marked contrast to the constant controversy surrounding his fellow member, W. E. Gladstone (whose earlier election he had supported as chairman of his London committee). As MP he supported Gladstone's <span class="roman">Oxford University Bill</span> of 1854, though he had strongly disliked the royal commission to whose report the bill was a response; by his amendment, congregation included all resident members of the university. In the 1860s he strongly defended religious tests. Following an illness expected in 1868 to be fatal, Heathcote resigned his seat that year and devoted himself to the life of a country squire, managing his declining woods and estate, compiling a valuable library, and being active as chairman of quarter sessions, in diocesan affairs, and as guardian and subsequently friend of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13035/', "H. H. M. Herbert, fourth earl of Carnarvon")</script>. He died at Hursley Park on 17 August 1881 and was buried in its mausoleum.<br>
<br>Heathcote was unusual as a Tractarian in remaining a staunch Conservative; he had little to offer national politics save his courteously expressed dislike of the tendencies of his age; but his role as &#145;Keble's Pupil, Squire and only Patron&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman</span>, 29.410) and his friendship with his neighbour, Charlotte M. Yonge, and other members of the Keble circle such as J. T. Coleridge, gained him an otherwise unwarranted significance.<br>
