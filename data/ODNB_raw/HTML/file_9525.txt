<span class="headword">Fitton,  William Henry</span>  (1780&#150;1861), <span class="occ">physician and geologist</span>, was born on 24 January 1780 in Dublin, the son of Nicholas Fitton, a lawyer. Fitton was educated at the school of Samuel Whyte (1733&#150;1811)&#151;the English Grammar School&#151;at 75 Grafton Street. In 1794 he entered Trinity College, Dublin. He was senior classical scholar from 1798 to 1803 and graduated BA in 1799. Fitton's first intentions were to enter the church, although he was already interested in mineralogy&#151;an interest which led to his travelling to both Cornwall and Wales before 1807. His first publications were on Irish rocks with the Revd Walter Stephens (<i>c</i>.1773&#150;1808). From 1808 Fitton revised Stephens's notes on <span class="italic">The Mineralogy of &hellip; Dublin</span>, publishing them in 1812. The accompanying 1:240,768 map only showed petrography, while the text revealed the difficulties Fitton faced in relating Irish rocks to Wernerian formations.<br>
<br>In 1808 Fitton entered Edinburgh University to study medicine; he graduated MD in September 1810, with a thesis on pneumonia. At Edinburgh he attended lectures by both the Wernerian Robert Jameson and the Huttonian Thomas Charles Hope. From Scotland Fitton moved to London and was introduced to his first meeting of the Geological Society there, late in 1810. The following year he was admitted as licentiate of the London College of Physicians, and set out to establish himself in medical practice. Although East Anglia was an early choice, in 1812, with the help of Sir Joseph Banks and others, Fitton moved to Northampton with his widowed mother and three sisters, one of whom was <a href="#cosubject_59317">Sarah Mary Fitton [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He incorporated the same MD degree from Cambridge University in 1816. In 1815 he was elected FRS and, in 1816, member of the Geological Society and FRCS.<br>
<br>In Northampton, Fitton helped restore St Peter's Church, and supplied fellow geologists with mineralogical information. However, he reported in 1812 that he was &#145;sorry to say Northamptonshire has no food for mineralogists&#151;the country is composed of low rounded irregularities and intersected by slow streamlets but there is nothing like a hill and nothing favourable to the exposition of rocks&#146;. He had only seen &#145;a stupid kind of sandstone and a shelly limestone&#146;  (Fitton to Greenough, 12 Nov 1812, Greenough MSS, University College, London). On 8 June 1820 Fitton married Maria James, who brought him sufficient wealth to retire from medicine, return to London, and devote his time fully to geology. The couple later had eight children.<br>
<br>Between 1822 and 1824, the period immediately following publication of William Conybeare's and William Phillips's influential <span class="italic">The Geology of England and Wales</span>, Fitton proved an energetic secretary of the Geological Society. He carefully investigated the stratigraphy of rocks below the Chalk in the south of England, the stratigraphic relations of which were still in a confused and debated state, despite revelations from Gideon Mantell in Sussex that they were full of fossils and of remarkable interest. Fitton started publishing the results of his researches in 1824. These culminated in his memoir of 1836 <span class="italic">On some of the Strata between the Chalk and Oxford Oolite</span>. This clearly defined the confused positions of, and differing marine to freshwater natures of, these strata. Fitton separated an Upper and Lower Greensand from its middling Gault. The work was rightly hailed as a model of stratigraphic geology.<br>
<br>Fitton was also active as a geological polemicist and historian. Having studied both Wernerian and Huttonian geology in Edinburgh, he was able to publish a balanced assessment, entitled <span class="italic">The Geological System of Werner</span>, in 1813. He next investigated William Smith's researches. The true interest of Northamptonshire rocks, of which Fitton had been so dismissive in 1812, had been revealed by Smith's <span class="italic">Geological Map</span> of 1815. Fitton demonstrated the true value and originality of Smith's contributions to English stratigraphy in a review published in 1818. Fitton's views opposed those of the founder, and then president, of the Geological Society, G. B. Greenough. They soon clashed again over mutual plans to publish elementary texts on geology, of which only Greenough's appeared, in 1819.<br>
<br>The 1820s were a highly political period in Geological Society history. Fitton's attempt to get Smith elected honorary fellow of the Geological Society in 1822 failed and his 1821 printed reappraisal of Smith's importance could only be issued as <span class="italic">Notes on the History of English Geology</span>. As president of the society from 1827 to 1829, Fitton had at last been able to release Greenough's grip on it. His innovations included encouraging full discussions of papers delivered at meetings and starting the publication of its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> from 1827. In these Fitton inaugurated annual reviews of progress as &#145;presidential addresses&#146;. Fitton was also an active participant in the failed attempt to have a scientist (John Herschel) elected president of the Royal Society in 1830.<br>
<br>Fitton continued to review, in clear and analytical prose, important English books such as Buckland's <span class="italic">Reliquiae diluvianae</span> (1823), Lyell's <span class="italic">Elements of Geology</span> (1839), and Murchison's <span class="italic">Silurian System</span> (1841). These are some of the first properly historical assessments of the development of British geology. Fitton had copies of his 1817&#150;49 <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> articles reissued with a special title-page in 1849, to leave no doubt of their authorship. His only other separately published work was a 1833 <span class="italic">Geological Sketch of the Vicinity of Hastings</span>. He was awarded the highest honour of the Geological Society, the Wollaston medal, in 1852 for services to geology. He died on 13 May 1861 at his home, 4 Sussex Gardens, Hyde Park, London.<br>

<a name="cosubject_59317"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Mary Fitton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1796&#150;1874), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was probably born in Dublin. With another sister, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1817&#150;1834), she wrote the popular <span class="italic">Conversations on Botany</span> for the series of elementary science works published by Longmans and otherwise dominated by Jane Marcet's titles. This went through nine editions between 1817 and 1840. It features eighteen dialogues between a mother and her boy pupil conveying the principles of the Linnaean system of classification and information about useful plants. The hand-coloured illustrations are by George Sowerby and, although it was issued anonymously, later editions indicate that Sarah Fitton wrote most of the text, assisted by Elizabeth. It is sometimes wrongly attributed to Maria Elizabeth Jacson or Mrs Marcet.<br>
<br>In later years Sarah Fitton wrote short stories as well as books for children, including <span class="italic">Conversations on Harmony</span> (1855), which was translated into French in 1857. She spent some time in Paris; her <span class="italic">Four Seasons: a Short Account of the Structure of Plants</span> (1865) consists of lectures &#145;written for the Working Men's Institute in Paris&#146;, and one of her stories about the penurious circumstances of an English teacher in France suggests firsthand experience. Her last book was published in 1866. In 1865 Eug&egrave;ne Coemans, the Belgian botanist, named a genus of perennial flowering shrubs <i>Fittonia</i> in honour of the two sisters. Sarah Fitton died on 30 March 1874 at 15 rue Ville l'Ev&ecirc;que in Paris.<br>
