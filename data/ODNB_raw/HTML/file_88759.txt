<span class="headword">Russell,  (Irwin) Peter</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">poet and editor</span>, was born on 16 September 1921 at 34 Henleaze Avenue, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, the only child of Irwin George Russell, a commercial traveller for a scale maker, and his wife, Margery Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fortune, an invalid. When Russell was very young, his father died of tuberculosis contracted in the trenches in the First World War, and because of his mother's ill health he was brought up mainly in the care of a governess who instilled in him a lifelong love of literature, especially of Greek and Roman mythology. At the age of six he was sent to a preparatory school in Malvern, and from there to Malvern College, intent already on becoming a poet, and there he revelled in reading Homer, Plato, Virgil, and Horace in the original languages. He pursued his studies at home in the holidays, mainly in English, American, French, Italian, and Spanish literature. In his readings of Dante and Petrarch he first fell in love with the culture of Italy, an interest that shaped the course of his life. This passion was intensified as he read the works of Shelley, Keats, and Byron. On leaving Malvern College he spent the summer of 1939 in Heidelberg, supposedly studying volumes on organic chemistry for his entrance to Cambridge University, where he was to study natural sciences at King's College, but in fact spending his time reading German Romantic poetry: Goethe, H&ouml;lderlin, Novalis, and Heine. This eclectic background determined the internationalist approach he always maintained in his poetry, criticism, and translations. It also fashioned his approach to submissions as a poetry editor.<br>
<br>On returning to England at the outbreak of the Second World War, Russell joined the Royal Artillery, serving as an intelligence officer in India, Burma, and Malaya, and rising to the rank of major. While there he developed a passionate interest in oriental languages and cultures. Once, on crash-landing in the Bihar desert and then trekking for miles, he and his party came across a village of mud huts where there was a small bookshop run by a Hindu priest. All the books were Hindu scriptures in Sanskrit or the Bihari language, except one, <span class="italic">A Selection of Poems of Ezra Pound</span>, his favourite poet. He regarded this as a propitious sign, and was later to set up his own bookshops in Sussex, Kent, and London.<br>
<br>After the war Russell studied English at Queen Mary College, London, but left without taking a degree, worried, he said, that he might become an academic. His first book of poems and sonnets, <span class="italic">Picnic to the Moon</span>, had already been published in 1944. From 1949 to 1956 he was editor of the poetry magazine <span class="italic">Nine</span>, in which he published new works by Ezra Pound (defending his work against those who regarded him only as a traitor and a fascist), T. S. Eliot, Borges, Boris Pasternak, and Tom Scott, and his own translations. At this time he also wrote a book on Pound's poetry, <span class="italic">An Examination of Ezra Pound</span> (1950), and was prominent in the campaign for Pound's release (eventually secured in 1958) from the hospital in Washington, DC, where he had been held as insane after being charged as a traitor for his pro-Mussolini broadcasts from Italy. Russell had been corresponding with Pound since 1948. He was also reviewing regularly for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> and for C. V. Wedgwood's <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span> at this time. On 27 March 1951 he married Marjorie Alice Jewett, a widow, and daughter of Frederick Henry Keeling Bloxham, and thereby acquired a stepson.<br>
<br>In 1954 Russell published <span class="italic">Three Elegies of Quintilius</span>, supposedly translations from a hedonistic but well-informed and opinionated fifth-century Latin poet. He particularly enjoyed one pompous review, which declared that the translations were not a patch on the originals. In 1956 <span class="italic">Nine</span> closed, and from 1959 to 1963 Russell lived in central London, spending most of his time studying Persian and Russian literature (he was the first to translate Osip Mandelstam's poetry into English) and reading widely on the latest developments in the sciences. In 1963 he and his wife, Marjorie, divorced, and he was also declared bankrupt, regarding this latter event as a godsend, since he could now give up his business life and turn to the writing of poetry again. He worked for the BBC for a while before leaving Britain for good, living in the United States, Berlin, Venice, Yugoslavia, Canada, and Iran, teaching mainly, finally settling about 1983 in La Turbina, a remote former watermill in the mountains between Florence and Arezzo, sustained only by his books, whisky, and cigarettes. He wrote some of his best poetry there, publishing the acclaimed <span class="italic">All for the Wolves</span> in 1984, <span class="italic">The Elegies of Quintilius</span> in 1996, and <span class="italic">The Apocalypse of Quintilius</span> and <span class="italic">Towards an Unknown Life</span> in 1997. A fire and a flood at La Turbina destroyed many of his books and letters, but he survived these disasters with his usual fortitude. Being fluent and prolific in Italian and English, he found himself towards the end of his life having as many Italian readers as English ones. He was particularly proud of having a number of his poems in the Venetian dialect published. He had married, as his second wife, Lana Long, with whom he had a son, Peter George, who acted as his secretary at the close of his life, and two daughters, Sara and Kate; his second marriage, however, also ended in divorce. He had a number of other relationships.<br>
<br>Russell's knowledge of literature was both global and detailed, as was his experience of life. This breadth of vision was embodied in his poetry, especially in his musical lyrics, which celebrated life and art in an intensive unity that Russell believed was the permanent basis of a good life. Poetry should body forth goodness, love, truth, justice, and beauty, he thought, seeing all great art as a homecoming. Although he liked to wander into satire often, his main strength lay in gauging the primacy of the lyrical emotion, pitching it against lust, respecting intelligence and tradition, and conceiving of the poem as a perfect vision in an age given almost wholly over to empiricism, as he saw it. He believed in the possibility of coherence, completeness, total synthesis, and integration in a time of relativism and quantum uncertainty. He was never dogmatic, however, endorsing Pound's statement that &#145;belief is a cramp, a paralysis, an atrophy of the mind in certain positions&#146; (quoted in <span class="italic">Poetic Asides I</span>, 63), and believing that, above all else, poetry is a celebration, the joy of discovery. He died in hospital at San Giovanni Valdarno, Italy, on 22 January 2003, and was survived by his three children.<br>
