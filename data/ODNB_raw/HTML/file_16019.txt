<span class="headword">Langhorne, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (<em>c.</em>1634&#150;1715), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in the City of London, the only son of the four children of William Langhorne, an East India merchant, of the parish of St Gabriel Fenchurch, and Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Dr Daniel Oxenbridge, a London physician. Langhorne entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 23 October 1649. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 7 July 1652, and to the Inner Temple on 6 August 1664, but does not appear to have practised at the bar. He inherited his father's holding of East India Company stock, made money, and was in 1668 created a baronet.<br>
<br>In 1669 Langhorne was appointed by the court of committees to investigate a charge of fiscal malpractice which had been brought against Sir Edward Winter, East India Company agent and governor of Madras, with the result that Langhorne himself was made governor in Winter's stead in the course of the year. His arrival at Fort St George, Madras, on 14 June 1670 coincided with a critical period in the history of the settlement. Colbert had in 1664 projected the French Compagnie Royale des Indes Orientales, and in 1672 the French admiral La Haye seized San Thom&eacute;, just south of Madras, on the Coromandel coast. Langhorne maintained a discreetly neutral position between the French, who were at that moment the nominal allies of England, the Dutch, with whom England was at war, and the king of Golconda, who was attempting to regain San Thom&eacute;. It has been claimed that as &#145;a former Cromwellian who disliked Charles II's pro-French policy&#146; Langhorne &#145;connived after September 1673 at a suspension of hostilities against the Dutch&#146;  (Furber, 111). However, a contemporary observer accused him of &#145;actively espousing the French cause to the detriment of Anglo-Indian relations&#146;  (Watson, 295). In fact, Langhorne adopted a broadly neutral pragmatic policy designed to safeguard the interests of the East India Company and of his own private trade. When in 1674 the Dutch finally took possession of San Thom&eacute;, he contented himself with expressing sympathy with the French, at the same time strengthening the defences of Fort St George. In the same year the English settlement was visited by Dr John Fryer, the English traveller, who spoke highly of Langhorne as:<blockquote>a gentleman of indefatigable industry and worth &hellip; His personal guard consists of 3 or 400 blacks; besides a band of 1500 men ready on summons; he never goes abroad without fifes, drums, trumpets, and a flag with two balls in a red field; accompanied with his Council and Factors on horseback, with their ladies in palenkeens. (Fryer, 38)</blockquote>In 1675 Langhorne successfully resisted an attempt at extortion by Podela Lingappa, the naik (deputy governor) of the Poonamallee district, but only at the unlooked-for expense of what might have proved a perilous misunderstanding with the king of Golconda. In 1676 he showed his tolerant spirit by firing a salute upon the consecration of a Roman Catholic church in Madras, and thereby drew upon himself a rebuke from the directors at home. The code of by-laws that he drew up as governor helps to depict the contemporary social life of the settlement. Among his regulations it was enacted that no person was to drink above half a pint of arrack or brandy or a quart of wine at a time; to such practices as blaspheming, duelling, being absent from prayers, or being outside the walls after eight o'clock, strict penalties were allotted.<br>
<br>An over-shrewd man of business, Langhorne fell a victim, like his predecessor, to charges of private trading, by which he was said to have realized the too obviously large sum of &pound;7000 per annum, in addition to the &pound;300 allowed him by the company. He left Madras for England in early 1678, having been succeeded by Streynsham Master, who, antagonistic to Langhorne's &#145;suave&#146; and &#145;easy-going&#146; style, dispatched a &#145;scathing indictment of Langhorne and all his works&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.64, 66).<br>
<br>In England, in 1680, Langhorne purchased from the executors of William Ducie, Viscount Downe, the estate and manor house of Charlton, in Kent, where he settled. In 1707 he also acquired Hampstead Manor. His first wife was Grace Chaworth, dowager Viscountess Chaworth of Armagh (1632&#150;1700), second daughter of John Manners, eighth earl of Rutland. However, she died within a year of their marriage, on 15 February 1700. He married, second, on 16 October 1714, Mary Aston (<i>d</i>. 1730), who, after his death, married George (or John) Jones of Twickenham. At Charlton, Langhorne became a JP, and commissioner of the court of requests for the hundred of Blackheath (1689), endowed a school and some almshouses, and died with the reputation of a rich and beneficent &#145;nabob&#146; on 26 February 1715. He was buried in the north aisle adjoining the chancel of Charlton parish church. By his will, proved on 8 March 1715, he left at least &pound;1600 to be applied, after the manner of Queen Anne's Bounty, in augmenting poor benefices. Leaving no issue by either marriage, Langhorne was succeeded in his estate by his sister's son Sir John Conyers, bt, of Horden, co. Durham, and Langhorne's baronetcy became extinct. He was the author of two works arguing the case of the old East India Company against the &#145;interloping&#146; new company. The first was a broadsheet, <span class="italic">Considerations Humbly Tendred, Concerning the East-India Company</span> (1688). The second was a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Some Considerations Relating to the East-India Trade</span> (1694).<br>
