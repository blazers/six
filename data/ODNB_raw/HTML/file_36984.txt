<span class="headword">Withers,  Hartley</span>  (1867&#150;1950), <span class="occ">financial journalist</span>, was born at Aigburth, Liverpool, on 15 July 1867, the fourth son of Henry Hartley Withers, gentleman, and his wife, Jane Livingston, daughter of Matthew Dobson Lowndes, also of Liverpool. One of his elder brothers, Harry Livingston Withers (1864&#150;1902), became the first professor of education at Manchester University. He was educated at Westminster School, where he was a queen's scholar and captain of the school, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a junior student, achieving a first class in classical moderations (1888) and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1890). He was briefly a temporary assistant master at Clifton College, and then became a clerk in a firm of City stockbrokers, contributing meanwhile occasional articles to the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>.<br>
<br>In 1894 Withers joined the City office of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He married on 8 August 1895 Letitia, daughter of Robert James Tennent MP, of Rush Park, Belfast, and widow of Henry Harrison, of Holywood House, Ardkeen. She was the mother of a schoolfriend. He served as City editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> from 1905 to 1910, although Wynnard Hooper at Printing House Square retained a general responsibility for financial matters. After a spell as City editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> from 1910 to 1911, he returned to the City with Seligman Brothers, the merchant bankers. During 1915&#150;16 he was at the Treasury as director of financial inquiries, a post which he abandoned with some relief in order to take the editor's chair at <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, where he remained until 1921. In that year he was married a second time, to Alice, daughter of J. R. Elliott, with whom he had one daughter. He was connected with the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> from 1921 to 1928, when he abandoned financial journalism.<br>
<br>Withers possessed a sharp mind and a sardonic sense of humour. He had no time for slipshod thinking, and always went to great lengths to ensure the accuracy of points of detail. Northcliffe, who wanted him to return to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, was advised that Withers &#145;is a very distant man and does not beat about bushes&#146;  (Chisholm to Northcliffe, 5 Dec 1910, Times Archive, News International Record Office).<br>
<br>As editor of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, Withers supplied a steadying influence after the departure of the flamboyant Francis Hirst. One insider recalled that Withers just plodded on from week to week writing one and sometimes two critical leaders  (Edwards, 577). These often focused on the need to eliminate &#145;waste&#146; in both the public and the private sphere and on the idea that the war should be paid for by taxation rather than excessive borrowing which, he believed, would cause inflation. Withers was an advocate of sound money. &#145;Inflation&#146;, he once remarked, &#145;is the tree up which I bark&#146;  (ibid., 580). Though Withers is not rated one of the great editors of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, the paper was in reasonable health when he made way for Walter Layton in 1921.<br>
<br>By this time Withers had gained a considerable reputation as an author specializing in financial subjects. His first book, <span class="italic">The Meaning of Money</span>, published in 1909, was widely acclaimed; some critics compared him to Bagehot, whose work he much admired. It has been described as &#145;a great book, epochal in finance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 March 1950). A year later, to the delight of Bagehot's widow, he wrote an introduction for a new edition of <span class="italic">Lombard Street</span>. He wrote forty-two books in all between 1909 and 1942. His style was lucid and direct, and he had the capacity to surprise seekers after economic wisdom with some enlightening literary reference. His particular strength was an ability to make complex financial questions comprehensible to the lay reader.<br>
<br>Withers had a great influence on the generation of financial journalists and writers who came after him. During his professional lifetime the characteristic arid, technical City article at the turn of the century was replaced by a broader view. He was, as one distinguished fellow professional later observed, &#145;the first of a new kind of British financial journalist&#146;. His thoughts were invariably expressed &#145;in plain forceful English &hellip; independent of business and City jargon&#146;  (Fry, 16). He died at his home, Copford Place, Marks Tey, near Colchester, Essex, on 21 March 1950.<br>
