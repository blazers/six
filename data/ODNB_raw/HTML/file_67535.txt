<span class="headword">Morison,  William Maxwell</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">advocate</span>, was the eldest son of James Morison, factor to William Maxwell of Nithsdale. He was admitted advocate on 20 July 1784, and was from 1787 to 1789 sheriff-substitute for Clackmannan. On 27 April 1786, in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, he married Sibella Stephen (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1840), daughter of James Stephen, merchant, and Sibella Milner. They had one daughter, also Sibella, who may have died young.<br>
<br>Morison is remembered for the monumental dictionary of decisions of the court of session which still goes by his name. The need for such a collection, setting out systematically the decisions of Scotland's highest civil court from the beginning, had long been recognized. However, with the exception of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Decisions</span> by Henry Home, Lord Kames, first published in 1741, and continued by Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, in 1797, little had been achieved. Even the more limited objective of collecting the contemporary decisions of the court of session had proved difficult, despite the steady support of the Faculty of Advocates throughout the eighteenth century. In 1800 Morison advertised his intention of publishing &#145;a complete and uniform edition&#146; of the decisions of the court of session since its institution, following the general method of Lord Kames, and using both published and manuscript sources. He sought subscribers, the venture being at his own risk. The first volume appeared in 1801, with thirty-seven others following in rapid succession, the titles running alphabetically from &#145;Abbey of Holyroodhouse&#146; to &#145;Wrongous imprisonment&#146;. In the standard edition of 1811 the original thirty-eight volumes are bound as nineteen, containing 17,074 pages, excluding the appendix, and covering cases from 1540 until 1808.<br>
<br>The history of the various aids and additions to the dictionary is complicated. Morison produced a &#145;synopsis&#146; or digest of the collected decisions from 1804 on. This eventually ran to two volumes, commonly numbered 20 and 21. He also produced an appendix (appendix I) of additional cases as he went along. These are usually bound with the original. More confusingly, Morison edited another two-volume &#145;synopsis&#146;, containing cases from 1808 to 1812 and 1812 to 1816 respectively, these volumes sometimes being bound as numbers 23 and 24. He also edited the <span class="italic">Decisions of the Court of Session</span> from the year 1733 to the year 1754, originally collected by Patrick Grant, Lord Elchies. These appeared in two volumes in 1813 as &#145;branch I&#146; of &#145;appendix II&#146; of his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. In practice, these are rarely bound with the <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>. A further projected &#145;branch II&#146; of appendix II did not appear. In addition to all these, Morison edited the fifth edition (1812) of the classic <span class="italic">Institute of the Law of Scotland</span> by John Erskine of Carnock.<br>
<br>The value of the <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> was enhanced by the publication of W. Tait's <span class="italic">Index to the Decisions of the Court of Session</span> (1823), M. P. Brown's <span class="italic">Supplement to the Dictionary of Decisions</span> (5 vols., 1826) and Brown's <span class="italic">General Synopsis of the Decisions of the Court of Session</span> (4 vols., 1829). Tait's <span class="italic">Index</span> also contains an invaluable survey of the history of law reporting in Scotland, including a detailed and critical analysis of Morison's achievement. Despite his criticisms, however, Tait acknowledged that &#145;Mr Morison's courage and perseverance are entitled to the highest praise. By the publication of his <span class="roman">Dictionary</span> he certainly rendered an essential service to the profession, which might have in vain been looked for from another&#146;  (Tait, 515). Nearly two hundred years later, Morison's work has still not been replaced or supplanted.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Morison's Dictionary</span>, as it is universally known, is still cited on occasion in court. Thus, the leading case of <i>Steel's Tr. v. Bradley Homes</i> (1972), on error in contract, looked back to <i>Sword v. Sinclair</i> (1771), while <i>Morgan Guaranty v. Lothian Regional Council</i> (1995), on unjustified enrichment, looked back to <i>Stirling v. Earl of Lauderdale</i> (1733)&#151;and, indeed, beyond to the original session papers. Quite apart from its significance as a formal source of law, <span class="italic">Morison's Dictionary</span> is an important, although as yet underused source for Scottish social history. William Maxwell Morison died at Portobello, Edinburgh, on 30 June 1821. He was survived by his wife, who died on 26 December 1840.<br>
