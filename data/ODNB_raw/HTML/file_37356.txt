<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Despard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>French]</span>,  Charlotte</span>  (1844&#150;1939), <span class="occ">feminist and socialist reformer</span>, was born on the family estate at Ripple Vale in Kent on 15 June 1844, the third child and third daughter of the family of five daughters and one son of Captain John Tracey William French (<i>d</i>. 1854), retired naval officer, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eccles (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1865). Her brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33272/', "John French")</script>, later field marshal and first earl of Ypres. Charlotte French had a conventional Victorian young lady's upbringing, and frequently lamented her lack of a thorough education.<blockquote>There were moments in my hot youth, when I would rail against Heaven for having made me a woman. What might I not have been; what might I not have done had I the freedom and intellectual advantages so largely accorded to men? (Despard, &#145;Suffragette&#146;)</blockquote>Her father died in 1854 and within a few years her fragile mother was confined to a mental home. In 1863 the family moved to London, where Charlotte French attended a finishing school. For several years she toured the continent with her unmarried sisters. Then, on 20 December 1870, she married Maximilian Carden Despard (1839&#150;1890), an Anglo-Irish businessman who had made a fortune in the Far East. They had no children, probably because of Maximilian's poor health, on account of which they spent every winter cruising in the Mediterranean or visiting India and North America. With her husband's encouragement, Mrs Despard occupied herself by writing romantic novels (including <span class="italic">Chaste as Ice, Pure as Snow</span>, 1874) with high-minded heroines, exotic settings, and happy endings.<br>
<br>In 1890 Max Despard died, and after months of seclusion Charlotte Despard emerged as an unusually engaged philanthropic widow. Her chosen slum was the Nine Elms district of Battersea in south London, one of Victorian England's &#145;little Irelands&#146;. There she funded and staffed a health clinic, as well as organizing youth and working men's clubs, and a soup kitchen for the local unemployed. During the week she lived above one of her welfare &#145;shops&#146; and her identification with the local community was sealed by her conversion to Catholicism. At the end of 1894 she was elected as a guardian for the Vauxhall board of the Lambeth poor-law union. She proved herself a brilliant committee woman, bringing a rare combination of informed compassion, practical experience, and military efficiency to the board's deliberations. She was especially committed to the welfare of the most vulnerable &#145;paupers&#146;: children, mothers, and old people. She supported campaigns for free school meals and medical inspections for poor children, and in 1902 she toured Canada to see what had become of the Lambeth union's boy emigrants.<br>
<br>Mrs Despard's charitable efforts were paralleled by her political commitments. She was an active and vocal supporter of the Social Democratic Federation and the Independent Labour Party. By 1906, the year in which the suffragette organization, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), moved from Manchester to London, she was a familiar figure on progressive platforms. Mrs Despard wore a simple black chiffon mantilla instead of the large hat of a conventional Edwardian lady, and open sandals instead of tight boots. Although she never lost the bearing of a Victorian <i>grande dame</i> and was, by all accounts, a generous hostess, her own lifestyle was famously austere: &#145;In her settlement in Nine Elms she <i>lived</i> the life of a socialist&#146;  (&#145;Mrs Despard's birthday party&#146;, <span class="italic">The Vote</span>, 15 July 1932). The suffragette activists Annie Kenney and Tessa Billington-Greig who went to Battersea to woo her for &#145;the cause&#146; knew that the venerable and incorruptible Mrs Despard could not be dismissed as a hysterical self-seeker.<br>
<br>Charlotte Despard was more than happy to become the WSPU's honorary secretary:<blockquote>I had sought and found comradeship of some sort with men. I had marched with great processions of the unemployed. I had stood on the platforms of Labour men and Socialists. I had tried to stir up the people to a sense of shame about the misery of their homes, and the degradation of their women and children. I had listened with sympathy to fiery denunciations of Governments and the Capitalist systems to which they belong. Amongst all these experiences, I had not found what I met on the threshold of this young, vigorous Union of Hearts. (Despard, &#145;Suffragette&#146;)</blockquote>With those two other great widows, Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, Charlotte Despard was soon recognized as one of the leaders of the struggle for votes for women. In 1907 she was imprisoned twice in Holloway gaol, where her courage and good humour were an inspiration to other suffragette prisoners. However, later in that year the suffragette movement split, and Mrs Despard left the WSPU, eventually to become president of the Women's Freedom League (WFL).<br>
<br>Women's Freedom Leaguers were self-styled &#145;constitutional militants&#146;. Unlike the WSPU, which was run like an army, the WFL was democratically organized. It concentrated on &#145;moral&#146; tactics, rather than campaigns against property or individual politicians. The sensational grille protest, in which women chained themselves to the metal grating (now in the Museum of London) that fenced off the Ladies' Gallery in the House of Commons, was a WFL initiative. Mrs Despard, whose household furniture was repeatedly seized in lieu of taxes refused on grounds of &#145;no taxation without representation&#146;, was closely identified with such passive resistance strategies.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the First World War, Charlotte Despard's immediate concern was distress on the &#145;home front&#146;. Since her beloved only brother, Sir John French, was commander-in-chief of the British expeditionary force, she might have been expected to take a jingoistic line on that conflict. Instead, to her brother's mortification, she joined Sylvia Pankhurst in the socialist pacifist movement. After the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, her commitment to international socialism intensified. In the spring of 1918, soon after the vote was granted to women over thirty, she resigned from the WFL presidency in order to concentrate on a variety of other issues, including Save the Children, the Indian independence movement, theosophy, the Labour Party and the early British Communist Party, the London Vegetarian Society, and the Irish Self Determination League.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1918 Charlotte Despard stood, unsuccessfully, as a pacifist Labour parliamentary candidate for Battersea. However, she was delighted by Sinn F&eacute;in's victory in the same election. Among the suffragette leaders she had stood out as a supporter of Irish home rule, and when that movement gave way to the struggle for complete independence she became an active supporter of the British solidarity organization the Irish Self Determination League. Her sympathy for the Irish republican movement brought her into direct conflict with her brother, who in 1918 had been sworn in as lord lieutenant of Ireland. While he set about crushing the &#145;rebels&#146;, his sister was supporting them.<br>
<br>Soon after the Anglo-Irish treaty was signed in 1921, Charlotte Despard wound up her London life and moved to Ireland. Her ancestors on her father's side had been Irish, and she was fond of her Despard in-laws as well as her Irish friends in Battersea. Now she hoped to play a part in the setting up of a brave new state, but, as Ireland collapsed into a bitter civil war, she found herself back at work as a campaigner for civil rights and the relief of distress. In Dublin she became the president of the Women's Prisoners' Defence League. The house she shared with Maud Gonne was at the centre of radical Irish campaigns in the 1920s. Like other republican women, who found the English &#145;Mrs&#146; odious, but baulked at the Irish equivalent, <i>Bean U&iacute;</i>, which translates as &#145;woman of&#146;, she took Madame as her Dublin title and was nicknamed Madame Desperate. In spite of that nickname, and her great age, she was active enough to be classified as a dangerous subversive under the terms of the Irish Free State's 1927 <span class="roman">Public Safety Act</span>. When Maud Gonne was imprisoned she kept a constant vigil, for twenty days and nights, outside Kilmainham gaol.<br>
<br>Charlotte Despard continued to visit London for her summer birthday parties, around which the WFL organized its annual gatherings. At the celebrations to mark the <span class="roman">Equal Franchise Act</span> of 1928 she was f&ecirc;ted as an honoured veteran of the struggle for female suffrage. By then, however, communism was her main cause. In 1930, at the age of eighty-six, she toured Soviet Russia, taking a particular interest in schools, nurseries, and the general status of women.<br>
<br>In 1933, soon after her house in central Dublin had been attacked by an anti-communist mob, Charlotte Despard moved north. In Belfast she hoped to involve herself in a campaign that, briefly, had united unemployed protestant and Catholic workers. Then, as the international fascist menace grew, she supported anti-appeasement campaigns. She was too infirm to go to Spain for a show of solidarity with the republicans fighting against Franco, but in 1937 she did journey to London for the WFL's celebration of her ninety-third birthday. Two years later, on 10 November 1939, she died after a fall in her new house, NeadnaGaoithe, Whitehead, near Belfast. Madame Charlotte Despard was buried on 13 November, with republican honours, at Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin, near the grave of her good friend Constance Markievicz.<br>
