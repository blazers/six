<span class="headword">Spenser,  John</span>  (1558/9&#150;1614), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Suffolk, the son of John Spenser, gentleman. He attended Merchant Taylors' School in London from 3 August 1571, and then Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 29 October 1577. Soon afterwards, on 9 June 1578, despite lacking a master's degree (he was hurriedly admitted as a fellow the following day), Spenser was elected by the president and seniors to the post of Greek reader.<br>
<br>At this time Spenser was reported variously to have been acting as clerk or a <i>famulus collegii</i>. Both descriptions are consistent with his most likely role&#151;as a private secretary, probably to the college's president, William Cole, whose wife was Spenser's sister. The president claimed not to have pressed but merely to have acquiesced in his brother-in-law's nomination, but the unprecedented promotion aroused sharp resentment among older and better qualified fellows. Letters were dispatched to the visitor, Bishop Horne of Winchester, pointing to Spenser's lack of qualifications and his youth; his appointment was not only ill-judged but was also in breach of college statutes. But Horne confirmed the legality of the appointment. Spenser graduated MA on 16 March 1581.<br>
<br>In 1588 Spenser resigned the Greek lectureship, having served the minimum ten years required to retain his fellowship free from the duty of lecturing. He may have been the John Spenser who on 5 June 1589 was instituted to the vicarage of Alvely, Essex, which he held until 1592, when he was presented to Broxbourne, Hertfordshire; it was certainly he who on 12 June 1599 was instituted to the vicarage of St Sepulchre, Newgate. On 21 March 1590 Spenser graduated BTh, and he was awarded his doctorate on 20 April 1602. A chaplain-in-ordinary to King James, he was among the translators of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span>, serving on the Westminster group which worked on the epistles of <span class="roman">St Paul</span>. It has been remarked that in his sermons he did not adopt the colloquial style common among Elizabethan puritans but spoke with &#145;a more formal sober and gracious elegance, sometimes falling into excess of wit&#146;  (MacLure, 164). Spenser was married to George Cranmer's sister, a favourite pupil of Richard Hooker. He was the first editor of Hooker's <span class="italic">Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie</span>, published in 1604, and there is no doubt about his sympathy with Hooker's approach. Spenser's preface to the 1604 edition lamented &#145;this unhappy controversy about the received ceremonies and discipline of the church of England&#146; which had &#145;rent the body of the church into divers parts, and divided her people into divers sects&#146;, and had &#145;taught the sheep to despise their pastors, and alienated the pastors from the love of their flocks&#146;  (Hooker, preface).<br>
<br>On 9 June 1607 Spenser took the oaths as president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in succession to John Rainolds. His presidency seems to have been peaceful and uneventful. In 1610 he became one of the founding fellows of Chelsea College, Middlesex, and on 13 November 1612 he was collated to the prebend of Ealdstreet in St Paul's Cathedral. He died aged fifty-five on 3 April 1614, and was buried in the chapel of Corpus Christi College. A monument to his memory stands next to one of his predecessor, &#145;each being attired in his doctor's habits, and each holding a book, Reynolds a closed one, Spenser an open one&#146;  (Fowler, 175). His death seems greatly to have distressed his widow and children.<br>
