<span class="headword">Mabb <span class="st"> [Mab]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1515&#150;1582), <span class="occ">goldsmith</span>, was the eldest son of John Mabb of Clayton in Sussex and Joane Goble. He was apprenticed to Thomas Jones and became free of the Goldsmiths' Company in April 1539. From 1558 (and probably from 1540) he resided in Goldsmiths' Row in the parish of St Matthew, Friday Street, where he practised as a goldsmith. He followed a conventional company career, entering the livery in 1552, serving as renter in 1561&#150;2, as warden in 1563&#150;4, 1567&#150;8, and 1571&#150;2, and as prime warden in 1577&#150;8. In parallel with his ascent of the company hierarchy he served the <i>cursus honorum</i> in parish and ward: he was churchwarden of St Matthew's, Friday Street, in 1559&#150;60, and common councillor for the ward of Farringdon Within from 1560 to 1577. He was briefly a governor of Christ's Hospital in 1560&#150;62, but seems to have been more engaged with Bridewell Hospital, of which he was a governor from 1570 to 1577, becoming associated with the determined and controversial moralism of the regime of Robert Winch, the treasurer from 1576.<br>
<br>Mabb never scaled the heights of the city plutocracy, but his subsidy assessments in the 1570s (&pound;120) place him among the top 5 per cent of the citizenry. His financial acumen was widely appreciated&#151;he had served as the treasurer of Bridewell in 1572&#150;3 and as a city auditor in 1574&#151;and on the dismissal of George Heaton he was elected on 13 December 1577 to the highly demanding position of chamberlain of the city. His skill was sufficient to see off a challenge from Matthew Colclough, a candidate backed by Sir Christopher Hatton, in August 1579, and he retained the office until his death in 1582. Mabb's civic activism was characteristic of a man who adopted a forward protestant position. Leaving money for twelve sermons after his death, he requested his favoured preachers: Toby Matthew, then vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York, John Aylmer, bishop of London, Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, Adam Squire, archdeacon of Essex, and Richard Lewes. All were conformist, but all were noted for their commitment to preaching.<br>
<br>Mabb was the author of the <blockquote>Remembrances faithfullie printed out of his own hand writing; the true copie whereof was found carefullie wrapped up with his last will and testament, and other writings of great weight; and by himself thus entituled, A declaration of my Faithe; mine opinion of religion; a thanksgiving to God for all his benefits; an exhortation to my children, wherein all such are to learn a good lesson, as the Lord hath crowned with any kind of blessing and especially with bodily issue. (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 3.418)</blockquote>He was doubtless thinking of the blessings of his own marriage to Isabella, daughter of Richard Colley of Shropshire, for there were five sons and three daughters alive when he drew up his will in 1578, of whom three of the boys and two of the girls had reached majority. His will carefully divided the moveable goods among them and provided for his widow according to the custom of London. His properties in Hertfordshire, Sussex, Southwark, and London were to go to his widow during her life, and then were to be divided among the five sons. The pattern of his charitable giving was conventional, but spread widely: there were bequests to the poor in the London parishes, for poor maidens' marriages, among the goldsmiths, and in his birthplace, to the London prisons, to Christ's Hospital, for highway repair in Sussex, and for poor scholars studying theology at the universities. But in the spirit of the civic moralism with which he had been associated, he was careful to ensure that &#145;no notorious swearer, adulterer, or drunckerd shall have annye parte of this my legacie in annye wise&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/65, fol. 7). He died in 1582 and was buried on 28 December in the parish church of St Matthew, Friday Street.<br>
