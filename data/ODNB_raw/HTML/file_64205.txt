<span class="headword">Branston family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;<em>c.</em>1880), <span class="occ">engravers</span>, came into prominence with <a name="cosubject_3276"></a><span class="headword">(Allen) Robert Branston</span>  (1778&#150;1827)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Lynn, in Norfolk, the son of a copperplate-engraver and heraldic painter. He was taught to engrave on wood by his father. At the age of eighteen Robert moved to Bath, before settling in London in 1799. With his wife, Harriet, he had three sons, the first of whom, George Augustus, was baptized at St Mary, Lambeth, on 3 October 1800. In London he supported himself initially by embellishing musical scores and lottery bills with wood-engravings. Later he provided many wood-engravings for well-produced books, which helped significantly to revive this art form. He also aided the cause by training several apprentices, including John and Charles Thompson; A. J. Mason and G. Watts; his nephew, George Wilmot Bonner; and his sons, Frederick William and <a href="#cosubject_64206">Robert Edward Branston [<i>see below</i>]</a>. As a result of these endeavours, he has been called the leader of the London school of black-line engraving, a school which largely depended on others for its designs. He signed his work &#145;R. Branston sc&#146;, Branston, or RB. He died in Brompton, London, in 1827.<br>
<br>According to his contemporary Samuel Redgrave, Robert Branston &#145;engraved the figure well, and excelled with gradations of light in indoor scenes&#146;  (Redgrave, 52). Many vignettes of human subjects were commissioned from him to illustrate books, such as Robert Bloomfield's <span class="italic">Wild Flowers</span> (1806), George Marshall's <span class="italic">Epistles in Verse</span> (1812), and a reprint of James Puckle's <span class="italic">The Club</span> (1817), where he engraved figures after designs by John Thurston such as <span class="italic">Critic</span>, <span class="italic">Envioso</span>, and <span class="italic">Lawyer</span>. Thurston's <span class="italic">Cave of Despair</span> from Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span> was also engraved by Robert for William Savage's <span class="italic">Practical Hints on Decorative Printing</span> (1822). This is probably his most important plate, and it rivalled Charlton Nesbit's engraving of <span class="italic">Rinaldo and Armida</span> in the same volume. By contrast, Robert's representations of animals and nature were less successful, especially when compared with the work of Thomas Bewick. Chatto and Jackson, for instance, declared that &#145;in the representation of trees and natural scenery Branston almost uniformly failed&#146;  (Chatto and Jackson, 536).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64206"></a><span class="headword">Robert Edward Branston</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1803, <em>d.</em> 1877)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized on 26 June 1803 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London. Like his father, he was prolific. It is sometimes impossible to disentangle their work for on occasion they both signed themselves Branston. Like his brother, Frederick, Robert produced several plates for French publications, notably <span class="italic">Paul et Virginie</span> (1838), and, like his father, he produced a plate for William Savage's <span class="italic">Practical Hints on Decorative Printing</span> (1822): <span class="italic">Passage Boats</span> after A. W. Callcott, about which Savage remarked positively. On 26 May 1830 he married at St Giles, Camberwell, Surrey, Caroline Martha Lunn (<i>d</i>. 6 Sept 1880), with whom he had a daughter, Ann Mary, baptized in the same church on 26 March 1832.<br>
<br>During his life Robert Edward Branston went into business with several engravers. Between 1829 and 1835 he formed a partnership with John Wright at 4 New London Street. The majority of their work (signed B&amp;W or BW) was printed by Charles Whittingham the elder. They produced, for instance, engravings for publications by Edward Turner Bennett, including <span class="italic">The Tower Menagerie</span> (1829) and <span class="italic">The Gardens and Menageries of the Zoological Society Delineated</span> (2 vols., 1830&#150;31), and for John Britton's <span class="italic">Picturesque Antiquities of the English Cities</span> (1830). They apprenticed John Greenaway. Branston's second business partner was Charles Whiting, with whom he collaborated at Beaufort House, the Strand, until 1840. Whiting had acquired William Congreve's process for security printing in colours, so Whiting and Branston specialized in polychrome lottery tickets and banknotes. After the firm disbanded, Branston moved to 35 (later 76) Fleet Street, and immediately created an association with James Henry Vizetelly and a Mr Whitehead, while Ebenezer Landells acted as an engraving supervisor. By the time the firm folded in 1841 it had published <span class="italic">The Boy's Own Book</span> and had trained W. H. Wills (as well as, for a while, his cousin G. W. Bonner). Robert's last joint venture was with a pupil, William Dickes, who later became a prominent colour printer. Branston and Dickes worked from 36 St Andrew's Hills, and together they developed a method for printing in relief from a metal plate, a technique used to reproduce a drawing by A. W. Callcott in William Savage's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Art of Printing</span> (1841). Robert Edward Branston died at his home in Denmark Hill, Camberwell, on 6 January 1877.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64205"></a><span class="headword">Frederick William Branston</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1805)<span class="occ"></span> was baptized on 20 January 1805 at St Luke, Old Street, Finsbury, London. He spent his life in London, residing for some time at 4 Crescent Place, New Bridge Street (1848), and 48 Paternoster Row (1849). Many of his engravings of the 1830s were produced for French publications: for magazines, including the <span class="italic">Magasin Pittoresque</span>, and books, including L&eacute;on de Laborde's <span class="italic">Essais de gravure</span> in 1833 and <span class="italic">Les &eacute;vangiles</span> in 1838, which had designs after Th&eacute;ophile Fragonard. He also produced wood-engravings by well-known native artists for best-selling English publications, for instance, after William Harvey's designs for James Northcote's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1828); and after J. Franklin, E. M. Ward, H. J. Townsend, and J. Paton for Samuel Carter Hall's publications, such as his <span class="italic">Book of British Ballads</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">Nursery Tales</span> (1845). He signed his work: F. W. Branston, Fred Branston, or &#145;F. Branston sc&#146;.<br>
<br>More obscure members of the family include the wood-engravers Charles Branston (<i>fl</i>. 1856&#150;1878) and Elizabeth Branston (<i>fl</i>. 1832&#150;1834). Some addresses from London trade directories are known for them. Charles is listed as working at 21 Tavistock Terrace, Upper Holloway (1856); 4 Beaufort Buildings, the Strand (1863); 6 Fetter Lane, Fleet Street (1866); 4 Salisbury Court (1876&#150;7); and at 13 Edith Road, Peckham (1876), from where he established the firm of Branston &amp; Co. (<i>fl</i>. 1878&#150;1891). Elizabeth, meanwhile, worked for a time at 13 Golden Terrace, White Conduit Fields (1832&#150;4). Proof impressions of engravings by members of the Branston family are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Bodleian Library, Oxford.<br>
