<span class="headword">Garcke,  Emile Oscar</span>  (1856&#150;1930), <span class="occ">company director and constructor of electric tramways</span>, was born in Saxony. He came early to Britain, and was naturalized on 17 March 1880, but details of his early background and education have not survived. Their outcome was to provide him with a grasp of the commercial potential of electrical power, and his single-minded application to business enabled him to become the prime mover in the establishment of the British Electric Traction Company (BET), of which he was to be chairman from 1911 to 1920.<br>
<br>Appointed secretary of the Brush Electrical Engineering Company in 1883, Garcke subsequently became managing director, and by the 1890s he had become known in the City for his business acumen, as well as for his command of the new technology. He represented the London chamber of commerce at a conference called by the Board of Trade which led to the passing of the <span class="roman">Light Railways Act</span> 1896. This statute enabled tramways to be constructed without the restrictive provisions of the <span class="roman">Tramways Act</span> 1870, and thus offered new opportunities for investment, which he was able to exploit.<br>
<br>Registered on 26 October 1896, BET became the chief promoter of tramway schemes throughout the country. The first to be developed were at Hartlepool, Kidderminster, Oldham, and Stoke-on-Trent; and forty were operating by 1899. Two years later BET was responsible for 124 miles of electric tramway.<br>
<br>Garcke was to become the object of criticism from the left wing of politics, BET being attacked as &#145;the octopus&#146; by the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, and regarded with animosity by proponents of municipal socialism, including George Bernard Shaw. But the policy of constructing tramways in order to utilize the unused day-time generating capacity of the company's power stations proved successful; and despite some early financial problems BET emerged from the First World War in a strong position.<br>
<br>Garcke had a sophisticated understanding of business management, and adroitly managed the relationship between BET and its eighty or so tramway operating companies. The latter all had separate accounts, as Garcke was insistent that each subsidiary should stand or fall on its own balance sheet. In essence, BET was a holding company, and Garcke summarized the firm's structure as one of &#145;independence and autonomy of the separate companies in regard to their own affairs, but solidarity in regard to the general questions of principle and policy&#146;  (Fulford, 33).<br>
<br>Although Garcke's confidence in the electric tramway played such a great part in the growth of BET he recognized the potential of the motor bus as early as 1900, and by 1906 a subsidiary company was running buses in London. However, Garcke conceived of buses as feeders to the tramway network, and the development of the bus companies owed more to his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41018/', "Sidney Emile Garcke")</script>. The latter, indeed, later remarked that &#145;I have spent a lot of time taking up the tramways my father laid&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>).<br>
<br>Garcke's genius was recognized by the financial world, and after a reconstruction in 1915, under his chairmanship, BET attracted men well suited to carry on his policies. In 1920 he was succeeded as chairman by J. S. Austin, continuing as deputy chairman and chief executive until he retired in 1929, handing the reins to R. J. Howley.<br>
<br>In 1882 Garcke married Alice, daughter of John Withers, a brush manufacturer; and the couple had at least one son. Garcke was the author, together with J. M. Fells, of <span class="italic">Factory Accounts, their Principles and Practice</span> (1887), which was one of the first systematic discussions of cost accounting for a British readership. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society, and also became a member of the Institute of Actuaries.<br>
<br>Garcke's commitment to electrical engineering led him to be instrumental in forming the electrical section of the London chamber of commerce, and he was a member of the executive committee of the Federation of British Industry. He was a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and also founded the Tramways and Light Railway Association. In 1896 he launched the annual <span class="italic">Manual of Electrical Undertakings</span>, often known as &#145;Garcke's Manual&#146;. He was a founder member of the Institute of Transport.<br>
<br>Garcke died of a heart attack on 14 November 1930 at his home, Ditton Meads, at Pinkneys Green, Cookham, near Maidenhead; his wife survived him. The company he founded remained a leading power in the bus industry under the chairmanship of Howley and H. C. Drayton, until J. S. Wills, who had married Garcke's granddaughter, sold the operating companies to the state-owned Transport Holding Company in 1968.<br>
