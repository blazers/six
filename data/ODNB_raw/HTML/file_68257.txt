<span class="headword">More,  Mary</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1713), <span class="occ">writer and artist</span>, is of unknown origin. Information about her adult life can be derived from the lives of her two children from her first marriage, Elizabeth and Richard Waller, and from the preface to her manuscript essay, &#145;The woman's right&#146;. On 17 April 1680 Elizabeth Waller married Alexander Pitfield in St Leonard, Shoreditch, giving her age as seventeen and listing &#145;Mary More, residing in the parish of Saint Andrew's Undershaft, Bishopsgate&#146;, as her mother.<br>
<br>In the 1680s and 1690s, the More, Waller, and Pitfield households were residing close together. Richard Waller was the secretary of the Royal Society of London in nearby Gresham College from 1687 to 1709 and Alexander Pitfield its treasurer from 1700 to 1728. References in Waller's and Pitfield's correspondence reveal that Mary More was linked through them to other members of the Royal Society, including the scientist Robert Hooke (whose diary records discussing dreams with Mrs More), Sir Hans Sloane, and William Derham.<br>
<br>More's initial claim to attention lay in her work as a portrait painter. Only one of her portraits is still known to exist, heavily retouched by restorers: a copy of a Holbein portrait of Thomas Cromwell, which she presented to the Bodleian Library in 1674 as being a portrait of Sir Thomas More. More's connection with Oxford was through Robert Whitehall, tutor of John Wilmot, earl of Rochester, who delivered the painting and also printed a heavy-handed commendatory verse to her. More (and another anonymous poet who wrote verses in reply) perceived the poem as insulting not only to More, but also to women in general. This exchange of verses may have laid the ground for their essays debating the equality of the sexes, &#145;The woman's right&#146; and &#145;The woman's right proved false&#146;, preserved in a manuscript miscellany along with Whitehall's occasional verse  (BL, Harley MS 3918).<br>
<br>The full title of More's essay provides an accurate overview of its contents and position: &#145;The woman's right or her power in a greater equality to her husband proved than is allowed or practised in England from misunderstanding some scriptures, and false rendring others from ye originall, plainly shewing an equality in man &amp; woman before ye fall, &amp; not much difference after. The equality of their souls is also proved in that women have done whatever is of value that men have done, what hath been done may be done&#146;. In the preface dedicated to her daughter, More observes that it may seem odd for her to embark on such a topic, &#145;having never had any Reason as to my self to complain of the least Ill Cariage of my Husbands to me&#146;. Foreshadowing the arguments of early feminists such as Mary Astell, More asserts that in her society in general she has observed &#145;the sad consequences &amp; events that have fallen on men and their Wives, through this mistake of mens pretending a Power over their Wives, that neither God nor nature doe allow&#146;. More concludes that &#145;it is the want of learning, &amp; the same education in women that men have, which makes them loose their right&#146; and since men have always dominated parliament and made English law, women have been unjustly denied control of property and access to education.<br>
<br>The date of More's death is unknown, but it was after Richard Waller drew up his will leaving his property in Gloucestershire to his wife Anna only after his mother's death  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/546/104) but before his own death in 1715, when his wife, not Mary More, proved the will.<br>
