<span class="headword">Tate,  Christopher Thomas</span>  (1811&#150;1841), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, born on 16 August 1811 in Drury Lane, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, and baptized on 9 September at the nonconformist church of St Nicholas (later the cathedral) in the same city, was the third son of John Tate, hairdresser, of Drury Lane, and Elizabeth, daughter of William Penny, keelman, of North Shields, Northumberland. His name was Christopher Thomas Tate and not Christopher J. A. Tate, as sometimes stated  (<span class="italic">Dictionary of British Sculptors</span>, 380). He was first apprenticed to the sculptor R. G. Davies (<i>fl</i>. 1820&#150;1857) and afterwards worked for David Dunbar the younger (<i>d</i>. 1866). Leaving Dunbar to establish himself as an independent artist, Tate achieved some recognition with a <span class="italic">Dying Christ</span> (suitable for Catholic chapels) and a statue of Blind Willie. He then obtained a number of commissions for portrait busts, among them those of the duke of Northumberland, David Urquhart, Sheridan Knowles, Lord Byron, and Miss Elphinstone. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, in his obituary, remarked: &#145;His busts, for execution, precision, and arrangement, can scarcely be surpassed&#146;  (p. 102). He afterwards produced a <span class="italic">Judgment of Paris</span> and a <span class="italic">Musidora</span>, praised in the same obituary for the skill with which so young an artist had tackled &#145;such difficult subjects&#146;  (ibid.), evidencing in such work &#145;an original and vigorous mind&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Tate suffered from consumption, and in 1840, while engaged on a statue of the duke of Northumberland for the Master Mariners' Asylum at Tynemouth, he became seriously ill. Although he had evidently finished the most important parts, his former master, Davies, had to complete the work. In an attempt to regain his health, Tate went on a voyage to the Mediterranean. He stayed some weeks in Malta but, realizing that he was close to death, he sailed for home. He got as far as London and died there on 22 March 1841, aged twenty-nine; he was buried in London.<br>
<br>Tate had made very little money from his work and left a wife and two children unprovided for (although a relief fund was evidently started up soon after his death). There are a large number of tombs by him in the churches and churchyards of Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding area, for example his monument to the Revd Robert Wasney (1836) in St Thomas's, Barras Bridge. For his native city he carved the royal coat of arms (1838) for the pediment of the Theatre Royal, considered by both the obituarist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and a later writer, Rupert Gunnis, to be a particularly fine piece of work. According to his obituarist, &#145;his store of information was inexhaustible. Whatever the subject under discussion, Mr Tate was always able to take a prominent part&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 102).<br>
