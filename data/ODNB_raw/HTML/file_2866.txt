<span class="headword">Booker,  Luke</span>  (1762&#150;1835), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Nottingham on 20 October 1762, the son of a schoolmaster who had been married four times and had thirteen children; he gave the names of the evangelists to his four sons. Educated at home, Booker was ordained in 1785 by Bishop Cornwallis of Lichfield and Coventry. He was soon afterwards appointed lecturer for the collegiate church of Wolverhampton. He also held the curacy of Old Swinford, Worcestershire, before accepting the incumbency of St Edmund's chapel of ease, Dudley. In 1806 he was presented by his brother-in-law, Richard Blakemore, to the rectory of Tedstone Delamere, Herefordshire. In addition he was presented by William, third Viscount Dudley, to the vicarage of Dudley in 1812. Booker soon found himself in difficulties: the historic church of St Thomas, Dudley, was demolished in 1816 in the face of much opposition, and Booker was subsequently satirized in the poem <span class="italic">The Procession and the Bells, or, The Rival Poets</span> (1817), reputedly by W. T. of Wantage.<br>
<br>Booker was a popular preacher of charity sermons, of which he was said to have delivered 173, raising nearly &pound;9000. His poetry&#151;which included <span class="italic">Malvern, a Descriptive and Historical Poem</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Calista, or, A Picture of Modern Life</span> (1803), and <span class="italic">The Springs of Plynlimmon</span> (1834)&#151;was less successful. He also published <span class="italic">A Moral Review of the Conduct and Case of Mary Ashford</span> (1818), in which, extrapolating from the case of a twenty-year-old local girl murdered in 1817, he exposed the evils of promiscuous dancing assemblies. The pamphlet attracted much attention, as Booker assumed the guilt of Abraham Thornton who was, in fact, acquitted of the crime. Booker has been wrongly suggested as the author of <span class="italic">The Mysterious Murder</span> (1817?), a melodrama also based on the Ashford case, which was written by George Ludlam of the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. Additional works by Booker included numerous single sermons and <span class="italic">Select Psalms and Hymns for the Use of Churches</span> (1796). His most significant work, however, was his <span class="italic">Description and Historical Account of Dudley Castle</span> (1825), which was only superseded by Charles Twamley's history of the same edifice in 1867.<br>
<br>Booker was a JP for Worcester, Hereford, and Stafford, and a sternly orthodox opponent of atheists, Unitarians, and Roman Catholics alike. Like his father, he was married four times; he lost his eldest son, at the age of thirteen, in 1810. He died at Bower Ashton, near Bristol, on 1 October 1835.<br>
