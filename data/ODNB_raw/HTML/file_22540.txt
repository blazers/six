<span class="headword">Popham, Sir  Francis</span>  (1572/3&#150;1644), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22543/', "Sir John Popham (c.1531&#150;1607)")</script> of Wellington, Somerset, and his wife, Amy Adams. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1588 at the age of fifteen, but in the following year left the university to commence legal studies at the Middle Temple. He was granted much of his father's property in Somerset at his marriage in 1590 to Anne (<i>b</i>. 1575), the heir of John Dudley, who brought with her dower lands amounting to 700 acres in Stoke Newington and Tottenham, Middlesex. In 1597 he settled at Littlecote, Wiltshire, and soon afterwards inherited an estate from his father which was said by Aubrey to be worth &pound;10,000 annually. His participation in the Cadiz expedition in 1596, during which he was knighted by Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, was an early indication of his martial interests, which by 1598 had led to his appointment as deputy lieutenant of Somerset and Wiltshire and colonel of his own regiment of foot; he served as a JP for both counties. In 1606 he became a director of the Virginia Company but although he occasionally took part in company meetings his involvement with its ventures, and with promoting his father's colonial settlement in Maine, is uncertain. He also had an interest in the company for the mines royal.<br>
<br>Popham's subsequent life was characterized by his long parliamentary service. He represented Somerset in 1597, for which return, in respect of his youth, he had evidently gained assistance from his father, then the lord chief justice; in subsequent parliaments he sat as a member for Wiltshire and the boroughs of Marlborough, Chippenham, and Great Bedwyn, all of which were close to his seat at Littlecote. He chose not to put himself up for the Short Parliament, but was returned to the Long Parliament as a member for Minehead, a seat which he probably owed to the assistance of his son-in-law, Thomas Luttrell. He was made KB in 1603. In common with his father before him, he earned a deserved reputation as a litigant, and was criticized by observers for relying upon his wealth to exhaust his unfortunate adversaries in the courts. One suit which preoccupied him for almost a decade involved his attempts to secure for his eldest son, John, a third share of the estate of Sir Sebastian Harvey, whose only daughter John had married. The share was believed to be worth &pound;13,000, but although Popham eventually agreed to a settlement which included extensive properties and a dowry payment of &pound;10,000 his victory was pyrrhic, for the financial settlement was more than outweighed by his crippling legal costs. By the end of the 1630s Popham, though still rich in lands, was reputed to be living on a pittance, his income stretched both by constant legal expenses and by the extravagant indulgences of his extensive family.<br>
<br>Popham's opposition to the crown led to his being exempted from the royal pardon in 1642. Although during the civil war he is not known to have fought in any engagements, he took an active part in the military organization of parliament's army in Wiltshire and Somerset. His continuing ties to the west country reflected his extensive estates in the region, but by the mid-1630s he had moved to his house in Stoke Newington, having by then settled Littlecote on his son John. He died at Stoke Newington on 28 July 1644, and on 15 August his body was taken to the parish church in a long procession attended by his remaining family, his domestic chaplains and servants, and numerous dignitaries, lords, and MPs. His wife had probably died before him; of his three sons John, who represented Bath in the 1628 parliament, died in Covent Garden in 1638, reportedly as a result of his own excesses, but <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22539/', "Edward Popham")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66671/', "Alexander Popham")</script> were to distinguish themselves in the navy and parliament respectively.<br>
