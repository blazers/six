<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Pamela</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Anne Caroline St&eacute;phanie Sims; Lady Edward Fitzgerald]</span>  (1776?&#150;1831), <span class="occ">celebrity and associate of Irish nationalists</span>, was almost certainly the illegitimate daughter of Louis-Philippe Joseph, duc d'Orl&eacute;ans (1747&#150;1793), cousin of Louis XVI of France, and his mistress, (Caroline) St&eacute;phanie F&eacute;licit&eacute; Brulart, comtesse de Genlis 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Du Crest; 1746&#150;1830)
  , educationist. She was probably born at Spa in the Southern Netherlands, where Mme de Genlis was unexpectedly convalescing in 1776. It was claimed by Mme de Genlis that Pamela was the daughter of Mary Sims (<i>fl</i>. 1773&#150;1780), that her father was named either Seymour or William Brixey, and that she had been born in 1773 on Fogo Island, Newfoundland. Mary Sims was said by Mme de Genlis to have returned to Christchurch, Hampshire, almost destitute after the death of her husband, with the eighteen-month-old girl called Nancy Sims. In the spring of 1780 the child was taken by Nathaniel Forth, former secretary to the British embassy in Paris, into the family of Louis-Philippe to become the companion and fellow pupil of his children under the tuition of their governess, Mme de Genlis. De Genlis's intention that Pamela would help her other charges to learn English was part of her educational experiment, inspired by Rousseau's <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span>, to educate children apart from their parents. It was at this time that Mme de Genlis gave her the name Anne Caroline St&eacute;phanie, as well as the pet name Pamela in honour of Samuel Richardson's heroine. Pamela herself believed that she was the daughter of the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans and the comtesse de Genlis; it has been suggested by Stella Tillyard that soon after her birth she was sent to England in the care of a nurse called Mary Sims and was subsequently reunited with, if not officially recognized by, her natural parents  (Tillyard, 306).<br>
<br>From 1780 Pamela formed part of the Orl&eacute;ans household at Bellechasse and, under her adoptive mother, received an education that was largely guided by the principles of Rousseau. Pamela blossomed as a perfect female example of Mme de Genlis's educational ideals. The comte de Neuilly described her as:<blockquote>an entirely divine creature with a pale oval face, the most beautiful eyes in the world, although of different colours, charming unpowdered brown hair which she wore in curls, with a nonchalant graceful bearing and always dressed in simple but exquisite taste. (Tillyard, 141)</blockquote>During 1791&#150;2 she accompanied Mme de Genlis to England, where the pair were snubbed by conservatives but f&ecirc;ted by the increasingly small circle of radicals and Foxite whigs, including Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who noted Pamela's similarity to his wife, Elizabeth. This resemblance was also noted by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9546/', "Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1763&#150;1798)")</script>, a radical Irish aristocrat, who first saw Pamela in a Parisian theatre in 1792. Fitzgerald immediately had himself introduced and was invited to dinner at Bellechasse. A few days later, however, while Fitzgerald was still at Bellechasse, Pamela, Mme de Genlis, and her entire school were thrown into turmoil by the news that one of their number, Ad&egrave;le, another illegitimate daughter of the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans (who was now known as Philippe-&Eacute;galit&eacute;), had been placed on a list of undesirable counter-revolutionaries. Lord Edward followed the group to Tournai, proposed to Pamela, and was accepted; the couple married at Tournai on 27 December 1792. The following month Pamela arrived in Ireland and, with her husband, settled in Kildare town in 1794. Together they had three children, Edward Fox, Pamela, and Lucy Louisa.<br>
<br>Despite her acceptance by the Fitzgerald family, particularly by Lord Edward's aunt, Sarah Napier, Pamela was regarded by many within the Dublin social scene as a dangerous radical. In 1796 she accompanied her husband and Arthur O'Connor to Hamburg while the pair negotiated support for a French invasion of Ireland. She informed Mme de Genlis on this occasion that she did not share Lord Edward's revolutionary enthusiasm but her house in Kildare became a centre of radical organization and was frequented by Lord Edward's closest confidants. By 1798 he was in hiding in Dublin, preparing for an Irish rising, and Pamela saw him only intermittently. Following his capture on 19 May 1798 Pamela made strenuous efforts to see him in prison and may even have bribed access from one of the gaolers, who in turn double-crossed her  (Madden, 2.529). Lord Edward died in prison, two weeks after he was taken, on 4 June 1798. The government informer Thomas Reynolds claimed that Pamela was also involved in United Irish business, and the act of attainder against her husband resulted in the loss of the couple's property and her banishment from Ireland.<br>
<br>Initially Pamela travelled to Goodwood, England, where she stayed with her husband's uncle, the third duke of Richmond, who, it was rumoured, proposed to her. Leaving her children Edward Fox and Lucy Louisa in the care of her Irish relatives, she travelled to Hamburg, where she joined her childhood companion Henriette Mathieson (<i>n&eacute;e</i> de Sercey) on 13 August 1798. She continued to associate with and to assist exiled members of the United Irishmen who arrived in the city after the failure of their uprising. In 1800 Pamela married Joseph Pitcairn (<i>fl</i>. 1763&#150;1831), the United States consul in Hamburg, with whom she had a son, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Helen, born in 1803. However, the marriage was evidently unhappy and the couple may have separated before Pamela left Hamburg in June 1806. Despite the brevity of her marriage to Pitcairn and her subsequent resumption of the Fitzgerald name, the occasion provided the Fitzgerald family with an excuse to distance themselves from her, and a promised stipend of &pound;200 per year was withdrawn. In some senses Pamela provided a convenient scapegoat for the Fitzgeralds, who could pin partial responsibility on her for Lord Edward's revolutionary politics. According to Gerald Campbell, Pamela lived in Vienna for a year before returning to France but her precise whereabouts are often difficult to ascertain.<br>
<br>During the following years Pamela's financial situation worsened considerably. In 1812, while fleeing English creditors, she apparently met her stepbrother Casimir at Dover and accompanied him to Paris. However, she refused discreet offers of assistance from Mme de Genlis and abruptly left the city shortly afterwards. She subsequently lived in France at Abbaye-aux-Bois and at Toulouse. Her most permanent home was at Montauban in a house owned by her friend the duc de la Force. She paid a number of visits to Paris and was finally reconciled with Mme de Genlis, possibly in 1820. In 1830 she returned to Paris hoping to benefit from the Orl&eacute;anist revolution, which placed her former playmate Louis-Philippe on the throne, but was disappointed. She died at the H&ocirc;tel de Danube, 7 rue de Richepanse, Paris, on 8 November 1831. Though in receipt of a pension from the Orl&eacute;ans family, Pamela apparently died penniless. She was buried at Montmartre; in 1880 her remains were removed and buried at Thames Ditton, Surrey, by her grandchildren.<br>
