<span class="headword">Booth,  Sarah <span class="st"> [Sally]</span></span>  (1789<span class="mult">x</span>94&#150;1867), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Birmingham of unknown parentage. Her father died when she was an infant, leaving a large family of which she was the youngest of three daughters. She claimed descent from the seventeenth-century actor Barton Booth but denied any connection with her contemporary, Junius Brutus Booth, whom she later tried to persuade to add an &#145;e&#146; to his name to prevent misunderstanding. Her recorded career began in Manchester, where, about 1804, Sally and her sister Sophia appeared as dancers. She remained there under the management of the elder Macready, whose multiplicity of financial affairs soon proved embarrassing, but who promoted her to the performance of characters such as Prince Arthur in <span class="italic">King John</span> and the Little Girl in <span class="italic">Children of the Wood</span>. Her lack of education was said to have been rectified by the welcome she received as a visitor among several respectable families within the circuit of the Macready company. She subsequently went to Doncaster as a member of Tate Wilkinson's company and successfully took over the part of Alexina in Reynolds's <span class="italic">The Exile</span> when Mrs Stephen Kemble (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Elizabeth Satchell) dislocated a shoulder. R. W. Elliston, who was then managing the Surrey Theatre (formerly the Royal Circus), invited her to appear there in 1810 as Cherry in a burletta based on Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, in which he himself played Archer. In November of that year she performed for the first time at Covent Garden, as Amanthis in <span class="italic">The Child of Nature</span>, an adaptation from the French by Elizabeth Inchbald. She achieved some popularity: a poem &#145;To Miss S. Booth&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Theatrical Inquisitor</span>, written by one J. G. of Edinburgh, who had seen this performance. She remained at Covent Garden in various trivial pieces and was occasionally allowed to assume a major character such as Juliet. However, the rising fame of Eliza O'Neill wrested from her the hope of distinction in tragic roles, and she left Covent Garden until her rival had retired. Elliston remarked that she performed melodrama to perfection but added that she &#145;was for several seasons the heroine of that multitudinous succession of trash &hellip; the Covent Garden managers delighted to insult the taste of the town with&#146;  (Raymond). She then appeared at the Olympic, Drury Lane, the Haymarket, and the Adelphi, as well as touring widely in the provinces, where, it was said, she visited &#145;every tolerable place in England&#146; along with her sister, playing a few nights in each for a share of the house, and taking her benefit, which led to the accumulation of a substantial fortune. She retired from the stage about 1828 and last appeared in a benefit at the Marylebone Theatre in 1841.<br>
<br>Sally Booth was a strict observer of her religious duties and a constant attender at church wherever she was performing. On one occasion a clergyman took advantage of her presence to criticize the stage, which reduced her to tears at the time but subsequently led to an increase in her local audiences. She was petite and pretty and was rumoured to wear false hair. Her dancing was her special attraction, and was described as full of grace, agility, and sylph-like lightness. She had a wide circle of friends, including Camilla Dufour Crosland, who in her <span class="italic">Landmarks of a Literary Life</span> (1893) described visiting Sally Booth's dressing-room as a child, while she made up for the stage, and recalled her home in Bloomsbury Square. She lived in a cottage retreat in Highgate during her retirement, and died on 30 December 1867.<br>
