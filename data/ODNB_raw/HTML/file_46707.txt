<span class="headword">William</span> <span class="st"> [William of Blois]</span>, earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [Earl Warenne]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1135&#150;1159), <span class="occ">prince and magnate</span>, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26365/', "King Stephen")</script> and his queen, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18337/', "Matilda of Boulogne")</script>. Nothing definite is known of William's birth or childhood, but given Boulonnais naming practices and his mother's absence from Stephen's coronation in December 1135, it seems reasonable that William was born about this time and named for his great-grandfather, William I, the Conqueror. Although royal aspirations were left to William's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46704/', "Eustace")</script>, who was married to a sister of the king of France, knighted, and invested with their mother's county of Boulogne, William was still intended to play a crucial, if secondary, role in forwarding the Blois agenda. His marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28733/', "Isabel de Warenne")</script>, heir to the earldom of Surrey and the vast Warenne Norman lands, which may have taken place as early as 1147, was a smart strategic move meant to strengthen Blois control in their East Anglian and south-eastern strongholds. The addition of the honour of Pevensey to his wife's estate, and a further grant of the <i>totus comitatus</i> of Norfolk (with reservations), greatly increased William's standing, making him a certain instrument for containment of Hugh Bigod (<i>d</i>. 1176/7), an East Anglian rival of the Blois family who had long proved troublesome to them.<br>
<br>William's circumstances, however, changed overnight with Eustace's death in August 1153. King Stephen, giving way to public opinion, officially adopted Henry FitzEmpress as his son and direct heir to the English throne in November 1153, at Winchester. William's status as the foremost baron in the realm was assured by the compromise. He was to have all the Warenne lands in England and Normandy, the honour of Pevensey, the <i>totus comitatus</i> of Norfolk, enlarged by rents worth &pound;700 yearly, together with his paternal and maternal inheritances: the honours of Lancaster, Eye, and Boulogne in England, and the county of Mortain in Normandy. Basing wealth on enfeoffments alone William would be lord of more than 600 knights. And beyond this there was an independent title too, for he was to succeed his brother as count of Boulogne. No Anglo-Norman magnate, save perhaps Robert de Bell&ecirc;me, had amassed a like collection of lands and power. Even so, William at first was dissatisfied with the outcome at Winchester, and although he is said to have rendered homage to Henry, his name is noticeably absent from the Winchester treaty's witness list. In the early months of 1154 a Flemish plot, probably masterminded by William of Ypres, to assassinate Duke Henry came to light. The king's son himself was implicated. Henry left hastily for Rochester, eventually reaching the safety of Normandy in April. William, who had recently broken his leg, meanwhile convalesced with the monks of Canterbury. But if William, or for that matter Stephen, harboured any thoughts of manoeuvring out of the Winchester compromise in the coming months, they ended abruptly with the king's death on 25 October. At no time did any coalition arise to promote the earl's rights to succession. Once crowned, Henry II made certain of William's isolation.<br>
<br>In 1157 Henry II took advantage of a clash in East Anglia between William and Hugh Bigod, and confiscated all the former's lands and castles in England and Normandy, handing back only his paternal and maternal inheritances without their fortresses. William evidently appealed to Pope Adrian IV, claiming mistreatment, but to no avail. Henry II did at least allow the earl substantial exemptions from past gelds and county <i>dona</i> afterwards&#151;generosity freely shown only when, despite his great resources, William no longer posed a threat. The king even consented now to knight the earl, and the ceremony was performed at Carlisle on 24 June 1158. The next year William joined the great Toulouse expedition, the largest gathering of nobility from the Angevin dominions and its allies since Henry II's coronation. William's presence with the expeditionary force was probably prompted by sheer adventure, though no doubt he hoped to win favour with the king and increase his stature as one of the foremost lords among the Angevin nobility. This was not to be. In October 1159, while returning home, William succumbed to the same illness that had swept the Angevin forces before the gates of Toulouse, and was buried at the Poitevin abbey of Montmorel. William's dying childless sent ripples through Angevin patronage and politics for years into the future. His widow, Isabel de Warenne, was married to Hamelin of Anjou, Henry II's natural brother, who took the title Earl Warenne. His sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54455/', "Mary, countess of Boulogne")</script>, was taken from the convent of Romsey against her wishes and married to Matthew of Flanders, who became count of Boulogne, outraging not only clergy but his own father and brother as well. The honours of Lancaster, Eye, and Boulogne, and the county of Mortain, Henry II kept for his own uses.<br>
<br>Whatever promise William's life had held went unfulfilled. Even in death he was isolated from land and family. Stephen, Eustace, and Matilda all rested in Faversham Abbey in Kent, a Blois foundation, while William lay in Poitou. Recent excavations show that Faversham had been planned on a grand scale, but was completed as a much smaller church only in the thirteenth century. Faversham's fate provides a fitting metaphor for William's life.<br>
