<span class="headword">Blackwell,  Alexander</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1709, <em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">agricultural improver and government agent in Sweden</span>, was baptized in Aberdeen on 10 October 1709. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2543/', "Thomas Blackwell (1660?&#150;1728)")</script>, professor of theology and principal at Marischal College in Aberdeen, and his wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1749), daughter of John Johnstoun. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2544/', "Thomas Blackwell (1701&#150;1757)")</script>, was also a professor and principal at Marischal College. Alexander appears to have been the &#145;black sheep&#146; of his family and little detail is known of his early years, but he is said to have studied at both Aberdeen and Edinburgh universities before moving on to Leiden in the Netherlands. There he apparently studied under Herman Boerhaave in 1725. During his time on the continent he is thought to have travelled to France and Portugal. Although he subsequently became known as a doctor of medicine he does not appear to have sat any exams or obtained an official diploma. By 1730 Blackwell was living in London where he worked as a corrector for the printer Mr Wilkins. During this time he married Elizabeth Blachrie (<i>bap</i>. 1707, <i>d</i>. 1758) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2540/', "Blackwell, Elizabeth")</script>], the daughter of an Aberdeen merchant, who either wrote or undertook the illustrations for <span class="italic">A Curious Herbal</span> published in 1737. Blackwell's attempts to establish his own print house resulted in a two-year spell in a debtor's prison when he went bankrupt. Elizabeth allegedly bailed him out of prison by selling illustrations.<br>
<br>Blackwell then turned his attention to agricultural studies and was employed by the duke of Chandos as a superintendent of works at his house, Cannons, at Stanmore, Middlesex. In 1741 Blackwell published <span class="italic">A New Method of Improving Cold, Wet, and Clayey Grounds</span> on developing soil through its fertilization with lime, or marling, of which there is apparently no surviving copy. This work became known in Sweden, where the botanist Carl von Linne mentioned it. Around this time Blackwell met the Swedish minister in London, K. M. Wasenburg, and made such an impact that he was invited to Sweden. It seems that Blackwell was losing favour with the duke of Chandos and probably welcomed the opportunity to start afresh.<br>
<br>In May 1742 Blackwell arrived in Sweden; after visiting Nicolaus Sahlgren, a director of the Swedish East India Company, in G&ouml;teborg he moved on to Jonas Alstr&ouml;mer, a founder of the Academy of Sciences and a major industrialist who had spent seventeen years living and working in London, in Allings&aring;s. Blackwell travelled through south-western Sweden with J. Carlson, Alstr&ouml;mer's brother-in-law, studying local agricultural practices before returning to Allings&aring;s where he conducted his own experiments in both agriculture and animal husbandry.<br>
<br>Blackwell came to the attention of the Swedish king, Frederick I, and submitted a proposal for employment as an agricultural and animal husbandry improver in November and December 1743. His job was largely based on importing sheep from Great Britain. He seems to have found royal favour, for a letter of 28 May 1744 provided a refund for Blackwell's travel expenses and proposed an annual salary of 2000 daler from 1 June. In addition he was given tax exemption, the promise of a 1000 daler annual pension for his wife or children on his death, and was provided with the royal garden of Allestad in 1745 to conduct his studies. Blackwell also published an article in the same year which was sharply criticized by the learned circles who cried plagiarism. Blackwell had similar problems with his reputation as a doctor in Stockholm, as his Swedish peers questioned his lack of medical understanding. Despite this he was apparently appointed royal physician to Frederick I in January 1745, although no proof of this appointment has been found.<br>
<br>Blackwell suddenly became involved in the political intrigues of the Swedish court which divided into two factions of &#145;hats&#146; and &#145;caps&#146; following the election of Adolf Frederick as the heir to the throne over the Danish crown prince in 1743. Frederick I's party, the &#145;caps&#146;, looked toward the British court for support, whereas Adolf Frederick's followers tended toward France and Russia. At this point Blackwell appears to have made contact with the British minister in Denmark, Walter Titley, perhaps hoping to enter Danish royal service. He was certainly losing favour in Sweden, and in March 1747 was summoned to the court to provide evidence of his work. At his audience with Frederick I Blackwell suggested instead that Queen Louise of Denmark, who was a British princess, could obtain &pound;100,000 sterling from her father for Sweden's use, so long as Frederick allied himself with the king of Denmark. Frederick sent him to consult other members of his council, and Blackwell allegedly suggested ways of destroying the influence of the &#145;hats&#146; party. Further details of the plan involved transferring two Swedish regiments, largely consisting of the nobility of the &#145;hats&#146; party, into British and Danish service to remove them from the court and political influence.<br>
<br>However, Karl Gustav Tessin, councillor, president of both the chancellery and the college of war, and a supporter of the &#145;hats&#146; faction, became aware of this plan. Blackwell was subsequently arrested on suspicion of attempting to overthrow the king and government of Sweden. At the same time a letter arrived from the Swedish minister in Copenhagen claiming that the Danish king was arming for war. This later was proven false, but caused enough consternation to seal Blackwell's fate. Blackwell was three times subjected to torture in attempts to gain a confession. On 10 June 1747 he was sentenced to death, a sentence confirmed by the state council one month later. Blackwell was executed in Stockholm on 9 August 1747.<br>
<br>A letter, allegedly written by Blackwell and delivered on the day of his death, was published in London claiming that he had worked in Sweden as a doctor and that he was about to die falsely charged with treason. The account of Blackwell's life which accompanies this letter differs significantly from the facts generally accepted, casting doubt on its authenticity. Even a contemporary publication provided little correct information, and the real story of Blackwell remains unclear. Blackwell's trial and all the documents relating to it were kept secret until the mid-nineteenth century. There is, however, no proof to date that Blackwell was engaged in subterfuge with any foreign party, and it is most likely that he was simply used as a scapegoat to bolster Tessin's position at court.<br>
