<span class="headword">Dare,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">political activist and rebel</span>, was the son of a civil war cavalier and a goldsmith by occupation. He sat on Taunton's common council following the grant of a new charter to the town in 1677 (the corporation had fallen into abeyance in 1662 following the old members' refusal to comply with the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span> of 1661), and was a member of the whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>, which met at the King's Head tavern in Chancery Lane, London. During the exclusion crisis, he was active in promoting a petition in the name of the inhabitants and freeholders of Somerset calling for the sitting of parliament and the prosecution of Catholic recusants, which he presented to Charles II on the stairs of the House of Lords on 26 January 1680 just as the king was about to announce a further prorogation. When the outraged monarch asked &#145;How he dared do that?&#146;, Thomas retorted, &#145;Sir, my Name is Dare&#146;  (North, 543).<br>
<br>It was later alleged that while collecting signatures to the petition, Dare had said &#145;That the subject has but two ways of redress, by petition or rebellion&#146;, and he was indicted at the Taunton assizes at the end of March for dangerous and seditious words against the government. Dare claimed that when he had been challenged about the legality of petitioning, he had simply pointed out that Henry VIII had told the northern insurgents of 1536 &#145;that they ought not to have rebelled, but to have applied to him by petition, the subject having, as the king's words declared, but these two ways of address&#146;. When asked, however, whether he agreed that, &#145;suppose the King should not hear petitions, must we rebel&#146;, he had explicitly said, &#145;No, God forbid&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 152). The presiding judge, Sir Thomas Jones, refused Dare's request to have the trial postponed so that he could call a material witness in his defence, and advised Dare to plead guilty to the words but deny the seditious intent, promising to intercede with the king on his behalf. Dare agreed, only to be fined &pound;500, bound over to good behaviour for three years, and ejected from his seat on the Taunton common council. At the same time the grand jury made a presentment disowning Dare's petition and bound Dare over to the next assizes to answer another charge, this time for allegedly having said to someone who had advised him not to meddle in state affairs, because the king had his privy council to advise him, &#145;that he knew no Council the King had, but the Duchess of Portsmouth, the French ambassador, Lord Duras [Louis Duras, earl of Feversham], and the Duke of Lauderdale&#146;  (ibid., <span class="italic">1679&#150;80</span>, 428). On 22 December the House of Commons voted to impeach Jones for his harsh treatment of Dare, though the dissolution of parliament the following month meant that no action was taken. Dare remained in prison for at least ten months because he could not pay his fine, though at length he managed to escape, whereupon he fled to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Dare attended the earl of Shaftesbury on his deathbed in January 1683 and witnessed his will. By the spring of 1683 Dare was reportedly caballing against the king's interests, and over the next couple of years his house in Amsterdam became a regular meeting-place for English exiles in the Low Countries. John Locke stayed at Dare's house following his flight to the Netherlands, and continued to receive his mail there throughout this period. The duke of Monmouth and the earl of Argyll met at Dare's house in late February 1685 to plan their co-ordinated invasion of England and Scotland, and again in April to finalize details about the two-pronged attack. Dare served as paymaster for Monmouth's invasion force and sailed with Monmouth in June, coming ashore at Chideock, in Lyme Bay, several hours in advance of the main invasion force on Thursday 11 June to gather intelligence. Dare spent the next couple of days scouring the countryside around Lyme for horse, and by Saturday the 13th had managed to create the nucleus of a cavalry force. On that day he got into an argument with his co-conspirator Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun about who should have the best horse, and in the heat of the dispute Fletcher shot him through the head and killed him. His son Thomas was also involved in the Monmouth rebellion, but turned king's evidence. Dare's wife, Ellen, had accompanied him into exile; a few weeks after his death, she was apologizing profusely to John Locke that she was not yet in a position to pay him the money he had asked for.<br>
