<span class="headword">Reid,  (Anne Margaret) Nano</span>  (1900&#150;1981), <span class="occ">landscape and figure painter</span>, was born on 1 March 1900 at 17 Magdalene Street, Drogheda, co. Louth, Ireland, the second of four children of Thomas Reid (1862&#150;1933), publican and grocer, and his wife, Anne Downey (<i>d</i>. 1924). She was educated by the Dominican nuns at the Siena convent in Drogheda, and while still at school took art lessons from a Miss Sutton at the local technical school. She became a student nurse at the Mater Hospital in Dublin in November 1920 but left in January 1921 to undertake a more formal study of art. She enrolled as a student at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art in Kildare Street, travelling from Drogheda each day. A fellow student described her as a &#145;fierce red-head, [staring] with keen green eyes behind spectacles. She was uncompromising, blunt and desperately looking for the truth&#146;  (Snoddy, 420). About 1927 Reid went to Paris to study at the Acad&eacute;mie de la Grande Chaumi&egrave;re, and she returned to Drogheda about July 1928. In the autumn of 1929 she attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts and the Chelsea Polytechnic, remaining in London, which she loathed, for a year. She admired the work of the Argentinian artist Antonio Berni, whom she had met in Paris, and that of the Belgian painter Marie Howet, though later insisting that external influences on her work were personal, and that she had not been much influenced by her tutors.<br>
<br>Reid first exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin in 1925 and continued to exhibit there regularly until 1968. Her first solo exhibition was held at The Gallery, St Stephen's Green, Dublin, in 1934. Between 1941 and 1947 she held five solo shows. In 1942 a critic from the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> ended a review of an exhibition of her work: &#145;There seems to be no help for it. This young artist from Drogheda has to be saluted as a genius&#146;  (27 Nov 1942). She also exhibited at the first Living Art exhibition in 1943 when the <span class="italic">Dublin Magazine</span> described her as a &#145;bold and original painter but inclined to be rather too energetic in her approach and too afraid of colour&#146;  (Snoddy, 421).<br>
<br>Reid's early style was reminiscent of the work of Paul Henry. In the 1940s her work became more expressionistic and, as one critic noted, &#145;much more lyrical [with] the adoption of a bird's eye view of things [which] characterised her work from the 1940s&#146;  (Kennedy, 43). In many of her paintings her brushwork is uninhibited and vigorous. There is apparently little attention to composition or perspective. She was fascinated by water and it appears in her work in a variety of forms. Pubs are also a common theme, as are animals, especially cats. She painted landscapes of the Boyne valley which were imbued &#145;with a strong sense of mysticism&#146;  (ibid.). She was not a prolific painter and she supported herself by painting portraits and giving private lessons. In 1962 Reid returned from Dublin to Drogheda to live with her two sisters at the family pub. With the artist Norah McGuinness she represented Ireland at the 1950 Venice Biennale. She also exhibited at the Mostra Internazionale de Bianco e Nero at Lugano, Switzerland, in 1956; at the Guggenheim International Award Exhibition at New York in 1960; and at &#145;Twelve Irish painters&#146;, an exhibition organized by An Comhairle Ealaion (Arts Council of Ireland) and held at New York in 1963. In 1972 she won the Douglas Hyde gold medal at the Oireachtas. In 1974&#150;5 the arts councils in Belfast and Dublin organized a major retrospective exhibition of 108 works dating from 1931, held first at the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Dublin, and afterwards at the Ulster Museum, Belfast. Nano Reid died, unmarried, on 17 November 1981 at Drogheda Cottage Hospital. Examples of her work are in the Ulster Museum, Belfast; the City Library and Crawford Municipal Art Gallery, Cork; and the National Gallery of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
