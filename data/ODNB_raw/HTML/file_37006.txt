<span class="headword">Wood,  Thomas McKinnon</span>  (1855&#150;1927), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 26 January 1855 at 22 Leslie Street, Stepney, London, son of Hugh Wood, merchant and shipowner in, successively, Kirkwall, Leith, and the Minories, London, and his second wife, Jessie, daughter of the Revd Thomas McKinnon, of Sauchieburn, Kincardineshire. He was educated at the Brewers' Company School, Aldenham, Hertfordshire, Mill Hill School, and University College, London, where he matriculated in June 1872. In a distinguished undergraduate career he gained first place in the faculty of arts and the university exhibition in English. He studied political economy under L. H. Courtney and the philosophy of mind under G. C. Robertson. He graduated in 1875 with honours in logic and moral philosophy, and worked briefly on the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, covering subjects ranging from &#145;Casuistry&#146; to &#145;Cromwell, Thomas&#146;. He returned to London in 1878, when his father became blind, to join the family firm as a partner. The Wood family were active members of the King's Weigh House Congregational Chapel, where Wood met and married in 1883 Isabella, sister of the minister Alexander Sandison.<br>
<br>Wood's political career began with his election to the second London county council (LCC) in 1892, standing as a &#145;Progressive&#146; (the municipal label of London Liberalism) for Central Hackney. Wood won for Progressivism a seat which had returned two Conservatives to the first council in 1889 and would return a Conservative to Westminster until 1906. He soon joined the Progressive inner circle, securing election to the party committee in February 1894, and his prominence within the majority group secured a succession of influential council positions. He chaired, at various times, the parliamentary, local government, water, and general purposes committees, and the council itself in 1898&#150;9. He became leader of the Progressive Party in April 1897, retaining this position until he entered the government in April 1908. Election to parliament in 1906 had already prompted his retirement as an elected councillor at the end of the last progressive LCC in March 1907, but he was elected an alderman of the seventh council and remained on the LCC until March 1909.<br>
<br>Wood was an effective local politician, presiding over the Progressives' two most remarkable landslide victories in 1901 and 1904, when radical Liberalism captured some of London's safest Conservative suburbs. He was not, however, an innovator in policy. He joined the council after the main objectives of Progressive municipal policy&#151;the public ownership of water and other public utilities, the taxation of London's ground landlords, fair wages for council employees, and the extension of direct labour operations&#151;had been defined, and he added little to the programme himself. The views articulated in such occasional statements as his address on &#145;Ideals of citizenship&#146; at the 1904 Congregational Union Conference (&#145;private enterprise necessarily and properly has to look first to the question of profit; a municipal government can do a great many things aiming not at profit but at the general benefit of the community&#146;) reflected standard progressive views. He was a typical urban radical of his day, subscribing equally to the progressive social programme and the traditional Liberal causes of free trade and Irish home rule. An offer from Harold Harmsworth, the future press baron Lord Rothermere, in 1901 to support the Progressives in return for the &#145;elimination of Home Rule and the acceptance of a policy of sane and unaggressive imperialism&#146; held little appeal to Wood or most of his party. Indeed, Wood's greatest problems as party leader arose over the traditional Liberal concern of denominational education, when the <span class="roman">Education (London) Act</span> of 1903 established the LCC as the capital's education authority, implementing a measure detested by most nonconformists. Though a Congregationalist himself, Wood saw education as a social rather than a denominational issue, but his determination to operate the act disturbed some nonconformist progressives and ensured his vilification by militant dissent outside the council.<br>
<br>After three unsuccessful attempts, at East Islington (1895), St Rollox, Glasgow (1900), and Orkney and Shetland (1902), Wood entered parliament as Liberal member for St Rollox in 1906&#151;one of five LCC Progressives to be returned. St Rollox was a largely working-class seat containing railway and other engineering works, and Wood's background in social politics helped him not merely to win the constituency in the Liberal landslide of 1906, but to retain until 1918 a seat which had previously returned a new member at every election since its creation. In his 1906 campaign he emphasized unemployment and old age pensions and indicated his support for universal suffrage, the payment of MPs, and the Labour Party's <span class="roman">Trades Disputes Bill</span>. At Westminster, though, he proved to be &#145;very nearly a silent member of the House of Commons&#151;except when London measures were under discussion&#146;.<br>
<br>Wood's ministerial career was undistinguished. He was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education by Asquith in April 1908, apparently to alleviate nonconformist misgivings over that year's abortive <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>. His handling of the education issue at the LCC made him a questionable choice for this task, but he had little opportunity to make further enemies before he was appointed under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office, in October 1908, ostensibly to enhance that department's commercial expertise. In October 1911 he became financial secretary to the Treasury, convincing himself that he would &#145;have more power than three fourths of the Cabinet&#146;, though T. P. O'Connor remembered him as doing his work there &#145;without any great distinction&#146;. Despite an unimpressive ministerial record he was a convenient choice to succeed Lord Pentland as Scottish secretary, thus entering the cabinet, in February 1912. In this post he steered various measures through parliament, including the <span class="roman">Mental Deficiency (Scotland) Act</span> of 1913 and the <span class="roman">Temperance (Scotland) Act</span> of 1913; though not a teetotaller, he supported temperance and with the latter measure he became the only British politician to pass a local option bill into law. He also introduced measures necessary for Scottish wartime organization with skill and tact. In July 1916 he was again appointed financial secretary to the Treasury, remaining in the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, but his ministerial career ended with the collapse of the first wartime coalition in December 1916, when he fell victim to the reconstruction of the government. The 1918 &#145;coupon election&#146; brought predictable humiliation to Wood, as to other Asquithians, when, after a campaign devoted largely to attacks upon Lloyd George, he lost his deposit at St Rollox, gaining only 8 per cent of the vote. He made one attempt to return to parliament in 1922, when he was defeated in his former LCC constituency of Central Hackney.<br>
<br>Wood served as deputy lieutenant for the county of London in 1899; he declined a knighthood in 1907, but was sworn a privy councillor in 1911. He became a life governor of University College, London, and received an honorary LLD from St Andrews University in 1899.<br>
<br>Wood's London addresses during his LCC years were, successively, Brookfield House, Highgate, and Portland Place. He acquired a house at Crowborough in Sussex in the 1900s. He had six sons and two daughters, four sons and one daughter surviving him. He died at 24 Queen's Gate, South Kensington, London, on 26 March 1927, two weeks after his wife. &#145;His nature had no expansiveness&#146;, O'Connor recalled, &#145;It was essentially dry, uninspired and uninspiring&#146;. Another obituarist noted &#145;a certain brusqueness which unnecessarily alienated some of his political friends&#146;, suggesting that &#145;the cavalier way in which he sometimes treated opponents did not tend to smooth his political path&#146;.<br>
