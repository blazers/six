<span class="headword">Cochrane,  John George</span>  (1780&#150;1852), <span class="occ">publisher and librarian</span>, was born at Glasgow on 21 December 1780, the son of John Cochrane, who worked in the legal profession, and his wife, Katharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morison. By the time he was twenty Cochrane worked in London, where he married, on 30 March 1805, Sarah Bishop. He became a partner of John White. The publishing firm of White, Cochrane &amp; Co. carried on an extensive business in Fleet Street, involved with the publication, for instance, of James Sowerby's <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (1790&#150;1816) and Alymer B. Lambert's <span class="italic">Genus Pinus</span> (1803). Prosperity lasted until they became involved in the downturn in trade which followed the failure of Archibald Constable, and they were declared bankrupt in 1815. Cochrane wrote anonymously a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Case Stated between the Public Libraries and the Booksellers</span> (1813), calling attention to the hardship suffered by publishers, who were obliged, under the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span>, to supply copies of their books, however expensive, to eleven public libraries. He and his partner were examined before the parliamentary committee of 1813. He also during this period published and edited in a limited edition of 250 copies <span class="italic">The English Works of Roger Ascham, Preceptor to Queen Elizabeth, I</span> (1815).<br>
<br>Cochrane subsequently became manager of the foreign bookselling house of Messrs Treuttel, W&uuml;rtz, Treuttel jun. and Richter of Soho Square, London, which published in July 1827 the first number of the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>. The editorship was accepted by Cochrane, who remained the sole editor until 1834, also contributing various reviews and articles. Cochrane was, in the words of the <span class="italic">Wellesley index</span>, a &#145;strong editor [who] gathered together an impressive, if seemingly disparate group of contributors&#146;  (Curran, 131). Richter became bankrupt on 9 December 1834, and Cochrane established <span class="italic">Cochrane's Foreign Quarterly Review</span> (1835), only two numbers of which appeared. Cochrane was an unsuccessful candidate for the librarianship of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, and for some time acted as the editor of the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>. Friendship with Robert Cadell caused him to be chosen to assist George Huntly Gordon in cataloguing Sir Walter Scott's library at Abbotsford, and producing an index to the catalogue. It was necessary to print the catalogue, and extra copies were produced for members of the Maitland and Bannatyne clubs (1838). References to passages in Scott's writings connected with the books throw considerable light upon Scott's literary history.<br>
<br>Cochrane afterwards lived for some time at Hertford, where he was editor of a local newspaper. Owing to the strong support of his old friend Thomas Carlyle, on 17 February 1841 Cochrane became the first secretary and librarian of the London Library, founded in the previous year. This institution was opened on 3 May at 49 Pall Mall; in March 1842 the first catalogue was issued by Cochrane, who also issued two supplements to it in 1843 and 1844. In April 1845 the committee took a lease of the premises in St James's Square, and in 1847 an enlarged edition of the catalogue appeared, recording holdings after this move. A short time before Cochrane's death a supplementary volume was compiled, in which a general classified index was announced. Following the death, on 20 August 1847, of his first wife, he married, on 22 February 1848, a widow, Maria Vaughan (<i>b</i>. 1805/6), daughter of Stephen Haines. Cochrane died at his apartments in the library, St James's Square, London, on 4 May 1852, in his seventy-second year. Thomas Carlyle and John Stuart Mill, among others, wrote in their letters sympathetically of Cochrane. Carlyle called him &#145;White Owl&#146;, and observed: &#145;Poor old Cochrane, our first librarian of London Library, and essentially the builder and architect there. The only real bibliographer I have ever met within Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 22.75, n. 8).<br>
