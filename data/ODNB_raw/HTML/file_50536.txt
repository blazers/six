<span class="headword">Hardman family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1820&#150;1935), <span class="occ">manufacturers of ecclesiastical furnishings</span>, came to prominence via the family firm's association with the architect, designer, and pioneer of the Gothic revival, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22869/', "Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812&#150;1852)")</script>, for whom it executed designs for metalwork, stained glass, and decorative painting. The firm's founder was <a name="cosubject_50536"></a><span class="headword">John Hardman</span>  (1811&#150;1867)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized on 9 August 1811 at St Peter's Roman Catholic Church in Birmingham, the third of the four surviving children of <a name="cosubject_67863"></a><span class="headword">John Hardman</span>  (1767&#150;1844), <span class="occ">button maker and medallist</span>, and his second wife, Lydia Wareing (<i>d</i>. 1816). His father, who later became known as John Hardman senior in order to differentiate him from his son, was a stalwart of the Roman Catholic community in Birmingham. He made significant contributions to the building of St Chad's Cathedral and founded the Convent of Mercy in Handsworth, Birmingham (three of his daughters entered the religious life), as well as a number of Catholic charitable organizations. Educated at Stonyhurst College (1824&#150;7) John Hardman became a partner in his father's thriving button making business (Hardman and Lewis, later Hardman and Iliffe) at Paradise Street, Birmingham. The Hardmans probably met Pugin when he later was working at St Mary's, Oscott: according to Pugin's diary he was invited to dine with the Hardmans on 29 May 1837 (V&amp;A, L 5158&#150;1969). While there is no doubt that he admired the elder Hardman it was with the younger man that Pugin formed a close and lasting friendship. Pugin, who always experienced difficulty in finding manufacturers who met his exacting standards of craftsmanship, was evidently delighted to make the acquaintance of someone with expertise in metalwork who in addition shared his deep religious and moral convictions and interest in the Roman Catholic revival. This shared commitment to the revival of their religion and its practice evolved into a new manufacturing venture to provide furnishings mainly for churches but also for domestic use. Describing themselves as the first of the medieval metalworkers, Pugin and Hardman were supplying a modest range of articles from June 1838, including book clasps, silver mounted cruets, and ciboria designed by Pugin and manufactured by Hardman. In 1841 production was expanded to include monumental brasses. The two men were guided by Pugin's belief that the Gothic was the only appropriate Christian style. They benefited from the increasing demand for truly Gothic products from newly constructed Catholic churches as well as from new Anglican churches and those undergoing restoration. Turnover of the firm was &pound;1000 in 1841.<br>
<br>Hardman had married Anne (<i>c</i>.1809&#150;1880), daughter of George Gibson of Manchester, probably on 23 August 1832 in Manchester, and on 5 May 1843 their first son, John Bernard Hardman, was born at the family home, St John's, Hunter's Lane, Handsworth. They had two surviving sons and five daughters in all.<br>
<br>In 1845 Hardman's increasingly diverse enterprise moved from the premises of the button making firm into its own workshops at Great Charles Street (the button business continued to thrive and won a prize medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851.) At the new premises Hardman had a number of workshops, but he continued to employ outworkers and also used subcontractors, often local firms. The business expanded from producing church furnishings, such as candlesticks, chalices, pyxes, and thuribles in precious and base metal, to producing stained glass (from 1845) and undertaking decorative painting in addition. To the growing ecclesiastical orders from Great Britain, Europe, and Australia were added numerous and valuable requests for fitting out the Palace of Westminster, the largest secular commission that Hardmans undertook. It accounted for the rapid rise in business which saw turnover exceed &pound;12,000 in 1848.<br>
<br>Pugin provided the inspiration for the astonishing quantity and range of individual designs, but without the manufacturing acumen, organizational skills, and commitment of Hardman the project could not have succeeded. From the surviving ledgers, letters, and workbooks it is clear that Hardman's role involved liaison with clients and designer, interpreting Pugin's designs for the workmen, overseeing production, and managing the accounts.<br>
<br>Pugin claimed to be reviving traditional working methods, and Hardman was credited with having done so, but an examination of the surviving objects reveals a more pragmatic approach. Most of the Hardman production in Pugin's lifetime was in base metal and nearly all was machine made, using the most sophisticated modern methods available in a nineteenth-century metal foundry. Objects were cast or die-stamped, bowls of chalices spun, and full use was made of electroforming. More emphasis was placed on traditional silversmithing skills in the manufacture of items in precious metal, although raising and chasing were often used in conjunction with more industrial practices. It would appear from correspondence between Pugin and Hardman that both were satisfied with an impressive finish rather than the exclusive use of medieval methods of manufacture.<br>
<br>The enormous orders for the Palace of Westminster (for which it supplied all the metalwork and all the stained glass except for one set of windows in the Lords' chamber), continuing important commissions, and the preparations for the Great Exhibition of 1851 must have stretched the capacity of the business to its limit. The firm's work for Pugin's medieval court at the Great Exhibition won the highest accolade, a council medal, in the general hardware class and a prize medal for church articles. Every aspect of church furnishings was shown, with the Hardmans' exhibits covering an impressive area, 560 square feet of floor space and 1360 square feet of wall space. From the unlikely formula of the strongest of religious, moral, and artistic convictions Pugin and Hardman had found a market for the products that they wanted to supply and had succeeded in making a profitable business from it. John Hardman had sacrificed his health for the business, financial strain, hard work, and anxiety all contributing to his decline. He retired from an active role in the firm in 1857 and retired completely in the summer of 1863, when he moved with his wife to Pemberton Villa, 3 Clifton Park, Bristol. He died there on 29 May 1867, his body being brought back to Birmingham for burial on 18 June in the crypt of St Chad's Cathedral in a chantry that had been presented to his father as a gift in recognition of his benefactions. Hardman himself had been instrumental in founding a choir at St Chad's for the performance of Gregorian chant and had personally managed the choir until his departure from Birmingham. He had performed as a baritone in the choir, as had a number of his exclusively Catholic workforce. In appearance he was the archetypal middle-class Victorian gentleman, complete with goatee beard and spectacles. He was a leading figure in the establishment of a Catholic reformatory for boys at Mount St Bernard's in Charnwood Forest, Leicestershire, in 1855. For a short time he served on Birmingham town council and on one of the committees of the Great Exhibition. Above all though, as his obituary in <span class="italic">The Builder</span> (25, 1867, 408) claimed, he gave Birmingham a new industry. Hardman was succeeded as senior partner in Hardmans by his elder son, John Bernard Hardman (1843&#150;1903); his younger son, Mary George Edward Hardman (1844&#150;1904), was also involved in the firm.<br>
<br>Following Pugin's death in 1852 Hardman's nephew <a name="cosubject_60960"></a><span class="headword">John Hardman Powell</span>  (1827&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span> became his chief designer. Powell was born in Birmingham on 4 March 1827, the seventh of the twelve children of William Powell (1789&#150;1861), brass-founder, and his wife, Lucy (1793&#150;1863), embroiderer, daughter of John Hardman senior and his first wife, Juliana Weetman. Lucy Powell's textile business was closely allied to her half-brother's metalworks, and she undertook commissions for vestments and other textiles for Pugin. Her firm continued in existence throughout the nineteenth century under the successive titles Mistress Powell &amp; Daughters, Powell and Browns, and finally (after her death) the Misses Brown.<br>
<br>John Hardman Powell (also known as John Powell) showed early evidence of his artistic abilities and was placed under George Elkington (of Elkington &amp; Co., Birmingham) to learn modelling. He also spent some time as a pupil at the Birmingham School of Art. However, the association of his uncle John Hardman with Pugin, and the latter's need for an assistant, led to his being dispatched in December 1844 to Ramsgate to take up residence in Pugin's home, The Grange, and to be trained by him. Powell and Pugin's own son, Edward, were his only pupils. Initially Pugin complained to John Hardman about the injury done to Powell by Elkington's style (as well as Powell's propensity for somnambulism), but soon even the perfectionist Pugin found his work satisfactory. There is evidence that even before Pugin's death Powell was drawing a significant number of cartoons for Hardman windows, as well as designing many pieces of metalwork. With the exception of the first half of 1848 Powell remained in Ramsgate until Pugin's death. Thus it was in Ramsgate on 21 October 1850 that he married Anne (1832&#150;1897), Pugin's eldest daughter by his first wife, Anne Garnet.<br>
<br>Following Pugin's death Powell returned permanently to Birmingham, living in the same street as his uncle, Hunter's Lane, Handsworth, and assumed Pugin's mantle as chief designer for Hardmans. He was instrumental in the relocation of the firm's premises to New Hall Hill, where it remained until 1970. Powell was also taken into partnership by his uncle, joining his two elder brothers, William Powell (1820&#150;1895) and James Powell (1825&#150;1865). From the early 1850s the firm was known as John Hardman &amp; Co. Two younger brothers, Edward (1833&#150;1876) and Henry (1835&#150;1882), worked for the firm in Ireland.<br>
<br>John Hardman Powell was concerned with all aspects of design as artistic director of both glass and metal departments until the business was divided in 1883, whereupon his activities were confined to the glass making. Although he adhered faithfully to the Gothic principles of his master, and never strayed too far from the basic premise of most of Pugin's designs, he nevertheless had his own distinct style which gave his creations a somewhat softer appearance than Pugin's. While opinion of his inventiveness varies he was without doubt an extremely talented designer who worked effectively in the diverse fields of Hardman production and was a major contributor to the firm's continued success throughout the nineteenth century, some of his windows being particularly fine. Although energetic and hard-working he was of a retiring disposition and, unlike his Hardman relatives, took no part in public life beyond a small amount of lecturing, notably to the Birmingham School of Art, and rare excursions into print. During the mid-1880s he left Birmingham and settled at 12 Lee Road, Blackheath, Kent, in order to be able to superintend the firm's London office. He died at his home of pneumonia on 2 March 1895 and was buried in the chantry of The Grange, Ramsgate. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Birmingham Weekly Post</span> (9 March) described him as modest, amiable, and charming, and surviving likenesses show him as a slightly diminutive, dark-haired, and moustachioed figure. His second and eldest surviving son, Dunstan John Powell (1861&#150;1932), succeeded him as a partner and principal designer for the firm.<br>
<br>John Hardman Powell's brother William Powell appears to have been involved in the business from its earliest days, always on the metalwork side. He effectively took over control of that arm when it was divided from the glassworks in 1883 to form a distinct firm under the name Hardman, Powell &amp; Co. and moved to separate premises in King Edward's Road, Birmingham. The declining demand by the early twentieth century for the type of metalware the firm produced led to its reabsorption into John Hardman &amp; Co. in 1914, and, following family disagreements, to the eventual shedding of this aspect of the firm's business.<br>
<br>At its zenith in the third quarter of the nineteenth century John Hardman &amp; Co. could boast that it had supplied windows or church plate or other metal furniture to the majority of the Roman Catholic and Anglican parish churches of England and Wales besides a number in Ireland. It also exported to Australia, the USA, South Africa, and other destinations abroad. The firm's popularity declined in the twentieth century, and the last family member to be involved in the business, John Tarleton Hardman (1872&#150;1959), son of John Bernard Hardman, retired in 1935. The firm continues in existence, however, under different ownership and the slightly altered title of the John Hardman Studios, specializing in glasswork.<br>
