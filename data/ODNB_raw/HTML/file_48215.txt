<span class="headword">Clery,  William Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Austin Fryers]</span>  (1861&#150;1931), <span class="occ">trade unionist and writer</span>, was born in Ireland but emigrated to London in 1877 taking with him, as he later recalled, little more than his brogue. In 1888 he passed the civil service examination and became a sorter at the chief post office in St Martin's-le-Grand in the City of London. At the same time he began to write plays and to publish articles in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> under the <i>nom de plume</i> &#145;Austin Fryers&#146;, which he used for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>This was the period which saw the founding of numerous &#145;new&#146; unions, including for the various grades of Post Office workers, and involvement in union activities frequently resulted in dismissal, especially in the very traditionally minded Post Office. Clery's impulsive character brought him to the fore when the &#145;Fawcett Scheme Committee&#146; in April 1889 obtained support from London sorters by arguing that W. E. Gladstone's postmaster-general Henry Fawcett had promised in 1881 to improve their conditions to the level of those of telegraphists.<br>
<br>Clery published <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Fawcett Scheme</span> (1889), which brought a summons to meet tory postmaster-general Henry Raikes. Subsequently the authorities considered but did not accept the demands of the sorters while acknowledging the right to combine within the service. On 10 February 1890 the first number of the sorters' journal, <span class="italic">The Post</span>, appeared with Clery as editor and the Fawcett Association (FA) began with Clery as secretary.<br>
<br>The first trial for the new association came in July 1890 when the London postmen struck in defence of their union which was run by an &#145;outsider&#146;, J. L. Mahon. Clery did not want to get involved and initiated the sorters' decision to &#145;follow official routine&#146;  (Clinton, <span class="italic">DLB</span>) as the Postmen's Union was destroyed and 400 strikers were dismissed. After this defeat, postal workers achieved little in the following months. Clery then urged FA members to lobby candidates in the July 1892 general election, despite an explicit Post Office ban against such representations. Clery argued that they were only calling for an inquiry. However, when Postmaster-General Sir James Fergusson returned from the polls where the Conservatives were defeated, he dismissed Clery and his union colleague W. B. Cheesman for the crime of proposing and seconding the resolution advocating lobbying.<br>
<br>Clery and Cheesman immediately became full-time officials of the Fawcett Association, respectively as chairman and secretary, but they never got their jobs back, despite furious lobbying and many parliamentary discussions. In the next period while Cheesman ran the FA, Clery represented it on the London Trades Council, the Trades Union Congress, and elsewhere. He became interested in parliamentary representation, which he thought should be through the Liberal Party. He led the FA into becoming an early affiliate of the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. In 1902 he was adopted as Liberal&#150;Labour candidate for Deptford.<br>
<br>By this time, however, Clery's other interests were impinging on his trade union activities. He was an effective chairman of the FA during the 1890s, leading its rather conservative membership in many new directions. On 20 June 1897 he married the actress Elva Dearen. The FA tolerated Clery's extra-mural activities, but concern grew when his mounting personal debts were visited on the association itself in August 1902. In 1903 after a series of bitter and difficult disputes, Clery's Deptford candidature was repudiated and he lost his position in the FA.<br>
<br>During the following years, Clery continued to write plays, novels, and books about the theatre. These included <span class="italic">A Pauper Millionaire</span> (1899), <span class="italic">A Guide to the Stage</span> (1904), <span class="italic">A New Rip Van Winkle</span> (1905), and also a popular life of Henry Irving (1906). Clery became ill in 1911, and the FA awarded him a pension, an arrangement continued by the Union of Post Office Workers after 1920. He then disappeared from view, and was found in extreme poverty in February 1930. He wrote some articles about his early struggles and died on 20 October 1931 at 81 Lupus Street, Westminster, London. He was survived by his wife and a stepson. At his pauper's funeral, there was no representative of the trade union organizations which he had done so much to build. A pioneer of and &#145;martyr&#146; for Post Office trade unionism, Clery was also a journalist (he edited the <span class="italic">Crystal Palace Magazine</span>), popular novelist, playwright, and actor&#150;manager. His achievements in his many activities were tragically squandered and the admiration and loyalty he won were lost by dishonesty and self-deception. Yet after his death there was a moving obituary in <span class="italic">The Post</span>. G. H. Stuart-Binning, a former general secretary of the Postman's Federation, wrote that &#145;his courage was abundant to the point of recklessness &hellip; his personal fascination was amazing. Men would go to meetings determined to oppose him and come away having agreed to all he proposed&#146;  (Clinton, <span class="italic">DLB</span>).<br>
