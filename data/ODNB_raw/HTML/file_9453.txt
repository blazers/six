<span class="headword">Findlay, Sir  George</span>  (1829&#150;1893), <span class="occ">civil engineer and railway manager</span>, was born at Rainhill in Lancashire on 18 May 1829, the younger son of George Findlay (1793&#150;1858) of Grantown, Moray, and his wife, Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1835), daughter of Henry Courtenay of Glasgow. His father, descended from a family of small tenant farmers residing at Coltfield, near Elgin, became an inspector of masonry under George Stephenson, and at the time of his son's birth was engaged in building the famous skew bridge on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway near Rainhill. The younger George lived with his father successively at Liverpool, Coventry, and Halifax, where he attended the grammar school. At the age of fourteen he left school and worked as a mason on the Halifax branch of the Manchester and Leeds Railway, then in course of construction. From 1845 to 1847 he was assistant to his elder brother James, constructing bridges on the Trent Valley Railway. The brothers were employed by Thomas Brassey, who quickly appreciated George's abilities and, during an association which was to last for seventeen years, gave him opportunity to use them.<br>
<br>On the completion of the Trent valley line in 1847, Findlay travelled to London, and entered the service of the building contractors Bransome and Gwyther by whom he was employed as a mason in the construction of the London and North Western Railway's engine sheds at Camden Town and Chalk Farm. He subsequently joined the contractors Grissel and Peto and worked on the masonry of the new houses of parliament, then under construction. Before the end of 1847 he left London to work on the North Staffordshire Railway under Brassey's agent, Thomas Jones, on the construction of tunnels, tunnel entrances, and bridges. Before the close of 1849 Brassey appointed Findlay assistant engineer under his agent, Miles Day, in charge of the mining and brickwork of the Sutton Tunnel between Frodsham and Warrington, on the Birkenhead, Chester, and Cheshire Railway.<br>
<br>In 1850, when Messrs Brassey and Field began building the first section of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway between Hereford and Ludlow, Findlay was appointed engineer and superintended the construction. On its completion in April 1852 Brassey decided to lease and operate the line himself, and offered Findlay the post of manager, which he accepted after some hesitation. Brassey placed implicit confidence in Findlay, never interfering with his management of the railway and seldom troubling himself about the details of the accounts. In 1853 the railway reached Hereford, where it connected with the Newport, Abergavenny, and Hereford Railway operated by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Brassey contracted to supply the locomotive power on this line, and Findlay, as general manager of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway, began to work closely with the LNWR and to establish important contacts within that company.<br>
<br>In 1862 the LNWR and the Great Western Railway (GWR) took a joint lease of the Shrewsbury and Hereford line, and Findlay, who was largely responsible for negotiating this transaction, was taken on by the LNWR as their district manager for Shropshire and mid-Wales. With the concurrence of the LNWR board he also accepted the management of the various railways in mid- and south Wales and the marches operated by Thomas Savin. Savin had ambitious schemes of extension for these railways which Findlay increasingly thought unrealistic; furthermore, when Savin's lines merged to form the Cambrian Railways in July 1864 he saw the possibility of a conflict of interest with his work at the LNWR. In December 1864, he laid his views before Richard Moon, chairman of the LNWR, and procured transfer at the end of 1864 to Euston Station, where he was appointed general goods manager. In 1874 he was advanced to the post of general traffic manager, and in 1880, on the retirement of William Cawkwell, to that of general manager.<br>
<br>While at Euston, Findlay laid great emphasis on the importance of the LNWR's through traffic between mainland Britain and Ireland, and was largely responsible for the great development of traffic by the Dublin and Holyhead route. He was a familiar figure in parliamentary committee rooms and before royal commissions from 1854 onwards, and enjoyed the reputation of being an admirable witness. He was a strong opponent of the Manchester Ship Canal, appearing as an adverse witness on six occasions. In 1888 several of his suggestions were adopted by government as modifications of the policy in regard to Irish railways, recommended by the royal commission on Irish public works. He also contributed important evidence on behalf of the railways to the Board of Trade inquiry of 1889 into railway rates and charges. In 1891 he declined an invitation to be a member of the royal commission on the relations between capital and labour, but appeared before it as the chief witness on behalf of the railway companies. On the retirement of Sir Richard Moon in the same year, Findlay was offered the post of chairman of the London and North Western Company, but preferred to retain his more arduous position.<br>
<br>Findlay was well known as a lecturer on railway matters, and he developed a lecture entitled &#145;Working of an English railway&#146;, delivered at the Chatham School of Military Engineering, into <span class="italic">The Working and Management of an English Railway</span> (1889), which became one of the most widely studied and influential nineteenth-century books on railway management and operation, both in Britain and abroad; it reached a sixth edition in 1899.<br>
<br>Findlay was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 1 December 1874. He had a strong interest in the military applications of railways, and was a lieutenant-colonel of the engineer and railway volunteer staff corps; he was also a justice of the peace for Middlesex, and from 1889 an alderman of Middlesex county council. At the Paris Exhibition in 1889 he acted as vice-president of a committee dealing with the display of transportation technology, and was created a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He was knighted in 1892.<br>
<br>In his later days Findlay was the most prominent figure among railway managers in Britain. He had an admirable talent for organization and direction, and was capable of intense labour. His jocular remark to a committee of the House of Commons that he could manage all the railways in Ireland, and find time for two days' fishing a week, was based on no exaggerated estimate of his own capacity. He was twice married. With his first wife, Annie, daughter of Swanston Adamson of Rugeley in Staffordshire, he raised a large family, of whom four sons and two daughters survived him; she died in 1883. On 5 January 1885 he married Charlotte Jemima, daughter of Pryse Jacob of Bridgend, Glamorgan, who survived him.<br>
<br>Findlay died on 26 March 1893 at his home, Hill House, Edgware, Middlesex, and was buried at nearby Whitchurch on 30 March.<br>
