<span class="headword">Kirkcaldy, Sir  James, of Grange</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1556), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of William Kirkcaldy of Grange (Fife). Although less well-known than his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15660/', "Sir William Kirkcaldy (c.1520&#150;1573)")</script>, who was hanged for his championship of Queen Mary's cause, Sir James played an important part in the public affairs of mid-sixteenth-century Scotland. He was a prominent Fife laird, with lands and castles at Grange, near Burntisland, and Hallyards in Auchtertool parish. The latter was held from the bishop of Dunkeld and included the settlement of Newbigging which the king created a burgh of barony, with its market revenues, in 1541. Important land acquisitions had also come to Kirkcaldy on the forfeiture of Lord Glamis in 1537, including land in the barony of Kinghorn, Fife, which he transferred to his son William. In March 1538 the king granted him, jointly with the royal favourite Oliver Sinclair of Pitcairns, the wardship of the extensive lands of the earldom of Caithness.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy had a long career in the king's service. In the 1520s he took part with those who tried to detach the young James V from the power of the Douglases, and in August 1527 he had to pay for a remission for assisting the earl of Lennox in an attempt to do so. Described by Sir James Melville of Halhill (his brother-in-law) as &#145;a stout bold man&#146;  (Melville, 11) who was always prepared to back up his words with action, he frequently gave personal advice to the king and appears to have enjoyed the royal confidence. From the early 1530s he received livery clothes and fees as a gentleman of the king's chamber and trusted servant. He was among those who accompanied James to France in the autumn of 1536 for an extended visit during which the king married Princess Madeleine de Valois. In 1538 he was referred to as steward and in 1542 as a sewar (server at table) in the royal household.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy was made lord treasurer in 1538, entering office on 24 March. In September and December of that year he was an auditor of the accounts rendered by David Beaton, then abbot of Arbroath (later cardinal), who had handled the king's expenses in France in 1536&#150;7, though Kirkcaldy also appears to have had some financial responsibility during the king's time in France. As treasurer he was a regular witness of royal charters and other important state transactions. He frequently acted as an auditor of the exchequer accounts rendered by his financial colleague the comptroller. His responsibilities for the king's finances overlapped with those of the royal pursemaster, but he is recorded as personally supervising and handling the transfer of money to and from the king's coffers; in 1542 he gave &pound;2520 to John Barton to buy munitions in Denmark. Like other officers of state he found that his salary often fell into arrears. On 21 February 1540 he and the comptroller were awarded the sum of &pound;333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. arrears of fees. Kirkcaldy retained his post of treasurer for some months after James's death (on 14 December 1542), and rendered his final account on 13 August 1543.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy's identification with those who wished both closer alliance with England and serious reform of the church had already made him a particular target for the resentment of Cardinal David Beaton and his fellow prelates, especially since his close relationship with the king made it difficult for them to apprehend him on a charge of heresy. Both Melville and John Knox recounted that in 1540, when the clergy presented James with a long list of suspected heretics whom he might prosecute and forfeit, the king declined to act on the allegations because of Kirkcaldy's counsel. Kirkcaldy is said to have encouraged James to meet Henry VIII at York in 1541, a plan that was undermined by the cardinal, and after the king's death Kirkcaldy was one of those who encouraged James Hamilton, earl of Arran, to assume the sole governorship, &#145;when as he appeared to be a true gospeller&#146;  (Melville, 20).<br>
<br>Even before the act of parliament of 1543 (passed during the cardinal's detention) which sanctioned the use of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in English, Kirkcaldy was said to have carried an English <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in his pouch. He associated with some of those who most strongly advocated religious reform, such as his father-in-law, Sir John Melville, and Henry Balnaves, author of a theological treatise on the doctrine of justification, who became his colleague as treasurer's clerk. In July 1544 Kirkcaldy was one of the associates of the Earl Marischal (soon to give public support to the reformer George Wishart) who were given letters of protection during the Earl Marischal's absence in France; others included the lairds of Fyvie, Philorth, and Pittarrow, and Henry Balnaves, all at one time or another suspected or accused of heresy. The clergy took their revenge on Kirkcaldy by persuading Governor Arran to deprive him of the treasurership (before 13 August 1543, when the office was said to be vacant), and it was granted instead to Arran's kinsman John Hamilton, abbot of Paisley and later archbishop of St Andrews. Balnaves was likewise deprived of the clerkship to the treasury. However, in summer 1543 Cardinal Beaton used Kirkcaldy as a mediator with the latter's allies, the earl of Rothes, Lord Gray, and Balnaves, when they were accused of obstructing the governor's journey to Dundee; and Arran himself continued to communicate with Kirkcaldy over the backlog of business from his time as treasurer and as late as 22 April 1545 sent him more than &pound;900&#151;owed as &#145;superexpenses&#146; on his final account.<br>
<br>With his son William and others, Kirkcaldy was involved in the plot against Cardinal Beaton, and he joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69953/', "castilians")</script> in St Andrews the day after the assassination, carried out on 29 May 1546. For this he was forfeited and his property granted to various persons, including the now reinstated Lord Glamis, from whose forfeiture Kirkcaldy had earlier benefited. On 4 September 1546 his tenants at Grange and Hallyards were warned to hand over any of his goods in their possession or be reckoned participants in his crimes. On the fall of St Andrews Castle in summer 1547 Kirkcaldy was among those Scots taken prisoner to France, first to Cherbourg, where he and his fellow captives refused to attend mass, and then to Mont-St Michel, from where some of them escaped. Kirkcaldy had advised against the escape attempt, fearing that those left behind would be more severely treated. He served for a time in the French galleys before being released with other Scots, partly on the intercession of Mary of Guise, queen dowager of Scotland, in July 1550. Kirkcaldy died in 1556. According to Knox, the family's forfeiture was reduced by parliament in 1563 (there is no official record of this), and his son Sir William was &#145;retoured&#146; (recognized as successor) on 4 May 1564.<br>
<br>Kirkcaldy married Janet, daughter of Sir John Melville of Raith, by about 1520. They had five recorded sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15660/', "Sir William Kirkcaldy")</script>, the heir; James (who was hanged with William after the surrender of Edinburgh Castle in 1573); David; Thomas; and George. Their four recorded daughters were Marjory, who about 1540 was contracted to marry Sir Henry Ramsay of Colluthie; Agnes, by 1542 married, as his first wife, to Sir Robert Drummond of Carnock; Marion, married by 10 January 1541 to William, son of Gabriel Semple of Cathcart; and Elizabeth, married to Sir John Mowbray of Barnbougle. Janet Melville, who survived her husband, petitioned parliament in 1546 to be allowed to keep her terce lands despite his forfeiture. The lady of Grange who gave hospitality to James V at Hallyards on his last journey to Falkland at the end of 1542, and who was described by Knox as &#145;an ancient godly matron&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 1.38), may have been Kirkcaldy's mother, as Janet Melville could hardly have been elderly when, after her husband's forfeiture in 1546, she and &#145;sevin of hir bairnis&#146; were dependent on the charity of her father, who was alive until December 1548  (Fraser, 3.89).<br>
