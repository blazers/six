<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Smart,  Elizabeth</span>  (1913&#150;1986), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 27 December 1913 in Ottawa, Canada, the third child and third daughter in the family of four daughters (one of whom died in infancy) and one son of Russel Sutherland Smart, a prominent Ottawa lawyer specializing in patents, and his wife, Emma Louise (Louie), daughter of James Alexander Parr, executive in the Montreal Telegraph Company. She grew up in affluent circumstances in Ottawa and Kingsmere, where the family had a second house on a lake. She was educated at Ottawa normal school, Elmwood School, and Hatfield Hall in Cobourg, with the exception of one year during which she was obliged to lie in bed with a heart condition, and there began to write. She vacillated between becoming a musician or a writer, and did not go to university. She travelled around the world under the eye of a family friend. In London she studied to become a professional pianist with Katharine Goodson, but with the confidence born of what she called the &#145;huge luckiness&#146; of her childhood she reacted against the hollowness of her social life and broke away to travel around the world, always gravitating towards artistic rebels. Although she had studied music for thirteen years and played the piano very well she never played again. She lived on an allowance from her father.<br>
<br>Smart expressed her adventurous, romantic nature to the full when, after reading the poems of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49571/', "George Granville Barker")</script> in a Charing Cross bookshop, she promptly fell in love with the poet, who was then working unhappily in Japan. He was the son of George Barker, formerly of the Coldstream Guards, a butler at Gray's Inn. In 1940 she invited Barker and his wife to Canada, raising the cash herself for both their fares, and they then moved to Monterey, California, where she was living. This was the pivotal act of her life: it resulted in a passion-wracked affair, which began in July 1940 and produced four children and her extraordinary novel <span class="italic">By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept</span>, which she completed in 1941. First published in August 1945 by Tambimuttu just before the end of the Second World War her novel (or narrative prose poem) remained largely unnoticed in the fray, although Cyril Connolly gave it a certain grudging admiration in <span class="italic">Horizon</span>.<br>
<br>After the birth of her first love child, a girl, in 1941, Smart went to England in 1943 on a convoy which was torpedoed. Shortly afterwards she produced a son with Barker, whose wife had twins five weeks later. The rigours of bringing up a family with very little money (she was still reliant on an allowance from her father), and without a permanent father figure, gagged her muse, but she became more settled when she moved to a mill house in Essex. She wrote intermittently about the aftermath of her grand passion, but, understandably under the circumstances, her productivity was low. She had another of Barker's sons in 1945 and a daughter in 1947.<br>
<br>From 1949 to 1951 Smart was a sub-editor on <span class="italic">House and Garden</span>. Separated from Barker, who eventually had fifteen children with different women, she had occasional affairs. By the mid-1950s she supported her family by writing advertising copy. Her large flat at 9 Westbourne Terrace was a centre for London bohemians, many of them distinguished remnants from the old Soho &#145;Fitzrovia&#146; days (the painters Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde, Patrick Swift, and Craigie Aitchison; the poets Patrick Kavanagh and W. S. Graham; and the inspired drifter Jeffrey Bernard). In 1957, with Agnes Ryan, she published <span class="italic">Cooking the French Way</span>. Her life began to pick up considerably in 1964 as the children grew up and she began writing for the sparkling new magazine <span class="italic">Queen</span>, a job she held until 1966.<br>
<br>In 1966 Smart's novel was republished by Panther Books in a silver paperback, with an introduction by Brigid Brophy, who described it as one of the half-dozen masterpieces in the world:<blockquote>The entire book is a wound. Even when its rhythm expresses the throb of pleasure, the pleasure is so ardent it lays waste the personality which experiences it &hellip; it is one of the most shelled, skinned, nerve-exposed books ever written.</blockquote>But some critics continued to be affronted by such a metaphor-laden, raw, female emotion, the eternal wail of a woman for her demon lover, and took their refuge in accusations of purple prose, discounting the passages of searing humour.After her younger daughter became involved with drugs Smart often had full responsibility for the daughter's two children, and she soon moved to a cottage near Bungay, Suffolk, where she became absorbed in creating a garden and writing poetry. She aimed for Blakean simplicity, which did not appeal to the poetry mafia of the period. However, her first collection, <span class="italic">A Bonus</span>, was published in 1977 and she began to give poetry readings. The publication of <span class="italic">The Assumption of the Rogues and Rascals</span> in 1978, her long-brewing aftermath novel, and the Canadian publication of her dazzling memoirs, <span class="italic">In the Meantime</span> (1984), reinforced her growing reputation. Meanwhile the now famous early book was translated into many languages and became something of a cult novel. In 1982 she spent a year as writer in residence at the University of Alberta.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Smart had occasional affairs with both men and women. She was a great beauty, not only in the classical blonde, blue-eyed, well-featured sense, but because of a radiance which, even later, ravaged by age and empathy, could draw so many people to her. She was a bohemian in the best sense of the word, and died on 4 March 1986, of a heart attack, in her son Christopher's flat in the Soho where she had spent so many hours in conviviality, good talk, and freedom from hypocritical moral restraints. Her younger daughter had died from drug taking in 1982. Her journals were posthumously published as <span class="italic">Necessary Secrets</span> in 1986.<br>
