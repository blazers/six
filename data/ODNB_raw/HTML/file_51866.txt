<span class="headword">Eason,  Ursula Vernon</span>  (1910&#150;1993), <span class="occ">broadcaster and broadcasting executive</span>, was born on 19 August 1910 in Streatham, London, the fifth of six children of Edward Eason, auctioneer and surveyor, and his wife, Aisling (Nancy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bruton (<i>d</i>. 1967), from a well-known Gloucester family of auctioneers. She was educated at Mount Nod School, Streatham, and University College, London, where she took a good degree in English. After a secretarial course she worked for nine months at the Times Book Club as secretary to the assistant manager.<br>
<br>Eason had always loved the theatre and enjoyed acting, so she applied to the BBC, where she was interviewed by John Reith. In an interview report she was described as &#145;a practical, sensible, nice-looking 23-year-old&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 Jan 1994) and she was offered a post in 1934 as children's hour organizer in Belfast, where she stayed for eighteen years. There she became a producer and head of the children's hour unit. She took part in the programmes as Auntie Phoebe and was also responsible for all gramophone transmissions from Belfast. In spite of her attempts to return to London she remained based in Belfast, and when many male staff left for war service she was made acting programme director, planning and producing all the output from BBC Northern Ireland. After the war she had become so indispensable that it was not until 1952 that she was transferred to London and the growing television service.<br>
<br>Eason was attached first to television talks, then to the film unit, and in 1953 to children's programmes. In 1955 she became assistant head of the department and stayed in the same post until she retired in 1970. Her knowledge of the BBC and her dedication to public service made her invaluable to the producers and to the four heads under whom she served: Freda Lingstrom, Owen Reed, Doreen Stephens, and Monica Sims. A more selfish or ambitious person might have resented the people who were promoted over her head but she supported them all loyally. Her wisdom was greatly appreciated and was influential in maintaining the high standards that she felt children deserved. She loved and respected the audience and encouraged young producers to recognize their responsibility to respond to the individual needs of children at different stages of development.<br>
<br>Eason had some hearing difficulties herself and was particularly concerned for deaf children. In 1953 she created a monthly programme, <span class="italic">For Deaf Children</span>, with the co-operation of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID). In 1964, with the imaginative contribution of the producer Patrick Dowling, she introduced the weekly series <span class="italic">Vision On</span>. This was directed to the whole audience, not solely to deaf children, and was one of the first truly visual programmes, not depending on words for comprehension. Original cartoons, mime, dance, drama, drawing, and painting drew on all the techniques available at the time. The programme won the top prize for the best children's programme at the Prix Jeunesse. The presenter was Pat Keysell, who used sign language and later was a founder of the British Theatre of the Deaf. Some teachers objected to signing, but with the support of the RNID and the National Deaf Children's Society it later became familiar to audiences in many theatres. <span class="italic">Vision On</span> invited children to send in their art work, stimulated by the creations of the artist Tony Hart, who displayed selections each week from the thousands entered. The shoestring budget for the programme led to many experimental forms of animation, including the plasticene man, Morph, who was the forerunner of Wallace and Gromit of the Aardmann Studios in Bristol.<br>
<br>Humour was essential in a department steeped in different theories of child psychology and arguments between idealistic producers. It was Eason's throaty chuckle that could produce a calmer sense of proportion. Her well-founded good taste and experience informed her judgement of programmes and of people. Thus she dismissed the saccharine sweetness of a French puppet series but recognized its potential value, if given an astringent sound track. <span class="italic">The Magic Roundabout</span>, with commentary by Eric Thompson, subsequently became one of the series best loved by both adults and children, and a cult on building sites and in university common rooms. In purchasing American series she rejected violence and bad language or any assumptions in which villains were shown as black people or foreigners.<br>
<br>Eason's tall, handsome appearance and modestly diffident manner could camouflage her keen intellect and firm moral outlook; her retirement robbed the BBC of a distinguished public servant. In private life she enjoyed family gatherings at her beautiful Georgian house on Kew Green, travelling in India and the Middle East, and working for charities and deaf people. She died in Kew on Christmas day 1993, a few years after the onset of Alzheimer's disease, and was cremated at Mortlake. She never married.<br>
