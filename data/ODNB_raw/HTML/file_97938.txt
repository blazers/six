<span class="headword">Tremayne family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1741&#150;1901), <span class="occ">politicians and gardeners</span>, were wealthy Cornwall and Devon landowners whose seat was at Heligan, near St Austell in Cornwall. Their earlier lineage included the lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27692/', "Sir John Tremayne")</script>. The Tremaynes were deeply involved in Cornish electoral politics during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, two being elected as tories to the House of Commons. Over three generations they developed the exotic gardens at Heligan, which, overgrown and &#145;lost&#146; after the First World War, were rediscovered and gradually restored to public view from 1990 onwards.<br>
<br>The pleasure gardens surrounding the older household gardens at Heligan were developed by <a name="cosubject_97939"></a><span class="headword">Henry Hawkins Tremayne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1829)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at St Ewe, Cornwall, on 17 July 1741, the second son of John Tremayne and his wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hawkins. Educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and Balliol College, Oxford, from where he matriculated in May 1759, graduated BA in 1763, and proceeded MA in 1765, he was destined for a career in the church and was ordained deacon in 1766. His fortunes were changed by the death in that year of his elder unmarried brother, which made him heir to the Heligan estate. In 1767 he married Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1805), daughter and co-heir of John Hearle, a former vice-warden of the stannaries who owned extensive property in Penryn. In 1808 a further inheritance brought him the Tremayne estates at Sydenham in Devon.<br>
<br>This accumulated wealth allowed Tremayne to commission improvements at Heligan, including removing the parterre gardens introduced by earlier generations. He planned on a much bigger scale than hitherto, his first step being to plant protective shelter belts of conifers on the western and eastern boundaries. In 1785 he visited numerous gardens elsewhere in central and southern England, including Blenheim, Stowe, and Hestercombe near Taunton. Following this tour the landscape gardener Thomas Gray embellished and refined an earlier formal plan (1735) for the gardens at Heligan. Influenced by this, and perhaps by Humphry Repton who was in Cornwall in the 1790s, Tremayne proceeded to lay out the northern gardens, building two walled gardens (one of them for flowers), glasshouses, and a pineapple pit, which remains the only one of its type surviving in Europe.<br>
<br>Tremayne combined his landowning, mining, and gardening interests with a close involvement in local politics. He was a tory and his activities may have been influenced by his brother-in-law Charles Rashleigh, a solicitor, who was a fierce opponent of the political ambitions of Sir Francis Basset and of Cornwall's whig reformers. During the 1770s and 1780s Tremayne was on several occasions mayor of Penryn, where he openly opposed Basset's briefly successful attempts to control the borough's parliamentary representation. He also voted against Basset's preferred candidate in the hotly contested county election of 1790, being one of the most prominent supporters of the victorious Francis Gregor, a follower of Pitt. Tremayne's political opinions were highly respected, and were sought by his fellow tories. On at least one occasion (in 1791) he chaired a protest meeting of those involved in the pilchard fisheries, and he attended several important county meetings from the 1770s onwards. Tremayne, who died at Heligan on 10 February 1829, was renowned for being charitable to all: &#145;his numerous tenantry knew him as their kindest and best friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">West Briton</span>, 20 Feb 1829).<br>
<br>He left an estate of more than 10,000 acres in Devon and Cornwall to his only son, <a name="cosubject_97940"></a><span class="headword">John Hearle Tremayne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1780, <em>d.</em> 1851)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at St Ewe, Cornwall, on 17 March 1780. Better known as a politician than as a gardener, he was educated at Eton College (1793&#150;6) and Christ Church, Oxford, from where he matriculated in 1798 and graduated BA in 1802. He was elected unopposed in 1806 as one of Cornwall's two county MPs, replacing Francis Gregor. Tremayne retained his seat without opposition until 1826 when, facing a certain contest, he retired on the eve of the poll. This decision, which allowed a whig reformer to take his place, was deplored by many tories. While he was regarded as the personification of the independent country gentleman, Tremayne usually voted with the administration of the day, and he opposed both Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. He was also a watchful defender of the interests of the pilchard fisheries of the south-west.<br>
<br>On 11 January 1813 Tremayne married Caroline Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1864), ninth and youngest daughter of Sir William Lemon, first baronet, of Carclew, a whig, and Tremayne's fellow county MP. They had three sons and three daughters. Tremayne's lifelong connection with the politically powerful Lemon family, and especially his brother-in-law Charles, Lemon's only surviving son, weakened Cornwall's tories for more than a generation. From 1826 onwards family loyalties overrode political imperatives. Once Sir Charles Lemon, second baronet (1784&#150;1868), became MP for West Cornwall in 1832 (the county was divided into two divisions by the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>), the Tremayne family's tory connections ensured that his seat was never threatened. On several occasions after 1832 Tremayne himself was approached to stand for either the East or West division, but always declined. Tremayne was a magistrate, a deputy lieutenant, and high sheriff of Cornwall in 1831.<br>
<br>Tremayne's principal contribution to the Heligan gardens was to continue to implement the plan developed by his father. He created the long drive from the nearby village of Pentewan, planting many ornamental trees, and also in 1832 an avenue of <i>Cornus capitata</i>, a small tree with butter lemon flowers, few of which have survived. The seeds were collected in Nepal and supplied by his cousin, Sir Anthony Buller, who served as a judge on the Bengal bench from 1816 to 1827 and sat as MP for West Looe. Tremayne also began clearing the area known as the Jungle, a subtropical valley garden south-east of the house where he planted <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i> Lobbii, named after the Cornish plant hunter Thomas Lobb. After a visit to Heligan in 1841 the young Quaker Robert Barclay Fox praised the tasteful way in which the gardens had been laid out, and the vistas. John Hearle Tremayne died on 27 August 1851 at Dawlish railway station in Devon.<br>
<br>His eldest son and heir, <a name="cosubject_97941"></a><span class="headword">John Tremayne</span>  (1825&#150;1901)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in London on 15 April 1825 and educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford; he matriculated in 1843 and graduated BA in 1847. Early in life he was the victim of a crippling bone disease, after which he had to walk with the assistance of canes. He shared his father's dedication to public service: he was a magistrate, deputy lieutenant for Cornwall and Devon, and high sheriff of Cornwall in 1859. On 13 November 1860 he married the Hon. Mary Charlotte Martha (<i>d</i>. 1917), daughter of Charles Crespigny Vivian, second Baron Vivian, a well-known Liberal. They had one son, Jack, and three daughters.<br>
<br>John Tremayne's Lemon family connection delayed his entry into parliament; although he and his brother Arthur Tremayne (1827&#150;1905) were sought after as prospective Conservative candidates, they were restrained by Sir Charles Lemon from contesting county seats. Following Lemon's death in 1868 (Arthur Tremayne was his sole heir) John Tremayne re-organized the fissiparous East Cornwall Conservatives, healing long-standing rifts and then, with the support of the politically fickle farmers, was elected in the 1874 general election. When the farmers withdrew their support in 1880 Tremayne was defeated, as he was again in a by-election in 1882. He represented South Devon in 1884&#150;5.<br>
<br>Like his grandfather and father John Tremayne left his imprint on the gardens at Heligan, most notably as a collector and hybridizer of rhododendrons. Sir Charles Lemon, who had noted gardens at Carclew, was one of Sir Joseph Hooker's sponsors for his 1847&#150;9 expedition to Nepal and Sikkim. Returning to England in 1851 Hooker brought back new rhododendron seeds and seedlings, some of which were given to Lemon to plant. He in turn passed on a selection to Tremayne. Many of the original species, including <i>R. arboreum</i>, <i>R. aucklandii</i>, <i>R. hodgsoni</i>, and <i>R. niveum</i>, were planted close to the house, adjoining and between the walled gardens. Hybrids were planted around the rim of the area known as Flora's Green and elsewhere in the gardens, making a spectacular display. Tremayne also added conifers to the shelter belts and elsewhere, including <i>Pinus montezeumae</i> given by Jonathan Rashleigh, as well as lilies, yuccas, camellias, magnolias, and a gingko. In 1880 he installed three hydraulic ram pumps, which supplied water for the gardens from a 40,000 gallon reservoir.<br>
<br>The Jungle was further developed, with a second pond being added. Tree ferns imported from New South Wales by members of the Treseder family (well-known nurserymen) were widely planted, together with bamboos, Chusan palms, and such taller trees as a New Zealand yew. In the 1890s, when increasing frailty meant he was carried through the gardens in a wheeled chair drawn by a donkey, Tremayne constructed the Ravine, a large-scale Alpine themed rockery one hundred yards long and twenty feet deep, where ash, sycamore, ferns, and primroses were planted. Elsewhere Tremayne successfully introduced <i>Eriobotrya japonica</i>, an Asian shrub of the rose family brought from the south of France; he and his son also began planning the secluded Italian Garden. On his death, at Biarritz on 7 April 1901, a correspondent recalled his half-century involvement in county business, his handsome presence, courtly manners, and liberality; he epitomized &#145;a Tory country gentleman of the old school&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 April 1901).<br>
<br>The estate passed to his only son, John Claude Lewis (Jack) Tremayne (1869&#150;1949), who shared his father's enthusiasm for hybridizing. He added a third pond and waterfall to the Jungle, the pond being deliberately obscured by the huge leaves of <i>Gunnera mannicata</i> (giant rhubarb), and completed the Italian Garden with its summer house, and a pool rimmed by Mediterranean style garden beds. His marriage, on 18 November 1897, to Eleanor Elizabeth, daughter of Jonathan Rashleigh of Menabilly, Cornwall, and a former high sheriff of the county, &#145;had been looked forward to by the relatives on both sides&#146;. But on his father's death Jack Tremayne deserted his wife amid public revelations about changes to his father's will unfavourable to his wife and any of her descendants. Disobeying a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, Jack Tremayne was divorced by his wife in 1904  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 June 1904). After 1918 he lived mostly in Italy. Heligan, which was used as a convalescent home for officers in the First World War, was leased to families who could not afford to maintain the gardens in their entirety. Following Jack Tremayne's death in 1949, childless, the Heligan gardens became even more overgrown and neglected. Restored, and a major tourist attraction, the gardens are owned by a trust established for descendants of the Tremayne family.<br>
