<span class="headword">Newell,  Robert</span>  (1576&#150;1642), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Westminster, the son of Robert Newell (<i>d</i>. 1602) and Sybil Neile (<i>d</i>. 1611), who had been married at St Margaret's, Westminster, in April 1575. His mother had three surviving sons from her first marriage to Paul Neile, William, Walter, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19861/', "Richard Neile (1562&#150;1640)")</script>, who had a distinguished career in the church which benefited Newell greatly. Educated first at Westminster School, Newell matriculated from Richard's college, St John's, Cambridge, about 1595 and graduated BA in 1597. Possibly through the influence of the Cecil family, Neile's patrons, in 1599 he became rector of Wormley, Hertfordshire. The following year he proceeded MA, was incorporated with Neile at Oxford, and on 26 October was ordained priest in London by John Sterne, suffragan bishop of Colchester, with letters testimonial provided by Neile and William Baylie, archdeacon of Peterborough.<br>
<br>In 1605 Newell became vicar of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, a Cecil living which he took over from Neile on the latter's promotion to the deanery of Westminster. It was through Dean Neile (from 1608 also bishop of Rochester) that he gained his first significant clerical appointments&#151;in 1607 the reversion to a canonry in Westminster and, on his resignation of Wormley in 1610, the rectory of Islip, Oxfordshire, a living in the gift of the dean and chapter of Westminster. Following Neile's translation to Lichfield also in 1610, the same year Newell took a Chichester prebend and succeeded his stepbrother as treasurer of Chichester Cathedral (although he seems to have regarded both as sinecures), and also gained from him the Lichfield prebend of Pipa Parva; he exchanged the last for the wealthier prebend of Colwich in 1613. On 17 September 1612 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, he married Elizabeth Clarke, sister of Gabriel Clarke, one of Neile's chaplains and later archdeacon of Durham; they had five children&#151;Sybil, Richard, Dorothy, Elizabeth, and John.<br>
<br>When it was rumoured in 1614 that he might gain the living of Clifton Campville, which eventually went to John Overall, Newell was described as a royal chaplain. On Neile's translation to Lincoln the same year Newell duly gained a Lincoln prebend and became subdean of the cathedral. That April&#151;on Neile's collation&#151;he attained his most important clerical position, that of archdeacon of Buckingham, a post he held until his death. Again in 1614, Cecil family patronage accounted for his appointment as rector of Clothall, Hertfordshire. In October 1620 Neile, now bishop of Durham, gave Newell a Durham prebend, but there is little evidence that he ever resided either in Durham or Buckinghamshire, where, presumably through local gentry patronage, he also acquired the rectory of North Crawley in 1631. Instead he concentrated on his duties at Westminster, where he finally took possession of his prebend in April 1620; he resigned his Chichester prebend in 1622. He always took his work at the abbey seriously and was part of a group of canons led by Peter Heylin who took over its running after the sequestration of Dean John Williams in 1637.<br>
<br>While Newell undoubtedly benefited from the patronage of his illustrious stepbrother, he appears to have been an able and efficient clergyman in his own right. He served Neile conscientiously when the latter was dean of Westminster and appears to have moved out of his stepbrother's shadow most effectively when in the diocese of Lincoln. It was the latter diocese which seems to have claimed his affections, for his will notes bequests to Lincoln of communion pots and &pound;1000 for the cathedral fabric fund. He also made generous provision for the poor of various places, particularly Clothall, in memory of his wife's family. John Clarke, a fellow Lincolnshire minister, dedicated his <span class="italic">Holy Oil for the Lamps of the Sanctuary</span> to Newell in 1628. Records of the archdeaconry of Buckinghamshire, including his surviving visitation returns for 1626, 1627, 1630, 1635, 1637, and 1639, suggest that he shared Neile's interest in observing all church ceremonies with due order and dignity, and in aptly fitted surroundings. They reveal a man concerned for order and ceremony, one who insisted that people should receive communion kneeling.<br>
<br>Newell was still treasurer of Chichester Cathedral, when he died on 21 June 1642 at Winchester; he was buried in Winchester Cathedral. His will, not proved until 1646, suggests that he died relatively well off, for he left several hundred pounds each to various members of the extended Neile/Newell family, including Gabriel Clarke, John Neile, and Edward Burby, with whom he was probably staying when he died. His wife had predeceased him. Their elder son, Richard, successively a member of three Cambridge colleges, Emmanuel, St John's, and Peterhouse, at the last of which he was a fellow from 1639 to 1642, followed his father into the church. He succeeded his father as subdean of Lincoln Cathedral in 1641, but was sequestered shortly before his death in 1645.<br>
