<span class="headword">Kettle,  Arnold Charles</span>  (1916&#150;1986), <span class="occ">literary critic</span>, was born in 74 Mayfield Avenue, Ealing, Middlesex, on 17 March 1916, the first of the two sons of Charles Mansfield Kettle (1877&#150;1960), manager of a baker's shop in Finchley Road, South Hampstead, where the family lived, and his wife, Ethel Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barry. Both Charles Kettle's sons had remarkably successful academic careers, Arnold in particular. Between 1928 and 1934 he was a pupil at Merchant Taylors' School before becoming an undergraduate at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He took a first in the historical tripos in his second year and a first in the English tripos the following year and then moved on to become a research student. During Kettle's time at Cambridge, F. R. Leavis was one of the strongest influences on undergraduates reading English and Leavis's ideas confirmed and reinforced the direction Kettle had begun to follow. Kettle did not share Leavis's firm anti-Marxist opinions, however: by 1936 he had joined the Communist Party and remained a member for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Kettle was elected a Commonwealth fellow in 1939 and spent the next two years studying at Yale University. He returned to England and was awarded his PhD in January 1942 for his thesis, &#145;The relation of political and social ideas in the novel of the English Romantic revival&#146;. Once again the direction of Kettle's interests was set and the effect of social policy and development, together with their expression in the novel, was to occupy him for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>When Kettle returned from America the Second World War was still raging and he joined the Royal Corps of Signals, rising to the rank of captain and seeing service in Yugoslavia, Italy, and India. He was demobilized in 1946 and, on 30 January 1946, married Marguerite Rosabelle Carritt, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gale (1915/16&#150;1995) (who from childhood was always known as Margot). They had two sons. Although he was happily married Kettle was bisexual and throughout his life he never fully came to terms with his situation. Doris Lessing in her autobiography <span class="italic">Walking in the Shade</span> (1997) claims that one reason for his constant loyalty to the Communist Party was that they stood by him and were not prejudiced by his bisexuality.<br>
<br>In 1946 Kettle was appointed as a supervisor at Cambridge where extra staff were needed to teach the undergraduates arriving in large numbers after service in the forces whose studies had been held back for up to six years by the war. He did not stay long in the post of supervisor and in 1947 he was appointed senior lecturer in the English department at Leeds University where Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e was head. The school of English at Leeds began to expand and continued to grow during Kettle's time there, especially under Professor A. N. Jeffares, with courses in linguistics, folk life studies, and Commonwealth literature. It began to attract applications from overseas, particularly from Africa and India. Kettle played an important role in teaching these overseas students. He had a profound influence on many, notably Dipak Nandy from India, and Wole Soyinka and Ngugi wa Thiong'o (James Ngugi) from Africa.<br>
<br>At this stage in his career Kettle was not a prolific author of scholarly publications but his most significant book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the English Novel</span>, appeared in two volumes in 1951 and 1953, with a paperback issue in 1962 and a second edition in 1967; there were translations into Serbo-Croat (1959), Russian (1966), and Japanese (1974). Angus Calder wrote of the book, &#145;[it] has persuaded generations of readers that what it says is simple common sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 27 Dec 1986). Among his other publications from his time at Leeds were two chapters in the <span class="italic">Pelican History of English Literature</span> (6, 1958; 7, 1961) and a collection of essays which he edited, <span class="italic">Shakespeare in a Changing World</span> (1964). Scholarly work and university teaching, though, represented only some of his interests and he taught several courses for the Workers' Educational Association in Yorkshire where he was active in the local Communist Party. His commitment to Marxism was constant but it never obtruded into his teaching. On meeting a new group of students he would simply say, &#145;I am sure you all know what my politics are&#146;, and after that he would leave it to them to deduce why certain interpretations of a work were being stressed, or more likely, why others were not being mentioned at all.<br>
<br>What some have seen as a paradox is that a man so sensitive to the subtleties of literature, who could bring new insights to books which nobody had noticed before, could also accept, or at least remain silent about, Stalinism, the suppression of the Hungarian uprising, and the most unsubtle brutalities taking place in the name of communism. In fact, only Kettle and John Gollan, the general secretary, at a Communist Party executive meeting in 1956 voted against a motion to support the Russians in their invasion of Hungary. Because democratic centralism was the rule, neither of them afterwards ever revealed his true opinion.<br>
<br>It was probably Kettle's view that Marxism was fundamentally correct and even if those in control of communist regimes were corrupt, the truth of communism was not affected. He certainly had absolute loyalty to causes he espoused, commitments which went back to early manhood and remained with him all his life. Such commitment may also in retrospect make him seem cold and heartless, but nothing could be further from the truth and all who knew him spoke of his generosity. He was generous with his time and with praise for students' work, with his hospitality to friends and students, and he was unstinting in helping anyone he saw as disadvantaged.<br>
<br>One example of this occurred in the spring of 1956 when Kettle was visiting Czechoslovakia as a member of a delegation. He had one day free and was asked what he would like to do. He said he would like to visit his old friend Marion Slingova. After a show trial in 1948 Marion Slingova's husband had been executed and by 1956 she had been released from prison but to prolong the humiliation she had been given work in a village factory making bicycle wheels. An official car was provided to take Kettle to the village, Marion Slingova was called out of the factory, and they embraced in the centre of the village. The communist officials and the villagers, some of whom thought Kettle was the British ambassador, were amazed, but Kettle's spontaneous action subsequently brought about some improvement in her conditions.<br>
<br>A member of the national executive committee of the Communist Party, Kettle was never a politician in the public eye but preferred to work quietly in the background. He was on the editorial board of <span class="italic">Marxism Today</span>, as well as being a regular contributor, from its foundation in October 1957 and he wrote many articles for the Communist Party national newspaper the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>, which later became the <span class="italic">Morning Star</span>. He also published reviews and articles in other left-wing periodicals such as the <span class="italic">Marxist Quarterly</span> and <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span>. In 1963 probably his most important political publication appeared, <span class="italic">Karl Marx, Founder of Modern Communism</span>; it generated a second edition in 1968 and translations into Norwegian (1966), Italian (1972), and Swedish (1976).<br>
<br>In 1967 Kettle was seconded by Leeds University to the University of Dar es Salaam as professor of literature to run the new department and to help with the division of the University of East Africa into three separate institutions for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Three years later he was appointed to the Open University as its first professor of literature. Arnold Kettle's experience and approach to teaching were exactly what was needed to launch the Open University. The Open University in turn undoubtedly satisfied him because it had a clear, practical aim&#151;to educate anybody who enrolled. There were no entry requirements and thus the academics were forced to explain their subjects in everyday terms. Kettle had always adopted this approach and, although he had read the abstruse philosophical and literary theoretical Marxist treatises, he never brought any high-flown theories into his own work. He never saw himself as a literary critic but always as a teacher trying to explain how a novel, play, or poem was moulded by the historical circumstances in which it was written, and at the same time, if it was a great work, how it could still be relevant to modern life. And if he could explain this to a bus driver or a housewife, if he could bring out the full relevance of the work to them in person and let it change their lives, so much the better.<br>
<br>Because of the multi-disciplinary approach, at least in the undergraduate foundation course, Kettle's contribution to Open University teaching covers a much wider range than his previous concentration on the English novel. For example, there is a unit on Stendhal's <span class="italic">Scarlet and Black</span>, and one, highly regarded, on Mozart's <span class="italic">Marriage of Figaro</span>. Nevertheless, Open University courses did not take all his time and other academic publications continued to appear, such as <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century Novel: Critical Essays and Documents</span> (1972) and &#145;W. H. Auden: poetry and politics in the thirties&#146; in <span class="italic">Culture and Crisis in Britain in the Thirties</span> (1979). Recognition of his abilities and achievements at the Open University came in 1973 when he was appointed academic pro-vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>As his unit on <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> shows Kettle had interests outside literature, especially in music and film. Opera and vocal music were his great loves, with Mozart and Schubert <i>Lieder</i> taking pride of place.<br>
<br>At some point in 1980 Kettle contracted Parkinson's disease, and he was forced to retire from the Open University in 1981. He finished working on his last publication, the Open University study unit on <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> published in 1983, but he was already very ill and after many months of gradual decline he died in Milton Keynes on Christmas eve 1986. He was cremated there and his ashes were scattered in the Thames.<br>
