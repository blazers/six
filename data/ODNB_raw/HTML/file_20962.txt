<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Outram, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1803&#150;1863), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20959/', "Benjamin Outram (bap. 1764, d. 1805)")</script>, civil engineer and ironmaster, of Butterley Hall, Derbyshire, and his wife, Margaret (1778&#150;1863), daughter of Dr James Anderson of Mounie, Aberdeenshire, was born at Butterley Hall on 29 January 1803. Mrs Outram, who by the sudden death of her husband was left in very straitened circumstances, was a woman of great self-reliance and independence. With her young family she resided for three years at Worksop, then for two years at Barnby Moor, and in 1810 moved to Aberdeen.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>From 1814 Outram was educated in Aberdeen first at Udny School, then at Mr Esson's school, and finally (in 1818) at Marischal College. In 1819 he received a direct Indian cadetship, sailed for India in May, and arrived in Bombay on 15 August. He was temporarily posted to the 4th native infantry, with rank as ensign from 2 May 1819, and then was gazetted a lieutenant in the 1st grenadier native infantry, but was shortly afterwards transferred to the 12th regiment and became acting-adjutant in July 1820.<br>
<br>In November 1822 Outram arranged with his brother, Francis, a second lieutenant in the Bombay Engineers, that they should put by out of their pay as subalterns an allowance for their mother. At Rajkot, where his regiment was quartered, he became an enthusiastic sportsman; and his shikar-book for the seasons of 1822&#150;3 and 1823&#150;4 shows a record of seventy-four wild boars, four nilgai, two hyenas, and two wolves. In April 1824 he moved with his regiment to Malegaon in Khandesh.<h2>
<a name="Indiawarandadministration18241856"></a>India: war and administration, 1824&#150;1856</h2>For the next fourteen years Outram was engaged in a little-known, but vital, aspect of the establishment of British rule in western India: the subjugation of petty chieftains and tribal peoples in the region known as Khandesh and in the interior of Gujarat. The official reports speak of &#145;tribal rebellions&#146;, &#145;outrages&#146; against the British, the lawlessness of marauding bands of tribal peoples, and the refusal of some of the chiefs to accept the new British order. While the contests were unequal, pitting poorly armed and undisciplined groups against the armies of the East India Company, the petty chiefs and the tribal leaders fought tenaciously.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1824 Outram took part in an expedition against Kittur, a princely state which had lapsed to the British on the death without heirs of the ruler, but had resisted the British government and repulsed a small force sent to take possession. Outram's brother, Francis, served in the same expedition. Kittur was besieged, and surrendered on 5 December 1824. In March 1825 Outram was sent to seize the hill fort of Malair between Surat and Malegaon, when an insurrection broke out in the western districts of Khandesh. The garrison fled, the leader and many of his adherents were cut down, and the rest escaped to the hills completely disorganized. In recognition of his services and merit he was placed, on 22 April 1825, under the collector and political agent in Khandesh.<br>
<br>The province of Khandesh became British territory in 1818, after the defeat of the Marathas. At that time the Bhils, a people driven out of Mewar and Jodhpur and subsisting mainly on plunder, formed an eighth part of the whole population of the area. The Bhil agency was established in 1825 under the collector of Khandesh, with three agents: one in the north-west, one in the south, and Outram in the north-east. To the last was entrusted the duty of raising a Bhil light infantry corps, under native commissioned and non-commissioned officers of line regiments. He proceeded to Jatgaon, and led the detachment of his own regiment stationed there to dislodge some Bhils from the mountain fastnesses. Supported by reinforcements from Malegaon, the operation ended in the occupation of the Bhil lands. Outram commenced the formation of his corps by enlisting his captives who brought in their relatives. He also succeeded in gaining the confidence of the chief men by living unguarded among them, and persuaded five to join his corps. By July 1826 300 Bhils who were enrolled in his corps had become efficient soldiers. By 1828 the corps numbered 600 men. In 1829 Francis Outram killed himself in a fit of depression.<br>
<br>In 1830 the Bombay government decided to invade and subdue the Dang country, a tract of tangled forest on the west of Khandesh inhabited by marauding Bhils. Outram, after a fortnight's campaign, overran the country and subdued it, returning with the principal chiefs as his prisoners. In 1831 Outram was sent to investigate uprisings in the districts of Y&agrave;wal and Sauda, and to apprehend the offenders. He captured 469 suspected persons and, after inquiry, 158 were committed for trial. In 1833, the Bhils of the Barwani territory in the Satpura Mountains north of Khandesh having risen in rebellion, Outram, who had been promoted captain on 7 October 1832, took the field against them and struck a decisive blow, capturing the rebel chief Hatnia. During his residence in Khandesh Outram was always able to indulge his passion for hunting, and during the ten years from 1825 to 1834 he killed 191 tigers, 25 bears, 12 buffaloes, and 15 leopards.<br>
<br>Early in 1835 Outram accompanied the British resident at Indore through Malwa and Nimar; then the government sent him to survey the neighbouring province of Gujarat, where, in the Mahi Kantha district, opposition to British rule had developed. Outram's report expressed his conviction that Mahi Kantha would not be peaceful until the unruly clans which occupied it had been subdued and the chiefs punished for opposition to British arms. Outram went on leave to Bombay in December, to be married to his cousin, Margaret Clementina (<i>d</i>. 12 July 1911), daughter of James Anderson of Bridgend, Brechin, Forfarshire. A fortnight after his wedding he returned to Mahi Kantha as political agent, with the general direction of affairs civil and military. Outram succeeded in Mahi Kantha but with the use of such violence that the governor of Bombay, Sir Robert Grant, and the court of directors reproved him, but complimented his military genius, energy, and sound judgement.<br>
<br>Outram's wife was invalided home, and in October 1838, when a British force was ordered to assemble for service in Afghanistan, Outram at once volunteered, and was appointed extra aide-de-camp to Sir John Keane. He was dispatched on a special mission to Cutch, to arrange for land and water transport for the expedition. Outram was associated with Lieutenant Eastwick (afterwards a director of the East India Company), the assistant resident, in a mission to the court of Hyderabad, to conclude a detailed treaty with the amir. The envoys, however, met with such unmistakable signs of hostility that they were compelled to return without effecting their object. Outram was sent on missions to Shah Shuja, the claimant to the Afghan throne, and General MacNaghten in February and March 1839. He took part at Kandahar in the installation of Shah Shuja. He left that city with the advanced column on 27 June, to attack Ghazni, which fell on 23 July. Outram was appointed to command an expedition for the capture of Dost Muhammad Khan, the deposed ruler who had fled towards Bamian and escaped beyond the Oxus.<br>
<br>On 21 August Outram was placed under the British envoy at Kabul, MacNaghten, to conduct an expedition into disturbed districts lying between Kabul and Kandahar. The object of the expedition was to defeat the Ghilzai people, to arrest four chiefs, to punish the inhabitants of the village of Maruf, who had destroyed a caravan <i>en route</i> for India, and to reduce the fort of Haji Khan. He attacked and demolished Haji Khan, and finally arrived at Quetta on 31 October, having accomplished his mission.<br>
<br>Outram accompanied General Willshire as aide-de-camp in November to the siege of Kalat. He was deputed to take a copy of the general's dispatch to the governor of Bombay by the direct route to Sonmiani Bundar, to find out whether the route would be practical for troops. Disguised as an Afghan, he started on this perilous journey through an enemy's country, accompanied by a private servant and two Saiyids of Shal as guides. After many adventures and hairbreadth escapes he reached Sonmiani on 23 November, having subsisted during the whole journey on dates and water. From Sonmiani he went by water to Karachi and Bombay. For his services at Kalat, Outram was promoted brevet major on 13 November 1839, while Shah Shuja bestowed on him the second-class order of the Durrani empire.<br>
<br>At the end of 1839 Lord Auckland appointed Outram political agent in Lower Sind, in succession to Colonel Pottinger. He arrived at Hyderabad on 24 February. The main features of his work in 1840 were the reduction of taxes on inland produce brought to the British camp at Karachi, the relief of the Indus traffic from excessive tolls, and the negotiations with Mir Sher Muhammad of Mirpur, whereby quasi-amicable relations were established. In 1841 he negotiated a satisfactory treaty with Mir Sher Muhammad. Soon afterwards Mir Nur Muhammad, the amir of Hyderabad, summoned Outram to his deathbed, and confided his brother, Mir Nasir Khan, and his youngest son, Mir Husain Ali, to Outram's protection. Outram regarded this as a sacred charge and the boy as an adopted son.<br>
<br>On 18 August 1841 Outram left Hyderabad for Quetta, having been appointed political agent in Upper Sind in addition to his charge of Lower Sind. He arrived at Quetta on 2 September, and the young Nasir, khan of Kalat, met him in durbar. On 6 October the khan was installed by Outram at Kalat, after signing the ratification to a treaty with the Indian government. At the end of November Outram heard that the British army, which had occupied Kabul, was under siege, and his energies were taxed to the utmost to support the failing prestige of the government.<br>
<br>In February 1842 Lord Ellenborough succeeded Lord Auckland as governor-general. Outram did his best to impress on the new governor-general the inadvisability of retiring from Afghanistan without first reasserting British power at Kabul. On 28 March 1842 General England was defeated at Haikalzai, in the Pishin valley. The general officially laid the blame upon Outram's assistant, Lieutenant Hammersley, for want of proper acquaintance with the disposition and movements of the enemy. Outram could not acquiesce in the censure, and his bold advocacy of Hammersley's cause brought him under the displeasure of Lord Ellenborough, who invested General William Nott with the chief political as well as military control in Kandahar and Sind, thus subordinating Outram to him as a political officer.<br>
<br>On 1 June Outram left Sukkur for Quetta, to assist General Nott in his preparations for an advance on Kabul. In October he accompanied General England in the withdrawal of his force to India through the dangerous part of the Bolan Pass. He then pushed on alone to Sukkur to report to Sir Charles James Napier, who in August had taken over the command of the troops in Sind and Baluchistan, with entire control over the political agents and civil officers. Outram was remanded to his regiment, and the political establishment dissolved. At a public dinner given to Outram at Sukkur, on 5 November 1842, Napier proposed his health in the following terms: &#145;Gentlemen, I give you the &#147;Bayard of India&#148;, sans peur et sans reproche, Major James Outram of the Bombay army&#146;, and the epithet has since become permanently linked with his name.<br>
<br>Outram applied for furlough for two years, and was to have sailed on 2 January 1843, when, on the application of Napier, he was appointed a commissioner for the arrangement of the details of a revised treaty with the amirs of Sind. He arrived at Sukkur on 3 January. This was the beginning of an association between the two men that ended in extraordinary bitterness, carried on through memoranda, books, and speeches. While part of the rancour on Outram's part may have been due to the loss of his independent position in Sind, and being brought under Napier's control, there were fundamental policy differences between them over the place of the Indian rulers, such as the amirs, in the new order. Napier believed the amirs were relics of oppressive feudalism that should be abolished, whereas Outram believed that before the British entered Sind, the people there were as happy as those under any government in Asia. When the governor-general ordered an even more rigorous treaty to be signed by the amirs, Outram became convinced that Napier would use it to goad the amirs into war, which would give him the opportunity to annex the whole of Sind. Knowing how the amirs' undisciplined, ill-armed tribesmen would be slaughtered by Napier's army, Outram wrote to him protesting that his policies were harsh and tyrannical, and that every life lost in consequence would be murder. Outram was no longer the Bayard of India; in correspondence Napier referred to him as &#145;son of a bitch&#146;.<br>
<br>Outram accompanied Napier in his march across the desert to Imamgarh to destroy the amirs' great fort. After the fort was demolished Outram went to Khairpur to meet the chiefs of Upper Sind and the vakils of the amirs of Lower Sind, and on 8 February he arrived at Hyderabad. What happened at Hyderabad at this time was central to the dispute between Outram and Napier. Outram had asked for one more chance to negotiate the new treaty before attacking them, and Napier had agreed. According to Napier's version, while Outram was at the residency, he and his force of 100 men were attacked by 8000 men under Mir Shahdad Khan, one of the leading amirs, and after gallantly defending the residency, they escaped by boat up the River Indus under heavy fire. Napier then began the war in earnest against the amirs. Outram's version of events is very different. He said that the amirs had signed the treaty, and that he had written this to the governor-general, but that Napier had not sent the letter, not wanting to miss the excuse for attacking the amirs. While Outram's account seems plausible, Napier's was more heroic, and it became the accepted version.<br>
<br>On 16 February Outram joined Napier at Matiari, 16 miles above Hyderabad. Napier at once sent Outram off at his own request to burn the Miani and neighbouring forests (<i>shik&aacute;rg&aacute;hs</i>), in which it was expected the enemy would collect, and from which it would be difficult to dislodge them. He was employed on this duty while Napier was fighting the battle of Miani, where, as Outram had predicted, Napier's well-trained troops slaughtered 6000 of the amirs' followers. On 18 February the amirs of Hyderabad, Mirs Hasan Khan, Shahdad, and Husain Ali Khan, surrendered. The two former were detained as prisoners, but the latter was released at Outram's request out of respect for the memory of his late father, Mir Nur Muhammad.<br>
<br>Outram's functions as commissioner having ceased on the outbreak of hostilities, he left on 20 February for Bombay, carrying dispatches. In April he was presented at Bombay with a sword of honour of the value of 300 guineas and a costly piece of plate. For his services in the Sind War he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 4 July 1843, and made a CB. Outram's share of the prize money amounted to &pound;3000, but he declined to take the money for himself, and distributed it among charitable institutions in India.<br>
<br>Outram returned to England in May 1843 with his mind filled with the unfortunate condition of the amirs and people of Sind, and during his furlough was engaged in making representations on their behalf. He was also engaged in the great controversy on the annexation of Sind, and the difference of opinion between Napier and himself led to a serious rupture. The contest proved a long and costly one for Outram. For years the uncongenial paper warfare dragged on, and was the source of misrepresentations, misunderstandings, and aspersions on both sides.<br>
<br>News of upheaval at Lahore and the murder of the Maharaja Sher Singh was received in London in November, and Outram returned to India in December, armed with a letter from Wellington to the commander-in-chief in India. When Outram arrived at Sir Hugh Gough's camp at Fatehpur, Lord Ellenborough, who was there, refused, as a supporter of Napier, to grant him a personal interview, and objected to his joining Gough, but gave him the minor political charge of Minar in central India. There was not sufficient work to occupy him in Minar; he was worried with the Sind controversy, and in September he resigned his appointment, intending to return home. An outbreak, however, in the southern Maratha country between Bombay and Goa led Outram to offer his services. He was sent on special duty and on 13 October 1844 he was present at the capture of Samangarh. The rebellion spreading, he was attached to Major-General Delamotte's staff as head of the intelligence department. During the campaign he distinguished himself at the storming and capture of the forts of Pawangarh and Panala. Outram returned to Bombay in December, and was at once ordered to take part in the suppression of disturbances in Savantvadi, south of the country he had just left.<br>
<br>In May 1845 Outram was appointed resident at Satara, and he took up his appointment on 26 May; in May 1847 he was transferred to the British residency at Baroda, the highest position under the Bombay government. On 21 February 1848 he became a regimental major. Ill health compelled him in November to go for a change of air to Egypt and Syria, and he occupied himself there by writing an exhaustive memoir on Egypt for the East India Company, for which he received the thanks of government. Outram returned to his post at Baroda in May 1850. Here he set himself to work to put down <i>khatpat</i> or corruption. He sent in charges against Narsu Pant, head native agent at the residency, and in a full report, dated 31 October 1851, for submission to the court of directors, he dealt with the <i>khatpat</i> case without respect of persons. His report was considered by the Bombay government to be disrespectful both to itself and to the ruler of Baroda. The result was that Outram was removed from the office of resident at Baroda. He returned to England in March 1852. While the court of directors upheld the Bombay government, it expressed a hope that on Outram's return to India a suitable opportunity would be found of employing him.<br>
<br>In July 1853, having been promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel in the preceding month, Outram returned to India, arriving at Calcutta on 12 September. While at Calcutta, at the request of the governor-general, he wrote &#145;Memorandum on the invasion of India from the westward&#146;, which argued that the Indus River should be the western frontier of British India. The court of directors had written to the governor-general to find employment for Outram under the supreme government, and the transfer, towards the end of the year, of Baroda from the Bombay government to the government of India enabled Lord Dalhousie to reinstate Outram as resident there. Outram arrived at Baroda on 19 March 1854, and, after holding the office for a month, was appointed political agent and commanded at Aden. He embarked at Bombay in June, but the change to Aden in the hot season affected his health. In November Lord Dalhousie appointed him to the residency of Oudh, and he made his official entry into Lucknow on 5 December.<br>
<br>Outram was instructed to prepare at once a report on the condition of the country, and to state whether the improvement demanded by Lord Hardinge seven years previously had in any degree been effected. In March 1855 he submitted his report, which represented the condition of Oudh as deplorable, and reluctantly recommended annexation as the only remedy. Annexation took place in February 1856, but with harsher terms for the ruler than Outram had recommended. Outram was promoted major-general on 28 November 1854, and was made KCB in February 1856. Ill health compelled him to return home in May.<h2>
<a name="TheAngloPersianWar1857"></a>The Anglo-Persian War, 1857</h2>On 13 November Outram was summoned to India House and informed that he had been appointed to the command of the army for the Anglo-Persian War. Outram was given the local rank of lieutenant-general, and invested with diplomatic powers. He left England at once, and landed at Bombay on 22 December 1856. He left Bombay on 15 January 1857, and arrived at Bushehr on 27 January. The Persian commander-in-chief was at Borazjan, and was collecting a large force there. Outram determined to attack this position and, after a march of 46 miles in forty-one hours, in cold, wet, and stormy weather, the camp was reached, and found to have been hastily abandoned on Outram's approach. Outram commenced his return march on the night of 7 February to Bushehr, carrying with him large stores of provision. On the march, at daybreak on 8 February, they were attacked at Khushab by some 6000 Persians, with a few guns. After a smart action, in which 700 Persians were killed and two guns captured, the Persian force fled.<br>
<br>It was not until 26 March that operations were commenced against the Persian stronghold, Muhammarah. The Persians abandoned their position and fled, leaving sixteen guns and all their baggage stores and ammunition behind them. Peace had already been concluded at Baghdad, and the war was at an end. Outram was sent to Baghdad in May to arrange the formation of a mission to see that the evacuation of Herat fortress and district was duly carried out by the Persians. He returned to Bombay on 26 June 1857. For his services Outram was made GCB.<h2>
<a name="TheIndianmutiny18571858"></a>The Indian mutiny, 1857&#150;1858</h2>Meanwhile the Indian mutiny had broken out, and Outram's son, who was stationed at Aligarh, and his wife had a narrow escape. Outram reached Calcutta on 31 July, and on 8 August was given command of two divisions of the Bengal army occupying the country from Calcutta to Cawnpore inclusive, while he was also made chief commissioner of Oudh in succession to Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence, killed in the defence of Lucknow. He took with him Robert Napier as his military secretary and chief of staff, and arrived at Dinapore on 19 August. On 1 September he was at Allahabad, and on 15 September he reached Cawnpore.<br>
<br>Outram had already telegraphed from Benares to Havelock that he would shortly join him at Cawnpore with reinforcements, but that he would leave to Havelock the glory of the relief of Lucknow, accompanying him only in his civil capacity as commissioner, and placing his military services at Havelock's disposal as a volunteer. On 28 September Sir Colin Campbell confirmed Outram's temporary transfer of command by a general order, in which he called attention to the disinterested sacrifice made by Outram in favour of Havelock. On 19 September 1857 the force crossed the river and marched out of Cawnpore. On 23 September, in the action of the Alambagh, Outram, at the head of the volunteer and native cavalry, pursued the flying enemy to the Charbagh Bridge. On 25 September Havelock's force, after severe fighting, in which Outram received a flesh wound in the arm, won their way to the residency.<br>
<br>Outram resumed his military command by a general order on 26 September. He found that he had simply reinforced a beleaguered garrison, and was himself effectually besieged until November, when Sir Colin Campbell, the commander-in-chief, came to the rescue. On 12 November Outram, on his side, blew in the outer wall of the garden of the palace of Farid Bakhsh, and opened his batteries on the insurgent defences in front. The buildings were soon in his possession; but he was still half a mile from the most advanced post of Sir Colin Campbell's force, and the way was under the enemy's fire. Outram, however, determined to meet Sir Colin Campbell without delay and, with Havelock and seven others, set out. Four were struck down, but Outram, Havelock, and their surviving companions reached the Moti Mahal unhurt. After a short conference they made their way back. Sir Colin entrusted the withdrawal of the garrison and the evacuation of the residency to Outram.<br>
<br>After the evacuation of the residency Campbell left Outram with a field force at the Alambagh position to hold the city of Lucknow until Campbell had placed his convoy in safety and disposed of the Gwalior mutineers. For three months Outram's division, consisting of about 5000 men and 25 guns, kept in check 120,000 organized troops with more than 130 guns. The leader of the rebels at Lucknow was the famous Maulvi known as Ahmad Shah. He made determined efforts to sever Outram's communications, and continually harassed his outposts. From the end of December 1857 and through January and February 1858 sharp engagements were fought, in which Outram's troops were successful. The last and most desperate attack was made by the rebels on 25 February, and it was not until dawn the next day that they were completely routed and fell back on Lucknow.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1858 Campbell returned to take Lucknow. Outram was placed in command of a large force of picked troops on the north side of the Gumti River, and, crossing the river on 6 March, he pitched his camp near the Fyzabad Road. On 9 March he made his attack, seizing the Chakar Kothi, or yellow house, the key of the enemy's position in that quarter, and, driving the rebels to the river, threw up batteries on its bank to keep down the enemy's fire. The <i>kaisarbagh</i> fell to Sir Colin Campbell on the morning of 14 March. On 16 March Outram, having recrossed the Gumti, advanced through the Chattar Manzil and carried the residency. On the morning of 19 March Outram attacked the Musabagh, held by 5000 men and thirteen guns, and carried it, capturing twelve guns. So ended the capture of Lucknow.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears18581860"></a>Last years, 1858&#150;1860</h2>Outram was appointed military member of the governor-general's council, and, handing over the charge of Oudh to Robert Montgomery, left Lucknow on 4 April and joined Lord Canning at Allahabad. Many important matters, such as the reorganization of the Indian army, were under consideration during Outram's tenure of office, and he left many wise and carefully prepared minutes recording his views. A baronetcy was conferred upon him by the queen, and the House of Commons voted him an annuity of &pound;1000, to be continued to his immediate successor. On 16 July Outram was promoted lieutenant-general. In October the City of London conferred upon him its freedom and presented him with a sword of honour.<br>
<br>In July 1860 Outram's health gave way. He resigned his seat in the council of the viceroy, and, after a public entertainment at Calcutta, left India for good. An equestrian statue of him by J. H. Foley RA was erected on the Maidan in Calcutta by public subscription. On the institution of the Order of the Star of India in 1861 Outram was one of the first to be made a knight companion. In June 1862 he received an honorary DCL from Oxford University. In July a deputation headed by the duke of Argyll presented him with silver plate at his house, 10 Queen's Gate Gardens, South Kensington. He died at Pau in the south of France on 11 March 1863, his only child, Francis Boyd Outram (1836&#150;1912), inheriting the title. His wife survived him. He was given a public funeral and was buried on 25 March in Westminster Abbey. The grave is near the centre of the nave, marked by a marble slab bearing the words &#145;The Bayard of India&#146;. A statue by Noble was erected on the Thames Embankment.<br>
<br>Contemporary accounts suggest that Outram was kind-hearted and modest, but very stubborn and unwilling to change his mind once it was made up. Like his great opponent, Sir Charles Napier, he enjoyed fighting and the command of men, but, unlike him, was deeply attached to the traditional Indian leaders. He quickly saw and rewarded merit in young officers, and he seemed to have a genuine concern for the welfare of his soldiers. He spent much on books for regimental libraries in India, and he established at Dum-Dum a soldiers' club known as the Outram Institute.<br>
<br>Outram's publications included, in addition to his reports and minutes officially printed: <span class="italic">Rough Notes of the Campaign in Sinde and Afghanistan in 1838&#150;9</span> (privately printed, 1840); <span class="italic">The Conquest of Scinde: a Commentary</span> (1846); and <span class="italic">Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram's Persian Campaign in 1857</span> (privately printed, 1860).<br>
