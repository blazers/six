<span class="headword">Weston <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Edmunds, Hunt]</span>,  William</span>  (1549/50&#150;1615), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Maidstone, Kent. Nothing is known of his family.<h2>
<a name="Educationandnoviciate"></a>Education and noviciate</h2>According to most sources, he was educated at Oxford, though there is no clear evidence for this in the university registers. He has been assumed to be the William Weston who was admitted to Christ Church in 1564 and obtained his BA on 17 February 1569. He may have been at Lincoln's Inn in 1570. He was already a Catholic when he moved to Paris in 1571 to continue his studies. At Paris he was invited to come to the newly founded English College at Douai. He went there in 1572 and received minor orders, together with other seminarists, at Brussels the next year. At Douai he crossed the path of Edmund Campion, who then left for Rome to become a Jesuit. In the summer of 1575 Weston made his pilgrimage on foot to Rome, and on 5 November, aged twenty-five, he entered the Jesuit noviciate at Sant' Andrea; Robert Persons and Henry Garnet had also joined that year. The next eight years Weston spent in Spain. He completed his noviciate in Montilla and studied philosophy and theology at C&oacute;rdoba for three years. After having been ordained priest in 1579, he worked in San Lucar and Cadiz and taught Greek at the English College at Seville from 1582 to 1584.<h2>
<a name="Englishmission"></a>English mission</h2>The first Jesuits, Campion and Persons, arrived in England in 1580 and began their efforts to organize the mission. In 1581, after the publication of <span class="italic">Decem rationes</span>, Campion was executed at Tyburn and Persons had to flee the country. Despite these early set-backs and the intensified persecution of Catholics in the 1580s, English priests continued to be sent to their home country from the seminaries. In 1583 Weston received a summons to go to Paris from his general, Claudio Acquaviva, but he could leave Seville only after the winter. In Paris in 1584 he learned from Persons that he was to be sent to England as a missionary (on Persons's recommendation). Weston was apprehensive when on 12 June he wrote to Acquaviva accepting his mission, fearing the cruelties of torture and execution. He assumed the alias of Edmunds out of respect for Campion.<br>
<br>After spending about three months with Persons in Paris, Weston left the city on 26 August 1584. On 10 September he landed on the Norfolk coast, accompanied by Ralph Emerson, the Jesuit lay brother who had been Campion's companion. However, within two weeks Emerson was arrested for bringing over Catholic books and committed to the Poultry prison. He was to languish in English prisons for twenty years. Weston's first deeds in England were the conversion to Roman Catholicism of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, and a brave visit to the Tower to see the Jesuit priest Jasper Heywood, together with Heywood's sister Elizabeth and her son, the subsequently famous poet John Donne: &#145;So I accompanied her to the Tower, but with a feeling of great trepidation as I saw the vast battlements, and was led by the warder past the gates with their iron fastenings, which were closed behind me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 10&#150;11). Heywood was exiled in 1585 and Weston succeeded him as superior of the Jesuits in England, facing the difficult task of organizing the mission. For some time no other Jesuit was at liberty in England.<br>
<br>In 1585 the act against all priests was passed, making it treason for any priest to be in England and felony punishable by death for anyone who helped or harboured missionaries. Weston later commented:<blockquote>As far as I was concerned, I thought it would be well to retire myself to some place where I could judge from my own observation the way things were likely to go. I would be able then to see how Catholics thought and felt: whether they would retain their old loyalty to the faith, search out priests, ask them to their houses and maintain them; or whether they would keep them at a distance and agree to be abandoned by them in a time of such peril. Far better, I thought, that they should invite or summon me to them, than that I should thrust myself on them and have them risk their lives and property for my sake. (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 22&#150;3)</blockquote>In April he attended a conference of Catholic gentry and seminary priests at Hoxton, near London. It was decided that priests were to stay at inns, and a fund to support them was established by the gentry.<h2>
<a name="Exorcisms"></a>Exorcisms</h2>During the years 1585&#150;6 Weston and a group of secular priests were involved in the practice of exorcism. Though it was not popular among the priests of the Counter-Reformation, an interest in demonology was not unusual, and the priests concerned may have been influenced by public exorcisms practised in France. Weston was convinced of the power of God to cure demoniacs through the Catholic church and the priest&#150;exorcist. He felt people wanted such public exorcisms and, as a proselytizer, thought it possible thus to confirm waverers in their faith. The exorcisms have been presented as a conversion campaign, based on the unreliable confessions of Anthony Tyrrell, a priest&#150;exorcist turned informer, who spoke of a total of at least 500 conversions. Weston's exorcisms, however, all took place in recusants' private houses, mostly that of Sir George Peckham of Denham, Buckinghamshire, and were on a considerably smaller scale.<br>
<br>At this time rumours were spread of a connection between the Denham exorcisms conducted by Weston, John Cornelius, Robert Dibdale, and possibly John Ballard, and the Babington plot, an intricate affair involving Walsingham's machinations against Mary, queen of Scots. Ballard (former companion of Tyrrell) was a main conspirator of a group plotting the assassination of Queen Elizabeth, a Spanish invasion, and the installation of Mary as queen of Britain. The affluent gentleman Anthony Babington and his romantic associates hoped to free their beloved queen from prison, at first without any idea of regicide. Babington possibly visited the Denham exorcisms, and his servant Nicholas Marwood was Weston's first demoniac. The government allowed the exorcisms to continue in the hope of implicating a wider circle of Catholics while waiting for the best moment to explode the manipulated plot and damage the reputation and the organization of English Catholicism. In June 1586 the house at Denham was raided and the prisons were prepared for the Babington arrests.<br>
<br>After the Hoxton conference Weston had help from two new arrivals. The Jesuits Henry Garnet and Robert Southwell landed in England on 7 July 1586 and Weston met them in London on 13 July. On the same day or the next morning Babington sought Weston's advice on the difficult situation in which he had landed himself. Weston understood he needed to dissociate himself from the foolhardy Babington and took the newly arrived Jesuits to Harlesford, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the home of his friend Richard Bold. Here a conference crucial to the development and organization of the English mission took place from 14 to 23 July. From his first days in England Weston had worked to maintain and build on the network of Catholic gentry contacts, and he compiled a list of private hiding-places for the incoming priests. His work, together with the new instructions from Rome, formed the basis of the continued missionary effort. He spent happy days at Harlesford, where there was time for friendship, prayer and mass in the chapel, and musical performances by members of Bold's household. The composer William Byrd was also among the company.<h2>
<a name="Imprisonment"></a>Imprisonment</h2>Soon after the Harlesford meeting, on 3 August 1586, Weston was arrested outside Bishopsgate and imprisoned in a private house near the Clink prison. He had been recognized by Walsingham's spy Nicholas Berden, but his arrest had not been planned. In fact this was the beginning of the round-up of the Babington plot. Ballard was arrested the next day and Weston was locked up in order to avoid alarming Babington, who was arrested on 14 August. Though Walsingham had spread rumours of Weston's complicity, at a later stage he appears to have instructed his agents not to associate influential priests with the plot. Yet the government perhaps hoped that Weston would become involved. After the trials and executions of the conspirators in September Weston was transferred to the Clink prison. His friends the priests John Lowe, John Adams, and Robert Dibdale were executed at Tyburn on 8 October. Weston was left to wonder why his trial was delayed, reflecting every day on his possibly imminent death. Shortly before the execution of Mary, queen of Scots, on 8 February 1587 Weston was interviewed by a clerk of the privy council, mostly about the exorcisms, but he was never brought to trial.<br>
<br>In January 1588 Weston was moved to Wisbech Castle, the prison for notable Catholics in Cambridgeshire, where he was kept in isolation for the first four years. After this period conditions in the prison improved, and the priests could move about and receive visitors. Weston played a considerable part in organizing the priests' common life under the difficult circumstances in prison. Initially, a group of some eighteen secular priests set up rules for the confraternity and wished Weston, the only Jesuit, to be their leader. Garnet, who had succeeded Weston as superior in England, allowed Weston moral leadership but no authority over the priests. Tensions developed between Weston's group and another led by the secular priest Christopher Bagshaw. The situation deteriorated after the death of Cardinal Allen in 1594. A long series of disputes and attempts at reconciliation ensued, but the prison community remained divided. The Wisbech stirs, as these quarrels became known, had at their core an anti-Jesuit impetus which centred on the Jesuit Weston's alleged ambition to domineer over the seculars. They were no isolated event. During the 1580s Jesuit&#150;secular friction had occurred in the English College at Rome and in Flanders. The idea took hold that the Jesuits, who were in charge of most of the seminaries, wanted absolute control over the English mission. Following the appointment of the first arch-priest George Blackwell (with jurisdiction over the secular clergy) next to the Jesuit superior Garnet in 1598 issues of the English mission, such as toleration of Catholics, political allegiance, and Jesuit presence in England, were debated in the bitter confrontations of the arch-priest controversy. The Wisbech stirs were a prelude to this serious disruption in English Catholic relations.<br>
<br>In December 1598 Weston was taken to the Tower and locked in solitary confinement for five years. He suffered from insomnia, headaches, increasing blindness, loneliness, and quite possibly also mental illness. The reason for this move was not given, but the guards accompanying Weston to the Tower told him:<blockquote>that I had meddled in Spanish politics and favoured the Spanish party &hellip; They felt certain that unless I was put out of the way and had my mouth stopped, they would never be able to come to a decision on the matters which they had set in motion. Let that suffice for the affairs of Wisbech. (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 192&#150;4)</blockquote>In July 1598, before Weston's transfer, a manuscript compilation known as Weston's &#145;Book of miracles&#146; was discovered. This work came into the hands of the bishop of London, Richard Bancroft, who, with his chaplain Samuel Harsnett, was involved in a campaign against the puritan exorcist John Darrell. Darrell was condemned as a fraud in 1599. As the appellants sought negotiations with the government, Bancroft and the privy council, aiming to divide the Catholics, collected their papers and supported the publications of the appellant polemicists, among them Bagshaw's <span class="italic">True Relation of the Faction Begun at Wisbich</span> (1601), which incriminated Weston and the Jesuits. In 1602 Bancroft and Harsnett became interested in exposing the exorcisms at Denham as related in the &#145;Book of miracles&#146;, and an inquiry was started sixteen years after they had taken place. Thus Harsnett's satirical <span class="italic">Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures</span> (1603), while forming part of a series of attacks on Darrell's practices, cleared the bishop of the charge that he was concerned only with suppressing puritans and revealed not just its anti-Jesuitism, but also Bancroft's interest in manipulating the arch-priest controversy. Harsnett's work, as well as tracts of the arch-priest controversy, were used by Shakespeare, especially in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, written in 1604&#150;5, bringing the Denham devils Fliberdigibbet and Frateretto, among others, universal fame.<h2>
<a name="Exileanddeath"></a>Exile and death</h2>After the accession of James I in 1603 Weston was given a choice between taking the oath of allegiance and exile on the continent. He chose exile and was released from the Tower on 13 May. He probably never saw Harsnett's <span class="italic">Declaration</span> published that summer. Weston recovered his health somewhat at St Omer. He went to Rome in 1604 and worked for a few months at the English College of St Alban's at Valladolid as spiritual prefect. In 1605, a year before his friend Henry Garnet's execution after the Gunpowder Plot, Weston left for Seville, where he worked as spiritual director of the English College and resumed lecturing on theology, Hebrew, and Greek. Here he met Francisco de Peralta, the college superior and an old friend from his years in C&oacute;rdoba, who was to write his biography. In 1611 Weston started his autobiography at the request of his general and related his experiences as a missionary in England. Written with restraint and containing interesting observations, it is a valuable firsthand account of Tudor England. The only complete copy was translated into English by Philip Caraman.<br>
<br>Weston stayed at Seville until 1614, when he was made rector of the English College of St Alban's at Valladolid. Here he died after a brief illness between 14 and 19 April 1615. His reputation suffered considerably and unjustly from the appellant publications which long influenced writers on the Catholic controversies from Charles Dodd to T. G. Law. Testimony of friends, the autobiography, and the few extant letters by Weston naturally create a different, at times also too saintly, impression of the man. Modern commentators (though not always in agreement) have offered a fairer estimate of his character and activities.<br>
