<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowerbank,  James Scott</span>  (1797&#150;1877), <span class="occ">geologist and zoologist</span>, was born on 14 July 1797 in Sun Street, Bishopsgate, London, the fourth of six children of Edward Bowerbank, distiller, and his wife, Fanny. He went to Dr Kelly's school in Finsbury Square, and is said to have developed a love of nature from studying the plants growing alongside the River Lea. He started work in his father's distillery, Bowerbank &amp; Co., at the age of fifteen, and he and his brother Edward became joint heads of the family firm on the death of their father. Bowerbank gained a reputation in the City for being a careful and attentive man of business. He remained associated with the firm until 1847.<br>
<br>In spite of the demands of the family firm, Bowerbank always found time for scientific research. He joined the Spitalfields Mathematical Society in 1818 and soon became one of its most active members, giving lectures on botany in the winters of 1822&#150;4, and on human osteology in 1831. His earliest independent scientific researches were made with a microscope and related to the fine structure of the insect wing. He enjoyed microscopical work throughout his life, and owned many fine instruments. He was one of the founders of the Microscopical Society of London in 1839, and was its president in 1846&#150;7.<br>
<br>Bowerbank lived in Hoxton as a young man and started collecting fossils from the London Clay, particularly the fossil seeds and fruit to be found on the Isle of Sheppey. He joined the Geological Society in 1832, and in 1836, with several geological friends, he founded the London Clay Club, whose members used to meet regularly to display and discuss the fruits of their collecting. In 1840 he published the first, and only, part of a projected monograph on the <span class="italic">Fossil Fruits of the London Clay</span>, which remained a standard work for many years. This same year Bowerbank moved to Islington where he married Caroline; the couple had no children as far as is known. In 1846 they moved to 3 Highbury Grove, a spacious house with room for Bowerbank's growing geological collections. He was an enthusiastic collector in many branches of geology, and his museum eventually amounted to 100,000 specimens.<br>
<br>Bowerbank was a sociable man, and used to hold &#145;open house&#146; on Monday evenings, to which young beginners in geology and microscopy were especially welcome. The idea of the aquarium was developed at his house as he experimented with growing algae, other plants, and fish in a large jar. The secretary of the Zoological Society saw what he was doing and adopted the idea, on a much larger scale, for the London Zoo in 1853. The house became celebrated as a scientific centre in London, and is depicted in a lithographed cartoon, &#145;Highbury Grove in 1846&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1847, after the reading of a paper by Joseph Prestwich at the Geological Society, Bowerbank invited the assembled geologists to meet him in the tea-room. He there proposed the establishment of a society for the publication of undescribed British fossils. This suggestion, which was supported by William Buckland, Henry De la Beche, William Fitton, and others, was the origin of the Palaeontographical Society. Bowerbank served the society first as honorary secretary and later as president. He was also, in 1844, one of the founders of the Ray Society, and was treasurer from 1845 until 1860, when he did not stand for re-election following criticism of the annual accounts. In 1842 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and he was awarded an honorary degree of LLD by the University of St Andrews in 1857.<br>
<br>A visit to Brighton after a storm in 1841 allowed Bowerbank to collect a large number of fresh sponges, and led to a lifelong interest in the group. He studied the fine structure, and the classification and nomenclature of both living and fossil sponges. He became interested in silicification as a geological process, and developed the idea that most, if not all, flints are composed of sponge material. He published papers on sponges in the <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>, the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span>, and the <span class="italic">Microscopical Society Transactions</span>. His <span class="italic">Monograph of the British Spongiadae</span> was published by the Ray Society in four volumes between 1864 and 1882, being edited and completed after his death by the Revd A. M. Norman.<br>
<br>Bowerbank retired from business in 1847. About 1860, concerned for his wife's health, he bought a house in St Leonards, Sussex, and they spent part of each year there. In 1864, apparently after his wife's death, he sold the house in London to move permanently to Sussex. He sold the most important parts of his fossil collection to the British Museum in 1865 and had the remainder auctioned by J. C. Stevens in November of that year, keeping only the sponges. His friends formed a testimonial fund committee which subscribed for a marble bust by Peter Slater, which was presented to the Geological Society in 1865. Bowerbank retained an interest in science throughout the remainder of his life, and continued working on his Ray Society sponge monograph until a few days before his death. He died at his home, 2 East Ascent, St Leonards, Sussex, on 8 March 1877, and was buried in Hollington churchyard. His valuable collection of sponges was acquired by the British Museum in 1877.<br>
