<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Anthony</span>  (1721?&#150;1796), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born at Kendal, Westmorland, the elder son of Arthur Shepherd. Following his schooling at Kendal under Mr Towers, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on 27 June 1740, at the age of nineteen. He received the degree of BA in 1744 and proceeded MA from Christ's College in 1747; he became a BD in 1761, and a DD in 1766. He was ordained in London on 23 February 1746 and held a long succession of livings&#151;vicar of Croxton, Norfolk (1756&#150;8), vicar of Bourn, Cambridgeshire (1758&#150;63), rector of Barton Mills, Suffolk (1763&#150;82), canon of Windsor (1777&#150;96), rector of Eastling, Kent (1782&#150;96), and rector of Hartley Wespall, Hampshire (1792&#150;6)&#151;while remaining throughout at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Shepherd was a fellow of Christ's College from 1747 to 1783 and a tutor from 1752 to 1777. Previous biographers have criticized his laziness, but other indications that he was not greatly esteemed by the fellows of Christ's may explain some of the animosity towards him. Shepherd involved the college in a lawsuit which began in 1765 and dragged on until 1805, linked to his lease of the tithes of Burnham Westgate. When he became canon of Windsor in 1777 the college requested that he resign his fellowship. He declined, and from 1777 to 1781 the college continually sought to have the fellowship declared vacant. Such a declaration was among the first accomplishments of John Barker after his election as master in 1780; Shepherd himself had been a candidate to head the college. Despite some objections, Shepherd's fellowship finally ceased on 22 November 1783.<br>
<br>Shepherd was elected Plumian professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge in 1760 and FRS in 1763. In 1768 he was appointed master of mechanics to George III. He published several versions of <span class="italic">The Heads of a Course of Lectures in Experimental Philosophy Read at Christ's College</span>. As Plumian professor he was a commissioner of the board of longitude, which published <span class="italic">Tables for correcting the apparent distance of the moon and a star from the effects of refraction and parallax</span> (1772), to which he contributed a preface, including a brief history of the problem of determining longitude at sea; the tables themselves were calculated by others. In 1774 Captain Cook named a group of islands after his friend Shepherd.<br>
<br>Shepherd was known to have an interest both in wine and in music. He bequeathed a number of astronomical and musical instruments, some by important makers, but his taste was not above criticism. A member of Christ's who had been involved in the calculation of the astronomical tables, with whom Shepherd may not have been on the best of terms, suggested that &#145;the Doctor did not shine more in music than he did in astronomy; and that he was not qualified to play the second Cremona in a concert&#146;  (Nichols, 6.678). Fanny, the daughter of his musical friend Dr Charles Burney, described Shepherd as &#145;dullness itself&#146;, also noting that he was &#145;prodigiously tall and stout&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Diary</span>, 1.284). His portrait, part of his bequest, is in the possession of the University of Cambridge. Shepherd, who never married, died at his house in Dean Street, Soho, London, on 15 June 1796.<br>
