<span class="headword">Harrison,  Arthur</span>  (1868&#150;1936), <span class="occ">organ builder</span>, was born on 21 February 1868 in College Street, Rochdale, Lancashire, the second of the seven children of Tom Hugh Harrison (1839&#150;1912), organ builder, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDowell (<i>d</i>. 1921). In 1872 the family moved to Durham, and in 1882, after attending Durham School, Harrison followed his father into the craft of organ building, serving as an apprentice and eventually, in 1893, becoming his partner. The firm's business took him to many parts of the British Isles, but Durham remained his base for the rest of his life. On 24 January 1895 he married Elizabeth Jane Henderson (1869&#150;1946), daughter of the Revd James Henderson, rector of Wallsend. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Harrison's first notable instrument, the organ at St Nicholas's, Whitehaven, was completed in 1904 to a design influenced by Lieutenant-Colonel George Dixon, a wealthy amateur who became a close friend. Thanks partly to Dixon's influence, by the outbreak of the First World War Harrison had completed a series of instruments which, through their distinctive tonal qualities, mechanical reliability, and immaculate finish, established the firm of Harrison and Harrison as the foremost organ builder of the day. The organs at Durham and Ely cathedrals (1905, 1908), All Saints, Margaret Street, London (1911), and St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol (1912), were outstanding in the pre-war period. Outstanding in the post-war period was his work at the Caird Hall, Dundee (1923), the Royal Albert Hall, London (1925&#150;33), and King's College, Cambridge (1934). Throughout his career he built small organs of distinction, too, such as those at St John's, Keswick (1912), and All Saints, Maidenhead (1931).<br>
<br>Harrison's conception of the organ had crystallized by the time of the Ely contract, and there was little essential difference between his Edwardian organs and those he built in the 1920s and 1930s. A romantic conception, developed at a time when organists habitually played orchestral transcriptions, it was influenced by the work of Henry Willis and, in points of detail, by the work of continental builders such as Schulze and Cavaill&eacute;-Coll, and progressive builders such as Casson and Hope-Jones. It was, moreover, a conception intense in its particularity, and every realization of it called for Harrison's personal involvement. The finishing of an organ was a task Harrison almost invariably undertook himself, to prevent the slightest departure from the proud, highly polished norm. His perfectionism must have made him a demanding colleague, and photographs of him suggest a stern outlook; but portraiture has its conventions, and neither his working practices nor the unsmiling features then demanded by the camera should be allowed to obscure his fine personal qualities. There is humility of a genuine and touching kind in the sentence with which in 1929 this master organ builder at the height of his powers concluded a letter to a small church in Berkshire:<blockquote>We should very much like to build this organ for your Church, and I promise you that I would give it my careful personal attention and do everything possible to make it successful. (Archive of Harrison and Harrison Ltd, Durham)</blockquote>His final letter to George Dixon testifies to a capacity for warm and intimate friendship, and Elvin's account of the reaction to his death suggests that he was widely admired throughout the world of music. As one who enjoyed the patronage of the Church of England, the older universities, and a number of town and city councils, Harrison became something of an establishment figure himself, involved as he was with diocesan bodies and with the Federation of Master Organ Builders, of which he was for a time president. A diplomatic, socially sophisticated man, he moved easily among his clients.<br>
<br>In November 1936 Harrison interrupted the finishing of the organ at Westminster Abbey in order to undergo an operation for a suspected ulcer. Inoperable cancer was discovered, and he died on 14 November at 16 Fitzroy Square, London. The funeral took place at St Margaret's, Durham, on 18 November, and in 1937 a memorial window was placed in the chapter house of Durham Cathedral.<br>
<br>Harrison's style of organ building has withstood the twists and turns of fashion, so that instruments built under his auspices, especially those that survive unaltered, are highly regarded, both in Britain and abroad. That he was mainly concerned with tonal design and voicing has tended to obscure the vitally important contribution of his younger brother, Harry Shaw Harrison (1871&#150;1957), who concentrated upon mechanical design. The battleship construction and consequent reliability of Harrison organs and their characteristically elegant, comfortable consoles were, however, an integral (and much appreciated) part of the overall concept, and it was for these things that Harry was responsible. His early career followed very closely that of Arthur; it fell to him to oversee the completion of the Westminster Abbey organ and steer the firm through the vicissitudes of the Second World War. He retired in 1945.<br>
