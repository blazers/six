<span class="headword">Malvern,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>William Parker]</span>  (1485<span class="mult">x</span>90&#150;1539), <span class="occ">abbot of Gloucester</span>, was born into a Gloucestershire family named Parker, and received his early education at St Peter's Abbey in Gloucester. The monks then sent him to Oxford, where he had received the degree of BCL by April 1507; he subsequently returned to the abbey and became a monk there. Presumably it was then that he took the name of Malvern. Oxford later awarded him three additional degrees: DCL (1508), BTh (1511), and DTh (1515). At St Peter's he soon became supervisor of the works before being elected abbot on 4 May 1514. Like a number of other heads of religious houses of his generation Malvern devoted himself to improving the fabric of the abbey in order to assert its antiquity and wealth. Thus he built a tomb for King Osric, who had founded the abbey about 680, thereby emphasizing St Peter's claim to be one of the oldest religious foundations in the realm, and in 1524 he wrote a history of the founding of the abbey in rhyming verse. He also built an elaborate tomb and chapel for himself, and was probably responsible for adding a gallery range along the inside of the north precinct wall, and for rebuilding the two gates in the south wall. In addition, he carried out other responsibilities incumbent on his office. As a mitred abbot he sat in parliament on several occasions. He also received royal visitors: Princess Mary in 1525 and Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in 1535.<br>
<br>The abbey was not only the most imposing edifice in the city of Gloucester, it was also the dominant local landlord, holding property worth &pound;155 3<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. in 1539. This, as well as the commoning rights it shared with the city, created animosity that had exploded in conflict just a year before Malvern became abbot. However, his tenure seems to have been relatively peaceful in that respect. He was able to turn his attention primarily to activities and responsibilities that would enhance his own reputation and that of his community. Hence he concelebrated the mass with the archbishop of Canterbury and numerous others when Wolsey received his cardinal's hat on 18 November 1515, and he was one of several abbots chosen to attend upon Wolsey at Dover when Charles V visited England in 1522. He also represented the abbot of Westminster in a reforming visitation of Malmesbury Abbey in 1527.<br>
<br>During the last fifteen years of his life Malvern seems to have dealt with conflicting demands on his position with relative success. In particular, when he had to choose between supporting the king and the pope, he supported the king. He was one of the many signatories to a letter to Pope Clement VII &#145;praying him to consent to the King's desires&#146; for a divorce  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 6513). He also subscribed to the royal supremacy in June 1534 (along with thirty-six members of his house). However, he did not reject traditional theology. In response to questions relating to the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>, he opposed priests' marrying, stated that scripture did not prohibit either auricular confession or private masses, and asserted that administration of the sacrament in both kinds was not necessary. At the time of his death, on or about 9 June 1539, the dissolution of the major monasteries was already in progress, and he undoubtedly realized what lay ahead for his community. Others would surrender St Peter's Abbey, but the chaos surrounding the dissolution may explain why he was not buried in the elaborate tomb he had constructed for himself; his place of burial is unknown.<br>
