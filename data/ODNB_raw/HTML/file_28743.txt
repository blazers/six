<span class="headword">Waring,  John Burley</span>  (1823&#150;1875), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 29 June 1823 at Lyme Regis, Dorset, the son of Henry Waring (1773&#150;1837), a captain in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Franks (1789&#150;1842). From 1836 he was educated at the Bristol branch of University College, London, where he was also taught watercolour drawing by Samuel Jackson. In 1840 he was apprenticed to his second cousin Henry E. Kendall, a London-based architect. Then in 1842 he became a student at the Royal Academy, and obtained a silver medal at the Society of Arts for designs in architectural adornments in 1843. His health was never robust and he spent the winter of 1843&#150;4 in Italy &#145;to improve himself in art and to become a painter&#146;  (Waring, 9). On returning to England he was elected an associate of the RIBA in 1845 and became a draughtsman successively in the offices of A. Poynter, Laing of Birkenhead, Sir Robert Smirke (1846), and D. Mocatta (1847).<br>
<br>With Thomas R. Macquoid, Waring went to Italy and Spain in 1847 and studied architecture, measuring and drawing the public buildings. The result was an illustrated work entitled <span class="italic">Architectural Art in Italy and Spain</span>, which was published in 1850. For this all he received was a small payment for lithographing the sixty fine folio plates. He also produced <span class="italic">Designs for Civic Architecture</span>. From 1850 to 1852 he studied under Thomas Couture in Paris and afterwards lived at Burgos, where he studied the monuments at the Cartuja de Miraflores. In conjunction with Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt he wrote four architectural guidebooks to the courts of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham in 1854. While again in Italy in 1855 he made a further series of drawings, which were purchased for the South Kensington Museum, and published in 1858 as <span class="italic">The Arts Connected with Architecture in Central Italy</span>.<br>
<br>Waring was appointed superintendent of the works of ornamental art and sculpture in the Manchester exhibition of 1857, and edited <span class="italic">Art Treasures of the United Kingdom from the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester</span> (1858). He was elected FRIBA in 1860. In the International Exhibition at Kensington in 1862 he was the superintendent of the architectural gallery and of the classes for furniture, earthenware, and glass, goldsmiths' work and jewellery, and objects used in architecture. In connection with this exhibition he published <span class="italic">Masterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture</span> (3 vols., 1862), consisting of 300 coloured plates and descriptions, which were in English and French. He was chief commissioner of the exhibition of works of art held at Leeds in 1868. An extract from his exhibition report was published as <span class="italic">The National Exhibition of Works of Art at Leeds</span> (1867). He was interested in ancient glass paintings and wrote an introduction to C. Winston's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Drawings from Ancient Glass Paintings</span> (1865); he also wrote on <span class="italic">Ceramic Art in Remote Ages</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">Stone Monuments, Tumuli and Ornament of Remote Ages</span> (1870). During a further tour in Italy he sent a series of notes to <span class="italic">The Architect</span>. In February 1871 the American Institute of Architects elected him an honorary member, but he obtained little practice.<br>
<br>Waring wrote several books on the subject of the church, faith, and doctrine, and was also the author of a volume of <span class="italic">Poems: by an Architect</span> (1858). At the age of twenty he had been an enthusiastic follower of Swedenborg's doctrines; later he somewhat changed his opinions, and in his <span class="italic">A Record of Thoughts on Religious, Political, Social, and Personal Subjects</span> (2 vols., 1873), he advanced an eccentric claim to write under &#145;special divine inspiration&#146; and the power of making prophecies concerning political events. Latterly resident in London, he was described as a widower in the census returns of 1871 but no record of a marriage has been located. He died at the Castle Hotel, Hastings, on 23 March 1875.<br>
