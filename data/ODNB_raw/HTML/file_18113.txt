<span class="headword">Marsh,  John</span>  (1752&#150;1828), <span class="occ">musician and writer</span>, was born on 31 May 1752 at Dorking, Surrey, the first of the five children of Henry Marsh (1713&#150;1772), captain in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Mary 
    (Molly; 1715&times;20&#150;1759)
  , probably the daughter of Edward Tyler, a dissenting tradesman of Dorking. The loss of eleven days after the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in August 1752 resulted in John Marsh's celebrating his birthday on 11 June. In 1757 Marsh's father was posted to one of the royal yachts at Greenwich, where in 1759 young John started his education at Greenwich Academy. Five years later Captain Marsh was sent to Portsmouth, a move that led to Marsh's being sent to complete his education at Bishop's Waltham school. In 1765 he commenced a diary, subsequently transferred to a series of journals, that would prove the foundation of his principal claim to fame. These journals, or &#145;History of my private life&#146;, as Marsh entitled his work, were assiduously maintained until a few weeks before his death. Running to thirty-seven volumes and a total of 6704 pages, the journals are now housed in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California, USA, which purchased them at auction in 1990. The previously known version in the University of Cambridge Library is a much-abridged adaptation by Marsh's youngest son, Edward Garrard Marsh.<br>
<br>Today the journals are of value not only for the details they provide of Marsh's own life, but for the vivid account of life in the cathedral cities of southern England in which he lived and worked. From them we learn that Marsh incurred parental displeasure by resisting attempts to persuade him to follow his father into the Royal Navy. Instead in 1768 he became articled to a solicitor in Romsey, Hampshire, completing his legal training at the Inner Temple in London in 1773&#150;4. While Marsh was in Romsey he developed the early interest in music formerly discouraged by his father, teaching himself to play several instruments, inaugurating a series of subscription concerts, and making his first attempts at composition. Returning from London, where he took every advantage to experience the vibrant musical life of the capital, Marsh set up as a lawyer in Romsey. On 15 November 1774 he married Elizabeth Catherine Brown (1756/7&#150;1819), daughter of a Salisbury apothecary, Henry Brown, and his wife, Dorothea. Their first son, John (<i>d</i>. 1832) was born the following year. He was followed by four other sons, and a daughter, of whom only Edward Garrard and Henry reached adulthood.<br>
<br>Feeling restricted by the small-town atmosphere of Romsey, Marsh moved his family to Salisbury in 1776, entering into a legal partnership. He rapidly became fully involved in the thriving musical life of the city, playing in the subscription concerts and annual festival. This fresh stimulus was conclusive in deciding where Marsh's true interests lay. During the next seven years he was more likely to be found composing symphonies or anthems than attending to legal matters. After inheriting a large family estate in Kent and removing his family to Nethersole House near Barham, in 1783, Marsh unsurprisingly gave little time to the legal profession. He was now offered the management of the ailing Canterbury concerts, which immediately benefited from his organizational skill and ability to work with the sometimes uneasy mixture of professional and amateur players who performed in eighteenth-century provincial orchestras. However, Marsh soon found the expense of running a large country house too great. Nethersole was sold and, after a short interregnum in Canterbury, the family moved to a house in North Pallant, Chichester, Sussex, in April 1787. This remained his home for the last forty years of his life. As at Canterbury, Marsh found concert life in Chichester in a poor state following a schism. Here too he was offered management of the subscription concerts, skilfully reconciling the warring parties into a management committee while retaining overall control of repertory and the financial affairs of the orchestra. The orchestra, utilizing the services of the wind and brass players of the local Sussex militia, was expanded in size, enabling Marsh to programme a judicious combination of the ancient (primarily Corelli) and modern styles. Many of his own symphonies and other orchestral works were introduced into the repertory, along with those of J. C. Bach and Haydn. Marsh's success in reviving concert life in Chichester is reflected in a report in the <span class="italic">Sussex Weekly Advertiser</span> of 14 April 1804, at the end of the 1803/4 season: &#145;The concert, as usual, was distinguished for the excellence of selection, under the influence of its leader and director, J. Marsh, Esq., an amateur of fortune, whose compositions and skill have long since obtained him the highest estimation&#146;. The Chichester concert continued in a flourishing state until 1813, when after twenty-five years Marsh finally stepped down from the directorship.<br>
<br>While music forms the principal thread running through John Marsh's life, it was by no means the only interest of the lively mind revealed in his writings. A lifelong interest in astronomy was stimulated by a meeting with William Herschel in Bath and led to his publishing two books on the subject. His other literary works included a satirical novel, <span class="italic">A Tour through some of the Southern Counties of England, by Peregrine Project and Timothy Type</span> (1804). As a gentleman with a reasonably comfortable income from the Kentish estate retained after he moved to Chichester, Marsh was an inveterate traveller whose reaction to the death of his wife in 1819 was to undertake a tour to Scotland involving a round journey of some 1440 miles. His observations on musical life in London, to which he was a frequent visitor, are among the most valuable of the period. A staunch Anglican who in 1822 became involved with a society concerned with the conversion of the Jews, Marsh's faith did not preclude withering criticism of some of the clerics with whom he came into contact. In his later years Marsh turned increasingly to charitable work, being involved with the first Lancastrian schools to be established in Chichester and the anti-slavery movement. In accord with the times in which he lived, Marsh reveals little of his own emotions in his journals, but the picture that emerges is of a man of great energy, considerable leadership qualities, and an innate kindness which was not to be imposed upon. A natural family man, his consideration for his frequently ailing wife is one of many endearing traits to emerge from his writings.<br>
<br>The catalogue of John Marsh's musical compositions, many of them now lost, is substantial. It includes over fifty symphonies and other orchestral works, nearly thirty chamber works, organ music, a large number of services and anthems, and secular vocal works. He died at his home in North Pallant, Chichester, on 31 October 1828 after a short illness, and was buried at All Saints, West Pallant, on 7 November.<br>
