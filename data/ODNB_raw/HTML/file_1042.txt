<span class="headword">Bagshaw,  Christopher</span>  (1552&#150;1625?), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was the son of George Bagshaw, a prosperous innkeeper in Lichfield, who came from a Derbyshire gentry family. His mother was Joanna, daughter of Richard Parsons. He seems to have matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1566, and then to have migrated to Balliol College, Oxford, where he became a probationer fellow in 1572, graduating BA in the same year and MA in 1575. While at Balliol he quarrelled with, and helped secure the ejection of, another fellow, Robert Persons, later the famous Jesuit. Balliol was noted for its Catholic tendencies, but Bagshaw was orthodox at this time and in 1579 he became principal &#145;or at least deputy for a time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.390) of Gloucester Hall. He was also appointed a prebendary at Lichfield Cathedral, where his elder brother, a Church of England clergyman all his life, held a similar position. In 1582 Bagshaw left Oxford, travelling to the English College at Rheims, where in 1583 he was ordained as a Catholic priest. He was then sent to the English College at Rome, but was expelled from that institution in 1585. There is sufficient evidence that he was a difficult, irascible character who, being forced to live a collegial life in various places, found it almost impossible to do so without quarrelling with his fellows. It is fair to say, though, that much of the evidence for his love of faction and quarrels comes from his enemies, who seemed to be prepared to give as good as they got. He returned to Rheims from Rome, stopping briefly at Padua on the way, where he was awarded a doctorate of theology, presumably on the strength of his studies elsewhere.<br>
<br>Bagshaw then set out immediately in that same year of 1585 for England and was arrested within a very short time of his arrival in the country. He seems to have been carrying a letter to Scotland, sent by two agents of Mary, queen of Scots, in Paris, Charles Paget and the bishop of Ross. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he stayed for about two years. He was a co-operative prisoner, and one of whom the government decided not to make an example. He was released, at least temporarily, in early 1588 and returned home to Lichfield. Then in March 1588 he was committed again to prison by the government, and sent to Wisbech Castle, Cambridgeshire, where he was to stay for the bulk of the next thirteen years. There were a number of Catholic priests interned at Wisbech, where they formed perforce a sort of college. At Wisbech there developed a quarrel between a group led by Bagshaw and one under another difficult character, the Jesuit William Weston. The &#145;Wisbech stirs&#146; came to a head in 1595 and grew out of a series of disputes which had been brewing among English Catholics for at least fifteen years, and which were a matter of personalities, factions, strategy, and politics.<br>
<br>In 1598 Bagshaw became involved in the movement to overturn the appointment by the pope of the pro-Jesuit George Blackwell as archpriest. Bagshaw co-operated with the government to some degree in this, which may account for his being summoned to the Tower for a time in 1598, although it was also because he had been implicated in the Squire plot by an informant. Bagshaw was a leading figure among the opponents of Blackwell, who were known as appellants from their appeal to Rome against the appointment. He helped to concoct many of the memorials produced by the affair and composed or contributed to a number of the controversial pamphlets which the appellants published. His writings were characterized by extreme hatred of the Jesuits, especially of the leading English member of the society and erstwhile colleague of Bagshaw's at Oxford and Rome, Robert Persons.<br>
<br>Bagshaw was described in 1600 as being &#145;red-headed, gross and of low stature&#146;  (Anstruther). It was fitting that in 1601 he should be allowed by the government to be one of the party of four priests who set out to go to Rome on a second mission to appeal against Blackwell's appointment. Bagshaw got no further than Paris. Here he settled for the rest of his life, although there is a report that he was in Derbyshire in 1610. In 1612 he was involved in a public religious disputation with the English ambassador's chaplain in Paris, and, even according to the latter's report, gave a good account of himself. He is reported as having died in 1625.<br>
