<span class="headword">Rait, Sir  Robert Sangster</span>  (1874&#150;1936), <span class="occ">historian and university principal</span>, was born on 10 February 1874 at Narborough, Leicestershire, elder son and fourth child of David Rait and his wife, Elizabeth Sangster, who both came from Aberdeen. David Rait's service with the Inland Revenue took them back to Aberdeen, and Robert was educated at Old Meldrum parish school, Aberdeen grammar school, and King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA in 1894. After acting as assistant to the professor of logic and attending classes in the Free Church Divinity Hall he won an exhibition in history at New College, Oxford, in 1896. H. A. L. Fisher was one of his teachers and among his friends was John Buchan, who nominated him for the post of secretary of the Oxford Union in 1898.<br>
<br>Rait was awarded a first class in modern history in 1899 and in the same year won the Stanhope essay prize for &#145;The Scottish parliament&#146;, published in 1901 as <span class="italic">The Scottish Parliament before the Union of the Crowns</span>. Elected to a fellowship at New College in 1900, he found life as a fellow, lecturer, and tutor congenial. For three years he was dean and for five years librarian. His students included Philip Kerr, later marquess of Lothian and ambassador to the USA. He published an edition of <span class="roman">Acts of the Interregnum</span> (1911) and biographies (1903, 1911) of two Victorian field marshals: Viscount Gough, who had served in the Peninsular War, Ireland, China, and India where his tactics during the Sikh wars in the 1840s had been controversial; and Sir Frederick Haines, a veteran of Crimea. In 1908 Rait married Ruth Edith Mary, elder daughter of John Charles Edward Bridge of Aylesbury. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>There had been extensive publication of Scottish historical sources, both officially and by private societies, during the nineteenth century, and with the foundation of the Sir William Fraser chair at Edinburgh in 1901 the subject became recognized by the universities. A decade later Glasgow University followed with its chair of Scottish history and literature, in which history dominated. Rait had a natural interest in the history of his native land&#151;his first book (1895) was a history of the two universities of Aberdeen and he edited sources on Mary, queen of Scots (1899)&#151;and he was appointed to the Glasgow post in 1913.<br>
<br>From 1915 to 1918 Rait served in the war trade intelligence department in London and was appointed CBE. As professor, he did not confine his writing to specialist readers: besides a one-volume history of Scotland (1915) and a history of the Union Bank (1930), he made many anonymous contributions to the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> and surveyed modern developments in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> new volumes (13th edition). He contributed to the <span class="italic">Scottish Review</span> under John Buchan's editorship in 1907 and to Nelson's <span class="roman">The Teaching of History</span> series under Buchan as general editor from 1928 to 1930. With a junior colleague, George Pryde, he wrote <span class="italic">Scotland</span> (1934), a collaboration which Pryde described as a command performance interrupting his editorial work for the Scottish History Society. Rait became president of the society in 1933 in succession to Buchan and took the opportunity to reproach English historians for their contemptuous attitude to Scottish history.<br>
<br>Rait's most important book, <span class="italic">The Parliaments of Scotland</span> (1924), returned to the subject of his Oxford Stanhope essay. Modifications in detail later emerged, for instance in regard to committees under the covenanters and the electoral system. At about the time of Rait's death the Scottish committee of the history of parliament began a study of burgh and shire commissioners which was eventually completed in 1992. It has been claimed that Rait, mesmerized by Stubbs's view of English history and taking an overly constitutional approach, exaggerated the subservience of parliament. Nevertheless the book has remained for remarkably long the standard work on the subject.<br>
<br>In 1929 Rait was appointed principal of Glasgow University by the secretary of state for Scotland. Some observers were surprised that he decided to resign as historiographer royal for Scotland, an office which went back to the time of the Restoration and which he had held for ten years in succession to Professor Hume Brown. He did so with regret, taking the view that, although no specific duties were required, the post of historiographer royal should pass to someone who would have more time for any necessary research work than his new responsibilities would allow.<br>
<br>Rait was principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Glasgow at a time of economic stringency. His main achievements were to introduce new arrangements for the faculty of divinity following the union of the Church of Scotland and the Free Church, to sell Queen Margaret College to the BBC, and to provide for a new chemistry building. Colleagues found him approachable, but to others he appeared increasingly distant. He was knighted in 1933, elected an honorary fellow of New College, Oxford, in the same year, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Aberdeen (1921), Glasgow (1930), and Edinburgh and Lyons (1933). He was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant of Glasgow. From the time when the National Library of Scotland was founded by the transfer of the Advocates' Library in 1925 he had been a trustee, and he became chairman in 1932. In addition to his residence in Glasgow he owned a house at Blairmore on the Clyde coast.<br>
<br>In September 1935 Rait became ill, and in May 1936 he announced that he would resign at the end of September; his condition deteriorated, however, and he died at the Principal's Lodging, Glasgow University, on 25 May 1936; his wife survived him. His reputation as principal inevitably became somewhat overshadowed by the outstanding tenure of his successor, Sir Hector Hetherington, but the expansion of Scottish historical studies after the Second World War owed much to Rait's academic leadership.<br>
