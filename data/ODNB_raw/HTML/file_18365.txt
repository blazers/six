<span class="headword">Maule,  Fox</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Fox  Maule-Ramsay]</span>, second Baron Panmure and eleventh earl of Dalhousie  (1801&#150;1874), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 22 April 1801 at Brechin Castle, Forfarshire, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18370/', "William Ramsay Maule (1771&#150;1852), first Baron Panmure of Brechin and Navar")</script>, Forfarshire, and second son of the eighth earl of Dalhousie, and his wife, Patricia Heron (<i>d</i>. 1821), daughter of Gilbert Gordon from Halleaths in Dumfriesshire. The Maule family claimed eleventh-century Norman origins and were prominent in the Jacobite uprisings. Named after Charles James Fox, a political and personal friend of his father, he had two brothers, Lauderdale (1807&#150;1854), a lieutenant-colonel in the Cameron Highlanders, and William (1809&#150;1859), and seven sisters: Patricia (<i>d</i>. 1859), Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1852), Mary (<i>d</i>. 1864), Georgiana (<i>d</i>. 1833), Ramsay (<i>d</i>. 1884), Christiane, and one unidentified. His father married second Elizabeth Barton in 1822, but had no further children. Two of Fox Maule's uncles, James (1772&#150;1837) and John (1775&#150;1842), became lieutenant-generals, the ninth earl, George (1770&#150;1838), a general. Maule was educated first at a private school in Clapham, then at Charterhouse School in central London between 30 June 1809 and May 1818. While he was at Charterhouse his father and mother separated. Fox Maule supported his mother and never saw his father again, being settled with a &pound;100 annual allowance and an army commission. After briefly attending Edinburgh University, he therefore joined the 79th regiment of foot (or Cameron Highlanders) as an ensign on 3 June 1819, advancing to lieutenant on 29 July 1824, brevet captain on 8 April 1826, and regimental captain on 31 October 1826. During these years Fox Maule served as aide-de-camp to his uncle Lieutenant-General the earl of Dalhousie, then commander of the forces in North America, leaving Canada with him in August 1828. A year later Maule was at the regimental depot in Dublin, and formally retired on 5 April 1831.<br>
<br>Maule had married Montagu (<i>d</i>. 1853), eldest daughter of George, second baron Abercromby, the day before, on 4 April 1831; they had no children. After leaving the army Maule settled at Dalguise in Perthshire but soon entered politics as Liberal MP for Perthshire (1835&#150;7), then Elgin burghs (1838&#150;41), and Perth until he succeeded to his father's peerage on the latter's death, on 13 April 1852. Under Lord Melbourne, except for a short period in 1837&#150;8 when he was not in parliament, he served as under-secretary of state in the Home department (1835&#150;41). In 1841 he became a privy councillor and was briefly vice-president of the Board of Trade. Maule was appointed to the War Office as secretary at war in Lord John Russell's government in July 1846, entering the cabinet in that post in October 1851 and succeeding Lord Brougham as president of the Board of Trade in January 1852. A month later the government fell. Before taking charge of the War Office in 1846, he had shown a close interest in military administration on matters such as the reopening of Kilmainham Hospital to Irish pensioners and ration allowances for troops in the colonies. He wrote, too, several papers about measures to combat Chartist disturbances. Once in office, he dealt with a vast range of issues involving pensions, accounts, contracts, and patronage.<br>
<br>A mutiny in New Zealand, unrest at the Cape of Good Hope, feared insurrection in Ireland, desertions from regiments in Canada all claimed his attention, too, besides more general governmental concerns about India, the Spanish occupation of Cuba, and the Don Pacifico affair. Prolonged inquiries by a parliamentary select committee on army and ordnance expenditure took up a considerable amount of his time between 1849 and 1851. When Palmerston succeeded Lord Aberdeen as prime minister in February 1855, Panmure became secretary of state for war and as such had ministerial responsibility for the Crimean campaign. He quickly insisted that a chief of staff (Sir James Simpson) be appointed to ensure that the orders of the British commander, Lord Raglan, were &#145;quickly and implicitly obeyed&#146; and also &#145;to enquire into the manner in which the Staff Officers perform their duties and to report fully thereon&#146;  (Hibbert, 253). Referring to dissatisfaction at home arising from &#145;the grievances in the camp&#146;, Panmure harshly (and wrongly) assailed Raglan for not visiting his soldiers, adding: &#145;Your staff must be changed, at least that will satisfy the public and that radically&#146;  (ibid., 254). Before the end of February 1855 he revealed his transparent preoccupation with personal survival: &#145;I must do something to satisfy the House of Commons&#146;  (ibid., 257).<br>
<br>The deficiencies in support services, highlighted by use of pensioners to care for the sick and wounded, and of exhausted soldiers to undertake non-military maintenance and construction duties, and the reliance on civilian contractors for land transport led to a number of <i>ad hoc</i> bodies being sent to the theatre of war. Panmure's predecessor (the duke of Newcastle) had dispatched a mounted staff corps to assist with camp policing and a civil engineering corps to build a railway between the port of Balaklava and the trenches. Panmure additionally established a military Land Transport Corps, which evolved into a permanent post-war organization, and the civilian Army Works Corps for manual non-operational work, which foreshadowed the Royal Pioneer Corps. More immediately, he sponsored fundamental, lasting military reform at home. Hitherto, the master-general of the ordnance had commanded the artillery and engineers as a separate corps quite independent from the rest of the army. He had also controlled the civilian Board of Ordnance, which provided military supplies generally and a wide range of financial, supply, and administrative services for overseas garrisons. Within a week of becoming secretary of state, Panmure drew up proposals for &#145;placing the purely military branch of the Ordnance forces under the C-in-C, and the civil branches under the Minister (Secretary of State) of War&#146;  (Sweetman, <span class="italic">War and Administration</span>, 70). On 6 June 1855 an order in council achieved the desired changes, which were truly fundamental. Panmure had achieved something of a palace coup: the master-general (Raglan), being otherwise engaged in the Crimea, could only belatedly and vainly protest. Brusquely the secretary of state replied: &#145;The change at the O [<i>sic</i>] is effective and I am sorry to hear you anticipate so much confusion from it&#146;  (Sweetman, <span class="italic">Raglan</span>, 316). Seeking to show initiative as complaints mounted of unsatisfactory conditions at the front, Panmure sent Sir John McNeill and Colonel Alexander Tulloch to the Crimea to investigate criticisms of the supply system. Their two reports caused such high dudgeon among those blamed that Panmure appointed a board of general officers under Sir Alexander Woodward to examine their complaints and interview the aggrieved. The board vindicated senior officers such as lords Lucan and Cardigan and was widely dismissed as a whitewash. That was hardly Panmure's fault. He was more culpable over Lord Lucan, recalled from the Crimea following heated objection to Raglan's view that, as the divisional commander who ordered the light brigade up the valley to destruction, he (Lucan) bore responsibility for its fate. Lucan clashed with Panmure once in London, and according to Lord Granville &#145;Mars [Panmure] had invited the latter [Sir Henry Hardinge, the army commander-in-chief] to break Lucan&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 219). The commander-in-chief refused, believing Lucan had been provoked, whereupon &#145;Mars had sworn at Hardinge, and threatened to turn the whole press loose upon him&#146;  (ibid.). Granville recorded that the prince consort suspected these exchanges had hastened Hardinge's death from a stroke. Frustrated by the failure of the allied forces to advance aggressively against the Russians once the main part of Sevastopol had fallen, Panmure hectored Sir James Simpson into resignation, vigorously defending himself to the queen (11 October): &#145;In that message [the dispatch containing news of Simpson's resignation] there is not a word which Lord Panmure was not fully justified in using&#146;  (Douglas and Ramsay, 1.436).<br>
<br>Patently, Panmure did not lack self-confidence. In cabinet meetings on 11 and 21 December 1855 Granville whimsically noted that &#145;Mars then gave us his strategical views of the operations in the Crimea&#146;, and after &#145;an interesting letter was read from Miss Nightingale &hellip; Mars said it only showed that she knew nothing of the British soldier&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 130, 133). Visiting Panmure, who was suffering from gout &#145;in both arms and both legs&#146; on 13 January 1856, Granville found him &#145;reading a book of Scotch divinity; very pompous and oracular on literature and politics&#146;. The bedridden secretary of state declared that &#145;Macaulay's History is not a history; it is merely pot-house gossip&#146; and went on to discuss the current diplomatic moves to end hostilities. &#145;I am neither warlike nor peaceable&#146;, he exclaimed, &#145;but I say that if we cannot have an honourable peace, we must have a bloody war&#146;  (ibid., 141).<br>
<br>Even as peace hopes rose in January and February 1856 a convalescent Panmure composed lengthy memoranda for the duke of Cambridge in Paris and Sir William Codrington, Simpson's successor as British commander in the Crimea, on the future conduct of operations. After the armistice on 29 February, he immersed himself in details of the army's peacetime establishment, celebratory firework displays in the London parks, the strength of coastal defences, and the building of Netley Military Hospital. On 21 February 1856, in the Lords, &#145;Mars spoke like Apollo&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 167) in arguing that ambiguity in the responsibilities of the secretary of state and the commander-in-chief of the army must be clarified. Five months later, he unequivocally established the authority of his office over that of the commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>Panmure's energy remained seemingly boundless, but his hot temper (reputedly inherited from his father) caused offence. His nickname the Bison was not wholly due to his unruly mop of hair. He did not serve in any government after Palmerston's first ministry fell in February 1858, and according to Granville was so angry that he threatened to sit on the cross-benches when Palmerston excluded him from his new ministry in 1859. Difficulty in working with colleagues and even the prime minister may explain his exile. Granville thought &#145;Mars more pompous than ever&#146; over the Indian mutiny  (Anderson, 256); Clarendon, though, considered him &#145;a much more wily creature than he used to be &hellip; there is no other single member of the Cabinet who can defy the Prime Minister&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 114). Not unnaturally, perhaps, Newcastle was &#145;sore and hates Mars&#146; for taking credit for many reforms that his predecessor had set in train  (ibid., 161). Panmure's petulant and stubborn refusal in the Lords on 24 July 1857 to countenance a public memorial to Raglan scarcely extended his range of political supporters. Influential military figures also deplored his treatment of Raglan, who had written to a nephew, &#145;sometimes I think Lord Panmure believes I am either criminally negligent or a lunatic&#146;  (Hibbert, 264). Panmure had an unhappy knack of offending too many people.<br>
<br>Panmure supported the Free Church of Scotland from its formation in 1843, and engaged in years of fractious correspondence about crown patronage in the Church of Scotland. He commented unfavourably on &#145;the Puseyite principles of Gladstone and Sidney Herbert&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 345). Granville dubbed him &#145;a Scotch divinity &hellip; more fitted to conduct a campaign in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland than on the shores of the Black Sea&#146;  (ibid., 102). He became deeply involved in the efficiency of Scottish universities, and was made lord rector of Glasgow University in 1842. Between 1850 and 1871 he served as the first non-Catholic governor of Charterhouse since Cromwellian times, being &#145;particularly industrious in the work he found fixed upon him &hellip; and always took a pleasure in promoting the true interests of the School&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Carthusian</span>, 135). On 19 December 1860 he succeeded as eleventh earl of Dalhousie to the Scottish estates of his cousin James Andrew Ramsay, governor-general of India (1847&#150;56). By royal licence in 1861 Maule added Ramsay to his own name. He was a knight of the Scottish Order of the Thistle, knight grand cross of the Bath, keeper of the privy seal of Scotland, lord lieutenant of Forfarshire, and a commissioner of the royal military asylum. The barony of Panmure became extinct when he died without issue on 6 July 1874 at Brechin Castle, his birth place. He was buried at Panbride, Forfarshire, on 14 July. His cousin Admiral George Ramsay succeeded him as earl of Dalhousie.<br>
