<span class="headword">Procter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Shaw]</span>,  Doris Margaret <span class="st"> [Dod]</span></span>  (1890&#150;1972), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 7 Greencroft Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 21 April 1890, the only daughter of Frederick Charles Shaw, a ship's doctor, and his wife, Eunice Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richards (<i>b</i>. 1859/60), an artist who had studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. When Doris was young the family moved to Tavistock, Devon, where Dr Shaw died. They moved again in 1907 to Myrtle Cottage, Newlyn, Cornwall, and Doris studied painting under Stanhope Forbes at his Meadow Studios in the town during 1907&#150;8. Fellow students there were Ernest Procter, her future husband, and Laura Knight, a lifelong friend, who described Doris as &#145;a charming young thing, with a brilliant complexion, enormous dark eyes and long slender legs&#151;swift and active as a gazelle&#146;  (L. Knight, <span class="italic">Oil Paint and Grease Paint</span>, 1936, 161&#150;2).<br>
<br>In 1910&#150;11 Doris Shaw studied painting at the Atelier Colarossi in Paris, following the advice of <a name="cosubject_64733"></a><span class="headword">Ernest Procter</span>  (1886&#150;1935)<span class="occ"></span>, who was already there. Ernest was born on 22 May 1886 at Tynemouth, Northumberland, the second son of Henry Richardson Procter (1848&#150;1927), who became head of the leather industries department at Leeds University and professor of applied chemistry there, and his wife, Emma Lindsay, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. After attending the Quaker school, Bootham, at York he enrolled at Leeds Art School about 1905&#150;6 and then studied at the Stanhope Forbes Art School, Newlyn, before entering the Atelier Colarossi. Doris and Ernest returned to Newlyn in 1912 and married on 9 April at Paul parish church; they travelled to Paris and Versailles for their honeymoon. On their return to Newlyn they rented Dunton House, where their only child, Bill, was born in February 1913. Also in 1913 they had their first joint exhibition of watercolours at the Fine Art Society in London. By 1923 they had moved to North Corner, Newlyn, an old fisherman's cottage. Here, in unlikely circumstances, they created a magical garden, with grottoes and brilliant patches of coloured planting, all surrounded and protected by a high granite wall. Doris lived here until her death in 1972, and the garden was the subject of many of her paintings.<br>
<br>In 1919 both painters were invited to paint murals for the Kokine Palace in Rangoon, Burma, belonging to the Chinese millionaire Lim Ching Tsong. They travelled to Rangoon in December 1919 and worked at the palace for a year, assisted by Burmese, Indian, and Chinese craftsmen. Shortly after her return to England, Doris began a series of portraits of young women, depicted in simplified, rather sculptural forms. She sent her work to mixed exhibitions at the Leicester Galleries, London, from 1913 to 1935. She first sent a painting to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1913, a Versailles subject inspired by her honeymoon visit. In 1916 and 1917 she sent flower paintings and in 1922 a Burmese scene. But from 1923 she sent paintings of women. She also began exhibiting under the androgynous name of Dod rather than Doris.<br>
<br>In 1926 Dod and Ernest Procter had their second joint exhibition, this time at the Leicester Galleries. In 1927 Dod's painting <span class="italic">Morning</span> (Tate collection), which depicted Cissie Barnes, the daughter of a Newlyn fisherman, asleep on a bed, was voted the picture of the year at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. It was bought for the nation by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> newspaper. On Dod's return to Newlyn from visiting the opening of the exhibition at the Royal Academy, flags were hung in celebration of her success and she was led home from the station by a silver band. <span class="italic">Morning</span> was so popular with the public that it was toured round regional galleries in Britain, being seen by 60,638 visitors at Birmingham City Art Gallery during February 1928. It was sent to New York on the ship <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, and on its return it was given to the Tate Gallery. A two-page illustrated article entitled &#145;Painting the picture of the year&#146; describes the artist thus:<blockquote>Not very tall, slight and dark, modern looking and extremely feminine &hellip; [with] her shingled head, her pearl stud earrings, slim, silk-stockinged legs and neat feet &hellip; her legs crossed, her large dark eyes reflective, a long, thin, black cigarette holder in her extremely sensitive, slender hand &hellip; surround an outstanding personality illuminated brilliantly from within when art, which is the real business of her being, is under discussion. Then there is clarity and conviction in everything she says. (Tate collection, archives)</blockquote>As a result of Dod's successes at the Royal Academy summer exhibitions during the second half of the 1920s, the Procters rented a flat in London, first at 26 Stanley Gardens, Belsize Park, then at 32 Elsworthy Road, Primrose Hill. In 1929 the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition jury rejected Dod's painting <span class="italic">Virginal</span>, a full-length nude figure of a young woman, and she sent it instead to the Leicester Galleries. The genitals of the young woman were visible, and this was probably the reason for its rejection. However, she was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1934, a rare distinction for a woman painter, and only the third woman in the academy's history. She was made a Royal Academician in 1942.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Dod Procter continued to paint her favourite subject of women, but her style became softer and more painterly. She joined the New English Art Club and showed with them between 1929 and 1932. Two paintings were bought for the nation under the terms of the Chantrey Bequest during the 1930s (<span class="italic">The Orchard</span>, 1934, and <span class="italic">Kitchen at Myrtle Cottage</span>, 1935; Tate collection) and one by the Contemporary Art Society in 1931. Procter contributed regularly to the prestigious Carnegie Institute's international exhibitions at Pittsburgh, and in May 1935 she was given a show at the Carl Fischer Gallery in New York. Ernest Procter died on 21 October 1935 in North Shields, Northumberland, and after his death Dod started to travel, both for work and for pleasure. She visited Canada and America in 1936; the Canary Islands in 1938 and 1946; Tenerife in 1938 and 1939; and Jamaica four times in the 1950s. On many of these travels she was accompanied by the painter Alethea Garstin, a close friend. She painted in Ireland during the Second World War, and her subjects at this time included flower pieces. Dod died in Newlyn on 31 July 1972, and was buried alongside her husband, Ernest, in the churchyard of St Hilary nearby. Her work is in Oldham Art Gallery; the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne; the Atkinson Art Gallery, Southport; the City Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent; Penlee House Gallery, near St Ives, Cornwall; and the Tate collection.<br>
