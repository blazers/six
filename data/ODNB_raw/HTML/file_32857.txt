<span class="headword">Donaldson,  St Clair George Alfred</span>  (1863&#150;1935), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born at 22 Rutland Gate, Westminster, London, on 11 February 1863, the third of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7805/', "Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson (1812&#150;1867)")</script> of Pangbourne, Berkshire, first premier of New South Wales, and his wife, Amelia, daughter of Frederick Cowper of Carleton Hall, Cumberland. He was nephew to the philologist J. W. Donaldson and younger brother of Sir Stuart Donaldson, master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and vice-chancellor, whom he much admired. Educated at Eton College (1877&#150;81), Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took double firsts in classics (1885) and theology (1887), and Wells Theological College, St Clair Donaldson was made deacon in May 1888 by the bishop of London and immediately joined the diocesan mission at St Andrew's, Bethnal Green. He served simultaneously as a resident chaplain to Archbishop E. W. Benson of Canterbury, who in December 1889 priested him. In October 1891 he joined the Eton College Mission, first at St Augustine's, Hackney Wick, and then as vicar of St Mary, Hackney Wick (1894&#150;1900) and head of the mission. In May 1901 he was mentioned as organizing secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel but in January 1902 he became rector of Hornsey, Middlesex, and rural dean nine months later. In 1903 he was elected president of the London Junior Clergy Missionary Association.<br>
<br>After an abortive election in 1903, the synod of the diocese of Brisbane delegated the choice of its fourth bishop to the archbishop of Canterbury alone. Randall Davidson had been resident chaplain with Donaldson at Lambeth Palace. Donaldson's Australian connections, his London experience in the East End and at Lambeth, his moderate high-churchmanship, and independent means all commended his nomination. He was consecrated in St Paul's Cathedral, London, by Davidson on 28 October 1904, and enthroned in St Luke's Pro-Cathedral, Brisbane, on 21 December. Created archbishop in 1905, he was metropolitan of Queensland, the most coherent province in Australia, and he very nearly became primate in 1909.<br>
<br>Upon an uneven Australian bench, Donaldson stood out for his statesmanship, spiritual leadership, common sense, and unfailing good humour. His devotion and piety in private were matched by his vision and oratory in public. As diocesan of Brisbane, he built upon the financial and administrative structures set by his predecessor, W. T. T. Webber; here he was ably assisted by two men who accompanied him in 1904, Henry Le Fanu, his archdeacon (and after 1915, his coadjutor), and Francis de Witt Batty, his chaplain. Conscious of the complaint that the diocese was a &#145;practising shop&#146; for English clergy on five-year contracts, in his seventeen years in Brisbane Donaldson doubled the number of his clergy, of whom in 1921 half were Australian born and trained. In 1905 he established at Charleville the least monastic of the three Queensland bush brotherhoods. At Nundah, a Brisbane suburb, he revived as a provincial institution a former diocesan theological college, dedicated in 1907 to St Francis: as metropolitan, he controlled the placement of all its students, often favouring the weaker dioceses of the province. In 1911, within a year of the opening of the University of Queensland and largely through his private benefaction, St John's Residential College for Men was founded: it failed, however, to provide a stream of ordinands. Donaldson encouraged the diocese to eschew primary education, already provided by the state and numerous Roman Catholic convents, and to concentrate upon secondary day and boarding-schools, for boys and girls. These included the Glennie School for Girls, Toowoomba (1908), St Hilda's Southport (acquired by the church in 1911), the Southport School (1901), acquired in 1913, and the renamed Brisbane Church of England Boys' Grammar, acquired in 1914. The choir, transepts, and first bay of St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, a French Gothic revival masterpiece designed by J. L. Pearson, were consecrated on 28 October 1910, the first public occasion upon which all the bishops of the province vested in copes and mitres. St Martin's Hospital, adjacent to the cathedral, was opened in 1921 as a war memorial. Long concerned with such social and moral issues as gambling, temperance, and birth control, Donaldson finally held a general mission to the province in 1917; it was a qualified success.<br>
<br>Donaldson's greatest influence in Australia was felt beyond his diocese. On his election he welcomed the opportunity to work in a disestablished church; he quickly discovered the constraints imposed by the &#145;legal nexus&#146; between the Australian church and the Church of England in the United Kingdom. He determined first to define that nexus, then to break it. He envisaged an autonomous Australian church, able to play an independent and prominent part in national affairs. In 1912 he helped prepare the questions upon which learned opinion was sought in England and which long remained the basis of the movement for autonomy. His farewell public speech in Australia was his peroration to the debate on this question at the 1921 general synod. The Brisbane church congress of 1913 owed much to his planning and leadership. With Bishop Gilbert White, he tried to reorganize general synod and its subsidiary, the Australian board of missions. Before the war Donaldson joined the Brisbane branch of the Round Table, which often met at Bishopsbourne; during the war, he actively encouraged recruitment. His Lenten series of addresses in the cathedral was published as <span class="italic">Christian Patriotism</span> (1915). As a senior chaplain to the armed forces he was annoyed by what he considered the indecisiveness of the primate and the chaplain-general. His speeches and correspondence with Archbishop Davidson reveal his support for imperial responsibilities but his distaste for jingoism and for national and state politicians and their sectarian outbursts, which he despised.<br>
<br>While Donaldson was in England in 1913&#150;14, largely through the influence of his only sister, May, wife of the Hon. the Revd Algernon Lawley, his translation to an English see was mooted. The war intervened; but in October 1921, Donaldson was translated to Salisbury, so that he could inaugurate a post-war mission to the church overseas. His initial attempts to abandon the palace at Salisbury as his residence failed; he used it instead to entertain youth (the &#145;bishop's lipstick parties&#146;) and educated laity with minimal church affiliations. To lighten his administrative responsibilities, in 1925 he revived the suffragan see of Sherborne and attempted to have Le Fanu appointed. He became consultant on all matters Australian to successive archbishops of Canterbury. From 1921 to 1933 he was foundation chairman of the Church of England missionary council and inaugurated the Jerusalem Chamber Fellowship of Prayer; here he showed skill, patience, and practical wisdom, born of his Australian experience. In 1926 he was appointed to the Church of England council of overseas settlement. He supported the &#145;deposited&#146; prayer book of 1928. In 1931 he was appointed to chair the joint committee of the convocation of Canterbury on &#145;The church and marriage&#146;, which reported in 1935.<br>
<br>Donaldson received many awards, including honorary doctorates of Cambridge (1904), Durham (in civil laws, 1908), and Oxford (1920); in 1923 he became an honorary fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and in 1933, knight commander and prelate of the Order of St Michael and St George. He published in his lifetime only the customary discourses of diocesan bishops; however, <span class="italic">A Meditation on the Acts of the Apostles</span> (London, 1937) reveals his intense personal piety. He died unmarried at the palace, Salisbury, on 7 December 1935 and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 11 December.<br>
