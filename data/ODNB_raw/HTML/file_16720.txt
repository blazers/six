<span class="headword">Lindsay,  William Schaw</span>  (1816&#150;1877), <span class="occ">shipowner and politician</span>, was born at Ayr. His family details are sketchy, but he was probably the third son of Joseph Lindsay, and his mother's maiden name was Schaw. His will names two sisters, one of whom was married to the prominent United Presbyterian clergyman, John McKerrow. Orphaned early in life Lindsay came under the guardianship of his uncle, William Schaw (<i>d</i>. 1847), of Ayr, a minister of the Secession church. After early schooling, at the age of fifteen he ran off to Liverpool, determined to pursue life as a seafarer. After some weeks of destitution he secured a berth as a cabin-boy in the <i>Isabella</i>, a West Indiaman, and after three years he became second mate. Shortly afterwards he was shipwrecked, in the course of which he broke both legs and an arm. He recovered to become the chief mate of the <i>Olive Branch</i>, owned by a Mr Greenwell of Sunderland, and a year later he was master, at the age of twenty. In 1839 he received a sabre wound from a pirate, whom he then shot dead, in the Persian Gulf.<br>
<br>In 1840 Lindsay left the sea and Greenwell secured his appointment as fitter for the Castle Eden Coal Company at Hartlepool&#151;the beginning of Lindsay's career in business. In 1842 he married Helen Stewart of Glasgow; the couple had at least one son. Through his wife Lindsay became connected to the family firm of iron-founders, and when he went to London in 1845 he acted as agent for his brother-in-law, in addition to his coal-fitting and shipbroking activities. W. S. Lindsay &amp; Co., of Austin Friars, in the City of London, rapidly became one of the largest shipowners in the world with, at one stage, 220 vessels in its fleet. The Crimean War offered Lindsay the opportunity to charter steamers to the French government on particularly remunerative terms.<br>
<br>Lindsay also pursued parliamentary ambitions and, after unsuccessful attempts at Monmouth and Dartmouth in 1852, he was returned as MP for Tynemouth and South Shields in March 1854. At the general election of 1859 he withdrew from the contest in this constituency and was returned instead for Sunderland. As an MP he championed the shipping interest, naturally enough, and took an interest in naval as well as commercial matters. He took an active part in the Administrative Reform Association. However, his support for the Confederate states in the American Civil War, together with other maverick tendencies, caused some consternation among his supporters.<br>
<br>Lindsay's political and business careers ended in 1864 when he lost the use of his legs. Retiring to the seclusion of his home, Shepperton Manor, Shepperton, Middlesex, he turned his energy to writing. He had already published various pamphlets, as well as more substantial works such as <span class="italic">Our Navigation and Mercantile Marine Laws</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">Our Merchant Shipping</span> (1860). He fictionalized many of his experiences for the anonymously published <span class="italic">Log of my Leisure Hours</span> and the unfinished <span class="italic">Recollections of a Sailor</span>. However, his monument as a writer is his authoritative four-volume <span class="italic">History of Merchant Shipping and Ancient Commerce</span> (1874&#150;6). He died at Shepperton Manor on 28 August 1877, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Lindsay's energy and driven personality were evident in all that he undertook. His remarkable career took him from cabin-boy to MP, by way of merchant prince, and when he was incapacitated he was still only in the prime of life. That he provoked strong feelings was inevitable, but the combination of admiration and unease he aroused was best expressed by another shipowner, Alfred Holt, who wrote of him as being &#145;a strange mixture of energy, industry, self-reliance, egotism and pretence&#146;  (Jones, 2.132).<br>
