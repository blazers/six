<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Thomas</span>, third Lord Fairfax of Cameron  (1612&#150;1671), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was born at Denton, Yorkshire, on 17 January 1612, the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9081/', "Ferdinando Fairfax, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1584&#150;1648)")</script>, and his first wife, Mary Sheffield (<i>d</i>. 1619), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25293/', "Edmund Sheffield, first earl of Mulgrave")</script>. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1626, and entered Gray's Inn in 1628.<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitarycareer16291635"></a>Early military career, 1629&#150;1635</h2>Between 1629 and 1632 Fairfax travelled in France and the Low Countries, where he learned the art of war under Horace Vere, Baron Vere of Tilbury. Present at the siege of Bois-le-Duc in 1629, he then visited France and elsewhere, returning to England in 1632 in the vain hope of obtaining his grandfather's permission to join the Swedish army in Germany. On 20 June 1637 he contracted an arranged (but in the event happy) marriage with Anne Vere (<i>d</i>. 1665) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66848/', "Fairfax, Anne, Lady Fairfax")</script>], the second daughter and coheir of his old commander and his widow, Mary. With her he had two daughters: Mary, born in 1638, and Anne, who was born in 1640 and died two years later.<h2>
<a name="MilitaryserviceunderCharlesI16391640"></a>Military service under Charles I, 1639&#150;1640</h2>Fairfax fought for Charles I in the first bishops' war against the Scots in 1639, commanding a troop of 160 Yorkshire dragoons. He also participated in the second bishops' war, commanding 150 horse under Lord Conway. According to Burnet, after the English defeat at Newburn, Fairfax, as he freely admitted, shared in the general panic of the fleeing army: &#145;all were put in such great disorder, that the whole army did run with so great precipitation, that sir Thomas Fairfax &hellip; did not stick to own, that till he passed the Tees his legs trembled under him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.51). Half a year later, on 28 January 1641, the king knighted him, perhaps in the hope of cementing his allegiance to the crown.<br>
<br>However, the humiliating defeat at the hands of the Scots had completed the undermining of Charles's government, and compelled him to summon parliament once again. When civil war broke out in 1642, Fairfax, in spite of the honour recently bestowed on him, was prominent among the supporters of parliament in Yorkshire. On 3 June the freeholders and farmers of the county assembled at Heworth Moor near York, in obedience to a royal proclamation. Those gentry and freeholders who wanted the king to reconcile himself to parliament had drafted a petition to Charles, which Fairfax was selected to present. At the meeting Fairfax had to force his way past royal courtiers, who attempted to block him, but at last he reached the king's side and placed the petition on the pommel of his saddle. Charles refused to accept it, and pressed his horse forward, nearly trampling Fairfax underfoot.<h2>
<a name="Militaryserviceinparliamentsnorthernarmy16421645"></a>Military service in parliament's northern army, 1642&#150;1645</h2>Fairfax also signed the protest of the Yorkshire parliamentarians on 29 August 1642, which prompted John Rushworth to write to Ferdinando, &#145;the House is much contented with Sir Thomas Fairfax's noble carriage of Thursday last&#146;  (Bell, 3.18). He was also among the negotiators of the Yorkshire treaty of neutrality of 29 September. When parliament annulled the treaty, he became second in command to his father, and general of horse. Accompanied by his wife, he distinguished himself in minor battles at Wetherby and Tadcaster at the end of 1642. With scarcely 1000 men in the northern parliamentary army, however, Fairfax and his father were no match for the earl of Newcastle and his well-equipped royalist army of 9000 men. Nevertheless, on 23 January 1643 Fairfax won his first notable victory, driving the royalists out of Leeds, forcing Newcastle to take refuge in York, and leaving the country open between Selby and the west. But two months later (30 March 1643) Lord Goring delivered a severe defeat on Seacroft Moor, as Fairfax was engaged in covering the retreat of his father and the main body of his army from Selby to Leeds. Despite being completely routed, Fairfax did achieve his main objective of enabling his father's larger force to effect its retreat. Writing to Prince Rupert about this episode, Secretary Edward Nicholas termed Fairfax &#145;the man most beloved and relyed upon by the rebells in the north&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18980, fol. 33<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The position of the northern army was now precarious. With the impetuosity of youth Fairfax conceived the idea of attacking Wakefield, which he believed was occupied by no more than 800 or 900 royalist troops. By the time he found out that they in fact numbered 3000 it was too late, and he had to press ahead, leading the assault on the town from the front. He personally took several prisoners, was himself almost captured, but in the end was completely victorious. Among the 1400 royalist prisoners was General Goring himself. No victory against such heavy odds was won by any other general during the whole civil war.<br>
<br>Fairfax was allowed only a short time to savour his success. The weakness of the northern army meant that he had to abandon Wakefield and rejoin his father at Leeds. Newcastle was now advancing on Bradford with about 12,000 men. On 30 June the Fairfaxes rode out to meet them on Adwalton Moor with a quarter that number. Leading the right wing of cavalry, Sir Thomas initially repulsed the royalist horse, but the left wing was completely overthrown, and in the end the royalists' superior numbers carried the day. Fairfax personally brought off a number of his troops safely into Halifax, returning during the night to take charge of the besieged town of Bradford. Coming under extreme pressure the next day, he cut his way through the besieging army with about fifty horse, and rejoined his father at Leeds.<br>
<br>After the disaster at Adwalton Moor, Leeds could not be defended for long; in the first week of July, therefore, the Fairfaxes retreated to the one remaining parliamentarian garrison in Yorkshire: Hull. Sir Thomas took charge of the rearguard, was shot through the wrist, and suffered a serious loss of blood before he finally reached safety.<br>
<br>While Ferdinando maintained the defence of Hull, Sir Thomas Fairfax took the cavalry, which were of no use in the besieged town, to join Cromwell and Manchester in Lincolnshire. There he contributed to the parliamentary victory at Winceby on 11 October 1643. In the face of a large body of royalist cavalry Fairfax was reported to have cried, &#145;Come let us fall on; I never prospered better then when I fought against the enemy three or four to one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scotish Dove</span>, 13&#150;20 Oct 1643, 5). In his letter to the House of Lords Manchester eulogized him as &#145;a person that exceeds any expressions as a commendation of his resolution and valour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary or Constitutional History of England</span>, 12.423).<br>
<br>Fairfax was now beginning to be recognized as one of parliament's most valuable commanders, and further exploits were just around the corner. On 20 December, in the company of Sir John Meldrum, he retook Gainsborough by storm. His great accomplishment in 1643, in combination with his father, was to keep Lord Newcastle and his army, which had swelled to 12,000 or more, pinned down in the north, so that they could not march south and join forces with the king. According to his nineteenth-century biographer Markham, the most striking quality of the Fairfaxes was their &#145;inability to understand that they had been beaten &hellip; no odds [were] too great for the enterprising spirit of Sir Thomas Fairfax&#146;  (Markham, 123).<br>
<br>At the end of 1643 parliament decided that Fairfax's services were required on the other side of the country, where Nantwich had come under siege. The royalist build-up in Cheshire was now all the more menacing thanks to the addition of reinforcements from Ormond's army in Ireland. Crossing the Pennines in the dead of winter, Fairfax brought to Nantwich a relief force of 2800 horse and 500 dragoons, to which he added 3000 foot from Lancashire and Cheshire recruited on the way. In conjunction with Sir William Brereton and the governor of Nantwich, Sir George Booth, he attacked the royalist army under Lord Byron. The action, on 29 January 1644, was a complete success. All the royalist colonels and 1500 prisoners were taken. It furnished a tremendous boost to parliamentary morale.<br>
<br>By March Fairfax was back in Yorkshire joining forces once again with his father. Newcastle by now had his hands full trying to keep the Scottish army under Lord Leven at bay in Durham. The parliamentarian plan was for Sir Thomas and Ferdinando to rendezvous at Selby and march from there to link up with the Scots in Durham. When the royalist governor of York, John, Lord Bellasis, got wind of the plan, he decided to intercept the Fairfaxes at Selby. The engagement there on 11 April 1644 was a shining parliamentarian victory, to which the younger Fairfax's cavalry contributed greatly. Fairfax's stock at once rose higher at Westminster, and parliament proclaimed a day of public thanksgiving. Clarendon, unaware of his previous feats, believed that Selby &#145;was the first action Sir Thomas Fairfax was taken notice for&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.310).<h2>
<a name="MarstonMoor"></a>Marston Moor</h2>Selby led directly to the battle of Marston Moor and the destruction of royalist power in the north. When the news of it reached Durham, both Newcastle and Leven hastened to bring their armies into Yorkshire. Newcastle occupied York with 6000 troops, while Leven's Scots and the Fairfaxes' northern parliamentarian army, together now 20,000 strong, besieged the city. By the beginning of June the earl of Manchester had arrived with over 6000 troops from the eastern association, and the city was completely encircled. Meanwhile Charles I had sent Prince Rupert on a recruiting expedition in Lancashire, and on 30 June he arrived at York with 14,000 men intending to raise the siege. The allied parliamentarian and Scottish forces withdrew to Marston Moor, 7 miles beyond the city, and prepared for the largest battle ever to be fought on English soil. On the fateful day (2 July 1644) Fairfax commanded the horse on the right wing, consisting of fifty-five troops of Yorkshire cavalry, and twenty-two of Scots&#151;about 4000 men in all. While his own regiment charged successfully, the rest of his division was routed; it was with difficulty that he made his way, wounded, at the head of his own regiment, through the ranks of the enemy to the parliamentarian left, who were victorious. Although his contribution to the battle itself was not distinguished, he and his father had laid the groundwork for the victory by holding out for more than a year against overwhelming odds, and by their decisive conquest of Bellasis at Selby, which had triggered the siege of York, and the ensuing battle beyond its walls.<br>
<br>At the siege of Helmsley Castle the following month Fairfax was dangerously wounded by a musket ball, which broke his shoulder. It was not the last of the many wounds he suffered during a long military career.<h2>
<a name="TheNewModelArmy"></a>The New Model Army</h2>While Fairfax was slowly convalescing from this wound the political struggle against the existing parliamentarian commanders in the south was nearing its climax. In December the Commons passed the resolution for a self-denying ordinance to exclude the members of both houses from all commands. Though rejected by the Lords, the Commons majority proceeded as if it had been passed. The three existing armies were amalgamated, and by a Commons vote of 101 to 69 Fairfax was named commander-in-chief of the new entity, soon to be known as the New Model. The choice of Fairfax was the product of several factors. At the age of thirty-two he had already chalked up an impressive military record. A stranger to political manoeuvre, he had few enemies at Westminster. Perhaps he was already seen as politically malleable. At any rate, the men with whom he and his father corresponded in the early 1640s show that he had important friends in the war party, of which Oliver Cromwell was an increasingly prominent member. Looking back later, Fairfax declared that he was overwhelmed by the burden placed on his shoulders.<blockquote>I was so far from desiring it that had not so great an authority commanded obedience, being then unseparated from the royal interest, besides the persuasions of nearest friends not to decline so free and general a call, I should have hid my self to have avoyded so great a charge. (&#145;Short Memoriall&#146;, Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 36, fol. 3<i>v</i>)</blockquote>At first the Lords were unwilling to allow Fairfax to appoint his own officers. At length a compromise was worked out with the Commons by which the commander-in-chief was to appoint his officers in the first instance, but submit their names to parliament for final approval. In the event the two houses attempted to change a third of Fairfax's list. Almost all the changes were suggested by the Lords with the aim of eliminating or demoting radicals and promoting moderates and presbyterians. In the end the Commons majority browbeat the Lords into accepting, by the narrowest of majorities, the list that Fairfax had submitted. Political wrangling was even more bitter over the wording of his commission. The Lords baulked at the attempt by the Commons war party to exempt Fairfax from the obligation to preserve the king's safety on the battlefield. Only by dint of persistent bullying was Fairfax, unlike his predecessors, relieved of the pretence that he was fighting the king's evil counsellors and not the king himself.<br>
<br>It was not just Charles I who scoffed at the new army and its &#145;brutish generall&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Kings Cabinet Opened</span>, 1645, 3). Friends as well as foes would shortly be compelled to revise their opinions. In April Fairfax was engaged in reorganizing the New Model. In May he left Reading, under instructions from the committee of both kingdoms to relieve Taunton. But before he could get there, he was redirected to besiege the royalist headquarters at Oxford. Meanwhile the king was in the field recruiting his army. &#145;I am very sorry&#146;, Fairfax wrote to his father, &#145;we should spend our time unprofitably before a town, whilst the king hath time to strengthen himself, and by terror to force obedience of all places where he comes&#146;  (Bell, 3.228).<h2>
<a name="Naseby"></a>Naseby</h2>When the king's sack of Leicester cruelly exposed the strategic ineptitude of the committee of both kingdoms, Fairfax was finally given the free hand he sought to direct his own field operations. On 14 June, with close to 17,000 soldiers at his command, he met a royalist army of less than 9000 at Naseby. To Cromwell belongs the credit for the battle formation and the successful charge of cavalry on the right wing, but contemporaries were agreed in awarding the laurels for the day's victory to Fairfax. When he saw the rout of the left wing of cavalry, and the distress of the infantry in the middle, he commanded Cromwell to wheel about and divide his forces. The two generals then charged from opposite sides into the royalist infantry, bringing relief to their own beleaguered regiments. Fairfax then re-formed the whole army for a second advance on the royalist lines. This time he was careful to ensure that the horse did not leave the ranks of the foot exposed by too impetuous a charge. Sighting the monolithic approach of the New Model and overawed by its crushing superiority of numbers, the remnant of the king's army now turned tail and fled. The genius that Fairfax revealed at Naseby did not lie in his strategic capability, but in his popularity with his men, his flawless courage, and his ability, reinforced by years of experience, to respond to the unpredictable fluidity, the breathtaking rush of events during the two hours when the outcome of the English civil war was decided.<h2>
<a name="Langport"></a>Langport</h2>Once he had recaptured Leicester, Fairfax marched to the south-west to confront Goring, who commanded the only remaining royalist field army of any importance, at Taunton. On Fairfax's approach Goring withdrew from Taunton, and the two armies met at Langport. Staging an audacious charge across a swollen stream and up a steep hill, Fairfax quickly destroyed Goring's cavalry. This follow-up to Naseby was decisive. There he had struck the king a mortal blow. Then swinging round to face the only other army in the field, he lunged at Goring. The war was effectively over, although the participants were not yet aware of this fact. Ahead lay eleven more months of sieges, pitched battles, cold, hunger, sickness, and anxiety. Bridgwater, Bath, and Sherborne were taken in quick succession. Bristol was a tougher nut to crack. The second port in the realm, protected by 15-foot-thick walls, it was the main distribution point for the king's weaponry, ammunition, and materials. The letter in which Fairfax summoned Prince Rupert to surrender the city contains an interesting exposition of his political creed at that time. He assured the prince that neither he nor parliament harboured any animus against the institution of monarchy. Rather, they were fighting &#145;to maintain the rights of the crown and kingdom joyntly; a principal part whereof is, that the king &hellip; is &hellip; to be advised &hellip; by his Parliament, the great Counsel of the Kingdom, in whom &hellip; he hears all his people as it were at once advising him; and in which multitude of councellours lyes his safety, and his peoples interest&#146;  (Sprigge, 98). It was similar to the political philosophy that his father had proclaimed on his own battle flag: &#145;Long live the king, but death to bad government&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 5247, fol. 20<i>v</i>). After a three-week siege and heavy artillery bombardment which failed to open a breach in the walls, the city was finally overrun on 10 September in a lightning assault. Showing great daring, Fairfax's infantry scaled the walls as withering fire was poured down upon them.<br>
<br>By the time of the winter respite the remaining royalists were mostly bottled up in Devon and Cornwall. It did not take long to reduce Tiverton, Dartmouth, Torrington, Exeter, and the remaining Cornish strongholds. Hopton's small army capitulated on 14 March. At Torrington Fairfax had a narrow escape when eighty barrels of gunpowder were blown up in the royalist magazine. Writing afterwards to his father, he expressed gratitude for &#145;God's great mercy to me and some others that stood where great webs of lead fell thickest, yet, praised be God, no man hurt&#146;&#151;apart from the 200 royalist prisoners who were killed by the explosion  (Bell, 3.285). Fairfax's last task was to invest Oxford. As his 3000 cavalry approached, Charles slipped out of the city in disguise and surrendered himself to the Scots, leaving Sir Thomas Glemham the distasteful task of yielding up the royal headquarters. Wishing to spare Oxford's intellectual and aesthetic treasures, Fairfax granted generous terms, and the city was handed over on 24 June 1646. Aubrey later hailed him as the saviour of the Bodleian for putting a strong guard around the library to stop the thieving and vandalism of books that had been tolerated by the royalists during their occupation.<br>
<br>The fifteen months culminating in the surrender of Oxford were the most glorious period of Fairfax's life. Out of the remnants of three older armies he had welded together a supremely effective fighting force. After his initial stunning success at Naseby he had driven the royalists before him in a long string of victorious battles, sieges, and storms. Under his leadership the New Model Army never lost so much as a skirmish. At all times until the beginning of 1647 he was in control of this army, first of all shaking off the irksome interference of the committee of both kingdoms, and then several times bringing his council of war around to his way of thinking, or on occasion simply overruling it and ordering the implementation of strategies he had decided upon.<h2>
<a name="Healthandillness"></a>Health and illness</h2>In July Fairfax and his wife, both unwell after the rigours of more than a year's intensely active service, fled to Bath to take the waters there and restore their health. All his life Fairfax was a sickly individual, notwithstanding his physical courage and his boundless energy on the battlefield. The &#145;infirmities&#146; of his body to which Sprigge alludes  (Sprigge, 323) were many. In the autumn of 1645 it was rheumatism; by mid-1646 he was afflicted with kidney stone; two years later he was suffering from gout. Yet ill health never seemed to stop him from being present at the scene of military action when he was needed. It did, however, give him a ready-made excuse for absenting himself from the army's councils when awkward political issues were being contested. Thus, in the second civil war he threw himself into the thick of the battle at Maidstone (2 June 1648) despite the pain of a terrible fit of the gout. By contrast, in the spring of 1647, as the army became politically turbulent, Fairfax excused himself, pleading illness. When he went to London in April for medical treatment, Holles angrily accused him of merely pretending to be sick so as to let the army revolt boil out of control. He was said to be sick when the army seized the king, and again throughout the autumn of 1647, when the Leveller challenge was being debated in the general council. He fell sick once more around the time of Pride's Purge in December 1648. On the 20th of that month he was too ill to meet sixteen of the imprisoned members of parliament who had been summoned to his lodging in Whitehall.<h2>
<a name="Thepoliticalwars16461648"></a>The political wars, 1646&#150;1648</h2>Apart from the brief interval of the second civil war, the three years from spring 1646 to winter 1649 were the most painfully embarrassing of Fairfax's life. The logic of events obliged him to tread paths he would sooner have avoided and to implement decisions that had been made by others. In the world of subtle intrigue and political manoeuvre he was out of his depth, and helpless to thwart the efforts of men far more adept than himself. The political crisis burgeoned in the late winter of 1646&#150;7, when the peace party led by Holles persuaded the Commons to send part of Fairfax's army to Ireland and disband most of the rest with only a fraction of their arrears of pay. The soldiers petitioned for all their arrears, and an indemnity act to protect them from prosecution for whatever they had done while in the army. Parliament instructed Fairfax to suppress the petition, and he did so, but ineffectually. When parliament heard that petitioning was continuing, Holles got it to approve a declaration that those who persisted in this illegal activity would be regarded as &#145;enemies to the state and disturbers of the public peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 9, 115). Conscientiously Fairfax strove to effect a rapprochement between the parliamentary commissioners and the officers, most of whom sympathized with the rank and file. When his efforts failed, he threw up his hands and retreated to London for a month (21 April to 20 May 1647) for medical treatment, though he did take the precaution of ordering all other officers to repair to their commands.<br>
<br>At the end of May parliament issued its final offer and ordered Fairfax back to the army. He communicated the offer to a meeting of officers at Bury St Edmunds, but it fell on deaf ears since the regiments had already begun to organize resistance to disbandment. The officers instead advised their commander to appoint a general rendezvous of the army to discuss the situation. Fairfax wrote back to parliament imploring them to back off. &#145;I intreat you that there may be ways of love and composure thought upon. I shall do my endeavours, tho' I am forced to yield something out of order, to keep the army from disorder or worse inconveniences&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary or Constitutional History of England</span>, 15.390). In the meantime he shifted his headquarters from Saffron Walden to the agitators' meeting place at Bury St Edmunds, but then fell ill once again. The collapse of Fairfax's control at this point was starkly exposed when on 2&#150;3 June, with Cromwell's covert support, Cornet George Joyce seized the king, and later without authority removed him from Holdenby. In his &#145;Short Memorialls&#146; Fairfax writes that he immediately dispatched Colonel Whalley with two regiments to reverse Joyce's flagrant disobedience. But Charles turned down Fairfax's efforts to get him to return, saying, &#145;Sir, I have as great an interest in the army as you&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 36, fol. 5<i>v</i>). A further rebuff to Fairfax came when the council of war rejected his proposal to punish Joyce. Nevertheless, writing to the House of Lords, he assured them &#145;as in the presence of God &hellip; that [Joyce's] remove of his Majesty from Holdenby was without any design, knowledge, or privity thereof on our parts; and a thing altogether unexpected to us&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary or Constitutional History of England</span>, 15.410).<br>
<br>Between June 1647 and the outbreak of the second civil war Fairfax was marginal to the army's political mobilization, its negotiations with the king, and its debates on the future constitution of England. He later disingenuously confessed,<blockquote>the power of the army (which I once had) was usurped by the forerunners of confusion and anarchy &hellip; the arbitrary and unlimited power of this new counsel would act without a General, and all that I could doe could not prevaile against this streame &hellip; For now the officers of the army were placed and displaced by the will of the new agitators who with violence so carried all things as it was above my power to restraine it.</blockquote>Again,<blockquote>I must needs say, from the time they declared their usurped authority at Triplo Heath [5 June 1647] I never gave my free consent to anything they did but (being then undischarged of my place) they set my hand by way of course to all their papers whether I consented or not. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 36, fols. 4, 4<i>v</i>, 6<i>v</i>)</blockquote>He twice tried to resign his commission but was prevented. He did, however, claim credit for one political achievement. He managed to delay the march on London to purge eleven leading presbyterian MPs long enough to allow those targets of the army's wrath to flee. Thus he &#145;diverted this humor of the army from being statesmen to their more proper dutye of soldiers&#146;, and postponed the purge of parliament by over a year  (ibid., fol. 5).<br>
<br>There is, however, other evidence that Fairfax was rather more active in these months than he later acknowledged. At the general rendezvous of the army near Newmarket on 4&#150;5 June he personally visited and addressed each regiment, to the rapturous joy of the soldiers. On 3 August he conducted the speakers of both houses and the MPs who had been forced to flee parliament by counter-revolutionary violence, on a review of the New Model Army, and three days later escorted the MPs back to their seats at the Palace of Westminster. He also vetoed several proposals in September to promote Cornet Joyce, John Wildman, and other radicals  (minute book of the committee of general officers, Worcester College, Oxford, MS 66, fols. 6, 12, 15<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="ThesecondcivilwarMaidstoneandColchester"></a>The second civil war: Maidstone and Colchester</h2>If ill health prevented Fairfax from playing any part in the Putney debates on the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, it did not stand in his way when the time came to return to the battlefield in 1648. While Cromwell rode west to suppress the insurrection in Wales, and Lambert was dispatched to the north to check the march of the Scots, Fairfax, who had recently inherited his father's Scottish baronage of Cameron, took responsibility for the south. At the end of May he led a force of 4000 to attack the royalist stronghold at Maidstone. In agonizing pain from gout he led his men on horseback, his right foot wrapped in a bandage, and was &#145;one of the first in all this action&#146;  (Whitelocke, 2.324). On 13 June he pursued the fleeing royalists to Colchester and settled down to a seventy-five-day siege. While Fairfax was at Colchester, Milton addressed a sonnet to him, summoning him to the &#145;nobler task&#146; of settling the kingdom and cleansing the land of avarice and rapine.<br>
<br>On 27 August, reduced to starvation and despair, the garrison surrendered, the rank and file to &#145;quarter&#146;, and the superior officers to &#145;mercy&#146;. The former term implied that their lives would be spared, but the latter meant that they would be at the mercy of the lord-general, who, as he explained ahead of time, would be &#145;free to put some immediately to the sword, if he see cause&#146;  (Rushworth, 7.1247). Using the discretionary power he had thus reserved himself, he tried Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle by court martial and had them shot to death. Norwich, Capel, and Hastings he turned over to parliament because they were peers. The justifications for the executions were several. First, according to the rules of war, officers who continued to hold an untenable position, thereby causing unnecessary bloodshed, forfeited their right to quarter. Second, an officer taken prisoner and then released broke his parole if he again bore arms against the enemy who had released him. At the beginning of the siege Fairfax had written to Lucas pointing out that he had broken the parole he had given when released at Marston Moor, and that he would therefore be excepted from mercy. The case against Lucas was clinched when two private soldiers testified that at Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire, he had ordered that over twenty captured prisoners be put to the sword in cold blood. &#145;[I]n this distribution of Justice&#146;, explained Fairfax in his &#145;Short memorials&#146;, &#145;I did nothing but according to my Commission and the trust vested in mee&#146;  (T. Fairfax, &#145;Short memorials&#146;, William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, fol. 24<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="ThearmyremonstrancePridesPurgeandregicide"></a>The army remonstrance, Pride's Purge, and regicide</h2>At about this time Edmund Ludlow came to the camp and urged Fairfax to put a stop to the treaty that parliament was about to negotiate with the king at Newport. Fairfax equivocated, so the republican Ludlow turned to Ireton, who agreed with him but cautioned that they should wait to see what agreement king and parliament came to before moving against them. That autumn one regiment after another petitioned Fairfax against the Newport treaty, and urged that the king be called to account as a man of blood. The remonstrance of the army, framed by Ireton and adopted by the council of officers on 16 November, demanded that the treaty be broken off and the king tried for treason. At the time Fairfax wrote to parliament that the remonstrance had been approved by the officers unanimously, but much later he maintained, and royalist intelligence at the time reported, that he &#145;absolutely refused to concurre&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 31, fol. 312).<br>
<br>Orders were issued in Fairfax's name for securing the king on the Isle of Wight and complaining to parliament for its laying aside of the remonstrance. Fairfax also put his name to a letter to the speaker of the House of Commons declaring that because of his failure to reply, &#145;we are attending and acting the providence of God, for the gaining of such ends as we have proposed in our aforesaid Remonstrance&#146;  (Worcester College, Oxford, MS 114, fol. 115). Nevertheless, it was almost certainly Ireton, not Fairfax, who was directing affairs at this moment. However, Fairfax strains credulity when he writes of Pride's Purge that the other officers planned the forcible exclusion of unfriendly MPs &#145;with that great secrecy as that I had not the least intimation of it till it was done &hellip; It was so secretly carried on that I should get no notice of it&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 36, fol. 6). He did not resign his command after this assault on the liberties of parliament, nor did he stop signing letters on behalf of the army, including a sardonic order to London to pay its assessment arrears, a rebuff of the Commons' demand to release their imprisoned members, and warrants for their confinement.<br>
<br>When it came to the king's trial, Fairfax finally rediscovered his courage, and began to work against his fellow officers. Named to the court of high commission, he attended the first preliminary session, perhaps thinking that the trial might be an instrument for either deposing the king or intimidating him into unconditional surrender. When the truth came home to him that the revolutionaries were in deadly earnest, Fairfax attended no further sessions despite strenuous efforts to secure his presence. On the first day of the trial, when his name was read out, his wife shouted from behind her mask in one of the galleries, &#145;he had more wit than to be here&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.486). On the day of sentencing (27 January), when the president of the court, John Bradshaw, declared that they were trying the king in the name of &#145;the commons and people of England&#146;, she intervened a second time, calling out, &#145;not half, nor a quarter of the people. Oliver Cromwell is a rogue and a traitor&#146;  (Hargrave, 1.370). The next day Fairfax hosted a meeting of officers at his house to hear a last-minute appeal from the Dutch ambassadors to save the king's life. On the 29th he summoned a council of war, where he implored his fellow officers to postpone the execution. Afterwards he wrote admitting his ineffectuality, but pleading &#145;my afflicted and troubled minde for it and my earnest endeavours to prevent it will, I hope, sufficiently testify my abhorrance of the fact&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 36, fol. 6). According to his cousin Brian Fairfax, on the eve of the execution, &#145;when some of his friends proposed to him to attempt the next day to rescue the king, telling him that twenty thousand men were ready to join with him; he said, he was ready to venture his own life, but not the lives of others against the army united against them&#146;  (B. Fairfax, 32). On the day itself he continued his efforts right up to the moment of beheading, in prayer or conversation with the officers in Colonel Thomas Harrison's apartment near the long gallery of the Banqueting House. When Bishop Juxon and Thomas Herbert were escorting the king's corpse back through the long gallery, they bumped into Fairfax, who to their amazement enquired &#145;how the king did&#146;, and &#145;seemed much surprised&#146; to learn that he was already dead  (Herbert, 194). The episode was a poignant comment on the commander-in-chief's political irrelevance.<br>
<br>Fairfax later underlined his disapproval of the king's death by the reservations that he made in his engagement to be faithful to the Commonwealth. Like the other peers who became members of the council of state, he declared that he had served the parliament faithfully, and was willing to do so again, since there was no longer any power but that of the House of Commons, but could not sign the engagement because it was retrospective. Besides sitting in the council of state Fairfax was also elected MP for Cirencester (7 February 1649), although he appears not to have taken his seat. He was also reappointed commander-in-chief of all the forces in England and Ireland (30 March 1649).<h2>
<a name="SuppressingtheLevellersandresignation"></a>Suppressing the Levellers and resignation</h2>As commander of the army Fairfax was personally involved in suppressing a mutiny in Colonel Whalley's regiment at the end of April 1649. Against Cromwell's plea for clemency, Fairfax insisted that the ringleader, Robert Lockyer, be executed. Lockyer instantly became a Leveller martyr. A little over two weeks later Fairfax had to cope with much more serious Leveller-inspired mutinies against the forthcoming Irish expedition: at Banbury, Burford, and Northampton. Leading a force of nearly 4000, he swiftly overtook the main body, 900 strong, and crushed their resistance in a late-night surprise attack at Burford. Once again Fairfax showed severity by pronouncing them all liable to the death penalty. In the end three mutineers were executed in Burford churchyard, and were added to the Leveller pantheon.<br>
<br>After this accomplishment Fairfax visited Oxford and was created a DCL on 19 May 1649, while many of his fellow officers were made honorary MAs. He remained in England during Cromwell's expedition to Ireland, but in summer 1650 he was nominated to lead the invasion of Scotland. Willing to oppose the Scots if they invaded England again, he could not in conscience invade their territory. &#145;Human probabilities are not sufficient grounds to make war upon a neighbour nation, especially our brethren of Scotland, to whom we are engaged in a solemn league and covenant&#146;  (Whitelocke, 3.209). A committee of the council of state including Cromwell, Whitelocke, and Harrison tried to change his mind, but he would not budge. In his letter of resignation he cited infirmities of mind and body, but commentators at the time agreed that it was the influence of his wife and the presbyterian clergy that had caused him to baulk at invading Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Literaryandreligiouspursuits"></a>Literary and religious pursuits</h2>For the rest of the interregnum Fairfax lived quietly at Nun Appleton, Yorkshire, where he nursed his health and devoted himself to literature and religion. Though elected for the West Riding of Yorkshire in the first protectorate parliament of 1654, he seems again not to have taken his seat. His energies were directed to building up a collection of coins and engravings, translating Vegetius from the Latin, and Mercurius Trismegistus from the French, and producing a metrical version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, as well as translating the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span> and other books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was perhaps inspired by Andrew Marvell, the tutor whom he engaged for his daughter in 1651&#150;2, and who is thought to have written much of his best poetry at Nun Appleton. While Fairfax's own poetry has no literary merit, his writing shows a sensuous appreciation of natural beauty that was at war with a puritan estrangement from the attractions of this world. His three volumes of sermon notes which he took during the twenty years before his death provide insight into his deeply religious nature. A non-sectarian puritan, he had a strong, simple belief in the dynamic role of divine providence in his life. At the same time that he had become politically passive he retained a millenarian hope. The &#145;gravious conflict&#146; of this world was but a preparation for &#145;a glorious conquest in the next&#146;  (Folger Shakespeare Library, MS V.a.14, unfoliated). As a Calvinist he believed in the &#145;originall corrupcion&#146; of his soul, which could be saved only by &#145;the meritts of the precious blood of Jesus Christ&#146;  (will, fol. 1). For Fairfax there was no contradiction in protecting the Bodleian Library and intervening to save the largest collection of medieval stained glass in England at York Minster on the one hand, while on the other holding that the appetite for material things was one of the devil's snares. During his retirement from public life he also found time to write a treatise on horse breeding and a history of the church up to the Reformation.<h2>
<a name="Familyandpropertyaffairs"></a>Family and property affairs</h2>As the heir to the ancestral estates of his family Fairfax was one of the leading gentry of Yorkshire. At the beginning of the civil war he had invested heavily in the war against the king. After 1645 that investment was amply repaid. As commander-in-chief of the New Model Army he was paid &pound;10 a day, and unlike every other officer in the army he was paid promptly and in full. Over the five-year period of his supreme command he garnered a salary of &pound;19,000  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Fairfax 32, fol. 173). As an additional expression of gratitude parliament voted him a jewel worth &pound;800 at the beginning of his generalship, as well as &pound;1000 worth of horses. Near the end of his generalship he was voted York House in the Strand and lands worth &pound;5000 per annum from the estates of the second duke of Buckingham. This was subsequently converted to a cash grant of &pound;10,000 and Buckingham estates to the value of &pound;4000 per annum.<br>
<br>The last thing parliament would have expected was that these very lands would revert to their original owner, as they did on 7 September 1657, when Fairfax married his daughter Mary to Buckingham. The marriage was said to have been arranged by Fairfax's mother-in-law, Lady Vere, and his cousin Major Robert Harley, a prominent presbyterian leader. The government regarded it with suspicion, partly as &#145;a Presbyterian plott&#146;  (Thurloe, 6.617), and partly because Buckingham was still regarded as a cavalier. When Cromwell ordered Buckingham to be arrested and thrown in the Tower, Fairfax at his daughter's behest went to Whitehall to demand his release. Cromwell was unyielding, and upbraided his former comrade-in-arms for not sticking with his old friends and taking their advice. Infuriated, Fairfax terminated the interview, &#145;turning abruptly from him in the gallery at Whitehall, cocking his hat, and throwing his cloak under his arm, as he used to do when he was angry&#146;  (B. Fairfax, 31). Later, after Cromwell died, Fairfax appealed to parliament for Buckingham's release. Several MPs spoke in favour, citing Fairfax's trustworthiness, and Buckingham was freed on 21 February 1659. But Fairfax was affronted by the requirement that he put up &pound;20,000 bail, and was reported to have said in private that<blockquote>since the dissolving of the [Long] parliament, which was broke up wrongfully, there was nothing but shifting and a kind of confusion; and that he knew not but he might chuse by his old commission as generall to appear in armes on behalf of the people of these nations. (Thurloe, 6.706)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="TheRestoration"></a>The Restoration</h2>In Richard Cromwell's parliament Fairfax sat for Yorkshire, and intervened rarely but effectively. He attracted particular admiration for opposing military rule. On one occasion he declared that parliament must not give the militia &#145;out of our hands to any single person, but that it must be intrusted where it may be serviceable to &hellip; the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 273). He was seen as a man devoid of ambition, who &#145;sides with republicans and carryes a name above Lambert&#146;  (Thurloe, 7.616), and some thought would make an excellent general once again. A sign of his high reputation was his election to the council of state on 19 May 1659, but he declined to serve.<br>
<br>By summer 1659, with the protectorate having collapsed and the struggle between the army and the Rump having ended in stalemate, the government was in disarray. By September General Monck had issued his call from Scotland for an end to military interference in politics. This was the break for which Fairfax had been waiting. Ever since his resignation as commander-in-chief he had scrupulously abstained from any involvement in royalist intrigue. But after Lambert's expulsion of the Rump in November he opened negotiations with Monck, employing his friend and former New Model Army chaplain the Yorkshire presbyterian Edward Bowles and Monck's brother-in-law Thomas Clarges as intermediaries.<br>
<br>At the same time that he declared his support, Fairfax also signalled his disapproval of Monck's apparent unwillingness to go any farther than recalling the Rump parliament. Monck responded that his hands were tied for the moment by his fear that his army would not support him. This was good enough reassurance for Fairfax, who sent back word that he would raise the county for Monck. By 30 December, so racked by kidney stone and gout that he had to travel to the rendezvous in a carriage, he mustered 450 supporters at Knaresborough. On new year's day the force, now swollen to 1800, besieged York, where Lambert had installed Robert Lilburne to hold the garrison against Monck and Fairfax. But the city was taken without a blow, and the next day Monck crossed the Tweed. Fairfax's raising of Yorkshire to neutralize Lambert's army was the key factor in the timing of Monck's march into England. Thanks to his preparatory work not a single unit of the English army opposed Monck. Fairfax thus deserves much of the credit for the achievement of a restoration without bloodshed. He alone was able &#145;to embody the moderate parliamentary gentry's revolt against military tyranny without either scandalizing the army or creating a premature breach between Presbyterians and commonwealthsmen&#146;  (Woolrych, 505). It was a fitting symbol of Fairfax's role in bringing back the king that the chestnut-brown horse which Charles II rode at his coronation was a gift from Fairfax's own stable.<br>
<br>Fairfax's conduct just prior to Charles's return proved that he was not an unqualified royalist. In April 1660 the cavaliers were startled to hear that he had joined Manchester and the presbyterians in an attempt to impose terms on Charles. But Monck made it clear that he alone would negotiate with the king. Nevertheless, Fairfax was honoured by being selected for the interim council of state on 3 March, by being elected member for Yorkshire in the same month, and by being chosen to head the commissioners of the two houses sent to the king at The Hague.<h2>
<a name="Finalillnessanddeath"></a>Final illness and death</h2>With Charles back on the throne Fairfax retired again to Nun Appleton. He was upset by the Cavalier Parliament's exclusion of regicides from the <span class="roman">Act of Oblivion</span>. If Ludlow can be believed, he candidly acknowledged &#145;that if any person must be excepted, he knew no man that deserved it more than himself, who being general of the army at that time, and having power sufficient to prevent the proceedings against the King, had not thought fit to make use of it to that end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.268). Illness blighted the remaining years of his life. He filled them with reading, religious duties, and composing autobiographical accounts of his service in the northern army and the New Model.<br>
<br>Lady Fairfax died on 16 October 1665, Fairfax himself on 12 November 1671. Both were buried in Bilbrough parish church, near York. In his will he left his Denton estate for the use of his daughter during her lifetime, with the reversion to his cousin Henry Fairfax after her death. He thereby kept it out of the grasp of his profligate son-in-law. His pious and generous nature was displayed in his bequest of half a year's wages to each of his servants, and &pound;100 to &#145;twenty poore ministers&#146;  (will, fol. 4). Other beneficiaries included a maimed soldier, and his cousin John Rushworth, who had been secretary to the New Model Army.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Many contemporaries vouched for the attractiveness of character that is reflected in Fairfax's will. To Joshua Sprigge, historian of the New Model, he was a man of &#145;the best piety&#146;  (Sprigge, 321) who neither played favourites nor let passion govern his acts. Charles I pronounced him &#145;a man of honour, faithfull to his trust, and one that ever kept his word with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speech to the Commissioners</span>, 3). While a correspondent of Clarendon called him &#145;a slow beast and inconstant&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 57, fol. 129<i>v</i>), the royalist secretary Edward Nicholas had to admit that he was &#145;most beloved&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18980, fol. 33<i>v</i>), and the parliamentary diarist Sir Simonds D'Ewes echoed the opinion of many when he called him &#145;very gallant&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 165, fol. 107<i>v</i>). Fairfax was never noted for fluency of speech, but he was heard attentively when he chose to voice his opinion. Popular with his men, he was at the same time a strict disciplinarian, who did not shrink from imposing the severest punishments when he thought the army's integrity was at stake. He won his men's loyalty by his care for their safety and his carelessness for his own. When it came to political scheming he was like a lamb among wolves. As early as autumn 1645 the perceptive Thomas Juxon commented that Fairfax was &#145;wax which as often as melted receives impression&#146;  (Juxon, 94). Clement Walker later dismissed him as someone &#145;fitter to follow another man's counsel than his own&#146;  (C. Walker, <span class="italic">The Compleat History of Independency</span>, 4 vols., 1660&#150;61, 1.29). Yet he knew his own mind well enough to present a petition to Charles I in 1642, and later to boycott the king's trial in 1649, the invasion of Scotland in 1650, and several royalist conspiracies prior to 1660.<br>
<br>The life of a warrior was Fairfax's first love. An excellent battlefield commander, he was not a distinguished military strategist. His greatest achievement was to weld the New Model Army into a supremely effective fighting force. The nadir of his life occurred between 1647 and 1649, when he was manipulated by men much shrewder than himself. His autobiographical attempt to excuse the political failings of these years does not command respect. Yet in 1659&#150;60 he chalked up his second most important achievement when he neutralized Lambert's army in Yorkshire, enabling Monck to march into England unopposed. One of the ironies of English history is that the man who as much as anyone was responsible for the ruin of Charles I was the same man who played an essential part in restoring that king's son to the throne.<br>
