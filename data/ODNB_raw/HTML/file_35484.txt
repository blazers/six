<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perring,  William George Arthur</span>  (1898&#150;1951), <span class="occ">aerodynamicist and government scientist</span>, was born on 16 December 1898 in Gillingham, Kent, the eldest son of John Richard Brooking Perring, a shipwright, and his wife, Alice Johns, both formerly of Devon. In 1913 he commenced a seven-year apprenticeship at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Chatham, after which he obtained a three-year scholarship from the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights to enter the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. In 1923 he gained a first-class professional certificate in naval architecture in his final examination, and was awarded an 1851 royal commission postgraduate scholarship for two years' research in the William Froude ship tank at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington, where his research under G. S. Baker included the application of airscrew vortex theory to ships' propellers. During this time he became a member of the Institution of Naval Architects, who published his paper &#145;Form effect and form resistance&#146;, and also of the North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders, who awarded him a &pound;7 prize for his paper &#145;The influence of the type of engine on the running cost of ships&#146;, read to the institution in the 1923&#150;4 session. After leaving the NPL he was briefly assistant to Sir George Hunter of Messrs Swan, Hunter, and Wigham Richardson in Newcastle upon Tyne, but with a depression in shipbuilding he turned to aviation and was appointed a junior scientific officer in the aerodynamics department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), Farnborough, in December 1925.<br>
<br>In 1926 Perring married Joyce Carver, eldest daughter of John Carver (1852&#150;1921), a seaman, and his wife, Alice Ann (1862&#150;1947). Their three children were born at 52 Manor Road, Farnborough: Kenneth in 1927, Jean in 1929, and Wendy in 1930. However, family life was tragically interrupted in 1933 when Joyce Perring died during a serious operation, and again in 1939 when his son died from an infected minor injury. That year he moved to Samarkand, Ashley Road, Farnborough, and in 1942 he married May Elizabeth Willstrop (1901&#150;1998), the widow of a former RAE metallurgist and friend, with one son, Roderick, later to become an astronomer at the Cambridge observatory. In 1949 they moved to Samarkand, Prior Road, Camberley.<br>
<br>From 1926 to 1930, under the leadership of G. P. Douglas, Perring carried out wind tunnel research at the RAE on numerous airfoil and prototype models, including research on multi-hinged flaps, induced drag from engine cooling systems, and high tip speed propellers, the latter particularly relevant to British Schneider Trophy seaplanes. In 1930 L. P. Coombes was transferred to Farnborough from the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe to equip and run the new seaplane tank. Perring was appointed his assistant, but was first sent to Felixstowe for six months to gain practical water handling experience on flying boats. The new seaplane tank differed radically from ship tanks, which had been used previously. The speed, acceleration, and braking of the carriage, and the wing lift of the models required new methods of forced balance measurement and damping, and before model testing could begin on the hydrodynamic forces and stability of flying boat hulls, considerable test work was necessary to establish the wall, depth, and scale effect of the new tank. During these years, Perring published thirty Air Ministry reports and memoranda, and &#145;The Farnborough seaplane tank&#146; in <span class="italic">Aircraft Engineering</span>, March 1934.<br>
<br>Perring returned to wind tunnel research in 1936, first on the 24 foot wind tunnel and later on the design and construction of the new high-speed tunnel, later renamed the 8 foot transonic tunnel. Many well-known scientists, including professors A. Thom, W. A. Mair, and A. R. Collar, and Sir Arnold Hall, later director of the RAE, were among the young scientists he recruited to the project. He was appointed superintendent of scientific research in 1940 and deputy director in 1941 following William Farren's appointment as director. In the wartime organization Farren initially looked after the electrical, armament, and instrument areas, leaving aerodynamics to Perring: work vital to improving the performance of allied aircraft and analysing the performance of enemy ones, including the reconstruction of a V 2 rocket from parts recovered when a prototype fell in Sweden. Some of this work was published in &#145;A critical review of German long-range rocket development&#146; and, with Thom, &#145;The design and work of the Farnborough high speed tunnel&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society</span>, 50 (1946) and 52 (1948) respectively. In 1946 Perring was appointed director of the RAE with John Serby as deputy director, to organize post-war research and development at Farnborough and to plan the new national aeronautical establishment at Bedford. From shipyard apprentice to director of a large government research establishment was a remarkable career achievement.<br>
<br>Slow of speech and slightly portly with ruddy complexion, Perring preferred to see specialist disciplines grouped together, with staff sharing experiences and able to move quickly from one problem to another, rather than placed in mixed discipline aircraft or missile departments. His prodigious workload and unfailing good humour were well known&#151;reports stacked in his office, work carried home in a battered old suitcase, reading and commenting quickly on all RAE reports of consequence, and writing in the evening to leave the following day free for meetings. Nevertheless, there was always time to discuss and encourage the work of young scientists and engineers, and he was actively involved with education at Cranfield Aeronautical College and the RAE Technical College. He was a member of the Aeronautical Research Committee and of the Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council, a member of council of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and was appointed CB in 1949.<br>
<br>This workload affected Perring's health and he died suddenly from a heart attack at his home in Camberley on 8 April 1951, aged fifty-two. He was buried in Ship Lane cemetery, Farnborough; a memorial service was held at Aldershot garrison church, at which addresses were given by Sir Archibald Rowlands and Sir Frederick Handley Page. The Royal Aeronautical Society posthumously awarded him their gold medal, but his early death denied him other civil honours he would undoubtedly have received. At the RAE a conference room was dedicated to his memory and the Perring memorial lecture was given in 1975 to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death.<br>
