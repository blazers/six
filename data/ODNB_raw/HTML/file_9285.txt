<span class="headword">Fennell,  James</span>  (1766&#150;1816), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London on 11 December 1766. His father, John Fennell, was in the treasury department of the navy pay office in London; his mother was a former Miss Brady. James went to school first at Bow under the Revd Dr French and then to Eton College. After a trip to France he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in Michaelmas 1784. His life at the university was extravagant. Having abandoned the idea of taking orders he entered Lincoln's Inn in November 1786. In consequence of gambling debts he mortgaged to his father the money to which he was entitled, and, when no further allowance could be obtained, in June 1787 went to Edinburgh with a view to becoming a professional actor. John Jackson, the manager of the Theatre Royal, engaged him as an amateur. His first appearance, under the name of Cambray (from the resemblance of his own name to that of F&eacute;nelon, archbishop of Cambrai), was as Othello. He played six times in Edinburgh with some success, and accepted an engagement for the following season. After returning to London, he appeared at Covent Garden on 12 October 1787 as Othello, and acted in other plays. Thomas Harris, the manager, offered to engage him and pay his forfeit to Jackson, but he returned to Edinburgh in time for the season of 1788 and worked diligently and conscientiously. Among his friends in Edinburgh were Henry Mackenzie, the author of <span class="italic">The Man of Feeling</span>, and John Home the author of <span class="italic">Douglas</span>. He lived for a while with James Bruce, an explorer of Africa, and claimed to have helped him to write his <span class="italic">Travels</span>. He was to play Jaffier in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, the part of Pierre having been assigned to an actor named Woods. A proposal that the parts should be exchanged led to a riot in the theatre and a bitter controversy; Fennell offered at one point to reveal a &#145;scene of villainy&#146;. Edinburgh lawyers took part against him, and addressed a letter to the manager (15 July 1788) signed by Henry Erskine (dean of faculty) and 182 advocates and writers. Fennell took legal action but ultimately agreed to a compromise, which involved payment to him of &pound;500. He was also invited to play once more at the theatre, and appeared accordingly as Othello.<br>
<br>Fennell gave one more performance in Edinburgh and then went to London, where he is said to have edited the <span class="italic">Theatrical Guardian</span>, of which six weekly numbers are believed to have appeared in London in March and April 1791. In August 1791 he played Othello at York under Tate Wilkinson. Soon afterwards, on his arrival in London, he was arrested for debt. He was still helped by his father, who with other members of his family had disowned him when he took to the stage. He then acted at Richmond, where he brought out his <span class="italic">Linda and Clara, or, The British Officer</span>, a comedy in three acts, subsequently enlarged to five, and published in 1791. While in London he pursued literary and scientific schemes. A trip to Paris in 1791 led to the publication of <span class="italic">A Review of the Proceedings at Paris during the Last Summer</span> in 1792. On 10 May 1792 he married Miss H. B. Porter, the third daughter of Dr Porter.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards (1793) Fennell accepted an offer from Thomas Wignell, the manager of the Philadelphia theatre, and started for America. In 1794 he was the idol of the literary youth of Philadelphia. Between 1797 and 1806 he acted at many theatres in New York, Boston, and elsewhere. He was popular and successful, and while his best role was thought to be Othello he played a wide range of tragic parts. He gave readings and recitations at the College Hall, Philadelphia, and for a time kept an academy at Charlestown, Massachusetts. In 1814 he established salt works near New London, Connecticut. He invested heavily and fell into debt, and was forced to resort to all sorts of work, including manual labour. He also tried to establish in Philadelphia a school similar to Eton or Westminster. He wrote some verse epistles, one of which was printed, and composed an <span class="italic">Apology</span> for his life (1814). In a pitiable preface he speaks of poverty, and of his &#145;drooping family&#146;. Fennell was a talented and remarkably handsome man, over 6 feet in height, with light complexion and hair, and light grey eyes. It was said that he never paid his bills in Paris or Philadelphia, that he lived by fraud, and passed his life between a palace and a prison. In 1815, at the Chesnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, he was allowed to attempt Lear, but his memory was gone. He died on 13 June 1816.<br>
