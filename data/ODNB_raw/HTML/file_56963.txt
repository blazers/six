<span class="headword">Hull <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Henderson]</span>,  Edith Maude</span>  (1880&#150;1947), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at 28 Marlborough Hill, London, on 16 August 1880, the only daughter of James Henderson (<i>b</i>. 1851/2), a Liverpool shipowner, and his Canadian wife, Katharine (Katie) Thorne, formerly Sancton (<i>b</i>. 1851/2). Little is known of Edith's early life, except that she made a visit to Algeria, most probably the inspiration for her novels set in north Africa, with a female friend. On 31 August 1899 she married Percy Winstanley Hull (1869&#150;1944), who was eleven years older than her. The couple lived in Stanwell, Middlesex, before settling in Hazelwood, Derbyshire, at The Knowle, the Hull family estate, and the second largest private home in the district  (Smith, 34). Percy's father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14111/', "William Winstanley Hull (1794&#150;1873)")</script>, liturgical writer and hymnologist; Percy became a gentleman farmer and a breeder of prize-winning pigs. While he was away serving in the First World War, Edith wrote her first novel, <span class="italic">The Sheik</span>, merely as a personal distraction from her isolation.<br>
<br>Published in 1919 under the author name E. M. Hull, <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> was an immediate <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i>, going through 108 British impressions before 1923. In America its huge popularity was fuelled by the Hollywood mogul Jesse Lasky's risky decision to make a film version using, in the lead role, the little-known Rudolph Valentino, who came to epitomize the male romantic lover. Eventually 125 million people saw the film, making it the most popular of the age (although it has been suggested that Hull did not reap the financial rewards of her book because of unfortunate contracts). <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> generated catch-phrases (such as &#145;Shriek for the sheik will seek you too&#146;) and popular songs, notably &#145;The Sheik of Araby&#146;; it gave a new connotation of seducer to the word &#145;sheik&#146;.<br>
<br>This first novel by a reticent, provincial Englishwoman had become not only a huge best-seller but also a cultural phenomenon, despite being reviled by the few reviewers who did not consider it altogether beneath their contempt: &#145;Poisonously salacious in conception&#146;, decried the <span class="italic">Literary Review</span> in a typical response  (quoted in Raub, 126). Yet it was salaciousness purveyed within the safe realm of romantic fantasy that accounts for the impact of <span class="italic">The Sheik</span>. On the surface the plot is rather flimsy: Diana Mayo, a cold but spirited young girl with a quality of boyishness, takes a month-long trek into the Sahara desert. On the second day she is captured by Arabs, and their sheikh, Ahmed Ben Hassan, transports her to his luxurious tent where he rapes her. For several weeks the sheikh forces himself on her, breaking her will, until her fear and hatred of him are swamped by passionate love. When a vile rival sheikh abducts her and attempts to assault her, Ahmed rescues her. Wounded in the effort and now realizing his love for her, Ahmed is so ashamed of his previous behaviour that he feels he must renounce Diana and return her to England. She implores him to let her stay with him, fails, and attempts to shoot herself. Ahmed deflects the bullet, and confesses his love, and the couple embrace as the novel closes. It is conveniently revealed that Ahmed is actually not an Arab but the son of a cruel English aristocrat and a Spanish woman, thus rendering the supposed sheikh a perfect matrimonial prospect.<br>
<br>This novel did not initiate the so-called desert romance, as some have claimed, but rather drew on the tradition of female nineteenth-century British travellers, and probably on the scandalous life of Jane Digby, a divorced aristocrat who married Sheikh Medjouel al-Mesrab  (Bettinotti and Truel, 186&#150;7). In fiction the most famous precedent was <span class="italic">The Garden of Allah</span> (1904) by the decadent novelist Robert Hichens, also a runaway best-seller. Elinor Glyn's <span class="italic">Three Weeks</span> (1907), which advocated that a &#145;woman will stand almost anything from a passionate lover&#146;, also provided a model for the seduction scenes. Hull's viewpoint is similar, but the originality of <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> lies in its merging of villain and hero in the figure of the sheikh and even more strikingly in the heroine's response to the villain's brutal caresses; Diana the victim becomes an equal sexual partner, and neither she nor her villain lover is punished for their extramarital liaison. <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> also subverts traditional romance, in that the passionate couple have no plan to marry or return to the safe, civilized world.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Sheik</span> spawned numerous imitations through the 1920s. Hull herself brought out a sequel, <span class="italic">Sons of the Sheik</span> (1925), also filmed with Rudolph Valentino, as well as a handful of other romances in the same vein, including <span class="italic">The Shadow of the East</span> (1921), <span class="italic">The Desert Healer</span> (1923), <span class="italic">The Lion Tamer</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">The Captive of Sahara</span> (1931). None of the others achieved the success of <span class="italic">The Sheik</span>; <span class="italic">Sons of the Sheik</span>, as the title suggests, follows the lives of Diana's and Ahmed Ben Hassan's less virile sons, and it plummets from melodrama into sentimentality.<br>
<br>Despite the popularity of her work, Hull shunned publicity. She frequently travelled abroad to America, India, and Europe, and was away from Derby when the film of <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> premiered there in 1923. In her <span class="italic">Camping in the Sahara</span> (1926) she recounts her voyage to Algeria in the early 1920s, which she undertook with her daughter and only child, Cecil Winstanley Hull (1902&#150;1981), who took the photographs illustrating the book. In it Edith conveys her admiration for the stern yet just leadership of the chieftains she encountered; the admiration was obviously reciprocated since she earned the title &#145;friend of the Arabs&#146;, which thrilled her. Cecil (so named because the Hulls had wanted a boy) was equally fearless on this rather daring journey. During the Second World War she served as an army colonel and later as chief commander of the Auxiliary Territorial Service stationed at Leicester; she was awarded an OBE. Edith herself took her part in the war, serving as local representative of the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association.<br>
<br>During her lifetime Hull's novels were translated into fourteen languages, but for reasons unknown she ceased publishing in 1939; her final novel was <span class="italic">The Forest of Terrible Things</span>. Eight years later, on 11 February 1947, she died after a short illness at her home, Holmeside, in Hazelwood, the town where she had quietly lived for most of her life. She was buried at Hazelwood church on 14 February 1947. E. M. Hull has been described as a modest, gentle, clever woman, and a hard-working professional author who guarded her privacy  (<span class="italic">Derbyshire Advertiser</span>). A photograph taken in her later years reveals a woman with a serious, even careworn expression, perhaps conveyed by hooded eyes behind rather severe wire-rimmed glasses. Her hair is pinned into a roll and her face is squarish, with just the suggestion of a dimple in her chin, and there is nothing in this glimpse of her that evokes the author of wildly popular, racy desert romances.<br>
<br>Despite their flaws, including purple prose and melodramatic plotting, Hull's novels have had a lasting power, as is evidenced by the recent reprint of five of them and a resurgence of critical interest in her. Feminist scholars such as Patricia Raub have argued that <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> can be seen as a precursor of the Harlequin romances which became popular in the late 1950s, with its portrayal of a woman who gains power over her love (Barbara Cartland, the queen of Harlequin romances, abridged several of Hull's novels). While contemporary audiences may find the sado-masochism, racism, and sexism of <span class="italic">The Sheik</span> unpalatable, Hull's open exploration of female desire from a woman's perspective, and her depiction of sexual experience as the basis for identity, can be seen within a wider context of liberalized sexuality.<br>
