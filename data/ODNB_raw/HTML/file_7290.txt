<span class="headword">Davis,  Lockyer John</span>  (1717&#150;1791), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was baptized at St Bartholomew-the-Great, London, on 14 November 1717, the son of James Davis, salesman of that parish, and his wife Elizabeth. His father was the eldest brother of the bookseller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7276/', "Charles Davis (bap. 1693, d. 1755)")</script>, to whom Lockyer was apprenticed on 1 August 1732, by which time James Davis had already died. Lockyer Davis was freed on 2 December 1746 and was elected to the livery of the Stationers' Company on the same day; from 1753 he was in business over against Gray's Inn Gate, in Holborn. Two years later he succeeded to his uncle's business, and from 1757 until 1768 he was in partnership with his first cousin Charles Reymers, son of his father's youngest sister, Elizabeth. On 9 November 1769, in her forty-eighth year, his wife, Mary, died; she was buried in St Bartholomew-the-Great. A year later Davis had moved his business to 326 High Holborn.<br>
<br>Like his uncle Davis bought and sold libraries, and he issued numerous catalogues, fifteen of which have survived. As a &#145;catalogist&#146; (one who &#145;distributes books at fixed prices for ready money&#146;) he is ranked by Nichols second only to Thomas Osborne  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.625). Davis was a member of the club of major booksellers that met monthly at the Shakespeare tavern, where, according to Nichols, &#145;the germ of many a valuable publication&#146; originated, including the ideas that led to the publication in 1779 of <span class="italic">The Works of the English Poets with Prefaces, Biographical and Critical, by Samuel Johnson</span>, in the imprint of which Davis's name appears  (ibid., 5.325). He had earlier been involved in the publication of various editions of Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> and <span class="italic">Plays of Shakespeare</span>.<br>
<br>Davis was bookseller and nominal printer to the Royal Society, and one of the nominal printers of the votes of the House of Commons. His wide knowledge of scholarship and books contributed to his becoming a consultant to many of the literary figures of the day. Fewer men &#145;knew more of books&#146;, Nichols observes, &#145;or more of the world; and fewer still were equally willing to advantage others by a free communication&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.436). The recognition of his integrity as a man and as a tradesman, coupled with his amiable manners, made him a sought-after social companion. Among the legacies of the printer William Bowyer the younger in 1777 was one of &pound;100 to Davis. He was a master of the Stationers' Company for 1779&#150;80 and an honorary registrar of the Literary Fund for the Relief of Distressed Authors, founded in 1790. He contributed light, occasional pieces to the newspapers, particularly the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, but his only acknowledged book, published in 1775 and again in 1781, was &#145;a new edition, revised and improved&#146; of <span class="italic">Maxims and Moral Reflections by the Duke de la Rochefoucault</span>. The 1775 edition contains a dedication, signed with the name Lockyer Davis, to David Garrick, &#145;whose various and inimitable representations display a knowledge of the human heart not inferior to that of Rochefoucault these maxims &hellip; are gratefully inscribed by one less ambitious of patronage than proud of his friendship&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Davis died suddenly at his house in Holborn on 23 April 1791, in his seventy-fourth year. He was buried in St Bartholomew-the-Great, where a tablet to the memory of Davis and his wife was placed under the organ loft.<br>
