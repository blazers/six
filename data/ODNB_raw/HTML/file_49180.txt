<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Isaacs,  Jacob</span>  (1896&#150;1973), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born in London on 6 December 1896, the son of the Revd Moses David Isaacs and his wife, Jessie, daughter of the Revd Moses Bregman. Isaacs's parents were Orthodox Jews, and he was brought up in the largely Jewish East End of London and educated at the Grocers' Company's School, Hackney Downs. In 1912 Isaacs joined the civil service where he worked until 1916. From 1916 Isaacs was on active service in France as a lieutenant (Territorial Army) in the Royal Garrison Artillery. After the 1918 armistice he became area commandant and brigade education officer. Of this period of active service, &#145;G. H.&#146;, writing in <span class="italic">The Times</span> after Isaacs's death, recalled that his &#145;talk and clowning as a young officer on the Western front solaced many a suffering fellow intellectual&#146;  (17 May 1973, 21h).<br>
<br>On 29 April 1919 Isaacs matriculated as a commoner reading English at Exeter College, Oxford. As there were very few fellows at his college at the time, he was assigned an outside tutor, Herbert Francis Brett-Smith. He seems not to have participated in the sporting activities at Exeter College. In March 1921 Isaacs was proposed as a member of the college Essay Club (the subjects ranging from Sappho to Shakespeare), was elected, and attended the meeting of 18 May 1921. He received a first-class honours degree in English language and literature, and took his BA degree on 3 November 1921. His examiners were Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Arthur Quiller Couch, Professor R. W. Chambers, and the historian of the English language Professor H. C. Wyld. On 11 June 1927 Isaacs received his MA degree from Oxford University.<br>
<br>In 1921 Isaacs was appointed assistant lecturer in English at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he worked under Professor Herbert G. Wright. In 1924 Isaacs became assistant lecturer in English at King's College, University of London, and in 1928 he was promoted to lecturer. &#145;G. H.&#146; recalled in <span class="italic">The Times</span> that &#145;Oxford and London in the twenties knew him as a redoubtable controversialist in almost all the arts&#146;  (17 May 1973, 21h). On 15 July 1933 he married the non-Jewish Enid Austin Dickie (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), librarian, daughter of George Austin Dickie, architect; they had two daughters. In his dedication to <span class="italic">An Assessment of Twentieth-Century Literature</span> (1951) Isaacs wrote that his wife &#145;comforted me with apples and stayed me with flagons&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1938, at the invitation of the Sir Moses Montefiore Commemoration Committee, Isaacs gave a highly successful series of twelve public lectures at the Mount Scopus campus of the fledgeling Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Palestine. In 1942 Isaacs was appointed the first Montefiore professor of English in the university, and he set about organizing and heading the new English department. At the end of 1945 Isaacs, his wife, and his family returned to England. Seven years later he was appointed to the chair of English language and literature at Queen Mary College, University of London. He gave his inaugural lecture, &#145;The nature of literary history&#146;, on 20 May 1952. Following a series of depressions Isaacs retired from the chair and in 1964 was appointed professor emeritus.<br>
<br>Isaacs's productivity ranged from critical exegesis to the textual editing of plays. He was author or editor of more than thirty books and articles, his field of concentration ranging from Shakespeare and his contemporaries, with a particular focus on Elizabethan and Restoration theatrical history, to Sir George Etherege, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and twentieth-century poetry. Isaacs's strength lay in the lengthy article rather than the full-length monograph. His <span class="italic">Coleridge's Critical Terminology</span>, published as an English Association pamphlet in 1936, revealed a fine understanding both of critical theory and of Coleridge's critical importance. Isaacs's knowledge of bibliography and theatrical history was exhibited in, for instance, his <span class="italic">Production and Stage-Management at the Blackfriars Theatre</span>, a Shakespeare Association pamphlet of 1935. Professor C. L. Wrenn, with whom Isaacs worked at King's College, described Isaacs in a June 1945 testimonial as &#145;brilliant&#146;, noting that this was a quality &#145;especially displayed in [his] lectures &hellip; In King's College students of all faculties used to crowd into Mr. Isaacs' lectures as the most stimulating to minds of every kind.&#146; Some of this brilliance was revealed in Isaacs's pioneering six BBC Third Programme broadcast lectures in 1949, published under the title <span class="italic">The Background of Modern Poetry</span> in 1951 and appealing to a wide rather than to a university-restricted audience. The talks were marked by clarity and scholarship and interlaced with wit, humour, irony, and choice poetic citation. Isaacs clearly revealed his bias as &#145;a literary historian&#146; with &#145;the historical point of view&#146;  (Isaacs, <span class="italic">Modern Poetry</span>, 92). Demonstrating the range of his vision and taste, he concluded with citations from the poetry of Wallace Stevens and the Anglo-Jewish poet Lazarus Aaronson, and from the criticism of his friend T. S. Eliot.<br>
<br>Six lectures broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in September and October 1950 formed the foundation for Isaacs's <span class="italic">An Assessment of Twentieth-Century Literature</span> (1951). Isaacs's subjects ranged from the first forty years of the twentieth century, to scrutiny of &#145;the puzzling decade of the &#147;forties&#148;&#146;  (Isaacs, <span class="italic">Twentieth-Century Literature</span>, 41). A whole talk is devoted to &#145;T. S. Eliot and poetic drama&#146;. Isaacs's religious Jewish upbringing and knowledge were reflected in a series of 1966 BBC Third Programme radio talks on the influence of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> on English literature, English translations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, the Jew in English literature, and the Jewish contribution to art. Isaacs's eclecticism is reflected in the range of his publications. For instance 1954 saw the publication or reprinting of his &#145;Sixteenth century Bible versions&#146; and &#145;The Authorised Version and after&#146; in <span class="italic">The Bible in its Ancient and English Versions</span>; &#145;Dramatic criticism&#146;, an article in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>; radio broadcasts entitled &#145;Robert Frost at eighty&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>; and a broadcast entitled &#145;The art of Peter Paul Rubens&#146; for <span class="italic">London Calling</span> of the BBC overseas service. Also in 1954 he gave the British Academy Shakespeare lecture, &#145;Shakespeare's earliest years in the theatre&#146;, and a lecture entitled &#145;The academy labyrinth&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Art News and Review</span> (1954), and introduced a broadcast discussion between Robert Frost and R. Cook on Thoreau's <span class="italic">Walden</span>, published in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>.<br>
<br>Among Isaacs's other myriad interests was film criticism: he was a member of the London-based Film Society &#145;for which throughout the 1930s he edited, and wrote the bulk of, the unsigned programme notes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 May 1973, 20h). In a letter to Isaacs's widow on his death, R. P. Tong, the registrar and secretary of Queen Mary College, referred to Isaacs's &#145;wit and humour&#146;, and particularly remembered Isaacs for the &#145;common interest in wines&#146; which they shared. A fuller flavour of Isaacs's personality was revealed in the memorial reminiscences in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of &#145;G. H.&#146;, who noted that Isaacs:<blockquote>was for ever compiling material for what must surely prove one of the biggest and best books never written on the history of taste. Devastating as a critic, hardly ever known (and even less frequently proved) to be wrong, he went to inordinate length to help genuine students &hellip; he gave always much more than he took.</blockquote>He concluded, &#145;the jovial, genial giant with his quietly patient corrective voice, wrongly deemed supercilious by strangers, has gone from us, leaving us the poorer for his going&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 May 1973, 21h). Lord Bernstein and Ivor Montague, in a <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary notice, referred to Isaacs as among the &#145;jovial sardonics&#146;  (19 May 1973, 16h). During a lengthy period of confinement to his home, Little Court, Court Yard, Eltham, London, and bed, suffering from depression, Isaacs was looked after by his beloved wife. Isaacs died at Lewisham Hospital on 12 May 1973.<br>
