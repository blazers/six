<span class="headword">Purvis,  Arthur Blaikie</span>  (1890&#150;1941), <span class="occ">industrialist and buyer of war supplies</span>, was born in London on 31 March 1890, the son of William Blaikie Purvis, a commercial clerk, of Perth, Scotland, and his wife, Annie Maria Baker. He was educated at Tottenham grammar school and won a scholarship, but owing to the death of his father began work at thirteen. In 1905 he joined the firm of Lynch Brothers in London, and in 1910 went to Glasgow to the Nobel Explosives Company Ltd, where his ability was quickly recognized by Harry Duncan McGowan. He represented the firm in South America and South Africa and, despite his youth, by 1914 was in charge of the New York office. On the outbreak of war he made one of the largest war purchases, $25 million of acetone, which was in acute shortage in the United Kingdom; he remained responsible for the purchase in America of materials for explosives throughout the war. In 1918 he married Margaret, daughter of Cyrus Emory Jones, of Jamestown, New York; they had one son.<br>
<br>The strain of Purvis's wartime duties resulted in a prolonged breakdown in health. He went to the Adirondacks where, by sheer will-power, he made a recovery so complete that in 1925 he was able to go to Canada as president of Canadian Explosives Ltd, which he reorganized into Canadian Industries Ltd. He was eager to encourage chemical research in its application to Canada's natural resources and urged manufacturers to take risks in the adoption of scientific ideas. By 1939 he had become one of the foremost figures in Canadian industry and director of eleven important Canadian concerns. During these years he also devoted much time to community work, especially in Montreal where he was a governor of McGill University; as the remarkably successful chairman of the national employment commission (1936&#150;8), he also contributed services of a national character.<br>
<br>&#145;A man of the highest integrity with no enemies and, indeed, no critics&#146;, as the governor-general of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, described him, Purvis became director-general of British purchasing in the United States in November 1939, and in the following January chairman of the Anglo-French purchasing board &#145;with a high degree of effective authority&#146;, which on the British side did not, however, at first extend beyond making contracts for the Ministry of Supply. Purvis soon found his work hampered by the &#145;uncontrolled&#146; purchases of other missions, which, as he pointed out, &#145;destroyed his background&#146; with American industry and the United States government. Not until mid-1940 did he succeed in extending his own direct responsibility for purchase to machine tools and iron and steel, or in receiving, as of right, complete and detailed information from all other purchasing bodies.<br>
<br>From the outset, however, all doors in Washington were thrown open to Purvis. He conceived his task as far wider than the mere purchase of American supplies. He entered at once with President Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau, secretary of the United States treasury, into the economic planning of the war and the denial of supplies, especially of strategic metals, to the enemy. &#145;From the first&#146;, said Morgenthau, &#145;Purvis impressed me tremendously.&#146; It was essential, he counselled Purvis, to have a complete statement of all allied requirements lest they be swept aside when a still neutral United States turned to war expansion on its own account. Purvis, in his persuasive turn, pressed this lesson upon a British government not yet imaginatively ready, as Purvis was himself, to &#145;talk big&#146;, or, to Purvis, big enough.<br>
<br>It was Purvis who took immediate action in Washington during the fall of France, initially by negotiating the swift transfer of American arms to replace in part those lost by the British at Dunkirk. In one week he signed both the $37.5 million contract for this transaction and, on 17 June 1940, a document committing the British government to the payment of $600 million for the French contracts in America. &#145;Never&#146;, said Lord Woolton in the House of Lords a month later, &#145;have wider powers to commit this country been delegated to any mission.&#146;<br>
<br>In the next six months Purvis played the leading part in carrying through the decision to empty the British war chest by both financing massive British war contracts in the United States and, by a series of capital investments, laying the foundations of the American munitions industry. In July 1940 he was joined in Washington by M. Jean Monnet, who, like himself, recognized the vital importance of the British striking a proper balance between their own competing claims. Without explicit authority Purvis set about the necessary co-ordination at a time when there were a number of separate British missions in the United States, some <i>ad hoc</i> and some representing different departments in Whitehall; of these the air commission was especially independent. Until December 1940 Purvis achieved such co-ordination as was attained by his personal efforts and persuasion and the especial confidence of Morgenthau. After visiting the United Kingdom in the closing weeks of that year for discussions on the strategy of British supply in the United States, on his return Purvis was given explicit status by his appointment as chairman of the British supply council in North America and thus, on the civilian side, director of the entire British war organization there.<br>
<br>If his authority was now assured, to Purvis the basic issue remained unchanged: &#145;it was a cardinal feature of the Purvis&#150;Monnet programme to get the Americans to raise their sights all round&#146;. The president resumed with Purvis the discussions which had already borne fruit in the idea of the <span class="roman">Lend-Lease Bill</span> and were now shaping the range and scope of the act. Purvis now went into action with &#145;a well-tried weapon from Monnet's armoury&#146;, the balance sheet technique. Largely on his own initiative, in January 1941 he boldly translated into dollars British requirements which he had gathered from departments in Whitehall, and produced his estimate of British production and of the resultant deficiency which American production could alone make good. The president took his estimate of $15 billion, Purvis reported, in his stride. It was held in official circles at the time that Purvis's balance sheet powerfully influenced the first appropriation under the <span class="roman">Lend-Lease Act</span>. British policy in Washington at this period &#145;formulated in large measure by Monnet's planning mind and propagated by the persistence and persuasiveness of Purvis&#146; was making demands on American industry greatly in advance of contemporary American opinion. Purvis himself was by now the most powerful British influence in the United States. To Morgenthau he was not only &#145;the ablest British representative in Washington but one of the rarest persons I have ever known&#146;. He was nominated to the privy council in December 1940 but did not live to be sworn.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Purvis was planning to secure from President Roosevelt the greatest directive yet issued, to place all American production on a full war basis. He was killed when the aircraft in which he was returning from Britain to Washington crashed on taking off from Prestwick on 14 August 1941. &#145;Purvis was a grievous loss&#146;, wrote Winston Churchill  (<span class="italic">Second World War</span>, 3, 1950), &#145;as he held so many British, American, and Canadian threads in his hands, and had hitherto been the directing mind in their harmonious combination.&#146; The Anglo-American consolidated statement that month represented the climax of Purvis's work and the effective beginning of that Victory programme which thereafter took the central place in the wartime economic planning of the Western allies. Purvis saw&#151;was perhaps the first to see&#151;the size of the problem.<br>
