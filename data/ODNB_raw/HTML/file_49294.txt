<span class="headword">Fergusson,  William</span>  (1795?&#150;1846), <span class="occ">physician and colonial governor</span>, was born in Jamaica, the son of a Scottish father and a mother of African descent. His date of birth is derived from a tablet erected in his memory in Jamaica, which gives his age at death as fifty-one. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University (1809&#150;12), became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Scotland (1813), and was commissioned in the army with the rank of hospital assistant. On the recommendation of the African Association, an anti-slavery pressure group concerned with advancing people of African descent, he was posted to Sierra Leone and appointed second surgeon to the colony. In 1816 he returned to Scotland to settle a disputed Jamaican bankruptcy case, and on 23 November 1818 he married Charlotte Hall, the daughter of a Musselburgh merchant. Their daughter, Anne, was the mother of the painter William Fergusson Brassey Hole. The bankruptcy case dragged on, and it was 1824 before he rejoined the army on full pay with the rank of assistant surgeon in the Royal African Colonial Corps. In 1825 he was promoted staff surgeon.<br>
<br>Fergusson was also appointed one of the colonial surgeons with responsibilities in the Liberated African department, which looked after recaptives&#151;those rescued from slave ships by the navy, and liberated by the courts in Freetown. Eventually the army authorities objected to his combining military and civil duties, but for another two years, particularly during a disastrous yellow fever epidemic in 1829, he went on working without civilian pay. Although he had been appointed on the assumption that his Caribbean origin would protect him from tropical diseases, from his first arrival he suffered regular attacks of malaria. When, in 1830, he returned in medical charge of an invalid governor, he was allowed to stay on in Scotland to restore his health, his years of service having &#145;nearly made a wreck of my constitution&#146;.<br>
<br>From the start Fergusson endeared himself to the inhabitants of Freetown: when he went on leave in 1816 they presented him with a testimonial (the first ever offered by the community). As he put it, &#145;in my colour I possess a passport to their confidence&#146;  (Fergusson to Colonial Office, 18 Sept 1822, TNA: PRO, CO 267/57). When, in 1839, he was promoted staff surgeon, first class (equivalent to lieutenant-colonel), Governor Doherty recommended him as a member of the governor's council (the legislative body for the colony) from &#145;his great experience in the Colony and intimate knowledge of its inhabitants, as well as the confidence of all classes of the population which he largely possesses&#146;  (Doherty to Colonial Office, 30 Aug 1840, TNA: PRO, CO 267/159). Moreover, his commanding presence&#151;tall, handsome, and dignified, but offset by an informal, easy manner&#151;disarmed prejudice attached to his colour. He was commissioned to act in a vacancy as lieutenant-governor, and took over the post in 1841. Simultaneously John Carr, from Trinidad, was appointed chief justice. Thus the two highest posts in the colony were held by men of part-African descent. In 1844 Fergusson acted as lieutenant-governor again, and in 1845 was commissioned as captain-general and governor-in-chief&#151;the first, and last, governor of a British African colony of African descent.<br>
<br>Colonial policy at this period concentrated on supplying labour to replace the slave labour which emancipation had ended in the Caribbean. Sierra Leone, long seen as a useless drain on public money, seemed a possible source, if the Liberated African department could be abolished, and the inhabitants encouraged to emigrate. Fergusson had to implement this policy. In well-informed dispatches, based on his long experience, he explained that, while the slave trade persisted, recaptives would still have to be maintained, and that the settled population had no interest in the Caribbean. Instead they were, on their own initiative, now emigrating back to their homelands in the Yoruba country (modern Nigeria), taking with them the &#145;Christianity and Civilization&#146; the colony had been founded to promote. Fergusson had already, in <span class="italic">A Letter to Thomas Fowell Buxton, Esq.</span>, published in 1839, displayed a very positive picture of the recaptive population. Having arrived &#145;emaciated, squalid, naked&#146; from the slave ships, they were now &#145;well clad, well housed, independent, quiet, orderly and respectable members of society&#146;, stratified into classes, headed by a growing, prosperous bourgeoisie, and maintained by a flourishing import/export trade. This was very different from the customary negative picture of Sierra Leone. The Colonial Office officials were impressed by Fergusson's obvious knowledge, and began to see Sierra Leone in a more positive way, as did the Church Missionary Society, with which Fergusson was closely concerned, which began investing substantially in education. It was the beginning of a period of nearly forty years of economic and social prosperity.<br>
<br>Forward-looking, Fergusson wanted the colony to expand. He made treaties with neighbouring chiefs and sent a mission to Futa Jalon (modern Guinea) financed by the mercantile community, including, as he proudly reported, some wealthy recaptives. But liver and digestive complaints had undermined his health. He was forced to leave the colony for treatment, and died at sea, on the barque <i>Funchal</i>, on 19 January 1846. A tablet to his memory was erected in St George's Cathedral, Freetown, by public subscription. His daughter Anne (<i>d</i>. 1891) was the mother of the Scottish historian William Hole (1846&#150;1917).<br>
