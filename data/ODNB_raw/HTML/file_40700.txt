</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wynne,  Greville Maynard</span>  (1919&#150;1990), <span class="occ">businessman and spy</span>, was born on 19 March 1919 in Wrockwardine Wood, east of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, the only son to grow up of Ethelbert Wynne, plater, and his wife, Ada Pritchard. He had three elder sisters; an elder brother had died aged one in 1915. He was brought up at Ystradmynach, a mining village 12 miles north of Cardiff, where his father was a foreman in an engineering works. His mother died when he was fourteen. He worked in his middle teens as an electrician, and took evening courses in engineering at Nottingham University.<br>
<br>Called up into the army in 1939, Wynne spent the Second World War as a sergeant in the field security police, looking after elementary security in various parts of Great Britain. He acquired the vocabulary of the intelligence corps, in which he served. On being demobilized in 1946 he married, on 21 September at St Anne's, Wandsworth, Sheila Margaret, daughter of Gordon Beaton, chemist. They had a son.<br>
<br>Wynne already described himself, on his marriage certificate, as a consulting engineer&#151;a trade in which he made himself useful to exporters, with whom lay the country's best hope of staying solvent. In a decade and a half he built up a profitable small business, and came to specialize in assisting exports to eastern Europe, then under rigid communist control from Moscow. He occasionally visited the USSR to forward his clients' interests. He was a short, stocky man, with a brisk, cheerful manner, a toothbrush moustache, and smooth dark hair.<br>
<br>As a matter of routine MI6 (the Secret Intelligence Service) briefed many British businessmen who travelled behind the iron curtain about points for which they might like to look out while there; Wynne was among them. Chance turned him into an important pawn in the &#145;great game&#146;. Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel in Russian secret military intelligence, had been demoted from work he enjoyed in Turkey to run a Moscow committee that enquired into scientific matters&#151;a cover for industrial espionage against the capitalist powers. Entirely disillusioned with the Soviet regime, Penkovsky sought to change sides, and through several intermediaries approached the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), without securing a response. He then approached Wynne, who informed MI6, which decided to take the case up, and to handle it jointly with the CIA. MI6 accepted Wynne as one of the conduits through which material could from time to time be passed to and from Penkovsky.<br>
<br>Some of this material was of world strategic importance, for it enabled the Americans to outface the Russians in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Shortly thereafter Wynne, who may have shown unprofessional enthusiasm at finding himself in Penkovsky's presence, unaware of the strictness with which Soviet citizens kept watch on each other, was abruptly arrested in Budapest on 2 November 1962. He discovered after he had been flown to Moscow that Penkovsky was already in gaol. After nine months' intermittent, fierce interrogation, the two were given a public show trial there on 7&#150;11 May 1963.<br>
<br>Wynne stuck to his cover story that he was a simple businessman, admitting to having carried packets, but denying any knowledge of their contents. Penkovsky was sentenced to death, Wynne to eight years. After less than a year of hideous discomfort at Vladimir, some 120 miles east of Moscow, Wynne was, again abruptly, flown to Berlin and exchanged for a leading Soviet agent, Conon Molody (Gordon Lonsdale), early on 22 April 1964. The exchange received a torrent of publicity in the Western news media. MI6 and the CIA paid Wynne more than $200,000 compensation.<br>
<br>Wynne's wife had stood by him loyally; but his marriage swiftly broke up. He went off to Majorca with his secretary, Johanna Hermania, the daughter of Dirk van Buren, a civil servant. They married on 31 July 1970 at Kensington register office; his first wife had divorced him in 1968. There were no children of the second marriage. Wynne wrote two books, to try to make money out of what had happened to him: <span class="italic">The Man from Moscow</span>, a life of Penkovsky and himself (1967), and the much more fanciful <span class="italic">The Man from Odessa</span> (1981), in which, for example, he claimed to have held an army commission, which he never did. He never went back to business, lived latterly in Spain, and died of cancer in the Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, on 27 February 1990. A memorial service was held in Chelsea Old Church, London, on 5 May 1990.<br>
