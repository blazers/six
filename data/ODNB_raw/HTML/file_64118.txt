<span class="headword">Jolliffe,  William</span>  (1745&#150;1802), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 16 April 1745, the first son of John Jolliffe (<i>c</i>.1697&#150;1771), politician, of Petersfield, Hampshire, and Mary, daughter of Samuel Holden of Roehampton, Surrey. He was educated at Winchester College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating in 1764. In 1768 he was returned to parliament for Petersfield, a borough controlled by his father, and to which he succeeded as patron in 1771 on his father's death. On 28 August 1769 Jolliffe married Eleanor, the daughter of Sir Richard Hylton, fifth baronet, of Hayton Castle, Cumberland, and Eleanor Hedworth, with whom he had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In his early years in parliament Jolliffe generally supported the ministry of the day, first that led by the duke of Grafton and then Lord North's long ministry of 1770 to 1782. In February 1772 he was rewarded with a position on the Board of Trade, a post which he held until he resigned in 1779, &#145;in order to oblige Government&#146;  (Jolliffe, 55) by making room for Edward Gibbon. When North's ministry fell in 1782, Jolliffe remained faithful to him in opposition and went on to support the Fox&#150;North coalition ministry in 1783, during which he was a lord of the Admiralty. After the Fox&#150;North coalition was turned out, he persisted in his support for its leaders in opposition. By 1790, having fallen out with his constituents at Petersfield, Jolliffe had demolished his father's house there and moved to Merstham, Surrey, although he maintained his electoral interest at Petersfield. In 1791 he was sentenced to six months in prison and fined for allegedly trying to influence a jury. He regarded his conviction as a consequence of his continued support for North through the 1780s. Eventually the sentence was commuted to a fine only. In 1794 he followed, albeit warily, his new political master, the duke of Portland, when the Portland whigs went over to Pitt, but a rumoured peerage never materialized. On the whole he was to be a supporter of Pitt's ministry in the 1790s, although he did complain of &#145;Pitt's monstrous injustice&#146;  (Thorne, 321) in blocking his peerage and was critical of the ministry's policy in relation to France. By 1801 he can be regarded as in opposition. Jolliffe died at Merstham on 20 February 1802, having broken his neck falling through the trapdoor of his wine cellar.<br>
