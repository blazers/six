<span class="headword">Holmes,  Robert</span>  (1765&#150;1859), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of Hugh Holmes, a miller from Belfast. He was taught at a school in Belfast, where the family was living, and was then sent to a public school. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 4 November 1782, and graduated BA in 1787. Despite an early interest in medicine, he was called to the bar in 1795. In the same year he married Mary Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Emmet, the sister of Robert Emmet. They had one child before Mary died, allegedly of a brain fever after hearing of her brother's execution in 1803.<br>
<br>Holmes was an opponent of the union, and in 1798 he withdrew his membership of the lawyer corps of yeomanry. He feared that the placing of the corps under the military authorities might result in violence towards civilians. He was imprisoned for three months for having challenged a barrister who made imputations of cowardice against him. In 1799 he published a satirical pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Demonstration of the Necessity of the Legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland</span>, and he was imprisoned for some months after the rising of his brother-in-law, Robert Emmet, on 23 July 1803. Despite the fact that he had had no connection with the rebellion his association with radicalism and scandal slowed his professional progress.<br>
<br>Holmes declined to receive any favours from the government, refusing in succession the offices of crown prosecutor, king's counsel, and solicitor-general; he never took silk, not wanting to receive a compliment through William Plunket, who had led the prosecution against Emmet. Despite his refusal to accept favours from the government, his was for many years the largest practice of any member of the Irish courts. He was renowned as a fine lawyer and his arguments were always learned. He was a powerful and impressive advocate, and several of his speeches to juries&#151;particularly his speeches in <i>Watson v. Dill</i>, in defence of the <span class="italic">Nation</span> newspaper, and his oration on behalf of John Mitchel, tried for treason-felony on 24 May 1848&#151;earned him a good deal of professional respect. During the course of his practice he was said to have made over &pound;100,000. Nor did he refrain from continuing to write about his political opinions on Ireland: he published <span class="italic">An Address to the Yeomanry of Ireland, Demonstrating the Necessity of their Declaring their Opinions upon Political Subjects</span> and in 1847 <span class="italic">The Case of Ireland Stated</span>, on the repeal of the union. When old age prevented his continuing on circuit, the members of the north-east bar presented him with an address and presented a bust to the bar mess-room. Holmes retired formally in 1852, choosing to live in London with his only child, Elizabeth, who had married George William Lenox-Conyngham, chief clerk of the Foreign Office. Holmes died at 37 Eaton Place, Belgrave Square, London, on 30 November 1859.<br>
