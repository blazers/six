<span class="headword">Ommanney, Sir  John Acworth</span>  (1773&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, eldest son of Rear-Admiral Cornthwaite Ommanney (<i>d</i>. 1801), entered the navy in 1786 on board the frigate <i>Rose</i> (Captain Henry Harvey) on the Newfoundland station. He afterwards served from 1788 to 1792 in the Mediterranean, and in July 1792 was appointed to the <i>Lion</i> (Sir Erasmus Gower), which took Lord Macartney to China. On 20 May 1793 Ommanney was promoted lieutenant, and, on returning to England in October 1794, he was appointed to the frigate <i>Aquilon</i>, cruising in the channel. In March 1795 he was moved into the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, one of the ships with Lord Bridport in the engagement off Lorient on 23 June. On 6 December 1796 he was promoted commander. During the mutiny at the Nore he commanded gun-brig no. 28 for the defence of the Thames, and in December 1797 was appointed to the brig <i>Busy</i> in the North Sea, with considerable success. In August 1799, in company with the brig <i>Speedwell</i>, he stopped a fleet of Swedish merchant ships under the convoy of a frigate. Ommanney had intelligence that some of these ships were laden with contraband of war and were bound for French ports, and, as the frigate refused to allow them to be searched, he sent the whole fleet into the Downs, off the Kent coast, for examination. His tact and determination received the particular approval of the Admiralty.<br>
<br>In January 1800 Ommanney went to the West Indies, but was obliged by the state of his health to return in July. On 16 October he was advanced to post rank, and during 1801 commanded, in rapid succession, the frigate <i>Hussar</i>, the <i>Robust</i>, and the <i>Barfleur</i>, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Collingwood, in the Channel Fleet. Ommanney married, in October 1803, Frances, daughter of Richard Ayling, of Slidham, in Sussex; they had four daughters. From 1804 to 1806 he was flag captain to Sir Erasmus Gower on the Newfoundland station. He did not serve at sea again for nineteen years, a period that can be explained only by his whig politics. In 1825 he was appointed to the <i>Albion</i>, which, after some time at Lisbon, joined Sir Edward Codrington in the Mediterranean and had an important part in the battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827. Ommanney received the CB and French, Russian, and Greek decorations for this service.<br>
<br>On 22 July 1830 Ommanney was promoted rear-admiral; he was knighted on 23 May 1835, and nominated a KCB on 20 July 1838. From 1837 to 1840, with his flag in the <i>Donegal</i>, he had command of the Lisbon station, and from September 1840 to October 1841 he commanded at Malta, during the prolonged absence of the commander-in-chief, Sir Robert Stopford. He became a vice-admiral on 23 November 1841, and admiral on 4 May 1849. He was commander-in-chief at Devonport from 1851 to 1854, during the latter part of which time the fitting out of the fleet for the Baltic put severe strain on nerves enfeebled by age. He died at Warblington House, Havant, Hampshire, on 8 July 1855. Lady Ommanney died a few weeks after her husband, on 17 August. Sir Francis Molyneux Ommanney, the navy agent and MP for Barnstaple, who acted as banker and agent for Lord Collingwood, was Ommanney's brother.<br>
<br>Politically, Ommanney was closely linked to Palmerston, and through him to Lord Minto and Sir Charles Adam, a fact of some significance during his service at Lisbon and in the Syrian crisis of 1840. Palmerston thought highly of his good sense, and valued his political support in Portsmouth.<br>
