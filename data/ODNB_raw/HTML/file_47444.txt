<span class="headword">Bogue,  David</span>  (1807/8&#150;1856), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, was probably born and raised in Scotland. He worked as an assistant to the Edinburgh bookseller Thomas Ireland before moving to London in 1836. He then entered the shop of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47455/', "Charles Tilt (1797&#150;1861)")</script>, publisher and bookseller, at 86 Fleet Street. The corner shopfront had large multi-paned windows in which Tilt could display his stock of illustrated works. He &#145;had a genius for making money&#146;  (Vizetelly, 1.108). He imported French lithographic sheets that yielded over &pound;100 a week and also published and sold children's books, reprints of novels, and scrapbooks and annuals embellished with steel engravings. After the stamp duty on almanacs was repealed in 1834, Tilt did a thriving trade in all sorts of almanacs, including one that would fit into a top hat  (Browning, 296). He was a principal publisher of George Cruikshank's works&#151;several short-lived periodicals, brief illustrated stories, and the <span class="italic">Comic Almanack</span> (1835&#150;53), which began bravely with a circulation of 20,000 but lost customers to <span class="italic">Punch's Almanack</span> and other rivals by the late 1840s.<br>
<br>In 1840 Tilt, passing over his three senior employees, invited the youngest and newest clerk to join him as partner for a limited period, and then to buy him out. Bogue, a &#145;kindly and tolerant&#146; man  (Patten, 2.151), was flabbergasted to receive the offer, but he none the less accepted and devoted himself even more concertedly to justifying Tilt's faith in him. Three years later Tilt decided that the substantial assets he had amassed allowed him to retire from business and to travel. Bogue was able to purchase the firm for approximately &pound;50,000 because Tilt made generous provisions for the long-term buy-out of his interest. Within a few years Bogue also bought shares in the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>. He married and had five children, including a son, David, who went into publishing as well, although he did not thrive, took bankruptcy in 1885, and was found dead on the beach at Folkestone in 1897.<br>
<br>Bogue initiated a <span class="roman">European Library</span> of classics reprinted in an inexpensive format and sold for 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a volume; in it he published historical biographies by Alexandre Dumas and John Galt, among others, and works by Fran&ccedil;ois Mignet, William Hazlitt, and Jules Michelet. The success of this enterprise prompted Henry Bohn, who dealt on a large scale with remainders and inexpensive series, to set up a rival <span class="roman">Standard Library</span> collection in 1846. Among other purchases Bohn bought up the stock of an illustrated book on Lorenzo de' Medici; at that time copyright in illustrations travelled with the owner of the copyright in the book for which the plates were supplied. When Bogue reprinted these illustrations in William Roscoe's <span class="italic">Life of Lorenzo de' Medici</span>, Bohn sued. Bogue lost in the court of chancery, and within a few years Bohn purchased Bogue's <span class="roman">European Library</span>, folding it into the <span class="roman">Standard Library</span>, which eventually reached 150 titles.<br>
<br>Bogue's fortunes declined after the mid-1840s. Although one of his assets was Cruikshank, their various publishing ventures failed. The graphic temperance series <span class="italic">The Bottle</span> (1847) was &#145;a positive flop&#146;  (Cruikshank to C. P. Pitt, Patten, 2.251); so was its sequel, <span class="italic">The Drunkard's Children</span> (1848), whose failure led Cruikshank to lament to his publisher &#145;that England is not California&#146;, then in the grip of gold-rush fever  (ibid., 2.269). No more successful were comic novels written by Henry and Augustus Mayhew and illustrated by Cruikshank, including <span class="italic">1851</span>, a story intended to capitalize on the Great Exhibition. Bogue experimented with multi-volume compendia (<span class="italic">Comic Natural History</span>, 17 vols., <span class="italic">Manuals of Utility</span>, 8 vols., and <span class="italic">Books for the Race, Road and Fireside</span>, all 1847), and <span class="italic">Traveller's Guides</span> (to Belgium and the Rhine, Paris and its environs, Switzerland and Savoy, as well as the <span class="italic">Traveller's Dictionary</span>, 1852&#150;3). Bogue, who wrote children's stories anonymously, expanded the list of publications for the nursery: for example, eight <span class="roman">Little Mary's Books</span> (1847&#150;50, co-published with Joseph Cundall) and Cruikshank's <span class="roman">Fairy Library</span> (1853&#150;4), which died after Dickens savaged Cruikshank's temperance slant in a review, &#145;Frauds on the fairies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Household Words</span>, 1 Oct 1853). Bogue also tried to combine strengths in his list, for instance by melding art with travel and landscape. William Makepeace Thackeray's <span class="italic">Sketches after English Landscape Painters</span> (1850) was written to accompany reproductive engravings by his Parisian friend Louis Marvy, exiled by the French revolution of 1848. Another expedient Bogue attempted was to introduce the immensely popular French <span class="italic">Physiologies</span> to Britain; Albert Smith wrote the &#145;phenomenally successful&#146; first in a projected series of &#145;social zoologies&#146;, on &#145;gents&#146;, but when Bogue's printer Henry Vizetelly asked Thackeray to write as many of these little volumes as he pleased he declined because he did not want to be associated with Smith.<br>
<br>Having suffered from heart disease, Bogue died at his home, 76 Camden Road Villas, Camden Town, London, on 19 November 1856, aged forty-eight. Charles Tilt resumed control of the firm and negotiated with numerous creditors. W. Kent succeeded to the stock and copyrights, but many of the profitable ventures had already been imitated or bought out by Bohn. George Bell of Bell and Daldy negotiated the sale of Cruikshank's temperance prints to W. Tweedie, and in September 1862 Frederick Arnold bought Cruikshankiana held by Bogue's executors against the artist's significant debts to the firm.<br>
