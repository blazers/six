<span class="headword">Clark, Sir  Allen George</span>  (1898&#150;1962), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and industrialist</span>, was born on 24 August 1898 in Brookline, Massachusetts, in the United States of America, the elder child and only son of Byron George Clark, a businessman who travelled extensively in Europe on behalf of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, and his wife, Helen Peirce. After coming to the UK with his parents and younger sister Marion in 1905, Clark was educated at Felsted School (1913&#150;15) and subsequently served in the British army (with the London Scottish) until he was wounded at Cambrai in 1917. After recovery he was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps and served in Egypt until the armistice. After the war he purchased, with the aid of his father, a share in the struggling engineering company, Plessey, which then had six employees at its works in Ilford, Essex. With his fellow managing director, W. O. Heyne, he was to build Plessey into a major international company.<br>
<br>The first important step towards success for Clark, Heyne, and Plessey was an order in 1922 from Marconi for domestic radio receivers. This took the company into the rapidly developing electronics business, and Clark into his lifelong involvement with this industry. Subsequently, the company designed and built the first portable radio sets made in Britain. A few years later it manufactured the first commercially produced television set in the world, on behalf of Baird.<br>
<br>Clark and Heyne concentrated on making the company a supplier to other manufacturers, rather than on selling direct to the public, and in those pioneering days they achieved major advances in the rationalization of the production of electronic components. Clark's talents were particularly suited to selling; he was very much an extrovert, with complete confidence in the abilities of himself and the company, regarding business as a challenge and having high ambitions for the company's growth. A major factor in the company's success was Clark's talent for getting on to good personal terms with potential customers&#151;he was the commercial driving force behind the company, while Heyne was the engineer. &#145;A. G.&#146;, as Clark was generally known, believed strongly in management involvement with the workforce, and was a familiar and distinctive figure on the shop floor.<br>
<br>On 25 April 1925 Clark married Jocelyne Anina Marie Louise, daughter of Percy Emerson Culverhouse, then chief architect to the Great Western Railway. They had a daughter, and two sons. The couple were subsequently divorced, but neither of them remarried.<br>
<br>Clark believed that the right way for his company to remain technically up to date in the early days was to buy the necessary technology. The very significant contribution that the company made to the British effort during the Second World War resulted partly from this policy. In particular, Clark took out licences, from America, to manufacture both the fuel pumps which fed the Merlin engines for Spitfires and the electrical connectors which were also for use in aircraft. By allowing aircraft wiring to be prefabricated and built in at an early stage of airframe construction, these connectors helped to make possible the very high production rates of aircraft which Britain achieved. Clark was also responsible for the purchase, immediately before the outbreak of war, of machinery that made possible the company's large output of munitions during the war&#151;ironically enough, this was bought from Germany, and Clark himself brought back some vital components in his personal baggage as late as 1 September 1939.<br>
<br>During the war years Clark was able to build up the company's expertise in electronic systems&#151;for example, Plessey supplied more than 160,000 complete radio and electrical installations for many famous fighters and bombers. At the same time important pioneer developments in such areas as direction-finding receivers (including specially designed cathode-ray direction-finding equipment for the detection of U-boats) took place under Clark's control.<br>
<br>Immediately after the war Clark had to supervise a period of retrenchment as Plessey geared itself to peacetime markets. From a wartime peak of nearly 11,500, the number employed dropped to fewer than 5250. Under his direction, the company again prospered, growing very rapidly through both internal growth and acquisitions. By 1953 the number employed had grown far beyond the wartime peak.<br>
<br>At this time the expertise in electronics that Clark had built within the company really came into its own, while additionally Clark now sanctioned far greater expenditure on internal research and development, rather than on buying technology through licensing agreements, as had been his previous policy. As early as 1952, for example, the company was deeply involved in silicon technology. In the last years of Clark's life the move into systems was accelerated by the acquisition of the telephone companies Automatic Telephone and Electric and the British Ericsson Telephones.<br>
<br>Clark's hobbies were fishing, golf, and shooting; he was a member of the team representing Great Britain at the clay pigeon shooting world championship held in Berlin in 1936 in conjunction with the Olympic games. He shot for England in the eight home international matches held between 1935 and 1950.<br>
<br>Clark, who was American by birth, and naturalized in 1927, was knighted in 1961; he was a council member of both the Society of British Aircraft Constructors and the Telecommunications Engineering and Manufacturing Association. He died at his home, at Flat 1, 26 St James's Place, London, on 30 June 1962 (the last day of the company's financial year), after some months of illness from cancer. By the time of his death he had seen Plessey grow from a struggling company employing a handful of people to a multi-million pound organization with some 50,000 employees. His two sons took over the running of Plessey following their father's death. Both achieved distinction, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76555/', "John Allen Clark (1926&#150;2001)")</script> being knighted in 1971 for services to exports, and Michael William Clark being appointed CBE in 1977, again for services to exports.<br>
