<span class="headword">Perring,  Franklyn Hugh</span>  (1927&#150;2003), <span class="occ">botanist and conservationist</span>, was born on 1 August 1927 at 121 Windsor Road, East Ham, Essex, the son of Frank Arthur Perring, antique dealer, and his wife, Avelyn Millicent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Newsum. He spent his formative years in Woodford Green and was educated at Earls Colne grammar school in Essex. After national service in Ireland, India, and Malaya he went to Queens' College, Cambridge, where he read natural sciences and was later awarded a doctorate for research on the ecology and biogeography of chalk grassland plants. He married on 16 June 1951 Yvonne Maud Frances Matthews, a 23-year-old secretary from Debden Green, Essex, daughter of David William Matthews. They had one son, Neil.<br>
<br>In Cambridge Perring came under the intellectual influence of Max Walters, then director of the university herbarium. In 1953 the reinvigorated Botanical Society of the British Isles (BSBI) opened an office in Cambridge, under the direction of Walters, to produce distribution maps of the British flora, based on dot maps. At Walters's invitation Perring joined the mapping scheme in 1954 and eventually became its head from 1959 to 1964. Although the scheme was initially focused on the United Kingdom, Perring, together with David Webb at Trinity College, Dublin, soon extended it to include the whole of Ireland. The mapping scheme resulted in publication of <span class="italic">The Atlas of the British Flora</span> by Perring and Walters in 1962, one of the most monumental and influential books on British botany published in the second half of the twentieth century. The mapping scheme made pioneering use of punch card data storage for editing and producing the <span class="italic">Atlas</span>, and introduced the use of the 10 kilometre by 10 kilometre national grid as the mapping unit of the British flora. Perring's and Walters's approach was adopted by mapping schemes worldwide, and became standard in recording the British flora and fauna. Indeed <span class="italic">Flora of Cambridgeshire</span> (1964), by Perring and others, was the first local British flora to employ dot maps. In collaboration with Peter Sell, Perring also published the <span class="italic">Critical Supplement to the Atlas of the British Flora</span> (1968). The <span class="italic">Atlas</span> required Perring to inspire and organize both amateur and professional botanists into collecting the extraordinary amount of field data needed for mapping the British flora at such fine resolution. Indeed, much of the data were collected by Perring himself. Perring's guiding spirit also lay behind the <span class="italic">New Atlas of the British Flora</span> (2002), and the data whose collection he inspired have been used to address many concerns in the conservation of British plants.<br>
<br>In 1964 the mapping office was transferred to the Nature Conservancy's Monks Wood experimental station, where Perring established the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and was its head from 1964 until 1979. As interest in the conservation of the British flora and fauna grew, so did the importance of the centre and Perring's vision of the value of accurate mapping of correctly identified specimens. In 1977 he showed the conservation importance of BRC records when he jointly edited the first <span class="italic">Red Data Book</span> of endangered plants in Britain. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, Perring married, on 28 June 1972, Margaret Dorothy Barrow, the 39-year-old daughter of Harold Maynard Barrow, health inspector. They had one daughter, Emma. In 1979 Perring left Monks Wood and became general secretary of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation (RSNC), later the Wildlife Trust, where he remained until his retirement in 1987. Perring's skills at networking, persuading people to work together, and fund-raising were crucial for the development of the RSNC's role as an umbrella organization for autonomous local conservation trusts.<br>
<br>In retirement Perring's commitment to conservation continued through his foundation in 1988 of the travel company, Wildlife Travel Ltd, some of the profits of which were ploughed back into practical conservation programmes, and through running plant identification courses for the Field Studies Council. In 1988 he was appointed OBE, which he claimed stood for &#145;obsessive enthusiasm&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 18 Oct 2003), for services to nature conservation. Other honours that fell to him included serving as botanical secretary of the Linnean Society (1973&#150;8) and president of the BSBI (1993&#150;5), an honorary doctorate from Leicester University (1989), and honorary fellowship of University College, Northampton (2000).<br>
<br>Perring saw no distinction between professional and amateur botany, and was equally passionate in the field, the lecture hall, and in the library&#151;his warmth did not extend to bureaucracies. However, his enthusiasm may sometimes have blinded him to the practicality of a cause. He was interested in a wide range of subjects besides botany, including chamber music, opera, literature, football, rugby, and campanology. He was also a practising member of the Church of England. He died on 11 October 2003 at his home, 18 High Street, Chesterton, Cambridge, of renal failure and cancer. He was survived by his wife and their daughter, and the son of his first marriage.<br>
