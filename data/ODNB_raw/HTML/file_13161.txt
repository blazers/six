<span class="headword">Hey,  John</span>  (1734&#150;1815), <span class="occ">divine</span>, was born on 12 July 1734 at Pudsey, near Leeds, the second (eldest surviving) son and third child of Richard Hey (1702&#150;1766), drysalter, of Pudsey and his wife, Mary (1702&#150;1768), daughter of Jacob Simpson of Leeds, a surgeon. He maintained a lifelong correspondence with his older sister Rebecca (1731&#150;1811), and affectionate relations with his younger brothers Samuel, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13163/', "William Hey (1736&#150;1819)")</script>, surgeon, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13162/', "Richard Hey (1745&#150;1835)")</script>, essayist, and his younger sisters, Dorothy and Sarah. His early education was at Heath, near Wakefield, after which he became a pupil of the Revd Wynne Bateman at Sedbergh School before going up to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1751.<br>
<br>Hey graduated BA as eighth wrangler of 1755, and was ordained deacon by the bishop of Bangor in 1757 and priest by the bishop of Ely in 1760. He resided at St Catharine's College until 1758, when he graduated MA and was elected foundation fellow of Sidney Sussex College. In 1763 he won the Seatonian prize for his poetical essay &#145;The Redemption&#146;; in 1765 he proceeded to the BD; and in 1775 performed a &#145;public act&#146;, a scholastic disputation in Latin, which was unusual by that date, for the DD to which he was admitted in 1780. He was tutor of Sidney Sussex from 1760 to 1779 and at various times filled most other college offices, including dean, praelector, and seneschal. He lectured on Greek, Hebrew, and algebra, and in the 1770s gave a series of lectures for his Sidney Sussex pupils on moral and political philosophy which attracted the voluntary attendance of undergraduates from other colleges, including William Pitt. Hey was one of the preachers at the Royal Chapel, Whitehall, from the early 1770s and curate of Madingley from 1773 to 1780, being permitted by the bishop of Ely to hold this stipendiary appointment (&pound;30 p.a.) in conjunction with his fellowship.<br>
<br>Like his college friend the Revd Thomas Twining, Hey was a devoted and knowledgeable musician, and made many friends of both sexes through singing and playing at private musical parties in Cambridge and elsewhere. In the 1750s he travelled to Bedford to hear an early performance of <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. Despite much anxious deliberation, confided to his sister Rebecca in the 1770s, Hey never married.<br>
<br>In 1780 Hey was presented to the rectory of Passenham, near Stony Stratford, by his friend Viscount Maynard, and afterwards to the adjacent rectory of Calverton through the patronage of Thomas Villiers, earl of Clarendon; he resigned his college fellowship on Lady day 1780. In 1780 he was also elected as first Norrisian professor of divinity, and was re-elected in 1785 and in 1790 for further five-year terms. Hey resided at Passenham, then a very rural parish, from 1782, when his parsonage house became vacant, until he resigned the benefice at Michaelmas 1814, ministering faithfully to his two small congregations and absenting himself only for his divinity lectures in Cambridge.<br>
<br>After his Seatonian prize poem Hey published several sermons, <span class="italic">Heads of Lectures in Divinity</span> (1794), his Norrisian <span class="italic">Lectures in Divinity</span> (4 vols., 1796&#150;8), <span class="italic">Discourses on the Malevolent Passions</span> (1801), and a pamphlet criticizing a bill respecting parish registers (1811). He is reported in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> to have printed but not published <span class="italic">General Observations on the Writings of St Paul</span> (1811), and his manuscript lectures on moral and political philosophy, in nine bound volumes, were deposited in Sidney Sussex College archives after his death by his surviving brothers.<br>
<br>Hey's historical importance lies chiefly in his Norrisian lectures, reprinted in second (1822) and third (1841) editions, and widely influential in the first half of the nineteenth century. But in the latter part of that century, Hey's reputation, like that of his Cambridge contemporaries of the &#145;intellectual party&#146;, Richard Watson and William Paley, suffered drastic depreciation. According to Sir Leslie Stephen, Hey maintained that &#145;talk about the Trinity is little better than unmeaning gibberish&#146;  (Stephen, 1.426). Overton and Relton&#151;who seem to have had no knowledge of Hey's work&#151;said of him that &#145;he was even more inclined to liberalism in theology than either Watson or Paley&#146;  (Overton and Relton, 262).<br>
<br>These readings&#151;or non-readings&#151;of Hey and his Cambridge colleagues have lately become subject to reappraisal. The purpose of Hey's Norrisian lectures was to defend subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. The key to understanding his method lies in the lecture &#145;Of assenting to propositions, which are unintelligible&#146;. Its underlying assumption is that we do indeed &#145;have things communicated from above by Language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lectures in Divinity</span>, 2.94). Therefore if God &#145;sends a message, whether it be understood or not, it is to be carefully preserved&#146;  (ibid., 2.97). The church must inevitably embody &#145;the expression&#146;  (2.99) of Scripture &#145;into &hellip; doctrine or devotion&#146;&#151;including creeds, which few if any can fully comprehend. &#145;All ranks must join in creeds, catechisms, and Liturgies&#146;  (ibid., 2.99). In assenting to that which is unintelligible&#151;including the doctrine of the Trinity&#151;they acknowledge the <i>mysterious</i> in religion: &#145;a design of God not yet executed or made manifest&#146;  (ibid., 2.100). Hey's lectures were recommended to their pupils by the Tractarians. Both his scrupulous reasoning and his frank acknowledgement of mystery left their mark upon the Oxford Movement.<br>
<br>Hey retired to Marylebone for the last few months of his life, died in St John's Wood on 17 March 1815, and was buried in St John's Chapel, St John's Wood. His patrons and parishioners erected a memorial tablet which corroborates other testimony to the love and esteem in which he was held by all.<br>
