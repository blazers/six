<span class="headword">Weddell,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1583&#150;1639/40), <span class="occ">sea captain</span>, first came to notice in 1617 when the directors of the East India Company appointed him to a position of responsibility as master's mate aboard the <i>Dragon</i>. He achieved prominence five years later at the age of thirty-eight, when English naval forces helped the Persians to take Hormoz. The directors appointed him to be the joint commander, with Robert Blythe, of a squadron of nine ships which sailed for Jask in Persia, and onwards to Surat. His arrival coincided with negotiations between Edward Moxon, chief merchant in Persia, and Shah Abbas (1587&#150;1629) for a joint attack on Hormoz. In June 1621 they finalized an agreement in principle which they put into effect in January 1622, when Weddell and Blythe arrived in the Persian Gulf.<br>
<br>The agreement was a product of long-standing tensions between the Portuguese and Persians in the Persian Gulf as well as the desire of the English to supplant the Portuguese in Asian trade. Hormoz was an island city of 40,000 inhabitants at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Together with Goa, Malacca, and Macau, it was one of the most important Portuguese possessions. Abbas had already laid siege to the city in 1602, 1608, and 1616, and recaptured nearby Gombroon in 1615. Beginning in 1616, the East India Company, with the encouragement of Sir Thomas Roe as well as the endeavours of Robert and Anthony Sherley, had begun to trade with Persia. Co-operation with Abbas in the attack was to result in additional trading privileges and receipts from the customs revenues at Gombroon.<br>
<br>With the assistance of the English, the attack on Hormoz proceeded swiftly and with success. The Persians provided 10,000 troops under Imam Quli Bey, the shah of Shiraz, and the English provided four ships under the command of Weddell and Blythe. The immediate pretence for war was the fortifications the new Portuguese commander Ruy Freire had constructed on the neighbouring island of Qishm. His five galleons were unable to retain control of the sea around the two islands, however, and in January 1622 Weddell laid siege to Qishm and took it. Two weeks later, with support from Weddell's ships, troops under Imam Quli Bey stormed the city. Only the fortress held out for two months longer, falling in April. Trade had been destroyed and the city depopulated; or, as one English observer pithily put it a year later, &#145;Hormuz is become a ruined heap&#146;  (Steensgaard, 346).<br>
<br>The war between the English, often in alliance with the Dutch, and the Portuguese resumed two years later. Weddell returned in 1624 to England with a squadron and departed later that year again for Surat. On his return to the Indian Ocean he found that a new Portuguese commander, Nun Alvarez Botelho, had arrived with a squadron of eight galleons and threatened trade in the Persian Gulf. With the encouragement of Abbas, Weddell sailed to the gulf in command of eight ships and four pinnaces, half of them Dutch. Over the first three days of February 1625, off Gombroon, the two squadrons joined in a fierce battle, and the Portuguese withdrew with heavier losses. On the last day alone Weddell's crew fired around a thousand shot: &#145;at sunset we were so faint and weary&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that our men began to drop down for very faintness&#146;  (Foster, 3.81). Thereafter the intensity of the war diminished, although rancour and acts of brutality continued. Weddell organized and led another Anglo-Dutch expedition when Ruy Freire captured an English vessel, the <i>Lion</i>, and killed all those aboard except one. Searching for the Portuguese in the Persian Gulf did not lead to battle, and the murders went unrevenged.<br>
<br>When, in 1627, Weddell returned to England, he joined the navy and participated in the war against France. He began as the captain of the <i>Rainbow</i> and, within a year, became a vice-admiral. The duke of Buckingham first commended his skill in command when the <i>Rainbow</i> ran aground and Weddell successfully refloated the ship. Weddell then commanded a small squadron sent to gain intelligence of French preparations at Le Havre and fought at the battle off the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;. In January 1628, during a royal visit to Southampton, Buckingham presented him to Charles I. As of February 1628, however, Weddell had yet to receive his full wages, and it may have been monetary considerations which led him to return to the service of the East India Company.<br>
<br>In April 1629 Weddell commanded a squadron of five ships, bearing capital worth &pound;208,000 provided by a special subscription for trade to Surat and Persia. He had been given the title of captain-general of the company ships, but the war against the Portuguese had quieted substantially. On two occasions Weddell skirmished with Portuguese galleons, but the viceroy had committed most of his resources to relieving Malacca from an attack by the king of Achin. He returned in April 1631 to England, and in 1632 departed again in command of five ships, with capital of &pound;146,000 raised by subscriptions to the third joint stock.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1634, however, long-standing tensions between Weddell and the directors of the company resulted in an open impasse. His dissatisfaction with the terms and conditions of company service had in 1627 already been apparent. In February of that year he admitted to having conducted a private trade in commodities, acknowledged the public censure of the directors, but remained convinced that &#145;upon consideration of his services they would think he deserved better&#146;. In April 1631, nevertheless, he had again been publicly censured for conducting a private trade. And these tensions came to a head when, in January 1633, a freak accident led to the loss of two ships and, as captain-general, he was held partly responsible. When leaving Surat the captain of the <i>Swallow</i> had fired a salute in contravention of standing orders; the ship had caught fire and sailed into the flagship, <i>Charles</i>, while Weddell was ashore. Despite support from the president of Surat, William Methwold, and others that he could not be held culpable, the directors ordered Weddell home for questioning. He later explained his indignation in a letter to Methwold: &#145;If fines and undeserved reproaches, instead of remuneration for honest services be the East India Company's favours and honours (as nowadays they are) we pray God keep both you and us from such indulgences&#146;  (Foster, 5.317).<br>
<br>Two developments enabled Weddell to act on his disaffection and to help found a trading organization, the Courteen Association, to compete with the East India Company. First, Methwold had negotiated a truce in January 1634 with the viceroy of Goa, which offered the possibility that trade might be expanded to the Malabar coast and Macau, areas controlled by the Portuguese. Second, a group of adventurers led by Endymion Porter who were well connected at court had, in 1633 and 1634, obtained royal commissions for privateering ventures in the Indian Ocean, and now wanted to exploit the new possibilities for trade. They were able to win the considerable financial backing of Sir William Courteen; and the new Courteen Association received a royal commission to trade in areas under Portuguese authority.<br>
<br>Between 1636 and his death in 1639 or 1640 at the age of fifty-six, Weddell directed negotiations for the association and commanded their first squadron to Asia. With four ships&#151;the <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Sun</i>, <i>Planter</i>, and <i>Catherine</i>&#151;two pinnaces, and capital valued at &pound;120,000, he left England in April 1636 for Goa. Sailing with Weddell were many others, including the diarist Peter Mundy, who shared his disaffection. Noted the directors of the existing company, &#145;there is not one of them but have had his bringing up, maintenance and preferment by us and our service&#146;  (Foster, 5.260). After arriving in October, Weddell negotiated over three months an agreement with the viceroy to trade in Portuguese Asia, although details of it were not published, and ambiguity about the specific terms was later to cause difficulties. He established a first factory in February 1637 on the Malabar coast at Bhatkal and a second at Achin. From there he sent back the <i>Planter</i> bearing 150,000 lb of pepper as well as benzoin, cinnamon, gum lac, cassia fistula (the fruit of the pudding pipe tree), and calicoes. In May he sailed for Malacca and Macau, where he arrived at the end of June.<br>
<br>After initial difficulties, by a mixture of force and negotiation Weddell traded for a valuable cargo. The ostensible reason for the governor of Macau refusing him permission to trade was that confirmation of the commercial agreement had yet to be received from the viceroy; but Weddell came to believe, as Mundy recorded, that &#145;they kept the main cause to themselves which was that our coming would quickly eat them out of all trade&#146;  (Temple, 175). Weddell then sought to establish contact with Chinese merchants directly at Canton (Guangzhou). He encountered conflicting interests and actions among Chinese officials as he sailed cautiously up the Canton River. Local officials and militias who controlled forts along the river, perhaps with the encouragement of the Portuguese, intermittently resisted the advance of the ships, particularly at Anunghoy (Yaniangxie), and Weddell fought a number of skirmishes with them. Cantonese officials welcomed the trade, however, and invited his three chief merchants to the city. In August and September 1637 these merchants bought a rich cargo, including at least 500 to 600 tons of sugar, gold, raw silk, green ginger, China roots, musk, porcelain, and silk stuffs such as damasks, satins, grograms, and tafiettas. Even the provisions they bought, which were inexpensive according to Mundy, suggested exotic wealth, and included crabs, porpoises, geese, duck, pears, chestnuts, dried &#145;leeches&#146; (probably lychees), oranges, and grapefruit. Weddell departed in November and four months later he arrived on the Malabar coast, where he found the factory at Bhatkal abandoned and re-established it. He sailed with the <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Catherine</i> for Masulipatam (where the East India Company had a factory) to buy fine cloth, and returned to Bhatkal before going to Cannanore in late November 1638, just before the homeward voyage. &#145;We conceive&#146;, wrote factors in Masulipatam, &#145;never Englishmen were ever richlier laden than they are now with goods&#146;  (Foster, 6.74).<br>
<br>On the return journey in 1639 Weddell and the two ships disappeared in uncertain circumstances. Rumours circulated afterwards that a Dutch fleet had captured and sunk them, putting the scene of the action, according to different accounts, off Malacca, Ceylon, or Mauritius. According to a Scot who claimed to have been aboard one of the ships, after being entertained by a Dutch captain Weddell had been thrown overboard and the ships seized. A more likely cause of his disappearance, however, was shipwreck in severe storms off the Cape of Good Hope, which other English captains reported experiencing in December 1639 and January 1640.<br>
<br>Most judgements of Weddell, written by colleagues in India to the directors of the company, were unequivocal in their respect for his abilities and attributes. Chief among them, according to Methwold, were valour and resolution. &#145;The care of his charge, especially at sea, submits to no man you ever employed&#146;  (Foster, 5.67). Thomas Russell, a predecessor as president of Surat, wrote that he possessed &#145;discretion joined with valour, among your sea [captains] hath not his fellow&#146;  (Foster, 4.48). In public life this discretion gave way to pugnacious and often impetuous actions, whether in protesting or circumventing the strictures of company directors, or overcoming by violence the intransigence of Portuguese or Chinese officials. Weddell was at pains, however, to dispel the image that he acted chiefly for his own gain, particularly at the time of his break with the company: &#145;blame us not&#146;, he wrote to Methwold, &#145;nor brand us with the title of mercenaries, if, being commanded upon a lawful and honest design, we have embraced a better master's better pay&#146;  (Foster, 5.317).<br>
<br>In May 1643 William Courteen, the son of the original financier of the association, received letters of administration in which officials declared Weddell dead &#145;in partibus transmarinis&#146; and intestate. A son, Jeremy, and a daughter, Elizabeth, the wife of Edward Wye, survived Weddell's wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Churry (<i>d</i>. 1656), whom he had married in 1614; another son, John, died young. Frances bequeathed to Elizabeth a portrait of Weddell which, for lack of any further evidence, must be presumed lost.<br>
