<span class="headword">Waynflete <span class="st"> [Wainfleet, Patten]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1400&#150;1486), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester and founder of Magdalen College, Oxford</span>, was the elder son of Richard Patten (also known as Barbour) of Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, and Margery, daughter of William Brereton of Cheshire and Lincolnshire. Little is known of the Patten family, who were of gentry stock. Richard Patten's younger son, John Waynflete, also entered the church, rising to become dean of Chichester.<h2>
<a name="SchoolmasteratWinchesterandEton"></a>Schoolmaster at Winchester and Eton</h2>William Waynflete's early career, already obscure, has been further complicated by confusion with a number of near contemporaries of the same name. Nothing is known of his early career before his ordination as acolyte, and then subdeacon, at Holbeck in Lincolnshire in 1425. Clear and unequivocal documentation of his career only begins in June 1430, when he became headmaster of Winchester College. It is likely that Waynflete was educated at Oxford, probably attached to one of the ephemeral halls of the university&#151;none of the attempts to link him with any of the colleges can be substantiated. There is no record of either his arts degree or subsequent theology degree; the first reference to him as a bachelor of theology dates from September 1443, after he had become provost of Eton College.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1430s Waynflete taught at Winchester College, where he attracted the attention of Henry Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1447), bishop of Winchester, who presented him to the mastership of the small hospital of St Mary Magdalen near Winchester. Then in 1441, after a visit of Henry VI to Winchester College, Waynflete entered royal service, initially in some undefined role connected with the development of the embryonic royal foundation of Eton College. This move to Eton College marked a vital turning point in his career, bringing him into regular communication with the king and other members of the court circle. In March 1442 he replaced Henry Sever (<i>d</i>. 1471) as provost of Eton. In this role he was highly influential in guiding the development of Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, along the lines of William Wykeham's dual foundation of Winchester College and New College, Oxford, and was a prime mover in the making of the <span class="italic">Amicabilis concordia</span> (1444) between the four institutions. He also oversaw the school's physical development, an interest he retained after leaving Eton, and from 1467 until his death was a generous patron and benefactor to the college, concentrating his resources on the building and decoration of its chapel.<h2>
<a name="BishopofWinchester"></a>Bishop of Winchester</h2>In 1447 Waynflete was promoted to the see of Winchester, in succession to his one-time patron, Henry Beaufort. Closely directed by the king, whose letter recommended him as &#145;a notable clerc and a substantial personne&#146;  (Chandler, 299), the cathedral chapter elected Waynflete on 15 April. In a letter from the prior to the pope, advancing the reasons for the convent's choice of prelate, he is described as:<blockquote>a man whose discretion, knowledge and blameless way of life are to be commended &hellip; in addition his prudence, both in spiritual and secular affairs and his remarkable virtues and abilities will enable him to defend the rights of their church. (<span class="italic">Register of St Swithun</span>, 101)</blockquote>Consecrated bishop in the incomplete chapel of Eton College on 30 July 1447, his installation in Winchester Cathedral did not take place until January 1449. Waynflete was an unexpected choice to succeed Beaufort at Winchester, the richest see in England, and the fact that he succeeded Beaufort with apparent ease is proof of his considerable skills as a political manoeuvrer. Nevertheless, he was unusual in that his background was that of a schoolmaster, who lacked either experience in government service or previous church preferments (saving the mastership of St Mary Magdalen Hospital).<br>
<br>Waynflete proved a conscientious bishop. Well supported by his circle of administrators, direction of affairs came clearly from the top. Policies and actions were the result of his personal initiative. His patronage within the diocese shows him favouring particularly Wykehamists and boys he had known at Eton. His prot&eacute;g&eacute;s were highly educated, a number with theological training; men who were primarily administrators in either the diocesan or educational sphere. Commonly resident in his diocese Waynflete attacked non-residence by others. But in neither parochial affairs nor those of religious houses was he an innovator or reformer. In 1476 the relics of St Swithun were translated to a new shrine in the cathedral, in Waynflete's presence. He gave much attention to the administration of his extensive episcopal estates, thereby sometimes stirring up his tenants against him. In August 1461 his tenants at East Meon seized and imprisoned him, and then petitioned the king for relief from episcopal exactions. Waynflete was responsible for a number of innovations in estate management, in particular the appointment of a professional auditor from 1448, followed in 1454 by a major change in the physical form of the ministers' accounts, from pipe rolls into book form, which greatly facilitated consultation of the accounts. His annual income from his estates was over &pound;4000.<h2>
<a name="ThefoundationofMagdalenCollegeOxford"></a>The foundation of Magdalen College, Oxford</h2>In 1448 Waynflete set in motion the foundation of Magdalen Hall in Oxford. On 20 August a foundation charter was issued, which established a hall with a president, John Hornley, and fifty graduate scholars. His reasons for establishing Magdalen Hall were set out as the not uncommon ones of wishing to stamp out heresy and provide well-educated and suitable clergy to serve in parishes. Magdalen Hall was refounded as Magdalen College in 1458, and a new charter reserved to the bishop of Winchester complete authority over his foundation&#151;an authority that Waynflete himself exercised actively until the end of his life. The dedication was a reflection of Waynflete's devotion to St Mary Magdalen, dating from his early promotion to the Winchester hospital dedicated to that saint. Between 1455 and 1486 he purchased or acquired property worth about &pound;600 a year for the endowment of Magdalen College, in addition to the property of the hospital of St John the Baptist, Oxford, which formed the nucleus of the collegiate endowment and which was itself worth about &pound;75 yearly. Waynflete retained control of the purse strings and funded the college directly from several of his temporal estates. His interest extended to the details and progress of collegiate buildings which from 1467 were being constructed on the site, using masons and artisans he employed elsewhere. Nor did Waynflete restrict himself to his own resources. Sir John Fastolf (1380&#150;1489) nominated Waynflete as executor of his will, a trust that both involved him in prolonged controversies on behalf of the Paston family and enabled him to enhance the endowment for Magdalen College. Fastolf had intended a collegiate foundation at Caister in Norfolk, but in 1474 Waynflete, disregarding Fastolf's own stipulations for alternative provision, and aided by a dispensation from Pope Sixtus IV (<i>r</i>. 1471&#150;84), diverted the endowment to his own college of Magdalen, where Fastolf was to be commemorated by the establishment of Fastolf fellows.<br>
<br>In the early 1480s Waynflete appointed a new president, Richard Mayew, and promulgated statutes for his college, enshrining his ideas for the college's development. Administratively the statutes drew on those of William Wykeham (<i>d</i>. 1404) for New College, Oxford; innovation came with their educational provisions, in particular with the division of members of the foundation into demys and fellows, and the arrangements for lectureships. The bishop's personal concern with the teaching of grammar was also reflected in his foundation of two grammar schools, one at his birthplace in the mid-1460s, the other attached to the Oxford college&#151;Magdalen College School, which was flourishing by 1479. In the last years of his life Waynflete was twice successful in bringing his college to the attention of the reigning sovereign; both Edward IV and Richard III visited the college in the company of the bishop, and were lavishly entertained.<h2>
<a name="Involvementinpolitics"></a>Involvement in politics</h2>Waynflete was essentially a public rather than a political figure, a man loyal to the person of Henry VI but whose ties with the political interests within the court circle were loose. There is no record that he was ever a royal chaplain, but he had a close personal relationship with the king while at Eton College and afterwards. In the &#145;King's Will&#146;, the document containing the arrangements made by Henry VI for his foundations of Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, Waynflete was given overall responsibility for their implementation, the king referring to &#145;his high trougth and fervent zele whiche at all tymes he hath hadde and hath unto my weel and which I have founde and proved in hym&#146;  (muniments, Eton College, 39/78).<br>
<br>Political activities were not Waynflete's principal concern, but as bishop of Winchester between 1447 and 1486 he held an important see throughout a period of considerable strife, and in such circumstances he could hardly avoid being caught up in national affairs. Although he was not seen by contemporaries as an undesirable influence on Henry VI, he was closely identified with the Lancastrian monarchy. His most active involvement in politics came during the 1450s. During Cade's revolt in 1450 he was one of the emissaries sent to persuade the rebels to seek pardons, and he later negotiated with them in St Margaret's Church in Southwark, in his own diocese. At Dartford in March 1452, in an atmosphere of growing political tension, Waynflete went with Lord Stourton and Henry, Lord Bourchier (<i>d</i>. 1483), in an attempt to dissuade Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), from hasty action. In October 1453, following the lapse of Henry VI into insanity, Waynflete baptized the new-born Edward, prince of Wales (<i>d</i>. 1471), and on 23 March following he led a delegation to the king seeking advice (without success) as to who should be promoted to the archbishopric of Canterbury and the chancellorship, both vacant since the death of John Kemp on 22 March. As one of the proposed members of the protectorate council headed by the duke of York during Henry's illness, Waynflete expressed a preference for a rota of the bishops nominated as councillors, since, he said, while he was prepared to serve for a period, &#145;his consyence [concerning his diocesan interests and involvements elsewhere] &hellip; wold not suffer hym contynuyaly to serve&#146;  (Griffiths, 80). However, council records show he attended frequently, and after Henry VI's recovery, in January 1455, Waynflete was one of the first lords to visit him, according to the Paston letters.<br>
<br>Waynflete came to the forefront of the royal administration with his appointment as chancellor on 11 October 1456. He remained loyal to Henry VI, so that in 1459 Friar John Brackley wrote to the Pastons concerning him, &#145;The chauncelere is not good to these lordys [Yorkists] for he feryth the Erle of Marche wil clayme the inheritauns&#146;  (<span class="italic">Paston Letters</span>, no. 582). But he tried to counteract the growing enmity between Lancastrians and Yorkists, in particular by organizing a &#145;love day&#146; in March 1458, and his sermon preached at the opening of the Coventry parliament, on 20 November 1459, only weeks after the battle of Bloreheath (23 September) and the rout of the duke of York and his allies at Ludford Bridge (13 October), on the text, &#145;Let peace and unity be given unto you&#146;, reflects what he saw as the aim of his endeavours whether as bishop or chancellor. Waynflete resigned the chancellorship on 7 July 1460, the day before the battle of Northampton, and then came to an accord with the Yorkists, who now had possession of the king. In November he appointed Humphrey Stafford (<i>d</i>. 1469), a supporter of the earl of March, to be constable of the strategically important castle of Taunton, which was owned by the bishops of Winchester. This obtained for him a letter addressed by the new Yorkist administration to Pope Pius II (1458&#150;64), probably intended to protect Waynflete's position against the activities of Francesco Coppini, the papal legate in England. In the politically crucial early months of 1461 he remained detached (or perhaps excluded) from political affairs, residing at his manor in Taunton, but he returned to his Southwark residence in time to attend the coronation of Edward IV on 28 June 1461, at which, according to Jean Waurin, he accepted the new king on behalf of all the prelates, barons, nobles, and commoners.<br>
<br>Other Lancastrian sympathizers were to be politically active under Edward IV, and his earlier loyalties would have been of little disadvantage to him had Waynflete wished to follow suit. Instead he largely withdrew from politics, although he did attend parliaments and fulfil such necessary public duties as commissioner of the peace and <i>ex officio</i> prelate of the Order of the Garter. At Henry VI's readeption in 1470 Waynflete's role was restricted to escorting the king from his place of imprisonment in the Tower and conducting him to the bishop of London's residence by St Paul's. After Edward IV's return Waynflete was granted a general pardon on 30 May 1471. He was not one of the bishops who suffered a brief imprisonment, and his relationship with Edward IV was subsequently cordial; he acted as godfather to Edward's youngest daughter, Bridget, when she was baptized at Eltham Palace on 11 November 1480. The following year, in September 1481, the king visited Magdalen College.<h2>
<a name="Patronoflearningandarchitecture"></a>Patron of learning and architecture</h2>Waynflete remained interested in the teaching of grammar throughout his career. In the early 1480s a revolution in grammar teaching began in England, spread by means of the printing press, and partly based on books by contemporary Italian grammarians. Waynflete was the patron of John Anwykyll (<i>d</i>. 1487), headmaster of Magdalen College School, and author of the most important of the early grammatical works emanating from Magdalen, <span class="italic">Compendium totius grammaticae</span>, printed at Oxford in 1483. In a dedicatory preface by Pietro Carmeliano, Waynflete is praised as patron of the work:<blockquote>Fame will sing such great praises of you, William, most celebrated father who is now bishop of the church of Winchester, and will celebrate for you as long as the steady pole-star is in its stable axis, for the author John wrote this book at your persuasion, whence your fame will be for ever. (Anwykyll, 1)</blockquote>Among the several men in Waynflete's household who were interested in humanist studies, Thomas Chaundler (<i>d</i>. 1490) stands out as one of the leading English scholars of his day, and Waynflete himself was recognized by his contemporaries as an important figure in English humanistic circles. In the early 1480s Lorenzo da Savona, the leading Italian rhetorician in England at this time, dedicated his <span class="italic">Triumphus amoris Jesus Christi</span> (1485) to Waynflete and prefaced it with a eulogy of him. Waynflete was also an active patron of bookbinding. Support for printing can also be seen in his association with the earliest known printed indulgence to be issued by members of the English episcopate (<i>c</i>.1479&#150;1483).<br>
<br>Waynflete was an active patron of building, on an impressive range and scale. He extended the Winchester episcopal palaces at Farnham and Esher, and built a substantial brick grammar school at Wainfleet. In his cathedral church at Winchester he constructed a lavish chantry and may also have been the patron of the magnificent great screen of the cathedral. The nucleus of Magdalen College, Oxford, was designed and completed in his lifetime under his watchful eye. In addition he oversaw the completion of two projects begun by other patrons&#151;Eton College chapel (including the grisaille frescos) and Tattershall College in Lincolnshire, the latter founded by Ralph, Lord Cromwell (<i>d</i>. 1456). Of particular importance was his role in the dissemination of the use of brick in southern England, and he also set an influential example for the later use of brick for domestic purposes.<br>
<br>Waynflete retained links with his native Lincolnshire throughout his life, although from the late 1420s he never lived there. His kin were still there, and Waynflete's association with the county can be seen in a number of ways throughout his career: as a benefactor to the town of Wainfleet and its inhabitants; as executor to Ralph, Lord Cromwell, and thus the overseer of the completion of Tattershall College; as co-founder of a chantry in Coningsby; and by the promotion of Lincolnshire men within his circle after he became a bishop.<br>
<br>Waynflete possessed an extensive library, but the titles of few of his books are known. His will does not mention any books, or, indeed, any personal possessions. In 1483 Waynflete had transferred books in cartloads to Magdalen College, Oxford, reputedly 800 volumes in all. Among the few that can be identified in the college library today are two works of Albertus Magnus, a collection of sermons designed to be read in Lent, and a copy written in a humanist hand of Jacobus de Cessolis, <span class="italic">Liber de ludo scacchorum</span>. He also possessed a <span class="roman">Bible</span>, said to have belonged to St Louis of France, which had been bequeathed to him by John Stanbury, bishop of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1474). He had also received a book as a bequest from Sir John Fastolf, and Fastolf's secretary presented him with several books in an unsuccessful attempt to win his patronage, including a copy of Boccaccio's <span class="italic">De casibus virorum illustrium</span> and a copy of an English translation of Cicero's <span class="italic">De senectute</span>. A member of Waynflete's household may have been responsible for the initial compilation of BL, Add. MS 60577, which includes a poem presented to Waynflete as bishop of Winchester, as well as some Middle English verse and prose, sermons, verse alphabets, medical recipes, and a lapidary.<br>
<br>William Waynflete measures up well against his contemporaries on the episcopal bench, not least for the range of his interests&#151;diocesan, educational, architectural, scholarly. His experiences as a schoolmaster dominated his life, for his success at Eton made possible his promotion to the episcopate, and afterwards the resources&#151;financial, political, and administrative&#151;placed at his disposal by his position as bishop of Winchester were ploughed back into education. Waynflete's last months were a period of physical decline. In December 1485 he returned from Southwark to Bishops Waltham, Hampshire, and on 26 April 1486 drew up his will, which was conventional in form. He bequeathed his goods for the cost of his funeral and to members of his household, the residue for pious purposes and to relieve the necessities of his college. He died at Bishops Waltham on 11 August 1486. He had already constructed a majestic chantry chapel in Winchester Cathedral, dedicated to his spiritual patron, Mary Magdalen, with a tomb therein waiting to receive his body. The tomb contains an effigy of the bishop and his arms, which included lilies drawn from the arms of Eton College. There is also a representation of the bishop, as a small kneeling figure in episcopal dress, on the tomb of his father, originally in Wainfleet church, now in Magdalen College chapel.<br>
