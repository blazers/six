<span class="headword">Bland,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1788), <span class="occ">barrister and writer</span>, was the son of Nathaniel Bland, doctor of law, and judge of the prerogative court in Dublin. Although he does not appear to have been a graduate of Trinity College, he almost certainly enjoyed a classical education before entering King's Inns, Dublin, in Hilary term, 1741. At that date all candidates for the Irish bar were required to keep terms in one of the inns of court in London, and Bland was subsequently admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 16 January 1742. He was duly called to the Irish bar in Hilary term, 1754, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 12 June 1752. The fact that he took ten years to be called at Lincoln's Inn, when the minimum interval for those without a university degree was seven years, in conjunction with his extraneous scholarly preoccupations might suggest that his commitment to a legal career was less than wholehearted. His absence from <span class="italic">Browne's General Law Lists</span> in 1779 and 1787 implies that he was not practising in these years.<br>
<br>Bland is styled a gentleman on the title-page of his dramatic translation, in blank verse, of the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>, his only contribution to literature, published in 1750. In his preface he claims to have completed a manuscript, now lost, entitled &#145;A treatise on the rhetorical power and use of the accent points of the Hebrew code, both in prose and verse&#146; but, lacking &#145;proper Encouragement for the Publication thereof&#146;, he prepared this translation, and other pieces from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, as a &#145;Specimen, to exemplify the Rules investigated and laid down in the said Treatise&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Grammatical Version, from the Original Hebrew, of the Song of Solomon</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). <span class="italic">The Song</span>'s meticulous, scholarly footnotes, elucidating major variations from other translations, clearly demonstrate the author's impressive erudition. Bland's gambit, to advertise the intrinsic merits of the &#145;Treatise&#146; itself, was seemingly unsuccessful because his manuscript was never published.<br>
<br>The preface to <span class="italic">The Song</span>, signed on 10 February 1750 from Bland's house in Poorpool Lane, Gray's Inn Lane, concludes with an advertisement that the author is prepared to give lessons in the art of punctuation by Hebrew accents code. Evidence of further scholarly endeavour is revealed in an undated manuscript note in an edition of <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> preserved in the British Library (11795 DF) which states that Bland translated Addison's tragedy <span class="italic">Cato</span> into Latin. Bland is said to have died at his house in Deptford about November 1788, although the reason why he chose to reside so far from the city, in an area which was then in decline owing to the gradual removal of naval dockyard facilities to Chatham, is unclear. There is no record of his burial in the parish churches of St Nicholas and St Paul which served the Deptford community at that date.<br>
