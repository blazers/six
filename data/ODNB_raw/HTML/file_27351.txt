<span class="headword">Thornhill,  William</span>  (1702?&#150;1755?), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was a member of one of the younger branches of the Dorset family of Thornhull of Woolland, and a nephew of the artist Sir James Thornhill, whose mother was a niece of Thomas Sydenham's. Thornhill was educated in Bristol under John Rosewell, a noted barber&#150;surgeon of the city. He married, in 1730, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1782), daughter of Richard Thompson, a wine merchant of York; they had a daughter, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1800), who married, in 1749, Nathaniel Wraxall (1725&#150;1781) of Mayse Hill, near Bristol. Their son, Sir Nathaniel William Wraxall, wrote the <span class="italic">Historical Memoirs of my Own Time</span> (1815). Thornhill was elected on 20 May 1737 at the surgeons' hall in the market place to be the first surgeon to the Bristol Infirmary, founded in 1735.<br>
<br>Thornhill's attendance at the infirmary was so remiss that he more than once fell under the censure of the house visitors, and in 1754 he was called upon to resign his office. He refused to do so, and it was not until June 1755 that he retired. His services were, however, recognized by a unanimous vote of the committee. He left Bristol and practised for a short time at Oxford, but without much success, and he finally retired to Yorkshire, where he died.<br>
<br>Thornhill was one of the earliest English surgeons to adopt and improve the operation of suprapubic lithotomy. The records of his work, published by his colleague John Middleton, prove that his experience in the operation and his success were greater than any contemporary English surgeon could show. He performed his first suprapubic operation on a boy privately on 3 February 1723. In 1727, when his cases were recorded by Middleton, he had performed like operations thirteen times. He did not confine his attention to this part of his profession, for he was also celebrated as a man-midwife. He was a handsome man, of polished manners, and habitually wore an entire suit of black velvet with an elegant steel handled rapier.<br>
