<span class="headword">Neuton,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1350&#150;1414), <span class="occ">canon lawyer</span>, was born in the diocese of Norwich, but was brought up in the diocese of York, according to his ordination record in the register of Bishop Thomas Arundel. By the end of November 1375 he had qualified as BCL, presumably at Cambridge, while another entry in the act book on 1 December of that year further describes him as an advocate of the consistory court. It seems unlikely, therefore, that he could have been born much later than 1350, both because the BCL degree entailed at least five years of legal studies after preparation in the arts, and also because appointment as an advocate was customarily restricted to relatively senior practitioners at the bar of the consistory court. Although Neuton was practising as an advocate at least as early as 1375, and appears occasionally as a commissary judge of the consistory, his formal admission as an advocate took place only on 23 January 1377. An act book entry for 1378 shows that, in addition to his legal practice, he was also lecturing that year as an inceptor in civil law at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Neuton had received the degree of DCL by 20 September 1379, the date on which Bishop Thomas Arundel of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1414) appointed him as the official-principal, or presiding judge, of the episcopal consistory. Although the court's jurisdiction derived from the bishop of Ely and covered the entire diocese, it habitually held its sittings and transacted its other business in Cambridge, in part no doubt because Cambridge was easier of access than Ely, and in part because the lawyers who clustered around the university furnished the nucleus of a well-trained and competent bar. The consistory customarily transacted its formal business in the parish church of the official-principal, and during Neuton's period in office it met in St Mary-without-Trumpington-Gate (Little St Mary's). Neuton presided over the consistory there until Bishop Arundel was translated to York in 1388, and he continued to do so during the first two years of the pontificate of Arundel's successor, John Fordham (<i>d</i>. 1425).<br>
<br>Although Neuton was named as rector of Rattlesden in his home diocese of Norwich some time before 1379, he remained a layman until after his appointment as official-principal, and was ordained a priest only on 10 March 1380. His patron, Archbishop Arundel (as he was by then), did not forget his former official-principal and legal adviser. By the end of 1390 he had brought John Neuton to join his administration at York as vicar-general of the diocese, canon, and treasurer of the minster. Neuton thus became in effect Arundel's second in command. He was also at least once employed on royal business, when in the autumn of 1393 he took part in negotiations for peace with France. When Arundel was translated to the archbishopric of Canterbury in 1396, however, Neuton remained at York and retained his position there under archbishops Waldby (<i>d</i>. 1398), Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1405), and Bowet (<i>d</i>. 1423), the last two of whom were, like Neuton, former officials-principal of the Ely consistory.<br>
<br>Neuton was appointed master of Peterhouse in 1382, while he was still living in Cambridge and Arundel was still bishop of Ely, and he retained the mastership until 1397, long after he had taken up residence at York. This situation created difficulties for the college, which had to keep a stream of messengers almost constantly riding the roads between Cambridge and York, a problem that became particularly acute when the college was involved in complicated affairs, such as appropriating the living of Cherry Hinton. Presumably the inconvenience of having a non-resident master was more than offset by the benefits that flowed from Neuton's powerful ecclesiastical connections. The library at Peterhouse also profited considerably from Neuton's mastership, for Neuton, like Arundel, was a shrewd and aggressive collector of books and gave the college numerous valuable items from his collection. York Minster, too, benefited from Neuton's bibliophilia. When Neuton died in the summer of 1414 he bequeathed the nucleus of his collection of law books to the minster library, to hold in trust for his nephews against the time when they would in their turn enrol as students of law.<br>
