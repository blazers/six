<span class="headword">Hardcastle,  Joseph</span>  (1752&#150;1819), <span class="occ">merchant and evangelical activist</span>, was born in Leeds on 7 December 1752, the younger son of John Hardcastle (<i>fl</i>. 1720&#150;1766) and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Snowden, whose forename is unknown (<i>d</i>. 1787). In 1766 he came to London to live with his uncle, Nathaniel Hardcastle; after attending school for two years he entered his uncle's counting-house and within a few years was managing its affairs. By family descent as well as by personal conviction Hardcastle was a convinced nonconformist and a member of the prestigious Independent church that met in Bury Street, St Mary Axe, whose past ministers had included the hymn writer Isaac Watts. Nevertheless he was not a narrow-minded partisan and sometimes attended the ministry of evangelicals within the Church of England, such as William Romaine, John Newton, and Thomas Scott, and occasionally was present at Moravian meetings where he heard of their missionary endeavours. In 1777 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1827), daughter of John Corsbie of Bury St Edmunds, another old-established nonconformist family. They had nine children, four daughters and three sons surviving to adulthood. After their marriage they lived in Peckham, London, until October 1788 when they moved to Hatcham House, near Deptford, Surrey.<br>
<br>Hardcastle became a valued friend of many of the Clapham Sect evangelicals, and when in 1791 the Sierra Leone Company was established to protect native Africans from slave dealers by promoting Christianity and the values of European civilization, he was appointed a director alongside William Wilberforce, Henry Thornton, and Thomas Clarkson. At Hatcham, Hardcastle put on display the instruments of cruelty&#151;the handcuffs, shackles, and thumbscrews&#151;used on African slave ships. He corresponded over several years with Wilberforce on matters relating to the treatment of slaves in the West Indies and the opposition of the East India Company to the work of Christian missionaries, and he took practical steps to secure the election to parliament of Wilberforce and like-minded evangelicals.<br>
<br>In 1795 Hardcastle joined with others in the foundation of the interdenominational <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "London Missionary Society")</script> and was elected as its first treasurer, holding this office for over twenty years. He generally chaired the meetings of its board of directors, and many of the early documents of the society&#151;instructions to missionaries, annual reports, addresses to the public, and letters to colonial governors&#151;were from his pen. On the Saturday of the society's annual missionary week Hardcastle would invite a large number of supporters representing many different denominations to meet socially at Hatcham. Sometimes the directors of the London Missionary Society held their meetings at Hardcastle's premises in Duck's Foot Lane, near London Bridge, which he shared with his business partner Joseph Reyner, whom he had known since childhood. In 1801 they moved a short distance to 9 Old Swan Stairs, Upper Thames Street. Here a commodious first-floor room was placed at the disposal not only of the London Missionary Society committee, but also of other societies with which Hardcastle and Reyner came to be associated. The Religious Tract Society, founded in 1799, of which Reyner was the first treasurer, at its committee meeting held there on 7 December 1802 (Hardcastle's fiftieth birthday) first discussed the idea of a <span class="roman">Bible</span> society. Only a few weeks earlier, in October 1802, Hardcastle had been part of a London Missionary Society deputation to Paris to investigate ways of promoting the distribution of the scriptures in France. When the British and Foreign Bible Society was finally established in 1804 Hardcastle was a member of its first committee, and for several years subcommittees of the society met at Old Swan Stairs. He was the treasurer in London of the Scottish Missionary Society and until his death treasurer also of the Village Itinerancy Society. It has been calculated that as many as seventeen evangelical and philanthropic organizations had his support, and he showed himself to be a generous benefactor to numerous deserving causes ranging from the poor in his own locality to the families of deceased protestant dissenting ministers throughout England.<br>
<br>Hardcastle had a reputation for combining integrity and diplomacy, prudence and decisiveness, in his business dealings, while in his personal relations he strove to maintain a mild and conciliatory disposition and thereby achieve the widest possible consensus for any proposed course of action. This happy union of gifts made Hatcham House a congenial venue for a broad cross-section of evangelical leaders who wished to confer together in a relatively relaxed atmosphere, while his London business premises proved an ideal location for the committee meetings of several important evangelical institutions that emerged at this time. And he himself thereby became a key factor in the smooth functioning of many of these societies.<br>
<br>From 1812 until 1815 Hardcastle spent part of the year at Bayton, near Bury St Edmunds, in comparative retirement. At Hatcham in the spring of 1815 he suffered a slight stroke from which he made a rapid recovery, but a year later his resignation as treasurer of the London Missionary Society in effect signalled his retirement from public life and he relinquished the tenancy of Old Swan Stairs. In November 1817 he sustained another and more serious paralytic stroke, which prevented him thereafter from walking but did not, however, affect his mind or impair his speech. He died on 3 March 1819 at Hatcham House and was buried nine days later in Bunhill Fields, London. Memorial services were held at Hanover Chapel, Peckham, on 14 March 1819, and at Surrey Chapel, London, on 18 March 1819.<br>
