<span class="headword">&Oacute; Caoimh,  Eoghan</span>  (1656&#150;1726), <span class="occ">poet and scribe</span>, was one of three sons of Caomh &Oacute; Caoimh. His mother's name is not known, nor is his place of birth.<br>
<br>Eoghan recorded in Limerick MS O  (pp. 268&#150;9) that he married Eil&iacute;on&oacute;ir de N&oacute;gla in 1681, that they had seven children, that Eil&iacute;on&oacute;ir died in 1707, and that his eldest son, Art, had recently, on 18 July 1709, sailed from Cork for France. Art was to train for the priesthood. A later note  (p. 302) plaintively records that Art had died thirty days after his arrival.<br>
<br>Eoghan valued his descent from the once important &Oacute; Caoimh family of Glenville, a parish 10 miles north-east of Cork, bordering on the diocese of Cloyne. He described his paternal lineage in Cork MS M62 (p. 347); his headstone more succinctly affirms that he was &#145;of the family of Gleanphriahane&#146;&#151;Gleann an Phr&eacute;ach&aacute;in, now Glenville. John O'Daly consequently supposed that Eoghan was born in Glenville, but his lineage shows, and Eoghan specifically asserts, that his descent parted from the direct Glenville line with his great-great-grandfather Art &Oacute;g &Oacute; Caoimh. After more than a century of war and upheaval, it seems improbable that Eoghan's immediate family still resided in Glenville. During his productive period as a scribe from 1679 to 1710, Eoghan resided mainly in the east of co. Kerry, near Brosna, close to the co. Limerick border, south of Abbeyfeale: he was evicted from a farmholding there in 1692, and his wife was buried in Brosna. It may have been his native place.<br>
<br>Eoghan's descent ensured that he was welcome among the &eacute;lite of the Irish-speaking community in mid-Cork: he received patronage from Eoin Baiste Mac Sleighne, bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross from 1693 until his deportation in 1702; Uilliam Mac Cairte&aacute;in (1668&#150;1724), from Whitechurch in the same area, was godfather to his son Art; he knew Diarmaid Mac C&aacute;rthaigh (<i>d</i>. 1705) of Blarney, and composed an elegy on his death. His descent also enhanced his eligibility for clerical appointment in the diocese of Cloyne.<br>
<br>After 1710, Eoghan prepared for entry to the priesthood. He was ordained in 1717, and was later appointed parish priest of Doneraile in the north of co. Cork, in the diocese of Cloyne.<br>
<br>Of &Oacute; Caoimh's scribal work, there are extant: ten full manuscripts, four produced in co-operation with Art, and three to which he made small contributions. Their present locations are: Catholic bishop of Limerick's house (O), University College, Cork (C62, C168), Maynooth (C88), National Library of Ireland (G17, G114, G312), National Library of Wales (413D), Royal Irish Academy (23 E 17, 23 E 23, 23 G 2, 23 H 14, 23 I 7, 23 M 25&#150;34, 24 L 6), Stonyhurst College (A II 20, 2), Trinity College, Dublin (H.5.4). They contain genealogies, prose texts, and verse. The writings of S&eacute;athr&uacute;n C&eacute;itinn are well represented: there are six copies of his history &#145;Forus Feasa ar &Eacute;irinn&#146;, and the earliest extant copy of his poem &#145;&Oacute;m sgeol ar ardmhagh F&aacute;il&#146; (&#145;From my tidings of the great land of F&aacute;l&#146;). The whole corpus is a valuable source for scholarship. About thirty of Eoghan's own verse compositions are extant in manuscript copies, eleven in autograph. Not all have appeared in print. His popular piece &#145;Ar treascradh in Eachroim&#146; (&#145;All who fell at Aughrim&#146;), which was prompted by his eviction in 1692, was first printed in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> (15 May 1858); O'Grady printed the full text; and &Oacute; Donnchadha included it in the uncompleted sequence which he published in <span class="italic">Gadelica</span>. Subsequently, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v published his commendation of a friend, and &Oacute; Murchadha published his ode to the bishop who ordained him.<br>
<br>Eoghan is a fine example of the scholar-scribes who struggled in adversity to maintain the native Irish tradition of literature and learning. His work was admired by contemporaries and by later scribes. For the latter there was also the fascination of his remarkable life: the relatively early death of his wife, the loss of a cherished son, and his late ordination to become a respected priest in penal times.<br>
<br>Eoghan &Oacute; Caoimh died on 5 April 1726 in Doneraile and was buried nearby at Old Court.<br>
