<span class="headword">Oliphant, Sir  William</span>, Lord Newton  (1550&#150;1628), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son of Thomas Oliphant of Freeland, Perthshire. He himself married Katherine Blair and they had at least six children: James, who became an advocate; William; John (a future advocate-depute); Helen; Jean; and Elizabeth. There may also have been another daughter, Margaret. After Katherine's death he married Marjory Graham.<br>
<br>Prior to his admission as an advocate in October 1577, Oliphant had studied in France, and before that probably at St Andrews. He made his first appearance before the privy council on 23 October 1577. Five years later he was appointed a justice-depute, on 14 October 1582, and later he acted as depute for Sir Thomas Hamilton, king's advocate. Oliphant was one of several justices-depute from this generation who proceeded to the bench. Having acted with colleagues as an advocate for Laurence, fourth Lord Oliphant, in February 1593 he was granted the ward and marriage of the latter's grandson and heir by James VI.<br>
<br>According to David Calderwood, in 1599 Oliphant gave advice to members of the kirk in Edinburgh in a dispute with the king over whether a visiting troupe of English actors should be permitted to perform comedies in the burgh. In the following year his 363 appearances before the court of session made him the second busiest advocate appearing before that court. His predominance led to his appointment in 1604 to a commission to discuss proposals for union with England, as one &#145;best affected and fittest for that eirand&#146;  (Burton and Masson, 1604&#150;7, 457). In December 1605 he was selected by Aberdeen burgh council to choose other advocates to join him in acting on their behalf, while on 14 May 1606 he was admitted burgess and guild brother of Edinburgh. He had acted as one of Edinburgh's assessors from at least October 1593 and he also acted as advocate for the burgh.<br>
<br>When in January 1606 six ministers were summoned to appear before the privy council charged with convening a general assembly without royal licence, Oliphant was one of the advocates appointed to defend them. However, he and Thomas Craig advised the ministers that they had no defence and declined to appear for them, leaving the much less experienced Thomas Hope and Thomas Gray to represent them. In August 1607 Oliphant was appointed a commissioner for reforming the teaching of grammar in schools, and in 1608 he was named in the testament of William, tenth earl of Douglas, as tutor to the earl's daughter, Frances.<br>
<br>In December 1610 Oliphant was involved in overseeing the making of desks and seats for advocates in Edinburgh's tolbooth, where the court of session normally sat. In January 1611 he was appointed an ordinary lord of session in succession to Sir David Lindsay of Edzell, whereupon the privy council wrote to the king remarking on the popularity of his elevation to the bench. He took the style Lord Newton. On 19 June 1612 he was nominated king's advocate in succession to Thomas Hamilton, who had been appointed clerk register, which in turn led on 9 July to Oliphant's admission to the privy council and his being knighted by the chancellor. Parliament ratified the appointment in October and granted Oliphant a pension of &pound;1000 Scots for life, as the king had recommended to the council in a letter of 8 April 1611. Oliphant first appeared as king's advocate in a criminal cause on 11 July 1612. Later that year he was appointed to a commission of privy councillors charged with deciding controversies between justices of the peace in the burghs and those in &#145;landwart&#146;.<br>
<br>Oliphant was heavily involved in public affairs during the latter half of James VI's reign. He regularly attended privy council meetings, and acted as a commissioner for the trials of the Jesuits Robert Philip (August 1613), John Ogilvie (February 1615), and James Moffat (June 1615). In December 1615 he was appointed a member of the reconstructed court of high commission, and in May 1616 he became one of the committee to report on the treatise <span class="italic">God and the King</span>, a defence of the oath of allegiance, which James had resolved should be circulated and taught in Scotland as it had been in England and Ireland. On 17 December 1616 Oliphant was elected a member of the financial committee of the council known as the commissioners for the king's rents. However, in February 1626 he was compelled to relinquish his place on the bench, following a proclamation by Charles I which prohibited the holding of ordinary seats in the court of session by officers of state and nobles. On 29 May the same year, Thomas Hope was appointed king's advocate to act in conjunction with Oliphant; they operated conjointly until the latter's death, on 13 April 1628. Oliphant was buried in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh. No record of his testament survives.<br>
