<span class="headword">Fleming <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Charteris]</span>,  Ann Geraldine Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>other married names </em>Ann Geraldine Mary O'Neill, Lady O'Neill; Ann Geraldine Mary Harmsworth, Viscountess Rothermere]</span>  (1913&#150;1981), <span class="occ">society hostess</span>, was born at 26 Catherine Street, Westminster, London, on 19 June 1913, the eldest daughter of Guy Lawrence Charteris (1886&#150;1967), and his first wife, Frances Lucy Tennant (1887&#150;1925). Her father was the second son of Hugo Charteris, ninth earl of Wemyss, and after her mother died, she spent long periods at Stanway, her grandparents' home in the Cotswolds. There she came under the benign influence of her grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40735/', "Mary Constance Charteris, countess of Wemyss")</script>, one of the last of the Souls, the group of intellectual aristocrats which had flourished at the turn of the century. In an atmosphere where plays were specially written for her and her siblings, Laura, Mary Rose, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60664/', "Hugo Francis Guy Charteris")</script>, by Sir James Barrie, Ann learned to prize conversation, conviviality, and literary prowess.<br>
<br>Unsuited for conventional schooling (she lasted one term at Cheltenham Ladies' College), Ann was educated at home by governesses. She was well grounded in English literature, but a poor speller. In 1931 she &#145;came out&#146; as a d&eacute;butante at a party given by her aunt, Kathleen Manners, duchess of Rutland. Always competitive with her sister Laura (later duchess of Marlborough), on 6 October 1932 Ann married one of her first real suitors&#151;Shane Edward Robert O'Neill, third Baron O'Neill (1907&#150;1944), a wealthy peer with a job in the City.<br>
<br>Settling into a conventional social life in London and Northern Ireland (where the O'Neills had a hereditary seat), Ann gave birth to two children, Raymond and Fionn. However, tiring of her husband's friends, she fell in love in 1936 with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31202/', "Esmond Cecil Harmsworth (1898&#150;1978)")</script>, heir to Lord Rothermere, owner of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. She was also attracted to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33168/', "Ian Lancaster Fleming (1908&#150;1964)")</script>, a young stockbroker. When Lord O'Neill went to war in 1939 Ann took a house in Gloucestershire. The following year Harmsworth succeeded his father, and Ann, attracted to his power, was regularly at his side at the Dorchester Hotel, London's wartime social centre. She continued to see Fleming, the influential assistant to the director of naval intelligence.<br>
<br>Ann was devastated when O'Neill was killed in Italy in October 1944. At the end of the war, she would happily have married Fleming, but settled for the second Viscount Rothermere, with whom she lived in great luxury at Warwick House, off Green Park, London, after their marriage on 28 June 1945. She fought post-war austerity with sumptuous parties, which mixed her husband's associates, the more interesting aristocrats, and a new generation of writers and artists&#151;among them Lucian Freud, Frederick Ashton, Francis Bacon, and Peter Quennell. She enjoyed being the power behind the throne at the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, where she found a job for her brother, Hugo, later a novelist. Hugo disapproved of her sybaritic lifestyle and was scornful of her continued attachment to Fleming who, while working at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, enjoyed three months' holiday every year in Jamaica. Pretending to visit her friend No&euml;l Coward on this Caribbean island, she stayed with Fleming. In 1948 she gave birth to his daughter, Mary, who lived only a few hours. In late 1951 Rothermere tired of this set-up and divorced her. On 24 March 1952 she married Fleming; they had one son, Caspar.<br>
<br>Spurred by impending marriage Fleming wrote a novel, <span class="italic">Casino Royale</span>, featuring the secret agent James Bond and published to critical acclaim in April 1953. The Flemings bought a Regency house in Victoria Square, London, where Ann reinvented her social life, giving smaller lunch and dinner parties attended by new literary friends, including Evelyn Waugh, Cyril Connolly, and Patrick Leigh Fermor. She maintained her links to newspapers via a flirtatious relationship with Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. She also developed an interest in politics through the Conservative leader Sir Anthony Eden (who had married her friend Clarissa Churchill) and through his Labour opponent, Hugh Gaitskell, with whom she conducted a discreet romance.<br>
<br>Since Ann's husband preferred golf and bridge to literary gossip he was seldom at home. He spent increasing time in Kent (where the Flemings had a succession of houses) and in Jamaica, while she lobbied to live in the &#145;real countryside&#146; of her childhood. Having become wealthy through his Bond books, he bought a house at Sevenhampton, near Swindon, Wiltshire, where the Flemings moved in 1962. In August 1964 Fleming died of a heart attack. Unhappy at the exploitation of the Bond franchise, Ann nevertheless welcomed the ensuing wealth. Her social gatherings metamorphosed into relaxed weekend house parties, attended by Oxford friends such as Maurice Bowra and John Sparrow. Despite right-wing views, she extended her political circle to include Labour Party spokesmen such as Anthony Crosland, Roy Jenkins, and the lawyer Arnold Goodman, with whom she was particularly close. In 1975 she experienced further tragedy when her depressive son, Caspar, killed himself.<br>
<br>Ann died of cancer at her home, Sevenhampton Place, on 12 July 1981, and was buried at Sevenhampton. Her intelligence is reflected in <span class="italic">The Letters of Ann Fleming</span>, posthumously edited by Mark Amory. Although seemingly hard she had a great capacity for friendship. At her memorial service Lord Annan noted that, unlike earlier hostesses, she was indifferent to celebrity and did not exist to please. He perhaps ignored her interest in power (one reason why she courted Labour politicians), but he was right that she brought out the best in an incongruous mix of people&#151;and that she could do this &#145;because she was totally self-confident and cared not a jot for the opinion of others&#146;.<br>
