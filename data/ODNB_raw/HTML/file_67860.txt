<span class="headword">Stonehouse,  George</span>  (1714&#150;1793), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 5 August 1714 at Hungerford Park, Berkshire, the younger son of Francis Stonehouse. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1729, graduating BA (1733) and MA (1736), and became vicar of Islington (a family living) in 1738. Following a conversion experience on 10 May 1738 he was, as the only London incumbent involved, a key figure in the evangelical revival. From July 1738, when Charles Wesley effectively became his assistant curate, Islington was a centre of the revival. A society met in Stonehouse's vicarage. In April 1739, however, the churchwardens prevented Wesley from preaching because he was unlicensed. By April 1740 Stonehouse was an advocate of &#145;stillness&#146;, the doctrine which was to split the movement. Its leading exponent, the Moravian Philipp Heinrich Molther, went to live at his vicarage. Rejecting the Church of England, Stonehouse resigned his living and sold the advowson.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1739 Stonehouse married the heiress Mary Crispe [<a name="cosubject_67860"></a><span class="headword">Mary Stonehouse</span>  (1722&#150;1751)], who was born on 14 February 1722 in Islington, the second of two children of Sir John Crispe, bt (<i>c</i>.1676&#150;1728), and his wife, Elizabeth <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sayer (<i>d</i>. 1741). In September 1741 the Moravian leader Count Zinzendorf adopted her, naming her Maria Theresa after his own deceased daughter. In October she became a member of the Moravians' new English conference, and when their first English congregation was established in May 1742 she was received into membership and confirmed as a &#145;labouress&#146; (church worker), serving in Yorkshire from August 1742. On moving to Germany in 1743, she became eldress of the Married Sisters in the leading Moravian community of Herrnhaag. Back in London from 1745, she was eldress of the London congregation from November 1746 until 1748, when she again visited Germany. She was ordained deaconess in London in September 1749, and in 1750 occupied a leading position in Zinzendorf's household.<br>
<br>In 1743 and again in 1745 Mary Stonehouse took legal action to secure property due to her on the death of relatives, inheriting a further estate in 1748. From 1745 to 1748 the English Moravian boys' school occupied her Buttermere (Wiltshire) estate, and she supported Moravian work with substantial gifts and loans. In the later 1740s she was in charge of the Moravians' English finances.<br>
<br>George Stonehouse was initially also generous, expending about half of his assets in 1741 to purchase for the Moravians both Whitefield's Pennsylvania estate and a ship. But by May 1742, when he too was received into membership, he had already clashed with Moravian leaders. For several years his attitude fluctuated, and he never held any office in the Moravian church. He accompanied his wife to Yorkshire in 1742, but returned after a few weeks. In 1743 he moved to Germany with her, but became disaffected the following year and returned to England. From mid-1745 he was again positive, but finally turned against the Moravians in 1748. Zinzendorf returned Buttermere, but Stonehouse was not mollified. In 1750 Zinzendorf described Stonehouse's attitude as one of hatred, and Mary was torn between love for her husband and devotion to the Moravian cause. Her May 1751 will left him and her unborn child a life interest in her estate, but after their deaths it was to revert to James Hutton for the Moravians.<br>
<br>The Stonehouses' eight children all died in infancy, and it was following childbirth that Mary herself died in London on 10 December 1751. She was buried in the Moravians' Chelsea burial-ground on 27 December. Litigation and acrimonious correspondence about the estate ensued, and by November 1756 Stonehouse was &#145;mad against the Brethren, almost to distraction&#146;  (Bristol congregation diary, 18 Nov 1756).<br>
<br>On 4 December 1755 Charles Wesley performed Stonehouse's second marriage, to Susanna Stafford. Stonehouse moved to the Bristol area, and by 1773 resided at East Brent, near Burnham-on-Sea. The author of a Syriac grammar, he travelled widely to consult <span class="roman">New Testament</span> manuscripts. He also wrote on universal restitution. Visiting in 1781, John Wesley noted: &#145;He is all-original still, like no man in the world, either in sentiments or anything about him. But perhaps if I had his immense fortune I might be as great an oddity as he&#146;  (23 Aug 1781, <span class="italic">Journal of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 6.331). Stonehouse died in Bristol on 5 December 1793.<br>
