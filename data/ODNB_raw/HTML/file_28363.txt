<span class="headword">Waad <span class="st"> [Wade]</span>,  Armagil</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1568), <span class="occ">government official</span>, was stated in his grant of arms in 1547 to be a native of the northern parts of England. His date of birth is deduced from his date of graduation and may err by several years. The address he gave at his graduation was Kilnsey, near Coniston, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where no other Wades are known at this early date. However, there were many others nearby at Leeds, Bolton upon Dearne, and at Aldingham, where one William Wade was assessed at &pound;10 5<i>s</i>. in 1524. Although not apparently armigerous, William and subsequent Aldingham Wades were the wealthiest of the Yorkshire family, all of whom appear to have been materially prosperous. All those Wades from this area recorded from 1522 in a dozen wills, numerous fines, and deeds seem to boil down to no more than two enduring dynasties and may indeed all have been interrelated. Richard Wade of Bolton upon Dearne mentioned that his son Richard Wade was studying at Cambridge in 1522. Given how well these wills crossmatch, it is surprising that none of them even mentions Armagil, an unusual name. Perhaps he had already left home and lost contact with his Yorkshire kin. Is it possible that he had changed his name to Armagil, perhaps at university? In short, it seems unlikely that Armagil hailed from the lowest ranks of society: it was most probably education locally and family support that enabled him to study at Oxford University, where he graduated BA in 1532, perhaps at Magdalen College, and he may have studied at an inn of court. He seems to have been an adventurous young man. It was presumably by unrecorded foreign travel that he developed his later proficiency in both French and Spanish. The notion that a Holderness childhood introduced him to the sea is speculative and unlikely; however, Armagil was among thirty young gentlemen from the inns of court and chancery who voyaged for six months in 1536 (April&#150;October) with Captain Hore's two vessels to Cape Breton, Newfoundland, and Penguin Island in what is now Canada. With &#145;divers others of great account&#146; Armagil Waad embarked from Gravesend on the second ship, the <i>Minion</i>. The crew were reduced by shortage of food to eating herbs and roots and even perhaps to cannibalism. Had they not captured a well-provisioned French ship, they would have perished. Returning to St Ives, the survivors were f&ecirc;ted all the way to London. Waad was not the captain or even an officer. Hence he did not deserve the title &#145;the English Columbus&#146; which his son, as family aggrandizement, posthumously bestowed upon him and which earned him inclusion in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Any narrative that Waad may have written is lost; William Butt's surviving account is extremely cursory.<br>
<br>There is also no supporting evidence that it was Sir Richard Gresham, the post-dissolution lord of Kilnsey, who recommended Waad to Henry VIII, but it definitely was Henry, Lord Maltravers, deputy of Calais and later earl of Arundel, who proposed him as assistant clerk of the council at Calais in 1540 and further recommended him to the French secretaryship there in 1543. By then Waad had married, at the church of St Leonard Eastcheap on 29 May 1541, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1557/8), daughter of the London tradesman Richard Patten (<i>d</i>. 1536) and widow of Thomas Searle, another Londoner. She had numerous offspring with Waad, and she also brought him London connections&#151;two merchants wrote warmly of him&#151;and no doubt the resources on which he founded his career. He was appointed a customer of Calais in 1545. He was replaced in 1546, when he proceeded to London, where he reported to Secretary of State Paget. Next year he became one of the four clerks of the privy council, all of whom secured seats in the parliament of 1547: Waad's seat at Chipping Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, may have been arranged by John, Lord Russell. A grant of arms in the same year confirmed his genteel status. Initially supernumerary and unpaid, Waad was formally appointed third clerk of the privy council in 1548 at 50 marks a year and chief clerk in 1551 on a salary of &pound;50; an annuity of 200 marks for services to Henry VIII and Edward VI was added in 1550. Among several responsible services was that of deputy clerk of parliaments, in which capacity he four times read out the commission of prorogation. He seems to have been committed to the Edwardian regime, both its protestant and socially reformist character, penning a celebration of Protector Somerset's victorious return from Scotland in 1548, which was printed by his brother-in-law William Patten, and nine lines of Latin verse in <span class="italic">Lives and Deaths of the Two Brothers Henry and Charles Brandon [Dukes of] of Suffolk</span> by Thomas Wilson, who died in 1551.<br>
<br>The accession of Mary Tudor seems to have resulted in Waad's dismissal, most probably on religious grounds, and his annuity was reduced to a still substantial &pound;100: he was pardoned on 3 November 1553. Despite composing an elaborate unpublished treatise entitled &#145;The distresses of the commonwealth, with the means to remedy them&#146;, which was submitted to the government and remains among the state papers, Waad was not restored to his clerkship on Elizabeth's accession, but was employed instead in various <i>ad hoc</i> capacities. He was sent to the duke of Holstein in 1559 to negotiate about commercial relations; to Rye in Sussex in 1562 to muster 600 men for service at Le Havre and to collect information on Huguenot plans; and to the Tower in 1566 to examine Cornelius de Lannoy, an alchemist who had failed to manufacture gold for the queen's service. There survive several reports dated at Somerset House from Armagil Waad to the secretary of state Sir William Cecil. The previous year he had secured a thirty-year monopoly of making sulphur and growing plants for oil (linseed) for cloth manufacture. On a number of occasions Waad advised Cecil on the use of new patents to provide monopolies for new industrial processes.<br>
<br>Although only briefly in government service and never in a senior capacity, Waad evidently made his fortune. His marriages and his annuity must have helped. Waad also seems to have had an eye for commercial possibilities and surely dealt on a large scale, since in 1555 he was summoned to account for &pound;800 paid to him by the London skinner and Calais stapler Alderman Sir Andrew Judde. As late as 1565 he was advocating his brother-in-law Marbury as a supplier of French wines to the queen's household: it is not clear which of his brothers-in-law was meant. Described in 1553 as of London and Soulbury, Buckinghamshire, where the connection has not been traced, Waad was granted Milton Grange in Oxfordshire in 1554, and in 1557 was assigned the lease of the manor of Belsize in Hampstead, Middlesex, a property of the dean and chapter of St Paul's, where he was resident when his first wife died and which was named as his address in his pardon of 1559. He was named to the commission of the peace for Middlesex from 1561, and served as a commissioner for the benevolence for the rebuilding of St Paul's in 1564 and as a commissioner of sewers in 1564 for Kent and Sussex. He had secured by royal grant a substantial area (several thousand acres) of salt marshes near Lydd in 1562. Following his first wife's death, he had married almost at once Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marbury, widow of Edward Bradley (<i>d</i>. 1558), a London haberdasher from the same social circle as his first wife. She already had two young daughters whom Waad remembered in his will. According to his epitaph, his two wives Alice and Anne between them had with him no fewer than twenty children, fourteen of whom predeceased him: all the survivors were offspring of his first wife. Waad had amassed a considerable estate by his death, when he held the rectory of Horton Kirkby, Kent, the leases of Belsize and of Lowden in Kentish Town, Middlesex, his own house in London, tenements in Golding Lane, and chambers at Gray's Inn that he himself had constructed. It is a measure of how far he had come that 100 marks was assigned as portion for his unmarried daughter Joyce: other daughters unprovided for in his will were presumably already married, even perhaps Anne, to whom he gave nothing because of her disobedience. Waad died at Belsize on 20 June 1568 and was buried in the chancel of Hampstead church. It was his eldest son with his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28364/', "Sir William Waad")</script>, also clerk of the privy council, who proudly concocted his epitaph on the elaborate alabaster monument, now lost, in Hampstead church. In his will Waad acknowledged his godson Armagil Corkoram, on whom he had presumably bestowed his name. A much later descendant, Armengilda Wade, evidently took her name from him in recognition of his role in establishing their family.<br>
