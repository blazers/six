<span class="headword">Haycraft <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lindholm]</span>,  Anna Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Alice Thomas Ellis]</span>  (1932&#150;2005), <span class="occ">publisher and novelist</span>, was born on 9 September 1932 at 2 St John's Road, Wallasey, Birkenhead, the only child of John Richard Alfred Lindholm, a supervisor of a general stores' packing department, and later works manager, and his Welsh-born wife, (Gladys) Alexandra Irene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffiths. She was originally named Anne, but later changed her name to Anna. She went to Bangor county grammar school after her parents moved to north Wales, and on to Liverpool School of Art. Her father was half Finnish and her parents belonged to a group called the Church of Humanity, which preached a high-minded atheism. In reaction against her parents' belief, she became a Roman Catholic at the age of nineteen because she &#145;no longer found it possible to disbelieve in God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). After dropping out of Liverpool Art School she spent a year as a postulant nun with the order of Notre Dame in Liverpool, but left after slipping a disc: the nuns refused to take anybody with a health disorder. In later years she would occasionally announce to her husband and children that she had always intended to be a nun and would one day join a contemplative order.<br>
<br>Anna Lindholm moved to London, arriving in 1950s bohemian Chelsea, and found temporary work in a delicatessen. One of the customers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55007/', "Colin Berry Haycraft (1929&#150;1994)")</script>, who was living near the King's Road. With a first in Greats from Oxford, Haycraft, son of an army officer, had worked as personal assistant to his cousin Cecil Harmsworth King on the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> but found his true vocation in publishing, and moved to Weidenfeld and Nicolson, where he started its academic imprint, the World University Library. He immediately fell in love with the dark-eyed beauty behind the counter, and on 15 December 1956 they married, at the Roman Catholic chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary, Dwygyfylchi, Caernarvonshire. From this time Anna Haycraft established a style that hardly changed over the years&#151;kohl-rimmed eyes and black clothes, with the occasional Jean Muir during more prosperous years.<br>
<br>Anna Haycraft's stated view of human relationships was: &#145;There is no reciprocity. Men love women. Women love children and children love hamsters&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). The greater part of her life was absorbed by motherhood. She had seven children: five sons, William, Joshua, Thomas, Oliver, and Arthur, and two daughters, Sarah and Rosalind. Born prematurely, Rosalind died after two days. In 1978 her second son Joshua died, aged nineteen, after some months in a coma. He had fallen through a roof at Euston station while train-spotting. His death profoundly affected his mother, who likened the continuing pain to a form of amputation.<br>
<br>In the early 1960s the Haycrafts bought 22 Gloucester Crescent, Camden Town, for &pound;4000. Within a few years the crescent of large Victorian houses had become one of the most fashionable streets in London. Their close neighbours included Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett, A. J. Ayer and Dee Wells, and Nick and Claire Tomalin. The street even gave rise to a cartoon in <span class="italic">The Times</span> about media types, <span class="italic">NW1</span>. The Haycrafts' house became a meeting place for bohemian culture, and the champagne cocktails mixed by Colin were renowned for inducing riotous behaviour.<br>
<br>In 1968 Colin Haycraft decided with a partner, Tim Simon, to buy the publishing house of Duckworth, which had been founded by Virginia Woolf's half-brother in 1898. After the death of his partner from cancer, Haycraft became sole proprietor and moved the offices to the Old Piano Factory, Oval Road, close to their home. From 1970 Anna was in charge of fiction, while Colin concerned himself with the scholarly list. Beryl Bainbridge, who became a close friend of the Haycrafts, was the best known of the novelists whom Anna encouraged and published. As an editor, she was inspirational. She was unfailingly encouraging to young writers, and for a few years from 1993 ran a writing course, with the novelist Shelley Weiner, from her second home in Wales. It was notable for the apr&egrave;s-writing, when wine and conversation flowed till the early hours.<br>
<br>In 1977, aged forty-five, Anna Haycraft published her own first novel, <span class="italic">The Sin Eater</span>, under the pseudonym Alice Thomas Ellis. It was published while her son Joshua was in a coma after his accident, and it was his death, she said, that made her go on writing. Her novels are spare, elegantly written black comedies, poignant with a touch of the supernatural. After <span class="italic">The Sin Eater</span>, which exposed the violent rancours of Welsh, Irish, and English, and won a Welsh Arts Council award, she published <span class="italic">The Birds of the Air</span> (1980); <span class="italic">The 27th Kingdom</span> (1982), short-listed for the Booker prize; <span class="italic">The Other Side of the Fire</span> (1983); and <span class="italic">Unexplained Laughter</span> (1985), which won the Yorkshire Post book award. Her trilogy <span class="italic">The Clothes in the Wardrobe</span> (1987), <span class="italic">The Skeleton in the Cupboard</span> (1988), and <span class="italic">The Fly in the Ointment</span> (1989), about infidelity and betrayal, was filmed for television as <span class="italic">The Summerhouse</span>, starring Jeanne Moreau. <span class="italic">The Inn at the Edge of the World</span> (1990), winner of the 1991 Writers' Guild award for fiction, alluded to Celtic myth, and <span class="italic">Pillars of Gold</span> (1992) was an urban satire. This was followed by a collection of stories, <span class="italic">The Evening of Adam</span> (1994), and a novel about the mysterious appearance of a newborn baby in a remote corner of Wales, <span class="italic">Fairy Tale</span> (1996). In 1999 she was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Anna Haycraft also wrote non-fiction, again mainly as Alice Thomas Ellis, and her popular column &#145;Home life&#146; in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> was published in four collections by Duckworth between 1986 and 1989. This account of domestic life was like a pithy soap opera, where readers got to know and love the various characters, such as the frequently mentioned Janet, who began as nanny to the Haycraft children, and moved on to be secretary, chauffeur, and general organizer to Anna. Anna Haycraft published a volume of memoirs, <span class="italic">A Welsh Childhood</span> (1990), and books on food, beginning with her first ever book, <span class="italic">Natural Baby Food: a Cookery Book</span> (1977, as Brenda O'Casey). <span class="italic">Darling, You Shouldn't Have Gone to So Much Trouble</span>, co-written with Caroline Blackwood (1980, as Anna Haycraft) featured recipes involving such ingredients as tinned sardines, Spam, baked beans, and lashings of alcohol. Her last book also centred on food: <span class="italic">Fish, Flesh and Good Red Herring: a Gallimaufry</span> (2004), a quirky history of cookery through the ages.<br>
<br>In her more controversial non-fiction, Haycraft (still writing as Alice Thomas Ellis) attacked the liberal wing of the Roman Catholic Church, objecting to nuns in slacks and &#145;happy-clappy stuff&#146;. She published the polemical <span class="italic">Serpent on the Rock: a Personal View of Christianity</span> in 1994. A fervent traditionalist (she attended the sung Latin mass at St Dominic's Priory in Kentish Town), she criticized progressive bishops in her column in the <span class="italic">Catholic Herald</span>. In 1996 she attacked Derek Worlock, the liberal archbishop of Liverpool, who had died three months previously of cancer. Sacked by the <span class="italic">Catholic Herald</span>, in response to demands from the Catholic hierarchy, she moved on to <span class="italic">The Oldie</span>, where she continued her column as &#145;The God slot&#146;&#151;published in 2004 in a collection as <span class="italic">God Has Not Changed</span>.<br>
<br>As someone who was tolerant of family chaos and friends' muddled lives, Haycraft's firm stance on religious orthodoxy seemed contradictory. And although she didn't much like eating, she enjoyed writing about food and cooking meals for her friends&#151;though she rarely sat down to eat, preferring to throw in occasional remarks, cigarette in hand, while leaning against the Aga. Her novels featured independent-minded women, but she was staunchly anti-feminist. She despised &#145;new age&#146; theologies, yet possessed a Celtic awareness of the mystic.<br>
<br>The Haycrafts' later years in publishing were beset by financial troubles. In 1988 Colin sold a 50 per cent share in Duckworths to an investor but in 1991 he was forced to buy back his shares in order to regain control. The stress affected his health and he died of a stroke on 24 September 1994. With Robin Baird-Smith as publisher, Anna Haycraft remained as fiction editor for several years. In 2001 she sold the house in Gloucester Crescent and moved to Trefechan, a farmhouse at Pennant Melangell in Montgomeryshire. Surrounded by mountains, reached by a single-track lane, with the nearest shop five miles away, it was not an ideal place for someone who didn't drive. There she worked on <span class="italic">A Gallimaufry</span>, and her columns for <span class="italic">The Oldie</span> and other journals. In 2003 she was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent an apparently successful operation. Cancer was diagnosed again early in 2005. She claimed to feel no fear at the prospect of death, only &#145;huge excitement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). She died at Meadow House Hospice, Ealing Hospital, Southall, London, on 8 March 2005. The funeral Latin requiem mass, with plainsong, at St Ethelreda's, Ely Place, London, was officiated by Kit Cunningham, an old family friend who had also conducted Colin's funeral eleven years earlier. She was buried in the churchyard of St Melangell at Pennant Melangell, close to her husband, and her son Joshua.<br>
