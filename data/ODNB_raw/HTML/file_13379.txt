<span class="headword">Hoadly <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Curtis]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1676?&#150;1743), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, is of obscure origins. Little is known of her life or of her work before her marriage on 30 May 1701 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13375/', "Benjamin Hoadly (1676&#150;1761)")</script>, who, having given up a Cambridge fellowship to marry her, then took holy orders. Their younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13377/', "John Hoadly")</script>, includes a brief account of his mother in his biographical preface to the <span class="italic">Works</span> of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly (3 vols., 1773). He states that his mother was &#145;born at Pontefract, in Yorkshire, about six months before his lordship&#146;  (Hoadly, xi), who was born on 14 November 1676; but her birth is not recorded in the Pontefract parish register for or about 1676, and nothing is known of her parentage or of the circumstances that took her to London and secured her a place in Mary Beale's studio.<br>
<br>Vertue, in his <span class="italic">Note Books</span> (3.113), states that Sarah Hoadly &#145;learnt to paint of Mrs Beal&#146; presumably having started as a teenaged apprentice or assistant in Mary Beale's studio in Pall Mall, and that &#145;she had been for her self set up in business near 7 years before Mrs Beal dyd [October 1699]&#146;  (ibid.), which suggests that she was probably fifteen when she began to work on her own. Vertue adds that &#145;her first beginnings. was with some difficulties to Subsit&#146;. No works predating her marriage at the age of about twenty-five are now known. The circumstances in which she encountered her future husband throw some light on ways in which young women who had to earn a living in London might group themselves together. Vertue relates that Sarah Curtis had lodgings in a house near Covent Garden with two stairways. She lived up one stairway, while two of Benjamin Hoadly's sisters (&#145;mantua makers&#146;) lived up the other; &#145;by this means came their first acquaintance, and afterwards Marriage&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 5.14).<br>
<br>Vertue asserts that marriage left Sarah Hoadly &#145;at Liberty to practice the Art or leave it just as her affections inclind her. therefore after that good Fortune. she painted the pictures only of Intimates &amp; friends&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.113). Her &#145;Liberty to practice the Art&#146; was inevitably curtailed by childbearing&#151;stillborn twins (<i>c</i>.1702); Samuel (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1704), who died young; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13374/', "Benjamin Hoadly (b. 1706)")</script>; John (<i>b</i>. 1711)&#151;followed by successive household moves&#151;to Bangor (1716), Hereford (1721), Salisbury (1723), and Winchester (1734)&#151;as her husband moved rapidly up the episcopal ladder; probably his physical disability (he was crippled) threw extra work upon her. Portraits painted (in oils) during the twenty-five years or so after her marriage indicate that she certainly did not choose to &#145;leave&#146; her art. Those of Bishop Hoadly include an early portrait recorded in George Scharf's sketchbooks as being at Lambeth Palace (but now untraced) and another, as chancellor of the Order of the Garter, of about 1726&#150;30 (NPG). In 1713 she painted Richard Ducane, a director of the Bank of England and governor of Christ's Hospital (priv. coll.); otherwise her known sitters were all clergymen. Her portrait of Gilbert Burnet, historian and bishop of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1715), now untraced, was engraved in 1723 by Vertue, who also engraved (in 1720) perhaps her most characterful portrait, of William Whiston, theologian and mathematician (priv. coll.; anonymous copy, NPG).<br>
<br>Sarah Hoadly's portraiture is direct and unaffected, deriving little from Mary Beale's more fully rounded, Lely-inspired style. Though Vertue considered her skill &#145;remarkable&#146; her competence (on present evidence) was no higher than that of the average portraitist of her day. Sarah Hoadly died on 11 January 1743.<br>
