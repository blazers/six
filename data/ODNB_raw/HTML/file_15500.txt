<span class="headword">Keymer,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1584&#150;1622), <span class="occ">vintner and writer on commerce</span>, is first heard of as a vintner in Cambridge. In 1583 Queen Elizabeth had granted Sir Walter Ralegh the farm of wines, each retailer to pay him &pound;1 annually for a licence, and Keymer was Ralegh's nominee for the town of Cambridge. This immediately brought him into conflict with the university, ancient holder of the rights to sell wine in the town. In June 1584 the vice-chancellor and the heads of colleges wrote to Lord Burghley and to the earl of Leicester seeking to influence Ralegh, while members of the university wreaked havoc on Keymer's shop, tearing down his sign and assaulting his wife. When Keymer persisted in his trade he was prosecuted in the vice-chancellor's court and imprisoned in February 1585. He was released in December 1586 and ordered to desist from selling wine in or around Cambridge, after which no more was heard of him in that respect.<br>
<br>It seems that Keymer then travelled in Europe, possibly on behalf of Robert Cecil, for in 1598 he wrote to Cecil claiming that among other services he had proposed various actions against the Spaniard in Flanders and at sea. In 1601 he addressed to Queen Elizabeth a pamphlet &#145;Observations on Dutch fishing&#146;, arguing that there was more wealth raised from herrings and other fish in her seas than the king of Spain had from the Indies in four seas, and that many persons in her kingdom were dependent on fishing; accompanying this tract among Cecil's papers is a note that Keymer had &#145;spent many yeares &hellip; in most paynefull and dangerous travell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 8.275). &#145;Observations on Dutch fishing&#146; was translated into German and published in 1666, and was reissued in England in collections published in 1707 and 1751. About 1605 Keymer presented James I with similar observations on the Dutch fishing industry, which, with its associated trades of shipbuilding, cooperage, and salt making, was seen to be prospering on the back of the herring taken in British waters, which were salted and exported into Europe. The expansion of the Dutch fishery was remarked on by many writers on commerce, some of whom, like Keymer, advocated free trade as a means to increase employment and prosperity among Britain's fishing communities.<br>
<br>Keymer was corresponding with Sir Dudley Carleton in 1619 and on 17 October 1622 he informed Buckingham that he had presented the king with a proposal that would benefit trade and increase revenue. On 20 December 1622 a commission that included Prince Charles, John Williams, bishop of Lincoln, and Buckingham gathered &#145;to hear the propositions of John Keymer, and consider whether they will tend to the good of the King and the Commonwealth, as is pretended&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1619&#150;23</i>, 469). Nothing further seems to have been done in this matter. The original manuscript of this proposal, signed by Keymer and dated 1620, is in the Public Record Office, but it was not recognized until the twentieth century; other signed copies survive elsewhere. The treatise was published anonymously in 1653 as <span class="italic">Sir Walter Ralegh's observations touching trade and commerce with the Hollander and other nations as it was presented to King James, wherein is proved that our sea and land commodities serve to inrich and strengthen other countries against our owne</span>. This anonymity and the existence of a manuscript copy among Ralegh's own papers led to the supposition that Ralegh was the author. A third discourse by Keymer on trades and fishing is among the De La Warr papers. The circumstances of Keymer's death remain obscure.<br>
