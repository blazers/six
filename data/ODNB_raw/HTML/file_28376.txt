<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wade, Sir  Claude Martine</span>  (1794&#150;1861), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, son of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Wade (<i>d</i>. 12 Sept 1807), Bengal army, from Ireland, and his wife, Maria Anne (1774/5&#150;1863), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Ross RM, was born in Bengal on 3 April 1794. He was named after General Claude Martine, the French soldier of fortune, a friend of his father. Wade was appointed a cadet in the Bengal service in 1809, and immediately went to India. On arrival he joined the institution at Barasat, near Calcutta, where cadets were instructed in Indian languages and military duties. After the shortest possible period&#151;six months&#151;Wade passed out, receiving the sword of honour.<br>
<br>After serving with the 1st battalion 15th regiment of native infantry as a cadet, Wade was commissioned ensign in the 45th regiment of native infantry on 20 July 1812. With the 45th he served in 1813 in a field force on the Gwalior frontier, and was afterwards stationed at the cantonment of Kunch. Through the unhealthiness of the station he presently found himself in command of his own corps and of a detachment of artillery and acquitted himself successfully.<br>
<br>Wade was promoted lieutenant on 21 October 1815, and served during that year in operations caused by aggressive movements of the forces of Sindhia and Holkar against Bhopal, which was friendly to the British government. From 1816 to 1819 he served in the Pindari campaigns, being also employed with the 5th division, under General Sir J. W. Adams, at the siege and capture of the fortified town of Chanda. At the end of hostilities in 1819 he was stationed at Lucknow.<br>
<br>In 1820&#150;21 Wade officiated as brigade major to the troops in Oudh, and in 1822 he was deputed on political duty to Calcutta, as bearer of a letter from the king of Oudh to the governor-general. He was next appointed an extra assistant in the office of the surveyor-general of India, and completed the examination, arrangement, and analysis of the many maps and surveys long accumulated there. So satisfied was the governor-general, Lord Hastings, with his performance that he wanted to appoint him to the political department, and recommended him to his temporary successor, John Adam.<br>
<br>Adam appointed Wade on 28 February 1823 to the office of political assistant at Ludhiana, an important post as there was no regular British representative in the Punjab proper and from Ludhiana, in British-controlled territory, were maintained British relations with Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780&#150;1839), ruler of the powerful Lahore-based Sikh Punjab state with its Westernized army. Wade's principal duty was at first the charge of Shah Shuja-ul-Mulk, the exiled ruler of Afghanistan. Shortly after his appointment important negotiations devolved on him, as the alarm and excitement caused in India by the ill success of British early operations in Burma endangered the northern frontier. Ranjit Singh, then at the height of his power, suspended his operations against the Afghans, and, assembling his whole force about Lahore, was apparently ready to avail himself of any British reverse by joining the insurgent raja of Bharatpur and other rulers disaffected from the British government. Wade, promoted captain on 13 May 1825, was in constant communication with Ranjit Singh throughout this critical period, and gradually succeeded in convincing him of the power and sincerity of the British government. In 1826 the end of the First Anglo-Burmese War and the capture of Bharatpur convinced Ranjit of British ascendancy; and in 1827 Wade conducted a complimentary mission from Ranjit Singh to the governor-general, Lord Amherst, who in return sent presents by Wade's hand to the court of Amritsar. Amherst shortly afterwards (autumn of 1827) entrusted him with responsibility for dealings with Ranjit. Wade did this for seventeen years, and was largely instrumental in maintaining harmony between the British and the Sikh governments; he gained Ranjit's confidence such as to be permitted freely to visit the Punjab at a time when it was closed to British officials. Wade was a short, fat man fond of eating and sleeping; prickly, capable, and knowledgeable, he became an acknowledged expert on the Punjab and Afghanistan, and influential in shaping British policy in the north-west. In 1831 he was instructed to correspond directly with the governor-general, and in 1832 was given the title of political agent, Ludhiana. He was instrumental in arranging the historic interview at Rupar in October 1832 between Ranjit Singh and Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, an important event.<br>
<br>In 1833 Wade mishandled and delayed negotiations for Bentinck with Ranjit, who was very suspicious, on the Indus navigation: an agreement was signed in August 1833. He built up a network of unofficial agents in Tibet, Peshawar, Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, and Bahawalpur, and in 1835 was put in charge of all political relations with Lahore and the states beyond the Indus. In 1837 he advised Lord Auckland to give priority to alliance with the Punjab rather than with Afghanistan. The success of Wade's diplomatic dealings with Ranjit Singh was repeatedly officially acknowledged by governors-general, but he received no other official reward. However, he was probably corrupt and gained illicitly.<br>
<br>Wade opposed the policy of uniting Afghanistan, arguing that it would &#145;play into the hands of our rivals and &hellip; deprive ourselves &hellip; of the powerful means which we have in reserve of controlling the present rulers of Afghanistan&#146;  (Macrory, 66&#150;7). However, the determination of the British government to depose Amir Dost Muhammad Khan from Afghanistan and to replace him by the exiled shah, Shuja-ul-Mulk, gave Wade his opportunity. The main advance of the invading army on Kabul was to be made through the Bolan Pass, and thence through southern Afghanistan; but it was decided to make a converging attack through the Punjab and the Khyber Pass. This subsidiary movement was entrusted to Wade, who was promoted major on 28 June 1838, and was given the local rank of lieutenant-colonel, &#145;while serving beyond the Indus&#146;, on 29 September of the same year. Arriving at Peshawar, his base, in March 1839, he set to work energetically to collect and organize an army, and negotiate with the various Afridi groups of the Khyber region, whom it was desired to propitiate. Wade was assisted by a small but capable staff of eleven officers, of whom the most distinguished were Lieutenant Frederick Mackeson, Dr Percival Barton Lord, and Lieutenant Joseph Davey Cunningham. He first attempted to win over the Afridis, but, though partially successful, he eventually found it impossible to satisfy the greed of all parties, and was obliged to try to force the Khyber Pass. His troops were most unpromising as regards discipline, though individually of good fighting material. They consisted of 5000 Punjabi Muslims from Ranjit Singh's regular army, about 4000 of Shah Shuja's untrustworthy Afghan levies (led by Shazadeh Muhammad Timur), and 380 of the company's regular troops.<br>
<br>The object of Wade's operations being to aid the advance of the army of the Indus by compelling Dost Muhammad Khan to divide his forces, it was necessary to penetrate the Khyber Pass as early as possible. So he attacked Fort Ali Masjid on 22 July 1839, little over four months from when the formation of his force was begun. The fall of Ghazni compelled Dost Muhammad to recall his son Muhammad Akbar Khan from Jalalabad, and thus deprived the Afridis of Afghan assistance. Despite the enemy's numerical superiority, Wade captured Ali Masjid after four days' fighting; and, distributing his Afghan levies in positions commanding the road to Kabul, he continued his march to the Afghan capital, which he shortly afterwards entered unopposed at the head of the Sikh contingent. For his success Wade was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and awarded a knighthood (11 December 1839), a CB on the same day, and the Durani order (1st class). Lord Auckland stated in an official dispatch that &#145;it was not upon record that the celebrated Khaibar Pass had ever previously been forced&#146;.<br>
<br>After the fall of Kabul and the flight of Dost Muhammad Khan, Wade returned to resume his political duties in India, and soon after, at the beginning of 1840, was removed from his Ludhiana post at the request of the Sikhs, who complained of his behaviour. From 31 March 1840 until his retirement on 1 May 1844 he was resident at Indore, an important post. During his service in Malwa, Wade, among other achievements, effected the settlement of the Bhil people, who at that period gave much trouble; and throughout his long political employment he was successful in dealing peacefully with the most turbulent peoples.<br>
<br>When he left India Wade had served continuously there since 1809, longer than any of his contemporaries except Lord Metcalfe. Wade married at Bath on 7 August 1845 Jane Selina, eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Nicholl (1796&#150;1842), Bengal horse artillery, distinguished by his gallant services in Afghanistan, and killed in action in the Jagdalak Pass on 12 January 1842, during the disastrous retreat from Kabul.<br>
<br>From his retirement on the Isle of Wight, in 1848 Wade opposed British annexation of the Punjab. He was promoted colonel on 28 November 1854. He died at 16 Queen Square, Bath, on 21 October 1861. His widow married in 1864 Dr Edward Deane MacDermot of Bath. His only son, Claude FitzRoy Wade (1849&#150;1917), was a Middle Temple barrister and associate of the north-eastern circuit.<br>
