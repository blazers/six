<span class="headword">Lacy,  Henry  de</span>, fifth earl of Lincoln  (1249&#150;1311), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born in December (perhaps on the 19th) 1249, the son of Edmund de Lacy, earl of Lincoln (1230&#150;1258), and Alice (<i>d</i>. in or before 1311), elder daughter of Manfred (III), marquess of Saluzzo.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsinroyalservice"></a>Early years in royal service</h2>Henry de Lacy succeeded his father at the age of eight and a half in 1258, his mother receiving custody of her late husband's lands and heirs until Henry reached legal age. The king granted &pound;300 per annum for his maintenance during his minority. In 1269 he was involved in a quarrel with John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1304), as to certain pastureland, which was decided in his favour. On 5 April 1272 he was made keeper of Knaresborough Castle, and on 13 October of that year he was knighted on the occasion of the wedding of Edmund, earl of Cornwall. He appears to have taken seisin of his lands and titles at about this time, and from soon thereafter he was to be found in near constant royal service, proving himself to be one of Edward I's most reliable, faithful, and trusted servants and friends. In 1276 and 1277 he served in the Welsh war with a force of about 100 cavalry, and took Bauseley in Montgomeryshire. In January 1278 he went to Brabant to arrange the future marriage of the king's daughter Margaret to John, son and heir of the duke of Brabant, and in March of that year he was one of the escort appointed to attend Alexander III, king of Scots, on his visit to England. On 27 April 1279 he was appointed joint lieutenant of England along with the bishops of Worcester and Hereford and the earl of Cornwall, during the king's absence in France, which lasted until 19 June. In 1282 and 1283 he was again in Wales, and received substantial grants in the north from the king, forming the great lordship of Denbigh. In 1284 when Edward I celebrated the conquest of Wales with a round table, Lincoln captained one side of the tournament that ensued.<br>
<br>Lincoln accompanied the king on his three years' visit to Gascony, from 1286 to 1289. In 1287 he served as one of the commissioners who tried and convicted the former seneschal of Gascony, Jean de Grailly, for misconduct while in office. One of the <i>bastides</i> built by the king during this period, Nichole, bears his name. Following the king's return from Gascony, Lincoln was appointed in October 1289 to a commission charged to hear complaints against royal officials. About 1000 defendants were named, most notably Ralph Hengham, chief justice of the king's bench. Lincoln was also one of the commissioners appointed to treat with the guardians of Scotland in June 1290, and in this capacity was present at the negotiations that produced the treaty of Birgham on 18 July. He was also present at Norham in 1291 and at Berwick in 1292 during the deliberations relative to the Scottish succession, and in the latter year was one of those appointed to decide on the claims of William de Ros and John de Vaux. In 1292 Lincoln was one of the sureties for Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, in his dispute with the earl of Hereford over territories in the Welsh march, and he also served as one of the co-executors of Eleanor of Castile following her death. In May 1293 Lincoln accompanied Edmund, earl of Lancaster, on an embassy to arrange a truce with France. In the following year he set out for Gascony, but while still at Portsmouth was recalled by the outbreak of war in Wales. While proceeding to relieve his castle of Denbigh he was defeated by his own Welshmen on 11 November; Lincoln himself escaped without difficulty, and remained in Wales until the spring of 1295.<h2>
<a name="LieutenantofAquitaine"></a>Lieutenant of Aquitaine</h2>On 3 December 1295 Lincoln was appointed king's lieutenant in Aquitaine, a position he held until the spring of 1298. On 14 January 1296 he sailed from Plymouth with Edmund of Lancaster, on his way to Gascony with a very large force of infantry. Lincoln served the king under contract, being paid 2000 marks per annum. After pillaging St Matthieu, near Cape Finisterre, his force sailed up the Gironde to Bourg and Blaye. They marched against Bordeaux without success. An attack on St Macaire failed when Robert, count of Artois, relieved the besieged French garrison. On the death of Edmund of Lancaster, on 5 June, Lincoln was chosen to succeed him by the voice of the whole army and his appointment as lieutenant was renewed. He defeated the count of Artois before Bourg-sur-Mer, and besieged Dax for seven weeks in July and August with great vigour, but was at length forced to retire to Bayonne. In January 1297 the citizens of Bellegarde, who were besieged by the French, appealed for assistance. Lincoln marched out to their aid, but was ambushed by Artois. John de St John was taken prisoner, and heavy casualties were sustained, while the English were forced to retreat once more to Bayonne. However, in the summer Lincoln made a successful raid towards Toulouse, which lasted until Michaelmas. He then went back to Bayonne where he remained until after Christmas, and about Easter 1298 he returned to England. He had been replaced as king's lieutenant in Aquitaine by Guy Ferre by 25 April 1298.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinScotland"></a>Service in Scotland</h2>On 15 May 1298 Lincoln was appointed to arrange the marriage between Edward, prince of Wales, and Isabella of France. He was one of the nobles who swore to the earls of Hereford and Norfolk on the king's behalf that Edward I, would reconfirm the charters on his return from the Scottish war, and then accompanied Edward to Scotland, where he was present at the battle of Falkirk on 22 July. He was rewarded with the position and lands of James, the steward of Scotland, which included the barony of Renfrew. In July 1299 he was summoned to attend the council at York on the affairs of Scotland. On 12 September 1299 Lincoln was present at the marriage of Edward I to Margaret of France in Canterbury, where the king turned to him to resolve a dispute over who should receive the cloths used as a canopy over the heads of the royal couple. In 1300 he was again in Scotland, and present at the siege of Caerlaverock in July, when he commanded the first division. In November 1300 he was sent with the elder Hugh Despenser on a mission to the pope in Rome to complain of the injury done by the Scots, having also been entrusted with a mission to the king of France on 14 October.<br>
<br>In March 1301 Lincoln was directed to attend the prince of Wales in person on his invasion of Scotland at midsummer, and during September and October he was engaged in Galloway. During the next two years he was constantly employed in the negotiations with the French king that resulted in the treaty of Montreuil on 20 May 1303. In June of that year he went to Aquitaine in the company of Otto de Grandson and Amadeus, count of Savoy, to take seisin of the duchy in Edward's name and proceed with its reorganization; he remained there for the following year. On 16 September 1305 he was one of the commissioners appointed in the parliament at Westminster to arrange the affairs of Scotland, and in the same parliament was a receiver and trier of petitions from Gascony. On 15 October he was sent along with Grandson and Walter Langton on an embassy to Pope Clement V which resulted in the suspension of Archbishop Winchelsey from office. He returned to London on 16 February 1306, and was publicly received by the mayor. Later in the year he went to Scotland with the prince of Wales, who was ordered to act by his advice. In January 1307 he was one of the commissioners appointed to hold a parliament at Carlisle. In the summer he accompanied Edward on his advance towards Scotland, and was present at the king's death on 7 July, even though on the following day he was one of three individuals, the other two being the queen and the prince of Wales, to whom letters were drafted by the household, presumably notices of the king's passing.<h2>
<a name="Elderstatesman"></a>Elder statesman</h2>At the death of Edward I, Lincoln was without question the most senior of the English earls, and he remained extremely influential until his death in 1311. He attended Edward II into Scotland in 1307, and along with six other earls gave his assent to the creation of Piers Gaveston as earl of Cornwall in August. Indeed, the author of the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span> reports that it was Lincoln who confirmed that the king could lawfully alienate the earldom of Cornwall, saying it had been done twice before by other kings. The same writer goes on to say that after the king, Lincoln was Gaveston's chief supporter, but that through the favourite's ingratitude he came to be the chief of his enemies. Whatever the cause, by January 1308 Lincoln was associated with the rising baronial discontent. He not only witnessed the so-called &#145;Boulogne declaration&#146; of that month that anticipated the parliament of April 1308 in drawing a distinction between the loyalty due to the crown and that due to the person of the king; he very likely played a major role in shaping this position. Nevertheless, following Gaveston's exile Lincoln quickly returned to the king's inner circle. During the second year of the reign he appears as a witness in the charter rolls no fewer than thirty times, including two occasions on which grants were made to Gaveston in June 1309. All too soon, however, he was alienated from the king and favourite, the latter having bestowed the nickname &#145;Burst-Belly&#146; (<i>Boele-Crev&eacute;e</i>) on him.<br>
<br>The insolence of the favourite, coupled with the king's perceived abuse of patronage, led Lincoln to join with his son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27195/', "Thomas of Lancaster")</script>, and other discontented magnates in calling for reform of the royal household and government. Lincoln was one of the petitioners who demanded the reforming ordinances, and was himself one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50153/', "Lords ordainer")</script>. Although it does not appear that he played a major role in the drafting of the ordinances, he was supportive of their programme. When Edward II ordered the removal of the exchequer and both benches to York in October 1310, Lincoln threatened to resign his position as keeper of the realm. Edward relented, and the two were reconciled. Lincoln spent Christmas 1310 at Kingston in Dorset, and soon afterwards returned to London, where he died at his house in Holborn on 5 February 1311. He was buried in the lady chapel of St Paul's Cathedral on 28 February. His death had a destabilizing effect on the king's already strained relations with his magnates, and particularly with Thomas of Lancaster, whose wealth and power were greatly increased by his succession to the Lacy inheritance.<h2>
<a name="TheLacyinheritance"></a>The Lacy inheritance</h2>Henry de Lacy married twice. His first wife was Margaret, daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16984/', "William (II) Longesp&#233;e (d. 1250)")</script>, a union that had been arranged as early as 1256, and which brought Lacy the earldom of Salisbury; they were married in 1257. His two sons, Edmund and John, predeceased him, and on 28 October 1294, presumably under pressure of some kind from Edward I, Lincoln and his wife made a settlement of their estates which, while reserving a life interest for themselves, entailed most of them on their son-in-law, Thomas of Lancaster, who had just married their daughter, Alice, and on Thomas's father, the king's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8504/', "Edmund, earl of Lancaster")</script>. The settlement was such as to ruin the expectations of any collateral heirs Alice might have, to the ultimate advantage of the house of Lancaster. Margaret died in 1309, and by 16 June 1310 Lincoln had married Joan, daughter of William, Lord Martin, and his wife, Eleanor Fitzpiers. Following Lincoln's death, and before 6 June 1313, Joan married, without royal licence, Nicholas, Lord Audley; she died shortly before 27 October 1322. The properties that his marriage brought to Thomas of Lancaster stretched virtually across the whole kingdom, with particularly large concentrations in Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and what is now Denbighshire in Wales. Lincoln's revenues from his estates have been estimated at 10,000 marks per annum. It is difficult to assess the extent of his personal involvement in the network of receiverships, treasuries, and audits revealed by the surviving accounts, but given his reputation for integrity and responsibility it seems unlikely that he had no involvement in the direction of a household that has been described as &#145;a model of economy and practical efficiency&#146;  (Baldwin, 189). Lincoln also appears to have been a literate and cultivated man. He commissioned an abridgement of the <span class="italic">Brut</span> chronicle, the so-called <span class="italic">Petit Bruit</span>  (BL, Harley MS 907), and in his early days appeared in a short poem by Walter of Bibbesworth, datable to <i>c</i>.1270, in which Walter tries to persuade the earl, who has taken the cross but is now trying to escape his obligations because of his love for a lady, to fulfil his crusading vow. It was with justice that Henry de Lacy, both then and later, was perceived as one of the foremost English magnates of his time.<br>
