<span class="headword">Backhouse,  Janet Moira</span>  (1938&#150;2004), <span class="occ">scholar and curator of manuscripts</span>, was born on 8 February 1938 at Marley, 90 Pickwick Road, Corsham, Wiltshire, the daughter of Joseph Holme Backhouse, cattle-food salesman, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chivers; they also had a son, the sculptor David John Backhouse (<i>b</i>. 1941). She was educated at Stonar School, Wiltshire, of which she later became a governor. She retained a lifelong penchant for public-school food and the <span class="roman">Chalet School novels</span>, and in adulthood her manner could veer between enthusiastic schoolgirl and stern schoolmistress. As an undergraduate she read history at Bedford College, London, under Dame Lillian Penson. Focusing on &#145;The age of Bede&#146; engendered an enduring association with Northumbria, for Backhouse seldom relinquished that for which she felt passion.<br>
<br>On 17 September 1962 Backhouse took up the position of assistant keeper in the department of manuscripts of the British Museum library. It was characteristic of this forceful personality that she arrived in trousers, to the consternation of her male colleagues, for professional women were still quite new to these fringes of the civil service. She abandoned her postgraduate study of litanies under Francis Wormald in favour of learning on the job. During thirty-five years in the department she came to know the illuminated collections better than anyone, forged a close working relationship with her complex colleague Derek H. Turner and, having succeeded him in building a vibrant exhibitions programme, accompanied many international loans. Prominent among these adventures for Backhouse (who enjoyed the spotlight and handled publicity well) were escorting the gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander back to Bulgaria (1977) and taking the <span class="roman">Lindisfarne gospels</span> to Durham Cathedral during the 1300th anniversary of the death of St Cuthbert (1987). She reverently laid the book upon his tomb before placing it on exhibition; thenceforth she would holiday on Holy Island annually.<br>
<br>Backhouse relished the high and low brow with equal aplomb. Her interests were wide and she blossomed in the face of the demanding range of manuscripts in the collections. Training was broad and immersion complete: although she was a medievalist an early task was arranging and cataloguing the papers of Lady Anne Blunt, co-founder of the stud of Arabian horses at Crabbet Park. She later contributed to the stud's centenary celebrations and each year attended Badminton horse trials.<br>
<br>During a distinguished and colourful career Backhouse's scholarly contribution to major exhibitions included <span class="italic">Renaissance Painting in Manuscripts</span> (1983), <span class="italic">The Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art, 966&#150;1066</span> (1984), <span class="italic">The Age of Chivalry</span> (1987), and <span class="italic">The Making of England: Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 600&#150;900</span> (1991). Her publications ranged from facsimile commentaries and a plethora of academic papers to well-written booklets on individual treasures of the British Library&#151;including <span class="italic">The Luttrell Psalter</span> (1989), <span class="italic">The Bedford Hours</span> (1990), <span class="italic">The Isabella Breviary</span> (1993)&#151;and popular studies, <span class="italic">Books of Hours</span> (1993), <span class="italic">The Lindisfarne Gospels</span> (1981), <span class="italic">The Illuminated Page: Ten Centuries of Manuscript Painting in the British Library</span> (1997), and <span class="italic">The Sherborne Missal</span> (1999). She also contributed &#145;The Royal Library from Edward IV to Henry VII&#146; to the third volume of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of the Book in Britain</span> (1998). It was the people who made and owned the manuscripts who really intrigued her and, although held in great respect as a scholar by her peers, she sought to appeal primarily to a wider audience (her &#145;Joe Public&#146;). She would lecture with equal vivacity and commitment to prestigious conferences and amateur societies, maintaining that the needs of those who drew creative inspiration from illuminated manuscripts were as valid as those of academics.<br>
<br>In 1973 the British Museum library was absorbed into the newly created British Library, which moved to St Pancras in 1998. Fortunately this was the year of Backhouse's retirement, for she remained to the last a museum person; the brave new world of the digital library held no allure. A productive retirement beckoned, marked by the presentation of a Festschrift in her honour, <span class="italic">Illuminating the Book: Makers and Interpreters</span> (1998). She divided her time between a flat in Richmond, Surrey, and a country cottage near her birthplace, and threw herself into further publishing and learned society work. She was a member of the Henry Bradshaw Society and of the advisory council of the National Art Collections Fund (1995) and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1983) and of the Comit&eacute; Internationale de Pal&eacute;ographie Latine (1993). She also served on the steering committee of the Harlaxton Medieval Symposium, editing its 1998 proceedings. In 2004 she was diagnosed with cancer, which advanced rapidly. She continued to work on an article on the French illuminator Jean Bourdichon and on <span class="italic">Illumination from Books of Hours</span> (2005) in the Royal United Hospital, Bath, where she died, unmarried, on 3 November 2004. The funeral service (followed by cremation) in Bath was attended by family and close friends, and a memorial service was held in St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, on 25 May 2005.<br>
