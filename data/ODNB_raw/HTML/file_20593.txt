<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  George</span>, first Lord Banff  (<em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Walter Ogilvy of Dunlugas and Banff (<i>d</i>. 1627/8) and Helen Urquhart, daughter of Walter Urquhart of Cromarty. Ogilvy married Margaret Irvine, daughter of Alexander Irvine of Drum, in or before 1611, and they had one daughter. After her death he married Janet Sutherland, daughter of William Sutherland of Duffus, and they had at least four children&#151;one son (George, second Lord Banff) and three daughters. In July 1629 Janet submitted a complaint to the privy council alleging that her husband had treated her and two of their children with cruelty, seeking to starve her to death and leaving her for dead after beating her. After hearing the parties and witness the council absolved Ogilvy.<br>
<br>Ogilvy was created a baronet on 30 July 1627, having been knighted previously, and played an active role in local affairs. In the turbulent feuding of north-east Scotland he killed his cousin James Ogilvy in 1628, and made assythment (compensation) to the family of his victim. He supported James Crichton of Frendraught in his feud with the Gordons of Rothiemay, but was not prosecuted for his involvement in the killing of William Gordon of Rothiemay in 1630 as he had had a commission to arrest him. He was appointed a JP for Banffshire in 1634, and sheriff in 1636. In the first bishops' war of 1639 Ogilvy took the leading role in persuading local royalists to resist the covenanters. When the marquess of Huntly and other leaders prevaricated or submitted he &#145;stoutly stood out the king's man&#146;  (Spalding, 2.163). He inspired the successful attack, led by him and Sir John Gordon of Haddo, on covenanting forces at the &#145;trot of Turriff&#146; on 13 May, and entered Aberdeen two days later. However, on 22 May the royalist forces withdrew, and reached an agreement with the covenanters to lay down their arms. On 30 May Ogilvy sailed from Macduff, intending to join Charles I in England, but, after meeting with a ship bringing Lord Aboyne and others north to resume resistance, he landed with them in Aberdeen. However, their position was unsustainable, as the earl of Montrose had marched strong covenanting forces northwards, and again the royalists were forced into submission, but Ogilvy refused to swear to the national covenant and about September joined the king in England. He remained in England during the second bishops' war of 1640, during which the covenanters took their revenge for his conduct in 1639 by destroying his houses and confiscating his revenues. Charles I is said to have provided partial compensation for his losses by a gift in 1642 of 10,000 merks Scots in gold. Ogilvy was with the king on the latter's visit to Edinburgh late in 1641. He remained in Scotland when the king left, but again visited him in England in 1642, being created Lord Banff on 31 August. He took no active part in the royalist risings of Huntly and Montrose in 1644, but his lack of commitment to the covenanting cause none the less brought action against him, including a fine, though by March 1647 he was sufficiently rehabilitated to be appointed a member of the committee of war for Banffshire.<br>
<br>In 1648 Banff supported the engagement alliance of royalists and moderate covenanters. After taking his seat in parliament (for the first time) on 2 March 1648, he was appointed a colonel and a member of the Banffshire committee of war. He appears to have played no active military role (though his son fought in the engagers' army), but his support for the engagement was sufficient to arouse the wrath of the church. After the defeat of the engagers his case was considered for nearly a year by church courts before his declarations of repentance and of adherence to the solemn league and covenant were accepted by the presbytery of Fordyce in April 1651. After the Cromwellian conquest of Scotland, Banff's royalism (or perhaps rather that of his son, who had fought at the battle of Worcester in September 1651) brought renewed persecution. A fine of &pound;1000 sterling was imposed on him in 1654, though this was soon reduced by two-thirds and he was appointed a JP in 1656. Restoration of monarchy in 1660 brought new troubles, for he was summoned by the privy council for the slaughter of John Gordon. Banff took his seat in parliament again on 18 June 1663, but he died on 11 August.<br>
<br>Lord Banff's role in stirring the royalists of north-east Scotland into military opposition to the covenanters in 1639 was notable, earning from enemies the judgement that he was &#145;a rash and profane man&#146;  (R. Baillie, <span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3 vols., 1841&#150;2, 2.204). He seems to have quickly repented this rashness, for after the destruction of his houses that it brought about he was, as James Gordon commented, &#145;never more cordiall [whole-hearted] in the King's service&#146; and &#145;never did engadge any mor&#146;  (J. Gordon, 2.263&#150;4), advancing age and financial difficulties doubtless helping to restrain him from action.<br>
