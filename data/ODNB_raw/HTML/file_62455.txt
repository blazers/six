<span class="headword">Lant&eacute;ri,  Edward <span class="st"> [&Eacute;douard]</span></span>  (1848&#150;1917), <span class="occ">sculptor and teacher of sculpture</span>, was born at Auxerre, France, on 1 November 1848, the son of a tradesman. Although he showed precocious talent as a violinist, in his mid-teens he accepted an offer from the academic sculptor Aim&eacute; Millet to receive training in his Paris studio; at the same time he attended the Petite &Eacute;cole de Dessin (<i>c</i>.1863&#150;<i>c</i>.1865). He subsequently worked for Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph Duret and received a more formal sculptural education at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, under Pierre-Jules Cavelier and Eug&egrave;ne Guillaume (<i>c</i>.1865&#150;<i>c</i>.1868). The Franco-Prussian War brought a temporary setback to Lant&eacute;ri's career: for eighteen months he worked as a cabinet-maker's assistant, repairing furniture damaged during the bombardment of Paris. In July 1870 Lant&eacute;ri married, probably Honorine (the name of his widow).<br>
<br>Through the expatriate French sculptor Jules Dalou, who was based in London, Lant&eacute;ri received an offer of employment from Joseph Edgar Boehm in 1872. The critic M. H. Spielmann later claimed that Lant&eacute;ri's &#145;extraordinary skill and intelligent perception are to be found in much of the best productions&#146; of Boehm  (Spielmann, 128). While Lant&eacute;ri certainly contributed to Boehm's success, their relationship was founded on mutual respect and friendship and lasted until Boehm's death in 1890. Boehm probably helped secure Lant&eacute;ri's appointment as Dalou's successor as instructor in modelling at the National Art Training School, South Kensington, in 1880. As Lant&eacute;ri was little known at the time, this caused controversy and press comment, with Edmund Gosse calling the affair &#145;the Dalou&#150;Boehm job&#146;  (Stocker, <span class="italic">Royalist and Realist</span>, 332).<br>
<br>It soon emerged, however, that Lant&eacute;ri's appointment was little short of inspirational. He remained at the school (from 1896 the Royal College of Art) for thirty-seven years and was made its first professor of sculpture and modelling in 1901. Although the institution was severely criticized in two government reports in 1887 and 1911, on both occasions Lant&eacute;ri's areas of activity were handsomely endorsed. Student numbers reflected his success, the total increasing from twelve in 1874 to 105 in 1899. A high point came in 1903, when Lant&eacute;ri's friend Auguste Rodin visited the Royal College of Art and pronounced himself &#145;delighted with all the students' work&#146;  (Frayling, 84). Spielmann claimed that &#145;A very large proportion of the most successful British sculptors of to-day who are not more than middle-aged owe to Professor Lant&eacute;ri much of the success they have achieved&#146;  (Spielmann, 1). They included Alfred Gilbert, Alfred Drury, and Albert Toft, all major figures in the New Sculpture. Lant&eacute;ri's students of a later generation, such as Charles Sargeant Jagger, Gilbert Ledward, and Charles Wheeler, took sculpture into the era of art deco and early modernism. Also significant was a talented array of women sculptors, including Margaret Giles, Ruby Levick, and Gwendolyn Williams.<br>
<br>In response to requests to publish his notes used for demonstration classes, Lant&eacute;ri compiled the three-volume text <span class="italic">Modelling: a Guide for Teachers and Students</span> (1902&#150;11), described as &#145;<i>the</i> classic treatise on the techniques of figurative sculpture&#146;  (N. C. Hale in Lant&eacute;ri, <span class="italic">Modelling and Sculpture</span>, 1.vi); a reflection of its enduring significance was its republication in 1965 and 1985. Lant&eacute;ri avoided being drily academic, stressing that &#145;art is essentially individual&#146;  (ibid., 2). The aim of art teaching should be &#145;to put within the pupil's grasp all that is necessary to help him to express his thoughts by the simplest, surest and quickest means&#146;  (ibid., 3). Lant&eacute;ri regarded drawing as &#145;the principal foundation of sculpture&#146;  (p. 4), and knowledge of anatomy was equally essential  (ibid., 4). Elaborate modelling tools were unnecessary: &#145;the human finger is more firm, and at the same time more sensitive, than any mechanical instrument. It is nature's spatula and should be used in preference to anything else&#146;  (Staley, 84). In handling composition he advised restraint on the teacher's part: &#145;For a master to impose on his pupil his own conception of a subject is entirely contrary to the rules of artistic teaching&#146;  (Lant&eacute;ri, <span class="italic">Modelling and Sculpture</span>, 2.98). Lant&eacute;ri practised what he preached. One of his pupils, Francis Shurrock, who later laid the foundations of sculptural education in New Zealand, recalled: &#145;None of Lant&eacute;ri's students worked as he did, each developing in his own way, &amp; that is just what Lant&eacute;ri wanted&#146;  (Stocker, &#145;Francis Shurrock&#146;, 50).<br>
<br>Although Lant&eacute;ri could only devote limited time to his own sculpture, he exhibited seventy works at the Royal Academy between 1885 and 1917. Their poor survival rate has contributed to his relatively low art historical profile. To some extent Lant&eacute;ri was himself culpable: a perfectionist, he was recorded by Spielmann as having destroyed many works. His stylistic versatility is reflected in the lively rococo modelling of <span class="italic">Sketch for a Garden Design</span> and the more serene, classical carving <span class="italic">The Duet</span> (1891), a sculptural counterpart to the paintings of Albert Moore and Frederic Leighton. Surviving works&#151;such as the busts of <span class="italic">The Peasant</span> (<i>c</i>.1901) and <span class="italic">Alfred Stevens</span> (1911; both Tate collection)&#151;convey confidence in handling material and psychological insight. Lant&eacute;ri's most prominently sited works are his architectural carvings for the Victoria and Albert Museum (1905&#150;7). They were executed with assistance from four advanced Royal College of Art students and comprise <span class="italic">Fame</span> at the summit of the main tower and figures of <span class="italic">Sculpture</span> and <span class="italic">Architecture</span> below. As a medallist Lant&eacute;ri was second only to Alphonse Legros in significance. Like Legros, he encouraged the revival of the cast medal and responded to Italian Renaissance precedents, seen for example in <span class="italic">Julio Monticelli</span> (1888; British Museum, London).<br>
<br>Lant&eacute;ri died at his home at 50 Perryn Road, East Acton, Middlesex, on 18 December 1917 and was succeeded at the Royal College of Art by his former pupil Francis Derwent Wood. Apart from Sir Edmund Gosse&#151;who unaccountably omitted Lant&eacute;ri from his influential essay &#145;The New Sculpture&#146;&#151;reactions to him were invariably enthusiastic. Shurrock claimed, &#145;Lant&eacute;ri was more than a teacher, he was an inspiration&#146;  (Stocker, &#145;Francis Shurrock&#146;, 50), and Gilbert called him a &#145;man of infinite sensibility, subtle imagination and inflexible will, endowed, too, with natural poetical instincts&#146;  (McAllister, 25). Examples of his work are in the Tate collection; the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris. His statue of Sir Samuel Sadler may be seen in Victoria Square, Middlesbrough, and that of Ludwig Mond at Winnington Lane, Northwich, Cheshire.<br>
