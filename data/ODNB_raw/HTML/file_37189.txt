<span class="headword">Besterman,  Theodore Deodatus Nathaniel</span>  (1904&#150;1976), <span class="occ">psychical researcher and bibliographer</span>, was born on 22 November 1904 in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, Poland, and named Nataniel. He was the second son (there were no daughters) of Benjamin J. N. Besterman, diamond merchant, and his wife, Golda Augusta Krengiel, and probably grew up in Britain.<br>
<br>The single-minded energy which was Besterman's main characteristic brought him, early on and despite his lack of education, the chairmanship of the British Federation of Youth Movements (1925). Besterman claimed that he was largely self-educated at the British Museum Library and it is typical that his first separate publication should have been a bibliography (1924) of the well-known theosophist Annie Besant. He was investigating officer to the Society for Psychical Research, 1927&#150;35, and published widely on associated matters.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Besterman turned his attention towards bibliography, becoming both special lecturer at the London School of Librarianship and joint editor of the important, if short-lived, series <span class="roman">Oxford Books in Bibliography</span>, as well as writing his classic <span class="italic">The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography</span> (1935). An indefatigable, largely single-handed, compiler and one who aimed essentially at making bibliographical and other information available, he published privately the first edition of his <span class="italic">A World Bibliography of Bibliographies</span> in 1939; this work, constantly enlarged, was to make his a household name with librarians worldwide. He was also closely associated with the British union catalogues of both periodicals and music, as well as being the first editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Documentation</span>.<br>
<br>In these years Besterman published on American history and established his own private press, the Guyon House Press, which, however, came to an end when destroyed in the air raids of December 1940. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Artillery and the Army Bureau of Current Affairs, the latter foreshadowing his immediately post-war position as head of the department for the exchange of information in UNESCO, where he worked towards universal bibliographical control. Besterman's advocacy of his causes was ardent rather than diplomatic, and around 1950 he turned to publishing the correspondence and works of Voltaire, a liberal spirit with whom he identified. Living, by agreement with the city of Geneva, in Voltaire's former house Les D&eacute;lices, he founded the Institut et Mus&eacute;e Voltaire there (1952), while editing that writer's correspondence (107 vols., 1953&#150;65) as well as the equally multi-volume series <span class="roman">Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century</span>. He created the conferences which gave birth to the International Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies and was the leading figure in the post-war rise of those studies outside the Anglo-Saxon world. Despite his intensive activity on both bibliographical and scholarly fronts, he wrote numerous other works and started a series of facsimiles of the printed sources of Western art, for which he collected both books and watercolours.<br>
<br>On 6 April 1925 Besterman married Henrietta Birley (<i>b</i>. 1893/4) of Hampstead, a secretary, but the marriage only lasted some ten years. Besterman subsequently married Evelyn, younger daughter of Arthur Mack, of New York. She had one son of her previous marriage. The marriage was dissolved in 1958 and Besterman married Marie-Louise van Muyden of Geneva.<br>
<br>Following disagreements with the Genevan authorities he moved in the later 1960s, first to London and then to Banbury, where he died at the Horton General Hospital on 10 November 1976, having arranged with the University of Oxford for the bequest of his scholarly research interests (the Voltaire Foundation) to the Taylor Institution there.<br>
