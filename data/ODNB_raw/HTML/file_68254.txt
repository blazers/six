<span class="headword">Evelyn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Browne]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1635&#150;1709), <span class="occ">correspondent</span>, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3693/', "Sir Richard Browne (1605&#150;1683)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pretyman (1610&#150;1652). Mary spent most of her childhood and adolescence in France, where her father represented Charles I. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8996/', "John Evelyn (1620&#150;1706)")</script> on 27 June 1647 in Paris; she was twelve or thirteen, he was twenty-six. She returned to England in June 1652, residing with her husband first at Sayes Court, in Deptford, and later at Wotton, in Surrey. She gave birth to five sons (Richard, John Stansfield, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8995/', "John Evelyn")</script> , George, and Richard), and three daughters (<a href="#cosubject_68254">Mary [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Elizabeth, and Susanna). The recipient of a careful humanist education, she played an important role in educating her children, only the youngest of whom survived her. She was fluent in French, knew Italian, and studied mathematics and drawing. Though her marriage and family duties in many ways limited her intellectual pursuits her marriage was both a friendship and a partnership. Her husband's plan for an otherwise all-male mathematical college included her, and she designed the frontispiece for his 1656 translation of Lucretius. After his death she said of him that &#145;His care of my Education was such as might become a Father a Lover a Friend and Husband&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.37). She died on 9 February 1709 at her home in Dover Street, London, and was buried on the 14th at Wotton.<br>
<br>After the publication of the diary of her husband, John Evelyn, in 1818 Mary Evelyn became with him a model of Anglican piety and domestic virtue. Though her husband credits her with authorship of <span class="italic">The picture of the Princess Henrietta</span>, published as a broadsheet in 1660, the attribution has been questioned  (see Hiscock, 45), and it is in her correspondence that her wit, perceptiveness, and strength of character are most evident. Her letters to her son's tutor at Oxford, Ralph Bohun, were circulated by him among his university acquaintance for several years, providing Mary with an opportunity to engage Oxford dons on topics that included theatre and literature (see Harris, &#145;Living in the neighbourhood of science&#146;, 208; Harris, &#145;Letterbooks&#146;, 210&#150;14). <br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_68254"></a><span class="headword">Mary Evelyn</span>  (1665&#150;1685), the sixth of eight children born to John and Mary Evelyn, is credited with authorship of <span class="italic">Mundus muliebris</span>, a brief satire in tetrameter couplets on fashionable women's clothing, accoutrements, and behaviour, first published in 1690. Sole attribution of the piece to her is questionable: de Beer points out that the one reference to the work in her father's diary may suggest that she contributed to rather than wrote it (see Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.423; Nevinson, 5&#150;12; Greer and others, 324). Other writings in Mary Evelyn's hand survive; these are primarily religious meditations and rules for her own conduct. She was dutiful and devout, playful and pious, and her death at the age of nineteen grieved her family deeply. She spent most of her short life at the family home at Sayes Court, Deptford. She studied French and Italian, history and literature, music and dancing. After her death her father eulogized her in his diary: &#145;The justnesse of her stature, person, comelinesse of her Countenance and gracefullnesse of motion, naturall, &amp; unaffected (though more than ordinaryly beautifull), was &hellip; of the least, compar'd with the Ornaments of her mind&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.421). Her mother described her to a correspondent: &#145;The papers which are found in her cabinet discover she profited by her readying&#151;such reflections, collections out of Scripture, confessions, meditations, and pious notions, evidence her time was not spent in the trifling way of most young women&#146;  (H. Evelyn, 107). Another important role model was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10880/', "Margaret Godolphin (1652&#150;1678)")</script>, a family friend with whom Mary's father signed a pact of friendship using a symbol that Mary was to adapt in her own journal  (Evelyn papers, MS ME 13). During an extended visit to Rebecca, Viscountess Falkland, in late 1684 and early 1685 Mary was exposed to smallpox. She returned to Sayes Court, where she fell ill, and died on 14 March 1685. She was buried on 17 March in St Nicholas's Church, Deptford.<br>
