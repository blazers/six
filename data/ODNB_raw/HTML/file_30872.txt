<span class="headword">Bullock, Sir  Christopher Llewellyn</span>  (1891&#150;1972), <span class="occ">public servant and businessman</span>, was born on 10 November 1891 at Whiston, Northamptonshire, the second child and second son in the family of seven children (one of whom died at birth) of the Revd Llewellyn Christopher Watson Bullock (1866&#150;1936), later rector of Great and Little Wigborough, Essex, and his wife, Cecil Augusta Margaret Isabella, daughter of Edmund Robert Spearman CMG, British consul in Chantilly and formerly secretary of the Public Works Loan Board, and granddaughter of the fifth earl of Orkney. He was educated at Rugby School, where his father was a master, becoming captain of the running eight and gaining a classical scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he had a remarkable career. He won not only the Abbott and Porson university scholarships in classics, the members' Latin essay prize, and the Browne medals for Latin ode (twice) and Greek epigram, but also the Charles Oldham Shakespeare scholarship and the Whewell scholarship in international law. He was placed in the first division of the first class of the classical tripos in 1913 and was offered a fellowship at Trinity.<br>
<br>It was, however, to the public service that Bullock turned. After taking first place in the open competition for the home and Indian Civil Services in 1914 he chose India. But the First World War intervened before he took up his appointment and he volunteered for service with the rifle brigade. He was seriously wounded at Ypres in 1915 and was mentioned in dispatches; later, seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, he gained his wings first as an observer and then as a pilot. Becoming unfit for flying in 1917, he was appointed to the air staff and, in 1919, became principal private secretary to Winston Churchill, the secretary of state for air. From 1923 to 1930 he served successive secretaries of state in the same capacity and in 1931, at the exceptionally early age of thirty-nine, he was promoted directly to permanent secretary of the Air Ministry and member of the Air Council.<br>
<br>It was at the Air Ministry that Bullock's best work was done. In 1919 the government had decided to establish a permanent independent Royal Air Force and Sir Hugh Trenchard was given the task of creating and building up the new service. Bullock became his right-hand man on the civilian side and Trenchard, when he retired in 1929, recorded his gratitude for Bullock's great contribution during what he called &#145;the hardest years that I think any Department could pass through&#146;. For there were forces in Whitehall, particularly in the other service departments and in the Treasury, that were hostile to the young Royal Air Force and its very survival as a separate service was at times in doubt. Bullock fought with partisan ferocity for the interests of his ministry and it was in this testing atmosphere that his administrative temperament was forged.<br>
<br>Later the rising menace of Nazism made the expansion of the RAF a concern of first importance, and Bullock's part was again crucial. Against the pacific temper and financial stringency of the times he strove to awaken public and parliament to the need for strengthening the RAF to meet the dangers ahead. His powerful intellect and superb administrative skills were harnessed unstintingly to the task and he drafted nearly all of the important air staff papers for the cabinet himself. It was during these critical years that decisions were taken in the Air Ministry that were vital to Britain's air defence capability when war finally came. Bullock also made a major contribution during the 1920s and 1930s to developing civil aviation, in particular to the pioneering empire air mail scheme.<br>
<br>Bullock had a strong personality, and once embarked upon a course in which he believed was not easily turned aside. Viscount Templewood thought him &#145;combative by nature&#146; and elsewhere he was described as &#145;a fluent talker and not always a patient listener&#146; (Templewood, 51; Stephen Roskill, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 May 1972). In the bitter interdepartmental battles of the day he conveyed &#145;a high degree of arrogance&#146; and undoubtedly made enemies  (Dean, 89). This told heavily against him when, in 1936, he became the subject of a board of inquiry, appointed by the prime minister, following allegations that he had misused his official position by writing to the chairman of Imperial Airways about the possibility of joining the board of the company should he retire prematurely from the civil service. The approach was made when the Air Ministry was still negotiating with the company about the empire air mail scheme, and a <span class="italic">Times</span> leader was strongly critical of Bullock. As a result of the inquiry the prime minister approved summary dismissal, though Stanley Baldwin later wrote that, had he known the whole story, he would never have done so. And Bullock's chief, Lord Hankey, wrote in November 1937: &#145;the more I think of it the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime&#146;  (Roskill, <span class="italic">Hankey</span>, 3.360). The injustice done to Bullock was implicitly recognized during the Second World War, when Bullock was invited to resume a permanent secretary's appointment in the civil service, an offer that he declined because of existing commitments in industries connected with vital war work. Public acknowledgement that his dismissal had been mistaken was belatedly made at his memorial service. It was attended by a representative of the prime minister, members of the air force board, and the permanent under-secretary of the Ministry of Defence.<br>
<br>After 1936 Bullock showed great fortitude in developing a range of business interests, becoming a director of a number of well-known companies; he remained active in business until his late seventies. He married, on 18 April 1917, Barbara May, daughter of Henry Lupton, a stuff merchant in Leeds, and they had two sons, both of whom enjoyed successful careers in the public service.<br>
<br>Bullock was appointed OBE in 1919, CBE in 1926, CB in 1929, and KCB in 1932. He died in London on 16 May 1972.<br>
