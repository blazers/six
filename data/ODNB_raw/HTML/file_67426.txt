<span class="headword">Crespin,  Paul Daniel</span>  (1693/4&#150;1770), <span class="occ">goldsmith</span>, was born in London, the son of the Huguenot Daniel Crespin of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Westminster. In June 1713, at the late age of nineteen, Paul Crespin was apprenticed to Jean Pons, goldsmith. Between July 1720 and December 1721 he entered his first two marks at Goldsmiths' Hall as a freeman of the Longbowstringmakers' Company. He was working in Compton Street, Soho, London, at the sign of the Golden Ball. In the 1720s Crespin married Margaret (Mary) Branboeuf; by 1743 they had five children.<br>
<br>Crespin's mature apprenticeship explains the high quality of his earliest work. A 1721 cruet set (Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia) reveals his mastery of the different goldsmiths' skills. The octagonal cruets have pierced covers; their sides are chased with flowers, fruit, and birds; their handles are formed of cast figures of harpies. The stand has a finely chased border.<br>
<br>In 1724 Crespin received an order for a silver bath for King Jo&atilde;o V of Portugal. This important commission may have come through his younger brother, who was royal goldsmith in Lisbon. A contemporary described the full-size bath as supported on three dolphins, their tails curling up around the outside surface, while inside three mermaids' bodies followed the curve of the tub. The two sides were decorated with scenes of Diana bathing and Perseus and Andromeda. Weighing 6030 ounces, the bath was shown at Kensington Palace to George I, &#145;who was well pleased with so curious a Piece of Workmanship, which can scarcely be match'd in all Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span>, July 1724). It was destined for the royal palace, Lisbon, but was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake. An unusually large circular basin of 1722 (BM) may have been associated with this commission and used as a footbath.<br>
<br>In 1726 Crespin contributed to a large service for Empress Catherine I of Russia a silver-gilt cup and cover (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg). Such important royal commissions attracted noble clients. These included Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, for whom Crespin made a large sideboard dish with applied profile medallions of classical philosophers (1727). Charles, third duke of Marlborough, commissioned a pair of silver-gilt wine coolers in 1733. Their shape, the faun supporters, and the wave ornament on the base are influenced by contemporary French silver. Crespin's landlord in Soho, the second duke of Portland, ordered large quantities of table silver. A manuscript list of plate supplied by Crespin to Viscount Townsend between 1740 and 1759 illustrates the range of his stock.<br>
<br>Silver centrepieces and tureens provided the most appropriate vehicles for Crespin's mastery of the craft. A tureen and stand made for Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset, in 1740 (Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio) is supported by recumbent figures of hinds and the cover is decorated with grapes, plums, apples, and pears. The design is close to the centrepiece (V&amp;A) made for John, second earl of Ashburnham, by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53779/', "Nicholas Sprimont (bap. 1715, d. 1771)")</script>. The elaborate marine silver-gilt centrepiece (1741), bearing Crespin's mark, made for Frederick, prince of Wales, may have been produced in collaboration with Sprimont. The wave ornament, supporting mermen, and presiding figure of Neptune recall the Portuguese royal bath and the Marlborough wine coolers.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">General Advertiser</span> declared Crespin's bankruptcy in 1747, the year in which Nicholas Sprimont left the goldsmiths' trade to concentrate on the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory. Crespin's stock intended for the export market was sold by the auctioneer John Heath. It consisted of gold and silver toys, snuff boxes, &eacute;tuis, watches, jewels, and rings. Crespin's second son, Elias David, educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, and Caius College, Cambridge, was ordained and became dean of Guernsey in 1765. His eldest daughter Magdalen (1729&#150;1795) married the Huguenot watchmaker Francis Barraud (1727&#150;1795) of St Andrew's Street, Seven Dials, London.<br>
<br>In the 1760s Paul Crespin retired to Southampton, where he died in 1770. He was survived by his wife, who was dead by April 1775. A portrait of Crespin (<i>c</i>.1730; V&amp;A) descended in the Barraud family.<br>
