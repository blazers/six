<span class="headword">Rue,  Warren  de la</span>  (1815&#150;1889), <span class="occ">chemist and astronomer</span>, was born on 18 January 1815 in Guernsey, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7446/', "Thomas de la Rue (1793&#150;1866)")</script>, printer, and his wife, Jane Warren (1789&#150;1858) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64905/', "Rue, de la, family")</script>]. The family moved to London not long after his birth, but he was subsequently sent to the Coll&egrave;ge de Ste Barbe in Paris to be educated. He returned to London in his teens and entered his father's business, which, by this time, was establishing itself as a major producer of stationery. He followed his father in being interested in technical innovation, and studied privately relevant areas of science, more especially chemistry. On 17 February 1840 de la Rue married Georgiana (1819&#150;1918), the third daughter of Thomas Bowles from Guernsey. They had four sons and one daughter.<h2>
<a name="Successfulchemistry18361850"></a>Successful chemistry, 1836&#150;1850</h2>De la Rue's paper relating to the chemistry of electric batteries (a lifelong interest) appeared in 1836. The work derived from his concern for the use of electrotypes in printing, a process which he was one of the first to introduce on a large scale. In 1845, when the Royal College of Chemistry was founded in London by the German chemist, August Wilhelm Hofmann, de la Rue became one of the first to study there. Besides meeting a number of future leaders of British chemistry at the college, he became a close friend of Hofmann himself, and helped him edit chemical translations from the German. De la Rue's scientific work benefited from skills developed as part of his business activities. Good draughtsmanship was one example. Another was mechanical aptitude. On the business side, this led him to invent, along with Edwin Hill, the first envelope making machine, which became one of the exhibits at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Both de la Rue and his father were jury members at the exhibition, and for the former his involvement proved highly significant both in terms of business and of science. On the business side, de la Rue became interested in another of the exhibits&#151;a patent candle. He subsequently carried out chemical studies which led to improvements in this product. For this he received a substantial payment from its manufacturers. In 1850 de la Rue's scientific activities were recognized by his election to the Royal Society.<h2>
<a name="Astronomy"></a>Astronomy</h2>Though de la Rue carried out a number of investigations into organic chemistry in the latter part of the 1850s and the early 1860s, his research time was increasingly taken up by astronomy. In 1840 he came into contact with James Nasmyth, a successful engineer, who had developed an interest in astronomy and, more especially, in the construction of an altazimuth reflecting telescope. He inspired de la Rue and cast two speculum mirrors for him; de la Rue developed his own methods for figuring and polishing them. Nasmyth was in close contact with another wealthy amateur astronomer, William Lassell, who not only provided de la Rue with additional suggestions for polishing mirrors, but also pointed out to him the value of equatorial mountings for reflecting telescopes. The major outcome of all this advice was that by 1849 de la Rue had constructed a 13 inch equatorial reflector which he installed in a small observatory at his home in Canonbury, Middlesex, and used for a number of studies in subsequent years. Lassell's interest in Saturn also communicated itself to de la Rue. His first astronomical publication for the Royal Astronomical Society was based on a drawing he made of that planet which showed its newly discovered inner ring.<br>
<br>At the Great Exhibition de la Rue saw daguerreotypes of the moon sent from Harvard College observatory. Astronomical photography had an immediate appeal for him, combining as it did his interests in chemistry, astronomy, and instrumentation. The timing was also propitious. The daguerreotype process was slow and inconvenient, and the plates were unable to record faint objects. In 1851 a new wet collodion process was brought into use. As the name suggests, this entailed exposing plates immediately after they had been sensitized by chemical immersion. Though the plates were not entirely convenient to handle this allowed much fainter details to be recorded. De la Rue applied the new process to taking pictures of the moon, obtained several useful images, and enlarged them. However, his telescope had to be accurately guided by hand during exposures, and this proved to be difficult.<br>
<br>In 1857 de la Rue moved from Canonbury to Cranford, Middlesex, where he remounted his telescope with a mechanical drive. He soon produced not only better pictures of the moon, but also photographs of Jupiter, Saturn, and a bright double star. One important result to emerge was the extent to which the photographic images of the moon and planets differed from their visual appearances. Since the photographic plates were more sensitive to blue light than the human eye, these differences indicated variations in colour. De la Rue further realized that the moon could be photographed from slightly different angles as it pursued its path round the earth. This allowed him to combine photographs taken at different times to provide the first stereoscopic pictures of an astronomical body. Like his earlier work on telescope making, this new advance was warmly praised by the leading British scientist Sir John Herschel.<br>
<br>The observatory at Kew had come under the control of the British Association in the 1840s, and Herschel suggested that it should be used to obtain daily photographs of the sun. De la Rue was the obvious person to consult on this matter, so the Kew committee of the British Association asked him to examine the requirements for constructing a photo-heliograph. Funds for the construction were provided by the Royal Society. De la Rue inaugurated the new instrument at Kew in 1858, where it remained in operation&#151;with a short period at de la Rue's own observatory&#151;until 1872. In 1859 Balfour Stewart was appointed to take charge of the Kew observatory. Over the next few years de la Rue, Balfour Stewart, and the assistant at the observatory, Benjamin Loewy, were involved in an intensive series of solar studies.<br>
<br>In 1860 de la Rue took the photo-heliograph to Spain where a total solar eclipse was visible. His photographs played an important part in demonstrating that prominences were undoubtedly genuine features hovering above the sun's surface. De la Rue described this work in his Bakerian lecture to the Royal Society in 1862. Meanwhile, in 1861, he applied his stereoscopic methods to photographs of the sun. The results, along with other observations at Kew, supported the suggestion made by Alexander Wilson in the eighteenth century that sunspots represent depressions in the solar surface. It also appeared that the bright solar faculae occupied positions above, and often behind, the sunspots as the sun rotated. These observations were important for current discussions of the sun and its atmosphere. However, the main reasons for obtaining frequent photographs of the sun were twofold: to investigate in more detail the solar cycle, discovered by the German amateur astronomer, Heinrich Schwabe in the 1840s, and to relate this to the solar&#150;terrestrial interaction affecting the earth's magnetic field, detected in the early 1850s by Edward Sabine. The Kew studies, which covered an entire solar cycle, provided the best statistical data on sunspots then available, and were used to examine the variations in spot numbers in considerable detail. More speculatively, de la Rue and his colleagues tried to relate the incidence of sunspots to the motions of the planets.<br>
<br>Balfour Stewart resigned from Kew in 1871. De la Rue's photo-heliograph was transferred to the Royal Observatory, beginning its operations there in 1873 (though it returned to Kew a few years later). Nevertheless, in November 1872 de la Rue withdrew from the Royal Astronomical Society council because of their deference to Airy's opposition to an independent solar observatory. However, de la Rue continued to be involved in the Kew observatory until his death. With the departure of the photo-heliograph he started preparing for the forthcoming transit of Venus in 1874 but, his eyesight a problem, he finally decided he was no longer fit enough to carry out intensive astronomical observations. In 1873, having heard from Charles Pritchard that Oxford University was to fund a new observatory, he offered his telescope and other equipment on the understanding that it would be installed and used. By this he became co-founder of the new observatory, and a vital benefactor of it, and so maintained his interest in observational astronomy at Oxford. In 1887 he paid for a photographic refractor so that the observatory could participate in the new international <i>carte du ciel</i> project.<h2>
<a name="Latechemistry"></a>Late chemistry</h2>In 1873 de la Rue moved house to Portland Place in central London. Here he reverted to his chemical interests, setting up a laboratory in which he and his friend, Hugo M&uuml;ller, carried out a series of investigations. M&uuml;ller had worked with him earlier on organic chemistry, but by the end of the 1860s they had turned their attention to the study of electrical discharges through gases. De la Rue's interest in them may well have stemmed from Balfour Stewart, who suggested that aurorae, one of the phenomena affected by solar&#150;terrestrial interaction, might be electrical discharges. The topic of discharges became increasingly important as the century progressed, and de la Rue continued working on it until a few years before his death. To obtain the voltage required, he returned to his development of electrical batteries. By the time he finished his experiments he was using a battery containing 15,000 cells. One of the key figures in understanding discharges, J. J. Thomson, subsequently declared that de la Rue and M&uuml;ller had taken some of the best photographs of striated discharges ever made. Unfortunately, a proper understanding of the discharge phenomenon, and hence of the photographs, came only after de la Rue's death.<h2>
<a name="Publiclife"></a>Public life</h2>De la Rue was one of the wealthy amateurs who played a vital role in nineteenth-century British science. In part this was by direct donation. Apart from his interest in Oxford he offered financial support for other scientific enterprises. One example was the expedition by David Gill in 1877 to Ascension Island in order to make a new determination of the sun's distance. Equally, de la Rue devoted a good deal of his time to the organization of science. In terms of his two main concerns&#151;chemistry and astronomy&#151;he was, in the former field, a founder member of the Chemical Society and its president from 1867 to 1869 and in 1879&#150;80. In astronomy he was an honorary secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1855 to 1862, president from 1864 to 1866 and a member of its council for most of the time from 1866 until his death. He was also president of the London Institution for many years, retiring from this position in 1878, when he became secretary of the Royal Institution. He was much in demand as a committee member throughout his life, for he was regarded as tactful, kindly, and generous.<br>
<br>Many honours came to de la Rue from both home and abroad. He was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1862, a royal medal of the Royal Society in 1864, and the prix Lalande of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences in 1865. He was a corresponding member of a number of foreign societies, but his closest ties were with Paris, which he continued to visit throughout his life. Like his father before him, he was appointed to the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>Having worked in the family business all his life de la Rue became head of the firm on his father's death in 1866. He tried to retire in 1869, but was forced to return in the following year on the death of his brother. He finally retired in 1880, when the business activities devolved on his sons. He suffered from poor health in his later years, which curtailed his activities. Following a bout of pneumonia he died at 73 Portland Place, Marylebone, London, on 19 April 1889. He was survived by his wife.<br>
