<span class="headword">Morton, Sir  James</span>  (1867&#150;1943), <span class="occ">textile and dyestuffs manufacturer</span>, was born on 24 March 1867, at Darvel, Ayrshire, the third of nine children in the family of Alexander Morton (1844&#150;1923) and his wife, Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wiseman (1844/5&#150;1924). Alexander (1844&#150;1923), of hand-loom weaving stock, was the leading entrepreneur in the factory production of lace, mainly for curtains. He had also pioneered direct selling to retailers and diversified into heavier decorative materials, including machine-made carpets. James was educated at Darvel School and Ayr Academy before joining the firm as an apprentice at the age of sixteen. The firm's success depended on the application of the most modern technology, especially Nottingham lace machinery, and the lowest regional labour costs and unionization in the industry. There was also a strong commitment to stylish designs.<br>
<br>Several of Alexander Morton's sons and relatives were employed by the firm, and by 1895 they were trying to obtain control. James, his brother Gavin, and his cousin Guy became the executive partners, and Alexander assumed the chairmanship, and increasingly turned to hackney horse and pansy breeding and fruit-growing, finally settling in Donegal (1909). By 1895 the firm's annual turnover was &pound;89,000; nearly half this turnover comprised lace and madras, a quarter carpets, and slightly over a quarter tapestry and chenille. Expansion could not be sustained locally because of the scarcity and increasing cost of labour; therefore the firm built a large factory at Carlisle and three carpet factories in Donegal aided by the Irish congested districts board. This expansion was funded by a preference share issue and bank overdrafts.<br>
<br>James Morton's interest in colour and fashion was stimulated by the Arts and Crafts movement associated with William Morris and the Pre-Raphaelites, and was reinforced by his marriage on 21 March 1901 to Beatrice Emily Fagan (1871&#150;1958), an art teacher trained by Charlotte Mason. In 1902 he was disturbed to find that one of his firm's fabrics, which he had coloured, faded badly after only a week in the windows of Liberty's of London, and he spent the next three years trying to improve colour fastness. His work with John Christie of United Turkey Red led to the production of new fast dyes, and in 1905 the first Morton fabrics were sold with guaranteed replacement if they faded. These fabrics, mostly produced at Carlisle, were advertised under the brand name Sundour (dour in Gaelic means water; in Scots, stubborn, hard to move). Within four years Sundour materials accounted for half the firm's annual profits of &pound;16,500, and within seven years three times the profit produced from other output. In 1913 Morton decided to split the firm into two companies: Alexander Morton &amp; Co., which concentrated on lace at Darvel and employed nearly 600 people, and Morton Sundour Fabrics Limited, producing other fabrics at Carlisle. While his father remained chairman of both companies, James Morton became managing director and majority shareholder of Sundour.<br>
<br>Most of the dyes used by Sundour were manufactured in Germany, and when war began in 1914, only five months' supplies were in stock; Morton sought alternative sources, and a chemical plant was built and put into operation to supply his firm's requirements before the German stock was exhausted. By 1918 dyestuffs were being produced to supply other companies; this led to the establishment of Solway Dyes Limited, a subsidiary which also licensed American producers. Morton recognized the demand opportunities, and also the potentiality for further research, and therefore established Scottish Dyes Limited at Grangemouth (1919) with a capital of &pound;300,000, about half of which was raised outside the firm. There followed the discovery of Caledon Jade Green, the fastest dyestuff so far produced; German producers, previously world leaders, had to apply for licences to produce it.<br>
<br>In 1923 Morton sold Scottish Dyes to the British Dyestuffs Corporation, later part of Imperial Chemical Industries. His talents were recognized by ICI, where he served on the dyestuffs division board from 1926 until his death. Morton received a knighthood in 1936 for services to the dye and colour industries.<br>
<br>After selling Scottish Dyes, Morton tried to improve production by seeking to replace the shuttle and loom, and succeeded in combining an innovation in warp-knitting technique with a new method of inserting continuous wefts. By 1935 prototypes (called by Morton &#145;fly-needle frames&#146;) were operational and demonstrated to Samuel Courtauld (1876&#150;1947). A joint company (FNF Limited) was established: Courtaulds took 60 per cent of the shares and provided the working capital and also paid &pound;250,000 for a quarter of the equity in Morton Sundour Fabrics; Morton Sundour took the remaining 40 per cent. FNF did not live up to the expectations of Courtauld and Morton in their lifetimes, but in 1944 an improved device ran at more than three times the speed of the normal warp-knitting machine in a demonstration to the trade. By the 1950s it was being sold worldwide. Morton's association with Courtauld reflected his firm's problems in the depression of the 1930s; profits were slow to recover and research and development were expensive; he lost his chief commercial executive to a rival, and needed time to blood a successor. In the late 1930s he was joined by his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40349/', "Alastair James Fagan Morton")</script>, who became a great designer, and by his son-in-law, Lieutenant-Commander R. S. E. Hannay, as production manager.<br>
<br>Brought up in a sabbatarian and teetotal home, Morton was a conscientious member of the Church of Scotland, and reared his family of six children according to his beliefs. He was interested throughout his life in art and design, serving during the First World War on a Ministry of Reconstruction committee on adult education, and helping in the formation of the Design and Industries Association. He was an active member of the Royal Society of Arts and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1923 he became the first recipient of the gold medal awarded to celebrate the Faraday benzene centenary. He died on 22 August 1943 at his home, Dalston Hall, near Carlisle; his wife died on 20 April 1958.<br>
