<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tonge,  Israel</span>  (1621&#150;1680), <span class="occ">informer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Tickhill, near Doncaster, on 11 November 1621, the son of Henry Tong of Holtby, Yorkshire, the minister of that parish. Tonge was educated locally in Doncaster until he went to University College, Oxford, on 3 May 1639. He graduated BA (14 March 1643), proceeding MA (6 July 1648). Tonge claimed that he did not wish to bear arms against the king, and on the outbreak of the civil war he retired to the country to become a schoolmaster at Churchill in Oxfordshire. It was there that he honed his teaching skills that were later to be so much admired by John Aubrey. Aubrey stated that Tonge had adopted, with no sense of irony considering Tonge's later career, the Jesuit methods of teaching, and added to them his own pictorial method of teaching using drawings and Latin verse, breaking up the teaching into two-hour sessions with play for the boys in between. Tonge may also have begun his interest in gardening, alchemy, and chemistry at this time. Aubrey claimed that at his death Tonge left &#145;two manuscript tomes in folio of alchymie [and that his] excellency lay there&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.261&#150;2). Tonge was also said to have left numerous manuscripts on chemistry, which were subsequently lost.<h2>
<a name="CivilwarandRestoration"></a>Civil war and Restoration</h2>In 1678 Tonge was to claim that he had been &#145;in armes with &amp; for his Majestie in Oxfordshire, took the Oxfordshire oath or anticovenant, [and] continued all the warre in his majesties quarter&#146;  (Tonge, 44). With the close of the first civil war, however, Tonge returned to the university and became a fellow there. In 1649, seeking both marriage and a rectory, he obtained both from Edward Simpson, the rector of Pluckley in Kent, whose daughter, Jane, he married that year. In 1656 Tonge was made a doctor of theology, and in 1657, following the birth of his son, Simpson, he took up a fellowship at the newly constituted Cromwellian College at Durham. There he taught grammar until its closure in 1659. With the Restoration, Tonge was forced to seek other outlets for his talents. He briefly returned to schoolmastering in Islington at an academy for girls, but in 1660, through the assistance of his &#145;honoured patron&#146;, Colonel Edward Harley, Tonge became a chaplain to the garrison at Dunkirk  (BL, Add. MS 4365, fol. 24). When Dunkirk was sold to the French in 1661 Tonge obtained further ecclesiastical preferment from Harley at Leintwardine in Herefordshire. On 26 June 1666 he was given the rectory of St Mary Stayning in London, but this burnt down during the great fire of London, and with this catastrophe his mind appears to have become permanently disturbed.<br>
<br>Tonge became obsessive about the Jesuits, whom he blamed for his own losses as well as those of the nation. In his anti-papal fervour he was somewhat extreme, although many of his ideas were perhaps more typical of the English of the day than historians once believed. While homeless, Tonge took a position as chaplain to the garrison at Tangier. It was claimed by some that Tonge was finally expelled from Tangier after two years because he sowed &#145;discord in the garrison&#146;  (Warner, 1.193). Whatever the truth of this, on his return to England Tonge became rector at St Michael's, Wood Street, London, which he subsequently held jointly with a rectory at Aston in Herefordshire from 1672 to 1677.<h2>
<a name="IntroducedtoOates"></a>Introduced to Oates</h2>In 1675 Tonge fell in with Sir Richard Barker and his wife; Barker, a physician who was violently anti-Catholic, became his mentor. Tonge himself noted that he was very hospitably received into &#145;theire family where he continued &amp; had of the knight, besides his diet and lodging, considerable summes of mon[e]y &amp; other great encouragements in his studies&#146;  (Tonge, 1). These studies were anti-Catholic, and as a result Barker gave Tonge the rectory at &#145;Avon Dossett&#146; (Avon Dassett in Warwickshire), although Tonge was to claim that &#145;illegall practices&#146; prevented him taking the post  (ibid.). This only added to Tonge's already growing paranoia and fear of the Jesuits over these years. Barker also became a patron of Samuel Oates and his son Titus about this time, and it was at Barker's home in the Barbican in London in 1677 that Israel Tonge met Titus Oates for the first time. Tonge became a useful sounding board for Oates to exercise his prejudices, as well as a source of money. By now Tonge, although supremely convinced of his own literary abilities, believed that a Jesuit plot, mainly centred around his translation of a work by Nicolas Perrault (published in 1679 as <span class="italic">The Jesuits Morals</span>), prevented him from publishing his work. As he continued to strive against publishers, plotters, and their agents Tonge claimed he could obtain &#145;neither &hellip; favour or right in any cause he had in hand for his support &amp; settlement&#146;  (ibid., 3). Together with Oates he now planned to write a series of pamphlets against the Catholics, but his co-author, after agreeing, promptly disappeared to France. How much Tonge was aware of Oates's actual activities at the English College at St Omer, or indeed encouraged them, is now difficult to say. Tonge later claimed that he had encouraged Oates to go to St Omer to learn more about Jesuit intrigue, while others maintained that it was really Tonge and not Oates who lay behind the construction of the plot, but at the time Tonge was merely puzzled by Oates's disappearance. Moreover there seems little doubt that Tonge remained throughout the weaker character in the partnership.<br>
<br>Oates's final failure at St Omer and his expulsion from the college eventually brought him back to London in July 1678. Once there he enthralled Tonge with tales of Jesuit intrigue and his own daring actions in tormenting the Catholics in their very den. Indeed he pandered to Tonge's vanity by claiming that he had been sent back to kill the feared author of the (then unpublished) &#145;Jesuits morals&#146; for &pound;50, that there had actually been a popish plot since 1639, and it &#145;still held on &amp; [was] generally true according to what Dr Tonge had described it in his &hellip; booke of the <span class="roman">Royall Martyr</span>&#146;  (Tonge, 5). A suitably flattered Tonge subsequently demanded that Oates write down all he knew of the plot. In the meantime Tonge had moved into William Lambert's house at Vauxhall with Christopher Kirkby, a former assistant in Charles II's scientific experiments. Kirkby had bragged that he had access to the king. This was unfortunate, for it was at this time that Oates, still claiming to be fearful of his life, finally consented to give a copy of the forty-three articles detailing the plot and a number of assassination attempts allegedly made upon Charles II to Tonge. To give added mystery to the affair Oates agreed to leave them behind the wainscot in Barker's house. By 12 August 1678 Tonge had retranscribed the articles and was keen to give a copy to Charles II. Tonge told Kirkby of the articles and the plot, and Kirkby agreed to approach the king. On 13 August 1678 Kirkby finally warned Charles II of the threat to his life, and on the same day both Tonge and Kirkby had an interview with the king. Charles II subsequently left the investigation to his first minister, the earl of Danby, and seems never to have believed the story related by either Tonge or Oates.<h2>
<a name="Revealingtheplot"></a>Revealing the plot</h2>At this point Tonge was keen to keep Oates's name secret, and throughout Danby's investigations into the plot Tonge remained reluctant to expose his source. Instead, Tonge, with his sense of self-importance, sought to make himself the middleman between Oates and the government. Both Oates, still unwilling to reveal himself, and Danby agreed to this for a time, but Danby soon tired of the intrigue. Suspecting Tonge was merely mad, and after six weeks unable to come to the real intelligencer, he began to see the plot as nonsense. Others learning of Tonge's comings and goings began to agree. Gilbert Burnet claimed that Tonge approached him with news of the plot, and when he afterwards enquired at the secretary of state's office they dismissed Tonge as a man only &#145;making discoveries &hellip; [in the hope that he would] get himself to be made a dean&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.156). At this point the conspirators began to fear that Danby would drop them altogether, and so Oates chose to invent some actual correspondence to sustain the plot. These crude forgeries, with their &#145;ill spelling of names, and other suspitious marks&#146;, were then sent to Father Bedingfield, the duke of York's confessor, at Windsor  (TNA: PRO, PC2/66, 392). They detailed more of the plot, although instead of being intercepted by Danby at the Post Office as had originally been planned, the letters actually reached a puzzled Bedingfield, who promptly took them to the duke of York. James now demanded an investigation, the very thing Tonge had actually wished for, and it was this that ultimately brought the Popish Plot into the public domain.<br>
<br>Tonge, who remained unaware of the investigation, was fearful that Oates would fly from the imaginary assassins he now claimed were pursuing him. As a result Tonge continued to seek further ways to bring the plot to public notice. Initially Tonge brought Oates to the home of Sir Joseph Williamson, the secretary of state, in order to get Oates's testimony sworn before a legal authority; Williamson, however, snubbed the pair. Tonge &#145;at a losse &hellip; advised with some very honourable friends about such a Justice as he might trust with soe weighty a business. They after some consideracion com[m]ended Sir Edmond Bury Godfrey&#146; to him  (Tonge, 35). This act was, indirectly, to lead to Godfrey's own mysterious death in September 1678. Ironically, on the same day as Oates swore his second oath before a sceptical Godfrey, Tonge was himself brought before the privy council to relate his tale. While the councillors remained merely amused at Tonge's rambling statements, they were considerably more impressed when Oates himself came before them and narrated his story with growing confidence. Oates, rather than Tonge, now became the &#145;saviour of the nation&#146;, and it was Oates who consequently took the main reward for revealing his spurious plot.<br>
<br>Although Tonge was afterwards lodged in Whitehall and given a pension suitable to his needs as the man &#145;to whose memory the nation is not a little indebted&#146;, his role in the crisis that unfolded was considerably less than that of Oates  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 106). Tonge went before the House of Commons a number of times and was commended for his part in discovering the plot, but he had neither Oates's abilities as a liar or his partner's brazen nature to carry him further. As a result little reward came Tonge's way. His attempt to oust Obadiah Walker from the mastership of University College on the grounds of Catholicism did succeed, but Tonge did not, as he had planned, occupy the place in his stead. Instead he was finally allowed to print his rambling pamphlets on the plot, and these later works show some of the increasing inanities concerning Catholicism that he now inflicted on his readers. The works that most explain his thought include <span class="italic">Jesuits Assassins</span> (1680), in which Tonge tried his hand at anagrams and verse, alongside a history of the cruelties of the Jesuits. In the <span class="italic">New Design of Papists Detected</span> (1679) he argued that the Jesuits only protested their innocence because in the Catholic sense &#145;the Crime they suffered for were no Treason, because the King was deposed by the Pope [their master] and consequently, so far from needing a Pardon &hellip; [their actions] were a matter of merit&#146;  (Tonge, 6). The oddest of Tonge's works, however, remains <span class="italic">The Northern Star</span> (1680), a collection of prophecies &#145;collected out of my slender stock&#146; and designed as &#145;Paper-Bullets in my Countrymen's Mouths&#146;  (sig. B2<i>r</i>). These pamphlets have little merit in general. Tonge's prose style, where it was not manic, remained turgid and generally unreadable. He tended to regurgitate earlier authors on the Jesuit menace and confirm both his and his readers' abiding prejudice against papists. To many contemporaries, Tonge's prose seems to have become even more muddled than his mind.<h2>
<a name="Finalmonths"></a>Final months</h2>At length Oates stole his former mentor's glory, while the elder man was pushed to one side. The arrival of William Bedloe and Miles Prance, among a multitude of other informers, left Tonge with only a minor role to play. For a time he seems to have become completely intoxicated by the general public acceptance of his long-held beliefs in a Jesuit plot. Bishop Burnet, visiting Tonge in Whitehall, found him &#145;so lifted up, that he seems to have lost the little sense he had&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.162). In 1679, however, Tonge quarrelled with Oates and came, it was said, to have a very bad opinion of his erstwhile prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Tonge subsequently withdrew from association with Oates. As a result, although he appeared before the House of Commons on 21 March 1679 to relate his part in the discovery of the plot and retained his genuine belief that he would have been one of its main victims, no one required him to be a witness in the trials that followed Oates's revelations, and he was left to wallow in his literary efforts.<br>
<br>The activities of his son, Simpson, whom his father had abandoned in Simpson's youth because of his debauchery and his attempt to join the Catholic church, also distressed Tonge and left him &#145;Ruined in my name and reputation&#146;  (Stowe MS 746, fol. 40). Simpson Tonge was to claim in August 1680 that his father and Oates had concocted the plot between them, but his assertions were discounted mainly because of his own blatant inability to tell the truth. Following the misfiring of his accusations that Sir Edward Dering had corresponded with the papal nuncio Tonge became subject to a &#145;very dangerous sicknesse [and] deserted of all&#146; in November 1680  (ibid., fol. 40). He died, &#145;sunk in my disease&#146;, at the home of Stephen College, the protestant agitator and pamphleteer, near Bridewell Ditch, London, on 18 December 1680; he was aged fifty-nine  (ibid.). Tonge was buried in the churchyard of his former parish, St Mary Stayning, on 23 December 1680.<br>
<br>It was said that Israel Tonge still persisted on his deathbed in his belief of the plot's truthfulness as well as his own integrity in its discovery. This belief was likely to have been genuine, as he remained yet another dupe of Oates and besotted by ideas of Jesuit conspiracy. His brother John, who was a captain in the army, quickly seized control of the doctor's papers after his death, including his journal, and most of these documents fell into the hands of the government. They reveal that in the early stages of the plot Tonge had an almost blind faith in Oates's revelations and maintained enough of his egotism to claim that both he and his literary endeavours were central to the Popish Plot.<br>
