</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Procter,  Bryan Waller</span>  (1787&#150;1874), <span class="occ">poet and lawyer</span>, the eldest child of Nicholas Procter (<i>d</i>. 1816) and his wife, Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1837), was born on 21 November 1787 and named after a great-uncle from whom an inheritance was expected. His ancestors were small farmers in Yorkshire or Cumberland, but his father moved to London and set up in trade. He may have been the Nicholas Procter who dealt in wine and brandy at 241 Piccadilly between 1799 and 1804; he was certainly a man of leisure and property when he died in 1816 at Gloucester Place, Camden Town. The Procters' other children were Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or before 1867) and Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 1802), who inherited the landed estate in Yorkshire of their great-uncle Bryan Waller and changed his surname from Procter to Waller in 1816.<br>
<br>Procter was educated at, successively, a dame-school in Finchley, a small boarding-school perhaps at Acton, and Harrow School. He entered Harrow in Lent term 1801, spent about three years there, and acquired some skill at football, cricket, fives, and marbles alongside a modicum of classical education. He was then articled for about three years to a solicitor, Nathaniel Atherton of Calne, Wiltshire, before moving to London about 1807 and concluding his law studies. He was admitted to chancery as a solicitor in summer 1811 and practised in various partnerships in Brunswick Square (1812&#150;19) and in Gray's Inn Place (1819&#150;23). By his father's will, proved on 23 February 1816, he obtained about &pound;500 per annum as a share of the rentals of four houses in Jermyn Street, whereupon he briefly became a dandy; he also took boxing lessons from Tom Cribb, though a lightweight. Procter had a &#145;slight neat figure, vigorous for his size&#146; and a &#145;fine genially rugged little face&#146;  (Carlyle, 1.223).<br>
<br>From 1815 Procter contributed poems to many journals using various pen-names but eventually fixing upon Barry Cornwall. He became a close friend of Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, and William Hazlitt, and over the years became acquainted with most of the best writers in London. He had a genius for friendship, being a man of great kindness and generous appreciation, &#145;a man whom everybody loves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henry Crabb Robinson</span>, 2.548), and an excellent host. He was a good talker, but in five volumes published over four years he never found a poetic voice of his own. His pseudo-Jacobean playlets in <span class="italic">Dramatic Scenes and other Poems</span> (1819) are modelled on Lamb's <span class="italic">Specimens of the English Dramatic Poets</span>. In <span class="italic">A Sicilian Story, with Diego de Montilla, and other Poems</span> (1820) the first title-poem imitates Hunt and the second unwisely attempts to imitate Procter's old Harrovian schoolfellow Lord Byron. <span class="italic">Marcian Colonna, an Italian Tale, with Three Dramatic Scenes, and other Poems</span> (1820) mostly echoes Hunt. Procter's only full-length play, the blank-verse tragedy of <span class="italic">Mirandola</span>, is Jacobean pastiche again, but it ran for sixteen nights at Covent Garden in 1821, and, with three printed editions that year, earned &pound;630 for the author. A third volume of mostly Huntian narrative verse, <span class="italic">The Flood of Thessaly, The Girl of Provence, and other Poems</span> (1823) was damned by <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> as Greekish cockney.<br>
<br>Marriage and financial need, probably more than bad reviews, stemmed the flood of poetry. On 7 October 1824 Procter married Ann Benson Skepper (1799&#150;1888), the daughter of Thomas Skepper of York (deceased), and his wife, Anna Dorothea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benson, now married to the distinguished lawyer and legal writer Basil Montagu (1770&#150;1851) and hostess to a brilliant literary salon at 25 Bedford Square. The newly-weds had a cheese-paring honeymoon, lived for some months at 14 Southampton Row, and then moved in with the Montagus at Bedford Square; they remained there for seven years with their growing family (four daughters and two sons) while Procter, with Montagu's help, cultivated a practice in conveyancing and read for the bar. He entered Gray's Inn on 5 May 1826 and was admitted barrister on 4 May 1831. He continued to write occasional poems and prose essays for journals and published <span class="italic">English Songs, and other Small Poems</span> (1832), a collection of melodious but trite lyrics mostly written ten or more years earlier, but otherwise was &#145;altogether abandoned to law&#146;, as he complained to Leigh Hunt in 1826  (Mayer, 561). In 1832 he was appointed a metropolitan commissioner of lunacy with a stipend of &pound;800 per annum (increased to &pound;1500 with a greater workload in 1845), and removed his family from the Montagus' grand house to a little Gothic cottage at 5 Grove End Road, St John's Wood. His young son Edward died of scarlet fever in 1836 and his mother died in 1837, leaving Procter nearly &pound;800 in bank annuities.<br>
<br>Apart from revised and enlarged editions of <span class="italic">English Songs</span> and <span class="italic">Dramatic Scenes</span>, Procter's new books after the creative burst between 1819 and 1823 were all in prose, some of them little better than hack work. They included letterpress for engraved portraits in <span class="italic">Effigies poeticae</span> (1824) and <span class="italic">Tableaux of National Character</span> (1837), a preface to <span class="italic">Melanie and other Poems</span> (1835) by the flamboyant American Nathaniel Parker Willis, and memoirs of Ben Jonson and Shakespeare in editions of their works (1838 and 1843). Procter's longest prose work, <span class="italic">The Life of Edmund Kean</span> (1835), was justifiably damned in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> and the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. His circle of friends expanded to embrace many younger writers, notably Thomas Lovell Beddoes, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Coventry Patmore, and, especially, Robert Browning and John Forster. Among the dedications he received were those of Browning's <span class="italic">Columbe's Birthday</span> (1844) and Thackeray's <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (1848).<br>
<br>Procter continued his conveyancing business at 4 Gray's Inn Square, where Alexander Kinglake, Patmore, and Eliot Warburton were among his pupils, and as lunacy commissioner expended much time and energy inspecting asylums all over England, attending meetings, and making reports. Mary Lamb, the sister of his dear, dead friend, was one of the patients he helped. He wrote to Leigh Hunt in 1840 of &#145;being stupid and exhausted, as I am nine nights out of ten, owing to my sitting up (at work) till three or four o'clock in the morning&#146;  (Mayer, 562), and it was during journeys between asylums that he acquired the habit of sleeping in company.<br>
<br>In 1843 the Procters moved to 13 Upper Harley Street and in 1853 to 32 Weymouth Street. At both houses Procter's sociable and talented wife's &#145;tremendous energy and genius for gossip made her a hostess of distinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Private Papers of &hellip; Thackeray</span>, 1.cliii), so that the Procters' parties became a long-lived institution of literary London. Procter received a legacy of &pound;6500 from his friend John Kenyon (<i>d</i>. 1856), but it seems that he lost heavily on some American state loan that was repudiated at the time of the civil war and had to sell a much admired collection of Italian masters. In February 1861 he relinquished office as lunacy commissioner and was awarded a pension of &pound;625 per annum. His close friend John Forster succeeded him as commissioner and helped him complete two last tributes to literary friendships, <span class="italic">Selections from Robert Browning</span> (1863) and <span class="italic">Charles Lamb: a Memoir</span> (1866).<br>
<br>Procter was now in the &#145;dark desert&#146; of old age  (Chorley, 2.241). His eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22834/', "Adelaide Anne Procter")</script>, died in 1864, having eclipsed his poetical reputation with her <span class="italic">Legends and Lyrics</span>, and his only surviving son, Montagu, was an army officer in India. By 1867 Procter was suffering from the prostate gland; by 1868 his speech was impaired, he was partly paralysed by a stroke, and could venture out only in an invalid's chair, but he could still read without spectacles. He died of &#145;paralysis&#146; (presumably a stroke) on 4 October 1874 (three days short of his golden wedding anniversary) at 32 Weymouth Street and was buried two days later in St Marylebone cemetery, East Finchley.<br>
<br>Procter's widow continued the literary salon until she died in 1888, having survived all her children but one daughter. With Coventry Patmore she edited Procter's <span class="italic">An Autobiographical Fragment and Biographical Notes</span> (1877). It was prefaced by verse tributes from Walter Savage Landor (<i>b</i>. 1775) and Algernon Swinburne (<i>d</i>. 1909), testifying to the range and endurance of Procter's friendships.<br>
