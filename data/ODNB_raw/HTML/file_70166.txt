<span class="headword">Industrial spies</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>1700&#150;<em>c.</em>1800) <span class="occ"></span>were among numerous Europeans with an interest in technology who visited Britain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, knowing that the country was ahead of the rest of Europe in its manufacturing techniques and organization.<h2>
<a name="Industrialgrandtourists"></a>Industrial grand tourists</h2>Depending on the particular field, an &#145;industrial grand tour&#146; could include much of Great Britain and Ireland. Not all these men were entirely innocent visitors. Some were industrial spies, sent by their governments or acting on behalf of their own or family businesses, and knowing that they were not welcome at every door, while some of them concocted elaborate deceptions to cover their real purpose. The focus of interest changed over time, from the early Scandinavian concern with the iron and brass industries, through the Russian and French interest in shipbuilding and gun founding, to the later study of steam engines, textiles, pottery, and glass, but most took the opportunity to view whatever was available to them. Some already spoke good English, others took steps to learn. They also needed to recognize the important elements of what they were seeing, and to record these as notes and/or technical drawings. Many of these documents, having been submitted to authority on return and preserved in official archives, are now being studied and, in a few cases, published for the benefit of scholars.<br>
<br>As British technology improved on that of its neighbours, steps were taken to prevent the recruitment of skilled men and the transfer overseas of information and actual machines. In 1696 an act was passed to ban export of machinery: it was aimed primarily at the export of knitting frames. Other legislation followed, to prohibit the export of various types of machines and tools and prevent skilled men from leaving the country, with France seen as the principal attraction. The act of 1774 applied to &#145;any machine, tool, press, paper, utensil or implement whatsoever&#146;, and the 1785 <span class="roman">Tools Act</span> prohibited all exportation of tools, with an emphasis on manufacturing machines and engines of all sorts. Despite these restrictions, many skilled machine makers and operatives were tempted to emigrate, and, by more or less devious methods, various foreigners managed to take down descriptions and drawings of machinery and processes for replication in their own countries. British manufacturers were often in a difficult situation; while they sought to keep certain processes secret, they were at the same time eager to show off their manufacturing facilities and their products, with a view to selling overseas. A number of young men went to London as apprentices or journeymen with the leading scientific instrument makers. While expected to learn, some undoubtedly contravened the law by taking home drawings, models, and even machinery.<br>
<br>The reverse process also operated, albeit on a smaller scale, since Britain was a leader in so many fields. In the seventeenth century the art of making crystal glass was jealously guarded in Venice, and was furtively investigated by English merchants and travellers. They found, as was often the case, that written descriptions were unsatisfactory, for only experienced workmen could make the apparatus and carry out the operations necessary for many of these technical processes. Despite strict laws prohibiting their movement, many Venetian glassworkers were enticed to various parts of western Europe, including London. In the eighteenth century similar attempts were made to bring from France the manufacture of large crystal plates for mirrors, leading by the 1770s to their production at St Helens in Lancashire. The most successful British spying mission seems to have been that of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16955/', "John Lombe")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16956/', "Lombe, Thomas")</script>], who in 1716 went to Leghorn and managed to see and draw the machinery for twisting silk thread. Small quantities of this thread had hitherto been illicitly imported into Britain, but with the arrival of immigrant Huguenot silk weavers far more was needed. John's brother Thomas secured a patent and the necessary capital and erected a vast silk throwing mill, powered by the River Derwent, near Derby.<h2>
<a name="Scandinavians"></a>Scandinavians</h2>By the end of the seventeenth century Britain still imported the bulk of her needs of bar iron and copper from Sweden, but copper refining was already under way around Bristol, an area of mercantile importance close to ample supplies of fuel and water. Other products of the Bristol area included iron, brass, pottery, glass, and gunpowder. The Swedish mining industry therefore had cause for concern lest the advancement of refining processes in Britain diminish the need for Swedish goods. As early as 1696 the Bergskollegium (&#145;College of Mines&#146;) sent a mining expert, Thomas Cletcher, to inspect the copper works of Elton and Wayne at Bristol. In 1710 G&ouml;ran Wallerius, a metallurgist, visited Redbrook copper works near Bristol, but he was taken for a spy and told to leave.<br>
<br>A more professional approach was that of <a name="cosubject_72310"></a><span class="headword">Jonas Alstr&ouml;mer</span>  (1685&#150;1761), who arrived in Britain in 1707, settled down as a successful <span class="occ">businessman</span>, took British nationality, and became Swedish consul in London. In 1714&#150;15 and in 1719&#150;20 he made extensive tours, paying much attention to industries in the Bristol region but also looking at textile manufacture. On his return to Sweden in 1724 he introduced new breeds of sheep and set up a manufactory for woollen goods.<br>
<br>Alstr&ouml;mer introduced <a name="cosubject_72315"></a><span class="headword">Henrik Kalmeter</span>  (1693&#150;1750), <span class="occ">mining engineer</span>, who had been sent abroad by the Bergskollegium. He arrived in Britain in 1719 and went to stay with his uncle, a music teacher, in Edinburgh. He toured the mining region of Leadhills, examining the process of extracting the lead, which was mainly sent to Holland for use in lead glaze, and also its by-product, silver. He visited several great houses on the way to St Andrews, noting forestry and plantings. At Leith he visited salt works, sugar boilers, and soap manufactories. He took in a coalmine near Kinghorn, and at Dryden saw working one of the earliest Newcomen engines to reach Scotland. Kalmeter also toured England; in Bristol he called on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57867/', "Nehemiah Champion (1649&#150;1722)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47487/', "Champion family (per. c.1670&#150;1794)")</script>], who allowed him to look over his brass-foundry. Kalmeter wrote two important works on the iron industry, parts of which were incorporated with Emanuel Swedenborg's <span class="italic">Opera philosophica and mineralia</span> (1734). Swedenborg (1688&#150;1722) was better known as a philosopher, but he travelled in England in 1710&#150;12 before being appointed to the Bergskollegium in 1716.<br>
<br>A known spy was <a name="cosubject_72320"></a><span class="headword">Reinhold R&uuml;tker Angerstein</span>  (1718&#150;1760), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, a member of Jernkontoret, the Swedish ironmasters' association, founded in 1747. Its purpose was to find a solution to the difficulties then besetting the Swedish iron industry, principally poor demand and low prices. As chemical and technical learning advanced, the Swedes realized that they should concentrate on high quality. When English ironmasters discovered how to use coal in the manufacture of wrought iron the Swedes were eager to inspect the process. Between 1753 and 1755 Angerstein was welcomed by Champion in Bristol; he also looked at the manufacture of steel, tinplate, and glass, and the process of desilvering lead. He traversed England and left voluminous notes on prices, wages, and conditions of commerce and industry, with comments on London's Swedish colony. <br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72322"></a><span class="headword">John Ludwig Robsahm</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1760&#150;1761)<span class="occ"></span> extended spying techniques because he was eager to obtain all sorts of secret information. He arrived in 1760 and stayed for a year. He was in Bristol in 1761 and visited Champion's works after dark, although Champion was one of the few industrialists to keep relatively open house for foreign visitors. Robsahm managed to see <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14247/', "Benjamin Huntsman's")</script> famous steel casting works, but did not fully comprehend the secret process; he also investigated a zinc works near Bristol. Huntsman's secret was finally uncovered by Benkt Qvist Andersson, a mining engineer who was in England in 1766&#150;7. He set up near Stockholm the first cast-steel works outside England.<br>
<br>The astronomer <a name="cosubject_72323"></a><span class="headword">Bengt Ferrner</span>  (1724&#150;1802) came to England as <span class="occ">tutor to a young nobleman</span>. After having left his pupil at Bath he went to Bristol, where he took elaborate steps to avoid detection. He tried to make contacts with workmen in order to learn covertly about Champion's works, and visited a tinplate mill and lead and calamine mines. He also tried to entice skilled men to emigrate to Sweden, a practice which became increasingly common. In 1754&#150;6 the Norwegian <a name="cosubject_72324"></a><span class="headword">Morton Waern</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1754&#150;1756)<span class="occ"></span> was in England to learn about crown glass manufacture, the first project proposed by the Konglige Allernaadigst Octrojerade Norske Compagnie, set up to exploit Norway's natural resources. He travelled to Newcastle upon Tyne, then the centre of the industry, and also to Leith, Hull, Bristol, Liverpool, and Yarmouth, obtaining drawings of furnaces and information on the composition of the glass and sending home reports and samples of raw materials. All his correspondence went through intermediaries so as to prevent detection. His most important task was to persuade skilled men to move to Norway, and he tried to recruit a team consisting of master, gatherer, blower, and finisher from the same glasshouse, so that they could work well together. But suspicion was aroused when he tried to suborn workmen; he was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate. Granted bail, he fled the country, taking his notes and papers with him. He had earlier succeeded in recruiting men in Newcastle and Liverpool, and they set up the first crown glass factory at Hurdal, 80 kilometres north of Christiania.<br>
<br>Equally covert in his approach was <a name="cosubject_72326"></a><span class="headword">J&oslash;ns Mathias Ljungberg</span>  (1748&#150;1812), a Swede by birth who became <span class="occ">professor of mathematics and astronomy</span> at Kiel and a Danish civil servant. He asked for six months' leave to travel abroad in order to study mathematics and astronomy and to purchase instruments. His first visit to Britain in 1777 was uneventful, but when he made another request in 1778 he was seen as the ideal person to bring back a spinning-machine and associated equipment. He failed to acquire the machine, but brought sufficient information to allow one to be constructed in Copenhagen. In 1780 he severed his association with Kiel and moved to Kommercekollegiet. In 1787 Ljungberg was arrested in London just as he was loading three years' harvest of technical espionage onto a ship bound for Denmark. The customs inspectors uncovered patented machinery, scientific instruments, models, drawings, and notebooks. The haul included items from the Wedgwood potteries at Etruria and also containers of cobalt, lead, and manganese ores. His notes indicated visits to Staffordshire, Cornwall, Birmingham, Coalbrookdale, Derby, Manchester, Leeds, Matlock, and Nottingham. Ljungberg had earlier been caught bribing workmen to bring him measurements of kilns and other equipment. Before the government could arrange for his notes to be translated and encourage manufacturers to bring charges, the Danish legation put up the &pound;300 bail set, and he was freed and fled; furthermore, the legation bought his confiscated goods at auction, and eventually most of his plunder was returned to him. He went back to Kommercekollegiet, and the fruits of this expedition gradually appeared in the pottery and porcelain manufactories of Denmark. In 1793 he was back in England, this time studying the canal system.<br>
<br>The Dane <a name="cosubject_72339"></a><span class="headword">Jesper Bidstrup</span>  (1763&#150;1802)<span class="occ"></span> was sent by his government to acquire skills and knowledge in scientific instrument making; he arrived in London in 1787 and spent the next ten years in improving his skills, making wooden models, and acquiring the machinery, including tube drawing and glass cutting machines and a dividing engine, to establish himself back in Copenhagen. By 1797 everything was ready, including the first coal-fuelled cupola furnace to reach Scandinavia. The machines were dismantled and hidden among other goods on separate ships destined for Cuxhaven and Copenhagen. Bidstrup did not live long enough to enjoy the fruits of his labours. He fell ill on his return and died in 1802, leaving the most splendid workshop and machinery, which was taken as state property and handed over to other instrument makers in Copenhagen.<h2>

<a name="cosubject_72327"></a><span class="headword">Nikolay Ivanovich Korsakov</span>  (1749&#150;1788)<span class="occ"></span> was sent by the Petersburg Engineering Corps to study canal building. He arrived in London in April 1775, studied in Oxford for a year, and set out the following May for Scotland, bearing letters of introduction to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25746/', "John Smeaton")</script>, who recommended that he look first at the Forth and Clyde Canal. Throughout his tour Korsakov took copious detailed notes of canals, mills, foundries, manufactories, and machines, concerning not just their construction, but also their adoption and development, not omitting the patent system. He managed to get into a number of otherwise closed places by providing himself with letters of introduction, and thus at Newcastle saw a machine for gun boring. At the Carron ironworks he was not permitted to see the gun boring machinery and could make only general sketches. He spent three months in Glasgow, was made a freeman of the city, and visited Glasgow and Edinburgh universities. On his way south he spent time on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and on the Bridgewater, the latter with its aqueduct over the River Irwell being a famous sight. He called on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28966/', "Josiah Wedgwood")</script>, then hurried on to the Soho works of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2983/', "Matthew Boulton")</script> and John Fothergill. While these two men were eager to publicize their products with a view to entering the Russian market, there was always a reluctance to admit foreigners freely to the works. Fothergill went to Russia in 1776; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28880/', "James Watt")</script>, who had been invited to settle there in 1771, was hoping to sell engines to Russia, but Korsakov, while admiring Watt, did not realize the full potential of Watt engines and advised his masters to keep to Newcomen engines if Watt's charges seemed high.<br>
<br>Korsakov was also invited to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29428/', "John Wilkinson's")</script> foundries at Bilston and Broseley, where he saw a blowing machine for coke smelting of iron ore and lesser machines. He next visited Southampton and Portsmouth before returning to Leeds, where at last he was able to meet Smeaton in person. His last six months were spent in Oxford drawing up his canal plans. Korsakov was impressed by what he saw, noting it with an observant and critical eye and appreciating both craft skills and the university education which he sampled. He spent two years in France and Italy before returning to Russia. He was not employed on canals but went to the newly annexed Crimea, where he built the city that became Sevastopol. He died in an accident during the Turkish War in 1788.<br>
<br>In 1719 <a name="cosubject_72328"></a><span class="headword">Andrey Konstantinovich Narkov</span>  (1680?&#150;1756), an outstanding machine tool <span class="occ">engineer</span>, went to London with orders to seek information on the newly invented improved methods of steaming and bending the oak used in shipbuilding. He failed in this task, but was able to see a screw cutting lathe for the Royal Mint, a lead drawing machine for the Admiralty, dies for coining, gear cutting machinery, a boring machine, and a silver and gold sheet rolling mill. He also discovered the secret of steel smelting, which made possible the casting of hollow steel cylinders for lathe chucks.<br>
<br>Nikolay Galaktionovich Chizhov (1731&#150;1767) was a trained instrument maker who went to London in 1760 to improve his skills under <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/116/', "George Adams the elder")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49854/', "Adams family (per. 1734&#150;1817)")</script>]. He bought as many instruments as possible and carefully examined larger ones, such as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25459/', "James Short's")</script> new 12 foot telescope at Greenwich. Another Russian, Vorobyov, worked in 1781 under Kenneth McCulloch, compass maker. Osip Ivanovich Shishorin worked for five years with John Stancliffe; Vasily Konstantinovich Sveshnikov was five years with Simon Spicer. When writing home for money, they explained that they had to bribe knowledgeable workmen in order to acquire information that their masters would not disclose to foreigners.<h2>
<a name="FrenchmenandBelgians"></a>Frenchmen and Belgians</h2>
<a name="cosubject_72331"></a><span class="headword">Charles Albert</span>  (<em>b. </em>1767, <em>d.</em> in or after 1834)<span class="occ"></span>, originally from Strasbourg, had previously spent a year in Manchester when in 1790 he was approached by two acquaintances who intended to set up a cotton mill in Toulouse. They asked him to go to England to examine textile machinery and recruit workmen for the Toulouse mill. Albert settled again in Manchester and found an accomplice, with whose help he set about his tasks. He was in London in November 1791 to meet the two men he had recruited, but one failed to appear and Albert heard that the man planned to denounce him. Albert sent his recruit to France with the notes and drawings and returned to Manchester, where he was arrested in December. Offered his freedom in exchange for helping to extradite the man who was in France, Albert refused for the patriotic reason that France needed skilled men.<br>
<br>Albert was sent to Lancaster Castle to await trial; meanwhile the French envoy and the acquaintances who had sent him to England pledged support and raised &pound;500 for his bail. However, at Newgate three charges were laid against him with bail set at &pound;500 on each, and as this sum was not forthcoming Albert was returned to Lancaster. In August 1792 he was found guilty, sentenced to a year in prison, and fined &pound;500. When his term expired no money was produced, and he spent another four years in prison as a debtor. Meanwhile the Toulouse mill prospered, especially as the French Revolution had increased the need for military uniforms.<br>
<br>Eventually John Higgin, the prison governor, petitioned for Albert's release. Albert was befriended by the Johnson family of Bolton-le-Sands, and on his release in December 1796 he married their daughter Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1834) and left England with instructions not to return unless the fine was paid. He sought to recover the promised money from his acquaintances, but they had no time for him; at length he took them to court, won his case, and later still was reimbursed for his pains. He settled in Strasbourg as an <span class="occ">engineer and inventor</span>. His years in England were not wasted; in the Paris Exhibition of 1806 he won a gold medal and 6000 francs for his invention of spinning and weaving machinery and a small steam engine. After his wife's death in 1834 Albert sent to her family medals commemorating her birth, marriage, and death and a pr&eacute;cis of his story.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72332"></a><span class="headword">Gabriel Jars</span>  (1732&#150;1769)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of an owner of copper mines in the Lyonnais, where he was trained before coming to the attention of Trudaine, minister of commerce, under whose patronage he visited mines in central Europe. His brief was to learn about minerals, metallurgy, and dyestuffs derived from minerals. In July 1764 he was sent to Britain, ostensibly on a scientific and educational tour but in fact with detailed instructions to discover many aspects of industry and manufacture. Jars went first to Newcastle where he learned English. He then examined coalmines in that district and in lowland Scotland, looking at the regulations, the prices, and the uses of the various types of coal, including that for coke, a substance not known in France. He then looked at the lead&#150;silver mines and their management and the Cornish tin mines with their stannary laws, calling in on any copper mines which happened to lie on his route. He was also commanded to investigate the iron smelting practices, steel making, and the source of iron ore for cementation, and he was to obtain drawings of the machinery for imparting a high polish to steel and copper artefacts. He was to discover how English files were cut and tempered to make them harder than those manufactured in Germany. Besides this exhaustive set of demands, Jars was to look at sulphuric acid production and the manufacture of earthenware, pottery, and paper, and to investigate the breeding of English sheep and to enquire whether it was possible to obtain any of these animals.<br>
<br>Before he left France, Jars asked the expatriate Englishman John Holker to recommend a trustworthy agent, and on arrival he contacted the marquis de Blosset, intelligence adviser at the French embassy. On his northern tour he was able to compile detailed reports on the Newcastle mines, coke works in Cumberland, the use of coal in glasshouses, and the various practices of forging and casting. He visited the famous Carron ironworks in southern Scotland where 800 workers were employed mining coal and iron ore, making coke, smelting, and casting. He also visited the alum mines of Whitby and the salt mines in Northwich.<br>
<br>On the manufacturing side, Jars reported on earthenware manufacture in the north-east, in Staffordshire and at Liverpool, and also on porcelain and the invention of printing on pottery. He examined the process of file manufacture at Newcastle and at Sheffield. He visited the briefly important copper mines in Yorkshire and Staffordshire, and smelting works near Derby, Bristol, and Hayle in Cornwall, although at Derby and at the brass making works at Cheadle he was prevented from seeing as much as he wished. He was able to see over the lead mines and to compare the technology with that in Europe. On his way back to London he visited a sulphuric works in Wandsworth, but could only glance round the laboratory, which the owner had staffed with Welsh women whose limited English prevented them from disclosing the secrets of manufacture. On his return, Jars was rewarded with government and academic favours, and he was later sent on further strenuous tours within Europe. He died from sunstroke in the Auvergne in August 1769.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72333"></a><span class="headword">Le Camus de Limare</span>  (<em>b. </em>1736), a Louviers <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, went to England in 1781 at the height of the war against France (part of the American War of Independence) to examine the production of copper sheathing for warships and to recruit workmen for its manufacture. As a good English speaker, he was able to travel in England. His route is not known, but may have taken in <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38133/', "Thomas Williams")</script>'s works at Holywell in Flintshire and on the Thames at Marlow and Wraysbury. He managed to find workmen to operate a plant which he set up at Romilly, using water power and emulating the English manufacture of regularly rolled copper plates and nails of a better shape than those previously used in French vessels.<br>
<br>The problem with sheathing was that catalytic corrosion took place in sea water when copper sheets were fastened by iron nails, and this could leave the hull literally leaking like a sieve. The solution was first found in Britain with the manufacture of hardened copper bolts. French scientists were eager to learn about this, and when the war ended a party consisting of one of the de Wendel family of ironmakers and other French officers called on several iron and copper masters, including Wilkinson's Ravenhead smelter. While their visits were open, care was taken to prevent the party from seeing more than they already knew, except at Ravenhead, since the Parys mine which supplied it was already negotiating for contracts with the French navy.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72334"></a><span class="headword">Bart&eacute;lemy Faujas de St-Fond</span>  (1741&#150;1819), <span class="occ">author</span> of <span class="italic">A Journey through England and Scotland to the Hebrides</span> (trans. A. Geikie, 2 vols., 1907), visited Britain in the guise of a mineralogist with an interest in allied technical matters. He was attached to the French inspectorate concerned with converting French industries to coal fuel, and this naturally led him to visit Wedgwood's potteries and the Newcastle glassworks, both of which were coal-fuelled and in some respects superior to similar establishments in France which were wood-fuelled. As a foreigner he was presumably suspect, for at Prestonpans, seeking to visit a sulphuric acid works, he could do no more than describe the walls surrounding the plant, so high that not even the tall chimneys were visible, while other walls surrounded the port so that the ships delivering sulphur and taking the acid away could not be seen. At the Carron ironworks he was told that although he would be taken round, there were several processes he would not see. In his supposed role as an innocent visitor he felt unable to take notes and thus had to memorize everything until he could write his reports at night.<br>

<a name="cosubject_72335"></a><span class="headword">Pierre Alexandre Forfait</span>  (1752&#150;1807) and <a name="cosubject_72336"></a><span class="headword">Daniel Lescallier</span>, Baron Lescallier in the French nobility  (<em>fl. </em>1789&#150;1790)<span class="occ"></span>, were sent to England in 1789&#150;90 to get the latest information on naval technology. Forfait was an experienced <span class="occ">naval architect</span> who rose to be in charge of administration at Le Havre. Lescallier had spent five years in England as a young man and was a fluent English speaker. He had travelled in Russia and Sweden on naval business and had held various colonial administrative posts. Their visit was not entirely successful. They arrived in the short days of early winter, the daylight hours were further reduced by bad weather, and Forfait was ill for much of the time. They found the navy yards closed to them, but this was not a handicap as they were freely admitted to the yards building vessels for the Greenland and East India trades. The men in these yards, which also built for the navy in times of war, had technical knowledge and skills equal to those in the royal dockyards. The Frenchmen also found easy access to navy and contractors' gun parks. They paid considerable attention to the process of coppering and took back samples of the new cast-iron pulleys running on copper bearings. Forfait's report remained in manuscript; plans for a possibly more secret and important mission were abandoned when Forfait was appointed to the legislative assembly.<br>

<a name="cosubject_72337"></a><span class="headword">Lieven Bauwens</span>  (1769&#150;1822)<span class="occ"></span>, of a noble Belgian family who engaged in industry and commerce, was sent to England at the age of seventeen to spend three years at the tannery of Underhall and Fox. Three years later he built a large tannery in Ghent, and, after the annexation of Belgium by France, another in Paris. Bauwens had relations in England and also in Hamburg, where his brother had a banking house. He was therefore able to mask his espionage behind genuine mercantile activities, and before he was twenty-nine he had made over thirty journeys to England. In 1797 he and Fran&ccedil;ois de Pauw, who was a relation and business associate, went to London and there recruited Saul Harding, whom they sent to Manchester to buy textile machines. Bauwens also bought machines and a small Boulton and Watt steam engine, and recruited a machine maker, a turner, and a factory manager. The first consignment consisted of machines which had been dismantled and concealed in bales of colonial goods and put on a Danish ship, but they were noticed by customs officials, who impounded the ship and cargo and fined the master. Bauwens hastily left the country, but returned when a second shipment was successfully effected. He recruited more workmen, took delivery of more machines, and with de Pauw and Harding prepared to sail from Gravesend in November 1798. They were exposed, however, when Harding's wife noisily objected to being left behind with her children, magistrates were alerted, and cover stories had to be concocted. Some of the men were taken to Yarmouth and reached Hamburg. Others deserted and informed. Harding and his men were seized and were each sentenced to a fine of &pound;500 and a year in prison. Besides the considerable loss from the seizure of his goods, a deposit of 250,000 francs lodged with an agent was also stolen. Bauwens was condemned by Lord Erskine in the House of Lords for his transfers of knowledge first of tanning and later of the cotton machinery&#151;he had smuggled out large mules and ancillary textile equipment, calico printing machinery, and fly-shuttle looms&#151;and for the suborning of workmen. He subsequently built large steam-powered textile works at Passy in 1798 and at Ghent in 1799, eventually employing some three thousand people. His high-quality products earned him major prizes at the French industrial exhibitions at the turn of the century, and some of his British workmen also earned prizes for their skills. He married Mary Kenyon, daughter of the head of the Manchester workshop which had sold him the first mules. Two sons were established as industrialists in Paris and London. The Frenchman Fran&ccedil;ois Antoine Jecker spent some time in the workshop of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23105/', "Jesse Ramsden (1735&#150;1800)")</script>, the noted scientific instrument maker, before returning to his father's instrument workshop in Paris and there building a replica of Ramsden's straight-line dividing engine.<h2>
<a name="Spaniards"></a>Spaniards</h2>A young Spanish naval officer, <a name="cosubject_72338"></a><span class="headword">Jorge Juan y Santacilla</span>  (1713&#150;1773)<span class="occ"></span>, was sent in 1748 with two colleagues on a secret mission to London with wide-ranging instructions to examine every aspect of shipbuilding and outfitting, to send home plans of each type of ship, and to note any new techniques and apparatus likely to be of value to the Spanish navy, and to acquire new books and scientific instruments relating to navigation. They were also to seek to persuade some of the master shipbuilders, skilled riggers, and sailmakers to emigrate to Spain.<br>
<br>The ostensible purpose of the visit was to contact members of the Royal Society (Juan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in November 1749) with a view to improving their mathematics, and they were to enter the dockyards in the guise of simple sightseers. Juan was given a cipher for communicating with Richard Wall, the Spanish minister in London. Juan had no difficulty in purchasing scientific and medical instruments. As well as on aspects of naval science, he reported on printing and other techniques. An Irishman, Patrick Lahey, explained that Irish sailcloth was judged the best, and he agreed to go to Spain with his wife, some workmen, and a loom on which this superior cloth was produced. Juan managed to send in addition three shipbuilders and a rigging master, with their workmen and families, to Spain. He too, however, was betrayed by the wife of a shipbuilder; word passed to the man's employer and to the duke of Bedford, and Juan was obliged to flee in disguise on a Spanish ship. Despite being stopped and searched several times while going downriver, they were not arrested and reached France safely, where Juan bought some more books before returning to Cadiz. Under the auspices of the Sociedade Real Maritima, Gaspar Jos&eacute; Marquez and Jo&atilde;o Maria Pedroso were apprenticed to the scientific instrument maker Jesse Ramsden for a considerably larger fee than was usual.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>It is likely that other nationals, including diplomats and chaplains, were able to take home industrial and technical information of a secret nature. The Swiss for example had an interest in textiles, and the cook at the Austrian embassy was apparently a conduit for recruiting workmen to that country. The extent and value of such activities remains undiscovered, though current research on industrial espionage is bringing home its extent, the ingenuity of the individuals concerned, and the amount of official involvement in the practice.<br>
