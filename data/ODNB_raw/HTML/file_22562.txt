</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Porter,  Endymion</span>  (1587&#150;1649), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born in 1587 in the manor house of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, the eldest of the eight children of Edmund Porter (<i>d</i>. 1623) and his wife, Angela, the daughter of Giles Porter.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinSpain"></a>Early career in Spain</h2>The Porters were a minor gentry family settled in Warwickshire since the late fifteenth century, which was, however, remarkable in developing connections with Spain in the Elizabethan period. Endymion's grandfather Giles had gone to Castile in the 1560s where he had married Dona Juana de Figueroa y Mont Salve. Although a Catholic Giles had returned with his wife and two daughters to England around 1585 to settle in Mickleton, while his son Luis Porter de Figueroy stayed behind and later entered the Spanish diplomatic service. Endymion grew up in Mickleton. However, when Giles Porter accompanied the earl of Nottingham on his embassy to Spain in 1605 as an interpreter, he and his brother Thomas followed him to Valladolid, then the Spanish capital. In Spain Endymion became a member of the conde de Olivares's household, where he served the conde's heir, Don Gaspar de Guzm&aacute;n, who was the same age as himself. Porter presumably conformed to the Catholic faith of his master while he lived in the Olivares household, although he later returned to the Church of England. Don Gaspar was to become Philip IV's (<i>r</i>. 1621&#150;65) most powerful minister and favourite, and continued to see Porter as a trustworthy confidant at the English court in later years. In 1607 Porter left the household of Olivares and took service with William Calley, an English merchant in Madrid. About 1612 he returned to England having established important contacts at the Spanish court.<h2>
<a name="IntheserviceofBuckingham"></a>In the service of Buckingham</h2>In England Porter entered the service of Edward Villiers, half-brother of George Villiers, who was to become King James I's favourite and duke of Buckingham. Buckingham took Porter into his own service as his master of horse and secretary for his Spanish correspondence late in 1617 or at the beginning of 1618. He soon became one of the more influential members of the favourite's entourage and, allegedly, a &#145;gateway to all favours, with whom nothing but money prevails, and who has become most rich&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1621&#150;3</i>, 439). He reinforced his ties with the Villiers family by marrying Olivia (or Olive) Boteler (<i>d</i>. 1663), daughter of Sir John Boteler and Elizabeth Villiers, one of Buckingham's sisters, in 1619. In 1621 he became a member of the prince of Wales's household, where his knowledge of the Spanish language was seen as a valuable asset. In the following year, in October 1622, he was sent to Spain on a diplomatic mission, to find out whether Philip IV was prepared to make concessions regarding the Palatinate which was occupied by Spanish and Bavarian troops and to take soundings about Madrid's attitude towards a matrimonial alliance between Spain and England. He was injured during an accident while crossing the channel and his journey was largely a diplomatic failure as Olivares, his old master, was not prepared to commit himself to any concessions. In fact Olivares&#151;according to Porter's later testimony&#151;exclaimed in anger &#145;I am ashamed thou should ask such a thing&#146; when Porter somewhat na&iuml;vely demanded a Spanish promise for help against the emperor should the latter refuse to reinstate the elector palatine  (<span class="italic">Proceedings, 1626</span>, 1.598). Moreover relations between Porter and the English ambassador at the Spanish court, the earl of Bristol, were fraught with tension. In January 1623 Porter returned to England. In spite of the setback his mission had suffered he was asked to accompany the prince of Wales and the duke of Buckingham on their journey to Spain shortly afterwards. Although the prince's journey to Spain was a complete failure, Porter's standing with the future king was improved, having acted as an important intermediary between the prince and the Spanish court in Madrid, and having demonstrated his knowledge of works of art, so important to Charles I. After his return he resumed his duties in the prince's household in which he held the position of a groom of the bedchamber. When Charles I succeeded his father Porter retained his status as a groom and became a member of the new royal bedchamber. Shortly afterwards, in 1626, he got involved in the parliamentary proceedings which were to determine whether James I's ambassador to Spain, the earl of Bristol, had betrayed the king's trust by working towards the conversion of the prince of Wales to the Catholic faith. Bristol answered this charge in the House of Lords with a counter-accusation directed against the duke of Buckingham but also against Porter (which in the latter's case was related to his visit to Spain in 1622). Porter was examined by a committee of the House of Lords and tried to depict Bristol as the real culprit, but before the trial could proceed parliament was dissolved.<h2>
<a name="Courtierandfriendofpainters"></a>Courtier and friend of painters</h2>Buckingham's death in 1628 meant that Porter lost his most important patron at court. He remained faithful to the duke's memory and to his family and mentioned Buckingham in his will in 1639 as the one person &#145;to whom I owe all the happiness I had in the world&#146;  (Fonblanque, 82). However, like other members of the Villiers connection he continued to prosper after the duke's death. The king rewarded him generously with grants and lucrative offices complementing the pension of &pound;500 per annum which he received as groom of the bedchamber. He was appointed receiver of fines in Star Chamber in 1628, bought a reversion to the office of surveyor of petty customs in the port of London in 1638, had a share in the Irish customs farm, and held mining rights in Ireland, where he and William Murray were also given in 1634 a patent to discover first fruits and other income from livings and church lands illegally withheld from the crown or the church. He participated in the profits of the Westminster Soap Company, founded in 1632 and dominated to a considerable extent by Catholics or crypto-Catholics like himself, and he also became a member of the Corporation of Salt Makers of Great Yarmouth in 1636. Furthermore he was Sir William Courteen's principal partner in setting up a trading company which was licensed by Charles I in December 1635 to compete with the East India Company in trade with Asia. Even before this so-called Interlopers Company was founded, Porter had invested money in privateering raids in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. These raids and the activities of Courteen's association were much resented by the East India Company as they infringed its monopoly and threatened to endanger its co-operation with the native authorities in India and Arabia. In December 1640 the directors of the East India Company were about to present a petition to parliament to complain against Porter's and Courteen's infringement of their privileges. However, the king persuaded them that Porter had only acted as his own agent in all these matters, and the petition was dropped. Porter was in many ways the quintessential projector and monopolist, and he continued to play this role right up to the end of Charles's personal rule. In the late 1630s he pursued a controversial project which was to entitle him and the other principal patentee, the marquess of Hamilton, master of the horse to the king, to compound with persons who had rendered fraudulent accounts to the crown. As late as 1640 he and three associates were granted a monopoly to produce a special and allegedly new kind of white writing paper. Moreover he also held a patent as deputy postmaster-general from 1635 to 1642, and was involved in various schemes to drain fenland and marshes in England and Ireland. Thus he received a grant of 1000 acres of marshland in north and south Somercotes in Lincolnshire, where, however, his endeavours to improve the quality of the land and raise the rents met with strong resistance by the local population.<br>
<br>Porter never enjoyed any serious political influence at court, although he was undoubtedly the most prominent of Charles I's grooms of the bedchamber and had more access to confidential information than most courtiers. He was occasionally employed in diplomatic negotiations, as in 1628 (to further the cause of peace with Spain) or when he was sent to Brussels in 1634 to congratulate the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand on his appointment as governor-general of the Spanish Netherlands. However, he played an important role in matters of patronage both before and after the duke of Buckingham's death. He regularly received a great number of letters from suitors who wanted him to present their petitions to the king, or influence Charles in their favour. He also helped to advance anti-Calvinist clergy in the church such as John Cosin, and his and his family's religious attitude, increasingly marked by Catholic leanings, helped to &#145;define what was acceptable, even pleasing to the King&#146;  (Hibbard, 56). He was at the centre of the court's artistic and cultural life, he collected pictures, wrote verse, was a patron of many artists and poets, and acted as an important agent and adviser to the king in matters of cultural patronage. Like other painters, Van Dyck was among his friends. He was instrumental in bringing the artist to England in 1632 and having him appointed painter in ordinary to the king. There were even rumours that he shared the favours of Van Dyck's mistress, Margaret Lemon, with the artist. Van Dyck painted a remarkable double portrait of himself and the courtier in the mid-1630s (now in the Prado), and also portrayed Porter's wife and his family. Another well-known portrait of Porter (in the Tate collection), by William Dobson, probably dating from the early 1640s, shows him as an elegant huntsman with a certain air of joviality and <i>bonhomie</i> posing at the same time as a patron of the arts. The poet Robert Herrick dedicated a number of poems to him, and Porter also supported and protected William d'Avenant, who was closely associated with his family.<h2>
<a name="Catholicsympathizer"></a>Catholic sympathizer</h2>What made Porter a controversial figure at court even before the meeting of the Long Parliament were his wife's and his own sympathies with Catholicism. His wife, Olive, was one of the first ladies of the court whom Father Con, the papal agent in England, managed to convert after his arrival at court in summer 1636. Olive went on to persuade her own friends and family to convert. Her father, Lord Boteler, was the first to become a Catholic (on his deathbed) in spring 1637. She then turned her attention to Mary Fielding, marchioness of Hamilton, who was also about to die. It took the joint efforts of Mary's father, the earl of Denbigh, and the bishop of Carlisle to prevent the dying woman's conversion. However, Lady Newport, Olive's sister married to a staunchly protestant husband, did succumb to her influence and that of the duchess of Buckingham soon after this event. Her conversion created quite a scandal but the Porter household continued to be a hotbed of Catholicism. Olive kept a Jesuit chaplain, and had her sons educated as Catholics. Her husband, however, who took soundings at one stage about the possibilities of converting in secret while continuing to accompany the king to protestant worship, remained a protestant mainly for political reasons and out of loyalty to the king.<br>
<br>The letters which Porter exchanged with his wife during his absences from home or the court show his marriage to have been an affectionate one, though not without its moments of tension. Olive bore Endymion twelve children, seven of whom survived beyond infancy. Next to the two daughters, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1629?, <i>d</i>. March 1643) and Lettice (<i>b</i>. 1631?), there were five sons, of whom the eldest was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22564/', "George Porter (bap. 1621, d. 1683)")</script>. Charles, the second son (<i>b</i>. 1623), fell in the battle of Newburn in 1640 as a cornet in Lord Newport's troop of horse. The third son, Philip (<i>b</i>. 1628), was much given to violent brawls and was imprisoned in the 1650s; he died in 1655. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22579/', "Thomas Porter")</script>, born in 1636, achieved some success as a playwright after the Restoration. James (<i>b</i>. 1638) became groom of the bedchamber in the duke of York's household and subsequently, after the duke had succeeded his brother as king, James II's vice-chamberlain. He followed James into exile and acted as his chamberlain in St Germain.<br>
<br>In the 1630s, at the height of his career, Porter spent his life mostly at court and in his house in the Strand. His family seat in Aston-sub-Edge in Gloucestershire was much less frequently visited and in later years he preferred to stay at Woodhall, near Hatfield, which came into his wife's possession in 1637, when he was not at court or in London. Because so much of his income was derived from royal grants or monopolies of one sort or another, his financial situation deteriorated rapidly when his numerous patents became difficult or impossible to enforce or were revoked altogether at the end of the 1630s and in the early 1640s. Embodying in his person many of the traits the critics of the personal rule disliked most in courtiers (the Catholic, pro-Spanish projector with a distinctly non-puritan attitude to life) he was bound to become the object of attacks when Charles I's authority crumbled. In August 1640 Archbishop Laud was told by the English ambassador in the Netherlands, Boswell, who relied on material provided by a Bohemian protestant in exile, Andreas ab Habernfeld, that there was a Jesuit plot to kill Charles I, in the hope of establishing a Catholic monarchy under his son. Porter was one of the courtiers allegedly implicated in this plot. He and his wife, it was maintained, were not only fanatical Catholics but enemies of the king and willing agents of the pope's envoy in England. At the time Habernfeld's fantastical accusations did not affect Porter's position at court, but when William Prynne got hold of the material in 1643 he was publicly branded a Catholic conspirator. Even earlier he was wrongly accused of having sealed the commission Sir Phelim O'Neill produced to justify the Irish rising of 1641 with the great seal of Scotland, which had indeed at times been in his custody during the king's stay in Scotland in 1641.<br>
<br>Porter was elected to the Long Parliament in November 1640 for Droitwich in Worcestershire. He may have owed his seat to the local influence of Thomas, Lord Windsor, who probably shared his pro-Catholic sympathies. Porter was among the &#145;Straffordians&#146; in the House of Commons and withdrew with the king from London after the failed attempt on the five members. Named by the Commons in February 1642 as one of the courtiers who should be removed from the royal household, he was not disabled from sitting in parliament until 3 March 1643. During the civil war he belonged to the king's personal entourage but did not command a regiment himself although nominally a colonel. He was also a member of the Oxford parliament. He was one of the few members of the king's court who were fully familiar with the plans to recruit a Catholic army in Ireland for the royalist cause and he personally affixed the great seal to the earl of Glamorgan's commission to treat with the Irish in April 1644. He went into exile to France in July 1645 where he was joined by Olive in April of the following year. Out of favour with Henrietta Maria and financially totally destitute he moved on to Brussels early in 1647, where he was more welcome than at the French court. He returned to England at the beginning of 1649. The committee for compounding fixed his fine at the comparatively small sum of &pound;222 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>., probably because he was already financially ruined. He died in London in August 1649 and was buried in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 20 August. His wife, Olive, received the office of surveyor of the petty customs to which Endymion had bought a reversion after the Restoration but died in 1663, and was buried next to her husband on 13 December 1663.<br>
