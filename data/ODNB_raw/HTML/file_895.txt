<span class="headword">Audley, Sir  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1318&#150;1369), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was an outstanding exemplar of chivalry, and one of the heroes of the chronicler Froissart. He was the illegitimate son of Sir James Audley (<i>d</i>. 1334) of Stratton Audley, Oxfordshire , and Eva, daughter of Sir John Clavering. Study of his life is complicated by homonymity; in particular he has frequently been confused with his relative James Audley (<i>d</i>. 1386), lord of Heighley, but there were also several other contemporaries of the same name. Fortunately, though there are differences of detail, Froissart's account of Audley's exploits at the battle of Poitiers (19 September 1356), on which his enduring reputation rests, receives support in other independent contemporary narratives, especially Geoffrey le Baker's, and from the rewards heaped on him by the prince of Wales, so that his leading part in the battle cannot be doubted. He may also have shown the great magnanimity on which Froissart remarks, in immediately making over the prince's initial gift of a generous pension to his four attendant esquires, though their names elude scholars: the tradition that they were Delves of Doddington, Foulehurst of Barthomley, Hawkestone of Wrinehill, and Dutton of Dutton&#151;all men of Cheshire&#151;cannot be traced before the late seventeenth century.<br>
<br>The earliest certain reference to Audley is in a protection granted in June 1346 when he was about to go abroad in the retinue of Edward, prince of Wales, and it was in the latter's service that he passed most of his life. He was at Cr&eacute;cy, and Froissart claims him as one of four knights of the prince's body who witnessed Edward III confer knighthood on his son before the battle. Afterwards he remained in the field until Calais was taken (1347) and was named on the prince's side among the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92770', "founding knights of the Garter")</script>. He may (or may not) have been the Sir James whose arrest was sought in July 1348 for failure to come to the royal council to discuss matters concerning the welfare of the realm. Some versions of Froissart, but not all, relate that he was present at the battle of Winchelsea (1350) and at the relief of St Jean d'Ang&eacute;ly in the next year. More certainly, he was with the prince in London in June 1351 and was rewarded with armour for attending a tournament at Eltham on 31 December 1353 along with Sir John Chandos, with whom he is almost always inseparably linked by chroniclers.<br>
<br>From 1355 Audley's career comes more closely into focus: he was already in receipt of an above average annual pension of &pound;80 when he accompanied the prince to Bordeaux. His presence on the raid that reached Narbonne in the autumn is attested by a letter from Edward on Christmas day 1355 which mentions him operating with Chandos against the count of Armagnac in the Toulouse region, while early in 1356 the same knights used Moissac (Lot-et-Garonne) as a base for attacks on the Agenais, taking and holding nearby Castelsagrat. When the prince launched the campaign that culminated at Poitiers, Audley and Chandos again accomplished several bold deeds and were members of the prince's <i>&eacute;tat majeur</i>. Near Vierzon on 28 August they routed a company under Philippe de Chambly. Audley also took part in discussions on the eve of the battle, aimed at avoiding conflict, though when it came he was in the forefront, having, according to Froissart, made a vow to strike the first blow. Both he and Baker confirm that Audley was found exhausted after the battle, bleeding profusely and more dead than alive, only reviving after he had been borne to the prince, who allegedly rose from supper with the French king, Jean II, to minister to him and praise his gallantry.<br>
<br>Confirmation of the prince's gratitude for Audley's services that day is provided by a grant of &pound;400 p.a. for life in December 1356 on the stannaries, confirmed by Edward III in 1359. He was later granted 600 &eacute;cus on the customs of Marmande and became lord of Ol&eacute;ron (Charente-Maritime). After recuperating, he may have served at the siege of Rennes in 1357 but his next major opportunity for distinction was the Rheims campaign of 1359&#150;60 where, with Chandos again, he is credited with leading several minor sorties in the Soissonais and capturing the castle of Fert&eacute;-sous-Jouarre (Seine-et-Marne), which he used as a base for further exploits. He was present at Calais on 24 October 1360 to witness the Anglo-French treaty and the release of Jean II and was still abroad in 1361. After a brief visit to England (where his main office from 1360 was constable of Gloucester Castle), he returned to Guyenne with Prince Edward in 1362. The last definite occasion when he was back in England was in April 1363; thereafter he spent his time in France probably because his wife, Margaret Bereford, had already died. They had no children and he possessed no extensive English estates.<br>
<br>Audley was at Poitiers on 26 February 1364 when the Black Prince attempted to mediate between John de Montfort and Charles de Blois, in their dispute over the ducal throne of Brittany. When Edward went to the support of Pedro I of Castile in the autumn of 1366, Audley remained in Guyenne as governor. On the renewed outbreak of war in 1369, he was the prince's lieutenant in Poitou and the Limousin and wasted parts of Berry and the Touraine before besieging La Roche-sur-Yon (Vend&eacute;e) with Edmund, earl of Cambridge. After the town was taken, he retired, perhaps already sick, to Fontenay-le-Comte (Vend&eacute;e) where he died around 23 August, a few months before his lifelong brother-in-arms, Chandos, was killed at Lussac (1 December). A widely praised paragon of chivalry, Audley was mourned on his death by friend and foe alike and his obsequies were held with great pomp at Poitiers. His tomb in the cathedral there was destroyed in 1562.<br>
