<span class="headword">Thornton,  Richard</span>  (1776&#150;1865), <span class="occ">merchant, underwriter, and financier</span>, was born on 20 September 1776 in Burton in Lonsdale, Yorkshire, the third son in the family of four sons and five daughters of Robert Thornton, an impecunious yeoman farmer, and his wife, Ellen. He entered Christ's Hospital school, London, in 1785, leaving in 1791 to become an apprentice to his uncle, Richard Thornton, a hop merchant in Southwark. By 1798 he had moved into the business of insurance as a member of Lloyd's. He also established himself in the Russian trade, which during the French wars offered exceptional opportunities for profit.<br>
<br>The government's need for naval stores, above all hemp, during the Napoleonic blockade, tempted Thornton into daring ventures through the Baltic in his own armed ships, especially in 1810, when this illicit trade was described as the most lucrative in the world. Two years later, apprised by his elder brother and partner, Laurence, of the defeat of Napoleon at Moscow before this was publicly known, he secured large contracts for the forward delivery of Russian imports from the Baltic at their peak wartime prices. He was said to have made over &pound;100,000 from this masterly stroke. Not surprisingly, he earned the lasting sobriquet, &#145;the Duke of Danzig&#146;  (Hoskins, 575). In 1815 the Thornton brothers moved their base from Southwark to the City side of the river, and carried on their business from Old Swan Wharf, near London Bridge, for the next fifty years.<br>
<br>The return of peace saw a redirection of Thornton's interests towards the recently opened markets in the East Indies. In partnership with the West family, Thornton exploited the rich pickings of the Dutch East Indies. Thornton, West &amp; Co. were one of the leading British merchant houses in the eastern seas. The firm was based in Rotterdam, though it was reorganized in London in 1837. The East Indies remained a primary destination for Thornton's British-registered ships&#151;for example, in 1857 six ships traded between London, Java, and Singapore. His fleet also carried French troops to the Crimea.<br>
<br>Thornton became a leading financier of struggling constitutional regimes in Iberia. In 1834, for example, he headed a subscription for the Spanish politician and financier Mendizabal. But these foreign debts were only intermittently repaid and, as a result, in the 1830s and 1840s Thornton headed the committee of Spanish bondholders urging British governments to intervene on their behalf. Thornton was also an important lender to the British government, and at one point reputedly the largest holder of consols.<br>
<br>By the 1840s Thornton was in the forefront of the City of London, not only as merchant and financier but as shipowner and leading marine insurance broker. He now receded from the City, rarely appearing at the exchanges, even the Baltic, the scene of his most memorable deals in Russian tallow. He left a reputation for cockney oratory, for daring gambling of all types, but also for geniality and charitableness. He built and endowed almshouses in Barnet for the Leathersellers' Company when he was its master in 1836&#150;7. In his will he left sizeable sums for schools he had built in his home parishes, as well as for Christ's Hospital, of which he had been a donation governor in 1833. In all, his public bequests amounted to the order of &pound;100,000, an impressive sum, yet only a small proportion of his total wealth, the probate value of which&#151; nearly&pound;2,800,000&#151;represented the largest fortune left in Britain before 1870.<br>
<br>Thornton was a strong, if irregular, family man. The bulk of his fortune was left to Thomas Thornton and Richard Thornton West, his nephews and partners. He never married, but he lived with his housekeeper Lee, and his four illegitimate children were major beneficiaries: his son Richard Napoleon Lee inheriting &pound;400,000, and his three daughters sufficient to maintain them in gentility. Thornton died at his suburban mansion, Cannon Hill, in Merton, Surrey, on 20 June 1865, and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
