<span class="headword">Lehmann,  Rosamond Nina</span>  (1901&#150;1990), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 3 February 1901 in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, the second child and second daughter in the family of three daughters and one son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37664/', "Rudolph Chambers Lehmann (1856&#150;1929)")</script>, journalist, Liberal MP, and oarsman, and his wife, Alice Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis (<i>d</i>. 1956). The Lehmanns were an affluent and gifted family. Rosamond Lehmann's great-grandfather was Robert Chambers (1802&#150;1871), who co-founded the publishing company Chambers; and her great-uncle was the artist Rudolf Lehmann. Of the four Lehmann children, three grew up to distinguish themselves in the arts&#151;Lehmann herself; her younger sister Beatrix, who became an actress; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39838/', "John Lehmann")</script>, the poet, editor, and publisher. &#145;I was bound to write,&#146; Lehmann recalled in old age. &#145;I never considered anything else as a possibility.&#146;<br>
<br>Lehmann was educated at the family home, Fieldhead, until she won a scholarship to read English at Girton College, Cambridge, in 1919. At Cambridge she contributed occasional pieces to <span class="italic">Granta</span>, the magazine founded by her father, and met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40121/', "(Walter) Leslie Runciman")</script>, from 1949 second Viscount Runciman of Doxford (1900&#150;1989), son of the nonconformist shipping magnate and Liberal elder statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35868/', "Walter Runciman, first Viscount Runciman of Doxford")</script>. After graduating with second classes in English (1921) and modern and medieval languages (1922), she and Runciman married in December 1923 and moved to Newcastle. The marriage was brief and unsatisfactory, and it had already broken down when Lehmann's controversial first novel, <span class="italic">Dusty Answer</span>, was published in 1927. This was both a critical and a popular success, its sales enhanced by the author's reputation as a society beauty. Her second novel was, in contrast, poorly received by the critics, who were disconcerted by the glum northern setting and two unhappy marriages described in <span class="italic">A Note in Music</span> (1930). Lehmann's own marriage had been dissolved in 1928 and in the same year she had married the colourful <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52291/', "Wogan Philipps (1902&#150;1993)")</script>, who in 1962 became the second Baron Milford, artist and communist son of Laurence Richard Philipps, first Baron Milford, businessman. A son, Hugo, was born in 1929, and a daughter, Sarah (Sally), in 1934.<br>
<br>Between 1932 and 1953 Lehmann wrote the four novels by which she will be remembered: <span class="italic">Invitation to the Waltz</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Weather in the Streets</span> (1936), <span class="italic">The Ballad and the Source</span> (1944), and <span class="italic">The Echoing Grove</span> (1953). The books are autobiographical in tone, with certain themes and preoccupations occurring throughout, notably the heroine's experience of compelling but destructive sexuality, and the conflict between intelligence and passion. Modern criticism now stresses Lehmann's role in asserting the centrality of female experience, whereas she was once stigmatized as a writer of &#145;women's novels&#146;. She has been commended not only for her treatment of particular issues such as homosexuality and abortion, but also for her technical skill, which became fully apparent in her handling of the non-linear chronological and narrative complexities of <span class="italic">The Echoing Grove</span>.<br>
<br>Between 1930 and 1939 Lehmann lived at Ipsden House, Oxfordshire, where she entertained a wide circle of acquaintances, including Leonard and Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington, W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, and Stephen Spender. By 1939 her second marriage had also failed and in 1941 she began a relationship with the married poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31014/', "Cecil Day-Lewis (1904&#150;1972)")</script>, with whom she lived for several years. Her own marriage was dissolved in 1944, but when Day-Lewis was eventually divorced in 1951 he married Jill Balcon. The effect of his desertion was traumatic, although the tragic turning-point of Lehmann's life occurred in 1958 when her daughter, who had recently married the writer P. J. Kavanagh, contracted poliomyelitis in Jakarta and died, aged twenty-four. Lehmann wrote nothing of literary significance for many years afterwards and devoted herself instead to spiritualism. Her impressionistic autobiography, <span class="italic">The Swan in the Evening</span> (1967), reiterates her belief in Sally's continuing life, and in her last, confusing, novel, <span class="italic">A Sea-Grape Tree</span> (1976), the spirit of Sibyl Jardine, monstrous protagonist of <span class="italic">The Ballad and the Source</span>, converses telepathically with the heroine. Other publications include translations of Jacques Lemarchand and Jean Cocteau; a play, <span class="italic">No More Music</span> (1939); <span class="italic">The Gipsy's Baby, and other Stories</span> (1946), and several spiritualist works.<br>
<br>The reprinting of Lehmann's books by Virago Press in the 1980s brought her a new and appreciative audience. In 1982 she was created CBE and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 1986 she was made an honorary fellow of Girton College. She was also president of the English Centre of International PEN; a member of the council of the Society of Authors, and vice-president of the College of Psychic Studies.<br>
<br>Rosamond Lehmann was tall and beautiful, with almond-shaped eyes, a firm mouth, and a warm, impulsive manner. She died on 12 March 1990 at her London home, 30 Clareville Grove.<br>
