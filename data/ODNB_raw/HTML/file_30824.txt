<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackwell, Sir  Basil Henry</span>  (1889&#150;1984), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born on 29 May 1889, at Blackwell's bookshop, 51 Broad Street, Oxford, the only son and younger child of Benjamin Henry Blackwell (1849&#150;1924), bookseller, and his wife, Lydia (Lilla) (1848&#150;1928), daughter of John Taylor, a Norfolk farmer. Basil's grandfather, Benjamin Harris Blackwell (1813&#150;1855), had first become a bookseller in Oxford in 1845, but he died prematurely when his elder son, Benjamin Henry, was only six. However, on new year's day 1879 Benjamin Henry opened his shop at Broad Street, and by the time Basil was born the business was well established. The family moved out of the shop to 1 Linton Road, Oxford. Blackwell was educated at a dame-school for boys kept by Wilhelmina and Sarah Mardon and then at Magdalen College School, Oxford. In 1907 he achieved a postmastership at Merton College, Oxford, where he received a third class in classical honour moderations (1909) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1911). Here he met Adrian Mott, who became his publishing partner.<br>
<br>On graduation Blackwell went to work for two years in the London office of Oxford University Press in order to learn about publishing; he was joint editor of a volume of essays for the <span class="roman">World's Classics</span>. On new year's day 1913 he joined his father and in September established the publications department separately from the bookshop. In his first year he launched the annual series <span class="roman">Oxford Poetry</span>, which included, over thirty years, Robert Graves, W. H. Auden, and Stephen Spender. He also published Edith Sitwell's first three volumes of poetry. His first editorial assistant was the crime writer Dorothy L. Sayers. On 9 September 1914 he married Marion Christine (1888&#150;1977), daughter of John Soans, schoolmaster, of Ramsgate. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In the next few years (he was rejected for military service because of defective eyesight) Blackwell laid the foundation for the publishing firm of Basil Blackwell and Mott (founded in 1922), which encouraged many young Oxford poets. Blackwell and Adrian Mott were also co-directors of the Shakespeare Head Press, which they saved from bankruptcy, and which allowed them to indulge in fine book production.<br>
<br>However, in 1924 Blackwell's father died and he became chairman of B. H. Blackwell Ltd. This meant that he had to concentrate on the main business of selling new books. This he did reluctantly, as he preferred publishing to bookselling and selling antiquarian books to new books. In spite of this, and through the promotion of export in the USA, by 1929 he was one of the most flourishing and influential booksellers in the country. Almost immediately on assuming complete responsibility for the business he successfully opposed a ring of collusive bidders in antiquarian book auctions. In 1925&#150;6 he was elected president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association. In 1955, after a further outbreak of collusive bidding, Blackwell had the matter raised vigorously in parliament, and, as a result of the publicity, the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association made a new and even more stringent rule against the practice.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Blackwell served his profession well and exercised considerable influence in the book trade of the United Kingdom. From 1934 to 1936 he was president of the Booksellers' Association. He forged an alliance with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36614/', "Stanley Unwin (1884&#150;1968)")</script>, president of the Publishers' Association, on the grounds that booksellers and publishers, so often mutually suspicious, should be brought together in co-operation. At the 1932 Booksellers' Association conference Blackwell, at Unwin's request, had finally succeeded in persuading booksellers to support the book token scheme, which had originally been proposed by a publisher in 1928. In 1934 Blackwell invited Unwin to be joint host to an informal weekend conference of fifty booksellers and publishers in Ripon Hall, Oxford, the beneficial influence of which lasted for many years. At the end of his period of office Blackwell's reputation for approachability, concern for the welfare of the trade, and enthusiasm was such that he was affectionately nicknamed the Gaffer.<br>
<br>By 1938 the bookselling business was flourishing, with expansion into further premises and the establishment of a second publishing business, Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd. Contrary to the experience of the First World War, and to expectations, the sales of books greatly increased in the Second World War, and in 1945 B. H. Blackwell Ltd and its two associated publishing companies were well set. Blackwell's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30825/', "Richard Blackwell (1918&#150;1980)")</script>, returned from the war and in the course of the next twenty years gradually assumed responsibility and undertook modernization. Blackwell finally resigned the chairmanship after forty-five years in 1969 to become president, and handed on a business vastly increased, both in reputation and in size, although much of the credit for the post-war expansion overseas belonged to his son, Richard.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life, to within a week of his death, Blackwell continued to attend all board meetings as president, to peruse all accounting statements, and to visit the three main offices. He instinctively supported the attitudes and conventions of a previous age, working long hours in his office and supervising every detail. He believed in paternalism and it was his settled intention that Blackwells should remain independent and controlled only by those members of the family actively concerned with its management. He had the reputation of being one of the best-read people in the country. He wrote no books, but his letters and speeches were entertaining. He contributed the notice of J. G. Wilson to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>In 1941 Blackwell became a JP for Oxford, and in 1956 he was the first bookseller to be knighted. In 1959 he was elected an honorary fellow of Merton College. He was president of the Classical Association (1964&#150;5), and of the English Association (1969&#150;70). In 1979, on the hundredth anniversary of the founding of B. H. Blackwell Ltd, the University of Oxford made him an honorary DCL. He was also an honorary LLD of Manchester University (1965). But the distinction he cherished most was that of honorary freeman of the city of Oxford, conferred upon him in his eightieth year. Blackwell died of bronchopneumonia at his home, Tubney House, Tubney, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire, on 9 April 1984.<br>
