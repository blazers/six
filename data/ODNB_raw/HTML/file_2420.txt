<span class="headword">Binney,  Edward William</span>  (1812&#150;1881), <span class="occ">geologist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 7 December 1812 at Morton Hall, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, the youngest of the seven sons and two daughters of Thomas Binney (1762&#150;1835), landowner and maltster, and his second wife, Elizabeth Cross (<i>d</i>. 1843) of Gringley, Nottinghamshire. He attended four schools before being sent to Gainsborough grammar school at the age of seven. He was a good scholar, excelled at sports, and delighted in observing and collecting minerals and animals during long walks in the country. Although inclined to study chemistry which, like natural history, had attracted his attention since childhood, on his brother Mordecai's advice he left school at sixteen and began to study law.<br>
<br>In 1828 Binney was articled to a solicitor in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, where he continued to collect fossils, particularly from the coal measures. Here he came into contact with miners and began his lifelong appreciation of practical geology. In 1833 Binney moved to London after his refusal to abandon his whig sympathies with reform resulted in a clash with his employer. Often forced to work without remuneration, only with the help of Mordecai did he complete his legal training in London, qualify as a solicitor, and take chambers in Manchester in 1835.<br>
<br>On arrival Binney joined the Manchester Mechanics' Institution, and quickly made friends with John Leigh, with whom he read his first geological paper at the Literary and Philosophical Society in 1835. In 1838 he was active in founding the Manchester Geological Society, paying particular attention to the museum which he insisted should be free to the public, especially to working men. His numerous geological works were devoted primarily to the study of the coal measures, and he contributed to the controversial debate on the origin of coal, arguing for its marine formation from vegetation growing in shallow seas. He was elected fellow of the London Geological Society in 1853 and, through his work with Joseph Dalton Hooker on coal plants, of the Royal Society in 1856.<br>
<br>Although Binney's research interests were specific, his wider views on science shaped his political, philanthropic, and business concerns. Like Leigh he worked to improve the sanitary condition of Manchester, contributing to Lyon Playfair's <span class="italic">Second Report &hellip; into the State of Large Towns</span> (1845). His geologizing in mining areas led to his proposal to Joseph Brotherton MP that women be prohibited from working in pits. Disappointed by the failure of mechanics' institutes to inspire working-class interest in science, when Binney encountered the network of pub meetings held by Lancashire working men interested in natural history he did his utmost to promote this activity. Soon after his 1842 election to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, learning of the destitution of some artisan mathematicians and botanists, he attempted to establish a public society for &#145;the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 13 Dec 1843). Believing that conditions imposed by the Revd Richard Parkinson concerning the morality of the recipients scuppered the aims of this proposed society, Binney administered a private subscription fund from 1844, presenting donations at an annual dinner he gave for scientific artisans. In particular, he encouraged the shoemaker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4246/', "Richard Buxton (1786&#150;1865)")</script> to publish a Manchester flora in 1849 to which Binney anonymously contributed a geological preface, and defended him vigorously against competition from the botanist Leo Hartley Grindon, with whom Binney had several unpleasant skirmishes. Binney also helped the blacksmith Samuel Gibson, the radical reformer Samuel Bamford, and the electrician William Sturgeon, for whom he campaigned for a &pound;50 government pension.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Binney argued for the opening of museums on Sundays and stressed the social benefits of the practical pursuit of science by a wide range of participants. He thus opposed Owens College, founded in 1851, not for its educational aims but for the consequent exclusion of practical men and amateurs from science. He sometimes shocked others by the candid expression of his views, gaining a reputation for being a &#145;storm centre in Manchester scientific circles&#146; as Francis Nicholson recalled in <span class="italic">Memoirs and Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society</span> (58, 1913, 9).<br>
<br>Binney's career exemplified his belief in the essential connections between practical knowledge and science. He achieved enormous commercial success in collaboration with James Young and Edward Meldrum in their manufacture of paraffin from bituminous coals at Bathgate, Linlithgowshire, despite fighting several expensive legal challenges over patents. The partnership lasted from 1851 to 1864 and made a vast profit from three companies, as well as establishing the industrial foundation of the paraffin or shale oil industry in Europe, America, and Australia.<br>
<br>As his wealth accrued, Binney abandoned his legal profession. On 28 August 1856 he married Mary Christiana Jones (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter and coheir of the Revd David Jones; they had six children. In the 1860s, in addition to his home near Manchester, he purchased an estate, Ravenscliff, on the Isle of Man, and increased his investments through mining concerns in Scotland. He suffered a stroke when travelling between Douglas and Liverpool, and died eleven days later, on 19 December 1881, at his home at 11 Spring Bank, Crumpsall, near Manchester. He was buried in the Binney family vault at the abbey church, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, on 23 December.<br>
<br>Binney disliked clergy who opposed science but he claimed to enjoy a good sermon. He shunned the ostentation of polite society and was considered peculiar for enjoying the company of scientific working men. He devoted himself to institutional science in Manchester, serving as president of the Geological Society in 1857&#150;9 and 1866&#150;7 and of the Literary and Philosophical Society regularly between 1862 and 1881; James Prescott Joule presented a portrait of Binney painted by W. H. Johnson to the latter society. Binney was a large and imposing man, whose remarkable outspokenness was considered &#145;ungentlemanly &amp; disgusting&#146; by his enemies, but an indicator of honour, affection, and &#145;sterling nature&#146; by his friends, among whom the closest were Leigh, Joule, and John Harland. As his obituarist in the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner and Times</span> (21 December 1881) remarked, &#145;he was a strong friend although a good hater&#146;.<br>
