<span class="headword">Dorman,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1534&#150;<em>c.</em>1577), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and is of unknown parentage. His uncle, Thomas Dorman of Agmondesham in Buckinghamshire, funded his primary education under the protestant Richard Reeve. In 1547, under the auspices of Thomas Harding, he entered Winchester College. About 1550 he was made a probationer fellow of New College, Oxford, and in 1554 he was elected a full fellow of All Souls College, where he studied law, graduating BCL in July 1558. It seems probable that Dorman originally was inclined toward protestantism and only later, under the influence of Harding, embraced Catholicism. He left Oxford about 1561 and made his way to Louvain, where he pursued theological studies and received his BTh in June 1565. It was while in Louvain that he took up his pen on behalf of Harding against Bishop John Jewel.<br>
<br>Dorman's historical significance lies in his role as a member of the Louvain coterie of Catholic controversialists who mounted a massive response to Jewel's famous &#145;challenge sermon&#146; delivered at Paul's Cross in London on 16 November 1559. In this sermon Jewel boldly challenged his adversaries: if they could produce one authentic sentence from the fathers of the first six centuries demonstrating such practices as private masses, withdrawal of the cup from the laity, the universal authority of the bishop of Rome and transubstantiation, then he would personally subscribe to these teachings of the Catholic church. During the height of the controversy, from 1564 to 1568, the Louvain Catholics published forty-five separate volumes principally against Jewel. The vitriolic nature of the controversy derives in part from the personal animosity existing between former friends and colleagues at Oxford University who subsequently chose different sides in the Reformation debate.<br>
<br>All three of Dorman's books derive from this controversy. The first and most important book, <span class="italic">A Proufe of Certayne Articles in Religion, Denied by M. Juell</span> (1564), and dedicated to Thomas Harding, explicitly dealt with Jewel's &#145;challenge sermon&#146;. Dorman defended the Catholic cause on the whole range of issues raised by Jewel, but especially on papal authority. Jewel, in his <span class="italic">Defence of the Apology of the Church of England</span> (1562), three times mockingly cites Dorman's assertion that &#145;the Pope is the head and kings and princes are the feet&#146;  (Dorman, fol. 15.2). Jewel never responded directly to Dorman, but Jewel's close friend Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, did. In an exchange of five books over three years Nowell took it upon himself to answer Dorman's first work as well as his second, <span class="italic">A Disproufe of M. Nowelle's Reproufe</span> (1565). Dorman turned again to Jewel with his last book, <span class="italic">A request to Mr. Jewel that he keep his promise made by solemn protestation in his late sermon at Paul's Cross</span> (1567).<br>
<br>In 1569 Dorman joined William Allen at the English College in Douai. He continued to be identified as a threat as late as 1576, when Archbishop Edmund Grindal instructed the English clergy to be on watch for the writings of Thomas Dorman and the Louvain Catholics, whom he charged with denying, not only the protestant faith, but also Elizabeth's supremacy over the Church of England. In Dorman's later years he took a pastoral charge in the city of Tournai, where he died about 1577.<br>
