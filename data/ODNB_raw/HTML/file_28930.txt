<span class="headword">Webb,  Thomas William</span>  (1806&#150;1885), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 14 December 1806 at Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, the second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28924/', "John Webb (1776&#150;1869)")</script>, a clergyman and antiquarian, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harding (1776&#150;1849). His sister Anne Frances died, aged seven, in May 1807. Webb's childhood was spent mainly in Ross and Gloucester, where his father served at the cathedral. He was educated by his father, and lived with his parents in Tretire, Herefordshire, from 1812 until his marriage.<br>
<br>Webb was a competent draftsman and a precise and detailed observer. In his first notebook he recorded careful observations of spiders, but his interest soon moved to astronomy. He went to Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 8 March 1826 and received his BA degree with honours in mathematics on 2 June 1830. He took his MA and was elected a member of the British Association in Oxford in 1832. After being ordained deacon at Hereford Cathedral on 1 August 1830 he was appointed curate at Pencoyd, Herefordshire; he was ordained priest on 6 August 1831. For twenty-five years he served conscientiously in several parishes north of Ross-on-Wye, and as curate to his father. He was musical, played the organ, and installed the first instrument at St Weonard's in 1840. Webb was a minor canon and librarian of Gloucester Cathedral from 1844 to 1849 and a prebendary of Hereford Cathedral from 1882. In December 1856 he was invited to be vicar of Hardwick, a new parish near Hay-on-Wye, which he served attentively until his death.<br>
<br>Webb was a gentle man who possessed a wry sense of humour. He was shy, and when young used shorthand in his diary to disguise his unremarkable encounters with young ladies. At Troy House, Monmouth, he met Henrietta Montagu Wyatt (<i>d</i>. 1884), the daughter of the duke of Beaufort's agent; they were married at Mitcheltroy on 16 May 1843. Though the couple remained childless, they enjoyed long visits from nephews and nieces. Henrietta painted in watercolours and oils, and occasionally supplemented her husband's astronomical work.<br>
<br>As a young man Webb spent many hours making specula for his home-made telescopes. He became an expert in optics. From 1852 to 1866 he mainly used a Tully 3&frac34; inch refractor. Later he borrowed or purchased an Alvan Clark refractor (1859) and reflectors by With. He was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1852. His observational work was concerned principally with the moon, double stars and nebula, meteors, and comets, as meticulously recorded in a series of surviving notebooks, covering various periods from 1825 to 1874, and including a number on natural phenomena. He served on the British Association's moon committee, and was active in the Selenographical Society.<br>
<br>The Webbs entertained a wide circle of friends, including the diarist Francis Kilvert and the astronomers Espin, Ranyard, and Sadler. Young astronomers enjoyed Webb's generous and prolific correspondence. Webb edited and completed his father's books on the civil war in Herefordshire and the military memoirs of Colonel John Birch. He also collected many details of local and oral history. He wrote articles in several popular periodicals, including <span class="italic">Nature</span>, <span class="italic">Knowledge</span>, and the <span class="italic">English Mechanic</span>; in the last he contributed a regular column answering readers' astronomical queries. He also lectured at both the Ladies' College and working men's club in Cheltenham. He privately published <span class="italic">The Earth a Globe</span> (1865), a rebuttal of the flat earth theory of Samuel Burley.<br>
<br>Webb's charming and inexpensive <span class="italic">Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes</span> (1859) brought him enduring fame among the growing number of amateur astronomers. It ran to three editions during his lifetime, and the sixth edition of 1917 was reprinted in 1962. Whereas Admiral W. H. Smyth's expensive two-volume <span class="italic">Bedford Catalogue</span> (1844) was aimed at gentlemen able to obtain and house 5 inch refractors, Webb described all Smyth's double stars and nebulae within reach of a portable 3&frac12; inch telescope.<br>
<br>Webb died from a disease of the bladder at Hardwick vicarage on 19 May 1885 and was buried at Mitcheltroy. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Hereford Times</span> stated that he had &#145;probably induced more amateurs to interest themselves in the study of astronomy than any other man of his generation&#146;  (11 June 1885).<br>
