<span class="headword">Loat,  Lily</span>  (1879/80&#150;1958), <span class="occ">anti-vaccination activist</span>, was the daughter of John Loat. Her ancestors were Dutch weavers who moved to London at some time in the seventeenth century; Loats Road in Clapham Park, London, is named after them. Lily Loat attended Tiffin Girls' School in Surrey and became head pupil. The exact dates of her school attendance are unknown, but she joined the staff of the National Anti-Vaccination League in London shortly after leaving, in January 1898. The league had been formed two years before; the secretary answered an advertisement placed by Loat's shorthand teacher, and employed her to assist in answering correspondence. Loat did not oppose vaccination when taken on, but was quickly converted to the cause. The secretary resigned in 1908, and Loat was appointed titular secretary in January 1909; in the following month the council unanimously appointed her secretary.<br>
<br>Loat proceeded to dedicate herself wholeheartedly to the anti-vaccination cause and acquired a vast knowledge of the subject. Besides writing many of the league's pamphlets and leaflets, she edited its journal, the <span class="italic">Vaccination Inquirer and Health Review</span>, from 1932, and published a small book, <span class="italic">The Truth about Vaccination and Immunization</span>, in 1951. Her prose was concise, intelligent, and forcefully argued; she did not shrink from criticism but welcomed it, often engaging in correspondence with opponents. In addition to giving speeches at numerous British anti-vaccination meetings throughout her life (and addressing crowds in Hyde Park), she was invited several times to speak at meetings in Europe and America in the 1920s and 1930s. It is not known what caused Loat originally to alter her opinion about vaccination, but she employed a variety of arguments against treatment throughout her career. The most prominent of these were that vaccination caused disease&#151;either those diseases it intended to prevent, or others&#151;and that it was unsafe, ineffective, or unnecessary, and that to be forced by law to submit to it violated &#145;medical freedom&#146;.<br>
<br>Other objections expressed by Loat reveal her interest in related movements. She became an ardent anti-vivisectionist and animal welfare activist, and frequently condemned the cruelty involved in the production of lymph, and the testing of vaccines and inoculations on animals, in the pages of the league's journal and in speeches to anti-vivisection meetings. She also supported alternative medical treatments, particularly naturopathy; she believed that all illnesses were nature's attempt to rid the body of &#145;impurities&#146; which had accumulated as a result of heredity, bad habits, or environmental pollution. Hence she advocated sanitation as a way of preventing disease, and credited any statistical decrease in disease to public-health reforms. To her mind, vaccination failed to address the true causes of disease, and so was no defence against it; further, vaccination was offensive because it introduced impurities into a healthy body. Loat also opposed war, and wrote in 1932 that vaccination, vivisection, and war were inspired by the same &#145;motives&#146;.<br>
<br>Loat was indefatigable; memoirists recalled her prodigious memory, intellectual abilities, and devotion to the cause. She was also remembered for her warm personality and friendliness. She was in effect the public voice of the movement: a contemporary explained that &#145;when one thought of the Anti-Vaccination cause the name of Lily Loat automatically arose in one's mind&#146;  (Beddow-Bayly). She never married, and remained secretary of the league and editor of its journal until her death in 1958, continuing to work even when hospitalized by her last illness. Indeed, the centrality of Loat's role was such that a search for a replacement proved fruitless, which was said to have caused her great distress. She died in St Philip's Hospital, Westminster, London, on 16 August 1958, aged seventy-eight. The National Anti-Vaccination League published the last issue of its journal in the autumn of 1972.<br>
