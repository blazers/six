<span class="headword">Arne family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1682&#150;1808), <span class="occ">musicians</span>, became one of the most important musical and theatrical families of the eighteenth century. The foundations of the family's position were allegedly laid through the patriarchal persistence of <a name="cosubject_70963"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Arne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1682, <em>d.</em> 1736), <span class="occ">upholsterer and theatre servant</span>, who was baptized on 30 December 1682 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, the eldest of the six children of Thomas Arne (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1713) and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thursfield (1660/61&#150;1693). He married Mary Sharpe (<i>d</i>. 1703) before the baptism of their daughter Mary (<i>d</i>. 1704) at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 22 February 1703. In April 1707, at the Mercers' Chapel, London, he married his second wife, Anne Wheeler (<i>d</i>. 1757). They had seven children, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/674/', "Thomas Augustine Arne (1710&#150;1778)")</script>, Susannah Maria [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5417/', "Cibber, Susannah Maria (1714&#150;1766)")</script>], and <a href="#cosubject_70962">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a> reached adulthood. The children of this second marriage were brought up in their mother's Roman Catholic faith. During the reign of Queen Anne, Thomas Arne provided lodging for North American chieftains at his home and place of business, the Crown and Cushion, King Street, Covent Garden (now no. 34), as chronicled in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (no. 50) and <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> (no. 171). In 1715 Arne upholstered some seats in the Drury Lane Theatre. In 1732 he was connected with the season of &#145;English operas&#146; presented by Henry Carey and John Frederick Lampe at the Haymarket theatre, but it is not certain whether his involvement extended beyond taking in subscriptions. His daughter Susannah Maria sang in Handel's <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span> in the season. In 1735, testifying at the trial of Charles Macklin for the killing of Thomas Hallam, he identified himself as &#145;the numberer of the boxes, of Drury Lane playhouse&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Thomas Arne was buried at the age of fifty-three at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 17 June 1736.<br>
<br>Arne's children extended the family's influence in the theatre, not only through their talent but also by their marriages. Susannah Maria married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5418/', "Theophilus Cibber (1703&#150;1758)")</script> in 1734, and Thomas Augustine married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/672/', "Cecilia Young (1712&#150;1789)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69663/', "Young family (per. c.1700&#150;1799)")</script>], known professionally after her marriage as Mrs Arne, in 1737. The elder Thomas Arne's youngest child, <a name="cosubject_70962"></a><span class="headword">Richard Arne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> in or after 1736), <span class="occ">singer and actor</span>, was baptized on 15 February 1719 at St Paul's, Covent Garden. Billed as &#145;Master Arne&#146;, he sang the compositions of his distinguished brother, Thomas Augustine Arne, at the Haymarket and Drury Lane theatres, and appeared as Cupid to his celebrated sister's Venus in the <span class="italic">Impromptu Revel Masque, on the Joyous Occasion of the Royal Nuptuals</span> on 24 November 1733 at the Haymarket. &#145;Master Arne&#146; disappeared from the playbills after the 1735&#150;6 season. His death is not noted in the register of St Paul's.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_673"></a><span class="headword">Michael Arne</span>  (1740/41&#150;1786), <span class="occ">musical performer and composer</span>, was the illegitimate son, according to Burney, of Thomas Augustine Arne. His mother is unknown. He was brought up by his aunt Susannah Cibber. It has been suggested that he may have been the &#145;Master Cornel&#146; who performed the page in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span> at Drury Lane on 12 April 1746  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). If not, he made his d&eacute;but, as a singer, in Manfredini's concert on 20 February 1750. Billed as &#145;Master Arne&#146; from his benefit performance at the Haymarket on 5 February 1751, while still a child he excelled at the harpsichord, played his father's concerto on the organ, and sang the role of Paris to Mrs Arne's Juno in his father's setting of William Congreve's play <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span>. Like his father's, however, his fame rested on his composition of popular songs and music for the theatre. Over eighty publications of these works are listed in the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Printed Music Published between 1487 and 1800</span>. He wrote a &#145;New Sheep-Shearing Song&#146; which his aunt Mrs Cibber sang on 21 January 1756 in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> at Drury Lane, where, like his father, he was engaged as composer. He was elected to the Madrigal Society on 20 March 1765. He married Elizabeth Wright (1751/2&#150;1769), a Drury Lane singer, on 5 November 1766 at St Mary's, Lambeth, being entered as a widower in the register there; however, nothing is known of his previous wife. Although prized by Garrick, he temporarily left the theatre to study alchemy at a laboratory he built in Chelsea. Ruined by this, he returned to composing for the theatre. In 1770 he published several volumes of songs which he had written for his wife. He was in Germany in 1771 and 1772, and in Hamburg on 15 April 1772 conducted the first performance in Germany of Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>. On 1 May 1773 he married the soprano from this performance, Ann Venables, at St Giles-in-the-Fields. In December 1776 he accepted an invitation from Thomas Ryder to present and compose for David Garrick's <span class="italic">Cymon</span> at the Smock Alley theatre, Dublin. The production, featuring his wife, Ann, was successful, but despite this revival of his musical career he returned to alchemy and established a laboratory at Clontarf, co. Dublin, although the expense probably did not lead to him spending summer 1777 confined for debt in Dublin as sometimes reported. He had probably returned to London by 31 January 1778, when he was paid &pound;21 by Drury Lane for composing additional music for <span class="italic">Cymon</span>. Apart from a further Dublin engagement in 1779, he continued to compose for the London stage for several years, including two seasons at Covent Garden from 1781 to 1783. In April 1781 he composed the music for Philippe de Loutherbourg's picture show <span class="italic">The Eidophusikon</span>. Despite having been granted co-administration of his father's will on 21 March 1778 and half of the profits from future productions of his father's works, he was, according to Burney, &#145;always in debt, and often in prison&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). He died on 14 January 1786 at South Lambeth, London, leaving his third wife, Ann, and a daughter (by which marriage is not known), Sarah. Sarah, who may have been the granddaughter Jemima to whom Thomas Augustine Arne left 10 guineas in his will, continued the Arne family's connection with music and the theatre into the nineteenth century, singing first as Miss Arne and then as Mrs Gardiner. She died in 1808.<br>
