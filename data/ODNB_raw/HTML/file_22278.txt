<span class="headword">Pilkington,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was a member of the family long established at Rivington, Lancashire, and was perhaps nephew to James Pilkington, bishop of Durham from 1561 to 1576. He attended the grammar school at Rivington, appearing in its first extant register of 1575&#150;6, and was admitted as a scholar of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in May 1585, graduating BA in 1590 and proceeding MA in 1593. In 1595 he was ordained deacon (30 November) and priest (8 December) in the diocese of Carlisle, but on 27 May 1596 he was presented by a Lancashire neighbour, Thomas, Lord Scrope of Bolton, to the rectory of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>It appears, however, that Pilkington was not resident in Buckinghamshire, for in 1597 he was instituted to the rectory of Salkeld, Cumberland, and on 8 June the same year he was collated as archdeacon of Carlisle, probably at the behest of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18421/', "Bishop John May")</script> of Carlisle, whose daughter Anne he married about this time. Their son Abraham (who matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 1 June 1621 aged twenty) was born in 1600 or 1601; they also had a daughter who later married Thomas Hickman, Pilkington's curate. Pilkington had already resigned Salkeld in late 1599, vacating his archdeaconry before the collation of his successor on 6 February 1600. On 30 October 1599, as a member of Queen's College, he supplicated for incorporation in the degree of MA at Oxford; there he proceeded BD on 27 June 1600, and DD on 8 July, 1607. For more than thirty years until his death, Pilkington continued to hold the rectory of Hambledon; on 13 December 1609 he was licensed to hold it alongside that of a second benefice, unknown.<br>
<br>Pilkington became known for his controversy with Anthony Champney, a graduate of the Sorbonne, who had issued a controversial work in 1616. In his response, <span class="italic">Parallela</span>, Pilkington did not hesitate to assume the mantle of tradition, urging his readers to separate &#145;the dross from the gold, the popish novelties from ancient verities&#146;. He addressed his work to Archbishop George Abbot, &#145;who first encouraged me to this battle, and can best of all men judge (as the most experienced general in this sacred warfare) on which side the truth propendeth&#146;. Champney replied in 1620 with <span class="italic">Mr Pilkinton his Parallela Disparalled</span>, complaining that its author had met his short &#145;manual of controversies&#146; with &#145;a fowle great book of fifty sheets&#146;  (preface); <span class="italic">Parallela</span> had indeed run to more than 400 pages. In the year of Champney's reply Pilkington was presented to the rectory of Little Kimble, Buckinghamshire, by Edward Sergeant, lord of the manor and estate of that name. Pilkington was collated as treasurer of the diocese of Lichfield on 2 June 1625 but resigned in 1628; he had already been admitted to high office in the diocese of Lincoln, having been collated as archdeacon of Leicester on 1 August 1625, and installed by proxy on 16th of the same month.<br>
<br>Pilkington continued as archdeacon until his death; he died in September 1631 and was buried at Hambledon on 19 September. According to Anthony Wood, the ceremony was held during:<blockquote>the most dreadful storm of wind, thunder and lightning, as ever was known in those parts. It occasioned so great a darkness, that the neighbours were forced to convey the corpse to the grave by lights at four of the clock in the afternoon.</blockquote>It was reported that the violent wind &#145;moved and broke some of the stones that were to cover the grave and that it forced the shovel out of the clerks hand&#146;. These events occasioned &#145;certain odd reports&#146; of him to be made by the Catholics whom Pilkington had so strongly opposed during his lifetime  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.513).<br>
