</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowen, Sir  George Ferguson</span>  (1821&#150;1899), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, born in Ireland on 2 November 1821, was the eldest son of Edward Bowen, later rector of Taughboyne, co. Donegal. He was educated at Charterhouse School and as a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 June 1840. He was twice president of the Oxford Union. In 1844 he took a first class in classics, was elected a fellow of Brasenose College, and, on 27 May, entered Lincoln's Inn as a student; he never practised law, however. Bowen took his MA in 1847 and became for four years president of the Greek University of Corfu, from where he began a series of travels and publications reflecting his devoted interest in Greece and its surrounds. His <span class="italic">Ithaca in 1850</span> (1850) was accepted by contemporary Homeric scholars, including W. E. Gladstone, as proving Ithaca to be the island of Odysseus. His reputation was enhanced by <span class="italic">Mount Athos, Thessaly, and Epirus: a Diary of a Journey from Constantinople to Corfu</span> (1852). Knowledge of the region and its history was put to unusual and effective purpose in <span class="italic">Murray's Handbook for Greece</span> (1857). Nor were his activities merely literary: in 1848 he witnessed the capture of Vienna by the imperial troops, and in 1849 journeyed across Hungary, and thence, taking the risk involved in escorting refugees, to Constantinople; he also toured Albania and Montenegro.<br>
<br>In Corfu, Bowen became critical of the constitutional reforms instituted by the then lord high commissioner, Lord Seaton, attacking them in <span class="italic">The Ionian Islands under British Protection</span> (1850), a considerable work, and in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1852); following the latter, Seaton contemplated legal action. Approving rather of the controversial policies of Sir Henry Ward in the protectorate, Bowen (back at Brasenose since 1852, supporting university reform and Gladstone's re-election, and contributing leading articles to <span class="italic">The Globe</span> and other papers) was in 1854 appointed chief secretary to the lord high commissioner, and arrived in Corfu in March. Already fluent in Italian and ancient Greek, he mastered also modern Greek. Ionian agitation for incorporation with the Greek kingdom was then rife. On racial and cultural grounds, Bowen advocated cession of the southern islands to Greece and conversion of Corfu and Paxo into crown colonies; he wrote in this sense the relevant parts of a secret dispatch in 1856 from Sir John Young to Henry Labouchere, a copy of which, stolen from the Colonial Office in October 1858 and published in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in November, became a serious embarrassment to the British government, and to Gladstone, who was then on a mission to report on Ionian grievances. In 1855 Bowen was created CMG, and in 1856 KCMG (raised to GCMG in 1862). Also in 1856 he married the Countess Diamantina Roma, the daughter of the president of the Ionian senate, Count Candiano Roma of Zante, and related to Prince Danilo of Montenegro. This, as well as his views on Corfu, earned him a reputation of being involved to an unseemly extent in Ionian politics.<br>
<br>Bowen thus lost any prospect of realizing his ambition of becoming British minister in Athens; during Gladstone's mission he was even suspected, briefly, of giving information to newspapers. Instead, he was precipitated into a long career in the colonial service, which marks him as perhaps the most notable example of the professional governors who became the rule rather than the exception in the colonial empire in the second half of the nineteenth century. After looking first at Ceylon or Mauritius, and narrowly escaping Dominica, he was sent &#145;to preside over rising communities of my own countrymen&#146;  (Bowen to Gladstone, 21 April 1859, BL, Add. MS 44391), for, on 3 June 1859, thanks to Gladstone and his &#145;official friends&#146;  (ibid.), the secretary of state, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, appointed him first governor of Queensland. Bowen landed at Brisbane on 10 December 1859. Though preparing for responsible government, for the first three months he administered Queensland virtually as a crown colony, assisted by an official seconded from New South Wales and an executive council of three. He began also a seven-year association with Robert G. W. Herbert (later permanent under-secretary in the Colonial Office), who had travelled with him from England; the latter became colonial secretary and, on the election of the parliament in April 1860, the first premier of Queensland.<br>
<br>In Queensland, Bowen began to display the qualities which both distinguished and bedevilled his reputation. His attention to public business was constant, his capacity for administration (so far as that was required under responsible government) clear. His public utterances were lucid and usually edifying, if orotund. He dealt comfortably with ministers in ordinary circumstances. Government House hospitality was well maintained; in this he was much helped by the personality and talents of Lady Bowen. In touring over a large territory he was acutely observant as well as sociable, and in both dispatches and private letters he made much of classical and other historical parallels and comparisons: Homer and Horace, as well as seventeenth-century Virginia, provided him with descriptions of the landscape and squatters of Queensland. Public and political affairs engaged a perceptive and enquiring mind reinforced by wide reading in modern as well as ancient works. Bowen had, however, some less edifying qualities. He tended towards the pompous and egotistic, often to a fault. Some colonists regarded him less than respectfully, especially in times of political difficulty. In the Colonial Office he became known as &#145;an officer who is always obtruding and exaggerating his own merits and claims&#146;  (Sir F. Rogers, November 1865, TNA: PRO, CO 234/13). Robert Herbert, who maintained a certain friendship with Bowen (and was godfather to his son, George William Howard Bowen, born in Brisbane in 1864) in Queensland and later as head of the Colonial Office, was both amused and irritated by his &#145;eccentricities&#146;  (Knox, <span class="italic">Queensland Years</span>). Bowen was notable also for his propensity to cultivate and advertise acquaintance with the great and powerful (chiefly, at least until 1874, on the liberal side of politics). For one who was absent from England from 1859 to 1875, such acquaintance could only be made in correspondence. His surviving letters are ample evidence of his ability in this regard. A certain garrulousness and sycophancy aside, they contain much that is insightful and shrewd.<br>
<br>Bowen's success in his first government owed much to Herbert's ability to remain in office for six years. Their accord was especially valuable shortly after Herbert's retirement. In July 1866 a financial crisis struck Queensland as a result of the failure of a London bank. Heavily dependent on borrowed money, the government was unable to meet a range of commitments. The ministry proposed measures to which, Bowen informed them, his instructions forbade him to assent. Ministers resigned, and Bowen called Herbert to form a temporary administration. The crisis was survived by orthodox means, but, though the secretary of state approved, Bowen and Herbert encountered serious popular protests in Brisbane.<br>
<br>Late in 1867 Bowen was promoted to the government of New Zealand, where he assumed office on 9 February 1868. War with the Maori was still in progress. Bowen met chiefs in conference, made official tours through both islands, and received addresses and gave answers in patriarchal style; he perceived a parallel between the social condition of the Maori highlands and that of the Scottish highlands in the first part of the eighteenth century. He pursued a policy of conciliation, endeavouring to promote good feeling between the Maori and the settlers, hoping to mitigate the damage done by government confiscation of Maori land before and during the wars. His relations with the home government were less happy. In 1869 the Gladstone government decreed the removal of all British troops from New Zealand. Bowen strongly objected, in principle and on behalf of his government; in defiance of instructions he delayed the departure of the last regiment. He was rebuked by Lord Granville, the colonial secretary. The changed Colonial Office environment under Lord Kimberley, with Herbert as permanent under-secretary, helps explain why Bowen was nevertheless made, in 1873, governor of Victoria.<br>
<br>The governor's position in Victoria had been difficult ever since the start of the contests&#151;essentially &#145;property and intelligence&#146; against &#145;democracy&#146;&#151;between the houses of the legislature in 1865. Sir Charles Darling had been recalled for his partisan behaviour in relation to the &#145;deadlock&#146;, and serious differences had emerged between the colonial and British governments; more recently, Viscount Canterbury had disagreed with premier C. Gavan Duffy over a dissolution of the assembly. Bowen set out to establish harmonious relations between himself, his ministers, and the legislature, as well as with the population generally. In this, as in Queensland, he had the valuable assistance of Lady Bowen. He benefited also from becoming, in 1876, the first occupant of a new Government House which enabled the governor to entertain the political and social leaders of Victoria in unprecedented style; Bowen could boast that his residence was larger than its equivalents in either Calcutta or Dublin, and its ballroom larger than that in Buckingham Palace. He spent 1875, on his first furlough since 1859, visiting England, where he received the honorary degree of DCL from the University of Oxford on 9 June, and touring the United States and Canada. He met Sir John A. Macdonald and formed views on the differences between Canadian federation and any such development in Australia.<br>
<br>Bowen returned to a troubled colony. In 1877 the ministry attempted to provide &#145;payment of members&#146; by &#145;tacking&#146; the item to the general appropriation bill. The council, unable to amend such a bill, rejected it. Faced with serious financial deficiency, the government advised Bowen to sign orders dismissing large numbers of civil servants. Bowen relied on the opinion of Robert Herbert, who privately told him that he could accept the advice of his ministers, whatever it might be, even in financial matters. In Victoria, though a compromise was arranged, he was attacked by opponents of the ministry. Early in 1878, moreover, Lord Carnarvon resigned as secretary of state, and his successor, Sir Michael Hicks Beach, agreed with those who said that Bowen had been too ready to assist his ministers in a dubious policy.<br>
<br>Bowen's term of office in Victoria ended on 31 March 1879. He perceived his transfer to the governorship of Mauritius, rather than to Sydney, to which he had laid serious claim, to be a consequence of Hicks Beach's disapproval. After arriving in Port Louis on 4 April, he found that his administrative talents were in demand in a crown colony whose largest problems arose from the importation and employment of indentured Indian labourers. His and Lady Bowen's social activities continued, in a society which in some ways he found more cultivated than that of Victoria.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1882 Bowen was appointed to Hong Kong. In two years he reconstructed the colonial legislature, concerned himself with public works, and paid visits to China and Japan; the Franco-Chinese war of 1884&#150;5 occurred during his term of office. In 1885 ill health compelled him to return to Europe, and in 1887 he retired from the colonial service. In 1886 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Cambridge University and, on 26 November, was sworn of the privy council; in December 1887 he was appointed head of a royal commission sent to Malta to report on the arrangements connected with its new constitution. Bowen had been elected a member of the Royal Geographical Society in 1844, and served on its council from 1889 to 1892. He was a member of the Royal Colonial Institute, to which, in 1886, he read a paper, &#145;The federation of the British empire&#146;, which was published as a pamphlet and ran to two editions.<br>
<br>Bowen and his wife had a son and four daughters. The first Lady Bowen died on 17 November 1893; on 17 October 1896, at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, Bowen married (Letitia) Florence, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17120/', "Thomas Luby")</script> and the widow of Henry White. Bowen died at the Hotel Metropole, Brighton, on 21 February 1899, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 25 February.<br>
