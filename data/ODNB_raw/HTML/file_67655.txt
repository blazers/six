<span class="headword">Melachrino,  George Miltiades</span>  (1909&#150;1965), <span class="occ">conductor and composer</span>, was born at 57 Albany Street, London, on 1 May 1909, the eldest son of John Melachrino, a tobacco merchant, and his wife, Ellen Emms. The very versatile musician who was to have a great influence on British light music was something of a child prodigy and was playing on a small-sized violin when he was only four and performed in public when he was thirteen. He went to Trinity College of Music, London, at the age of fourteen, where he led a band, emerging four years later as an accomplished exponent of the violin, viola, oboe, alto and tenor saxophone, and clarinet, and as pianist and singer. He was one of the first musicians to broadcast from 2LO at Savoy Hill and became a leading light in British dance music, working with bands led by Mantovani, Ambrose, Jack Jackson, Jay Wilbur, and Carroll Gibbons at various times. He was given the opportunity to lead his own orchestra at the Caf&eacute; de Paris in London just before the outbreak of war in 1939. If, at first, it looked as if the war might be cutting short a promising career, it became a golden opportunity when, after touring with the Stars In Battledress company, he was chosen to lead &#145;The orchestra in khaki&#146;, which was made up of top professional musicians serving in the army. This became, in 1944, the fifty-piece British Band of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. As a result, and through regular wartime broadcasts that brought his music to the general public as well as the forces, he became known as one of the top British arranger&#150;conductors. He also sang with the equivalent United States and Canadian forces bands led by Glenn Miller and Robert Farnon.<br>
<br>After the war the band remained together, operating as two separate musical units, the full-scale Melachrino Orchestra and the Melachrino Strings, which tapped the same demand for mood music that helped Mantovani to his similar success. Melachrino achieved a worldwide reputation through regular broadcasts and recordings, and such albums as <span class="italic">Music for Dining</span>, <span class="italic">Music for Relaxation</span>, and <span class="italic">Music for Two People Alone</span> became best-sellers on the Decca, HMV, and RCA labels. There were later stereo LPs on ABC Paramount. He appeared with his full orchestra in the London Hippodrome show <span class="italic">Starlight Roof</span> (1947), which introduced Julie Andrews as a budding young singer. He wrote the score for this show including the novel and high spirited &#145;Starlight Roof&#146; waltz. He also ran the Melachrino Organization, one of the largest agencies for bands and orchestras in the country, and the provider of stage shows for MGM's Empire cinemas in the 1950s. He helped to found the Arcadia Publishing Company which promoted his own works as well as those of contemporaries like Ernest Tomlinson.<br>
<br>Melachrino's popularity was founded on the distinctive sound of the Melachrino Strings, an expanded orchestral form of the typical dance band score, breaking away from the usual classically orientated light music sound with scores that used the various tones of musical sections in a clearly spotlighted way, with distinctive harmonies, above a regular dance band type of rhythm. He was also a gifted composer in this same field and the traits outlined above were well demonstrated in the &#145;Starlight Roof&#146; waltz, as in &#145;Winter Sunshine&#146;, &#145;Woodland Revel&#146;, and his theme tune &#145;First Rhapsody&#146;. He also wrote film music, including that for <span class="italic">No Orchids for Miss Blandish</span> (1948) which the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> critic branded as the worst film he had ever seen.<br>
<br>Melachrino's career was sadly cut short at the age of fifty-six, when he drowned in his bath on 18 June 1965 at his home at 11 Gordon Place, Kensington. The coroner pronounced a verdict of accidental death.<br>
