<span class="headword">Deacon,  Pudentiana</span>  (1580/81?&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Benedictine nun and translator</span>, was the daughter of John Deacon of Middlesex. There are no records of her education but she was received into the Abbey of the Glorious Assumption of Our Lady in Brussels in 1607, so it is likely that her family were Catholics. The English agent for James I in Brussels described the profession:<blockquote>Here was yesterday a solemn professing of five Englishwomen to be nuns &hellip; [Albert and Isabella] did them honour to assist with their persons and the Pope's nuncio to sing the mass and to put their garments on them. The first in rank was Mrs. Morgan, who sometimes waited on the Countess of Sussex &hellip; the fifth one, Mrs. Deacon, that heretofore attended on the Lady Riche. (TNA: PRO, Flanders correspondence, fol. 279)</blockquote>Pudentiana was undoubtedly from a gentry family, since she attended on Lady Rich, but her social status was the lowest of the five nuns professed that day.<br>
<br>Deacon was received into the abbey on 11 July 1606, invested in holy habit on 23 April 1607, and professed on 29 April 1608, said to be aged thirty-two (though only twenty-seven or twenty-eight if her age given at death is correct). She was described as a &#145;regular person&#146;  (Neville, 9), suggesting her strict adherence to the abbey's rules. In 1623 she was sent with two other nuns to help with a new convent at Cambrai, Our Blessed Lady of Consolation, established directly under the Benedictines. The account of her life, responsibilities, and character is recorded in &#145;A Catalogue of the names of the religious Dames and Sisters professed of this convent&#146;:<blockquote>shee being a woman of a very good wit, judgement and understanding, was thought fit by her superiors and others to give help in a business of that consequence as the beginning of a monastery, which shee diligently performed, joyning a great zeal of regular observance with a motherly affection to all and care of all. (Gillow, &#145;Records&#146;, 77&#150;8)</blockquote>She held three key administrative roles: cellarer, mistress of the novices, and prioress. The latter two involved giving spiritual direction, and all required effective administrative skills.The convent was renowned for its translation work and for its manuscript and book collection. Deacon participated in this spiritual literary culture, translating Francis de Sales's <span class="italic">Les vrays entretiens spirituels</span>, from the French, as <span class="italic">Delicious Entertainments of the Soule</span>, published at Douai in 1632. Her name is not on the title-page but a seventeenth-century catalogue of the convent's library names her as the translator. Augustine Baker was spiritual director of the convent until 1633, and the nuns engaged in many translations under his direction. It is possible that Deacon was involved in other additional translations; Gillow names her as translator of <span class="italic">The Mantle of the Spouse</span>, although no supporting evidence confirms this. The prefatory address to <span class="italic">Delicious Entertainments</span> notes: &#145;the translatresse, a woman &hellip; had not much skill in the Frenche &hellip; never intending more than the use of a particular cloister, though God and her superiors have otherwise disposed of it&#146;  (sig. a2<i>r</i>). Nevertheless the translation is lucid and professionally finished. De Sales's treatise may have attracted her because it directly addresses sisters for their spiritual direction and education through contemplation.<br>
<br>Having fallen into &#145;great bodily infirmities which shee suffered with a remarkable patience &hellip; Her end was pious and peaceful in the 64 [year] of her age&#146;  (Gillow, &#145;Records&#146;, 77&#150;8). Deacon died on 21 December 1645 at Cambrai.<br>
