<span class="headword">McGillveray,  Angus</span>  (1930&#150;1996), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Dunmaglas, 46 Main Street, East Whitburn, West Lothian, on 13 October 1930, the elder of two sons of Joseph Charles McGillveray (1900&#150;1971), fruiterer, and his wife, Marion Prentice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Docherty (1902&#150;1981). Educated at Whitburn primary school (1935&#150;41) and Lindsay High School, Bathgate (1941&#150;5), he was apprenticed to John Laughridge, a local company of painters and decorators. After his apprenticeship he worked with them for two years before establishing his own firm of painters and decorators in 1955. On 29 March 1952 he married Jean Blair Brown (<i>b</i>. 1930), florist, at the Church of Scotland, Stoneyburn, West Lothian. They had a daughter, Janice, and two sons, Charles and Colin.<br>
<br>McGillveray was from his early years a great exponent of the culture of Scotland. A gifted artist, he also had special interests in piping and highland dancing. He arranged many fund-raising ceilidhs for cultural societies. He was responsible for holding in Bathgate one of the biggest highland dancing competitions in Scotland. It was to raise still more funds that he created a weekly sweep, called Saltire Pools, which benefited a wide range of cultural organizations.<br>
<br>McGillveray joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1952 when it was still a small organization with some 20 branches and a small membership. In the early 1960s the SNP began to grow. In 1962 it contested the West Lothian by-election and won over 23 per cent of the vote. The impetus given by this election boosted the SNP's national membership and prestige. It also created a power centre in West Lothian where McGillveray worked alongside the future party chairman, William Wolfe, to modernize the party. On his own initiative, McGillveray established a publications department in West Calder, which supplied leaflets, badges, and policy booklets to the party. By 1964 the SNP had 35 branches, and by 1970 the total had mushroomed to over 400. Membership had also gone through exponential growth. The whole organization was hungry for promotional material. During that period, McGillveray, by then head of the SNP's publications department, assisted by his wife, Jean, established a Scotland-wide network and sales reached into six figures. The famous <span class="italic">It's Scotland's Oil</span> leaflet (1973) sold over 1 million copies&#151;a stupendous figure for a country with 3 million households. In 1962, again on his own initiative and at his own cost, he adapted the formula of Saltire Pools to found the SNP's own version, Alba Pools. This was a runaway success. In its first five years, it raked in &pound;200,000. This money financed the explosive growth of the SNP and permitted the SNP at national level to set a high standard in research and publications new to Scottish politics.<br>
<br>McGillveray's organizational genius and marketing flair contributed critically to the emergence of the SNP as a major player in Scottish and United Kingdom politics. He was widely recognized as a mainspring of the leap forward. Additionally, he fought many local elections and served on the West Lothian district council. Although his family had lived in the lowlands for two centuries, he was proud of his highland origins and was open and welcoming by nature. He died in the house of his birth on 4 November 1996, after a courageous struggle over years against cancer, and was survived by his wife and their three children. There was a huge turn-out at his funeral, at Falkirk crematorium four days later, testifying to the affection and respect in which he was held.<br>
