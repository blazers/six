<span class="headword">Greenlaw,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1354&#150;1421/2), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Aberdeen</span>, is of unknown origins. He is probably first recorded in March 1374 under the name of Gilbertus Scotus, taking the degree of BA at Paris University by subdetermination, even though he was not a poor scholar; then on 27 April 1374, and this time without any doubt, since he is named as Gilbertus Greenlaw, he was a licentiate in arts. On the strength of these entries, he may be reckoned to have then been at least twenty years old. A few years later he was at least three times recorded with the title of master, but this designation appears to have been erroneous; indeed, he himself sought a papal grace of rehabilitation in October 1379 for having two years earlier misled the previous pope as to his degree.<br>
<br>From September 1377 at the latest Greenlaw held a canonry and prebend (that of Botary) of the diocese of Moray. In that month he was provided to the church of Liston, in the diocese of St Andrews, on the death of the previous incumbent, while by July 1386 he was a canon of Aberdeen, with an unknown prebend. Each of these benefices he retained until he was promoted to a bishopric. It seems that after leaving Paris he stayed for some years at the papal court, first at Avignon and then in Italy, for his first benefices were secured following the deaths of their incumbents at the curia. But he was certainly in Scotland in March 1378. When his rehabilitation was secured in October 1379 he seems to have been once more at Avignon. But he was clearly in Aberdeen no later than 1382, and in the following years occurs several times as a witness to land transactions in the diocese.<br>
<br>Following the death of Bishop Adam Tyningham, on 18 September 1389, Greenlaw was elected to succeed him; he obtained papal provision on 19 January 1390. He was apparently consecrated bishop in the following month, and held the see for the rest of his life. After his elevation, he is frequently recorded as working on diocesan business, securing his see's rights and witnessing further land transactions. It is also possible that about this time he was a papal collector in Scotland. But he also began to be active outside his diocese. From about the time of his elevation he started to appear at the king's court, where he witnessed a number of crown charters, although not at first so often as to suggest that he was a member of the king's daily council. This changed in May 1397, however, when he succeeded Duncan Petit as the royal chancellor, an office that he retained until his death.<br>
<br>As chancellor Greenlaw provided a significant degree of stability at the centre of government. Although he seems at first to have had links with the earls of Douglas, shortly before he entered upon high office he is found associating with Robert III's eldest son, David, earl of Carrick and later duke of Rothesay, in his efforts to preserve his marriage to the daughter of the earl of March, which the king opposed. But he also forged ties with the king's brother Robert, duke of Albany (a charter of whose he witnessed in November 1398), and worked with him to make Rothesay lieutenant of the realm in January 1399. Then, when Rothesay was overthrown by Albany about the end of 1401, Greenlaw continued to serve in the government of which Duke Robert had become head. He assisted Albany to resolve an awkward trading dispute between the burghs of Perth and Dundee in May 1402, and witnessed another of the duke's private charters in July 1404.<br>
<br>Following the death of Walter Danielston as bishop-elect of St Andrews in December 1402 Greenlaw was postulated by the cathedral chapter for translation there, certainly with the support of Albany, who in May 1403 secured for him a grant of the personal goods of the previous bishop, Walter Trail&#151;they included a silver crucifix containing part of the cross of St Andrew. However, the transfer was thwarted by the king, who in September 1403, as part of a reassertion of his authority, secured the see instead for Henry Wardlaw, who became temporarily a significant figure at court. But after the death of Robert III on 4 April 1406, when his son and heir Prince James was in captivity in England, Albany became governor of Scotland, and Greenlaw consolidated his position in the administration of the realm. The contemporary chronicler Walter Bower, abbot of Inchcolm, wrote that he was &#145;tenacious for justice, firm and calm in all his conduct&#146;  (Bower, 3. 411). And Hector Boece, in his early sixteenth-century lives of the bishops of Aberdeen, states that &#145;On account of his rare sagacity he possessed much influence amongst the nobles&#146;  (Moir, 28).<br>
<br>Greenlaw was for several years a regular witness of charters issued by Albany as governor, and was at least once appointed to a diplomatic mission, when in December 1406 he received a safe conduct to travel to England for peace negotiations; it is uncertain, however, if this embassy actually took place. He was not otherwise involved in the active diplomacy of the governorship, and it may be presumed that his absence on such business could not be tolerated. But, as a senior bishop, he must have been involved in the discussions from 1408 onwards of policy regarding the great schism within the church, and whether Scotland should continue to adhere to Pope Benedict XIII at Avignon, rather than to the Roman pope or to the third pope elected by the Council of Pisa in 1409. Ultimately Scotland remained loyal to Benedict until 1418, long after other countries had withdrawn from their allegiance to him.<br>
<br>It is indicative of Greenlaw's importance in government that until about 1415 it is difficult to find evidence for his undertaking business within his diocese. His rewards included the annual payment of a customs allowance of 20 sacks of wool or 40 merks (confirming a grant first made about 1404 by Robert III), and from <i>c</i>.1414 an annual gift from the customs receipts of Montrose. But after that date the evidence suggests that he was less often with Albany. By this time the latter was issuing fewer charters as governor, which creates uncertainty, but Greenlaw's name does not always appear in the surviving witness lists. He continued to act as an exchequer auditor to July 1421, but he also reappears undertaking business within his diocese. Boece suggests that Greenlaw went on an embassy to France, but no evidence survives to support this.<br>
<br>A fellow bishop, Walter Forrester of Brechin, seems to have been a good friend of Greenlaw. They were contemporaries as students in Paris, and their service to Robert III and to Albany more or less coincided, Forrester becoming secretary and later clerk register. In March 1422 Forrester mortified an annual rent secured on land in Aberdeenshire for celebrating masses to commemorate Robert II, Greenlaw, and Sir Adam Forrester of Corstorphine: a neat trilogy of master, friend, and family.<br>
<br>The exact date of Greenlaw's death is uncertain. The likeliest day is 20 September, when his anniversary was celebrated at Aberdeen. The tradition there was that he died in 1422, but as his successor was translated to Aberdeen in April that year, 1421 is the most probable year. Boece records his cause of death as an &#145;ethical fever&#146;, perhaps phthsis, and states that he was buried in the cathedral choir. He had given the treasures presented to him by Robert III to Aberdeen Cathedral, and they were still preserved there as late as 1549. A manuscript volume of miscellaneous tractates once possessed by Greenlaw is now held by the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, Germany.<br>
