<span class="headword">Topley,  William</span>  (1841&#150;1894), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 13 March 1841 in Greenwich, Kent, the son of William Topley and his wife, Carolina Georgina Jeans. He was educated at local private schools and entered the Royal School of Mines for three years' study in 1858. He was appointed assistant geologist to the geological survey of England and Wales in 1862 and started fieldwork in the weald of south-east England under the supervision of Clement le Neve Foster (1841&#150;1904). The survey of the weald had begun in 1855 under H. W. Bristow, and eventually involved nine geologists over a period of twenty years. Topley mapped the Hastings beds of the central weald as well as river deposits of the Darent, Stour, and Medway. His work on the river deposits led to an abiding interest in denudation, and to an important joint paper with Foster in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span> (1865) which gave convincing evidence that the land surface of the weald was shaped by rain and rivers rather than by the sea. He thus became part of a group of survey geologists, including Archibald Geikie, Joseph Jukes, and Andrew Ramsay, who opposed Roderick Murchison, then survey director, on this topic.<br>
<br>In 1867 Topley married Ruth Whiteman. The following year he was promoted to the rank of geologist and sent north to work in Northumberland under Henry H. Howell. There he mapped considerable areas of Carboniferous rock and the overlying glacial drift, and gave the name Rothbury Grits to one of the subdivisions of the Carboniferous Limestone. He also mapped part of the Whin Sill, and published a paper with G. A. Lebour demonstrating that it is an intrusion and not a lava flow. Between 1871 and 1874 Topley took what spare time he had to write up a comprehensive memoir on the geology of the weald from the notes left by the geologists who had worked on the project, seven of whom either were dead or had resigned from the survey. The work was published as a memoir of the geological survey in 1875, and is his chief memorial. In 1880 he was recalled to survey headquarters in Jermyn Street, London, to superintend the publication of maps and memoirs, and in 1893 he succeeded Edward Best with the entire charge of the office. Although not a great traveller, Topley paid geological visits to France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, and Algeria at different times.<br>
<br>Topley had many interests and commitments outside his official duties. He assisted with, and later edited, the enormously time-consuming <span class="italic">Geological Record</span>, he was secretary to the geological section at fifteen meetings of the British Association between 1872 and 1880, and sat on the committee on sub-wealden exploration, and on that enquiring into the rate of erosion of sea coasts. Topley was president of the Geologists' Association from 1885 to 1887 and was secretary of the London International Geological Congress in 1888, in which capacity he contributed to the congress's geological map of Europe. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1888. He was also interested in the engineering aspects of geology, and published on landslips and on plans for a channel tunnel, as well as in mineral resources and water supply. The relationship of water supply to human health also concerned him, and he lectured to the Sanitary Institute Congress on geology in its relation to hygiene in 1890. Finally, the influence of geology on agriculture had interested Topley since his early work in the weald, and he published papers on the agricultural geology of that area (1872) and on the comparative agriculture of the counties of England (1871). Topley died at his home, 13 Havelock Road, Croydon, on 30 September 1894 of disease thought to have been caused by drinking contaminated water while in Algeria.<br>
