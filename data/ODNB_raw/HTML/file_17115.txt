</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loyd,  Samuel Jones</span>, Baron Overstone  (1796&#150;1883), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 25 September 1796 at 43 Lothbury, in the City of London, the only child of the Revd Lewis Loyd (<i>d</i>. 1858), a nonconformist clergyman and banker, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1821), the daughter of John Jones, a Manchester banker and manufacturer. Lewis Loyd came from a Carmarthenshire family and it was probably he who was responsible for the change in the family name from Lloyd to Loyd. Having given up his ministry, Lewis Loyd was employed at the Manchester bank owned by Jones, and in 1793 married his daughter.<br>
<br>Lewis Loyd proved to be a brilliant banker and, together with his brothers-in-law, Samuel and William Jones, was one of the founders of Jones, Loyd &amp; Co. Loyd moved to London to establish a branch office there, and went on to transform a small country bank into one of the leading private banks in the country. After the death of Sarah, he married again, and increased his already large fortune considerably. He retired from business and bought Overstone Park, and an estate of 15,000 acres, near Northampton; in 1854 he also acquired the manor of East Lockinge in Berkshire. Lewis Loyd died in 1858 at the age of ninety-one, leaving an estate of several million pounds.<br>
<br>Samuel Jones Loyd was born over the bank's premises in the heart of London. His birth was registered with the Unitarians at Dr Williams's Library, but he was brought up a member of the Church of England. He was educated privately before going to Eton College (<i>c</i>.1808&#150;<i>c</i>.1813). He then spent some time as a private pupil with C. J. Blomfield, later bishop of London, before going on to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1818, but had already become a partner in his father's bank, being admitted on 26 December 1816. His father retired in 1844 and the Manchester and London businesses were formally divided in 1848. In 1819 Loyd was elected liberal member of parliament for Hythe, by a majority of sixty-seven, remaining member until 1826, when he did not offer himself for re-election. In December 1832 he stood for Manchester, but was defeated, coming third in the poll. He never again stood for parliament.<br>
<br>In 1829 Loyd married Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1864), daughter of Ichabod Wright, a Nottingham banker. They had two children, a son who died aged only three months, and a daughter, Harriet Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1837), who married Robert Lindsay in 1858 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57476/', "Lindsay, Harriet Sarah Loyd-")</script>]; at their marriage the Lockinge estate was settled on the couple. Samuel Loyd's wife died in November 1864, and it is clear from his surviving correspondence that he was overwhelmed with grief.<br>
<br>Samuel Loyd exhibited great skill as a banker, and the continued profitability and development of the bank's business was largely due to him. It has been estimated that between 1817 and 1848 the bank returned profits of &pound;2.2 million, &#145;of which Overstone collected &pound;563,000 or an average of &pound;18,161 per annum as his share&#146;  (Michie, 60). Nevertheless, as a practising banker he was always very cautious, carefully weighing risk, especially on loans, with the result that during the years of his association with his bank it never made a loss. At the same time, however, it slowly stagnated, as he refused to countenance the changes in banking practice which were taking place in the 1840s, his real interests lying in currency theory. Thus he always remained opposed to the joint-stock principle, believing it would reduce the personal element in banking and that joint-stock banks did not keep stable reserve ratios. He also remained committed to unlimited liability, thinking this would induce a proper caution in a banker's activities.<br>
<br>In 1831 Loyd was elected a member of the Political Economy Club, remaining a member until 1872, when he was chosen as an honorary member. Also in 1831 he was appointed an exchequer bill commissioner and in 1832 he appeared before the select committee on the renewal of the charter of the Bank of England. In 1837 he published his first pamphlet, <span class="italic">Reflections suggested by a perusal of Mr. J. Horsley Palmer's pamphlet on the causes and consequences of the pressure on the money markets</span>, which recognized the importance of psychological factors on the trade cycle. The pamphlet was very well received and marked Loyd's d&eacute;but as an influential figure in banking and financial circles. Between 1837 and 1840 he was a member of the commission on hand-loom weavers, and in 1838 he appeared before the select committee on postage. Further pamphlets on currency matters appeared in 1840, including <span class="italic">Remarks on the Management of the Currency</span>, in which he strongly defended convertibility.<br>
<br>In 1844 Loyd's <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Separation of the Departments of the Bank of England</span> appeared. This work had been privately printed in 1840, and was particularly influential. It made Loyd the chief spokesman of the currency school of monetary theorists. In it he advocated a single bank of issue of paper money, as well as the separation of the banking and issue departments of the Bank of England. The proper function of the Bank of England was, in his opinion, to regulate the amount and secure the solidity of the paper issues, and to afford a safe place of deposit for government and public money. Loyd undoubtedly influenced the content of Sir Robert Peel's <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> of 1844, for his views were closely reflected in the terms of the act. He had appeared before the select committee on banks of issue in 1840, and was able to put his views before Sir Robert Peel, who attended meetings regularly. The act provided for the division of the Bank of England into an issue department and a banking department, as Loyd had proposed, and prohibited the issue of bank notes by anyone who was not already an issuer. Loyd came to feel an almost personal responsibility for the act and its workings, so that the suspension of the act during the financial crisis of 1857 disturbed him greatly.<br>
<br>Loyd now commanded wide public respect, but consistently refused all invitations to stand again for parliament. His advice was widely sought, for example by Lord John Russell, and by Sir Charles Wood, later first Viscount Halifax, who consulted him for thirty years and, on becoming chancellor of the exchequer in 1846, openly acknowledged his debt to him. In 1846 he became chairman of the British Association for the Relief of the Extreme Distress in Ireland and Scotland, making his own considerable personal contributions to the funds of the association.<br>
<br>In October 1849 he was offered a peerage by Lord John Russell, for whom he had considerable respect. He was both surprised and dismayed at this offer, and took a fortnight to decide to accept; it was March 1850 before he took his seat in the House of Lords. He rarely spoke in the house, but served on a number of select committees, including that on the Turner and Vernon bequests. In 1850 he became a trustee of the National Gallery, and he was one of the commissioners for the Great Exhibition of 1851. His interest in art was genuine, and he formed his own collection of paintings, which included works by Ruysdael, Hobbema, Rembrandt, Lorrain, Murillo, Cuyp, Crome, and Stanfield.<br>
<br>A member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in June of 1864 Loyd was created honorary DCL by the University of Oxford. He was a member of the commission appointed to consider decimal coinage, to which he was always strongly opposed. He became a member of the council of the University of London in 1828, serving until 1844. He was a member of the senate of the university from 1850 until 1877, when he resigned in opposition to proposals to award degrees to women.<br>
<br>Loyd gave up direct involvement in banking upon his elevation to the peerage. When the other partners wished to retire the two branches of his bank were taken over by joint-stock companies, the Manchester branch in 1863 by the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank and the London branch by the London and Westminster Bank in 1864. As his interests in banking and currency matters receded, so he became increasingly interested in the management of his estates. Loyd bought 5000 acres at Wing, in north Buckinghamshire, and rebuilt the house at Overstone, employing the architect William Milford Teulon. He also spent much money on improving the dwellings of the agricultural labourers on his estates.<br>
<br>In his last years Loyd became increasingly conservative and withdrew more and more from public life. His eyesight began to fail, and for at least the last two years of his life he seems to have been confined to a wheelchair. His religious beliefs became steadily more austere, and he became more and more lonely and dependent upon his daughter, spending much of his time with her at Lockinge. Nevertheless, he retained a strong sense of humour. He died peacefully on 17 November 1883 at his London home, 2 Carlton Gardens, a house which he had bought from the widow of William Huskisson, shortly after that MP's death. He was buried at Lockinge beside his wife. The prince of Wales sent a letter of condolence to his daughter, and Queen Victoria was represented at his funeral. He left securities valued at &pound;2,118,084 and landed property worth &pound;3,114,262, making him one of the wealthiest men in the country at that time.<br>
<br>The important role that Loyd played in banking reform was well described in a <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary, which also mentioned that he was<blockquote>one of those men who in a measure outlive their reputation as they survive their contemporaries. He did his country most valuable service in his time but the time was long ago &hellip; and it is nearly a quarter of a century since his name has come prominently before the public.</blockquote>The obituary continued, however:<blockquote>in the fulness of his practical knowledge he submitted the whole of our banking system with its subsidiary monetary questions to a severely scientific analysis, bringing theories and ideas to the test of experience, drawing logical deductions from closely sifted premisses, and marshalling deliberate conclusions in his mind with a wonderful lucidity of method. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Nov 1883)</blockquote>
