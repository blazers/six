<span class="headword">Chase,  Frederic Henry</span>  (1853&#150;1925), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, the only son of the Revd Charles Frederic Chase, rector of St Andrew by the Wardrobe and St Anne Blackfriars, and his wife, Susan, daughter of John Alliston, was born at St Andrew's rectory, Blackfriars, on 21 February 1853. He was educated at King's College School, London, and proceeded as a scholar to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated as eighth classic in the tripos of 1876. He was ordained deacon in 1876 and priest in 1877. In that year he married Charlotte Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1928), daughter of the Revd George Armitage, vicar of St Luke's, Gloucester; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Chase gained pastoral experience as curate of Sherborne, Dorset (1876&#150;9), and of St Michael's, Cambridge (1879&#150;84). From 1881 to 1890 he was lecturer in theology at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and at Christ's College from 1893 to 1901. He was also principal of the Cambridge Clergy Training School from 1887 to 1901. In the latter year he was elected president of Queens' College, and appointed Norrisian professor of divinity at Cambridge, a post which he held until 1905. He was vice-chancellor of the university from 1902 to 1904.<br>
<br>When J. Armitage Robinson founded in 1891 the theological series entitled <span class="roman">Texts and Studies</span>, Chase contributed to the first volume a study, &#145;The Lord's prayer in the early church&#146;. In 1900 he wrote for Hastings's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span> three important articles&#151;on St Peter (Simon), and on the two Petrine epistles. Chase's Hulsean lectures, <span class="italic">The Credibility of the Book of the Acts</span>, delivered in 1900 and 1901, were published in 1902 with important additions. These lectures are, perhaps, the most attractive of his works. His heart was in the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>, and had leisure been granted him he would have edited the book for the <span class="roman">International Critical Commentary</span>. Even as bishop of Ely he continued to contribute articles on <span class="roman">New Testament</span> subjects to the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>.<br>
<br>Chase was appointed bishop of Ely in 1905, continuing to be president of Queens' College until 1906. He threw himself into his new work with great energy. His diocese was at first very large, including Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, and the western half of Suffolk (565 benefices). But in 1914 Bedfordshire was transferred to the diocese of St Albans, and west Suffolk to the new diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich.<br>
<br>The bishop of Ely, however, still retained the oversight of 300 benefices and 360 clergy. Moreover, the revision of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> was in progress, and an important share in the work fell to Chase, who was trusted both for his learning and for his cautious judgement. In his primary visitation in 1910 he gave as his opinion that it was &#145;advisable that the Church should go forward slowly, cautiously, and deliberately in this confessedly difficult and anxious task&#146;  (F. H. Chase, <span class="italic">A Charge Delivered &hellip; on the Occasion of his Primary Visitation</span>, 1910). Besides taking his share in the work as it came before the convocations, Chase served on the three committees which revised respectively the lectionary (of this he was chairman), the translation of the prayer book psalter, and the office for holy baptism; he also served on a fourth committee, which drew up a &#145;Form and manner of making deaconesses&#146;. He took a special interest in the ministrations of women. His labour was not lost through the rejection by the House of Commons of the prayer book measure of 1927&#150;8. The revised psalter was taken into the revised prayer book of the Church of Ireland, while the new baptismal office and the service for the institution of deaconesses were both used in England.<br>
<br>In the much debated question of an alternative office for holy communion, Chase again showed his Christian statesmanship. His speech in the upper house of the convocation of Canterbury on 11 February 1920 is a noteworthy utterance. He concluded that the new service was &#145;true to liturgical principles, and to the thought and doctrine of the present prayer book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of the Convocation of Canterbury</span>, sessions of February and April 1920, 73&#150;5).<br>
<br>Chase did not live to see the rejection of the book on which he had bestowed so much labour. In 1924 he resigned his see and retired to Woking, where he sought a renewal of his health. He died at the Normanhurst Hotel, Bexhill, Sussex, on 23 September 1925, leaving behind him the reputation of a learned theologian, a conscientious administrator, and a faithful friend.<br>
