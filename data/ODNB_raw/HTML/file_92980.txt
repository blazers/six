<span class="headword">Allington,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1446), <span class="occ">administrator and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, moved from Cornwall to Horseheath in Cambridgeshire in the 1390s. Probably the son of William Allington and Denise Malet, and a relation of Master Robert Allington, chancellor of Oxford University (1393&#150;5), he first came to the court of Richard II as a member of the retinue of John Holland, successively earl of Huntingdon and duke of Exeter, the king's half-brother, under whom he served as receiver of the English garrison at Brest in 1397 and as treasurer of Calais in 1398. When Holland accompanied the king to Ireland in April 1399 Allington looked after his affairs at home. Nevertheless he had little trouble in accommodating himself to the deposition of Richard II and avoided implication in Holland's treason against Henry IV in January 1400. A king's esquire by November 1399, Allington was soon employed in the administration of Cambridgeshire, as an escheator and JP, and achieved an assured position in the royal service by joining the household of the king's second son, Thomas (later duke of Clarence). In 1403&#150;4 he was treasurer of the exchequer of Ireland during the prince's lieutenancy, going on to hold the office again from 1406 until 1413, although mainly discharging his duties by deputy. Allington's connection with Prince Thomas remained close, and when an MP in 1410, representing Cambridgeshire, he perhaps helped to provide a counterbalance to the then predominant party led by the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>While Clarence was overseas in 1412&#150;13 and accompanying Henry V's invasions of France in 1415 and 1417, Allington organized the dispatch of supplies to his army, supervised his affairs, and acted as a trustee of his estates. Probably on Clarence's recommendation he became a member of the council that assisted the duke of Bedford in the government of England during the king's absence. Allington was called to Normandy for diplomatic and administrative rather than military employment in July 1418, and was named that October and again in January 1419 as an envoy to treat with the French for peace. In May 1419, three months after the fall of Rouen, he was put in charge of the finances of the Norman duchy as treasurer and receiver-general, his authority being extended subsequently to keep pace with fresh acquisitions of territory. His exacting office earned him a salary of 12<i>s</i>. a day, and royal grants of houses at Harfleur and Honfleur, land in the <i>vicomt&eacute;</i> of Caen, and a handsome annuity of &pound;100. To this Clarence added a gift of estates in the vicomt&eacute; of Pont Audemer. Allington's role also involved him in diplomatic business, notably in revising the conditions of the truce with Brittany. He was retained in office after Clarence was killed at Baug&eacute; on 22 March 1421 (then being made custodian of the castle and town of Caen, his own financial headquarters), but was dismissed after Henry V's death on 31 August 1422.<br>
<br>Allington continued to be busy over the next few years as Clarence's feoffee and executor. Henry VI's minority council appointed him sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1423 and in January 1424 formally co-opted him into its ranks, with an annual fee of &pound;40, a promotion perhaps owed to Bishop Henry Beaufort and Ralph, Baron Cromwell. He also retained links with the family of his first patron, subscribing 200 marks towards the ransom of John Holland's son and namesake. Following Allington's election to parliament for Cambridgeshire for the third time in 1429 (he had also sat in the brief autumn parliament of 1416), the Commons chose him as speaker, a choice no doubt inspired by his position as former head of the financial administration of the English conquest in France, since the defence and financing of English interests overseas were matters of great concern. While the parliament was in session Henry VI was crowned at Westminster Abbey, and it was decided that he should cross to France to be crowned there as well.<br>
<br>Allington married Joan (<i>d</i>. 1446), whose maiden name was probably Burgh; in the 1420s he arranged lucrative matches for his sons, William and Robert, who married two sisters, the granddaughters and coheirs of the wealthy Sir William Argentine of Great Wymondley, Hertfordshire. Whereas his own landed acquisitions had given him an annual profit of at least &pound;40, these marriages provided his family with estates worth &pound;170 p.a. or more. He retired from local administration in 1439, and, having made a will on 20 September 1446, died on 19 October. The inscription on his monumental brass in Horseheath church described him as sometime treasurer of Ireland and Normandy. His son William also sat in parliament three times for Cambridgeshire, and his grandson, another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92984/', "William Allington")</script>, emulated him by acting as speaker in 1472 and 1478.<br>
