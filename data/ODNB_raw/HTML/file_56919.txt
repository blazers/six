<span class="headword">Kennedy,  William Quarrier</span>  (1903&#150;1979), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 30 November 1903, at the Orphan Homes of Scotland in Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, the youngest of five children of John Gordon Kennedy, headmaster of the Orphan Homes school, and his wife, Peterina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Webster. He had a happy childhood at their riverside home; he idolized his father (a stern Presbyterian who made his family go to church twice on Sundays). It was his father and his elder brother Ian who first made him interested in sciences and literature, especially poetry. He was educated at his father's school and at Glasgow high school, and he entered Glasgow University in 1921 to study agriculture. He graduated in 1926 and he proceeded to an honours degree in geology, graduating with first-class honours in 1927. While a student, Kennedy obtained a Royal Society grant for cave exploration, which led to his first geological publication in 1930. He was a member of council of Glasgow University Geological Society, probably his only ever service on a scientific society council.<br>
<br>On graduating, Kennedy won a J. R. K. Law scholarship for research in applied sciences abroad; he chose Z&uuml;rich Technische Hochschule. He studied magnetite deposits in Traversella, Piedmont, under Professor Paul Niggli. On his return to England (fluent in German), he applied for a post with the geological survey. Offered appointment in September 1928, he reported at the Edinburgh office the following day, thus joining a group including such outstanding geologists as E. B. Bailey (1881&#150;1965), J. E. Richey (1886&#150;1968), and H. H. Read (1889&#150;1970). Kennedy was assigned to geological mapping in the midland valley and in the highlands.<br>
<br>During his career Kennedy developed two main geological interests; in the Precambrian Moine rocks of the west highlands, and in the processes by which volcanic rocks of the midland valley and Western Isles evolved in the mantle and lower crust. Both were discussed in papers of major significance, and systematically described on geological maps and in memoirs. He made the spectacular discovery of a 65 mile wrench on the Great Glen fault, and recognized the simple domal pattern (displaced by the fault) of metamorphic zones in the highlands.<br>
<br>In 1945 Kennedy left his beloved Scotland to become professor of geology at Leeds University. The department there had concentrated on northern England geology; Kennedy shifted its research emphasis to petrogenesis, tectonics, and global problems. Disliking committee work, or answering letters, he nevertheless obtained staff, equipment, and eventually a new building for a department of earth sciences, which incorporated geophysics, geochemistry, and geology. He attracted a thriving group of research students, for he was an inspiring teacher and a lucid lecturer, and he was always happy to discuss problems with students.<br>
<br>In research, Kennedy continued to think about Scottish problems. In 1953 he read a paper to the Geological Society reinterpreting the Morar structures, an interpretation which was initially rejected and which led to Kennedy's shunning the society thereafter. Later, John Sutton (1919&#150;1992), one of the chief dissenters, acknowledged that Kennedy was right.<br>
<br>In 1951 Kennedy and the Uganda geological survey jointly led an expedition to the formidable Ruwenzori range. However, owing to the complexity of the geology, and the small scale of the expedition, no report resulted. Becoming increasingly interested in research and mineral exploration in Africa, Kennedy established contacts with mining companies. A chance meeting with Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, head of Anglo-American Corporation, resulted in 1955 in the establishment at Leeds of a research institute of African geology, funded by the corporation. Thereafter Kennedy concentrated on African research, initially on Karoo volcanics and mineralization in eastern Rhodesia, on geochemical provinces and minerals in pegmatites, younger granites, and kimberlites.<br>
<br>In 1960 Kennedy spent time in hospital: after a leave of absence from 1965, he retired in 1967. Apart from a brief visiting lectureship at St Andrews and a few papers, ill-health ended his scientific work. Nevertheless his contribution had been outstanding. Through his career he had gained many honours, including the Geological Society's Bigsby (1948) and Lyell medals (1967), the Geological Society of Edinburgh's Clough medal (1966), and fellowships of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1948) and the Royal Society (1949).<br>
<br>Kennedy's personal life reflected his temperament; H. H. Read called him sensitive as a ballet dancer. He had an unassuming charm, interest in people, and humility. His first marriage, on 3 October 1933, to Elizabeth Jane Lawson McCubbin (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), daughter of Thomas McCubbin, structural engineer, began with &eacute;clat; they had a son and two daughters. However, it ended unhappily with separation. After some years of loneliness in his house in Leeds, he married Sylvia Margaret Grieves in 1962; they were happily married and had two children. On his retirement they moved to Elie, Fife. Despite pneumonia and ill-health, he enjoyed golf, gardening, and the odd flutter. He died peacefully, in Harrogate, on 13 March 1979.<br>
