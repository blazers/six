<span class="headword">Somerset,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1454), <span class="occ">physician and courtier</span>, was a Londoner by birth. His origins are obscure, although he may have been related to Robert Somerset, a London draper active during the late fourteenth century. That his sister, Alice, became prioress of Wintney, Hampshire, while he himself attended Oxford University, suggests a comfortable background. Fear of plague led him to move to Cambridge before 1410, when he appears as a fellow of Pembroke College. By 1418 he had graduated as master of arts and bachelor of medicine, qualifications which brought rapid preferment. Thomas Beaufort, duke of Exeter, made him master of the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds; and just five years later he was named as a governor of a proposed joint college of medicine and surgery in London. So also was the eminent royal surgeon, Thomas Morstede (<i>d</i>. 1450), who attended Beaufort with him, in December 1426, during the duke's last illness.<br>
<br>Such connections found Somerset a place in the household of Henry VI, where he served continuously from Easter 1427 until about 1451. Early in 1428, in response to the first of many complaints about poverty, he was promised fees worth &pound;100 a year. By then a doctor of medicine, whose duties included tutoring the young king as well as &#145;preserving his health&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1429&#150;36</i>, 241), his influence was incalculable. He spent nearly two years with Henry in France between 1430 and 1432, probably then earning the great reputation as a physician about which he was later to boast. A note, in his hand, in the Bedford book of hours, records its presentation to the king in his presence at Rouen on Christmas eve 1430.<br>
<br>Fur-trimmed robes were regularly assigned to Somerset from the royal wardrobe throughout the 1430s and 1440s, marking his arrival at the pinnacle of his profession. He secured gifts of cash and goods, corrodies, an additional fee of &pound;40 a year, and land in Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire. In 1437 part of his pension was exchanged for the manor of Ruislip in Middlesex, prompting him to acquire an additional estate of over 750 acres and a mansion nearby at Osterley, where he lived as a country gentleman when not at his London residence. Most English physicians took holy orders, but Somerset was twice married, first to Agnes, by the early 1440s, and then, by February 1448, to Alice; and in 1442 he became the first medical practitioner to sit in parliament, as a shire knight for Middlesex. He served on the county bench, discharged many royal commissions, and acted as keeper of various royal properties. The chancellorship of the exchequer and wardenship of the royal mint, awarded in 1439, further increased his authority.<br>
<br>Medical training made Somerset an expert astrologer; and in 1441, when horoscopes had been used by a group of conspirators to forecast the king's early death, he arranged for counter-propaganda to be produced. Henry's secretary, Thomas Beckington (<i>d</i>. 1465), a close friend, enlisted Somerset's support during royal marriage negotiations, one year later, while the king sought his advice on educational projects. Somerset helped to draft the statutes of both King's and Queens' colleges, Cambridge, and was also involved in the running of Eton College, near Windsor. He did not, as has been suggested, compose a manual on <span class="italic">The Rule of Princes</span>, but he was an avid bibliophile, who wrote and collected medical treatises. Some may have been acquired dishonestly: after the death in suspicious circumstances of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, in 1447, he was made administrator of the duke's estate and incurred considerable opprobrium for failing to hand over part of the ducal library to Oxford University.<br>
<br>Somerset sold his office as warden of the mint at this time, allegedly under pressure from William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, who, he maintained in a later petition, held him &#145;not gretely in luf and affeccion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C1/19/65). But this was after Suffolk's fall and death in 1450, when Somerset himself had been satirized as the duke's creature and parliament had demanded his removal, as an undesirable influence, from the royal presence. His claim in the same petition never to have taken &#145;brybes for forderaunce of men&#146;  (ibid.), is belied by the fact that in 1445 the rulers of London assigned &pound;66 in cash and a substantial lifetime annuity to him for &#145;labour with the king&#146;  (CLRO, Journal 4, fol. 84<i>r</i>) on their behalf. Yet protestations that he spent much of his wealth on charity ring true. In 1446 Henry VI permitted him to found a hospital and religious fraternity at Brentwood; and a fulsome eulogy then addressed to him by an anonymous chronicler dwells upon his concern for the poor.<br>
<br>Although he was not immediately expelled from court, as parliament wished, Somerset's last years were clouded with bitterness. His sense of grievance towards King's College (which had already deprived him of the manor of Ruislip) led him to compose a <span class="italic">Queremonia</span>, itemizing his woes in Latin hexameters. Nevertheless, he retained substantial holdings in Middlesex and made generous provision for his elderly mother. He died intestate on 4 June 1454, leaving no children.<br>
