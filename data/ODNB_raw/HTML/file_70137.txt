<span class="headword">Wilson,  Mona</span>  (1872&#150;1954), <span class="occ">civil servant and author</span>, was born in Hillmorton Road, Rugby, on 29 May 1872, the eldest of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36960/', "James Maurice Wilson (1836&#150;1931)")</script>, headmaster and Church of England clergyman, and his first wife, Annie Elizabeth Moore, who died in childbirth in July 1878. Her father subsequently married Georgina Mary Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1926) on 26 March 1883; there were four children of the second marriage. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36944/', "Arnold Talbot Wilson")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36961/', "(James) Steuart Wilson")</script> were her half-brothers. She was educated at Clifton high school and St Leonard's School, St Andrews, before going in 1892 to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she remained until 1896, though she took no examinations. She was made an associate of Newnham in 1932.<br>
<br>Mona Wilson shared her father's interest in the investigation of social and industrial problems, and after she left university she joined the Women's Trade Union League as its secretary in 1899. The league's president was Lady Emilia Dilke, and through her Wilson came to know other young women prominent in the movement for social reform, such as Lucy Streatfeild, May Tennant, Gertrude Tuckwell, and Mary Macarthur&#151;many of whom became state employees. In 1899, under the auspices of the Industrial Law Committee, she compiled a handbook of the legal regulations affecting the working conditions of women employed in factories, workshops, shops, and laundries. It was intended to inform district visitors, deaconesses, mission workers, residents in settlements, helpers in friendly societies and working girls' clubs, and other social workers of what the legal rights of women workers were, so that they could alert the factory inspectorate when the regulations were not complied with.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Wilson began her friendship with the writer Thomas Sturge Moore (1870&#150;1944) and others of his literary and artistic circle. Despite her strong sense of public duty, she sometimes described her work in social investigation and administration as uncongenial and was much more attracted by the literary world  (reminiscences of Sturge Moore sent to Marie Sturge Moore, Sturge Moore MSS, 25/126B). She joined the literary theatre club set up by Moore; his description of her to Robert Trevelyan as &#145;the lady with the terrible eyes&#146;  (Legge, 193) was no doubt a reference to her serious and direct gaze. Her obituary noted that &#145;her ethereal beauty might well have provided a model for Sir Edward Burne-Jones&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>In 1902 Wilson took part in an investigation of social conditions in West Ham, and in 1904, with Miss Mary L. Walker, she directed an inquiry into housing, income, and employment in Dundee&#151;described as one of the most exhaustive ever undertaken. The work also took its toll on her. She described Dundee as &#145;the most depressing place you can possibly imagine&#146;, and although she hoped that her inquiry might do something to eliminate some of the worst social ills, she concluded, &#145;things here are altogether past praying for&#146; and expressed a wider disillusion  (20 Aug 1904, Sturge Moore MSS, 32/85). Later in 1904 she spent some time in Edinburgh to get away from Dundee, and wrote to Mrs Moore that although her work was interesting, &#145;the absolute lack of variety&#151;of friends and pictures and of superfluous brains to read with&#151;make the time pass so slowly &hellip;&#146;  (letter to Marie Sturge Moore, 6 Nov 1904, Sturge Moore MSS, 32/87). When the Dundee inquiry was completed, she made plans for a visit to France to &#145;do something cheerful before I settle down to a new job or I shall become as dull as a Blue Book&#146;. She sent the Moores a copy of her report with apologies for its dullness, noting that journalism was easier to write and read, but that &#145;colourless fact&#146; was needed to &#145;back up certain reforms&#146;  (letter to Marie Sturge Moore, 4 June 1905, Sturge Moore MSS, 32/90).<br>
<br>Wilson drew on that experience in her only traced novel, <span class="italic">The Story of Rosalind Retold from her Diary</span> (1910), a short account of a talented writer and artist who took up &#145;studying social problems in the slums&#146; when her father died, and who died young and tragically. She wrote the book under the pseudonym Monica Moore, presumably as a tribute to Moore. The novel's male narrator reflects Wilson's ambivalence about the work of social reform, describing it as work for which he had &#145;little liking&#146; and &#145;less knowledge &hellip; To me it seemed a terrible waste of her gracious beauty and unusual gifts&#146;  (p. 2).<br>
<br>Wilson was subject to bouts of ill health, and her correspondence during the early years of the twentieth century refers to escapes&#151;often to Ireland&#151;from the work of social inquiry. During one such interlude, riding and hunting in co. Wicklow, she set out her views on women's suffrage and expressed her reservations about women's voluntary social work: she had<blockquote>always found the ordinary middle class woman the worst enemy of the questions I care about which does not induce me to be particularly anxious that she should have a vote. I cannot bring myself to be a &#145;womaniser&#146; and work for &#145;women's revolution&#146; etc. as it seems to entail a belief that women are better than men&#151;whereas I think that only a handful of either sex is very conspicuous for brains and virtue combined, and have a suspicion that the hand containing the men would be distinctly the largest. (letter to Marie Sturge Moore, 15 March 1908, Sturge Moore MSS, 32/94)</blockquote>In November 1911 Wilson was appointed to the National Insurance Commission. She received the same salary&#151;&pound;1000 a year&#151;as her male colleagues, becoming the highest-paid woman civil servant and one of the first to receive equal pay. In 1917 she was seconded to the secretariat of the newly formed Ministry of Reconstruction, where she was the first woman assistant secretary. She acted as secretary to various committees at the ministry and had some responsibility for co-ordinating the voluntary and professional sectors of women's social work during and just after the First World War. She also played a part in the preliminary investigations into setting up a ministry of health. As one of the most senior women civil servants, she found that her views on policy issues affecting women carried some weight. In a record of a meeting with her friend Margaret Llewelyn Davies, the general secretary of the Women's Co-operative Guild, she set out her reservations about the scheme of mother's allowances proposed by the guild during discussions on the <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span>, noting that Miss Davies:<blockquote>seemed inclined to the view, which has apparently been taken by Miss Eleanor Rathbone &hellip; that the father should be relieved by the State of all responsibility for the upkeep of his wife and family &hellip; She advocated the individual wage for the father, and was not prepared to agree that this might be taken as a direct encouragement to polygamy, or that the introduction of such a measure after the War would tend to keep down wages. (memorandum to Vaughan Nash, 19 Nov 1917, TNA: PRO, MH78/80)</blockquote>In the light of criticism from Miss Wilson and Michael Heseltine, also an assistant secretary at the ministry, the Women's Co-operative Guild amended its proposals on the bill.<br>
<br>Given the tone of her letters to the Sturge Moores, it is unlikely that Wilson regretted her retirement from the civil service in 1919. The optimism with which the Ministry of Reconstruction had been set up in 1917 was quickly followed by disappointment and disillusion. In 1919 the ministry was combined with the Ministry of National Service, amalgamated with the Board of Trade, and abolished. Its programmes for wide and enlightened social reform were restricted or ignored by departments more concerned with economy. Her own job disappeared; it had been decided in 1918 that it was &#145;not desirable to continue the appointment of a woman Assistant Secretary&#146;  (memo from Eustace Davies to Vaughan Nash, 15 March 1918, TNA: PRO, RECO1/201).<br>
<br>Wilson moved to Wiltshire, where she lived with her close friend, the writer and historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37076/', "George Malcolm Young (1882&#150;1959)")</script>, with whom she had worked at the Ministry of Reconstruction. She was made a JP and served as a member of the Industrial Fatigue Research Board (1919&#150;29), but devoted most of her time to a prolific literary career. She wrote a series of biographies and biographical studies and often contributed to several literary journals&#151;especially <span class="italic">English</span>, for which she wrote many reviews. She wrote a chapter, &#145;Travel and holidays&#146;, in <span class="italic">Early Victorian England</span> (1934), edited by Young.<br>
<br>Wilson's account of the life and work of William Blake (first published in 1927) remained popular for several decades and was reprinted several times. Her work on less well-known eighteenth-century women writers, <span class="italic">These were Muses</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Jane Austen and some Contemporaries</span> (1938), betrays her preference for a more subtle advocacy of women's claims for equal consideration. In the latter, she referred to her conviction that Austen's name &#145;should be linked with that of the great Vindicator of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft, and that the <i>vis comica</i> of the one has been as powerful an agency in their vindication as the <i>saeva indignatio</i> of the other&#146;  (p. ix). In her contribution to <span class="italic">From Anne to Victoria: Essays by Various Hands</span>, edited by Bonamy Dobr&eacute;e (1937), she noted that Austen was &#145;the most effective exponent&#146; of Wollstonecraft's &#145;main thesis&#146;  (p. 572). Her biography <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth</span> (1932) shows an understanding of the problems faced by women who hold positions of power as well as those of a monarch who was the head of her own civil service.<br>
<br>Towards the end of her life, Mona Wilson suffered from eye problems and hyperthyroidism, but her letters suggest that she was more concerned about Young's health than about her own. Several letters refuse invitations because &#145;Mr. Young&#146; was too ill to travel far. In the event, she died at 99 Howards Lane, Putney, London, on 26 October 1954, four years before him. She was always circumspect in describing their relationship&#151;as was he (his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entries gave his address only as his club), although she clearly felt deep affection and respect for him and set great store by his judgement. A pointed comment on the fact that the Blakes had no children implies her views on the discussion of the private lives of writers and artists: she observed that &#145;speculation as to the influence of this deprivation may be left to those who deem it worth their pains&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life of William Blake</span>, 1971, 20).<br>
<br>Mona Wilson belonged to a generation of civil servants who shaped much of twentieth-century social policy, and to a group of women who powerfully influenced the civil service careers of their successors. She was a successful writer, whose work&#151;especially on eighteenth-century women&#151;deserves to be better known. On the surface, her writing has the calm detachment of the historical observer; as one reviewer noted, she &#145;narrated all the facts [with] thorough but lightly borne knowledge&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, review of <span class="italic">Sir Philip Sidney</span>, 19 May 1931). However, some of her choices of subject&#151;and, in particular, her sensitive discussion of Blake and Sidney&#151;suggest that the passion that lay behind her quiet but clear style was not only for historical truth.<br>
