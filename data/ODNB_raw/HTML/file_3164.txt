<span class="headword">Bradberry,  David</span>  (1735&#150;1803), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born at Reeth, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, on 12 November 1735; nothing is known of his parents. He was a convert of George Whitfield, and in 1759 he began a course of ministerial training at Mile End Academy, Middlesex, but he terminated his course prematurely in February 1762 in order to take up an appointment as assistant to the Revd John Sayers at Alnwick, Northumberland. He remained there until 1764, when he moved to Wellingborough as minister at Cheese Lane Independent Chapel. He appears to have resigned from this post in the summer of 1767, when he moved to Kent as a supply preacher. After preaching to the congregation at the Ebenezer Chapel in Ramsgate on 10 October 1767 he was invited to become its pastor but, while agreeing to preach there on a regular basis, he did not accept pastoral responsibility until April 1769 and was not ordained until 24 October 1770. He continued at Ramsgate with considerable success for eighteen years.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1785 Bradberry accepted the invitation to become minister at Cannon Street Chapel, Manchester. There he soon incensed some of the members of the congregation, and especially the Scottish members, by his attempts to remove the ruling elders from office and to break up the semi-Presbyterian form of church government. This dispute led in 1788 to a considerable secession of members from the church and to the establishment by the seceders of Mosley Street Chapel. Bradberry resigned from Cannon Street, probably in 1795, and for a time was minister at Grovers' Hall, London. His final ministerial appointment was in 1797 at Kennington, Surrey.<br>
<br>Bradberry was not a prolific writer and is credited with just three published works, of which the only one of any note is a poem entitled <span class="italic">Tetelestai: the Final Close</span> (1794). He died in London on 13 January 1803 and was buried in Bunhill Fields. His funeral oration was given by the Revd John Humphries of Dead Man's Place, Southwark, and his funeral sermon was preached by Robert Simpson of Hoxton.<br>
