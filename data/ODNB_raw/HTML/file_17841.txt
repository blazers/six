<span class="headword">Maittaire,  Michael</span>  (1668&#150;1747), <span class="occ">classical scholar and typographer</span>, was born in Rouen on 29 November 1668, the son of French protestant parents of whom nothing further is known. He took refuge in England a few years before the revocation of the edict of Nantes in October 1685, and was educated at Westminster School, &#145;where Dr. Busby well grounded him in the Greek and Latin languages, keeping him some years longer than usual&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.556). He was a king's scholar there in 1682 and matriculated from Oxford University on 16 October 1688, aged nearly twenty; having been made a canoneer student of Christ Church in 1693 he graduated BA in 1694, MA on 23 March 1697, and was incorporated at Cambridge University in 1708. From 1695 to 1699 he was under-master of Westminster School, but left to keep a private boarding-school at Mile End. According to Thomas Hearne &#145;he was turned out of the Schools purely out of Malice, to make way for Mr. Rob. Friend, now D. Div. &amp; Head Master&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 5.232), although others represent his leaving Westminster as a voluntary retirement &#145;consecrated to Learning&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.557). Certainly from the early 1700s he devoted himself to scholarship and began to publish extensively, nearly seventy individual works being attributed to him, mostly in the fields of classics and typography. He lived for much of his life at various residences in London&#151;in the late 1720s in Orange Street, Holborn, and at the time of his death at King Street, near Bloomsbury Square.<br>
<br>Contemporary opinion, both of Maittaire the man and of his scholarly achievement, was somewhat divided. On the one hand he was respected for his probity and strength of conscience, particularly in religious matters. He was a nonjuror and, according to Hearne, a man whom George Hickes had tried unsuccessfully to persuade to take orders. He was also recognized as modest and unassuming, yet convivial, generous, and &#145;fond of friendly intercourse&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 4.564&#150;5). He had a good many friends and acquaintances among the aristocracy, and a number of his extant letters reveal him as a man expert in gaining the favour of patrons both for himself and for others. The earl of Oxford held him in sufficiently high regard to pursue the suppression of several lines in Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> representing Maittaire as an inhabitant of the kingdom of Dullness. The duke of Rutland and Sir Richard Ellis are named in his will as two of his three best friends, to whom he directed his widow for advice and support, and Nichols reports that they each owned a portrait of him. By the standards of the time he was considered a very capable scholar of Latin and more particularly Greek, although his published works were not always highly regarded; while some were considered slapdash others were rated pedestrian and pedantic. Yet his <span class="italic">Graecae linguae dialecti</span> (1706) was still being reissued in 1742 and an abridged version appeared in 1831, while a number of his editions of classical authors were being reprinted in the late eighteenth century, and in a few cases into the nineteenth. Dr Johnson's opinion of Maittaire's work, as reported by James Boswell, was the harshest eighteenth-century view: &#145;he seems to have been a puzzle-headed man, with a large share of scholarship, but with little geometry or logick in his head, without method, and possessed of little genius&#146;  (Boswell, 4.2).<br>
<br>Among his many publications Maittaire's principal contributions to scholarship were in the fields of classical studies and typography. Between 1713 and 1719 he produced several volumes of Latin classics in a series published by Jacob Tonson and John Watts, and various other editions of Greek and Latin authors, in addition to his work on Greek dialects already mentioned. <span class="italic">Annales typographici</span> (5 vols., 1719&#150;41), his history of typography from its beginnings until the year 1664, is a major work of great industry. The first three volumes were published at The Hague, the fourth and fifth at Amsterdam and London respectively. Two supplementary volumes by Michael Denis were added in 1789 and a modern reprint was published at Graz in 1965&#150;7. Maittaire wrote a useful grammar of the English language (1712; repr., 1967), edited the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (1714), and published a new edition of the <span class="italic">Marmora Oxoniensia</span> in 1732, a work that Thomas Hearne, who had wanted to do it himself, considered beyond Maittaire's capabilities: &#145;A Grammarian he may be, but he is far from being an Antiquary, and hath not (I fear) those qualifications that are necessary for an Editor of Greek &amp; Roman Inscriptions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 10.13). Other publications included his <span class="italic">Stephanorum historia</span> (1709) and (with others) a catalogue of the Harleian library (1743&#150;5), several religious essays, and some Latin poetry. His final publication was his <span class="italic">Senilia</span> (1742), a collection of verses on various topics and persons in which, Dr Johnson opined (according to Boswell), &#145;he shows so little learning or taste in his writing, as to make Carteret a dactyl&#146;  (Boswell, 4.2).<br>
<br>In keeping with his classical, bibliographical, and typographical interests Maittaire was a great collector of books. Over about fifty years he had built up a very large library, which included rare early editions of classical authors printed by the major early printing houses of Europe. After his death, on 7 September 1747, his library was sold at auction by Cock and Langford, the sale beginning on 21 November 1748 and lasting forty-four evenings. The sale catalogue was printed from Maittaire's own manuscript catalogue, and a copy with the prices inscribed is in the British Library. He was survived by his wife, Mary.<br>
