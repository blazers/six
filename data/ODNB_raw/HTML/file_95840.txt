<span class="headword">Ahm,  Povl Borge</span>  (1926&#150;2005), <span class="occ">civil and structural engineer</span>, was born in Aarhus, Denmark, on 26 September 1926. He was educated at the Polyteknisk Laereanstalt in Copenhagen, graduating in 1949. He came to England in 1952 to join the consulting engineers Ove Arup &amp; Partners, which had been established by a fellow Dane, Ove Arup, six years earlier. He remained with that firm for the whole of his working life, becoming a partner in 1965, a director in 1977, and chairman in 1989.<br>
<br>The year before Ahm joined Arups the firm had been appointed to work with Basil Spence on the new Coventry Cathedral. Spence's winning competition design had been developed without engineering advice, so Ahm and Ove Arup were called upon to devise a structure that would preserve the integrity of his initial concept. The solution was to provide a vaulted ceiling to the nave, consisting of a network of diagonal beams infilled with slatted timbers, carried on slender cruciform columns. The ceiling and columns, which narrow towards the east end of the cathedral, are separate from the roof above, which spans between the outer walls. Other aspects of the cathedral, such as the roof over the baptistry and the main porch, express their structure more explicitly.<br>
<br>Coventry Cathedral was not consecrated until 1962, by which time Ahm had worked on many other projects. Again with Spence he helped design the first buildings for the University of Sussex and also the British embassy in Rome. With his fellow Dane Arne Jacobsen he worked on St Catherine's College, Oxford (1959&#150;64), producing a geometry of reinforced concrete walls and beams that matches the formality of the college layout. At Smithfield market in London he answered the need for a new column-free market hall by creating a domed concrete shell roof, rising 30 feet from its corners to the centre and mostly only 3 inches thick. Completed in 1963, it was one of the most daring shell structures of its time.<br>
<br>Ahm married Birgit Moller, whom he had known since childhood, in 1953; they had two sons, Carsten and Peter. In 1962 he and his wife built their own house at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, designed with the help of yet another Dane, J&oslash;rn Utzon. It was largely single storey beneath a sloping copper roof, linked to the garden by terraces. Listed grade II by English Heritage, it was described by one critic as &#145;probably the best modern house in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>). At the time of its construction, work on Utzon's masterpiece, the Sydney Opera House, was progressing and Ahm was one of the Arup team working on its engineering aspects.<br>
<br>The collective ethos of the Arup firm discouraged singling out the contribution of individual engineers on a project like the Sydney Opera House. However, Ahm had particular responsibility for the design of the podium on which the building stands, and for the spectacular beams of the concourse roof. The principal sail-like roofs for which the building is famous were first thought of as concrete shells: when eventually it was conceded that a simpler geometry, based on segments of a sphere built from concrete ribs, was the only sensible solution, this owed much to Ahm's work on the concourse beams. Utzon's resignation from the project in 1966 reflected the immense challenges it had posed, in politics and finance as much as design. Ahm was one of those who tried to persuade him to return.<br>
<br>As an engineer Ahm was known to be a brilliant analyst, but even more a designer eager to explore alternative solutions and to experiment. &#145;Engineering&#146;, he said, &#145;is really an art, and unless an engineer is able to use his knowledge and expertise in an imaginative and creative way, the whole discipline is not of much use&#146;  (<span class="italic">Concrete</span>, Jan 1970, 23). As he rose through the Arup hierarchy Ahm had to take on more administrative responsibility. When another famous cultural icon, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, came the firm's way in 1971 it was members of his team (Edmund Happold, Lennart Grut, and Peter Rice) who led on the design, while he kept an overview on the whole operation. During the same years he helped steer the firm towards bridge design and transport projects, particularly after winning the competition to design the Gateshead viaduct in 1965. His responsibilities extended beyond the firm: he was, for instance, a member of the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1972&#150;5 and 1983&#150;6) and chairman of the Association of Consulting Engineers (1992&#150;6). He was made a CBE in 1993 and the same year received the first gold medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He received an honorary degree from Warwick University in 1994.<br>
<br>Ahm was tall, energetic, and self-assured. Among engineers, who are not naturally rhetorical, he stood out as someone who made his presence felt. He enjoyed team sports, and played football for Corinthian Casuals, taking part in the 1956 amateur cup final at Wembley Stadium. He remained with Arups until his retirement in 1992. He died at his home, 44 West Common Way, Harpenden, on 15 May 2005, of cancer of the oesophagus. He was survived by his wife, Birgit, and their two sons.<br>
