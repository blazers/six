<span class="headword">Davidson,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1756&#150;1797), <span class="occ">privateer</span>, was born in Scotland; further details of his family and upbringing are unknown. In 1791 he was serving as an able seaman on the <i>Niger</i>, then commanded by Sir Richard Keats. Davidson was noted as a comparatively well-educated man of gloomy and silent disposition, but liable to sudden outbursts of temper. While the ship was at Deal he was condemned to be flogged for drunkenness and insolence to his superior officer. The punishment caused him excessive agony, and at the fifth stroke he fell into convulsions. The sentence was then remitted, but he later struck an officer and was again condemned. While being brought to the gangway he attempted to cut his throat and, this failing, he tried in vain to throw himself overboard. His punishment was not proceeded with, but he was ordered into confinement.<br>
<br>The whole circumstances of the case led to an inquiry into Davidson's past life, which gave rise to a rumour that he possessed a journal (as yet not authenticated) giving an account of singular atrocities in which he had been engaged. Davidson's chest was ransacked, and the journal was found, and laid before the officers. It claimed that on 1 December 1788 Davidson had enlisted on the <i>Saint Dinnan</i>, a Russian privateer, which on 3 December had sailed from Leghorn for Messina. He and the other Englishmen on the ship were discharged at Trieste on 6 September 1789 with wages and prize money amounting to &pound;230 per man. During the period at sea the <i>Saint Dinnan</i> cruised in the Levant, took a large number of Turkish ships, robbed them, murdered the crews, and burnt the vessels. The privateers also attacked and plundered some of the smaller Grecian islands. On one occasion they had a terrible combat with another pirate, whose crew of over 300 was brutally murdered on capture. These and other horrors Davidson, if the genuine author, narrated in plain methodical order.<br>
<br>&#145;The Bloody journal&#146;, as it was called, came to have considerable renown with sailors, among whom it was probably current in manuscript versions. A copy was procured for Sir Walter Scott, who had heard of it, and thought it might form a good subject for a poem. &#145;On perusal he pronounced it too horrible for versification&#146; but later he printed it in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Annual Register</span> (published in 1812, vol. 3, part 2). Copies of the work, of which the full title is <span class="italic">The Bloody Journal Kept by William Davidson on Board a Russian Pirate in the Year 1789</span>, exist in the library of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and the library of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. The book is full of errors of composition. Whatever its true provenance, Davidson probably found his position on the <i>Niger</i> very uncomfortable. He deserted from her at Portsmouth some time in 1793, was afterwards pressed on the <i>Royal George</i>, where he became a gunners' mate, and was accidentally drowned in January 1797.<br>
