<span class="headword">Turner,  Edward</span>  (1901&#150;1973), <span class="occ">motorcycle designer and manufacturer</span>, was born on 24 January 1901 at 32 Bronti Place, Walworth, Surrey, one of seven surviving children of William Turner, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hillman. Edward Turner gained an early familiarity with metal working and tool making in his father's light engineering works. After some time at the Marconi School and a spell as wireless operator in the merchant navy during the First World War, he opened his own motorcycle shop in Peckham Road, Dulwich. In 1927 he designed and made his own 350 cc motorcycle, the Turner Special. While trying to find someone to manufacture this model, he met John Young (Jack) Sangster, the managing director of the Ariel Cycle Company, and was persuaded to become chief development engineer at the Ariel works in Birmingham in 1927. Turner spent the rest of his working life with Ariel, Triumph, and BSA, and, in collaboration with Val Page and Herbert (Bert) Hopwood, his senior and junior colleagues respectively, was responsible for the creation of many of the principal motorcycle models produced in Britain up to the 1960s.<br>
<br>Turner became chief designer at Ariel in 1932. He designed the four-cylinder Square Four power unit, which sold well from 1932 to 1959 and was scaled up to 500 and 1000 cc. In 1936 he moved to Triumph in Coventry after it was purchased by Sangster. There, in 1937, he designed the Speed Twin that &#145;changed the whole concept of motor cycle design &hellip; A determined and ambitious man who had no time for fools, he was to bring a kind of engineering dictatorship to Triumph &hellip; Above all, Edward Turner had a flair for styling&#146;  (Louis and Currie, 114). He rationalized the eighteen existing models and generated new ideas that earned good profits. He was also an enthusiastic rider.<br>
<br>These were Turner's best years. He became a substantial shareholder in Triumph. Then, in July 1939, his first wife, Edith Marion, was killed in a car accident. He took the loss hard. A therapeutic visit to the United States was the first of many. He was also badly affected by the bombing of Coventry, which destroyed the Triumph factory in 1940, and he may also have begun to suffer from the diabetes that later affected him. It is said that, thereafter, he became a different man, less dynamic, more cantankerous. He was managing director of Triumph from 1944 to 1956 and of the motorcycle division at BSA from September 1956, under Sangster's chairmanship, until January 1964; he remained on the board until 1967. Although in charge at Small Heath, Birmingham, he preferred Triumph's Meriden factory, but did nothing to eliminate tension between the two works and their staff and styles. Triumph with its annual output of 5000 machines was much smaller than Small Heath, where 50,000 motorcycles and other products were made in 1951.<br>
<br>Turner's responsibilities in the late 1950s covered Ariel, Triumph, BSA, and Sunbeam, and the Redditch works where scooter engines and small motorcycles were made. He had a brief design interest in luxury cars before Daimler was sold to Jaguar in 1960. In 1955, a Triumph reached 193 m.p.h on the Bonneville track in the USA. Outstanding successes were the BSA Rocket and Triumph Trident Three in the 1960s. At this time, Triumphs in particular were selling well in the USA and the group commanded the British market, though rivalled by Norton in both markets. But there were also failures&#151;no successful scooters, no sharing of components and tools across marques, and no drive for a full-size range to meet Japanese competition arriving in the early 1960s and dominant in all except the largest machines by the end of the 1960s. Suggested plans to combat the threat in these ways were called &#145;potty&#146; or &#145;irrelevant&#146; by Turner  (Hopwood, 193, 197, 201). The bad management that finally broke the group and the British motorcycle industry in 1969 and in the 1970s began under Turner and Sangster. One element was Turner's bad temper and jealous attitude to his designers and engineers. Another was his regular absence from the group in California, where he spent several months each year. Writing in 1981, Bert Hopwood, a senior designer in the group, was sharply critical of Turner, giving evidence of his waywardness. Davies  (86) described his temper as &#145;ferocious&#146;, one designer actually being kicked. Others, including Ryerson, offered a more favourable picture.<br>
<br>Turner became a rich man, living in some style near Kenilworth until moving on his retirement to Rutland Gate in London and later to Capel, a few miles from Dorking in Surrey. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and of the Institute of Directors and a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers. He married for a second time on 19 July 1952. His second wife, Shirley Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watts, from Sydney, was a teenage Australian for whom he seems to have felt an &#145;uncharacteristic tenderness&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>, 5.569). They had three children before divorcing about 1968. Turner died on 15 August 1973, aged seventy-two, at his home, Newlands, Weare Street, Capel.<br>
