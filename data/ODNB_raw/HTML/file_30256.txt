</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  Arthur</span>  (1741&#150;1820), <span class="occ">agricultural reformer and writer</span>, was born at Whitehall in London on 11 September 1741. He was the younger son of Arthur Young (1693&#150;1759), rector of Bradfield Combust, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and chaplain to Arthur Onslow, speaker of the House of Commons. His mother, Anne Lucretia (1706&#150;1785), daughter of John de Cousmaker, brought her husband so large a dowry as to require that the manor and lands of Bradfield Hall, the small estate which the Youngs had owned since 1672, be settled on herself.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>The youngest of three children, Young was sent to a school at Lavenham which his father had attended. The son later described it as &#145;that wretched place&#146; where he failed to receive a good grounding in the classics  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 7). In 1758 he left school and was apprenticed to Messrs Robertson, wine merchants of King's Lynn. It was planned that subsequently he should enter the London merchants firm of Messrs Tomlinson, since his sister, Eliza Maria, had married John Tomlinson. However, her early death in childbirth put an end to the scheme. In later life Young greatly regretted not having gone to university (as his elder brother, John, had done), and since he found trade detestable, thought the &pound;400 paid by his father for his apprenticeship wasted. Nevertheless, as an apprentice Young made the most of life in King's Lynn, patronizing its theatre and assembly rooms and cutting a figure at town balls. He had already begun to collect books while at school, and in his spare time produced his first pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Theatre of the Present War in North America</span>. It was published in 1758 when he was seventeen, and the publisher paid him in books to the value of &pound;10. The pamphlet received favourable comment from the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, but the same journal made severe criticism of his second pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Present State of Affairs at Home and Abroad</span>.<br>
<br>In 1761, having completed his apprenticeship, Young left King's Lynn for London, where he began at his own expense a monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Universal Museum</span>. This he soon abandoned after Samuel Johnson, having declined to write for it, advised him to persuade the booksellers to take it on. Two years later he suffered a haemorrhage of the lung and was sent to the Hotwells, Bristol, to recuperate. There he met Major-General Sir Charles Howard, who offered him a commission in his cavalry regiment, but although Young was willing to accept, the proposal was vetoed by his mother, mainly because of his weak health.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerinagriculture"></a>Early career in agriculture</h2>Young was now twenty-two, and had experience only of trade, which he disliked, and of publishing, in which he had failed. His lack of a university education ruled out the church, and without other prospects he now made the key decision of his life, turning to a career in farming when his mother offered him the tenancy of a farm at Bradfield. He devoted his energies towards gaining a command of agriculture, collecting many books on the subject and reading well-known authors such as Samuel Hartlib, Jethro Tull, H. L. Duhamel du Monceau, and Walter Harte. While farming at Bradfield from 1763 to 1767 Young was again tempted to take up his pen and ventured into his new field with only one year's experience of farming. His letters to the <span class="italic">Museum Rusticum</span> were written between October 1764 and April 1765, and concerned such topics as the importance of making experiments, drainage, and the advantages of touring Europe to observe different methods of cultivation, urging the Society of Arts to support the plan. Through these letters Young became acquainted with the Revd Walter Harte, whose <span class="italic">Essays in Husbandry</span> had been published in 1764. Harte recommended Young to collect his letters and publish them with further additions as a book, and this was the origin of <span class="italic">The farmer's letters to the people of England &hellip; to which are added Sylvae, or, Occasional tracts on husbandry and rural oeconomics</span>. Published in 1767 the book supported the bounty on the export of corn and introduced some of his enduring themes: the cultivation of waste lands, enclosure as a preliminary to improvement, and the superiority of large farms. While at Bradfield Young conducted and kept records of numerous experiments which he later incorporated in his <span class="italic">Elements of Agriculture</span>, a vast work which has never been published.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandfamily"></a>Marriage and family</h2>On 1 July 1765 Young married Martha Allen (1740&#150;1815), daughter of a wealthy King's Lynn family. They had four children: Mary (<i>b</i>. 1766), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1767), Arthur (<i>b</i>. 1769), and Martha Anne (<i>b</i>. 1783)&#151;Young's favourite, dubbed Bobbin&#151;but only Mary and Arthur outlived their parents. Young's marriage was happy for the first two years but subsequently his wife came to oppose his all-absorbing interest in agriculture. She accompanied him, however, on his northern tour of 1768 and joined him during his stay in Ireland in 1778. No doubt Young's frequent absences from home, his flirtations, and his expenditure on agricultural tours and experiments contributed to her hostility. She appears to have suffered mental deterioration and her surviving letters reveal confusion of mind and, at one time, an almost pathological dislike of Bradfield. Visitors described violent disputes and quarrels, and how Young treated her overbearing temper with &#145;calm, easy contempt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Early Diary of Frances Burney</span>, 1.114&#150;15). According to a French visitor, Fran&ccedil;ois de la Rochefoucauld, who was at Bradfield in 1784, Mrs Young was &#145;hideously swarthy&#146; and looked &#145;exactly like a devil&#146;, tormenting her children and servants and showing ill temper towards visitors  (Marchand, 38). Young himself made quite a different impression as extremely good-humoured and never out of spirits, eager to show off his farm and its implements and to share his ideas. Martha Young died in 1815, and Young paid an extraordinary tribute to her memory in a plaque placed in Bradfield church, describing her only as &#145;the great-granddaughter of John Allen, esq., of Lyng House in the county of Norfolk, the first person, according to the Comte de Boulainvilliers, who there used marl&#146;.<h2>
<a name="FarmingandwritinginHertfordshire"></a>Farming and writing in Hertfordshire</h2>Late in 1767 Young and his family left Bradfield owing to friction between his wife and his mother. He advertised in the newspapers for a farm, and the journeys of inspection he made at this time formed the basis of his slim volume <span class="italic">A Six Weeks' Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales</span> (1768). He first took Sampford Hall, a farm of 300 acres in north-western Essex, but was obliged to relinquish it immediately when a relation failed to advance a loan for stocking it. He settled in 1768 at Bradmore Farm, North Mymms, near Hatfield in Hertfordshire. His farming failure there he ascribed to its terrible soil of &#145;vitriolic gravel&#146;, which he mistook on seeing it in an unusually favourable season, but his continuing financial problems also resulted from his spending money on experiments, and his frequent absences for long periods. He thought of emigrating to America but his wife opposed the idea. Instead, he resorted to his pen and based two of his most important books on tours made at this time, one to the northern counties of England, and the other to the eastern counties. In 1773 he took advantage of his proximity to London to become a parliamentary reporter for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, which meant spending most of the week in London and walking home to his farm at weekends. His pamphlet <span class="italic">A Letter to Lord Clive</span>, advising his lordship to invest his Indian fortune in becoming an improving landlord, appeared in 1767 and was followed, among lesser works, by <span class="italic">A Six Months' Tour through the North of England</span> (4 vols., 1769), <span class="italic">The Farmer's Guide in Hiring and Stocking Farms</span> (2 vols., 1770), <span class="italic">Rural Economy, or, Essays on the Practical Parts of Husbandry</span> (2 vols., 1770), <span class="italic">A Course of Experimental Agriculture</span> (2 vols., 1770), <span class="italic">The Farmer's Tour through the East of England</span> (4 vols., 1771), <span class="italic">The Farmer's Kalendar</span> (1771; this book went through ten editions in Young's lifetime), <span class="italic">Observations on the Present State of the Waste Lands of Great Britain</span> (1773), and <span class="italic">Political arithmetic. Containing observations on the present state of Great Britain and the principles of her policy in the encouragement of agriculture</span> (1774). The <span class="italic">Course of Experimental Agriculture</span> Young later thought to be immature and unsound, and he bought up and destroyed all the copies he could lay hands on.<br>
<br>The northern and eastern tours, each covering great areas of the country, have proved valuable historical sources down to the present. Young's procedure was to announce his journey in advance in the newspapers and so meet improving landlords and leading farmers along his route, with the result that much of his material concerned the ideas and experiments they were making. In the middle 1770s Young was also active in the Society of Arts, which in 1765 and 1766 had awarded him prizes for cultivating madder. In 1769 he also won two gold medals for his papers on hogs and coleseed, and in 1773 he was elected chairman of the society's committee on agriculture. Young was also elected FRS.<br>
<br>While at North Mymms, Young made lifelong friends among the family of Charles Burney, the musician, whom he had first met at King's Lynn. As a widower, Burney had in 1767 married as his second wife Young's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Allen, the widow of Stephen Allen, a King's Lynn merchant. Fanny, one of Burney's daughters, was in later years a frequent visitor to Bradfield and her diary recorded many glimpses of Young's life there. Elizabeth Allen's daughter from her first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18509/', "Elizabeth Meeke")</script>, also became a successful, and prolific, author.<h2>
<a name="VisittoIreland"></a>Visit to Ireland</h2>By 1776 Young felt he needed a new field of interest, and he decided on a visit to Ireland, a project he had been thinking of for some time. Armed with letters of introduction, he travelled widely, returning home in October of that year &#145;without a shilling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 81&#150;2). However, by the following summer he was able to return in the capacity of resident agent to Lord Kingsborough, with responsibility for supervising a huge estate at Michelstown to the north of Cork. He now gave up Bradmore Farm, but his new career proved to be short-lived. He was at Michelstown for only a year, although in that time he set on foot ambitious improvements to the estate. The cause of his leaving the post so quickly is obscure, but he returned to Bradfield on 1 January 1779 to work on his <span class="italic">A Tour in Ireland</span> with an annuity of &pound;72 a year in lieu of his arrears of salary. The book appeared in 1780, was well received at the time, and has since become a valuable source as one of the few accounts of conditions in Ireland at this time. Among other subjects Young had much to say on commercial policy and the activities of the Dublin Society; and in addition Young attacked the practice of subletting land to middlemen and made some interesting observations on the living conditions of the poor.<h2>
<a name="LifeatBradfield"></a>Life at Bradfield</h2>Farming again at Bradfield, Young was now famous as an agricultural expert in Britain and Europe but his financial situation was little better than before he went to Ireland and he thought again of going to America. However, he settled at Bradfield as the occupier of his mother's home farm and entered into the life of a gentleman farmer, spending each winter in London, when he met his friends and attended parliament, the Royal Society, Society of Arts, and the opera. After his great flurry of books in 1769&#150;74, the nine years from 1775 to 1783 were, for him, remarkably unproductive, seeing only the <span class="italic">Tour in Ireland</span> and a pamphlet on building ships for the Royal Navy. Young's financial position improved substantially in the course of the 1780s. An aunt who died in 1782 left him her house, two farms, a horse and carriage, and an annuity of about &pound;150. The aunt indicated that the annuity would have been greater had she not been offended by Young's wife. The death of his mother in 1785 and of his brother in the following year brought him the ownership of the whole Bradfield estate. His brother, the Revd John Young, was thirteen years older than Arthur Young, and was a fellow at Eton College, chaplain to the king, and prebendary of Worcester. He suffered a broken neck in a fall while hunting on a new horse with the king.<br>
<br>Now well established as master of Bradfield, Young further indulged his taste for agricultural experiments, some of them of a bizarre character. After seeking advice from Joseph Priestley, he attempted to ascertain the value of &#145;phlogiston&#146; as a food of plants, tried the effects of expelling air from the soil, and attempted to discover whether electricity affected plants. It seems very likely that Young devoted so much of his energy to his experiments, his correspondence, and to making tours and visiting friends, that he had little time to spare for the proper supervision of his farm. This is the impression left by the accounts of distinguished visitors who were drawn by his name to see his farming. While at North Mymms his visitors included Lord Darlington and Prince Massalsky, bishop of Vilna, who inspected his 8 acres of experimental crops, his newly introduced Suffolk swing-plough, and his collection of implements. The celebrated Northumberland breeder George Culley came to Bradfield in 1784 but in his disappointment concluded that &#145;people that devote their time to writing cannot act or execute; his sheep are scabbed, his cattle ill chose and worse managed, in short he exhibits a sad picture of mismanagement&#146;  (Culley MSS, ZCU 1, 18, 44). Disappointment was also expressed in the comments of other expert visitors, for example, John Boys, a large farmer from east Kent, who was at Bradfield in 1793 and was there again the following year in company with John Ellman, the pioneer breeder of the new Southdown sheep. Nevertheless, Boys found much to interest him. He took particular note of Young's novel practice of stall-feeding cattle on chicory, and his great collection of ploughing implements. He noted also Young's cultivated grasses and his sheep, which included the Spanish Merino ram presented to Young in admiration by the king, and his cross-breeding experiments with Southdowns, Norfolks, and Bakewell's New Leicesters. On the second visit to Bradfield, wrote Boys, they joined such a gathering as &#145;was perhaps never before collected from so great a distance, most of the party coming more than a hundred miles, and one gentleman, Mr Colhoun, to wait upon Mr Young has travelled 170 miles&#146;. The party walked round Young's farm before dinner, and observed his Dishley rams and the &#145;collection of grasses in his experiment ground&#146;. They saw how Young used only a single pair of oxen, driven by one man, to turn a stiff soil, for which a Sussex or Weald of Kent farmer would have required at least eight oxen, with perhaps a horse or two and two drivers, &#145;and not plough much more, in a given time, than Mr Young does with his man and a pair of oxen&#146;  (Young, <span class="italic">Annals of Agriculture</span>, 19.89&#150;93; 21.75&#150;7).<br>
<br>It appears that Young's more rational experiments were of considerable value, and this is borne out by the requests for seed and implements that he received from correspondents. By the 1780s Young's reputation had so grown that numbers of visitors, experts, and students were drawn to Bradfield from all over Europe. He was elected to numerous learned societies at home and abroad. So encouraged, in 1784 he launched his new periodical, <span class="italic">Annals of Agriculture</span>, a project which he had had in view for some years. It was intended, among other things, to put before the public the views and experience of the foremost agriculturists, but Young was bitterly disappointed in its sales. Although he managed to keep it going for thirty-two years until 1815 and included many of his own tours in it, he was constantly frustrated that it did not achieve a larger circulation than a few hundred copies. An immense amount of labour was involved in editing so large a periodical work and Young was fortunate in being able to call on the assistance of his friend the Revd John Symonds, professor of modern history at Cambridge and a keen experimental farmer, who lived close to Bury St Edmunds and thus within a few miles of Bradfield. Both Symonds and Young were involved in local society, becoming friends of the duke of Grafton, whose mansion at Euston lay to the north of Bury, while at Ickworth, a few miles to the south of the town, a select group of intellectuals, including Young and Symonds, dined regularly with Frederick Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol and bishop of Derry.<br>
<br>Young was an advocate of vocational forms of education, especially for the sons of landowners. He warmly supported the University of Edinburgh's proposal in 1789 to endow a chair of agriculture, asking: &#145;Why not a Professor of Agriculture in every University?&#146;  (Young, <span class="italic">Annals of Agriculture</span>, 11.367&#150;8). Holding that a proper understanding of farming could be gained only by practical application, he believed that a gentleman's son should not go to university but be placed with a substantial farmer for a period of ten years&#151;a shorter span would hardly be sufficient to learn the business properly. However, Young's own son went up to Cambridge in 1789 and was supported there for four years at a cost of &pound;100 a year. Against Young's wishes he took holy orders, but he also showed marked agricultural interests, writing the two reports on Sussex for the board of agriculture, published in 1793 and 1808, and deputizing for his father in making a very prolonged agricultural survey in Russia from 1805 to 1814 for Tsar Alexander.<h2>
<a name="TravelsinFranceCataloniaandItaly"></a>Travels in France, Catalonia, and Italy</h2>Between 1787 and 1790 Young made three lengthy visits to France, Catalonia, and northern Italy, which resulted in his very interesting and most historically valuable book, <span class="italic">Travels during the years 1787, 1788 and 1789, undertaken more particularly with a view of ascertaining the cultivation, wealth, resources and national prosperity of the kingdom of France</span>; this work was later generally known as <span class="italic">Travels in France</span>. It was published in 1793 and reprinted in various versions in 1889, 1915, and 1929, and appeared in French in 1931. The first tour, made between May and November 1787, covered a route of 2200 miles in France, together with a long excursion into Catalonia. The second journey, between August and October 1788, was the shortest but still extended to as much as 1200 miles through the western provinces of Normandy, Brittany, and Anjou. The third visit, between June 1789 and January 1790, encompassed about 2100 miles in France besides a lengthy journey through northern Italy. The interest of <span class="italic">Travels in France</span> is enhanced by the accounts of lands that were for the most part strange to Young and unknown to many of his readers. His commentaries, in consequence, were broad in scope, and in addition to farming, described aspects&#151;the scenery, roads, inns, manners, and the signs of wealth or poverty&#151;which in England he would have taken for granted or passed over in a very few words. His visits to France took place in a period which saw the beginnings of the revolution, and this gives his first-hand accounts an importance which is almost as vital now as it was to those who lived through these years. Indeed, historians on both sides of the channel have drawn heavily on Young for his view of France at this critical juncture.<br>
<br>Young's first journey arose from an invitation from his friend Maximilien de Lazowski, whom he had met at Bradfield. Lazowski was tutor to the sons of the duc de Liaincourt, and he asked Young to join Fran&ccedil;ois de la Rochefoucauld and himself on a visit to the spa Bagn&egrave;res de Luchon in the Pyrenees. Proceeding at a leisurely pace of some 30 miles a day, the party left Paris and travelled south via Orl&eacute;ans, Limoges, and Toulouse. Young was all admiration for the roads and he found the inns superior to English ones in food and beds if not in servants: the maids at Souillac, with his usual hyperbole, were &#145;walking dunghills&#146;  (Young, <span class="italic">Travels in France</span>, 1.36&#150;7). The farming was generally backward and he noted some remarkable signs of poverty. While at Bagn&egrave;res, Young and Lazowski embarked on a journey across the Pyrenees into Catalonia. Braving precipitous roads and primitive inns, they were relieved to reach the civilization of Barcelona. Their return northwards was along the coast to Perpignan. There they parted, Young to make a lengthy detour to see on his own the regions of Roussillon and Languedoc. He made his way to Bagn&egrave;res via Montpellier, N&icirc;mes, and Carcassonne, enduring heat, flies, and verminous inns. On the return to Paris, Young travelled separately for part of the way in order to see more of the country, riding through Bayonne, Auch, Bordeaux, Tours, and Blois. He spent some time in Paris, which he found more expensive than London, and he stayed also as a guest at the family estate of the duc de Liaincourt. In Paris he was thrilled to meet A. L. Lavoisier, the celebrated chemist, and a number of other scientists. In discussing politics, Young found his acquaintances much in fear of the near approach of national bankruptcy and of revolutionary changes.<br>
<br>On his second journey in France in 1788 Young went alone and did not revisit Paris. He travelled in simple style on his own horse, with his luggage in a &#145;cloak-bag&#146; slung behind him. Within a week of starting, his mare began to go blind, but he carried on and brought himself and mare safely back to Bradfield after an absence of three months. Staying at an inn the night after Charles James Fox and a female companion had lodged there, he could not help comparing his blind mare with Fox's post-chaise, waiting-woman, valet, and French courier, &#145;but I have been doing all my life and he has been talking&#146;  (BL, Add. MSS 35126, fol. 427). His route took him through Rouen, Le Havre, Caen, and Cherbourg, where he inspected the harbour improvements and visited a glass factory. Crossing Brittany from Rennes to Brest he was appalled by the poverty: Combourg was &#145;one of the most brutal filthy places that can be seen&#146;  (Young, <span class="italic">Travels in France</span>, 1.174). The contrasting luxury of Nantes was associated with such a spirit of liberty as to make him think that &#145;the American Revolution has laid the foundation of another in France, if the government does not take care of itself&#146;  (ibid.). He returned via Angers, Le Mans, and Rouen, with an excursion to La Roche Guyon to visit his friends the duc de la Rochefoucauld and the duchesse d'Anville.<br>
<br>On his third visit to France, Young arrived in Paris in June 1789, and through his friends, the Rochefoucauld&#150;Liaincourt family, he met a number of prominent figures in the rapidly changing political scene including the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans and the Abb&eacute; Siey&egrave;s. He attended meetings of the third estate and purchased quantities of revolutionary pamphlets (which now form one of the treasures of the Goldsmiths' Library of the University of London). Noting the violent tone of the pamphlets and the speeches he heard, he predicted the coming of a civil war and the creation of a republic. However, he did not forget the main purpose of his visit, and setting out in a purchased one-horse cabriolet, he travelled in a new direction, eastwards towards Strasbourg. As before, he discussed farming matters with acquaintances among the landowners and farmers along the way. The striking differences he found in the working people of France and England Young ascribed, as with much else, to bad government. At Strasbourg he heard the news of the fall of the Bastille, which he recognized as opening the way to either a new constitution or &#145;inextricable confusions and civil war&#146;  (Young, <span class="italic">Travels in France</span>, 1.293). He witnessed the sack of the city's h&ocirc;tel de ville and was shocked that the troops did not restore order and even joined in the looting.<br>
<br>The next stage of Young's journey was south-westwards towards Toulon and was made hazardous by peasant uprisings and rumours of outrages and Parisian plots. In one town he found the inhabitants &#145;very menacing&#146;  (Young, <span class="italic">Travels in France</span>, 1.305), but escaped by making an impromptu speech on the steps of his inn, stating that in England it was the nobility rather than the commoners who bore the brunt of taxation. At Dijon his friends made it possible for him to obtain the passport which had become essential to a traveller, but at Thueyts, south of Clermont Ferrand, he was arrested by armed national guards. His enquiries about the farming had led to the suspicion that he was an agent of the aristocracy, sent to double the taxes. At Toulon he sold his horse and cabriolet as he was told that it would not be practicable to take them into Italy. Consequently, he walked to the border with a peasant woman whose ass he hired for his luggage.<br>
<br>Young was in Italy from 16 September to 25 December. He found the inns to be generally better than in France, and living far cheaper; but the roads were much poorer while the horses and carriages offered for hire were frightful. Venice was delightfully cheap and he had his own gondolier, but the journey from Venice to Bologna took five days on a barge, the food was disgusting, and he was packed in at night with a dozen other people in a tiny cabin. However, he enjoyed two weeks in Florence with pleasant company and the hospitality of the ambassador, Lord John Augustus Hervey, as well as finding a greater interest there in scientific agriculture than in other Italian cities. By January 1790 he was back in Paris where he was again engrossed by the revolution. He saw the royal family under the watch of the national guard, and attended the national assembly to hear Mirabeau. He also found time to collect more pamphlets and copy some of the public records.<br>
<br>Young's experiences in France brought about a permanent change in his political views. From being a liberal and a reformer, by 1792 he had become an opponent of the revolution and a conservative in English matters. He was highly critical of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> but, equally, he attacked the excesses of the revolution, and now he was fearful of the consequences of reform in England, necessary though it was. In France he had seen destitute aristocrats sheltering in inns from the destruction of their ch&acirc;teaux, and he now received the dreadful news of the murder of his friend the duc de la Rochefoucauld, while another friend, the duc de Liaincourt, had taken refuge as an <i>emigr&eacute;</i> in Bury St Edmunds. What was perhaps his most influential pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Example of France a Warning to Britain</span>, appeared in 1793 and reflected his changed views.<br>
<br>In the recent past, however, during the intervals between his French visits, Young's former liberalism had been very evident. He took up the anti-slavery cause and wrote several articles on the subject in the <span class="italic">Annals</span>, and he also joined Sir Joseph Banks in leading the opposition to a bill intended to strengthen the prohibition on the export of wool. His journeys in England included visits to leading farmers and breeders and he published a long report on Sussex in the <span class="italic">Annals</span>. In 1790 he was involved in the agitation over a new corn law, and spent the autumn of that year recovering from a serious illness. Subsequently he was in correspondence with George Washington about farming in Pennsylvania and Virginia; the correspondence was later published as <span class="italic">Letters from his Excellency George Washington to Arthur Young</span> (1801). He also made a tour in the midlands, spending several days with Robert Bakewell, the celebrated breeder, followed by a visit to John Ellman.<h2>
<a name="Theboardofagriculture"></a>The board of agriculture</h2>A new stage in Young's career began in 1793 with the establishment, with government support, of the board of agriculture. The idea for such a board had originated with William Marshall, the distinguished agricultural writer, who was a critic of Young. The board, however, was dominated by Young's friends, and aided by his shift to conservative views, he was regarded as the most suitable person to be the board's secretary, an appointment bitterly resented by Marshall. The latter's hostility became even greater when the board decided to commission a series of agricultural reports of individual counties, rather than of regions as Marshall advocated. Subsequently Marshall set out to criticize the reports at length, which he did in his <span class="italic">Review and Abstracts of the Reports to the Board of Agriculture</span> (1818).<br>
<br>The first editions of the county reports appeared between 1793 and 1795, followed by fuller revised versions between 1798 and 1817. The reports were uneven in quality and length but constitute nevertheless an invaluable source for farming practices at the end of the eighteenth century and the period of the Napoleonic wars. No fewer than six of the reports were written by Young himself: Suffolk (1794); Lincolnshire (1799); Hertfordshire (1804); Norfolk (1804); Essex (1807); and Oxfordshire (1809). Young's report on Lincolnshire earned him the enmity of Thomas Stone, a well-known surveyor, who had written the first version in 1794 and felt insulted not to have been asked to write the revised report. Stone had suffered a harsh review by Young of an earlier paper, and he now repaid that attack by publishing a damning review of Young's report.<h2>
<a name="Religiousconversion"></a>Religious conversion</h2>As secretary to the board of agriculture Young now spent most of the year in London, though he still found time not only to write his county reports and produce the <span class="italic">Annals</span> but also to produce further pamphlets, particularly on his proposal for forming a voluntary yeoman cavalry for providing internal defence against a French invasion. He suffered the worst personal blow of his life in 1797 when his favourite daughter, Martha Anne (Bobbin), died from tuberculosis. His second daughter, Elizabeth, had died three years earlier from the same disease, but it was the loss of his youngest daughter that affected him more deeply, especially as he held himself partly to blame for her death. At this time he developed a close friendship with William Wilberforce, and it was under his influence that Young, never previously much interested in religion, experienced a remarkable conversion. From this time until his death, nearly twenty-three years later, his views and interests showed great changes.<br>
<br>In the past Young had not expressed much sympathy with poverty and suffering, although he had been much moved by the distress he saw in France. He now began to do what he could to help the poor of his neighbourhood, and some of his publications were directly concerned with the problem of rural poverty which had recently been intensified by a rapid growth of population and the high food prices of the war period. He investigated the injurious effects that had followed from many of the enclosures of open fields and commons, and he proposed measures to provide the poor with land, a remedy which he believed would restore their independence. His 1801 pamphlet <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Propriety of Applying Wastes to the Maintenance and Support of the Poor</span> made suggestions of this kind, and his 1804 report on Norfolk included a lengthy section dealing with the effects of enclosure in that county. Similar accounts for other counties also appeared in the <span class="italic">Annals</span>. However, his <span class="italic">Report on Enclosures</span>, edited for the board of agriculture in 1808, was primarily a compilation of the statistics of enclosure and a statement of the arguments for and against it. His last important work for the board was the publication in 1816, under the title <span class="italic">Agricultural State of the Kingdom</span>, of a digest of the replies received from landowners and farmers to a circular letter requesting information on the effects of the fall in prices and restriction of bank credit which accompanied the end of the Napoleonic wars.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>In 1808 when he was gathering material in Oxfordshire for his last county report, Young first noticed a deterioration in his eyesight. An operation for cataract in 1811 was unsuccessful and he became completely blind. It was in this year that he first met Marianne Francis, who was related to the Burney family. This exceptionally gifted young lady spent much time at Bradfield and kept up a correspondence with Young when not there. She became almost a granddaughter to the aged agriculturist as well as acting as an additional secretary. In her letters from Bradfield she mentioned his kindness in clothing and educating some thirty or forty poor children from the district, and his Sunday services at the hall, attended by tenants and villagers. Young, she said, had become an enthusiast for the steam engine, which he believed would play a central role in the farming of the future.<br>
<br>Young's last pamphlets, published between 1813 and 1817, concerned the striking changes in agricultural prices which had occurred since the outbreak of the wars, and also dealt with quite different subjects, including selections from the writings of Richard Baxter and Robert Owen. In addition, he still kept up his correspondence with many distinguished figures of the time. Though well into his seventies, he continued to spend long periods in London, continuing his work for the board and visiting friends. He died there on 12 April 1820 at Sackville Street, aged seventy-eight, after a painful illness caused by bladder calculus, and was buried at Bradfield Combust church nine days later.<h2>
<a name="Youngssignificance"></a>Young's significance</h2>Young was not only the best-known agricultural reformer and publicist of his time, with an international reputation, but also a figure of importance in the political and social issues of the day. He had an extraordinary capacity for work, aided by an extremely strong constitution&#151;at Bradfield he rose at five and took an early morning dip in one of the ponds. In an age of hazardous roads he travelled many thousands of miles, a high proportion of them on horseback or on foot, and he still found energy to write up his day's notes and perhaps some letters in his inn room at night. Some modern historians have criticized his agricultural work and have compared him unfavourably with his rival, William Marshall, but it is often overlooked that their approaches were different: Marshall gave an account of the farming of a region as a whole, while Young was not concerned with presenting a rounded picture of contemporary farming; his interests lay entirely in reporting on new advances and condemning old and inefficient methods. His enthusiasm often led him into hyperbole, but he was realistic in appreciating that farmers would only take up what could be shown to pay. Some of his own experiments were misconceived, but in his day the true factors in plant growth were far from understood. As a pioneering scientific spirit he was very widely respected, and his knowledge, wit, and pleasant personality made him welcome in both aristocratic mansion and modest farmhouse.<br>
<br>Although he always believed in the primacy of agriculture, Arthur Young also showed interest in the industrial and transport developments of the time, and his tours gave extensive descriptions, for example, of the Bridgewater Canal and Coalbrookdale ironworks. His range of correspondents was enormously broad, including not only his many friends and acquaintances in Europe, and George Washington and Lafayette, but also Joseph Priestley, William Wilberforce, Sir Humphry Davy, Thomas Malthus, James Boswell, William Pitt (1759&#150;1806), and Edmund Burke, as well as scores of landowners and other agricultural figures. He was a man of wide culture, well read, interested in art, architecture, theatre and music, especially opera. There is no doubt that he wrote too much and too quickly, and sometimes with insufficient knowledge of the topic. Nevertheless, much of what he wrote in his vigorous, earthy style has a permanent value for the understanding of the period, most notably his three early tours in England, his books on Ireland and France, and many of his contributions to the <span class="italic">Annals</span>. This periodical he probably regarded as his greatest achievement. Less tangible, but perhaps not less significant, was the enthusiasm for improved farming that he inspired among uncounted country people whom he met on his travels.<br>
