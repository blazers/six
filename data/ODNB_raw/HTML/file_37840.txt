</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pearse,  Patrick Henry</span>  (1879&#150;1916), <span class="occ">writer and Irish revolutionary</span>, was born on 10 November 1879 at 27 Great Brunswick Street, Dublin, the elder son and second of the four children of James Pearse (1839&#150;1900), stone carver, of London, Birmingham, and Dublin, and his second wife, Margaret (1857&#150;1932), a shop assistant, one of two surviving daughters of Patrick Brady, coal factor, of Dublin.<br>
<br>Always exceptionally imaginative, young Pearse was greatly influenced by his maternal aunt Margaret, who stirred his romantic soul with patriotic ballads of death and exile, tales of mythological Irish heroes, and hagiographical accounts of such doomed revolutionary leaders as Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet. Like many children of his time he fantasized about becoming a hero, but his was a morbid preoccupation with suffering and dying for his country or his religion: his heroes had died painful deaths and his main religious devotion was to the crucified Christ.<br>
<br>Two Christian Brothers at his secondary school in Westland Row, Dublin, helped to spark in Pearse an uncritical passion for the Irish language and its literature: his view of Ireland past, present, and future was always to have mystical overtones. To him, the reputed feats of mythological heroes were real, and the dead whom he admired had mythological status.<br>
<br>At sixteen Pearse joined the Gaelic League, and henceforward took every opportunity to improve both his public speaking and his writing, in both English and Irish; before he was twenty he had published <span class="italic">Three Lectures on Gaelic Topics</span>. Able and industrious rather than brilliant, in 1901 he took a good second-class BA from University College, Dublin, in English, French, and Irish, won an exhibition, and was called to the bar, having studied for a BL at Trinity College, Dublin, and the King's Inns.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1900 Pearse became head of his family, and with his brother, Willie&#151;an artist and sculptor of slight talent&#151;he tried and failed to keep the family firm prosperous until its final dissolution in 1910. None of the siblings married; Pearse himself seems to have been unconsciously homosexual. His mother, Willie, and his two sisters were all emotionally dependent on him, for though he was reserved and socially uneasy&#151;especially with women&#151;he had a strong personality and his passion for his causes was inspiring. Slightly above average height, of sturdy build, he was always self-conscious about an eye disfigurement; in maturity his was a solemn and imposing presence.<br>
<br>As a lecturer, committee man, writer, and teacher of Irish, Pearse was respected within the Gaelic League for his dedication, prodigious appetite for work, and high-mindedness, though his reserve precluded popularity. From 1903 to 1909 he was paid editor of the league organ, <span class="italic">An Claidheamh Soluis</span>. Although the league had to control his over-ambition and financial recklessness he was a success because of his enthusiasm and industry, and because of his innumerable thoughtful, passionate, and often provocative and courageous articles on such topics as education, history, literature, politics, religion, and theatre. Unlike many elements in Irish-Ireland, he was a modernizer who, for instance, put aside his youthful prejudices against Irish literature in the English language to welcome the contribution to literature of controversial figures like J. M. Synge and W. B. Yeats, and who embraced the Belgian model of bilingualism with enthusiasm. In his twenties the Irish language was his paramount concern: in its interests, although himself a nationalist, he praised certain measures of the British government, and, although a devout Catholic, on occasion fiercely criticized the Irish clergy.<br>
<br>During this period Pearse taught Irish extensively, and in 1908 founded St Enda's, a boys' bilingual secondary school (in 1910 he founded a girls' school, St Ita's, which collapsed two years later). He was a gifted, humane, and exciting&#151;even mesmerizing&#151;headmaster with a talented staff, and his selflessness and nobility were inspiring: the school was initially a triumph. In 1910, irresponsibly, he moved St Enda's to grand premises outside Dublin, where perforce it became a boarding-school. Henceforward he fought a constant battle to avoid bankruptcy. James Stephens wrote that &#145;when something had to be done he did it, and entirely disregarded logic or economics or force&#146;  (Dudley Edwards, 1990, edn, 343). As with teaching and journalism, so with literature: he developed what talent he had to the full, writing short stories, poems, and plays in Irish and English, which ranged from the mawkish to the genuinely moving.<br>
<br>Until 1910 Pearse's nationalist preoccupation was cultural: the school, like his other activities, was geared to spread the gospel of Gaelic-Ireland. But as he became disillusioned with the language movement and worn down by financial worries he increasingly developed his romantic and morbid fascination with people who had died in hopeless revolt; martyrdom became an important theme. In 1912 he called publicly for support for the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, while threatening revolution if it were not passed. Yeats thought him &#145;a dangerous man; he has the vertigo of self-sacrifice&#146;  (Dudley Edwards, 1990, edn, 335).<br>
<br>The foundation in November 1912 of the anti-home rule Ulster Volunteers led a year later to the counter-balancing Irish Volunteers, of which Pearse was a co-founder and in which he was a highly enthusiastic participant at a senior level. Shortly afterwards he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and went to America to raise funds for St Enda's. Mixing with hardline Irish-Americans who wanted only to hear that insurrection was nigh set him single-mindedly on a revolutionary course. Back home, valued by the IRB strategists as a fine and passionate orator and a highly persuasive political propagandist, in 1915 he was brought into their inner circle. In 1916 he published several political pamphlets justifying a military uprising, and on Easter Monday he and six IRB colleagues issued a proclamation declaring an Irish republic; Pearse was designated commandant-general and president of the provisional republic. A thousand Irish Volunteers and 120 members of the Irish Citizen Army formed by James Connolly took over major Dublin buildings. Pearse and Connolly were based in the General Post Office, with Connolly directing operations and Pearse producing morale-boosting propaganda. As a consequence of the fighting between the rebels and the British army about 250 uninvolved civilians were killed; on Saturday 29 April, Pearse surrendered to avoid further deaths. He was court-martialled and on 3 May 1916 executed by a firing squad in Kilmainham gaol, Dublin, as, on 4 May, was his brother, Willie, who had acted as his aide-de-camp. He was buried in the gaol. After her brothers' deaths, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59641/', "Margaret Mary Pearse")</script> did much to preserve their memory, and later held the co. Dublin seat in the D&aacute;il. As the figurehead of the rising, and the author of memorable verse and prose in which militarism was equated with heroic self-sacrifice, Pearse became the most famous of the fifteen executed rebels and the centre of a powerful mythology: each generation of irredentist republicans has cited his uncompromising words in justification of their terror campaigns.<br>
