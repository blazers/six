<span class="headword">Phayre <span class="st"> [Phaire]</span>,  Robert</span>  (1618/19&#150;1682), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was almost certainly the son of the Revd Emmanuel Phayre. The father had migrated, probably from Devon, to Ireland, where he held ecclesiastical livings in co. Cork. Both father and son sustained losses during the uprising of 1641, when they were living near Duhallow in the north of the county. Robert Phayre was then farming in a modest way. In 1642 he asserted that he had endured losses totalling &pound;51 10<i>s</i>. Like neighbours among the protestant settlers he enlisted in the force commanded by Inchiquin in an effort to contain the Irish Catholic insurgents and recover possessions. By September 1646 he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the regiment of Richard Townshend. Phayre did not follow his general, the earl of Inchiquin, in defecting to the king, and was arrested by Inchiquin in the spring of 1648.<br>
<br>Freed after an exchange of prisoners, Phayre next made his way to England where he appeared as a volunteer in Thomas Fairfax's parliamentarian force. Shortly afterwards, in January 1649, he was one of the officers in London to whom the warrant for Charles I's execution was directed. He was among the halberdiers who guarded Whitehall while the sentence was carried out. In the autumn of 1649 he returned to Ireland to assist in the reconquest. Serving under Roger Boyle, Lord Broghill, he fought chiefly in his own province of Munster, taking part in the victory in Macroom on 10 April 1650. His enthusiasm for and prominence in the cause of the English Commonwealth led to his appointment in 1651 as governor of co. Cork. As well as overseeing numerous administrative tasks in the aftermath of warfare, he supported religious and political radicals. This offended the more orthodox within the local protestant community. At the same time he treated some defeated Catholics, notably Lord and Lady Muskerry, compassionately. Phayre's loyalties lay with the Commonwealth: reservations about the &#145;Instrument of government&#146; and Cromwell's advance to the position of protector may explain his retirement from the governorship of Cork in 1654. In the same year, however, at the age of thirty-five, he was appointed to the commission of the peace in that county. The authorities were perturbed when he protected Quakers, whom he credited with doing more to advance godliness than any other group during the past century.<br>
<br>Phayre's army service was rewarded with the grant of lands confiscated from the defeated Irish Catholics. To these he added through private transactions. In particular he became involved in the exploitation of the dense woodlands and iron ore deposits around Enniscorthy, co. Wexford, where he and other soldiers from his regiment had been allocated lands. Earlier, in 1654, he had been charged by the state with preserving the depleted woods in co. Cork and settled at Rostellan, where he was still living in 1664. These private and profitable projects occupied him during the time of Henry Cromwell's government in Ireland, the conservative tenor of which did not please Phayre. Between 1657 and 1658 he was in London to negotiate a partnership to exploit the Enniscorthy property. Phayre had married, probably a woman named Houghton, by 10 March 1653, when a letter to him referred to his &#145;wife and little babes&#146;; they are known to have had two sons (both of whom predeceased Phayre) and two daughters  (Welply, 30.22). Following his first wife's death Phayre married on 16 August 1658 at St Werburgh's, Dublin, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1698?), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13049/', "Thomas Herbert")</script>, attendant to Charles I in 1647&#150;9. Together they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>The fall of the protectorate and the advent of a more radical regime both in Ireland and England led to his receiving a new commission, on 8 July 1659, as a colonel of foot under Edmund Ludlow. Phayre had been on hand in London on 27 June 1659 to present a petition from republican officers in Ireland to parliament. In Ireland, he again acted as governor of Cork. But once the restoration of Charles II became inevitable, he was vulnerable on account alike of his opinions and record. He had been seized during the coup engineered by more conservative officers in December 1659. He was arrested again at Cork on 18 May 1660, and then transported to England. Although imprisoned in the Tower of London, he escaped trial thanks to the intercession of royalists whom he had befriended during the interregnum and of his father-in-law, Herbert. However, he was not released until 1662, when he was permitted to return to Ireland. There he soon came under fresh suspicion of complicity in a plot to surprise Dublin Castle in 1663. He had not severed his links with republican comrades of the 1650s. Indeed John Lisle was assassinated while visiting Edmund Ludlow in his Swiss exile in 1664 when allegedly he was mistaken for Phayre.<br>
<br>In Ireland, though he was watched closely, Phayre was not ostracized. He continued to develop iron-works in co. Wexford and his own estate at Grange, near Ovens in co. Cork, where he settled in his later years. He was also still involved in the timber trade. Nor had he forsaken his search for spiritual satisfaction. He patronized the co. Waterford healer Valentine Greatorex (who had earlier served in Phayre's own regiment), and still kept the company of the Quakers. He entertained William Penn, the son of another settler in co. Cork, when the Quaker visited Ireland in 1669&#150;70. But it was as a disciple of Lodowick Muggleton, encountered in London in 1662 while under restraint, that Phayre ended his idiosyncratic quest for religious truth. In worldly terms, to judge from his will, he had prospered. He died at Grange between his making it, on 13 September 1682, and its proof on 13 November 1682, and was probably buried in the family plot belonging to his son-in-law, the Cork merchant, Quaker, and former Muggletonian George Gamble, in the parish of St John of Jerusalem in the south liberties of Cork.<br>
