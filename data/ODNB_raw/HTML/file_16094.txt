<span class="headword">Latham,  Robert Gordon</span>  (1812&#150;1888), <span class="occ">ethnologist and philologist</span>, was born on 24 March 1812 at Billingborough, Lincolnshire, the eldest son of the Revd Thomas Latham (1770/71&#150;1846). Educated at Eton College, and a contemporary of his future brother-in-law Sir Edward Creasy (1812&#150;1878), he entered King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar in 1829 and became a fellow in 1832. He graduated in January 1833 and took his MA in 1836. In 1833 visits to Hamburg and Copenhagen, followed by a year of language studies in Norway, led to his delightful <span class="italic">Norway and the Norwegians</span> (1840). With Creasy he had previously translated, in 1838, Esaias T&eacute;gner's <span class="italic">Axel</span> and <span class="italic">Frithiofs saga</span>.<br>
<br>From 1839 to 1845 Latham was professor of English language and literature at University College, London, but he simultaneously developed a medical career, qualifying as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1842, taking his Cambridge MD in 1844, and being elected an FRCP in 1846. Initially physician to the St James's and St George's Dispensary, in 1844 he became assistant physician at the Middlesex Hospital, London, where he lectured on forensic medicine and materia medica. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1848.<br>
<br>Latham's <span class="italic">The English Language</span> (1841) became a standard text until the 1870s. He wrote many other grammatical works and advocated spelling reform, but his consuming passion was ethnology&#151;the study of the varieties of mankind and its languages, and the enigma of human origins. In <span class="italic">Man and his Migrations</span> (1851), seven years before the first pronouncement by Darwin and Wallace on evolution by natural selection, Latham speculated on human development from &#145;some species &hellip; lower in the scale of Nature&#146;  (p. 50).<br>
<br>Latham acquired a light-hearted semi-fictional existence in <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> for 1846 as the Cambridge Travelling Bachelor, in his contributions to the <span class="roman">Tipperary Papers</span> with Creasy and John Sheehan. A description of the bachelor ethnologist's &#145;learnedly and fancifully decorated&#146; lodgings, including the &#145;hunting dress of an Ojibbeway Indian and the Sunday clothes of a German Professor lying about promiscuously&#146;, carries conviction  (<span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, 19.520). On 19 July 1848 he married Elizabeth, daughter of George Cottam, engineer. As a result of his marriage he gave up his fellowship of King's (only bachelors could hold fellowships for life), and he also gave up his medical practice.<br>
<br>Latham's first, seminal work in ethnology was <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Varieties of Man</span> (1850), followed by other ethnological works, both general and specific, on the colonies, the British Isles, Europe, the Russian empire, and India. He was vice-president of the Ethnological Society, wrote particularly on Native American languages for the Philological Society, and was a member of several other learned societies. He was uniquely qualified for his appointment as director of the ethnological department at the Crystal Palace in 1852. Latham's independence of mind led him in 1862 to question the widely held belief that India was the Aryan motherland, an eccentricity which destroyed his reputation. Only in 1887 did Isaac Taylor, in a paper read to the Royal Anthropological Institute, revive Latham's theory that the Aryans came from south-east of Lithuania, giving impetus to further research into Indo-European origins.<br>
<br>After 1862 Latham's most significant works were a major new edition (1866&#150;70) of Dr Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> and, notably, <span class="italic">The &#145;Hamlet&#146; of Saxo Grammaticus and of Shakespeare</span> (1872). By 1863 he was in financial difficulties and was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100. During the late 1860s and the 1870s he came to know Theodore Watts-Dunton well and introduced him to Thomas Gordon Hake, who in turn introduced them to George Borrow. Hake's <span class="italic">Memoirs of Eighty Years</span> (1892) are not kind to Latham in the 1860s, describing a decline in habits and appearance, despite his &#145;handsome person&#146; and &#145;kindly nature&#146;&#151;&#145;like a clergyman of a less reputable type; his white necktie unlaundressed, his fine chin ill-shaven, his black coat unskilfully brushed, if at all&#146;  (Hake, 208&#150;12). Watts-Dunton's comments in Latham's obituary  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 17 March 1888) show greater understanding and admiration of his &#145;brilliance of intellect and encyclopaedic knowledge&#146;  (Watts, 340). This brilliance did not, unfortunately, lead to clarity or even accuracy of presentation. His erudite writings remain indigestible despite their historical interest.<br>
<br>Latham ultimately developed aphasia&#151;a sad end to a lifetime devoted to language in all its varieties. He died on 9 March 1888 at his home at 156 Upper Richmond Road, Putney, London. He was survived by his wife, and at least one daughter, Clara.<br>
