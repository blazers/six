<span class="headword">Herle,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1588/9), <span class="occ">political agent</span>, was the son of Thomas Herle of Montgomery and his wife. His father was a half-brother to Sir Richard Herbert (1468&#150;1539). He had at least one brother and a sister. His early life is obscure but he was well educated with a good knowledge of languages, including Latin, Flemish, and Italian, and probably also French and Spanish.<br>
<br>Herle was in Antwerp in February 1559 when he sent Sir William Cecil, principal secretary, a letter containing news from the Low Countries. Disguised as a merchant, he travelled in 1560&#150;62 to northern Germany where he established contacts with the nobility. He was back in London in July 1564, begging Cecil for his assistance in the case of Augier de l'Estrille who had been illegally captured by Herle and his fellow petitioners following an act of piracy. Herle continued to dabble with piracy and the privy council sent him to the Marshalsea prison on 13 November 1570. He entreated, both in English and Latin, for Cecil's help. From April 1571 he acted as a prison spy for Cecil. He played an important role in supplying information against Charles Bailly, a participant in the Ridolfi Plot of 1572. At the beginning of the year he uncovered a plot by Kenelm Berney and Edmund Mather to assassinate Cecil&#151;having probably encouraged them in their plotting in order to impress his patron all the more by the revelation of it.<br>
<br>Herle was sent by Cecil, now Lord Burghley, to the Low Countries and returned in June 1573 with a long dispatch recording his conversations with William, prince of Orange. Cecil used this dispatch as an argument for aiding the Dutch, but Elizabeth I was not prepared, at this time, to quarrel with the Spanish. Herle spent the next few years in London, at Redcross Street, where he busied himself on behalf both of Paul Buys, the Dutch envoy, and of the English merchants trading with the Low Countries. He probably did not marry but he had a relationship with Rosa Jones and they had at least one illegitimate daughter, Jana, who was baptized at Guilsfield, Montgomeryshire, on 23 October 1576. In February 1582, when Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, escorted Fran&ccedil;ois, duke of Alen&ccedil;on, as far as Antwerp on his return to France, Herle accompanied them. He later claimed that he had been left in Antwerp as Leicester's agent. He was assiduous, during the spring and summer of 1584, in supplying information to Burghley and to Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, on affairs in the Low Countries. Fear of imprisonment for debt rather than a desire for public service kept him in Antwerp and his letters frequently plead for assistance with his debts. In April 1583 the Spanish ambassador noted that the queen had sent Herle to Cologne. He was appointed ambassador to Emden on 8 June 1584 and instructed to reconcile Count John and Count Edzard of Emden, the joint rulers of East Friesland, and he remained there until the spring of 1585.<br>
<br>On his return to England, Herle was again involved in English policy towards the Low Countries. Disagreements between Burghley and Leicester are probably behind a series of letters in which Herle explained that Burghley's role in Anglo&#150;Dutch relations was unpopular and the queen's vacillating attitude unhelpful. Burghley took this candour in good part and justified his stance. He wished to explain his position and Herle was well placed to make the contents of these letters generally known. However, Burghley was not pleased when he discovered that Herle had shown the letters at court. Herle may have been acting on Leicester and Walsingham's behalf in trying to induce Burghley into more actively supporting the protestant cause in the Low Countries. Despite this his relationship with Burghley was reinforced by joint economic ventures.<br>
<br>Leicester led an English army to the Low Countries in December 1585 and Herle followed him in February 1586. The privy council ordered Leicester to send him again to Emden in order to mediate in the quarrel between Emden and the states of Holland and West Friesland, which was preventing English trade. The embassy met with little success and Leicester himself had to overcome the difficulties over trading. Despite his failure, Herle was sent in July 1586 as an envoy to Utrecht. He returned to London on 22 August 1586. He was elected MP for Callington, Cornwall, on his return, probably through Burghley's influence, enabling him to avoid his creditors. While Herle supplied both Walsingham and Burghley with information during 1587 and 1588, he failed to receive any further commissions. An appeal to Burghley on 3 May 1588 for employment and for help with his debts was answered with an annuity from the exchequer. Herle died in the parish of St Clement without the bars of the New Temple towards the end of 1588 or at the beginning of 1589; the administration of his estate was granted on 8 February 1589.<br>
<br>Herle's mastery of foreign languages enabled him to play a small part in England's relations with the Low Countries. Except for his embassies to Emden and to Utrecht, neither of which was notably successful, his role while abroad was to provide information, which he did in many prolix letters. A great part of his life was spent battling against ill health and in coping with his debts. In 1571 he obtained the office of rhaglaw of Cardiganshire and he believed that the profits of this office would provide him with financial security; after years of struggle, the Cardiganshire gentry defeated him. Still in debt, Herle was content to go to the Low Countries where he could avoid his creditors. His many requests for a permanent position were ignored by his powerful friends and this suggests that they considered him useful but not entirely trustworthy.<br>
