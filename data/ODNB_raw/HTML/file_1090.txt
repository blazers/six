<span class="headword">Baines, Sir  Edward</span>  (1800&#150;1890), <span class="occ">journalist, politician, and educationist</span>, was born in Leeds on 28 May 1800, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1089/', "Edward Baines (1774&#150;1848)")</script>, editor of the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of Matthew Talbot, a Leeds currier. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1092/', "Matthew Talbot Baines")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1096/', "Thomas Baines")</script> were his brothers. Known until his father's death as Edward Baines junior, he was first educated at a private school in Leeds, then sent to New College, Manchester, a leading grammar school for protestant dissenters, where John Dalton, the eminent chemist, taught mathematics. There, aged fourteen, he started to teach in Independent (later Congregational) Sunday schools, which he continued to do until elected to parliament in 1859; his dissenting faith underpinned all his public actions. In 1815 he began to work for his father's newspaper, travelling widely as a reporter, and working as an editor from 1818. In 1827 his father took him into partnership, and in 1829 he married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1881), the only daughter of Thomas Blackburn of Liverpool. They had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>As a journalist, Baines covered the considerable unrest in the north after the end of the Napoleonic wars, exposing the government <i>agent-provocateur</i> Oliver the Spy&#151;the first public example of his personal courage and sense of justice. They emerged again when he reported from the speakers' platform at the Peterloo massacre of 16 August 1819 in Manchester, taking the side of the peaceful demonstrators against local magistrates. For the rest of his life he played an ambivalent and frequently controversial role in popular demands for political reform; his more inflammatory writings often encouraged these demands among working-class groups, which pressure he used to foster middle-class radical programmes as a prophylactic against &#145;democracy&#146;. For decades he trod an uneasy path between the various groups, excoriated as the mouthpiece of &#145;Bainesocracy&#146; by working-class radicals and distrusted by other middle-class reformers, such as the leaders of the Manchester school of political and economic liberalism. As such he reinforced provincial divisions as well as serving as a major protester against a political world dominated by London and landed Anglicans; the tension was only partly abated when his elder brother, Matthew, who had become an Anglican, served as Palmerston's chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster from 1855 to 1858.<br>
<br>Baines's espousal of a limited extension of the franchise to those with a stake in property, and the creation of new industrial constituencies, underpinned his support for the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> and the subsequent programme of Liberal reforms, although he was disappointed by their limited extent. He supported the new poor law of 1834 and then turned to attack protectionism in the form of the corn laws. In 1835 he published a <span class="italic">History of the Cotton Manufacture in Great Britain</span>. His attempts to seek compromise with the great Yorkshire landowners brought him into frequent conflict with the more radical Lancashire spokesmen, Cobden and Bright, but he gave support to Sir Robert Peel's dismantling of the corn laws in 1846. His advocacy of economic change also brought him into conflict with gentry and working-class leaders demanding factory reform and limited working hours in the Ten Hours Movement. This antipathy continued with the emergence of the more generalized demands of Chartism and mass demonstrations in Yorkshire. Baines deplored any state-imposed limits on individual economic freedom and began in his twenties to produce accounts of material progress, which made him one of the first &#145;scientific&#146; polemicists of the industrial revolution and its rapidly growing towns. The collation of statistical trends remained a feature of his writings, most noticeably in <span class="italic">The Social, Educational and Religious State of the Manufacturing Districts</span> (1843). His approach left him open to criticism that he ignored present miseries, to which he argued always that the answer to these lay in economic progress and moral change rooted in individual responsibility.<br>
<br>This outworking of Baines's &#145;nonconformist conscience&#146; was accompanied by a passionate belief in the need for widespread education. Characteristically, he avoided any suggestion of state involvement in this until he was in his late sixties. Instead, he became a leading proponent of educational voluntarism for learners of all ages. A founder member of the Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society for his own class, he turned his attention to working-class adult education after attending Dr George Birkbeck's first mechanics' institute in London in 1824. Baines was instrumental in founding several similar bodies in Yorkshire during the 1820s, bringing them together in 1837 in the West Riding (subsequently Yorkshire) Union of Mechanics' Institutes, of which he was president for forty-four years. Later, he was a leading figure in the setting up of the Yorkshire Village Library, which provided 27,000 volumes to some 144 villages. His concern to provide an educated workforce for the new industrial society extended eventually into schools, where his advocacy was much more controversial. Central to his beliefs was the assumption that people valued most that for which they paid and which they controlled. After a visit to the model factory system at New Lanark, although he disliked many of Robert Owen's views, Baines emphasized the duty of employers to support education for their workers' children. When limited state aid for schools, together with inspection, was introduced in the 1830s he opposed it on the grounds that it would remove individual responsibility for self-improvement and enhance the power of the Church of England&#151;particularly of its high-church wing which he opposed vociferously as &#145;papist&#146;, despite his having supported Catholic emancipation in 1829. On this he differed sharply from some other nonconformist apologists but his editorials and prolific pamphleteering, with titles such as <span class="italic">An alarm to the nation, on the unjust, unconstitutional and dangerous measure of state education proposed by the government</span> (1847), served to sustain an extra-parliamentary voluntarist opposition which hindered repeated government attempts to extend publicly funded education. In the late 1860s he underwent a volte-face when his membership of the Taunton commission on endowed schools convinced him that, if the education of the middle classes was so inadequately served, then that of the working classes needed stronger support than voluntarism had so far provided. Thus he supported W. E. Forster's <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> of 1870, but only because it was essentially permissive. After that he became instrumental in founding the Yorkshire College of Science, the forerunner of the University of Leeds, whose Victorian Gothic Baines wing is a memorial to his serving as chairman of its council from 1880 until 1887.<br>
<br>Baines followed in his father and elder brother's footsteps when he was elected MP for Leeds in 1859, after which he remained a firmly independent member of the Liberal groupings. From supporting Cobden's negotiation of a commercial treaty with France in 1860, an outcome of his free trade principles, he turned his attention to demanding an extended franchise. His view was that the growing respectability of many artisans justified an extension in the borough voting qualification from the &pound;10 requirement of the 1832 act to &pound;6. When the government refused to initiate legislation, he introduced private members' bills in 1861, 1864, and 1865. All were rejected but they served to feed the growing demand for reform. Even so, Disraeli's &#145;leap in the dark&#146; <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1867 went much further than Baines thought prudent. His ambivalent attitude to the new working-class electorate showed in his handling of his Leeds constituency and he was voted out of parliament in the 1874 election. W. E. Gladstone sent him an emollient letter of praise for his &#145;single-minded devotion, courage of purpose, perfect integrity and ability&#146; in servicing the Liberal cause and it marked the effective end of his party political career  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). The remainder of his life was spent in local campaigns for sabbatarianism and teetotalism, which he had first espoused in 1837, in active journalism (which he only gave up in 1888), and as a continued champion of industrial Yorkshire's identity. In 1875 he provided a chapter on the history of the county's woollen trade for his brother Thomas's <span class="italic">Yorkshire Past and Present</span>, in which the first of the four volumes contained an engraving of a photograph of him.<br>
<br>Baines's own literary works included accounts of foreign travel, such as <span class="italic">A Visit to the Vaudois of Piedmont</span> (1855), and a biography of his father (1851), as well as numerous pamphlets on the causes he espoused so strongly. On his eightieth birthday a presentation was made to him in recognition of his service to the town in the Albert Hall in Leeds; he gave the &pound;3000 raised to the Yorkshire College of Science. At various times he served as a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1881 he was knighted. He died on 2 March 1890 at his house, St Ann's Hill, Burley, Yorkshire. In his will he left estate valued at &pound;165,818 gross, including a controlling interest in the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>, to be divided among his children, with minor gifts to friends and servants. He was buried near Woodhouse Moor in the Leeds municipal cemetery, now a landscaped garden surrounded by the University of Leeds.<br>
