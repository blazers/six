<span class="headword">Hooke,  John</span>  (1655&#150;1712), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Drogheda, Ireland, the eldest son of John Hooke, a merchant, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Christopher Hooke of Alway, Gloucestershire. The Jacobite politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13691/', "Nathaniel Hooke (1664&#150;1738)")</script> was his brother. John was educated at Kilkenny School and on 28 June 1672 entered as a pensioner at Trinity College, Dublin, under the tuition of Richard Acton of Drogheda. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 3 February 1675 and was called to the bar on 8 February 1681. His wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1736), was the daughter of Major-General John Lambert. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13692/', "Nathaniel Hooke (d. 1763)")</script>, wrote a history of Rome.<br>
<br>Following the revolution of 1688 Hooke achieved office on 15 August 1689 as second justice of Anglesey, Caernarfon, and Merioneth, rising to chief justice there on 2 May 1695. Also in 1695 he became deputy to Sir J. Coombes as chief justice of Chester. On 8 March 1699 a meeting was held at Hooke's house in Lincoln's Inn which resulted in the foundation of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK). Hooke was the organization's first treasurer, and it continued to meet in his residence for the next three years. In November 1700 he was made a serjeant-at-law, his patrons being Lord Guilford (another founder member of the society) and Sir Nathan Wright (the new lord keeper). However, Hooke was not reappointed a Welsh judge on the accession of Queen Anne.<br>
<br>Hooke returned to office as chief justice of Anglesey in May 1706, although he was still practising as a barrister in Chester in August of that year. In 1707 he was accused by Lord Bulkeley of demanding presents, which was examined by a committee of the House of Commons. Hooke's explanation that it was merely a customary present from the town of Beaumaris was not sufficient to sway the committee which found him guilty, but when the matter was reported to the house he was exonerated by a vote of 178 to 130. Hooke's politics are difficult to determine, and he himself rejected a party label, informing Robert Harley, the new chief minister, that &#145;I cannot list myself under either of the two common denominations, Whig or Tory&#146;. Further he did not support &#145;an absolute unlimited Toleration&#146;, but opposed &#145;persecuting good loyal Protestants who agreed with the Church in fundamentals&#146;  (Rose, 173, 188). Hooke was removed from office in 1711 and died in 1712, affirming in his will of February 1711 (proved in May 1712) his &#145;zeal for true and pure Christianity and moderation&#146;  (Woolrych, 2. 467).<br>
