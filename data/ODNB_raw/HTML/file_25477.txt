<span class="headword">Shuckard,  William Edward</span>  (1802/3&#150;1868), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was the eldest son of Johann Leonhardt Schuckardt of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, who settled in England in 1787 and married in 1793. Johann Schuckardt Anglicized his name to Leonard Shuckard, and about 1802 leased the Old Ship (then Brighton's principal hotel), in partnership with Alexander Hicks.<br>
<br>William Shuckard was well educated, and then placed in the house of Baldwin, Craddock, and Joy, publishers, of Paternoster Row, London. He lodged first with his maternal uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6191/', "William Bernard Cooke (1778&#150;1855)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65034/', "Cooke family (per. c.1800&#150;1865)")</script>], a line engraver of Soho Square. However, Shuckard's fondness for &#145;midnight readings&#146; led to friction with his uncle (and the resultant oversleeping led to several threats of dismissal from work). Shuckard moved from his uncle's house and for some time lodged instead at Bateman's Buildings, Holborn, but continued neglect of his duties led to his dismissal. He returned to live with his father at Brighton, where it was hoped he would start up as a bookseller. His father was also keen for him to gain some experience of the German book trade, and sent Shuckard to a firm of booksellers, possibly at Frankfurt or Leipzig.<br>
<br>On 19 November 1829 at St Pancras Old Church, Shuckard married Sarah Ann, daughter of Mr Martin of Horsted Keynes, Sussex. From about 1832 Shuckard attempted to move into writing, and took on occasional sub-editing duties at a local Brighton newspaper. His leisure hours were devoted to entomology, and he soon became an expert in the study. He was a member of the Entomological Society's publications committee, and on 2 April 1835 was appointed librarian to the Royal Society. He held the latter post until 9 November 1843, when he was dismissed for being insolvent, the result of &#145;the too strenuous pursuit of the science of entomology and the publication upon it&#146;  (MC 3.310, Royal Society).<br>
<br>In 1844, through the influence of the entomologist William Wilson Saunders (1809&#150;1879), Shuckard obtained the post of editor of <span class="italic">Lloyds List</span>, which he held until his retirement in 1861. In that same year, Shuckard borrowed a large number of insects from the Entomological Society, the East India House, and his fellow entomologists Frederick William Hope and John Obadiah Westwood. However, at some later stage, financial difficulties led to Shuckard's pawning the borrowed specimens, and subsequently being unable to buy them back. As a result, Westwood had to re-purchase both his own insects and those belonging to Hope.<br>
<br>Despite being dogged by financial troubles Shuckard saw a number of works into print, including <span class="italic">Essay on the Indigenous Fossorial Hymenoptera</span> (1837); <span class="italic">Elements of British Entomology</span> (1839); <span class="italic">The British Coleoptera Delineated</span>, with drawings by William Spry (1840); &#145;On the history and natural arrangement of insects&#146;, in Lardner's <span class="italic">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</span>, 10 (1840), written in conjunction with William Swainson; <span class="italic">Catalogues of the miscellaneous manuscripts and of the manuscript letters in the possession of the Royal Society</span> (1840); and <span class="italic">British Bees</span> (1866).<br>
<br>Shuckard also produced a number of works that were translations of German originals. They included <span class="italic">A Manual of Entomology, from the German of Dr Hermann Burmeister</span> (1836); <span class="italic">Travels in the East</span> (1847), from the work by Tischendorf; and <span class="italic">Chamber and Cage Birds</span> (1848), a translation of Johann Bechstein's work, which went through many editions. Some sixteen papers on entomological subjects were also written by him, and appeared in various scientific journals between 1836 and 1842. He died on 10 November 1868 at the Oval Road, Kennington, and was survived by at least one son.<br>
