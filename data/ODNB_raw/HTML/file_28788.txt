<span class="headword">Warren,  Richard</span>  (1731&#150;1797), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Cavendish, Suffolk, on 4 December 1731, was the third son of Dr Richard Warren (1681&#150;1748), archdeacon of Suffolk and rector of Cavendish, and his wife, Priscilla (<i>d</i>. 1774), daughter of John Fenner. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28777/', "John Warren (1730&#150;1800)")</script>, bishop of Bangor, and, like him, was educated at Cavendish School in Bury St Edmunds. He entered Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1748, shortly after the death of his father, and graduated BA as fourth wrangler in 1752, obtaining in succeeding years the prizes awarded to middle and senior bachelors for proficiency in Latin prose composition. He proceeded MA in 1755 and MD on 3 July 1762. He was a fellow between 1756 and 1759.<br>
<br>Warren was tutor at Jesus College to the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25264/', "Peter Shaw (1694&#150;1763)")</script>, physician-in-ordinary to George II and George III. He gained Shaw's esteem, married his daughter Elizabeth in 1759, and in 1763 succeeded to his father-in-law's practice. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1762.<br>
<br>Shortly after Warren began to practise, Sir Edward Wilmot, physician to the court and son-in-law of Richard Mead, recommended him as a suitable assistant for his attendance on Princess Amelia. When Wilmot retired, Warren continued to act as physician to the princess, and by her influence was appointed physician to George III in 1762, after the resignation of his father-in-law. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 3 March 1763, and delivered the Goulstonian lectures at the college in 1764 and the Harveian oration in 1768. He acted as censor in 1764, 1776, and 1782. On 9 August 1784 he was named an elect.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1756, having at that time a licence <i>ad practicandum</i> from the University of Cambridge, Warren was elected a physician to the Middlesex Hospital, and on 21 January 1760 he became physician to St George's Hospital. The former appointment he resigned in November 1758, the latter in May 1766. In 1787 he was appointed physician to the prince of Wales, and was the most sought-after society doctor of that time; a pre-eminence which he maintained to the last. Warren's annual income was in excess of anything previously accrued from the practice of medicine in Britain. He is said to have earned &pound;9000 a year from the time of the onset of George III's insanity in 1788, and he bequeathed to his family upwards of &pound;150,000. He had a reputation for exceptional powers of mind and solidity of judgement.<br>
<br>Warren published two papers in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Royal College of Physicians. His <span class="italic">Oratio ex Harveii instituto</span> was published in 1769.<br>
<br>Warren died at his house in Dover Street, London, on 23 June 1797, leaving a widow, eight sons, and two daughters. He was buried in Kensington church on 30 June 1797. Elizabeth Inchbald, who had a great admiration for him, produced some mourning verses to his memory, addressed to Mrs Warren. Of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28776/', "Frederick Warren (1775&#150;1848)")</script> became a rear-admiral and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28785/', "Pelham Warren (1778&#150;1835)")</script> became a physician.<br>
