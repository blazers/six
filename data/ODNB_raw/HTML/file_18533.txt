<span class="headword">Beauclerk <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mellon; <em>other married name </em>Coutts]</span>,  Harriot</span>, duchess of St Albans  (1777?&#150;1837), <span class="occ">actress and banker</span>, was probably born on 11 November 1777, probably the illegitimate daughter of Sarah Mellon, an Irish wardrobe-keeper in Kena's company of strolling players, the lowest level of the theatrical world and regarded in law as rogues and vagabonds. Sarah Mellon claimed to have been married to and deserted by Harriot's father, Lieutenant Mathew Mellon of the Madras infantry, but the ceremony cannot be verified. On 14 July 1782 Sarah married Thomas Entwisle, a musician in Kena's company. Harriot received some education in Lancashire, where the Entwisles worked in Bibby's company. She began to work as a child actor, and on 16 October 1787, in a barn doing duty for a theatre in Ulverstone, she appeared as Little Pickle in the farce <span class="italic">The Spoiled Child</span> and became an instant success. The family later joined Stanton's company in the midlands, where Harriot earned a guinea a week. She was seen there by the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who eventually engaged her for Drury Lane Theatre, where she appeared as Lydia Languish in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> on 31 January 1795.<br>
<br>From then until 1815 Harriot Mellon played an extensive range of parts in both London and the provincial theatre. Her most successful role was Volante in John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honey Moon</span> (1805). She never reached the first rank of actresses&#151;Dorothy Jordan and Sarah Siddons were not challenged by her&#151;but she was praised for her good-natured readiness to take over parts in cases of illness, afterwards returning with good humour to the secondary roles she was accustomed to play. In her published memoirs, fellow actress Anne Mathews described her as &#145;a young, glowing beauty, endued with great natural powers of mind, talents and vivacity, but &hellip; an insuperable rusticity of air and manners&#146;. On 7 February 1815, as Audrey in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, she made her last appearance on the stage, at Drury Lane. She was then earning &pound;12 a week, far more than she could have earned, as a woman without education or patronage, in any other respectable occupation.<br>
<br>During Mellon's early years in the theatre, there was never a whisper of impropriety about her behaviour, but for ten years (1805&#150;15) she was intimate with the banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6469/', "Thomas Coutts (1735&#150;1822)")</script>, one of the richest men in London, who assisted her living in great style. In February 1815, after the death of his first wife, they were married at St Pancras Church, but the marriage was declared invalid, and they went through a second ceremony on 12 April 1815. Coutts was seventy-nine, Harriot thirty-seven. The pre-marriage contract specified that Harriot should retain control of her own estates and properties through trustees. Coutts's three daughters, who had previously been friendly with Harriot, were furious about the marriage and treated their stepmother very badly thereafter. Each had married into the aristocracy and received a large dowry, but their father's marriage damaged their longer-term prospects of inheriting from him. Lady Guilford and Sir Francis Burdett were particularly hostile. This grieved Coutts, who constantly said how happy his wife made him, and when he died, in 1822, he left Harriot the whole of his vast fortune and his partnership in Coutts Bank, without mentioning any other person or leaving a single legacy. He thus left his widow to decide whether she wished to share his estate with his children to any degree whatever.<br>
<br>Harriot Coutts proved to be an excellent businesswoman and banker, taking an active role in investment and management decisions. She was also extremely generous to Coutts's daughters, giving them each &pound;10,000 per annum. In return they expressed nothing but ingratitude and hostility. Regarded as an adventuress who had preyed on an old man, Harriot was lampooned, caricatured, and mocked for her extravagant lifestyle and her generous giving to the poor. Sir Walter Scott, however, found her &#145;a kind, friendly woman, without either affectation or insolence in the display of her wealth&#146;  (Lockhart, 8.72). Portraits of Harriot were painted by Romney, Beechey, and Masquerier, among others.<br>
<br>Harriot's weakness was her desire to be <i>haut ton</i>, the height of every social climber's ambition, but she was never fully admitted to the inner circles of the aristocracy, even after she married on 16 June 1827 William Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, ninth duke of St Albans (1801&#150;1849). The duke was twenty-six, Harriot forty-nine. Many considered the duke to be simple-minded, but others found him kind and gentle; the marriage was broadly successful. Harriot thus proved twice over that marriages could be happy even though the world considered the partners mismatched. Observers regarded their union as an exchange of wealth for a title, but that was no uncommon practice among the aristocracy.<br>
<br>The duchess of St Albans died on 6 August 1837 at her home, 80 Piccadilly, London, and was buried in the parish church at Redbourne, Lincolnshire, the St Albans family seat, on 19 August. She left her husband &pound;10,000 a year for his lifetime, and two large houses in London and one in Highgate, with their contents. She continued to direct his life from beyond the grave: a condition of her will was that neither of his brothers, lords Frederick and Charles Beauclerk, or their families, were to reside with him for as much as one week in a year. If they did, all her bequests to him would cease. The Beauclerks had greatly offended her some years earlier. She left &pound;20,000 in trust for the benefit of Sophia Burdett, Coutts's daughter, &#145;the sum being over and above the sums that I have already given to her amounting to &pound;118,602 15<i>s</i> 0<i>d</i>&#146;, for her &#145;sole and separate use and benefit, exclusively of any husband&#146; and not &#145;subject to the debts, control, power, inter-meddling, or engagements of any such husband&#146;. Lady Bute, another of Coutts's daughters, was dead, but there was no mention of her children, or of the third daughter, Lady Guilford, or her children.<br>
<br>Harriot left lump sums and small annuities to a long list of friends and servants, but the residue of the estate, some &pound;1.8 million, she left in trust for the youngest granddaughter of Thomas Coutts, Angela Georgina Burdett [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32175/', "Coutts, Angela Burdett-")</script>]. The trustees of the estate were Harriot's partners at the bank, her solicitor, and the accountant-general of the high court of chancery. Harriot did not leave Angela the partnership in the bank, nor could she, her parents, or any future husband touch the capital. Angela was given complete control over the income of the estate, whether or not she married. The will also laid down that, if Angela should marry an alien, the fortune would go to the next person in remainder. Extraordinarily, Angela fell foul of this clause when she was sixty-seven and married her 26-year-old American-born secretary, William Ashmead Bartlett. The will also required that she take the surname Coutts, and it was under this name that Harriot's heir became known as the greatest of Victorian philanthropists. Harriot never explained her choice of heir, but Angela had been a favourite from childhood, and, unlike her siblings and cousins, had not offended Harriot with aristocratic pretensions.<br>
<br>For her great fortune, Angela Burdett-Coutts was indebted solely to her stepgrandmother, though she herself always maintained that the money came directly from her grandfather. Thus it was Harriot Mellon, the darling of the frivolous Georgian stage, who became, against all the odds, fairy godmother to the Victorian poor.<br>
