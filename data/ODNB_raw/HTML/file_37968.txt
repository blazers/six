<span class="headword">Sisley,  Alfred</span>  (1839&#150;1899), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born at 19 rue des Trois Bornes in the 11th <i>arrondissement</i> of Paris on 30 October 1839, into a family of Anglo-French descent, the younger son and second of four children of William Sisley (1799&#150;1879), a dealer in imported luxury goods, and his wife and cousin, Felicia Sell (1808&#150;1866), daughter of a saddler from Lydd, Kent. He was educated in Paris. Sisley retained the British nationality inherited from his parents, although he made two unsuccessful attempts in 1889 and 1898 to become a naturalized French citizen. He lived in France all his life and, apart from three years spent in London (1857&#150;60) studying commerce, when he may have become aware of the work of Constable, only visited Britain for short painting expeditions on three other occasions in 1874 (July&#150;October), 1881 (June) and 1897 (July&#150;September). On the first of these brief visits Sisley explored the River Thames, painting for example <span class="italic">Bridge at Hampton Court</span> (Wallraf Richartz Museum, Cologne) and <span class="italic">Molesey Weir&#151;Morning</span> (NG Scot.).<br>
<br>From <i>c</i>.1860 to 1863 he attended the atelier of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre in Paris. He then moved out of Paris and lived in villages near the River Seine to the west of the capital&#151;Louveciennes, Marly-le-Roi, and S&egrave;vres&#151;but in 1880 he returned to the area south-east of the forest of Fontainebleau, where he had first painted during the 1860s, and subsequently lived in a series of villages near the confluence of the rivers Loing and Seine&#151;Veneux-Nadon, Les Sablons, and Moret-sur-Loing. These movements are significant for an understanding of Sisley's work.<br>
<br>Sisley was an impressionist painter and exhibited in five of the eight impressionist exhibitions held at irregular intervals between 1874 and 1886. During the 1890s he occasionally exhibited with Les Vingt in Brussels and more regularly with the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Neither during his lifetime nor since have Sisley's paintings achieved the popularity of those by Monet, Renoir, or even Camille Pissarro, with all of whom he helped to develop the impressionist style. Consequently, he experienced considerable financial hardship which was exacerbated towards the end of his life by illness. For sales he relied upon dealers in Paris such as Paul Durand-Ruel, Georges Petit, and Goupil Boussod-Valadon, as well as upon a small group of patrons such as Fran&ccedil;ois Depeaux of Rouen, Henri Vever, and Edmond Decap, but financial success eluded him. On the other hand, certain young critics, especially Adolphe Tavernier (1853&#150;1945), did extol the virtues of Sisley's work. Tavernier remains one of the principal sources for our appreciation of Sisley's style and technique.<br>
<br>Sisley was principally a landscape painter and there are very few still lifes or portraits in an <i>&#339;uvre</i> that amounts to some 900 pictures. Drawings and prints by his hand are limited in number, although he was an able practitioner in pastel, which he began to use during the 1880s. Several of Sisley's early paintings dating from the second half of the 1860s were accepted for display in the official Salon, but during the 1870s he began to paint in a fully fledged impressionist style characterized by pure colours applied with broken brush strokes and intense light. Several of his finest works date from these years. Like many of the impressionists, Sisley experienced stylistic difficulties towards the end of the 1870s, but he remained faithful to the technique of impressionism. His mature landscapes are notable for the broad, low horizons, expansive skies, fugitive effects of light, vibrant colours (blue, violet, yellow, red), and rhythmical brushwork. Sisley often painted motifs in series, notably the church at Moret-sur-Loing in 1893 and 1894, inspired by Monet's views of the fa&ccedil;ade of Rouen Cathedral. During the last two decades of his life Sisley remained independent, although not unaware, of developments in Paris. His work retained a pronounced individuality and originality that has perhaps yet to be properly acknowledged.<br>
<br>During the early 1860s Sisley met (Marie Louise Ad&eacute;laide) Eug&eacute;nie Lescouezec (1834&#150;1898), with whom he had one son, Pierre (<i>b</i>. 1867), and one daughter, Jeanne (<i>b</i>. 1869). The couple were not formally married, however, until 5 August 1897 in Cardiff. Sisley died of cancer of the throat at his home, 19 rue Montmartre, Moret-sur-Loing, on 29 January 1899, his wife having predeceased him in October 1898. He was buried in Moret-sur-Loing cemetery on 1 February 1899.<br>
