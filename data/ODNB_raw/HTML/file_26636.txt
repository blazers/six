<span class="headword">Strange,  John</span>  (1732&#150;1799), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and diplomat</span>, was born in Barnet, Middlesex, and baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 10 March 1732, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26635/', "Sir John Strange (bap. 1696, d. 1754)")</script>, master of the rolls, and his wife, Susan Strong (1700/01&#150;1747), the eldest daughter of Edward Strong of Greenwich. He was educated privately and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1753 and proceeded MA in 1755. Following his father's death in 1754 he supervised the publishing of his <span class="italic">Reports of Adjudged Cases</span> (1755). On inheriting considerable wealth, he travelled extensively in the south of France, the Tyrol, and Italy. He lived near Pisa for much of the time between 1757 and 1764 and entered the circle of Tuscan antiquaries and men of science. His relationship with the physician and natural historian Tozzetti in particular &#145;certainly had a role in deepening and strengthening his interest in geology and palaeontology&#146;  (Ciancio, 125). Botany was a prime area of interest, strongly supplemented by the natural history of the earth, especially conchology, palaeontology, and physical geography, with particular emphasis on method in geology, linking observation, examination, and description with theory. He also stressed the invaluable use of maps and illustrations. He became a member of several learned institutions such as the Bologna Academy of Sciences, the Botanical Society of Florence, the Royal Academy of Montpellier, and the Academia Leopoldina Curiosorum Naturae of Leipzig. About 1760 Strange married Mary Ann Gould (<i>d</i>. 1783), daughter of Davidge Gould of Sharpham Park, near Street in Somerset, and Honora Hockman of Buckland Baron, Devon. Her brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11152/', "Sir Henry Gould (1710&#150;1794)")</script>. She died in Venice on 3 May 1783. They seemingly had no children.<br>
<br>For his contributions to geology Strange was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in April 1766; soon thereafter he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries for his contributions to archaeology. After spending the summer of 1768 in south Wales, he contributed &#145;An account of Roman remains in and near the city of Brecknock&#146; to the first number of <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1770). In 1771 he made an archaeological tour in northern Italy. As a result of meeting Abb&eacute; Fortis in Padua, he made several communications to the Society of Antiquaries on the Roman inscriptions and antiquities of Dalmatia and Istria, a region then little known in western Europe. In addition to further communications to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, he contributed several papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society, including accounts of &#145;The origin of natural paper found near Cortona in Tuscany&#146;  (59, 1769), &#145;Some specimens of sponges from Italy&#146;  (60, 1770), which included plates made from his own drawings, &#145;A curious Giant's causeway &hellip; newly discovered in the Euganean hills, near Padua&#146;  (65, 1775), and &#145;The tides in the Adriatic&#146;  (67, 1777). Such papers earned him an international reputation among scientists and antiquarians. The first-cited &#145;was also valuable for the accurate observations on microscopy it contained. Favourable reactions appeared in many learned journals stressing the erudition and skills of its author&#146;  (Ciancio, 124). Strange was playing a key role in the promotion of intellectual relations between Britain and the continent, particularly Italy, and corresponded with notable men of science such as Arduino, Bonnet, Caldani, and von Haller. His surviving correspondence reveals him as an important intermediary, especially regarding natural history, and as someone who was additionally thereby breaking down barriers between social ranks. A number of his papers were also published in Italy (in <span class="italic">Opuscoli scelti sulle scienze</span>) and in Switzerland (in Weber's <span class="italic">Mineralogische Beschreibungen</span>). He also contributed to the formation of private antiquarian collections which had significance for Britain. In England between 1765 and 1771 he had also had the opportunity to meet famous foreign visitors to London; he participated in public lectures on conchology by Emanuel Mendes da Costa; and he made notable geological observations as he travelled through numerous counties.<br>
<br>In Italy from the spring of 1771 Strange spent a year in the Veneto studying extinct volcanoes. He undertook geological studies in Switzerland in spring 1772 and France in spring 1773. In November 1773, thanks largely to Lord Bute, for whom he had lately acted as an unofficial collector of Italian drawings and rare books, he was appointed British resident minister in Venice. In post from autumn 1774, his official duties left him with far less time to pursue his antiquarian interests. He therefore supervised local naturalists, who surveyed notable areas of the region, and he paid Abb&eacute; Fortis and Girolamo Festari to carry out research in geology in particular but also in other disciplines. And from 1779 Strange kept Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, informed of new developments in Italian science&#151;one letter in particular, of March 1783, gave fulsome details of learned periodicals edited in Italy since the start of the century. Through the 1780s Strange ensured that the best of Italian scientific literature reached London. In addition to patronizing local studies, and hosting weekly <i>conversazioni</i> at the residency, Strange also reported regularly to London on the difficult and ever changing local political scene.<br>
<br>Strange ceased to act as resident in August 1786, and left Venice, with a &#145;leave of absence&#146; from the king, in October. He settled at Ridge, near South Mimms in Hertfordshire. He did not officially resign his post until August 1789. About 1788 he was elected a member of the council of the Royal Society, but poor health prevented his regular participation in weekly evening meetings at Banks's house. He possibly returned to Italy to arrange the transportation of the valuable collections he had formed there&#151;of books, manuscripts and antiquities, and of pictures, especially by Venetian masters. He had also commissioned engravings of many pictures in his collection. In London he was apparently unable to raise much interest or money when he sought to sell some pictures, possibly to defray the costs of his expensive years in Venice.<br>
<br>In July 1793 Strange was made an honorary DCL at Oxford. He died at Ridge on 19 March 1799. By his will he directed that all his collections should be sold. The pictures were sold by private contract, the natural history cabinets by King, and the prints, drawings, busts, coins, medals, bronzes, and antiquities by Christies. There was published in 1800 <span class="italic">Fossils, remains of animals and vegetables, minerals, recent shells, &amp;c. catalogue of the &hellip; museum of &hellip; J. Strange</span>. The library, the catalogue of which (<span class="italic">Bibliotheca Strangeiana</span>) was compiled by Samuel Paterson and published in 1801, was sold by Leigh and Sotheby over a period of twenty-nine days in March&#150;April of that year.<br>
