<span class="headword">Hartley, Sir  William Pickles</span>  (1846&#150;1922), <span class="occ">jam manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 23 February 1846 at Colne, Lancashire, the only surviving child of John Hartley, a whitesmith, and his wife, Margaret Pickles. He attended a local British and Foreign School Society school, and then Colne grammar school for a year before leaving at fourteen. Prevented from training as a chemist, he threw his energies into developing his mother's grocery business. Within two years he was running the shop himself and had begun to hawk grocers' sundries round adjoining towns and villages. He soon controlled one of the largest wholesale enterprises in Lancashire.<br>
<br>In 1866 Hartley married Martha O'Connor, the youngest daughter of Henry Horsfield, grocer, of Colne. They had a son and eight daughters, one of whom died in infancy. He valued, but did not always follow, her common-sense advice, grounded on a thorough knowledge of grocery. He was led into manufacturing when a local grocer failed to fulfil a contract for supplying jam; having won the subsequent arbitration case, Hartley decided to take up jam making himself. In 1874 he opened a factory at Bootle, near Liverpool, almost bankrupting himself as for some years the cost of his borrowings exceeded profits. Then in 1885, after the factory had been enlarged twice and profits had reached &pound;18,000 a year, he registered William Hartley &amp; Sons Ltd with nominal capital of &pound;100,000.<br>
<br>In 1886 Hartley decided to move operations to Aintree, which was better served by the railway network. The high quality of his ingredients, the absence of preservatives, and the reasonable prices of his products secured him a substantial market in the north of England and the midlands. To supply the steadily growing demand further south, in 1901 he opened a factory at Southwark in London. The two works had a joint capacity of 1000 tons a week, with storage space for 5&#150;6 million jars.<br>
<br>Hartley, a Primitive Methodist, consistently applied Christian principles to business. In 1888 he built a model village at Aintree; the following year he introduced a profit-sharing scheme, the results each year being announced at a special ceremony, with music and speeches. He claimed that the wages he paid to women and girls&#151;four-fifths of the workforce&#151;were appreciably higher than those of his competitors; he also provided free medical treatment. He personally chose his managers and trained them, sending them on advanced chemistry courses at his own expense.<br>
<br>From 1877 onwards Hartley devoted a tenth of his income to philanthropy, later raised to one-third; his benefactions totalled nearly &pound;300,000. He preferred to donate part of any sum requested, so as to encourage others to give. He endowed a number of hospitals in Colne, Liverpool, and London, and financed departments at Liverpool and Manchester universities. Equally generous to Primitive Methodism, he supported an organization for building chapels, acted as treasurer of its missionary society, and converted the old Holborn Town Hall into its national headquarters. In 1906 the Manchester theological college for training Primitive Methodist ministers was renamed Hartley College, Manchester (later Hartley Victoria College, in recognition of his benefactions. He propagated his ideas in his only published work, <span class="italic">The Use of Wealth</span> (n.d.). Uniquely for a layman, he was elected president of the Primitive Methodist conference in 1909.<br>
<br>Hartley was apt to undertake himself tasks which others could have done equally effectively. Until more scientific methods were introduced, after each boiling at the Aintree factory he used his delicacy of touch on the paper covers to test the consistency of selected samples. Likewise, he is said personally to have scrutinized each employee's work record annually, together with the head of department, to fix the profit-sharing bonus. His public services were thus necessarily limited. In 1893 he became JP for Lancashire, and he served as a Liberal on Liverpool city council from 1895 to 1898. He was also vice-president of the British Temperance League. Appropriately, he gave his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as &#145;none except driving&#146;.<br>
<br>Knighted in 1908, Hartley was one of those who were consulted on financial policy in the opening days of the First World War by the chancellor of the exchequer, Lloyd George. Hartley generously supported war charities, but chafed at the official demands and restrictions during the conflict. As the post-war years brought further problems to the company, he suffered increasing attacks of angina, from which he died at his home, Horsfield Cottage, 11 Oxford Road, Birkdale, Lancashire, on 25 October 1922. He was buried at Trawden, near Colne. His wife survived him.<br>
