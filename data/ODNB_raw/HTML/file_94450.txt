<span class="headword">Littlebury,  Martin  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1274), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was perhaps a younger son of the John of Littlebury who held lands by knight service of the bishop of Ely at Littlebury in Essex and Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, and who died in or before 1234, and of his wife, Margery. He seems to have had at least two brothers, John and Ralph, and possibly a third named Saer. The younger John was perhaps the John of Littlebury who had succeeded his father by 1234. Martin's first known appearance in official records is in an enrolment from the Kent eyre of 1241. His brother Ralph, who had been engaged in land litigation in the county, is recorded as entrusting the lands he held at Hastingleigh and Wingmere in east Kent (and perhaps elsewhere) in right of his late wife to Martin to hold as trustee for Ralph's children, Martin's nephew and niece, until they came of age. This Ralph is probably the Ralph of Littlebury who appears with his brother John as witness to a charter of Martin's of 1252 which established a chantry at Wisbech and endowed it with 50 acres of land there.<br>
<br>Martin of Littlebury is first described in official records as a king's clerk in 1242. He had probably already been in the king's service for some time by that date, for in 1242 the king presented him to a moiety of the Lancashire church of Blackburn, and it was probably his service to the king that also secured a papal indulgence for him in February 1245, allowing him to hold an additional benefice with cure of souls. It is not, however, entirely clear what service he had been rendering the king. He may have been a clerk of chancery, like the other royal clerk given an indulgence at the same time, Robert of Shottenden. More probably he was a clerk in the service of one or more of the king's justices. By 1245 he had been presented to the Cumberland church of Kirkoswald by Thomas of Moulton, either the royal justice of that name (<i>d</i>. 1240) or his son, perhaps as a reward for clerical service to Thomas in the common bench and on eyre. By 1250 he had also become a canon of Salisbury Cathedral. The bishop of Salisbury who collated him to the prebend of Stratton was almost certainly William of York (<i>d</i>. 1256), who before his election in 1246 had been a senior justice of the common bench and had also been the senior justice of the Kent eyre of 1241.<br>
<br>Martin of Littlebury served occasionally as an assize justice in the late 1240s, but his real service as a royal justice did not begin until the 1260s. He served as a junior justice on the three eyres of the circuit led by Gilbert of Preston in the first half of 1261, and after the eyres resumed in 1262 became senior justice on a separate circuit of his own. His final eyre was one held in Lincolnshire in the summer of 1263, which was never completed because of the outbreak of civil war. He did not serve as a justice during the period of Montfortian rule after the battle of Lewes in 1264, nor again until appointed chief justice of the common bench in Hilary term 1268. Chronicle evidence indicates that his was one of the voices of moderation after the Montfortian defeat at Evesham in 1265, urging on the king the need to make proper provision both for the widows of those who had fallen in rebellion against him, and for the wives of his living opponents who had been disinherited. It is possible that he played some part in the drafting of the <span class="roman">Statute of Marlborough</span>, enacted in November 1267, which gave permanent force to the provisions of Westminster, one of the major achievements of the &#145;period of baronial reform&#146;, and added some further clauses. Littlebury served as chief justice of the common bench until the end of Michaelmas term 1272 and thus to the end of Henry III's reign. He appears in some of the earliest surviving law reports, but they give little impression of his conduct as a justice. With the beginning of the new reign he was transferred to the court of king's bench and became its senior justice. He served for less than two years, dying some time between 28 June 1274, when he received his final judicial commission, and 23 September of the same year, when a successor was collated to the prebend he had held at Exeter Cathedral.<br>
