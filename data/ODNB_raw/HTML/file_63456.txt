<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mboya, Thomas Joseph</span>  (1930&#150;1969), <span class="occ">labour leader and politician in Kenya</span>, was born at Kilima Mbogo, near Thika, north of Nairobi, on 15 August 1930, the eldest of the six children of Leunadus Ndiege, a sisal worker from Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, and his wife Marsella Awuor. Mboya's parents were Suba Luo by ethnic identity and Roman Catholic by religious conversion. Mboya was baptized a Catholic, and between the ages of seven and seventeen attended Irish-run Catholic schools in Kikuyu, Kamba, and Luo districts. By his own account, his non-tribal outlook in later life owed much to his unusually travelled childhood.<br>
<br>Mboya spent the years 1948&#150;50 at the Jeanes School, Kabete, where he studied sanitation and was president of the student council. In 1951 he began work with the Nairobi city council as a sanitary inspector. Politicized, confident, and ambitious, he plunged into labour organization. Despite his employers' resistance he converted the African Municipal Workers' Staff Association into the Kenya Local Government Workers' Union, with himself as secretary. In October 1952, immediately following the declaration of the Mau Mau emergency, he defiantly joined the Kenya African Union, the main nationalist party, and in the absence of its incarcerated leadership served as director of information and then as treasurer until the party's proscription in June 1953. Two months later he quit his city council job and in September took his union into the fledgeling Kenya Federation of Registered Trade Unions, becoming general secretary of the federation shortly afterwards. He would hold this post for almost a decade. During the early years of the emergency, when political activity by Africans was banned, Mboya used the federation (renamed Kenya Federation of Labour in 1955) as a vehicle for social, economic, and political protest. His co-operation with the government on labour matters helped him to survive unarrested. So too perhaps did the support he was garnering abroad, notably from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. His achievement in settling the Mombasa Dock strike of March 1955 confirmed both his dominance in labour affairs and his extraordinary political skills.<br>
<br>In 1955&#150;6, armed with a scholarship provided by the Trades Union Congress and the Colonial Office, Mboya studied at Ruskin College, Oxford. He went on to make a speaking tour of the United States, where he established ties with various businessmen, politicians, and labour leaders. These American connections bore much subsequent fruit; his student airlift scheme of 1959&#150;61, for example, was partly funded by the Kennedy Foundation. In March 1957 he won the seat of Nairobi in the first African elections to the legislative council. With Kenyatta and other Kikuyu leaders still in detention, Mboya could use his position in Legco to assume <i>de facto</i> leadership of the nationalist movement. The British authorities sought a multiracial dispensation for Kenya. By contrast, Mboya's agenda was to break settler power and press for majority rule. Blending lawyerly finesse with implacable non-co-operation, he extracted a series of concessions from the government. He also joined forces with his political rival Oginga Odinga in campaigning for Kenyatta's release. On the wider African stage, he chaired the historic All-African Peoples' Conference in Accra in 1958.<br>
<br>Mboya was a key participant at the 1960 Lancaster House conference at which the principle of majority rule for Kenya was conceded. Nationwide parties were then established: the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). Mboya mobilized the alliances he had created between his Nairobi People's Convention Party and political associations in other districts in order to secure the general secretaryship of KANU, thus maintaining a position of organizational power even after the return of the detainees. Mboya was strong-willed, single-minded, and acutely intelligent. In appearance he was distinctively round-faced. He married twice: his first, short-lived, marriage in the early 1950s to Ogweni was contracted under Luo custom, his second, to Pamela Odede (<i>b</i>. 1939) on 20 January 1962, within the church. From the first marriage there was a daughter, from the second two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In April 1962 Mboya entered government, serving in the KANU&#150;KADU coalition of 1962&#150;3 as minister of labour. After the election of June 1963, which was followed by independence in December, KANU ruled alone under Kenyatta's leadership, with Mboya holding the portfolios of justice and constitutional affairs (June 1963 to December 1964) and economic planning and development (December 1964 to July 1969). In the former portfolio he engineered Kenya's presidential constitution; in the latter he was an orthodox developmentalist of his time, relying on state planning and foreign investment to stimulate growth. He was also indispensable to Kenyatta as a tactician, first in marginalizing KADU, later in forcing Odinga's radical faction out of KANU, tasks accomplished by 1966.<br>
<br>Tom Mboya's talents, achievements and sophistication won him fame abroad, his rapport with the common people, popularity at home. Within KANU, however, he had enemies; men who had been outmanoeuvred by him politically and resented his arrogance towards them. The ethnic variable was probably relevant; by the later 1960s he was the only Luo in the higher reaches of a Kikuyu-dominated government. He was assassinated by gunshot in Government Road, Nairobi on 5 July 1969, dying on the way to hospital. His death precipitated widespread civil strife, including anti-Kikuyu riots by Luo crowds. On 11 July he was buried on Rusinga island, Nyanza. A Kikuyu suspect was arrested, tried, convicted, and executed. Rumour had it that the assassin had been hired by one or more of Mboya's political antagonists, intent, perhaps, on ensuring that he would never succeed to the presidency.<br>
