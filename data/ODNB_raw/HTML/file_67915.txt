<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dixon,  Reginald Herbert</span>  (1904&#150;1985), <span class="occ">theatre organist</span>, was born on 16 October 1904 at 18 Bowness Road, Eccleshill, Sheffield, the youngest of three children of Richard Dixon and his wife, Alice Helena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. His father was employed as a filecutter in the Sheffield steel industry and the unpredictability of his work meant that, after an elementary education at the city's central secondary school, Reginald's musical talent was diverted from his ambition to be a concert pianist into more immediately gainful employment. From fourteen he was employed as a church organist and also gave piano lessons before he obtained a post as a pianist accompanying silent films at Stocksbridge Palace cinema, Sheffield, where he was paid &pound;3 per week. The manager of the cinema was particularly impressed by Dixon and pleaded on his behalf for a new piano when the old one succumbed to the wear and tear of the young pianist slamming down its lid to imitate gunfire and kicking the exposed strings to accompany stampeding horses.<br>
<br>When the owners denied the request Dixon moved on to a better-paid position in Chesterfield. There followed a series of jobs in cinemas, progressing from the piano to the cinema organ, and from deputy to principal posts before a move in 1929 to the New Victoria cinema in Preston, Lancashire, on the higher salary of 8 guineas a week. This appointment required him to move further away from his teenage sweetheart, (Ethel) Vera Fidler (1907&#150;1975), the 21-year-old daughter of Frederick Fidler, GPO civil servant, to whom he now proposed at the same location that his father had proposed to his mother, the balcony of the Tower Ballroom, Blackpool. The couple were married at Preston register office on 10 July 1929 and later had two daughters, Jacqueline and Angela.<br>
<br>Dixon's new place of work, the New Victoria, was equipped with a two-manual (keyboard) Wurlitzer organ and it was on this instrument that the Tower Company manager, Harry Hall, heard Dixon play and invited him to audition at the Tower Ballroom, Blackpool. The Tower's Wurlitzer had been installed in 1929, the first in a ballroom in the United Kingdom, but had not proved a success, being difficult to play and unpopular with dancers. After a successful audition Dixon was told that both he and the Wurlitzer had one summer season to prove themselves&#151;failure would have meant the removal of the organ from the ballroom. Dixon was daunted by the task, having been paid off early from a previous spell playing for dancers in a Sheffield restaurant years before. It was, none the less, a brief experience that allowed him to answer positively, and truthfully, when asked if he had ever before played as an accompaniment for dancing. With the release of <span class="italic">The Jazz Singer</span> in 1927, and the subsequent conversion of cinemas to show the new talking pictures, it was apparent to Dixon that his days as a cinema organist were numbered, and that the Tower job offered him a real alternative.<br>
<br>In his new position Dixon was helped by the resident bandleader, Bertini 
    (Bert Gutsell, 1896&#150;1957)
  , who encouraged him to develop a style in which the organist made full use of the instrument's manuals and pedal board to emphasize the rhythm of the music, enabling dancers at the back of the crowded ballroom dance floor to hear the beat. This evolved into a characteristic style known as the Blackpool sound. The bright, bouncy quality of the music appealed to dancers in the ballroom and also to radio listeners, for whom Dixon first performed in 1930, quickly becoming a popular and prolific broadcaster. Dixon's signature tune &#145;I Do Like to be Beside the Seaside&#146; (composed in 1909 by John A. Glover-Kind) was played each time he performed on the radio and became indelibly associated with the organist, the Tower Wurlitzer, and with Blackpool. Dixon's success in the ballroom meant that he was able to persuade the Tower Company to replace the Wurlitzer with a more powerful version, so that all of the dancers could hear the music on a large dance floor measuring 120 feet square. The new instrument, known as the Wonder Wurlitzer, was installed to Dixon's specifications in 1935 and remains in regular use in the early twenty-first century.<br>
<br>When Reginald Foort (1893&#150;1980) resigned as the BBC's staff organist in 1938 Dixon topped a <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> poll to replace him. Both Dixon and the Tower Company denied that he had been offered the appointment, though at the same time his weekly salary was increased from &pound;15 2<i>s</i>. (already making him the highest paid musician at the Tower Company) to &pound;30.<br>
<br>Reginald Dixon's forty years as organist at the Tower Ballroom were interrupted only during the Second World War, when he served as a musician in the RAF and rose to the rank of squadron leader, and from December 1956 when the ballroom was badly damaged by fire. In 1966 he was appointed MBE for services to music and remained at the Tower for a further four years. Following his retirement he continued to live at 3 Orchard Avenue, Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, and also to tour until 1981, when he was in poor health and his final recording was released. He died of bronchopneumonia on 9 May 1985 at the Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, an institution for which he had been an enthusiastic fund-raiser throughout his career. He was cremated at the town's Carleton crematorium.<br>
<br>Reginald Dixon is remembered as Mr Blackpool&#151;a quietly spoken, modest Yorkshireman, whose flamboyant musical style endeared him to millions of radio listeners the world over, for whom he gave more than 2000 broadcast performances. His adopted home of Blackpool was advertised to an international audience through the distinctive sound of Dixon at the keyboard. In 1956 the resort rewarded him with its highest accolade, an invitation to switch on the autumn illuminations. Today his signature tune endures as Blackpool's soundtrack.<br>
