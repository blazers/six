<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ballance,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1893), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and premier of New Zealand</span>, was born on 27 March 1839 at Ballypitmave, near Glenavy, co. Antrim, Ireland, the eldest of the eleven children of Samuel Ballance (1800&#150;1879), a tenant farmer, and his wife, Mary McNiece, the daughter of Conway McNiece. He was educated at the local national school and Wilson's academy in Belfast. By the age of sixteen he was helping his father, an evangelical protestant who was active in local politics, to write his speeches. He left school early and took a job with a Belfast hardware firm. In 1857 he left Belfast for Birmingham to work as a travelling salesman, and enrolled in evening classes at the Birmingham and Midland Institute to study politics, biography, and history. He married Fanny Taylor, the daughter of a licensed victualler, at the church of St Peter and St Paul, Aston, on 17 June 1863. Not long afterwards, owing in part to Fanny's ill health, they decided to emigrate to New Zealand, where Fanny had a brother living in Wanganui. In April 1866 they left London on the <i>Ruahine</i> bound for Melbourne, and after a short stay continued to New Zealand on the <i>Albion</i>. They arrived at Wellington on 11 August, and a few days later travelled to Wanganui.<br>
<br>In Wanganui, Ballance opened a jewellery store as a temporary expedient, but it did not prosper. In 1867 he established the <span class="italic">Evening Herald</span> (later the <span class="italic">Wanganui Herald</span>) and its weekly edition, the <span class="italic">Weekly Herald</span> (later <span class="italic">The Yeoman</span>). An able and innovative journalist, he ran the paper with considerable success. During the war against Titokowaru in 1868&#150;9, when Wanganui felt itself under immediate threat, the <span class="italic">Herald</span> was outspoken in criticizing the performance of the British forces and Titokowaru. Regarded by the authorities as a maverick troublemaker, Ballance spent a night in gaol after refusing to join the local militia, the compulsion having offended his liberal beliefs. However, he later saw limited action with the Wanganui cavalry volunteers, when he combined the roles of soldier and war correspondent. In March 1868 Fanny Ballance died, at the age of twenty-four. On 19 May 1870, in Wellington, Ballance married Ellen Anderson, the daughter of the Wellington merchant David Anderson and his wife, Ann Thompson. There were no children from either marriage, but in 1886 Ellen and John adopted Ellen's four-year-old niece.<br>
<br>Increasingly involved in Wanganui affairs, Ballance in 1875 narrowly won the Rangitikei parliamentary seat on a platform stressing abolition of the provincial system and support for state education. He joined George Grey's ministry in January 1878 as commissioner of customs, commissioner of stamp duties, and minister of education. Shortly afterwards he became colonial treasurer&#151;high office for a politically inexperienced man. His budget of 6 August 1878 was arguably the most significant since Julius Vogel's public works announcement eight years earlier; he reformed the tariff and introduced a modest but symbolically important land tax. Ballance won the Wanganui seat in 1879 but two years later suffered his only electoral defeat. Out of parliament he continued to advocate closer land settlement, writing a series of articles (collected in 1887 as <span class="italic">A National Land Policy Based on the Principle of State Ownership</span>) on land reform and nationalization. A convinced secularist, he formed the Wanganui Freethought Association in 1883 and brought out the monthly <span class="italic">Freethought Review</span> (1883&#150;5).<br>
<br>Returned at the 1884 general election by a sizable majority, Ballance joined the Stout&#150;Vogel ministry and held the lands and immigration, native affairs, and defence portfolios. His important <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1885 aimed to place as many people as possible on the land by encouraging leasehold tenure and establishing government-assisted special settlement schemes. As native minister he pursued an enlightened, if somewhat paternalistic, policy aimed at protecting Maori land from private sale. The government was defeated in 1887, and two years later Ballance was elected leader of the opposition. A radical land policy was the dominant theme of his campaign at the December 1890 election, which took place against a background of strikes and economic depression. Liberals and their trade unions fared well at the polls, and in January 1891 Ballance formed the country's first Liberal government.<br>
<br>Having surrounded himself with talented cabinet colleagues, Ballance steered his government through two difficult years before his death in 1893, and in doing so laid the foundation for a long period of Liberal rule. A major problem was opposition to his legislation from the legislative council. The defeated premier, Harry Atkinson, had arranged for the appointment of seven councillors in an attempt to block the new government. The council subsequently rejected key measures passed in the lower house. Ballance failed to persuade the governor to redress Atkinson's actions by appointing Ballance nominees. The matter was passed to the Colonial Office in London, which in 1892 ruled in Ballance's favour, thus securing the passage of Liberal legislation and marking a major step in New Zealand's path to independence.<br>
<br>During his premiership Ballance established the Liberal Federation, the first attempt in New Zealand to form a nationwide party organization. As colonial treasurer he introduced land and income taxes to replace the property tax. Other legislation included the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> 1892 and the <span class="roman">Land for Settlements Act</span> 1892. The new taxes were much criticized at home and overseas, but critics were largely silenced when Ballance announced a record budget surplus in 1892. In his last months in office he supported moves to enfranchise women, a reform he had long advocated. In this he was strongly influenced by his wife, Ellen, who was prominent in the growing feminist movement in New Zealand and vice-president of the Women's Progressive Society.<br>
<br>Ballance was not charismatic, nor was he a great public speaker. He was kind, courteous, considerate, and honest, and attracted extraordinary loyalty among his cabinet. Many viewed his mild temperament as a sign of weakness. W. P. Reeves described him as &#145;absolutely the most unassuming and unpretentious&#146; of all the successful men he had known. But, he added, &#145;as a Premier&#151;and I say it emphatically&#151;he knew how to be master in his own house&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Yeoman</span>, 10 June 1893).<br>
<br>Ballance died of cancer at Premier House, Wellington, on 27 April 1893. After a state funeral he was buried at Wanganui three days later. Death in office helped serve his positive popular reputation, although over the following long premiership of Richard Seddon, Ballance's major contribution to Liberalism tended to disappear from view. Ellen Ballance survived her husband and remained active in community organizations in Wanganui, where she died on 14 June 1935.<br>
