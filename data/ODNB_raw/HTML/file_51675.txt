<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Saker,  Edward Sloman</span>  (1838&#150;1883), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born at 4 Waterloo Terrace, Bethnal Green, London, on 30 September 1838, one of several children of William Saker (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;1849), a low comedian popular in London's minor theatres and later a tobacconist and news-vendor, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanbry. Having initially been articled to an architect, in 1857 he joined his elder sister and brother-in-law, Rosina Tyler and Robert H. Wyndham, at Edinburgh, where the latter had the lease of the Queen's Theatre and where Saker made lasting friendships with Henry Irving and Edward Sothern. His stage d&eacute;but, when he was twenty, was in the burlesque <span class="italic">Medea</span>. His first taste of management came when he undertook a three-week after-season at the Queen's in 1862. He harnessed the strength of the existing stock company and opened on 7 June with a triple bill including <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>. Among a remarkable range of productions, some starring the Irish comedian Gardiner Coyne, the highlight was the burlesque <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>, advertised as &#145;klever, kuth, kean, komical, kwick, krotesque&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span>, 25 June 1862), in which Saker played Helen.<br>
<br>Saker went to Liverpool in 1864 as the principal low comedian at the Prince of Wales Theatre under the management of Alexander Henderson, to whom he had been recommended by Sothern. He achieved particular success there in F. C. Burnand's <span class="italic">Paris</span>, as Castor to the Pollux of Lionel Brough and with Henry Irving as Oenone. During a summer break the following year he went to Paris with Sothern to play in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span> at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Italiens.<br>
<br>In late 1868 Saker took over the lease of Liverpool's Alexandra Theatre in Lime Street, perhaps mistakenly &#145;built by the genteel for the genteel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Courier</span>, 30 March 1883), where the two previous managers (one of them H. J. Byron) had failed, and where the pit had, unusually, been built above the stalls, which covered the whole ground floor, and there was an excess of boxes. In order to court a popular crowd at least as much as a more &eacute;lite audience, Saker had the theatre adapted, reducing the stalls, creating a more conventional pit to seat 250, and providing an additional &#145;shilling&#146; pit. He opened on 7 December with a stock company and his own production of <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, in which he played Touchstone, and a farce, <span class="italic">His Last Legs</span>, in which the visiting Robert Wyndham starred.<br>
<br>In his years at the Alexandra, Saker provided a mixture of in-house productions, some of which were written specially for him, and shows by the leading companies on tour, including those of Charles Calvert (in which the young A. W. Pinero appeared), and Mrs John Wood. The theatre ranked &#145;as one of the city's cultural institutions comparable to the newly-built art gallery or the library&#146; at a time when &#145;energetic cultivation of civic pride&#146; was as necessary for a lessee as skilful house management and publicity  (Jackson, 100&#150;09). Especially notable were his pantomimes and, influenced by the productions of Charles Kean and Charles Calvert, his spectacular revivals of Shakespeare's plays. He rarely presented opera, evidently recognizing that this would not be to the taste of his more regular patrons.<br>
<br>On 16 February 1874 Saker married an actress whose stage name was Marie O'Berne (or O'Beirne). <a name="cosubject_51675"></a><span class="headword">Emily Mary Kate Saker</span>  (1847&#150;1912) was the daughter of John O'Brien, a printer, and became a comedian who could hold an &#145;irresistible sway over the gods and the elite&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 10 Feb 1912). After appearing in pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Hull, making her London d&eacute;but at the Court Theatre, and playing in May 1871 in H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">Daisy Farm</span> at the Olympic Theatre, she had joined Saker's Liverpool stock company in 1872. The pair appeared at the Alexandra for the first time after their marriage in Thomas Morton's farce <span class="italic">A Roland for an Oliver</span> on 2 March 1874. The couple, who &#145;had the entry to the best social circles in Liverpool&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 31 March 1883), had four sons and a daughter and were able to maintain a household staff of five, including a governess. A freemason and one of the founders of the Liverpool Dramatic Lodge, Saker otherwise preferred home life to any more &#145;promiscuous social intercourse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Review</span>, 7 April 1883).<br>
<br>Described as an &#145;eccentric comedian&#146;, Saker was held to display a &#145;wonderful agility&#146; in &#145;grotesque dances&#146; and to have an inimitable power &#145;of mock conjuring and striking caricature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 31 March 1883). Productions of original works were given &#145;as much care and completeness as a London manager would bestow on a piece anticipated for a long run&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Review</span>, 7 April 1883).<br>
<br>Saker died at his home, 118 Bedford Street, Liverpool, on 29 March 1883 and was buried on 2 April in St James cemetery, Liverpool. His widow continued to run the Alexandra, albeit with a greater proportion of touring companies and less financial success than her husband, until April 1888, when Julia Neilson made her first appearance in Liverpool at her farewell benefit as Galatea in a production of <span class="italic">Pygmalion and Galatea</span> supervised by W. S. Gilbert. Marie Saker then returned to the London stage and later toured with Sir George Alexander's company. She died in London on 6 February 1912 and was buried at Chiswick.<br>
<br>Edward Saker's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_24525"></a><span class="headword">Horatio Saker</span>  (1824&#150;1861), born in London on 27 May 1824, also gained experience with the Wyndhams at Edinburgh before he and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gamage (whom he had married on 29 October 1844), joined Charles Kean's company at the Princess's Theatre, London, in the early 1850s. They continued there under the management of Augustus Harris. Saker played a number of pantomime kings and such roles as Flute in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, Launcelot Gobbo in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Pistol in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, and appeared many times as one of the witches in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. He died at 23 Cardington Street, St Pancras, London, of smallpox on 3 April 1861.<br>
