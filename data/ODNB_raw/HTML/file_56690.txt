<span class="headword">Brown <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Solomon]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1847&#150;1935), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born at Sea Point, Cape Town, Cape Colony, on 20 July 1847, one of the eleven children of Henry Solomon (<i>b</i>. 1816), a Jewish convert to Christianity, and his wife, Julia Middleton, the daughter of a Yorkshire doctor. Henry Solomon's British-born parents had moved to the Cape, where their family became prominent and influential. Mary Brown's childhood was happy, with more freedom than was usual for girls of her time. In adult life she had striking features, with deep-set eyes and dark curly hair. She went to a small dame-school in Cape Town, and, showing great intellectual promise, joined the first classes for women at Cape Town University when she was seventeen.<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen Mary Solomon met Dr John Brown (1842&#150;1929), the son of a London Missionary Society missionary, the Revd J. C. Brown. He had been educated in Scotland, returning to South Africa in 1864 as a newly qualified doctor. His advanced views on freedom and the education of women attracted Mary. When they were engaged he sent her to Scotland on a six-month visit to his parents and to see London and Paris. They were married in Cape Town on 22 June 1869. Her husband was practising in Fraserburg, and after a short honeymoon at the Cape they travelled there by Cape-cart, a journey taking nearly a week.<br>
<br>It was an isolated life. John Brown had books sent out from England, including John Stuart Mill's <span class="italic">Liberty</span> and <span class="italic">The Subjection of Women</span>, and read aloud to his wife most evenings. A son was born in 1870, followed by a daughter, Rachel, in 1872, and another son, John, in 1874, who died in infancy. In 1876 John Brown gave up his practice and returned to Edinburgh with his family to study. Three years later they moved to Burnley in Lancashire, where Mary Brown began the social work for which she became well known. She was the first woman to be elected a poor-law guardian, and it was due to her that the cruel practice of separating elderly married couples when they entered the workhouse was ended. Seeing the trouble caused by alcohol she &#145;took the pledge&#146; and founded the Burnley branch of the Women's Temperance Movement.<br>
<br>A close friend in South Africa was Olive Schreiner; Mary Brown persuaded Chapman and Hall to publish <span class="italic">The Story of an African Farm</span> (1883), and the two women remained close until Schreiner's death in 1920. Mary Brown joined the Burnley Co-operative Society and became a leader of the Women's Co-operative Movement. She supported the Labour Party from its foundation, and she and her husband were staunch friends of Keir Hardie. An excellent public speaker, she was also a competent chair of meetings and committees.<br>
<br>Confirmed in the Anglican church in 1880, Mary Brown was deeply religious but never sectarian. Although she was in sympathy with the socialism of her day she could not always agree with its methods, putting her Christian faith first and politics second. During the great Burnley coal strike she organized soup kitchens for the men and their families. &#145;Moral and social hygiene&#146; engrossed her: she helped found a rescue home for girls, becoming its secretary and treasurer, and sometimes took desperate pregnant girls into her own home. When General Booth visited Burnley she added the Salvationists to the causes she supported. She joined in the fight for women's suffrage, though was never a militant.<br>
<br>When John Brown retired in 1898 he and his wife spent a year travelling in South Africa. She met President Kruger in Pretoria and President Steyn in Bloemfontein. The stupidity of the Jameson raid of 1895 had angered her and she was certain war was near. It broke out after their return to England: regarding it as an unnecessary war, she supported self-government for South Africa.<br>
<br>The Browns returned to South Africa in 1905 and spent the rest of their lives there. Although nearly sixty Mary entered the battle to bring social reform to her country. Elected a member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Cape Colony, in 1907 she became the superintendent of its department for social purity and moral education. After the Union of South Africa was created in 1910 this post led to her dealing with social welfare throughout South Africa, being particularly involved with work for the &#145;feeble minded&#146;. She also founded the first Mothers' Union in the Cape and worked for women's suffrage. She went to Johannesburg to help start a moral welfare campaign there and about 1908&#150;9 was involved in a parliamentary commission of inquiry into &#145;the Colour Question&#146;, which meant the prevention of venereal disease. In 1912 she led a deputation to the minister of justice demanding that the age of consent be raised to a uniform sixteen throughout the country. It was strongly opposed, but she was ultimately successful. With the help of a Jesuit priest she organized special meetings for men, and together they opened a &#145;home for rescuing girl children from evil surroundings&#146;.<br>
<br>Brown died on 8 May 1929. Mary Brown, in her last years, suffered badly from arthritis and was nearly blind. She died in her sleep on 16 January 1935 at her home, Avondrust, Rosebank, Cape Town.<br>
