<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morton,  Charles</span>  (1819&#150;1904), <span class="occ">music-hall and theatre manager</span>, was born in Hackney, Middlesex, on 15 August 1819. Little is known of his early life, but he was established as a publican by about 1840. In 1849 he acquired the Canterbury Arms in Upper Marsh, Lambeth, where he boosted custom by organizing concerts. In May 1852 he opened a custom-built concert hall on the skittle alley, to which admission was gained by a 6<i>d</i>. refreshment ticket, redeemable for drinks. The venture proved sufficiently popular for an improved hall to be opened in December 1854, at a reputed cost of &pound;40,000.<br>
<br>It was, above all, this early phase of Morton's career that eventually earned him the title &#145;Father of the Halls&#146;. Most modern students of music-hall history agree that this claim was in many ways undeserved. Morton's reputation owed much to his longevity and his popularity with certain key figures in the worlds of entertainment and journalism, and these factors combined to marginalize the achievements of others. Although his decision to build a &#145;music-hall&#146; that was physically separate from the public house was unusual, many publicans, in the provinces as well as London, were developing concert halls from the 1840s and 1850s and utilizing several of the practices once commonly seen as peculiar to the Canterbury. Nevertheless, Morton was a significant figure in the growth of the industry, above all as a skilled publicist at an important moment in its development. Particularly in the 1870s, he also made a substantial contribution to the development of musical theatre and light opera in London.<br>
<br>Arguably Morton's most distinctive contribution to the nascent industry can be seen in his attempt to develop a refined style of entertainment that helped to earn much needed respectability and publicity. More forcefully and effectively than most of his contemporaries, he stole the clothes of those potential enemies who sought to reform popular recreation by placing great emphasis on the moral and educational tone of certain elements of the Canterbury's programme. He employed a choir which performed operatic selections, glees, and madrigals; indeed, Gounod's <span class="italic">Faust</span>, or at least extracts from it, was given for the first time in Britain at the Canterbury in 1859. A small art gallery was established in an annexe in 1856, along with a small reading-room. In 1855 and 1856 Morton produced theatrical entertainments at the hall, although the fact that he did so without the necessary licence brought him into conflict with the local magistracy. Even then, the subsequent publicity helped to boost the hall's success even further. Morton thus foreshadowed much of the philosophy that underpinned the growth of the so-called variety industry from the late nineteenth century.<br>
<br>The music-hall industry had begun its colonization of London's West End in 1857 with the opening of Weston's Music Hall, and Morton followed this trend by opening the Oxford Music Hall in Oxford Street in March 1861. Significantly, the hall opened with a concert featuring Charles Santley, a leading young bass-baritone in the fields of oratorio and opera, and the operatic soprano Euphrosyne Parepa. Rather more typical fare followed this skilfully designed publicity stunt, with most leading music-hall performers of the period appearing at the Oxford. In the late 1860s the hall was strongly associated with the Great Vance, a leading comic singer. The Oxford burnt down in February 1868, an event which was to sever Morton's connection with the industry for some time. From 1868 to 1870 he was proprietor of the North Woolwich Gardens, which featured a combination of concerts, acrobatic entertainments, and ballet, but, partly as a result of poor weather, the venture failed. In 1870 he took over as part proprietor of the Philharmonic in Islington, where he began a new phase of his career as a promoter of light opera and musical theatre. His greatest success came with the production of Offenbach's <span class="italic">Genevi&egrave;ve de Brabant</span>, starring Emily Soldene, which opened in November 1871. A dispute with his business partner at the Philharmonic led to Morton's leaving the theatre in 1873 to spend the next four years in a number of short-term ventures, including a tour of the United States with the Soldene Opera Bouffe Company, one of the earliest light opera companies to tour America. The venture lost &pound;8000, and Morton spent the rest of his career in managerial positions as a result of his lack of capital. For most of the period between 1877 and 1890 Morton managed the Alhambra, first as a theatre and light opera house, later as a variety theatre. He was forcibly retired by the directors in 1890, and it was in a poem read at his farewell benefit concert that the journalist Clement Scott awarded him the sobriquet &#145;Father of the Halls&#146;. In 1891 Morton became manager of the Tivoli Music Hall, and he completed his career at the Palace. He retired on account of ill health in August 1904, and died at his home, 11 Oval Road, Regent's Park, on 18 October 1904.<br>
<br>Morton's private life is decidedly obscure. He was, at least in his old age, almost teetotal, a non-smoker, and a vegetarian. He was married twice&#151;his first wife died in the 1840s&#151;and his death left his second wife, Kate, in <span class="italic">The Era</span>'s words, &#145;very inadequately provided for&#146;. A benefit concert was held for her in November 1904. Morton also left at least one daughter, Olive Meads, who was present at his death.<br>
