<span class="headword">Holmes,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1711, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, fourth son of Henry Holmes, governor of the Isle of Wight, and his wife (and cousin), Mary, the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13600/', "Admiral Sir Robert Holmes")</script>, was baptized at Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on 19 September 1711. In 1727 he entered the <i>Captain</i> as an ordinary seaman. He was made lieutenant on 18 June 1734. Four years later he was serving in the <i>Sunderland</i>, and in 1740 in the <i>Pembroke</i>, one of the Mediterranean Fleet, under Nicholas Haddock. He then went to the West Indies as a lieutenant of the <i>Tilbury</i> and there moved into the <i>Princess Caroline</i>, Edward Vernon's flagship. On 24 February 1741 he was promoted to the command of the fireship <i>Stromboli</i>, and he served with the fleet in the expedition to Cartagena (March&#150;April 1741).<br>
<br>On 9 June 1741 Holmes was moved into the <i>Success</i>; he returned in her to England and was, on 20 February 1742, posted to the <i>Sapphire</i>, and employed during the next two years in cruising against Spanish privateers. In December 1743 he was moved into the <i>Cornwall</i>, and in the following June into the <i>Enterprise</i>, which he commanded for the next three years in the West Indies. In May 1747 he was transferred to the <i>Lennox</i> (70 guns) which, in September 1748, sailed from Jamaica in charge of the homeward trade. In the Gulf of Florida, on 29 September, they fell in with the Spanish squadron under Reggio, on which Holmes directed the convoy to make the best of their way while he went himself in the <i>Lennox</i> to give the news to Rear-Admiral Charles Knowles, whom he believed to be off Havana, and to reinforce him, in case of an action. On the following evening he fell in with Knowles, and at daylight on 1 October the Spanish squadron came in sight.<br>
<br>In the action that ensued the <i>Lennox</i>, by reason of her reduced armament, was stationed to windward of the line as a frigate. Knowles afterwards complained that several captains had been prone to error, and that Holmes especially had been guilty of disobedience and neglect of signals. From these events there came a series of courts martial, from which Holmes alone came out clear, the court not only acquitting him of the charges laid against him, but also passing a warm eulogium on his conduct and zeal in joining Knowles before the action.<br>
<br>In January 1753 Holmes was appointed to the <i>Anson</i>, guardship at Portsmouth, and in 1755 to the <i>Grafton</i>, one of the squadron sent out with Rear-Admiral Francis Holburne as a reinforcement to Edward Boscawen in North America. In the following year he was again on the coast of North America, this time with orders to prevent reinforcements from reaching Louisbourg. He arrived off Nova Scotia on 26 June, just after Richard Spry, who had wintered in Halifax harbour with several ships, was forced off the station owing to sickness in his crews. A month later Holmes failed to prevent four French ships under Louis-Joseph, Comte Beaussier de l'Isle, from entering Louisbourg harbour. An indecisive action lasting three hours was fought, when the French squadron came out, forcing Holmes to retreat to Halifax for repairs. Thereafter he confined his squadron to attacking defenceless French fishing craft and settlements in the Gulf of St Lawrence.<br>
<br>Holmes returned to England for the winter, and sat as a member of the court martial on Admiral John Byng, but in the summer of 1757 he was again in the <i>Grafton</i> on the North American station, and was with Holburne off Louisbourg when the fleet was shattered by the storm of 24 September. In addition to the loss of her masts the <i>Grafton</i> lost her rudder, and being obliged to bear away for England she fitted a jury rudder made of a spare topmast. Early in the following year Holmes in the small frigate <i>Seahorse</i>, in company with the <i>Stromboli</i>, was sent to the coast of Friesland, where the French and Austrians had taken possession of Emden with a force of 3000 men. On 18 March these two little vessels took up a position in the Ems that cut the enemy's communications. The French and Austrian forces at once decided that the place was no longer tenable, and evacuated it the next day.<br>
<br>On his return to England Holmes was appointed to the <i>Warspite</i> for a few months, and on 6 July he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue. The following year, with his flag in the <i>Dublin</i>, he was third in command of the fleet in the St Lawrence, under Sir Charles Saunders, in the expedition to capture Quebec. In August he commanded a small force which raided extensively and forced some of the French troops guarding the town to march after him. On 6 September General James Wolfe came aboard to reconnoitre the shore upriver from Quebec. When he selected the Anse au Foulon landing site it was Holmes's task to guarantee the army's safe landing, a task he described as &#145;the most hazardous and difficult task&#146; he had ever attempted. Late in September Holmes returned to England.<br>
<br>In March 1760 Holmes was appointed commander-in-chief at Jamaica. He arrived there in May, and during the next eighteen months seized all vessels leaving Monte Christi and the French ports of Hispaniola, major termini for American illegal trade. He died at Jamaica on 21 November 1761. There is a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey.<br>
