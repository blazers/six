<span class="headword">Williams,  William Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1771, <em>d.</em> 1841), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Richard Williams, a hop seller, and his wife, Alice, was baptized at Dursley in Gloucestershire on 2 April 1771. He was educated at Beverston Castle under Mr Hornidge and received his medical education at the Bristol Infirmary and in London at St Thomas's and Guy's hospitals. He became a surgeon to the East Norfolk militia, and served at home during the Napoleonic wars. In 1795, when the regiment was encamped near Deal Castle, he was appointed the senior of a number of surgeons responsible for the care of several hundred Russian sailors suffering from malignant fever and dysentery. About 1797 he designed a tourniquet of such simplicity and efficiency that it was quickly adopted by the military authorities and named &#145;Williams's field tourniquet&#146; by the army medical board in the printed directions for its use. This enthusiasm must in part be explained by the cheapness of the device: at 6<i>d</i>. it was much less than the 7<i>s</i>.&#150;12<i>s</i>. cost of the screw tourniquet then in use. It was ordered by the commander-in-chief, the duke of York, that Williams's tourniquet should be used in every regiment, and that all non-commissioned officers and musicians should be instructed in its use.<br>
<br>In 1798 Williams entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; he graduated MB (1803) and MD (1811). In 1801 he had settled at Brook Street, Ipswich, and in 1803 he became physician to the public dispensary, a post he retained until 1824. In 1810 Williams was appointed by Sir Lucas Pepys, physician-general of the army, as head of the South Military Hospital, near Ipswich, then filled with soldiers just returned from the battle of Walcheren, and suffering from fever, ague, and dysentery. On the completion of his service there he received a flattering letter from the army medical board. Williams was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1816 and a fellow on 30 September 1817. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society.<br>
<br>Williams was the author of a number of practical medical works, including <span class="italic">Hints on the Ventilation of Army Hospitals and on Regimental Practice</span> (1798). He continued to live at Ipswich, and died at Sandgate, Kent, where he had gone for health reasons, on 8 November 1841.<br>
