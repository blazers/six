<span class="headword">Agnew, Sir  James Willson</span>  (1815&#150;1901), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and politician in Tasmania</span>, born at Ballyclare, co. Antrim, Ireland, on 2 October 1815, was the son of James William Agnew, a physician, and Ellen Stewart, of Larne, co. Antrim. Educated for the medical profession at University College, London, at Paris, and at Glasgow, he qualified as MRCS in 1838 and graduated MD from Glasgow in 1839. That September he sailed for Sydney, Australia, on the <i>Wilmot</i>, arriving on 26 January 1840. He spent a few months practising in Sydney, and planned to take up land at Port Phillip, but accepted an invitation to become private secretary to Sir John Franklin, then governor of Van Diemen's Land. When he reached Hobart Town the post had been filled, but on 24 December 1841 he was appointed assistant surgeon on the agricultural establishment; in July 1842 he moved to Saltwater Creek on the Tasman peninsula as assistant surgeon. On 28 February 1845 he was transferred to be assistant surgeon (and later colonial surgeon) at Hobart Town, with charge of the general hospital. Concurrently he established a wide private practice, which laid the foundation of his influence among the people of Hobart Town. On 27 April 1846 he married Louisa Mary (<i>d</i>. 1868), the daughter of Major J. Fraser of the 78th highlanders. Of their six children, two sons and a daughter survived.<br>
<br>Agnew was one of the founders of the Tasmanian (Royal) Society, was elected to its council in 1851, and was honorary secretary from 1861 to 1881 and again from 1884 to 1894. He also served on the boards of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and the Hobart Public Library, as president of the racing club, and as chairman of the botanical garden.<br>
<br>In 1877 Agnew gave up his practice, and at the general election of July that year entered the legislative council as member for Hobart. He served in three short ministries led by P. O. Fysh, W. R. Giblin, and W. L. Crowther between August 1877 and February 1880, when he resigned in order to visit Melbourne and then England. His first wife had died on 10 March 1868, and on 19 November 1878 he married Blanche, the daughter of William Legge, of Tipperary, the widow of Revd Dr Parsons of Hobart Town; they had no children, and she died on 16 December 1891.<br>
<br>After returning from England in 1881, Agnew re-entered the legislative council in 1884. From 8 March 1886 to 29 March 1887 he was premier; he was also chief secretary until 1 March. His tenure of office was marked by educational reform, in which, as a member of the council of education and of the university, he was particularly interested. In 1891 he left the colony for a long visit to England; on his return to Tasmania in 1894 he was made KCMG. In 1899 he was disabled by illness, and he died at his home in Hobart Town on 8 November 1901. He was accorded a public funeral and buried at the Cornelian Bay cemetery, Hobart Town. Known as Good Doctor Agnew, he made material contributions to the cultural and social as well as the political life of Tasmania.<br>
