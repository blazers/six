<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Edmund Joseph</span>  (1811&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Jesuit and theologian</span>, was born in London on 30 April 1811. His mother was a daughter of Edmund O'Callaghan of Killegorey, co. Clare. In 1817 the family moved to Mount Catherine, near Limerick, where the father soon died, and after receiving private tuition O'Reilly was sent to the Jesuit school at Clongoweswood, near Kildare. He later studied metaphysics at Maynooth College, co. Kildare. About 1830 he entered the Irish College, Rome, where Paul Cullen (1803&#150;1878) (later archbishop of Dublin) was rector; they became lifelong friends. He graduated as a doctor in theology in 1835 and, after acting as assistant to Cullen, was ordained in 1838. Soon afterwards he returned to Ireland, where he was appointed professor of theology at Maynooth, a position which he held until 1850.<br>
<br>In August 1850 O'Reilly acted as theological adviser (at the Synod of Thurles) to Cullen, who had just been appointed archbishop of Armagh. He performed the same service for Bishop James Brown of Shrewsbury at the provincial synod of the English Catholic bishops held at Oscott, and for Bishop Furlong of Ferns at the Synod of Maynooth. In the summer of 1851 he applied for admission to the Society of Jesus; he undertook his noviciate at the Jesuit house in Naples, and during his time there published a revised <span class="italic">Catechism of Scripture History</span> (1852) which had been compiled by the Sisters of Mercy at Limerick. After completing his noviciate and taking his final vows he was appointed to teach theology at the Jesuit college of St Beuno's, near St Asaph, north Wales. His lectures there attracted attention, and in the summer of 1858 he was selected by J. H. Newman and the Irish bishops to teach divinity at the newly founded Catholic University in Dublin. Early in 1859 he was withdrawn from his university post and appointed superior of a new Jesuit retreat at Milltown Park, near Dublin, where he remained for the rest of his life. From 1863 to 1870 he was Irish provincial of the Society of Jesus.<br>
<br>Newman, in his <span class="italic">Letter to the Duke of Norfolk</span> during the Vatican controversy, mentioned O'Reilly as &#145;one of the first theologians of the day&#146;; and W. G. Ward, writing in the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span> in praise of his essays, regretted that he had published so little. O'Reilly's knowledge of patristic theology was especially extensive, and he was continually referred to by the Irish bishops and clergy as a high authority. Even in questions of civil law his opinion was thought to be of value. He was scrupulously truthful in controversy, and in private life he was well known for his courtesy and geniality.<br>
<br>In 1873&#150;4 O'Reilly contributed one essay to the <span class="italic">Illustrated Monitor</span>, and others to the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, and from 1875 he assisted Matthew Russell, the editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, to revise accepted articles. O'Reilly's essays, which included four on the question of papal infallibility, three on church legislation, and a number of others on papal obedience, the clergy, the temporal power, Catholic education, and the Council of Constance (in reply to W. E. Gladstone's <span class="italic">Vatican Decrees</span>), were posthumously published by Russell as <span class="italic">The Relations of the Church to Society</span> (1892). O'Reilly died at Milltown Park on 10 November 1878, in the same year as his friend, Cardinal Cullen, and was buried at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
