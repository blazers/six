<span class="headword">Watson, Sir  Alfred William</span>  (1870&#150;1936), <span class="occ">actuary and civil servant</span>, was born at 11 James Street, Bristol, on 11 March 1870, son of Alfred Reuben Watson (<i>b</i>. 1845), violinist and composer, who became musical director of the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, and his wife, Emily Morris Hobro. He was grandson of Reuben Watson, a consulting actuary to several friendly societies, including the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. After attending Nottingham high school Alfred Watson joined his grandfather's practice and studied for the fellowship of the Institute of Actuaries. In 1893, at the comparatively early age of twenty-three, he came top in the final examination for the fellowship, being the only candidate to be awarded a first class. He married, on 20 June 1895, Elizabeth Edith Moffrey (<i>b</i>. 1871/2), daughter of Robert William Moffrey JP, civil servant and a grand master of the Manchester Unity. They had one son (who died in childhood) and two daughters.<br>
<br>Watson's exceptional abilities as an authority on friendly society actuarial and financial matters were recognized in 1896 when&#151;aged only twenty-six&#151;he was invited to serve on the Treasury-controlled Rothschild committee which was set up by the government to investigate the viability of insurance-based old-age pension schemes. Despite his youth he played an important part in the committee's proceedings, subjecting several witnesses to rigorous cross-examination. Watson's strong support for the contributory insurance principle found favour with Treasury officials, who appreciated both his actuarial expertise and his views on the correct funding of any future state pension scheme. The most famous of his many publications was his pioneering study (published in 1903) of the sickness and mortality experience of Manchester Unity members during the five years 1893 to 1897 (contrasting this with data from earlier periods in the nineteenth century): though slightly flawed in methodology this work still stands as one of the few examinations of sickness and mortality by age, occupation, and region, and has been frequently cited by modern social historians.<br>
<br>Watson transferred his consulting practice to London in 1910, and was called upon to give expert advice to the framers of the 1911 <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span>. In 1912, after the bill had become law, he was invited to become chief actuary to the national health insurance joint committee (giving up his lucrative private practice in order to do so), and played a major part in steering the new scheme through its early years. During the First World War he gave statistical advice on innumerable issues to many government departments, most notably the Ministry of Shipping.<br>
<br>In 1917 Watson was appointed to the newly created post of government actuary. Ostensibly this position was necessitated by the development of national insurance, but its creation was also symptomatic of the Treasury's desire to impose greater control over public policy. (Watson's office was located in the Treasury, and in the inter-war years no policy proposal could proceed to legislation without the actuary's approval.) Watson was completely in accord with the Treasury's fiscal rectitude, and politicians found that their more exotic proposals were quickly squashed: as one official put it, Watson could be &#145;a little difficult, but more actuarial than awkward&#146;  (Dilks, 414). During his nineteen years as government actuary Watson served on numerous important official committees (including the 1924&#150;6 royal commission on national health insurance), was a key figure in the planning behind the 1925 contributory pension scheme, and advised on many other social policies. He also played a part in the centralization of social security policy that took place in the inter-war years. Apart from one notable mistake in under-predicting the level of unemployment in the 1920s (with serious consequences for the solvency of the unemployment insurance scheme) Watson's judgement was regarded as impeccable. He was knighted in 1915, created KCB in 1920, and was president of the Institute of Actuaries from 1920 to 1922.<br>
<br>On a personal level Watson was slightly unprepossessing in appearance. One associate affectionately portrayed him as &#145;a short, almost insignificant man, bald, a roundish face, sandy moustache, eyes that squinted so that it was hard to guess where they were looking or to whom he was speaking&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 May 1936). His undemonstrative and courteous manner was accompanied by a quiet voice; but this unassuming exterior concealed a firm resolve and powerful personality. He always impressed his colleagues by his acute intelligence, linguistic skills, and formidable ability to interpret the most complex of statistical tables at a glance. Watson never enjoyed robust health, and worked excessively hard at his official duties. He died unexpectedly on 7 May 1936 at his home, 16 Castello Avenue, Putney, London. His remains were cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 11 May. On his death many tributes were paid to his remarkable abilities as a senior civil servant and expert actuary. What is less well known is Watson's enormous influence on social policy making in the inter-war years, quietly exerted within the portals of Whitehall.<br>
