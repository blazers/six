<span class="headword">Morshead, Sir  Leslie James</span>  (1889&#150;1959), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 18 September 1889 at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, the fourth son and fifth child of William Morshead, a miner, and his wife, Mary Eliza Rennison. He was educated at Mount Pleasant state school, Ballarat, and the teachers' training college, Melbourne. He taught at the Armidale School, New South Wales, and when war broke out in 1914 was a master at the Melbourne Church of England grammar school. Having been commissioned in the 2nd battalion, 1st Australian Imperial Force, in September 1914, he landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915, the first day of the Gallipoli landings, as a captain and second-in-command of a company. He was promoted major in June 1915 but in October he contracted enteric fever and was invalided to Australia. On recovery he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and given command of the new 33rd battalion (part of Major-General John Monash's 3rd division), which he trained in Australia and England and took to France in September 1916. He commanded it until the conclusion of hostilities, leading it with rare distinction at Armenti&egrave;res, Messines, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, and along the Somme in the 1918 final offensives. By the end of the war he had been wounded twice, mentioned in dispatches, and received the DSO (1917), CMG (1919), and L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>After demobilization Morshead tried sheep farming near Merriwa, New South Wales, but soon joined the staff of the Orient Steam Navigation Company; in 1948 he became its general manager in Australia. In 1921 Morshead married Myrtle, daughter of William Woodside, of Melbourne; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Between the wars Morshead combined success in business with continued interest in the citizen military forces. From 1920 to 1931 he commanded citizen force battalions, and in 1933 he was promoted colonel and given command of an infantry brigade. When war broke out in 1939 he was selected to command 18th brigade, one of the first formations raised for overseas service with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force (AIF). In February 1941 he was promoted major-general and given command of the new 9th Australian division.<br>
<br>Incomplete, ill-equipped, and only partly trained, Morshead's division was sent to Cyrenaica, Libya, in March 1941 to relieve the more experienced 6th division withdrawn for Greece. When the British forces in Cyrenaica were driven back in April 1941 into Tobruk (which had been captured by the Australian 6th division in January 1941) by the sudden onslaught of the Afrika Korps, Morshead became the fortress commander (from 14 April). His resolute leadership quickly welded his motley collection of Australian, British and other troops into an effective fighting force which vigorously fought off Rommel's attempts to capture Tobruk.<br>
<br>The division was relieved in October 1941 and was recuperating in Syria when the remainder of the AIF was transferred from the Middle East to the Pacific early in 1942. Morshead was promoted lieutenant-general and became general officer commanding (GOC) the AIF in the Middle East. He led his division with distinction at the battles of El Alamein (July and October&#150;November 1942), and then took it to the south-west Pacific area. After a short period in command of New Guinea force (GOC 1943) he commanded the 1st Australian corps (1944) and directed the complicated amphibious operations which resulted in the recapture of Borneo (1945). He was mentioned in dispatches and made CBE (1941), KBE (1942,) and KCB (1942), and was awarded foreign honours.<br>
<br>Morshead was one of the finest products of the Australian citizen force system of military service. Slight of build, he had a mild facial expression which masked a strong personality, the impact of which, even on first acquaintance, was quickly felt. He was unsparing and outspoken in criticism, yet also quick to commend and praise. Nicknamed &#145;Ming the Merciless&#146; by his troops, he became just &#145;Ming&#146; as they learned to appreciate the quality of his leadership, particularly his talents as a battle commander.<br>
<br>After the war Morshead returned to business pursuits and occupied important positions in Australian commerce and industry: general manager in Australia of the Orient Line and a director of the Bank of New South Wales, Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company, Trustees Executors and Agency Company, and the Australian National Airways and Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. In 1957 the Menzies government appointed Morshead chairman of a high-level committee (the Morshead committee) on the defence departments. It reported in December 1957 and February 1958 and its recommendations included amalgamation of the three service departments with the department of defence. However, most of the recommendations were shelved. Morshead died in Sydney on 26 September 1959.<br>
