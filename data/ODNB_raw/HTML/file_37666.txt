</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Le Queux,  William Tufnell</span>  (1864&#150;1927), <span class="occ">author and self-publicist</span>, was born on 2 July 1864 at 5 Mina Terrace, Southwark, London, the eldest son of a Frenchman, William Le Queux 
    (or Lequeux; <i>c</i>.1823&#150;1890)
  , draper's assistant, and his English wife, Henrietta Marie (<i>b</i>. 1837), daughter of Thomas Henson, clock and watch maker. The 1871 census reported an apparently impecunious household, with one illiterate general servant girl and two lodgers. Le Queux's own accounts of his life are unreliable, and little is known definitely. He claimed to have been educated privately in London and at Pegli, near Genoa, to have studied art in Paris until 1884, and to have travelled and worked on the continent. He also claimed to have been a journalist in Paris, and to have been encouraged by Zola to write novels. In the 1880s he did work as a journalist in England on various local papers and on <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, but he left it in 1893 and devoted himself principally to writing fiction, though still contributing intermittently to newspapers.<br>
<br>Le Queux's first novel was <span class="italic">Guilty Bonds</span> (1890), a melodrama about Russian nihilists. He was a prolific writer who, in addition to short stories and articles, averaged over five novels a year, a total of more than two hundred. He wrote, rapidly and carelessly, melodramatic thrillers of crime and love, with enticing titles such as <span class="italic">A Secret Sin</span>, <span class="italic">The Indiscretions of a Lady's Maid</span>, <span class="italic">Sins of the City</span>, and <span class="italic">Wiles of the Wicked</span>. He was proudly &#145;cosmopolitan&#146;, and many of his novels were set in continental and other exotic locations, with a knowingness of hotels and casinos, and a smattering of French and Italian phrases. His hero was usually a well-born, wealthy clubman: travelled, worldly, and somewhat cynical. His heroine was young, beautiful, well dressed, and usually mysterious and under the influence of the villain. His villains were wicked, often foreign, and ingenious. Their crimes included murder by bizarre methods: explosive bon-bons, a cobra in bed, and&#151;in <span class="italic">The Death Doctor</span> (1912), his most repulsive fiction&#151;tetanus in soap and rabies in ointment, and attempted murder by an electrified statue. He became one of the most popular novelists, whose extensive and varied readership reportedly included Queen Alexandra and A. J. Balfour, and did include the young Dennis Wheatley and Graham Greene. Indicative of his popularity, in 1898 he was among the highest paid fiction writers at 12 guineas per thousand words, the same rate as Thomas Hardy and H. G. Wells.<br>
<br>Most influential and controversial of Le Queux's fiction were his tales of invasion and of espionage. G. T. Chesney's <span class="italic">The Battle of Dorking</span> (1871) had established the popular genre of future-war fiction, and in 1893 Alfred Harmsworth commissioned from the little-known Le Queux a serial, &#145;The Poisoned Bullet&#146;, which was published in <span class="italic">Answers</span>, and then in book form as <span class="italic">The Great War in England in 1897</span> (1894). A tale of surprise French invasion, it warned of British vulnerability and military unpreparedness. In the period of defence anxiety following the South African War, Le Queux joined the National Service League. From about 1905 he was a self-proclaimed patriot and a Germanophobe defence publicist, one of those condemned by their opponents as &#145;scaremongers&#146;. He was active in Roger Pocock's Legion of Frontiersmen. In 1906 Le Queux, advised by Lord Roberts and H. W. Wilson, wrote for Lord Northcliffe's <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>&#151;the largest-circulation daily paper&#151;a sensational serial of German invasion, &#145;The invasion of 1910&#146;, later published in book form. It warned of British vulnerability and German atrocities, and urged the introduction of compulsory military training as demanded by Lord Roberts and the National Service League. Much publicized, denounced, and satirized, it became Le Queux's best-known work.<br>
<br>From the 1890s Le Queux wrote fiction warning of French, Russian, and later German spies in Britain. In 1909 his sensational serial &#145;Spies of the Kaiser&#146; appeared in D. C. Thompson's <span class="italic">Weekly News</span>, then was expanded into the book <span class="italic">Spies of the Kaiser: Plotting the Downfall of England</span>. This aroused much concern, and readers wrote to Le Queux reporting alleged spies. He passed the letters to Lieutenant-Colonel J. E. Edmonds of MO5 who used them, with other evidence, some from Le Queux, to convince the committee of imperial defence of the necessity of a secret service, leading to the establishment of the Secret Service Bureau (later MI5 and MI6).<br>
<br>An avid self-publicist, Le Queux wrote his way from obscurity to wealth and celebrity. The profits from his thrillers bought the image and lifestyle to which he aspired: the cosmopolitan clubman, man of the world, and man of mystery. Boyishly enthusiastic, opportunist, snobbish, name-dropping, sociable yet secretive, delighting in being mysterious, he was apparently a sort of Walter Mitty. He presented himself as a hero involved in dangerous adventures, and listed &#145;revolver practice&#146; in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry. He claimed an expert knowledge of crime and criminology. He claimed he was an expert on spying and that he was involved in espionage and counter-espionage for Britain, and he gave public lectures warning of foreign spies. His appearance, however, was not that of his fictional heroes. He was portly, genial, and wore pince-nez. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> obituarist wrote that he was &#145;an amiable and placid little man, who looked as if he caught the 9.15 from Ealing to the City every morning&#146;. He became for a time the Birmingham consul of the republic of San Marino and wore his gorgeous uniform for publicity photographs; he gained and proudly wore continental orders.<br>
<br>Le Queux travelled widely. His anonymous Balkan reportage, <span class="italic">An Observer in the Near East</span> (1907), was anti-Austrian and pro-Serbian. He repeatedly changed residence, sometimes living in Italy. On 23 November 1887 he married Florence Alice, 25 years old, daughter of Alfred Thomas Dorsett, artist (deceased). In January 1901 she died after fracturing her skull by falling down steps at their Lambeth home: the inquest ruled accidental death. On 22 February 1902 he married at Kensington register office an Italian, Luisa Gemma (declared age 27 years), daughter of Ferdinando Cioni. <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span>, presumably echoing Le Queux, described her as &#145;a member of one of the oldest Florentine families&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span>, Dec 1904, 693). They had no children, and by 1910 they had separated.<br>
<br>Le Queux was involved in various business ventures, including allegedly selling army boots to the Bulgarian government and film-making. In 1913 he did not pay his wife money due under the deed of separation and she took bankruptcy proceedings against him. In October he told the assistant official receiver he had lost money on unsuccessful attempts to operate a casino in Corfu and to sell war stores to Serbia, and that until 1910 his annual income had been &pound;5000 and his annual expenditure &pound;3000. He was declared bankrupt and had to resign his consulate. His losses suggest his fantasizing may have spilled over into his business ventures, and he may have been gullible and deceived.<br>
<br>Like other &#145;scaremongers&#146; Le Queux flourished during the First World War. He was an amateur spy hunter, lectured extensively on espionage and the German threat, wrote for Horatio Bottomley's <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, demanded the internment of enemy aliens, and denounced the German &#145;invisible hand&#146; in Britain. He wrote sensational anti-German fiction presented as fact, including <span class="italic">German Spies in England</span> (1915) and <span class="italic">Love Intrigues of the Kaiser's Sons</span> (1918), and in a similar mode wrote <span class="italic">Rasputin the Rascal Monk</span> (1917) and <span class="italic">The Minister of Evil</span> (1917).<br>
<br>After 1918 Le Queux continued to write thrillers. <span class="italic">Rasputinism in London</span> (1919), for example, was about a Clapham curate&#151;a Keble man and &#145;satanic scoundrel&#146;&#151;who established a Rasputinist cult among rich women drug takers based in the Cromwell Road. Le Queux continued his amateur wireless experiments, with more publicity than originality. In 1923 he published his unreliable, largely fictitious memoirs, <span class="italic">Things I Know about Kings, Celebrities and Crooks</span>. Apparently resenting lack of official recognition in Britain, from 1923 he spent much time in Switzerland, skiing and writing tourist publicity. After several weeks' illness, he died from heart failure on 13 October 1927 at the Links Hotel, Knocke, Belgium, and was cremated at Golders Green, London, on 19 October.<br>
<br>Before and during the war, although criticized, Le Queux had been influential, but by 1927, according to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> obituarist, &#145;with the cultured reader he passed as a modern variant of Baron M&uuml;nchausen&#146;. Le Queux's own version of his life was essentially repeated in N. St B. Sladen's <span class="italic">The Real Le Queux</span> (1938), in derivative reference works, and belatedly in <span class="italic">Missing Persons</span> (1993). However, from the 1970s into the 1990s historians researching Le Queux, &#145;spy fever&#146;, &#145;scaremongers&#146;, and the secret service revealed further information, which formed the basis of a more accurate, if less flattering, portrayal.<br>
