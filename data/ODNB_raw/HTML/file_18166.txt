<span class="headword">Marston,  Philip Bourke</span>  (1850&#150;1887), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at 123 Camden Road Villas, Camden Town, London, on 13 August 1850. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18165/', "John Westland Marston (1819&#150;1890)")</script>, a trained solicitor who abandoned this career for the theatre and poetry, and his wife, Eleanor Jane Potts (<i>d</i>. 1870). The poet Philip James Bailey and the novelist Dinah Mulock Craik were his godparents, and a popular poem by Craik, &#145;Philip, my King&#146;, is addressed to him.<br>
<br>When Marston was only three years old his sight became impaired, a loss attributed variously to an infection following an accidental blow, to the use of belladonna against scarlet fever, and to cataracts. For many years he could still see, in his own words, &#145;the tree-boughs waving in the wind, the pageant of sunset in the west, and the glimmer of a fire upon the hearth&#146;; but by the time he was twenty he was completely blind. Nevertheless, his contemporary biographers all commented on his large, beautiful, dark brown eyes. As a consequence of his disability, he never learned to read, and his poetry was always dictated.<br>
<br>Some work done when Marston was only fifteen was included in <span class="italic">Song-Tide and Other Poems</span> (1871). It was dedicated to his mother, who had helped him prepare it for the press, but who had died in 1870. In November 1871 he was devastated by the death of his fianc&eacute;e, Mary Nesbit, and in 1874 his close friend Oliver Madox Brown also died.<br>
<br>Marston had grown up in a house whose regular visitors included Algernon Charles Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and their reception of his work was very favourable: Rossetti famously declared some of his lyrics worthy of Shakespeare. Their compliments remained a source of pride until the end of his life, and he maintained a wide literary circle. After Mary's death his sister Cicely acted as his eyes, and they lived together in London. They made frequent trips together to France, and one to Italy. In 1875 he published <span class="italic">All in All</span>, which, though dedicated to his father, consisted mainly of poems to Mary. In that anthology, the single poem dedicated to Cicely begins with the line &#145;What were I, dear, without thee?&#146; She died of consumption, very suddenly, in 1878. Marston and his father were in France at the time and could not be reached; they returned to find that they had missed even her funeral. Eleanor, the surviving sister, was by then an invalid and she died early the next year, followed by her husband, the poet Arthur O'Shaughnessy (1844&#150;1881). Rossetti, Marston's lifelong mentor, died in 1882.<br>
<br>Deeply grieved by these losses, Marston had also, in 1880, run out of money. His friends, in particular Dinah Mulock Craik, raised enough to support him on that occasion, but his living was always precarious. Although he still lived in London with his father, the main market for his writing was in the United States. Marston's short stories were published in <span class="italic">The Cornhill</span>, and he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Harper's</span>. He did not particularly enjoy writing these potboilers, though the best of them was, he felt, &#145;Miss Stotford's Speciality&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1883 <span class="italic">Wind-Voices</span> appeared&#151;the last of Marston's works to be published within his lifetime&#151;and from then his health began to decline and he became an alcoholic. From that time, too, he established a literary club, &#145;The Vagabonds&#146;, which met monthly at his home at 191 Euston Road. In early 1887, while on a summer tour in Brighton with his father, he was taken ill, and he died at home of apoplexy on 14 February. According to his own wishes, he was buried in unconsecrated ground without a religious service at Highgate cemetery in London on 18 February.<br>
<br>Marston's remembrance was secured largely by his two friends, the American poet Louise Chandler Moulton, and William Sharp. She published two posthumous collections of his poems, <span class="italic">Garden Secrets</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">A Last Harvest</span> (1891). She also produced, in 1892, <span class="italic">The Collected Poems of Philip Bourke Marston, with Biographical Sketch and Portrait</span>. Sharp collected his short stories under the title <span class="italic">For a Song's Sake and other Stories</span> (1887). Marston's poem &#145;After&#146; was set to music by Edward Elgar, and Swinburne dedicated a sonnet to his memory. Throughout, Marston's works are characterized by a melancholy which has been attributed to the many tragedies of his life, particularly to the number of bereavements that he experienced. The mournful quality of his writing, however, was ultimately criticized by his contemporaries as repetitive, if beautiful.<br>
