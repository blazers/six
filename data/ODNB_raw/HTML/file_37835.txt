<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Thomas Herbert  Parry-</span>  (1887&#150;1975), <span class="occ">Welsh scholar and writer</span>, was born at T&#375;'r Ysgol, Rhyd-ddu, Caernarvonshire on 21 September 1887, the second child and eldest son in the family of four sons and two daughters of Henry Parry-Williams (1858&#150;1925), schoolmaster at Rhyd-ddu, and his wife, Ann Morris (<i>b</i>. 1859). He was educated at Porthmadog intermediate school, the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (1905&#150;9), Jesus College in Oxford (1909&#150;11), Freiburg University (1911&#150;13), and the &Eacute;cole des Hautes &Eacute;tudes at the Sorbonne in Paris (1913&#150;14). He graduated with the degrees of MA (Wales), BLitt (Oxon.), and PhD (Freiburg). During his period of study at Freiburg and Paris he held a fellowship of the University of Wales. His teachers included Edward Anwyl, John Rhys, Rudolf Thurneysen, and Joseph Vendryes, four of the most renowned scholars in Celtic studies in Parry-Williams's generation.<br>
<br>While still a student in 1912 Parry-Williams won both the chair (for his <i>awdl</i> &#145;Y mynach&#146;) and the crown (for his <i>pryddest</i> &#145;Gerallt Gymro&#146;) at the national eisteddfod of Wales in Wrexham, a feat repeated by him in 1915 at the national eisteddfod held in Bangor (for his <i>awdl</i> &#145;Eryri&#146; and the <i>pryddest</i> &#145;Y ddinas&#146;). From 1914 to 1919 he was lecturer in the department of Welsh at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Following dissension over the appointment to a professorship at Aberystwyth in 1919 (connected, in part, with his having been a conscientious objector during the First World War) he withdrew from his academic post in order to study in the faculty of science at the University College. For a year he studied botany, chemistry, physics, and zoology with the intention of undertaking further training to qualify as a medical doctor. The painful turmoil and oppression of that period influenced him greatly, instilling in him a markedly dark cynicism, deep indecision, and humanistic uncertainty, characteristics that pervade much of his writing. In 1920, however, he was elected to the chair of Welsh at Aberystwyth, a post he held until his retirement in 1952.<br>
<br>Parry-Williams was a distinguished philologist, editor, and critic. His Freiburg PhD dissertation, &#145;Some points of similarity in the phonology of Welsh and Breton&#146;, was published in 1913, and his pioneering <span class="italic">The English Element in Welsh</span> in 1923. He took a special interest in early free-metre poetry in Welsh, editing <span class="italic">Carolau Richard White</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Canu rhydd cynnar</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Hen benillion</span> (1940). He was joint editor of <span class="italic">Llawysgrif Hendregadredd</span> (1933), an especially important source for the study of Middle Welsh court poetry, and wrote a treatise on the nature of poetry, <span class="italic">Elfennau barddoniaeth</span> (1935). He also published a translation of German short stories, <span class="italic">Ystor&iuml;au Bohemia</span> (1921), and a modern Welsh version of the Middle Welsh mythological prose narrative tales <span class="italic">Pedair cainc y Mabinogi</span> (1937). He edited a collection of Welsh short stories, <span class="italic">Ystor&iuml;au heddiw</span> in 1938. On 26 August 1942 he married Emiah Jane 
    (Amy; 1910&#150;1988)
  , the daughter of Lewis Thomas of Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, a civil servant with the Inland Revenue. She was a lecturer in a training college, and they had no children.<br>
<br>Parry-Williams continued with his work, editing a series of discussions with Welsh poets analysing poetic creative processes, <span class="italic">Y bardd yn ei weithdy</span> (1948); a selection of the poetry of the influential and complex nineteenth-century Welsh poet William Thomas, <span class="italic">Islwyn: detholion o'i farddoniaeth</span> (1948); a selection of the works of Richard Davies, <span class="italic">Caniadau Isgarn</span> (1949); and a valuable selection of early modern Welsh prose preserved in manuscripts, <span class="italic">Rhyddiaith Gymraeg</span>, 1, <span class="italic">Detholion o lawysgrifau, 1488&#150;1609</span> (1954). He published a lively bilingual appraisal of his Oxford teacher, <span class="italic">John Rh&#375;s (1840&#150;1915)</span> (1954), and delivered the British Academy Sir John Rh&#375;s memorial lecture for 1946, &#145;Welsh poetic diction&#146;, and the annual BBC Wales lecture for 1958, &#145;Ymhel &acirc; phrydyddu&#146; (&#145;On the creative pursuit of poetry&#146;). His Oxford O'Donnell lecture, &#145;English&#150;Welsh loan-words&#146;, was published in <span class="italic">Angles and Britons: O'Donnell Lectures</span> (1963). He edited a selection of national eisteddfod-winning chair poems from the period 1926&#150;50 and the 1954 Ystradgynlais national eisteddfod's volume of compositions and adjudications. He also edited a selection of Welsh literature, <span class="italic">Newydd a hen: detholion o lenyddiaeth Gymraeg</span> (1954).<br>
<br>Only rarely did Parry-Williams write in English, other than on linguistic topics. A notable exception is his volume <span class="italic">Sonnets (1919&#150;20)</span>, published in 1932. These compositions tend to be stilted and uneasy, lacking the immediacy and fluency found regularly in his powerful use of the sonnet form in Welsh. He very frequently translated into Welsh words set to music by composers such as Wagner, Brahms, Handel, Beethoven, Schubert, and Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, as well as contemporary composers, nearly all for performances in national eisteddfod concerts or competitions.<br>
<br>Parry-Williams reacted to the excesses of traditionalist neo-grammarian linguistics and derived greater satisfaction from creative writing in Welsh, both prose and verse. He was one of the most sensitive and influential writers of the twentieth-century renaissance in Welsh literature and came to be regarded as a remarkable innovator in both style and theme. His essays and poems are a stimulating contribution to meditative writing in Welsh, marked by a searching and courageous intelligence and by a truly superb mastery of his native language. His creative works include <span class="italic">Ysgrifau</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Cerddi: rhigymau a sonedau</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Olion: ysgrifau a rhigymau</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Synfyfyrion: ysgrifau, rhigymau, sonedau</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Lloffion</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Ugain o gerddi</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Myfyrdodau</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">Pensynnu</span> (1966). An extensive selection of his poetry was published in <span class="italic">Detholiad o gerddi</span> (1972). A modest and very inspiring person, he came to be regarded as the most existentialist Welsh writer of his generation, time and time again concerned with abstract concepts, on the face of it anti-religious but in reality deeply involved in spiritual matters. He has been described as an old-fashioned critical modernist, with clear indications of positivism in his work and displaying an irrational reaction to, and a great concern for, what he regarded as transcendental values. His creative work commonly presents striking images of despair and surfeit, of the exterminating worry and triviality of life. His frequent flashes of light-hearted humour were commonly tinged with an awesome irony. His essays in particular display his fine mastery of a mature and confident style, exploiting a great wealth and variety of patterns, sounds, rhythms, senses, vocabulary (often reflecting colloquialisms and dialectal usage), and tropes in abundance. A gifted public speaker, he was at his best reading aloud his own work and delivering stylish, penetrating eisteddfodic adjudications in his memorably sonorous voice.<br>
<br>Parry-Williams was admitted to the degree of DLitt on two occasions (Wales 1934, Oxford 1937) and to the honorary degree of LLD, by the University of Wales in 1960. He was warden of the guild of graduates of the University of Wales, chairman of the BBC's Welsh consultative council, president of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (the society honoured him with its medal), president of the court and a fellow of the national eisteddfod of Wales, president of the National Library of Wales, and an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. He was knighted in 1958. Parry-Williams died of a heart attack on 3 March 1975 at his home at Wern North Road, Aberystwyth, and was buried in the Beddgelert cemetery, Caernarvonshire.<br>
