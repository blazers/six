<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  Charles Pyndar Beauchamp</span>  (1817&#150;1894), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 7 October 1817, the eldest son of Charles Ludlow Walker of Redland, JP and deputy lieutenant of Gloucestershire, and Mary Anne, daughter of Revd Reginald Pyndar of Hadsor, Worcestershire, and Kempley, Gloucestershire, cousin of the first Earl Beauchamp. He was a commoner at Winchester College from 1831 to 1833. He was commissioned ensign in the 33rd foot on 27 February 1836, and became lieutenant on 21 June 1839 and captain on 22 December 1846. He served with the regiment at Gibraltar, in the West Indies, and in North America. On 16 November 1849 he exchanged into the 7th dragoon guards. He married in 1845 Georgiana, daughter of Captain Richard Armstrong of the 100th foot. She survived him.<br>
<br>On 25 March 1854 Walker was appointed aide-de-camp to Lord Lucan, who commanded the cavalry division in the Crimea. He was present at Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was also present at the naval attack on Sevastopol on 17 October, where he acted as aide-de-camp to Lord George Paulet on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, and was awarded the Mejidiye (fifth class).<br>
<br>On 8 December 1854 Walker was promoted major in his regiment, and in anticipation of this he left the Crimea at the beginning of that month. He was appointed assistant quartermaster-general in Ireland on 9 July 1855, and on 9 November he was given an unattached lieutenant-colonelcy. On 7 December 1858 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd dragoon guards (the Queen's Bays). He joined them in India, and took part in the later operations against the rebels. He commanded a field force in Oudh, with which he defeated the rebels at Bungdon on 27 April 1859, and a month afterwards served in the action of the Jirwah Pass under Sir Hope Grant. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>From India Walker went on to China, being appointed on 14 May 1860 assistant quartermaster-general of cavalry in Sir Hope Grant's expedition. He was present at the actions of Sinho, Changkiawan (Zhangjiawan), and Palichiao (Baliqiao). In the advance on Peking (Beijing) he went ahead to select the camping-grounds, and on 16 September, when Sir Harry Smith Parkes and others were treacherously seized during the truce, he narrowly escaped. His sword was found when Changkiawan was stormed and sacked later in the day, 18 September 1860. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was made CB on 28 February 1861. He had become colonel in the army on 14 December 1860.<br>
<br>Back in England, Walker went on half pay on 11 June 1861, and on 1 July was appointed assistant quartermaster-general at Shorncliffe. He remained there until 31 March 1865. On 26 April he was made military attach&eacute; at Berlin, and he held that post for nearly twelve years. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 he was attached to the headquarters of the crown prince's army as British military commissioner, and was present at the battles of Nachod and K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. He was again attached to the crown prince's army in the Franco-Prussian War, and was present at Weissenburg, W&ouml;rth, Sedan, and throughout the siege of Paris. He was given the medal and the Iron Cross. The irritation of the Germans against England and the number of roving Englishmen made his task difficult, but he was tactful and genial and his action had the approval of the government.<br>
<br>Walker was promoted major-general on 29 December 1873 (afterwards antedated to 6 March 1868). He resigned his post at Berlin on 31 March 1877, and became lieutenant-general on 1 October. He was inspector-general of military education from January 1878 until 7 October 1884, when he was retired with the honorary rank of general. He had been made KCB on 24 May 1881, and colonel of the 2nd dragoon guards on 22 December 1881. He died at his London residence, 97 Onslow Square, South Kensington, on 19 January 1894, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. Extracts from his letters and journals during active service were published after his death as <span class="italic">Days of a Soldier's Life</span> (1894).<br>
