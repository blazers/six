<span class="headword">Jones,  Rice</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1650&#150;1663), <span class="occ">Quaker schismatic</span>, was a Baptist soldier from Nottingham prior to joining the Society of Friends. According to George Fox, Jones and John Trentam of Mansfield in Nottinghamshire left the Quakers in 1650 and &#145;drew a great company after them &amp; opposed the truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.314). They held their meetings in the castle yard at Nottingham. When Jones was on his way to participate in the battle of Worcester the following year he visited Fox, who was then a prisoner at Derby. Having taken Fox's views about the primacy of the indwelling of Christ literally, he reputedly castigated Fox for having placed his faith in &#145;a man that dyed att Jerusalem &amp; there was never any such thinge&#146;. When Fox retorted that Christ had been persecuted by Pilate, the chief priests, and &#145;professinge Jewes&#146;, Jones labelled Fox a chief priest and insisted that prophets, apostles, and holy men suffered inwardly, never externally  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 1.10&#150;11). Fox blamed Jones and his followers for the erroneous accusation that Quakers denied the historical Christ.<br>
<br>In 1654 James Nayler visited Jones, finding that in &#145;the things of god he is exceeding darke &hellip; many Confused words came forth, as swearing marry&#146;. Although he apologized for offending Nayler, Jones saw no sin in swearing, nor did he repudiate oaths, without which, he argued, the &#145;heathen&#146; would not believe Quakers  (Swarthmore MS 3, fol. 75). About the same time he and his colleagues prophesied that Fox was at his zenith and would soon fall as rapidly as he had risen, and they distributed papers accusing the Quakers of improperly proclaiming their message in churches and markets. In an epistle to London Friends in 1654, Fox denounced Jones for having castigated the monthly meetings to assist the poor as &#145;moon-light Meetings&#146;. Because Jones repudiated the Quakers' judgements and admonitions, which Fox claimed had been rendered in the spirit of God, he was denounced by the Quaker leader as a son of the devil and an opponent of gospel order  (Penington MS 4, fol. 80). At Fox's invitation, approximately eighty of Jones's followers met with him at Nottingham in 1658. Similar efforts to convince the Proud Quakers, as Jones's people were known, were made by George Whitehead and Richard Hubberthorne, and in time some of them embraced mainstream Quaker tenets.<br>
<br>There is no evidence to determine the number of Proud Quakers, who were probably so-called because they refused to humble themselves and follow Fox. All of the information about Jones and his adherents comes from hostile sources and should be assessed with caution. They reputedly embraced worldly customs and fashion, claiming they had the freedom to do so as long as they were inwardly committed to God. Some of them were known for their skill as wrestlers and football players, and Fox accused them of playing shovel-board on Sundays. Jones had no objection to taking oaths tendered by civil authorities, and Fox accused him of profanity. The opposition of the Proud Quakers to Fox's efforts to persuade Friends of means to assist their less fortunate fellow believers suggests that they were relatively prosperous. Fox sent a letter warning the Proud Quakers of their erroneous ways in 1660. Three years later Lodowick Muggleton referred to a society at Nottingham that comprised Quakers and followers of the mystic Jakob Boehme, by which he apparently meant Jones's group. When Jones's economic fortunes declined, he opened an alehouse, and his colleague Trentam, having turned from the Spirit to spirits, became an alcoholic. The Proud Quakers probably disintegrated in the 1660s, for Fox later observed that &#145;most of all there people came to nought but what turned againe to ffrendes &amp; truth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.314).<br>
