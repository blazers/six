<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wharton,  Thomas</span>, first marquess of Wharton, first marquess of Malmesbury, and first marquess of Catherlough  (1648&#150;1715), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in late August 1648, the third but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29170/', "Philip Wharton, fourth Baron Wharton (1613&#150;1696)")</script>, politician, and his second wife, Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1618, <i>d</i>. 1658), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10987/', "Arthur Goodwin")</script>. Young Thomas was born into English politics. His birth elicited a letter from Oliver Cromwell, who congratulated Lord Wharton and the &#145;dear little lady&#146; on the new heir. Cromwell hoped that Lord Wharton would see the birth of &#145;the young baron&#146; as a divine mercy and that it would draw him nearer to the despised but victorious saints  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. 49, fol. 25).<h2>
<a name="Apiouseducation"></a>A pious education</h2>A few months later, when Colonel Pride purged the House of Commons and Charles I was executed, Lord Wharton distanced himself both literally and figuratively from the new regime. He moved from his London house in Clerkenwell and retired to Upper Winchendon, one of his rich estates on the hills of northern Buckinghamshire. This decision meant that young Thomas (Tom to his family and eventually to political England) spent most of the first ten years of his life at Winchendon. He maintained his principal base of operations there even after he inherited many other manors, in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Westmorland.<br>
<br>The Whartons were notably pious. Lord Wharton, a Calvinist himself, was a patron of presbyterian and Independent ministers. The Wharton children lived among men who took life, the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and God's will very seriously. But if Lord Wharton was a precisian who had scruples against plays and Sunday travel and who feared that kissing the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in taking oaths might constitute idolatry, he was also an English aristocrat with an eye for beauty and a feeling for the social graces. His scruples stopped short where music, dance, and poetry were concerned. The Wharton children were not merely permitted, but required, to take music and dancing lessons, and the youngest son, William, became a poet. Like his friend Andrew Marvell, Lord Wharton loved gardens. He also loved painting and his collection of Van Dycks rivalled that of Charles I. His son Tom inherited his tastes as well as his gardens and art collections.<br>
<br>The year 1658 began the transformation of the Wharton world. On 21 April Lady Wharton died, leaving her children to be raised by servants; and on 3 September Oliver Cromwell died, leaving the puritan cause to disintegrate. Lord Wharton abandoned Winchendon for Wooburn, in southern Buckinghamshire, and leased a London town house at St Giles-in-the-Fields. the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the subsequent re-establishment of the Anglican church brought further changes. In the new order nonconformists were removed from the universities and from church livings. This meant, among many other things, that young Thomas would not be sent to Oxford or Cambridge and that his principal tutors would be unemployed dons. Another major change in the boy's world occurred in August 1661 when Lord Wharton married Anne, widow of Colonel Edward Popham and daughter of William Carr.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Tom Wharton had been undergoing a rigorous course of study, including four hours a day of Greek and Latin, under tutors Abraham Clifford, Thomas Elford, and Philip Romerill. In June 1662 his education was taken over by the scholarly Theophilus Gale, an Independent and a former fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Gale, who had agreed to supervise Tom and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38118/', "Goodwin Wharton")</script> during an educational sojourn in France and a tour of Europe, was favourably impressed by his student. The lad, he told Lord Wharton, had &#145;a quick and apprehensive&#146; mind and was obviously &#145;fit to take in the more noble parts of humane literature&#146;. He was perhaps &#145;a little intent&#146; upon sports and somewhat difficult to arouse at five in the morning, but he seemed very tractable, and he would no doubt make great academic progress  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. 49, fols. 44, 48). Gale went to France in 1662 to select a place for the boys' education. Tom and Goodwin did not arrive in Caen, Gale's choice, until 25 June 1663.<br>
<br>The young men stayed in Caen, a Huguenot stronghold, almost two years until April 1665. There Tom, in formal classes for the first time at the age of fifteen, impressed his French masters with his Latin oratory and rhetoric, achieving &#145;such perfection&#146;, according to Gale, that the regent published specimens of his art &#145;about the town&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawlinson 49, fol. 101). Outgoing and personable he was immediately popular with his French classmates. This popularity led in turn to his first recorded revolt. When Gale insisted upon screening the boys he brought home to the pension Tom disputed his authority and then went on to question other strict rules. Robert Bennett, deprived vicar at Winchendon, sent by Lord Wharton to investigate, agreed that Gale, a good man in the wrong place, should be recalled, and in October 1664 Abraham Clifford took over the boys' education in Caen. A puritan like Gale, but much more adroit at handling adolescent youngsters, Clifford had been a fellow at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He quickly noted the intelligence of the young Whartons&#151;their &#145;quick, lively, and pregnant parts&#146;&#151;and their &#145;loving and ingenuous&#146; natures  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawlinson 53, fol. 7), and he soon learned the limits of Tom's complaisance. Now sixteen the young man insisted upon choosing his own companions, and he bristled at the mere suggestion of leaving Caen. Too wise to provoke another battle Clifford let Tom bring his friends, both choice and questionable, to the pension where they could be supervised, and he waited for a direct order from Lord Wharton before setting out for Paris, which they reached on 24 April 1665.<br>
<br>The planned grand tour, however, was disrupted by war and the plague and dwindled to a few weeks of sightseeing in the Spanish Netherlands. On 10 October the young men were back in their Paris lodgings. Before new instructions arrived from Lord Wharton disease and politics intervened again. On 21 November, the day after Lord Holles, the English ambassador, had taken the boys to see Louis XIV, Tom came down with a virulent attack of smallpox. While he was recovering it became clear that France would join the Dutch in their war against England, and Lord Wharton ordered the boys home. It was 1 June 1666 before the young men actually boarded ship at Dieppe and set out for England and Wooburn&#151;three years after they had left.<br>
<br>Wharton's education in France had at least two significant effects upon his political career. From his puritan tutors he received a command of scriptures and religious controversy that, along with a mordant wit, would make him formidable in parliamentary debates on toleration, schism, and occasional conformity and that would help him defend men like Gale and Clifford against Anglicans who wished to silence them. Also important was the young man's saturation in the French language (the language of diplomacy, and sometimes of treason).<h2>
<a name="Marriagehorseracingandpolitics"></a>Marriage, horse-racing, and politics</h2>Lord Wharton had made tentative passes at the problem of finding a rich and virtuous wife for his heir even before Tom had set out for France. In late 1671 began an intricate negotiation that lasted more than a year and sent Tom Wharton on four extended trips to Devon. The projected match involved a wealthy young lady named Elizabeth, daughter and heir of the late Richard Cabell, one-time sheriff of the county. In February and March 1673, however, Tom became involved in his first parliamentary election&#151;a disputed contest at Wendover against Alderman Edward Backwell. He had promised to return to Devon by 1 March, but he remained in London until 19 March, when the House of Commons decided the election in his favour. For Mrs Cabell this choice of politics over love confirmed her doubts as to his suitability. She broke off the match. After the repulse at Devon, Lord Wharton began negotiations for the hand of Anne Lee (1659&#150;1685) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29163/', "Wharton, Anne")</script>], coheir to the extensive properties of her father, Sir Henry Lee. Anne, who later achieved recognition as a poet, was born on 20 July 1659, four months after the death of her father and a few days before the death of her mother. Her guardian was her paternal grandmother, the dowager countess of Rochester. It was the countess and Sir Ralph Verney, a trustee of Anne's estate and a long-time neighbour of the Whartons, who arranged the match. The settlement gave Wharton &pound;8000 in cash and an annual income of about &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Before the marriage itself took place&#151;at Adderbury on 16 September 1673&#151;Wharton was challenged to a duel by a disappointed rival, John Arundell (son of Lord Arundell of Trerice). Ill with a fever and in danger enough &#145;if he had gone only to meet the cold air&#146;, as one of his friends said  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawlinson 53, fol. 27), Tom lost the duel. Arundell disarmed him and then in view of his courage granted him his life. (Wharton would win later, bloodless duels&#151;against Lord Haughton in 1687, Lord Cheyne in 1699, and young &#145;Mr. Dashwood&#146; in 1703&#151;disarming all three opponents.)<br>
<br>For Wharton his marriage with Anne Lee meant independence. With money and property settled upon him, a country house at Winchendon and a town house at Chelsea, with stables and gardens at both places, he was free from his father's supervision and rich enough to pursue his interests in politics and horse-racing.<br>
<br>While Wharton was learning his trade as a politician he was also beginning his career as an owner and, sometimes, rider of racehorses. Wharton's devotion to horses and racing became legendary. The tracks at Brackley, Woodstock, Campfield, Banstead Downs, Datchet, Quainton Meadows (Wharton's home course near Winchendon), and, above all, Newmarket were among Wharton's favourite haunts, and some of his horses&#151;Careless, Snail, Colchester, Chance, and Wharton's Gelding&#151;became famous in turf lore.<br>
<br>One of Wharton's first recorded victories occurred at Woodstock on 2 September 1676, for a plate worth &pound;50. Next day, however, he lost a match race and a &pound;100 wager to Lord Lovelace. Wharton's most dramatic loss came at Banstead Downs on 15 May 1679, when he was thrown from his horse, knocked unconscious, and &#145;taken up for dead&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 5.102). One of his expensive losses, &pound;500, came in a match race at Newmarket on 11 April 1698, when Careless, carrying too much additional weight, was beaten by King William's horse Stiff Dick. Perhaps Wharton's richest victory, also at Newmarket, came in April 1699 when Careless beat a horse backed by the duke of Devonshire for a wager of &pound;1900.<br>
<br>Wharton won his most prestigious race in France on 25 February 1683. On a racecourse near St Germain-en-Laye in an event sponsored by Louis XIV and witnessed by the king, the queen, and many French courtiers, Wharton's Gelding defeated a select field of horses from &#145;divers nations&#146; and won the king's plate, valued at 1000 pistoles (roughly &pound;850). &#145;Very much pleased&#146; with the English horse, which had been entered by the duke of Monmouth, Louis offered to buy it for another 1000 pistoles. Wharton, however, declined the offer. He would give Louis the horse as a present, he said, but he would not sell it. Louis, in turn, refused to accept the gift  (Oldmixon, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 97).<br>
<br>In the parliamentary sessions of 1675&#150;8 Wharton was still primarily a back-bench observer, and he missed the last two months of the summer session of 1678 when he took his wife, Anne, to Wiltshire for her health. He emerged from the political shadows after the &#145;revelations&#146; of Titus Oates and the furore surrounding the Popish Plot had deranged English politics. On 5 February 1679 he was elected at Aylesbury, along with young John Hampden, as knight of the shire for Buckinghamshire. Though the election was uncontested threats that the court would enter candidates and / or move the election to Buckingham made the Whartons and Hampdens assemble all their friends, including the duke of Buckingham. The entertainment at Aylesbury inns cost each candidate about &pound;800. Wharton would eventually spend (according to <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life</span>, 27) &#145;above &pound;80,000&#146; on elections.<br>
<br>At the second general election of 1679 Wharton and Hampden again stood for the county. This time Thomas Edgerley, the high sheriff, did move the election from Aylesbury to Buckingham. The last-minute manoeuvre failed. The young whigs, again aided by the duke, led an army of supporters to the enemy town and achieved another victory.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, as an exclusionist, Wharton opposed the duke of York both in and out of parliament. On 26 June 1680 he and a group of other whig notables, including Shaftesbury, met at Westminster Hall to submit to the Middlesex grand jury an information against the duke&#151;a list of reasons for believing what had never been officially admitted, that James was a Catholic. The jury, they hoped, would present James as a recusant before the judges of the king's bench. Even if he were acquitted, they reasoned, the propaganda value of a trial would be immense. The scheme was foiled, however, when the royal judges got wind of the plot and dismissed the grand jury for the term. The court did not try to unseat Wharton in the county election of 1681, when he stood with Richard Hampden. At the third Exclusion Parliament the king offered a regency plan; but the Commons, with an unassailable whig majority, insisted upon exclusion. Wharton was appointed to the committee that drew up the bill. On 28 March 1681, before the bill could be read a second time in the Commons, the king called the houses together and dissolved the parliament.<br>
<br>Wharton was not named among the suspects in the Rye House Plot of 1683&#151;an alleged conspiracy to assassinate the king and the duke of York&#151;and he took no part in the consults that doomed William, Lord Russell, the earl of Essex, and Algernon Sidney. Nevertheless the king's agents searched Winchendon for arms in the post plot investigations. They found enough weapons and armour to equip about eight cavalrymen, and they deposited the collection at the White Hart inn in Aylesbury. Wharton complained to the earl of Bridgewater, lord lieutenant of the county: &#145;I must leave it to your Lordship whether such a proportion be not convenient for me and necessary for the security of my family&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 81, fol. 726). To Bridgewater, a wealthy landowner like Wharton, the collection seemed unremarkable.<h2>
<a name="Scandals"></a>Scandals</h2>One night in June 1682 Wharton and his brother Henry and two or three friends were entertained by a gentleman named Bray in the village of Great Barrington in Gloucestershire. After several hours of drinking the frolicsome group broke into St Mary's parish church. There they rang the bells, cut the bell ropes, broke the cover of the font and the desk of the pulpit, and ripped the church <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Then, as the actions (to paraphrase Wharton's later apology) grew worse in the execution than they had been in the design, the revellers relieved themselves in the church. They might have contrived other enormities if the clangour of the bells had not brought out an unamused crowd of villagers, who chased them back to Bray House. Besides committing sacrilege Wharton had perpetrated an indelible political error (which the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life</span> never mentions). He had made himself a permanent target for tory pamphleteers. In mid-August, before official action was taken, Wharton wisely threw himself upon the mercy of Robert Frampton, bishop of Gloucester. In a letter of 15 August he wrote an abject apology for his drunken escapade. Although he was confident that the faults were not so gross as they appeared in &#145;the prodigious story&#146; that had grown up since the event he would not deny the truth of any particular allegation. His present concern was to confess how sensible he was of his faults and submit himself entirely to the bishop's judgment. The letter was carried to Frampton by the eminently respectable John Cary, who vouched for its sincerity. Wharton, he explained, was the son of the pious Lord Wharton and was himself &#145;a man of very great parts [abilities] and estates&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 35, fol. 73).<br>
<br>On both Christian and prudential grounds Frampton decided that Tom Wharton should not be turned into &#145;a downright enemy&#146; but allowed to redeem himself with a suitable penance. From the sinners he demanded a formal letter of apology, a public confession, a fine of 50 guineas in commutation of penance, and payment for the damages at Barrington. Wharton duly wrote the required letter, and the brothers appeared before the bishop at Stow on the Wold, where they paid their fine and begged pardon for their offence before three clergymen and three laymen. Pleased with their repentance (and their promptness in advancing money for the repairs at Barrington) Frampton returned to them 10 of the 50 guineas; the other 40 he gave &#145;in their presence&#146; towards the renovation of Stow church  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 35, fol. 111). He dismissed the pair with &#145;wholesome admonitions&#146;  (ibid.). These he followed with a letter reminding Wharton of his sins, for which Wharton thanked him and again apologized.<br>
<br>Officially the affair was closed after Archbishop Sancroft had reviewed and approved Frampton's follow-up reports of January and February 1683. Unofficially Wharton's punishment had only begun. The story grew more outrageous with retelling. In December 1705 Wharton (then Lord Wharton) was silenced by the story during a debate in the Lords. After baiting the tories on their politic fears that the church was in danger under a low-church government Wharton made the mistake of asking, rhetorically, just who they feared. The duke of Leeds (formerly Danby) gave a quick reply: &#145;If there were any that had pissed against a communion table or done his other occasions in the pulpit, he should not think himself safe in such hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 5.242). By January 1711 Jonathan Swift, writing for the tory <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, had moved the episode from Barrington to Gloucester Cathedral and raised the fine from 50 guineas to &pound;1000. Wharton's friends, however, were inclined to ignore or shrug off the event. Sir Ralph Verney, for example, found Tom readily forgivable. In explaining why he supported Wharton in the 1685 election for knight of the shire he declared: &#145;I am confident that he will serve the King and the country faithfully, though he is wild enough in drink and I am troubled at it, but who lives without great faults&#146;  (BL, Verney MS M 636/39, 2 March 1685).<br>
<br>While Wharton was scandalizing the social world he and Anne were also having difficulties. From 1680 Anne had been experiencing seizures and in March 1681 she went to France seeking better health. In April, fearing she would not recover, she wrote to Tom, &#145;Goodbye, my Dear, Best Dear. Pardon me that I say no more, for I am so very ill I can hardly hold the pen or know what I write&#146;  (Cumbria AS, Carlisle, Lonsdale MS D/Lons/L1/4, 20 April 1681). In June Wharton went to Paris, but their brief reunion brought an emotional crisis. Anne was conscious of a distance between them and, as she tried to explain later, she found it difficult to express herself. When Tom said at parting that he &#145;loved nothing so well&#146; as her, she did not quite believe him, and she could not reply  (ibid., 2 July 1681).<br>
<br>When Anne returned from France the gulf between the couple widened temporarily because of what Goodwin called their &#145;mutual jealousies&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 20006, 308). Anne probably found herself facing a serious rival&#151;Wharton's mistress, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1661, <i>d</i>. in or after 1689), daughter of Sir Edward Dering, second baronet; while Wharton found himself competing with his brother Goodwin and his friend John Grobham (Jack) Howe. In early December 1682 Gilbert Burnet, later Bishop Burnet (a friend and political ally of the Whartons), tried to intervene. His enquiries and lectures brought a sharp rebuke from Anne, who told him not to believe gossip and to mind his own business. After this crisis the damage to the Wharton marriage was, for a time, largely repaired. By May 1683 the pair were back at Winchendon, Anne was lending Sir Ralph Verney one of her she-asses to provide milk for his health, and on 21 May Anne and Tom dined with the Verneys at Middle Claydon. They soon moved from Chelsea to one of the residences in the new and fashionable Soho Square.<h2>
<a name="Changingfortunes16851688"></a>Changing fortunes, 1685&#150;1688</h2>In late June 1685 Anne became ill again. At first the malady did not seem dangerous&#151;merely another episode in what Sir Ralph Verney called &#145;the colic&#146;. Attended by Dr Richard Lower and &#145;two or three doctors from Oxford&#146;, she seemed, in Sir Ralph's judgement, to be in more peril from the medicine than from the disease  (BL, Verney MS M 636/40, 20 June 1685). About 12 August she went from Winchendon to Adderbury to stay with her grandmother and to drink Astrop waters. Wharton, meanwhile, had gone to Tunbridge Wells some time in July. There he was joined by his mistress, Jane Dering, and his brother Henry. Jane did not live openly as Wharton's mistress but the liaison between the pair was well known. On 16 August John Verney reported their presence at Tunbridge Wells to his father. &#145;Tom Wharton is here&#146;, he wrote, &#145;and so is Mrs. Dering, though I hear Mrs. Wharton is not yet well&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>When Wharton returned from Tunbridge Wells in time for the races at Quainton on 26 August Anne's condition still seemed hopeful, but then she took a sudden turn for the worse. On 2 September John Cary reported from Adderbury that Anne lay &#145;very weak and ill&#146;, attended &#145;most diligently&#146; by the famous Dr John Radcliffe. On 6 September Sir Ralph wrote that he was much afraid for her: &#145;Yesterday she lay in great pains and convulsions&#146;  (BL, Verney MS M 636/40). Finally, on 29 October, Anne died.<br>
<br>Wharton brought her body home for burial in the church at Winchendon. As a tribute to a beloved lady a great throng turned out for the funeral, held on the evening of 10 November. Anne was buried in silk rather than the woollen required by English law. For this last nicety Wharton paid a fine of 50<i>s</i>., which was distributed among the poor of the parish.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the general election of 1685 had gone badly for the whigs. Wharton's two brothers Henry and William were defeated in normally safe boroughs, and Wharton himself was obliged to stand with the moderate tory John Egerton, Viscount Brackley, rather than his former colleague Richard Hampden&#151;and to expend about &pound;3000. Despite the election being moved to Newport Pagnell, Wharton's supporters turned out in overwhelming force and he was one of the few whigs who survived the tory landslide of that year. Wharton and the handful of other exclusionists in the new House of Commons were too few and too wise to oppose the torrent of court measures.<br>
<br>Wharton was also too wise to take part in Monmouth's rebellion, apparently believing that after the long hysteria of plots and counterplots the nation was much readier for a breathing space than a civil war. In the words of <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life</span> (p. 28), &#145;He [Wharton] looked upon the Duke of Monmouth's attempt as chimerical, and he never had any thoughts of joining it on the foot of his rash invasion&#146;.<br>
<br>In the crucial parliamentary session of November 1685 (the last King James would meet) Wharton's position was drastically altered. Now a leader of the whigs by attrition he found himself in the strange position of supporting tories such as his old enemy Sir Edward Seymour, who opposed the king's attempts to retain the Catholic army officers he had employed and to maintain a sizeable standing army. Wharton agreed with the unspoken fear that a standing army officered by Catholics and perhaps helped by Louis XIV would be fatal to English protestantism.<br>
<br>Wharton spoke three times in the early debates, once to recommend a bill for making the militia more useful and twice to urge drastic cuts in the government's proposals for supply. His most important speech came, however, after the Commons had asked the king, in a tactfully worded address, to dismiss his Catholic officers, whose appointment in defiance of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, they said, set a dangerous precedent. The address enraged James. He returned a blistering reply, citing his own reputation for uprightness and berating the Commons for their lack of trust. &#145;But however you may proceed on your part&#146;, he concluded, &#145;I will be steady in all my promises I have made to you and be very just to my word in every one of my speeches&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 4.1386).<br>
<br>The king's reply stunned the house into silence for a time. Then Wharton, one of the first to recover, coolly &#145;moved that a day might be appointed to consider of his Majesty's answer to the address of this House, and named Friday next&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 253, fol. 58). When the House of Lords took up the argument and appointed a day to examine the king's speech James prorogued parliament and commenced aggressive measures to implement his pro-Catholic policies.<h2>
<a name="Revolutionandthejunto16881696"></a>Revolution and the junto, 1688&#150;1696</h2>In 1688 the assembling of troops for summer exercises at Hounslow Heath made it relatively easy for Wharton and his brother Henry (then a lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards and a captain in the duke of Norfolk's regiment of foot) to help assemble a &#145;Treason Club&#146; at the Rose tavern in Drury Lane&#151;a vital part of the army conspiracy against the king. Wharton's membership in this group and the plot to disintegrate the king's army during the revolution may be his greatest contribution to William's success&#151;even greater than his famous song &#145;Lilliburlero&#146;.<br>
<br>The song itself resulted from the king's appointment in 1687 of Richard Talbot, the Catholic earl of Tyrconnell, first as commander of the army in Ireland and then as lord deputy, replacing the Anglican Lord Clarendon. These appointments alarmed all Anglo-Irishmen; and the Whartons, who owned property in co. Carlow and co. Westmeath, had a special reason for concern. Confiscation might be just over the horizon. Thus Wharton was on the alert when the second appointment was announced, and he was inspired to some stanzas of doggerel verse that encapsulated the fears and scorn of the English. Composed from the point of view of an Irish peasant waiting anxiously for his hero, the song began:<blockquote>
<div>Ho brother Teague, doest hear the decree<br>
</div>
<div>Lilliburlero bullen a-la<br>
</div>
<div>That we shall have a new Debitie<br>
</div>
<div>Lilliburlero bullen a-la<br>
</div>
</blockquote>After several verses of comment upon Talbot and the new order, which would bring the Irish &#145;commissions gillore&#146; and hang the English and their &#145;Magno Carto&#146;, the song ended triumphantly:<blockquote>
<div>Now, now de heretics all go down<br>
</div>
<div>Lilliburlero bullen a-la<br>
</div>
<div>By Chreish and St. Patrick the nation's our own<br>
</div>
<div>Lilliburlero bullen a-la<br>
</div>
<div>Lero, lero, lero, lero<br>
</div>
<div>Lilliburlero bullen a-la<br>
</div>
<div>Lero, lero, lero, lero<br>
</div>
<div>Lilliburlero bullen a-la<br>
</div> (Carswell, 354&#150;5)</blockquote>What the pseudo-Irish refrain lacked in sense it made up for in rhythm. English armies would march to it for years. For the time being, however, Wharton's verses merely smouldered. It was not until autumn 1688, after fears of Irish troops had risen several degrees, that &#145;Lilliburlero&#146; swept the army and the country  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.336). It would help, as Wharton later boasted, to drive King James out of three kingdoms.<br>
<br>Wharton was credited by White Kennett with having written the draft of the invitation to William of Orange, but this is highly unlikely. The conspirators, who included Bishop Compton, the earl of Danby, and the earl of Shrewsbury, needed no help in composing the letter, which is in Henry Sidney's handwriting. That Wharton was in close touch with Danby is very probable. He and his army friends were meeting at the Rose tavern during the period, and in early October he was conferring in Yorkshire with Danby and the earl of Devonshire, who would lead risings in the north. He was also receiving letters from the prince via one Joseph Flight. More important than communications, however, was the success of the Treason Club in persuading four of Colonel Langston's officers to join him in delivering their regiment to the prince of Orange. This operation, described years later by the Jacobite Colonel Ambrose Norton, was completed on 12 November 1688. It was the first major defection from the royal army, and although some of the troops returned it was the first of the shocks that eventually demoralized the king.<br>
<br>Wharton himself and his friend Lord Colchester, accompanied by a number of gentlemen and several life guards of Colchester's troop, were the first aristocrats to join the prince of Orange after his landing at Torbay. After arriving in Exeter on 10 November 1688 they were followed, a few days later, by Sir Edward Seymour and the earl of Abingdon. Henry Wharton, now in Lord Lichfield's regiment, stayed with the royal army at Salisbury until 24 November, when he went over to William, along with Prince George and the duke of Ormond. Goodwin Wharton, delayed by ambiguous revelations, did not join the prince until the army reached Henley.<br>
<br>In the Convention Parliament, Wharton insisted that the throne had become vacant when James fled to France. To the question of whether the king could be deposed Wharton answered that &#145;whether he may be deposed or deposes himself, he is not our King &hellip; for I believe not myself nor any Protestant in England safe if you admit him&#146;  (Grey, 9.11). After the Commons agreed that the throne was vacant Wharton went on the next day (29 January 1689) to nominate William and Mary as joint sovereigns&#151;a measure that after much debate in the Lords, who would have preferred a regency, was ultimately adopted by both houses.<br>
<br>After William and Mary accepted the crown Wharton was made a privy councillor (21 February) and comptroller of the household, a post which gave him apartments in Whitehall and Hampton Court with fees and allowances amounting to about &pound;1200. Lord Wharton was made a privy councillor and a groom of the stole. Henry, now knight of the shire for Westmorland, had been made colonel of his regiment when Lord Lichfield resigned, and Wharton was able to secure the post of cursitor baron in the court of exchequer for his lawyer brother-in-law William Carr.<br>
<br>In spite of these prizes and Wharton's later appointments on treaty and army commissions (10 May and 13 May), the year 1689 was grim for the Whartons. On 26 May Anne Carr, Wharton's older sister, died; and only three weeks later, on 17 June, less than three months after his appointment to the bench, William Carr died also. Most devastating to Wharton was the loss of his brother Henry&#151;Harry to his family and friends&#151;who died of the fever in Ireland. Their sister Mary, who was in London when the bad news arrived, reported to her husband, &#145;My poor brother [Tom] Wharton stole out of town this morning so melancholy as I never saw anybody&#146;  (NL Wales, Kemeys-Tynte MSS, fol. 152).<br>
<br>In December Wharton and his whig friends made difficulties by attacking the tory members of William's coalition government and by attempting to purge the tory MPs who had abetted Charles and James in attacking town charters. Moreover, on 25 December Wharton wrote a letter charging William with ingratitude towards the whigs, who had made him king. William's trimming policy, Wharton said, in effect, paralysed government and discouraged the king's real friends. This letter helps to explain some of Wharton's tactics through the next twenty-five years of partisan warfare.<br>
<br>In William's reign Wharton's conviction that tory ministers should be replaced by whigs accounts for his attack on the earl of Nottingham after the Smyrna fleet disaster and his exploitation of the East India bribery scandal to remove Sir John Trevor as speaker of the House of Commons and to wound the duke of Leeds. The demand for a disciplined, one party ministry also led to the formation of the famous <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92792', "whig junto")</script>. When the whigs were in power, the junto, leaders of the court whigs, served as a virtual cabinet&#151;a committee on strategy and tactics. When whigs were out of power the junto became a shadow cabinet, regrouping its forces and waiting for its opponents to make serious mistakes. Wharton was particularly valuable as a notable electioneer, a devoted party man, and, perhaps above all, a tireless worker. The overall impression derived from following Wharton session by session through the journals of the Commons and Lords and the associated batches of documents is that he worked diligently on a great variety of problems&#151;an impression confirmed by Richard Steele, who praised Wharton in a letter of 11 April 1713 for his competence over &#145;the whole compass of business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Steele</span>, 48). This praise was repeated in a <span class="italic">Spectator</span> dedicated to Wharton.<br>
<br>During the 1690s two important events in Wharton's personal life expanded his political power. The first of these was his marriage, in July 1692, to the Hon. Lucy (1669/70&#150;1717), daughter and sole heir of Adam Loftus, Viscount Lisburne in the Irish peerage. Lisburne, who had died in the Irish war, on 15 September 1691, left his daughter, then twenty-one, estates worth about &pound;5000 per year. They included Rathfarnham Castle in Ireland. The match between Wharton and Lucy, described by one of Tom's army friends as &#145;the witty fair one&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 79, fol. 420), seems to have been romantic. Goodwin, who saw the couple dancing together at a ball in Kensington Palace on 6 January 1692, called Lucy Tom's &#145;new mistress&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 20007, fol. 161). Eventually Lucy would be a toast of the whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73609', "Kit-Cat Club")</script> and the target of tory scandalmongers.<br>
<br>The other dramatic transformation in Wharton's life was the death, on 4 or 5 February 1696, of his father, at the age of eighty-two. Considering his precisianist convictions Lord Wharton had been indulgent with his free-living son. Wharton, in turn, admired his father. To the end of his life he would carry on Lord Wharton's campaign to expand and defend liberties for dissenters, though he later conformed to the Anglican church and explained to the House of Lords that he would &#145;live and die in the communion of it&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 1024, fol. 168).<h2>
<a name="LordWharton16961710"></a>Lord Wharton, 1696&#150;1710</h2>Lord Wharton's death placed his son, now fifth Baron Wharton, in the House of Lords (on 24 February) and added considerably to his social prestige. &#145;Lord Wharton&#146; was a great deal more dignified than Tom or Honest Tom (a name derived from Wharton's frequent description of whigs as the honest party, as opposed to the hypocritical tories). The promotion also placed Wharton in the house where the king's ministers ordinarily sat and where final decisions were made on vital measures. Finally, Lord Wharton's death raised his son's income to about &pound;8000 a year, which, along with his new wife's patrimony, enabled him to expand his interest among the electors. In good years for whigs he could win about twenty seats, but in bad years he might be reduced to a handful.<br>
<br>The year 1698 brought a marked shift in the political wind. Wharton was not made secretary of state nor a member of the commission for governing Ireland as he and his friends hoped he might be. William softened the blow by offering him the Spanish embassy, which Wharton declined, and he had to remain satisfied with his appointments (23 April 1697) as lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire and chief justice in eyre and warden of the royal forests south of the Trent. After nine years of war, moreover, the country was tired of taxes, large armies, and foreigners and in the 1698 elections court whigs lost control of the Commons. Wharton himself was able to win only about half of his elections. His candidates were even defeated in Oxfordshire, despite his lord lieutenantcy. Although Wharton retained his own appointments and continued to carry William's messages to the House of Lords, his junto friends were gradually replaced in government positions by tories and country whigs.<br>
<br>On 24 December 1698 Wharton's family, if not his political, fortunes seemed to improve when Lucy had a son, whom they named Philip [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29171/', "Wharton, Philip")</script>] after his grandfather. They later had two daughters, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1706) and Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1710). King William and the duke of Shrewsbury were Philip's godfathers at the baptism on 5 January, and Princess Anne (later Queen Anne) was the boy's godmother. A month later Wharton's favourite sister, Mary Kemeys, saw her brother, her sister-in-law, and the baby in their new residence on Gerrard Street. The boy, Mary reported, was a &#145;very lusty child&#146; and the lady &#145;very fond&#146; of him, but, despite now having an heir, her brother, though &#145;extreme kind&#146;, seemed &#145;melancholy&#146;. Before her visit, he said, he had not been up to the nursery for a week  (NL Wales, Kemeys-Tynte MSS, fol. 325). Had Wharton been able to foresee the career of Philip (later the duke of Wharton) he would have suffered something more severe than melancholy.<br>
<br>About this time John Macky, an agent for William, gave a thumbnail sketch of Wharton. At the age of fifty, Macky says, Lord Wharton is of &#145;middle stature&#146; and &#145;fair complexion&#146;. He is &#145;certainly one of the completest gentlemen in England, hath a very clear understanding, and manly expressions, with abundance of wit. He is brave in his person [and] much of a libertine&#146;. King William, Macky wrote, thought him too popular, too much a republican, and too bold in censuring court measures to hold an administrative office  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 91&#150;2).<br>
<br>When Anne took the throne in March 1702 Wharton was dismissed from his post as comptroller, from his other offices, and even from the privy council. Anne, a devoted churchwoman, installed a tory government headed by Lord Treasurer Godolphin and supported by a tory House of Commons. Wharton and his whig friends, now on the defensive, supported the renewed war with France, but they were hard pressed to keep the tories from passing a bill against occasional conformity. With a large whig presence in the Lords and good organization Wharton's troops managed to defeat the measure twice&#151;once with an amendment and once with a quick vote of rejection. Wharton also involved the houses in a jurisdictional dispute in the famous case of <i>Ashby v. White</i>. He financed the whig voter Ashby, who had been struck off the rolls by the tory officials of Aylesbury, to argue his case that an individual's right to vote was cognizable before the courts and ultimately the Lords, rather than before the Commons, who claimed the sole right of judging elections.<br>
<br>With his ally Lord Somers, Wharton played a major role in producing the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>, which set up the mechanism for installing the Hanoverian successor and which inspired a letter, in French, from Wharton to the future George I. Wharton also helped to formulate the legislation that led to the union with Scotland. The latter achievement earned him an honorary LLD from Cambridge (16 April 1705), an appointment as a commissioner for the union treaty (10 April 1706), reappointment to the post of chief justice in eyre (9 September 1706), and a promotion in the peerage. He became Viscount Winchendon and earl of Wharton on 23 December 1706.<br>
<br>The election victories in 1705 (said by <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life</span> to have cost Wharton &pound;12,000) and the unflagging support which junto whigs gave to the war on the continent convinced Wharton and his allies that they had earned major offices in the government. The process, aided by another election victory in 1708, was slow and tortuous, but eventually the earl of Sunderland became secretary of state, Lord Somers became lord president, and Wharton, on 4 December 1708, became lord lieutenant of Ireland. He appointed Joseph Addison as his secretary and found safe seats for him at Lostwithiel and later at Malmesbury.<br>
<br>Wharton began his lieutenancy by calming churchmen, who feared he might try to repeal the Irish <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. In a series of meetings with Irish MPs and lords he set about reducing tensions and animosities. When he opened the session he promised that the test would not be disturbed. He hoped, however, that the heavily outnumbered protestants could unite in the face of common dangers and that churchmen would find methods of relieving &#145;the uneasiness&#146; of dissenters  (JHC, <span class="italic">Ireland</span>, 21 vols., 1763&#150;81, 3.566&#150;7). Military supply bills were passed without difficulty. In the wake of the foiled attack on Scotland by James Francis Edward Stuart (the Pretender) the previous year, Anglo-Irishmen were happy to finance regiments and arsenals. As a further deterrent to the growth of popery, they also passed a bill providing that estates of Irish Catholics should descend to their protestant heirs. They also agreed with Wharton's proposal to settle in Ireland 500 families of protestant refugees from the Palatinate.<br>
<br>Wharton was a hard-working lord lieutenant, as his correspondence with the English government shows. He was also assiduous in filling vacancies with whigs&#151;a policy that would bring heavy fire from the tories. For himself he acquired a regiment of dragoons. His greatest mistake in distributing favours was his failure to select Jonathan Swift, then a whig, as his chaplain. Instead he chose Dr Ralph Lambert, who was shortly appointed dean of Derry. Had Wharton fastened the great satirist to the whig establishment he might have deprived Robert Harley's government of its finest propagandist and saved himself many lashes.<br>
<br>Wharton's greatest short-term mistake was his active part in the impeachment and trial of Dr Henry Sacheverell, whose attack upon Lord Treasurer Godolphin, toleration, occasional conformity, and (by implication) the revolution brought charges of seditious libel. The affair ended in a famous contest before the House of Lords. Frankly discarding the warming-pan theory, Wharton stoutly defended the whig version of the revolution, as a preservation of the constitution against invasions by arbitrary (and popish) royal power. Widely perceived as a whig attack on the Church of England the crisis brought out London mobs, who sacked meeting-houses and threatened Wharton's town house in Dover Street. In the election of September 1710 the whigs, in spite of Wharton's exertions, lost control of the Commons, helping Wharton's inveterate enemy, Robert Harley, strengthen his hold on the government.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>In October 1710 Wharton was removed as lord lieutenant, and on 11 January 1711 his regiment was disbanded. Meanwhile Swift began an assault on Wharton's character and his administration in Ireland. In the tory <span class="italic">Examiner</span> of 30 November 1710 and in <span class="italic">A Short Character of His Ex. T. E. of W.</span> (published anonymously and without imprint in December 1710) Swift pictured Wharton as a hardened, greedy politician, bawdy and profane, whose corrupt addiction to wealth and pleasure had cost Ireland dearly. On its title-page the 1711 edition of the <span class="italic">Short Character</span> described itself as a forerunner of impeachment.<br>
<br>Swift's anonymous attack brought him an oblique reprimand from Archbishop William King, who (without overtly accusing Swift of authorship) condemned the pamphlet as unchristian and unjust. The threat of impeachment also met opposition and soon evaporated. On 11 January 1711 Addison wrote that he heard &#145;no more of the impeachment&#146;. He supposed that Swift's &#145;scurrilous little book&#146; would never have been written if Harley's government had been able to proceed  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 253&#150;4). Whatever profits Wharton made during his governorship (in addition to his salary of &pound;12,000 and expense allowances of &pound;3000) they fell within the then recognized rules of the political game. This was also found to be true in 1713 when Wharton was charged with having used his influence to get a place in the English customs for George Hutchinson, who paid him &pound;1000. When the debates revealed that the money had been given to Wharton's needy sister Lady Lockhart and that the event had occurred before the general pardon of 1709 the charges were dropped.<br>
<br>In autumn 1711 Wharton and his friends began a campaign against the government's peace proposals. In preparation for their counter-offensive the Kit-Cat Club planned a demonstration for Queen Elizabeth's birthday on 17 November&#151;a procession and pope-burning in the style of 1680. For the occasion they prepared elaborate effigies of the pope, the Pretender, and the devil. A nervous government forbade the demonstration and confiscated the effigies, triggering a memorable line from Wharton. When asked what had happened to the three bogeymen, he answered, &#145;merrily&#146;, &#145;Their Disciples came by night and stole them away&#146;  (Oldmixon, <span class="italic">History</span>, 478).<br>
<br>To block the peace Wharton made an agreement with his old opponent the high tory earl of Nottingham. The junto whigs would support a bill against occasional conformity if Nottingham's friends in the Lords would vote against the peace. They would abandon their dissenting clients, at least temporarily, in order to prevent a potentially ruinous agreement with France. Both parties delivered on their promises, and on 8 December a majority of Lords agreed to a &#145;no peace without Spain&#146; clause in an address to the queen  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 19.339).<br>
<br>In a historic manoeuvre the queen thwarted the whig stratagem by creating twelve new peers, introduced in the house on 2 January 1712. The so-called tory dozen evoked another celebrated remark from Wharton, who asked one of the new members &#145;whether they voted by their foreman&#146;  (Boyer, <span class="italic">History</span>, 533). But Wharton's wit could not alter the new balance of power and in the end the whigs managed to defeat only the commercial clauses of the peace treaty. In the general election of 1713 Wharton was hard pressed to find seats for some of the whig leaders in the Commons, and his candidates lost the county election at Aylesbury, traditionally his home grounds. He and Lady Wharton appeared there with wool in their hats, symbolizing whig devotion to the English wool trade; but Lord Cheyne's nominees, John Fleetwood and John Verney, Viscount Fermanagh, prevailed.<br>
<br>Wharton then appears to have supported a whig proposal to dissolve the union in order to embarrass the government and win Scottish votes, although he was absent when the vote was taken and the measure was defeated. Wharton was defeated also, during the 1714 session, when he attacked the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span>, a tory measure which closed the schools of the dissenters. His final speech, however, as he flayed Harley (now earl of Oxford), who had been raised and educated, like himself, as a dissenter, was perhaps the most incisive of his long career, and his closing reminder to the bishops of the gospel's &#145;do unto others&#146; was brilliant  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 6.1351&#150;2).<br>
<br>During the 1714 session Wharton hammered away at the succession in danger theme. A formal motion, that the succession was not safe under the present government, was defeated in the Lords by only 12 votes, prompting Wharton to remark &#145;you carried it by your dozen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 366). When Queen Anne died and the <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> went into effect Wharton was not among the regents named by George I&#151;an omission perhaps designed to conciliate tories. He was singled out, however, for special attention when George arrived in Greenwich on 19 September 1714; and on 23 September he was appointed lord privy seal and made a member of the privy council. Of his many activities over the next few months by far the most important was his work on the elections of January and February. In Buckinghamshire Wharton and Lord Cheyne agreed to return one tory, Fleetwood, and one whig, John Hampden, in the county election, to save the expense of a contest; overall a solid whig majority was returned. On 15 February 1715 Wharton was created marquess of Wharton and of Malmesbury, and on 28 February he was granted a pension of &pound;2000 a year. He was also made baron of Trim, earl of Rathfarnham, and marquess of Catherlough in the Irish peerage, but the patent for this title was not issued until 12 April, too late for Wharton to see.<br>
<br>In early April Wharton became ill. His condition, according to Dr Hans Sloane, who attended him, &#145;proceeded in a great measure from the attendance he gave to a multiplicity of business he was engaged in&#146;&#151;from &#145;fatigue&#146; of body and mind  (BL, Sloane MS 222, fol. 77). There was an additional complication. On 2 March Wharton's son Philip, then sixteen, had eloped with Martha, daughter of General Richard Holmes. Wharton tried vainly to have the marriage annulled, and his anger may have aggravated his illness. In any event he made his will on 8 April. On 12 April 1715, at his house on Dover Street, he died. On 22 April he was buried in the church at Winchendon. His widow, who died on 5 February 1717, was also buried there.<br>
<br>On the day of Wharton's death the duchess of Marlborough, informed by Dr Samuel Garth that &#145;Lord Wharton is given over&#146;, wrote a short testimony to his political value: &#145;I should be very sorry for his death, having never in my whole life seen so useful a man as he was in the Parliament, and so constantly right in all things that concerned the true interests of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough</span>, 1875, 117&#150;18). This statement might be called the standard whig version of Wharton's career. As a leader in the &#145;glorious revolution&#146;, a zealous defender of toleration, and a promoter of the protestant succession, he was one of the &#145;patriots&#146; who had helped save England from popery and arbitrary power and the established church from suicidal high-church doctrines.<br>
<br>In view of Wharton's political rectitude whigs found it easy to ignore or excuse his lapses from strict moral virtue. His sexual adventures the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life</span> (p. 21) could dismiss as &#145;youthful sallies&#146; and they could be blamed upon the debauched court of Charles II, where Wharton had once been welcome. Tory charges of political lying and corruption were simply slander, the malice of a desperate party, and tributes to Wharton's effectiveness as a whig leader.<br>
<br>Two days after Wharton's death Thomas Hearne delivered a tory verdict on his career, describing him as &#145;another great atheistical, knavish, republican, Whiggish Villain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne</span>, ed. D. W. Rannie, 1901, 5.45). This view was echoed, with variations, by Ned Ward in <span class="italic">The Lord Whiglove's Elegy</span> (1715) and by various tory wits. It received its final expression years later from Jonathan Swift, who dismissed his old enemy as &#145;the most universal villain I ever knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 92).<br>
<br>Wharton never analysed his own career, and Swift asserted that he was totally indifferent to posthumous fame. It seems obvious, however, that Wharton had good reason to be satisfied. The party he had helped to construct and hold together, in good times and bad, had triumphed. The time, energy, and money he had devoted to the cause had been well spent. He had been damnably mauled by tory pamphleteers, of course, but that was a small price to pay for victory.<br>
