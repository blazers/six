<span class="headword">Bell,  Robert Anning</span>  (1863&#150;1933), <span class="occ">artist and designer</span>, was born at 1 Little Street, Andrew Street, St Giles, London, on 14 April 1863, the son of Robert George Bell, a cheesemonger, and his wife, Mary Charlotte Knight. He received his early education at University College School, but left at the age of fourteen because of straitened family circumstances, and was then articled in the architectural office of his uncle. He thus acquired considerable skills as a draughtsman through detailing architectural drawings. Subsequently he studied under Professor Fred Brown at the Westminster School of Art and at the Royal Academy Schools, following these studies with a year in Paris under the tuition of M. Aim&eacute; Morot. On his return he shared a studio at 98A Warner Road, Camberwell, with George Frampton where they experimented with a form of low-relief painted plaster sculpture inspired by the work of the Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia. The influence of Italian art was paramount, particularly the woodblock illustrations from the <span class="italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</span> by Francesco Colonna, issued in Venice in 1499 as a guide to artists and republished as the <span class="italic">Dream of Poliphilus</span> (by J. W. Appel) by the Department of Science and Art in 1893. It was further reinforced by extensive travel throughout Europe, including Italy. These travels were partly financed by a generous gift from the purchaser of one of Bell's half-crown watercolour pot-boilers which he produced in the studio as a means of earning a living.<br>
<br>The newly formed Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society gave Bell an early opportunity to display his talent working in the applied arts. In 1889 and 1890 he exhibited various designs for an altarpiece comprising low-relief sculptural panels and paintings carried out in association with his studio partner Frampton. These were later installed in the Roman Catholic church of St Clare, Liverpool. These designs marked the start of a long association with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. He showed regularly with the group, in exhibitions at home and abroad, notably at Turin in 1902, where he served on the hanging committee with Walter Crane and W. A. S. Benson. The society was itself an offshoot of the Art-Workers' Guild to which Bell was elected in 1891, remaining a member throughout his life: he was appointed master in 1921. The <span class="italic">Studio</span>, an influential monthly art magazine which espoused the arts and crafts movement and progressive contemporary arts generally, began publication in 1893. From its inception it gave Bell favoured treatment: the first issue illustrated four of his ex-libris bookplates, and the second contained a photograph of his plaster relief panel <span class="italic">Harvest</span> (1890), using it as a frontispiece, together with other illustrations of bas-relief decorations by him. Subsequent issues showed numerous book illustrations, ex-libris designs, and plaster reliefs.<br>
<br>The arrangement of sharing a studio with George Frampton ended in 1895 when Bell at the age of thirty-two was appointed instructor at Liverpool University school of architecture, a position he held until 1899. By this time he had already achieved a considerable reputation particularly in the field of the decorative arts. At the end of 1893 Harold Rathbone had established the Della Robbia pottery in Birkenhead which, as the name suggests, shared its source of inspiration with Bell. From the pottery's inception Bell was associated with it, designing its trade-mark galleon motif and providing designs for ceramic relief panels.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, Amy Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ditcham, whom he had married on 8 September 1900, Bell married on 15 August 1914 Laure Caroline Richard 
    (formerly Richard-Troncy; 1867&#150;1950)
  , a French-born divorcee. She studied art in Paris and at the Slade School under Legros, and later exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Paris Salon where she was awarded medals in 1913 and 1920.<br>
<br>From the mid-1890s onwards Bell became increasingly successful as a book designer and illustrator. The subjects chosen were usually from literary sources including fairy tales, works by the romantic poets, and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His illustrations from Shakespeare were particularly distinctive: those for <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> (1901) are widely regarded as among his finest. His distinctive style, characterized by dreaming maidens in a setting of symbolist swirls, was redolent of the emerging European art nouveau movement. He was greatly admired and secured important commissions in France and Spain where his first biography was written and published in 1910.<br>
<br>Public commissions played an increasingly important role in Bell's work, and to accommodate the necessary practicalities he extended his range of skills to include mosaic and stained glass. Commissions included designs for a mosaic on the fa&ccedil;ade of the Horniman Museum at Dulwich, the tympanum over the west door of Westminster Cathedral, and also the altarpiece in the lady chapel. He carried out important works over several years at the Palace of Westminster, including two of the four patron saints in the octagon hall; all these works were carried out in mosaic by workmen trained by Bell.<br>
<br>At no stage in his career did Bell neglect painting either in oil or watercolour. He exhibited his first painting at the Royal Academy in 1885; but it was not until 1914, when he was elected an associate member, that he began to exhibit there regularly. From then onwards he showed annually until his death; he was elected a Royal Academician in 1922. From 1888 until 1901 he showed at the New English Art Club, both paintings and coloured plaster reliefs. In 1901 he was invited to become an associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours (the Old Watercolour Society) and he was elected a member three years later; in that time he exhibited twenty-nine works. During that period watercolours became Bell's principal form of expression, and he wrote enthusiastically about the merits of the watercolour medium, which he prized above all others, in the second annual volume of the <span class="italic">Old Water-Colour Society's Club</span>. The Tate collection has four of his works, three of which are watercolours; several others are in provincial and foreign galleries. Nearly all Bell's work is figurative; <span class="italic">The Battle of Flowers</span>, his diploma work for the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, is a particularly ambitious composition with many figures. It is described by his Spanish biographer, Alejandro Riquier, as &#145;a poem, a poem of life, of colour and of line&#146;  (Erskine, 55).<br>
<br>After his departure from Liverpool, and throughout his life, Bell maintained an interest in his work, giving lectures and writing articles. In 1911 he took up teaching again at Glasgow School of Art where he was appointed chief of the design section. In 1918 he was appointed professor of design at the Royal College of Art, a post he held until 1924. In the year following his death at 28 Holland Park Road, London, on 27 November 1933 a memorial exhibition of Bell's work was held at the Fine Art Society. Bell epitomized the arts and crafts ideal, in which movement he was a central figure. He was master of many skills and excelled in all the diverse fields he undertook. In his own lifetime Bell received a good measure of popular as well as critical appreciation for his prolific and varied work, particularly his many public commissions mainly executed in mosaic and stained glass. These showed a versatility which one obituarist compared to &#145;the great artists of the Renaissance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Nov 1933). Writing about his work as a painter, T. Martin Wood also perceived in his work &#145;the issues of the Italian Renaissance &hellip; its ability to revive in art remote experiences which have passed into its veins&#146;  (Wood, 256). After the memorial exhibition at the Fine Art Society in 1934, Bell's reputation languished until 1989 when fifteen of his works were included in the exhibition &#145;The Last Romantics&#146; held at the Barbican Art Gallery, London. The exhibition catalogue refers to Bell's &#145;mastery of so many art forms [which] brought him numerous duties and honours&#146;  (Christian, 155).<br>
