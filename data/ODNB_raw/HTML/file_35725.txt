<span class="headword">Rendel, Sir  Alexander Meadows</span>  (1829&#150;1918), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Plymouth, on 3 April 1829, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23364/', "James Meadows Rendel (1799&#150;1856)")</script> and Catherine Jane Harris (1797&#150;1884). He was educated at Kings School, Canterbury, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read divinity and mathematics. It was originally intended he should enter the church but, following his younger brother Lewis's death in 1851 while engaged upon work at Holyhead, Rendel joined his father's civil engineering firm, based in London. The following year his father was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers. The younger Rendel subsequently spent some time on major works at Leith docks and the Portland harbour of refuge, gaining valuable experience. In 1853 he married Eliza Hobson (1835&#150;1915), daughter of Captain William Hobson RN, the first governor-general of New Zealand; they had nine children. They lived initially at 44 Lancaster Gate, London, and later acquired a splendid country residence, Rickettswood, near Charlwood, Surrey.<br>
<br>On their father's death in 1856 it was decided that Rendel and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35726/', "George Wightwick Rendel")</script> should carry on the business, but due to their limited experience the Admiralty appointed new consulting engineers for the great works outstanding at Holyhead, Portland, and in South Africa. In 1857, due to the intervention of their father's friend, W. G. Armstrong (1810&#150;1900), and Robert Stephenson (1803&#150;1859), Alexander was appointed to succeed his father as consulting engineer to the East Indian Railway. His position was further strengthened by his friendship with Sir Richard Strachey (1817&#150;1908), formerly secretary to Lord Dalhousie, the Indian governor-general and later chairman of the East Indian Railway Company.<br>
<br>In spite of the upheaval caused by the Indian mutiny in 1857, Rendel visited India in order to become acquainted with local conditions, in particular to examine the problems of crossing the Hooghly River between Calcutta and the railway terminus at Howrah. During the next twenty years he was responsible for the construction of many thousands of miles of railway and for bridging many of the great Indian rivers, notably the Upper Son Bridge of Patna, the Alexandra Bridge over the Chenab, the Lansdowne Bridge over the Indus at Sukkur, the Hardinge Bridge over the Ganges, and the Empress Bridge over the Sutlej. He was knighted in 1887. Rendel was also consulting engineer to the strategically important Uganda Railway, reaching Lake Victoria ahead of the German competition. Other notable railway projects were the Egyptian Light Delta Railway and the Mexican Railway. Docks designed by him included those at Kirkcaldy, Llanelli, Milford, and Workington.<br>
<br>In 1894 Rendel's second son became a partner, but he died in 1898. He was succeeded by his youngest brother, who after two years joined his uncle George Wightwick Rendel at Armstrong's Pozzuoli works in Italy. During the same year Frederick Ewart Robertson, formerly chief engineer with the East Indian Railway, entered the partnership and the name of the firm changed to Sir Alexander M. Rendel &amp; Co. Robertson died in 1912 and was replaced by Seymour Briscoe Tritton (1860&#150;1937), a mechanical engineer who had been a key figure in the firm for many years. However, doubts existed in Rendel's mind as to whether a mechanical engineer would be acceptable to the East Indian Railway as his successor, and in 1913 Frederick Palmer (1862&#150;1934), chief engineer to the Port of London Authority, joined the partnership. He had succeeded Robertson as the East Indian's chief engineer and was closely associated with the development of the Calcutta docks. The name of the firm was changed to Rendel, Palmer, and Tritton, and it was closely involved in development of the Port of London and especially construction of the King George V Dock, opened in 1921. Rendel died on 23 January 1918, at 51 Gordon Square, London. At the time of his death he was working on the design of the new Lower Sone Bridge.<br>
