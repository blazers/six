<span class="headword">Calvert,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1631, <em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was baptized at Allhallows Pavement, York, on 23 May 1631, the eldest son and second of the nine children of Robert Calvert, merchant and sheriff of York, and his wife, Judith Taylor. He was named after his grandfather, James Calvert. His uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4427/', "Thomas Calvert (1605/6&#150;1679)")</script>, the York presbyterian minister and Hebraist in whose footsteps Calvert would follow. Calvert was admitted pensioner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 9 June 1646. He graduated BA in 1650 and proceeded MA in 1653. He was appointed vicar of Boynton, Yorkshire, on 20 July 1652, curate of Kirkdale on 30 May 1654, and vicar of Topcliffe on 12 March 1656, from which post he had resigned by 26 March 1661, when his successor was installed. After his resignation Calvert may have supported himself through commerce: he was identified as a &#145;merchant&#146; when he was admitted to the freedom of the city of York in 1664. According to Calamy, Calvert &#145;lived privately but not idly; for he studied hard&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.472). He was licensed to preach as a presbyterian at his house in York on 25 July 1672.<br>
<br>Calvert was a moderate presbyterian who maintained good relations with some Anglicans, including his cousin Thomas Harrison, a fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, to whom Calvert left most of his library of books and manuscripts. Calvert's one publication, <span class="italic">Napthali</span> (1672), a Latin work on the ten tribes of Israel and the conversion of the Jews, was dedicated to the bishop of Chester, John Wilkins. He waited on Wilkins in company with another York presbyterian minister, Peter Williams, at Scarborough-Spaw, when Wilkins received them cordially and expressed hopes for religious comprehension. A letter Calvert addressed to the Anglican Hebraist Dr John Lightfoot in August 1669 asked for assistance in interpreting the prophecy of Ezekiel. Calvert's interpretation of <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> 48 differed from mainstream Christian and Jewish prophetic interpretation in that he believed that the division of the Holy Land among the twelve tribes was a literal description of the situation after the end of the Babylonian captivity rather than an apocalyptic prophecy or an allegory. Thus, the supposedly &#145;lost&#146; ten tribes were not lost at all&#151;they had long ago returned to the Holy Land, either with the two tribes of Benjamin and Judah at the end of the Babylonian captivity or shortly thereafter, and presumably had simply been reabsorbed into the Jewish people.<br>
<br>Despite Calvert's friendships with individual Anglicans and the entreaties of conformists who admired his learning, he refused to conform because he continued to object to some aspects of the Anglican liturgy and because it would have required an episcopal reordination. About 1675 Calvert became a chaplain to Sir Thomas Strickland of Boynton, whose sons he also tutored. Calvert was not usually politically active but while at Boynton he became mixed up in the aftermath of the Rye House plot. Along with another member of Strickland's household, the gardener Marmaduke Baine, Calvert went to Bridlington in late June 1683 to arrange a boat to the Netherlands for the plotter Sir John Cochrane of Ochiltree and his son. Cochrane was the husband of Sir Thomas Strickland's sister. Calvert was charged with treason for the action and briefly imprisoned in York Castle, but the charge seems to have come to nothing. Sir Thomas Strickland seems to have approved of Calvert's actions&#151;in his will written that August he left him &pound;20.<br>
<br>Later Calvert moved to Hull, and afterwards became chaplain to Sir William Middleton, bt, of Belsay Castle, Northumberland, and tutor to Middleton's only son, John. Calvert died at Belsay Castle in December 1698, &#145;an ingenious and pious man, of a meek and quiet temper&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.472).<br>
