<span class="headword">Huggins <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Murray]</span>,  Margaret Lindsay</span>, Lady Huggins  (1848&#150;1915), <span class="occ">astronomical spectroscopist and photographer</span>, was born on 14 August 1848 at 23 Longford Terrace, Monkstown, co. Dublin, the second of the three children of John Majoribanks Murray (1822&#150;1893), a solicitor, and his first wife, Helen Lindsay (1826&#150;1857), the daughter of Robert Lindsay of Tiree, Scotland. Though John Murray had lived in Ireland since early childhood, he was of Scottish ancestry and received his education at Edinburgh Academy. Anecdotal sources credit Margaret's paternal grandfather, Robert Murray, chief officer of the Provincial Bank of Ireland in Dublin, with inspiring her interest in the stars during their many evening walks following the untimely death of her mother. She reportedly attended a private boarding-school in Brighton. As a young woman she developed considerable skill both as an illustrator and a photographer, which she ably employed in artistic and scientific projects throughout her life. In <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Life of Sir William Huggins</span> (1936), C. E. Mills and C. F. Brooke recount that she was first introduced to her future husband, the amateur astronomer and pioneer spectroscopist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34039/', "William Huggins (1824&#150;1910)")</script>, in London by mutual friends. Thanks to the mediation of the instrument maker Howard Grubb (1844&#150;1931), the two met again in Dublin during Huggins's visits to inspect Grubb's progress on the construction of a new telescope for the former's observatory located in his residence at 90 Upper Tulse Hill Road, Lambeth, London. The couple were married on 8 September 1875, in the parish church at Monkstown.<br>
<br>Acquaintances have suggested that Lady Huggins, as she became in 1897 when her husband was created KCB, had, from an early age, developed an interest in spectroscopy, even constructing her own spectroscope guided by an anonymous article in a popular periodical. Some have romantically, but erroneously, claimed that Sir William was the author of the article in question. However she came by her interest and knowledge of spectroscopy, following her marriage Margaret Huggins became involved in the work of the observatory. Her presence changed both the kind of work done at Tulse Hill and its organization. In particular, photography appeared as a new method of recording what had previously been purely visual spectroscopic observations. Although published articles about the early photographic accomplishments at Tulse Hill make no mention of her, evidence gleaned from the observatory's notebook entries, for which she assumed responsibility in March 1876, points to Margaret Huggins as a major impetus behind the establishment of her husband's successful programme of astronomical photography.<br>
<br>From the start Margaret Huggins exhibited a strong interest in experimental design&#151;improving and adapting both instruments and methods used at Tulse Hill to the new photographic tasks at hand. In June 1876 she described and illustrated her plan for a camera to convert the telescope previously dedicated to visual observation into one suitable for photography. She devoted months to experimentation with different types of photographic plates and designed a sighting-tube to ensure the alignment of the spectroscope with the telescope. Working as a team, the Hugginses moved quickly to the forefront of spectroscopic astrophotography, learning photography's limitations and moulding its capabilities to their agenda, which included photographing the spectra of stars, comets, and nebulae, and perfecting a method of photographing the solar corona without an eclipse.<br>
<br>Margaret Huggins appreciated the importance of spectroscopic information to the diligent observer. Photographs of a celestial object may expose the body's outward form to scientific scrutiny, but, &#145;if we can get good spectra&#146;, she wrote, &#145;we should have the soul&#146;  (M. L. Huggins, notebook 2, 4 Dec 1888, Margaret Clapp Library, Wellesley College). In 1888 the Hugginses focused their attention on the spectrum of the Orion nebula (M42) to determine the nature of the so-called chief nebular line, a green emission line that William had been the first to observe some years earlier in the spectra of several nebulae. His claim that it represented a new element was disputed, and it was with the hope of resolving this controversy in their favour that the Hugginses observed and photographed M42's spectrum between October 1888 and April 1889. These difficult observations, which required repeated direct comparison of the spectrum generated by burning magnesium against that produced by the faint nebula, formed the basis of the first of William's scientific papers on which Margaret Huggins appeared as co-author and serve as a benchmark in their relationship  (W. Huggins and M. L. Huggins, &#145;On the spectrum&#146;). Their course of investigation, with Margaret Huggins and her husband alternating as observer and apparatus tender, confirmed their belief that the nebular line, though near that of magnesium, was nevertheless distinct from it. At the outset of the research effort Margaret Huggins noted the need for &#145;<i>photographs</i> of the complete neb[ular] spectrum and &hellip; the [magnesium] lines &hellip; on the same plates&#146; in order &#145;not to have to depend on <i>eye</i> observations in anything so difficult and important&#146;  (M. L. Huggins, notebook 2, 24 Oct 1888, Margaret Clapp Library, Wellesley College). One week after their only satisfactory photograph had been obtained Margaret Huggins made the alarming discovery that their specially calibrated comparison apparatus was slightly misaligned, but their anxiety subsided as continued investigation lent welcome support to their preliminary findings.<br>
<br>Margaret Huggins was co-author and illustrator of most of her husband's later published scientific papers. Her many and varied interests are evident in her own publications, which included a monograph on the master violin maker Giovanni Paulo Maggini (1892), articles on the armillary sphere and the astrolabe in the eleventh edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and articles in <span class="italic">Astronomy and Astrophysics</span>, <span class="italic">Astrophysical Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">Popular Astronomy</span>, among others. She assisted her husband in the editing and illustration of both <span class="italic">An Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra from &#955;4870 to &#955;3300</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">The Scientific Papers of Sir William Huggins</span> (1909).<br>
<br>Margaret Huggins was active in the British Astronomical Association from its inception in 1890. In 1903 she was elected to honorary fellowship in the Royal Astronomical Society. In that same year, immediately following the visit of Pierre and Marie Curie to London, the Hugginses instigated an entirely new line of research, namely photographing the spectrum of radium.<br>
<br>Following the death of her husband on 12 May 1910, Lady Huggins began work on a personal memoir of their life and work together. Although she was unable to see this project to completion, she was untiring in her efforts to ensure the accuracy of such accounts written by others in his memory. In 1913 she moved to 8 More's Garden, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where she died on 24 March 1915 after a long illness. Her ashes were laid beside those of her husband in Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex. The couple had no children. Lady Huggins bequeathed a number of scientific instruments and personal effects to Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts. This bequest included the six bound observatory notebooks she and her husband kept throughout their long observing careers.<br>
