<span class="headword">Monypenny,  William</span>, first Lord Monypenny  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1488), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the son of Sir William Monypenny and Margaret or Marjorie Arbuthnott, only daughter of Philip Arbuthnott of that ilk. Born shortly after 1410 he probably went to France in 1436 as part of the entourage of Margaret Stewart, daughter of James I, who married the dauphin Louis in that year, and by 1439 he was in the French king's service. In July 1447 Monypenny was described as <i>escuier d'escuieres</i> of Charles VII of France; he took a prominent part in the expulsion of the English from Normandy and was knighted on 16 October 1449 for his role in the siege of Rouen; rewarded by Charles VII in 1450 following the recovery of Normandy, he received the lordship of Concressault in Berry between 1451 and 1458.<br>
<br>Monypenny's French rewards were, if anything, exceeded by those from the Scottish crown. On 1 May 1450 he was given the lands of the Halls of Airth in Stirlingshire, specifically for ambassadorial services to James II's sisters and father; further grants of land in Stirlingshire, Aberdeenshire, and Kirkcudbrightshire were made in the 1450s. He was probably created a lord of parliament towards the end of James II's reign, about 1458; he is first described as Lord Monypenny in a grant of 17 July 1464.<br>
<br>Monypenny's career as a diplomat spanned more than three decades. After his entry into French service he acted as an ambassador for the Scottish crown in the negotiations leading to the marriage of James II's sister Isabella to Fran&ccedil;ois, count of Montfort (later duke of Brittany), in 1441&#150;2. In 1447 he sank a great deal of money into the abortive and tasteless French scheme to marry the recently widowed dauphin to Eleanor Stewart, younger sister of his widow, Margaret who had died as recently as 1445. Monypenny was Charles VII's ambassador in Scotland in 1456 and at Bourges in the summer of 1460 he presented James II's demands for a marriage alliance and for the Orkneys and Shetlands in full sovereignty to the astonished Danes. Such cosmopolitan activities involved a high degree of risk; in November 1451 he was captured by the English at Whitby, and ransomed only for an enormous sum put up jointly by Bishop William Turnbull of Glasgow and Charles VII of France.<br>
<br>Monypenny's later ambassadorial tasks, in association with his son Alexander (the child of his marriage to Catherine Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1486)), were almost wholly in the service of Louis XI, who gave him an annual pension of 1200 livres tournois and in October 1473 made him seneschal of Saintonge, the French county to which successive kings of Scots had laid claim&#151;in vain&#151;since 1428. Alexander had succeeded his father as second Lord Monypenny by 4 July 1488.<br>
