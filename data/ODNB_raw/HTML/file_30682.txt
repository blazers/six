<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  Charles Alfred</span>  (1870&#150;1945), <span class="occ">administrator in India and Tibetologist</span>, was born in Fort William, Calcutta, on 31 October 1870, the third son of Henry Bell, of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Anne, daughter of George Dumbell, of Douglas, Isle of Man. From Winchester Bell passed the Indian Civil Service examinations of 1889 and, after two years at New College, Oxford, went to Bengal in 1891. For nine years he worked in the plains, but in 1900, after a run of bad health, he was transferred to the gentler climate of Darjeeling.<br>
<br>Darjeeling introduced Bell to the culture of Tibet, which fascinated him. In 1904 he was given charge of the Chumbi valley, temporarily ceded by Tibet as a result of Francis Younghusband's controversial mission to Lhasa, and in 1905 he published <span class="italic">A Manual of Colloquial Tibetan</span>. In 1908 he was appointed political officer in Sikkim, which made him additionally the diplomatic agent for Bhutan and Tibet. He remained in this post until 1919, marrying, on 15 January 1912, Cashie Kerr (1876/7&#150;1935), daughter of David Fernie, shipowner, of Liverpool and Blundellsands, Lancashire.<br>
<br>In Sikkim Bell restored internal autonomy to the local ruler and, wary of the potential for ethnic conflict, attempted to limit the influence of Marwari traders from the plains. Similarly, in Bhutan he negotiated a treaty (1910) whereby the king retained autonomy in internal matters but handed over foreign affairs to the British, in effect establishing Bhutan as a British protectorate. In Tibet, however, Bell was forced to watch Britain reverse Younghusband's forward policy and allow the Chinese to occupy the country, although he in part compensated for Britain's apathy by befriending the thirteenth Dalai Lama, who sought sanctuary in Darjeeling in 1910. Bell was himself a religious man, slightly built, with delicate features and an unassuming demeanour, and the Dalai Lama warmed to him, thereafter treating him as a friend and trusted adviser.<br>
<br>After the revolution of 1911&#150;12 in China, during which the Tibetans repulsed the Chinese, Bell finally convinced his superiors that they should confront the power vacuum in Tibet. In 1913, the Chinese were brought, somewhat truculently, to a tripartite convention at Simla, which Bell attended as adviser to the British plenipotentiary, Sir Henry McMahon. McMahon won initial agreement to an accord which recognized Tibet's symbolic subordination to China while actually subjecting her to British influence, but the Chinese refused to ratify it, justly accusing Bell of telling the Tibetan plenipotentiary what to say in the negotiations. Bell's influence with the Tibetan plenipotentiary, the L&ouml;nchen Shatra, went further. He persuaded him that in return for Britain undertaking to shield Tibet from China, Tibet should allow goods from British India to enter duty-free and agree to shift the Indo-Tibetan border from the foothills to the crest of the Himalayas, giving India the fertile territory of Tawang (now Arunachal Pradesh) and establishing a new frontier known as the McMahon line. Bell was created CMG for his work with McMahon, but again he saw Britain squander its potential for influence. Several times during the First World War the Dalai Lama begged him to persuade the Indian government to allow Tibet to purchase modern weaponry and to levy duties on British Indian imports to pay for military expansion. Embarrassed by the tepidity of Britain's performance as an ally, Bell wholeheartedly endorsed these requests but was repeatedly rebuffed by the government.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bell retired, but he stayed on in Darjeeling to research Tibetan culture. He was thus on hand to be recalled in October 1920 to undertake a mission to Lhasa, a move triggered by the news that China had dispatched a new mission there. For Bell it was a wonderful personal opportunity, but the recent Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms forced him to modify his previously hawkish stance. He had never liked Indian interference in the region and, now that Britain had signalled its eventual departure from Asia, he began to push for meaningful Tibetan independence rather than the satellite status he had advanced earlier. He knew that independence depended on bureaucratic reform and a bigger army, but Lhasa's three great monasteries opposed any extension of military authority and exhibited a militancy throughout his mission which brought Tibet to the verge of civil war. When posters appeared in Lhasa calling for his death, Bell was moved to tone down his advice to the Dalai Lama, suggesting that he proceed cautiously with reform. As a result of his mission the arms embargo was lifted and Britain agreed to deal directly with Tibet without reference to the Chinese, measures which were sufficient to establish an Anglo-Tibetan cordiality that survived until 1947.<br>
<br>Bell retired permanently in 1921. He had been made CIE in 1919 and in 1922 was promoted to KCIE. He devoted the rest of his life to making Tibet intelligible to the wider world, and in 1924 published <span class="italic">Tibet Past and Present</span>, followed by <span class="italic">The People of Tibet</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">The Religion of Tibet</span> (1931). His final work, <span class="italic">Portrait of the Dalai Lama</span> (1946), was completed only a few days before his death. In researching it he revisited Tibet in 1934 and travelled on to Mongolia, Siberia, Manchuria, and China. He was accompanied throughout by his wife, but she died of cerebral meningitis in Peking (Beijing) in September 1935, after which he returned home. No longer constrained as an official, he had on this trip advised his Tibetan friends to seek an accommodation with China while their bargaining position was still strong. He saw little hope of lasting independence.<br>
<br>In 1939, with war in Europe imminent, Bell uprooted himself from his Berkshire home and went to British Columbia to finish his book. He died there, at his residence, the Old Charming Inn, Oak Bay, Victoria, on 8 March 1945. He was survived by a son, Major Arthur Fernie Bell (<i>b</i>. 1912), and two daughters.<br>
