<span class="headword">Dawes,  Elizabeth Anna Sophia</span>  (1864&#150;1954), <span class="occ">classical scholar and teacher</span>, was born on 7 November 1864 at Surbiton, Surrey, the daughter of the Revd John Samuel Dawes, of Newton House, Surbiton, and his wife, Anna Sophia Elizabeth Blasius. Her father, who held a DD degree from Trinity College, Dublin, and a PhD from the University of Jena, was a curate at Petersham, Surrey, from 1864 to 1868 but his main occupation was as a schoolmaster. Elizabeth Dawes was initially educated at home and then attended Bedford College, London, passing in the first division of both the matriculation (1881) and the intermediate examination (1882) of London University, coming first in German and obtaining honours for classics. In 1882 she followed her sister, Mary Clara Dawes (1861&#150;1939), to Girton College, Cambridge, where she was awarded Lady Stanley's scholarship of &pound;50 tenable for three years. In June 1885 she was placed high in the upper second class in the classical tripos, but as Cambridge degrees remained closed to women could not graduate there. In October 1885 she was placed in the first division of the final examination for the BA degree in the University of London, with honours in Greek and Latin.<br>
<br>In 1886 Dawes spent six months in Greece, studying archaeology and colloquial Greek, in which she became fluent. She spent the academic year 1886&#150;7 as professor of Greek and German at the Bryn Mawr Collegiate School, Baltimore, USA, before returning to take the London University MA examination in classics, in which she was placed fifth in June 1887. In June 1889 she completed her qualification as a candidate for the degree of DLitt (London), being placed first in the examination in medieval and modern French and German. She received her DLitt (the first to a woman) in 1895. Her doctoral thesis, published in 1889 as <span class="italic">The Pronunciation of Greek with Suggestions for a Reform in Teaching that Language</span>, represented her most important contribution to scholarship; it was followed by works on Attic Greek and Latin vocabularies (1890) and on the pronunciation of Greek aspirates (1894).<br>
<br>Dawes's vigorously argued study of Greek pronunciation supported the approach of revisionist scholars such as John Stuart Blackie and was inspired by her admiration of the nineteenth-century Greek political and cultural revival. It displays a wide scholarly range, analysing Greek literary, philosophical, and theological texts and inscriptions (including discussion of cutting techniques) and shows detailed knowledge of the European classical tradition and the debates from Erasmus (1528) onwards concerning the authenticity or otherwise of traditional pronunciation. She combined assessment of crucial issues such as the pronunciation of diphthongs and the disrupting effect of Latinized approaches with awareness of provincial peculiarities and a belief in the importance of evidence from pronunciation in Greece in her own time. Her method integrated linguistics with anthropological comparisons between ancient and modern Greece. She concluded that there was an unbroken tradition of pronunciation, traceable even from Homeric epic, and that the way to approach ancient literature was therefore to learn to speak the language (as with French and German), treating it as a living language. She attacked teaching methods in the public schools (which she regarded as contributing to the threatened place of classics in the curriculum and distancing people from an understanding of modern Greece) and recommended that Greek staff should be employed to converse and read with the pupils. The book (which was reviewed in the <span class="italic">Classical Review</span>, 4, 1890, 293&#150;6) was translated into modern Greek by her sister, Mary Dawes (1898).<br>
<br>Dawes was headmistress of the Ladies' School (later Heathlands), Weybridge, from 1889 to 1917 and later taught classics and German privately. After her retirement from teaching her attention turned to translations (in contrast to her earlier scepticism about their value). Her final work, translating the biographies of three Byzantine saints (1948), was produced in co-operation with Norman Hepburn Baynes, who contributed the introduction and notes, as she was by then unable to travel to libraries from her home in Weybridge. The aim was to produce a &#145;faithful version&#146;. Her life and work demonstrate how in the late nineteenth century women could achieve scholarly distinction outside the universities when the opportunities to develop an academic career within them remained very limited. She died, unmarried, in Weybridge Hospital, Surrey, on 19 August 1954.<br>
