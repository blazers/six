<span class="headword">Jones,  Elsie Elizabeth  Duncan-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elsie Elizabeth Phare]</span>  (1908&#150;2003), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at 3 Walnut Road, Chelston, Devon, on 2 July 1908, the elder daughter of Henry Phare, stationer and later radio engineer, and his wife, Hilda Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bull. Her brilliance was recognized at Torquay Girls' Secondary School, and in 1926 a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge, provided a much needed supplement to her county and state awards. Her college mentor was Enid Welsford, and she was a favoured pupil of Ivor Richards, for whose experiment in criticism she wrote one of the &#145;protocols&#146;. As president of Newnham's undergraduate literary society in June 1928 she secured a &#145;haughty&#146; Virginia Woolf, a friend of the principal, Pernel Strachey, for a talk that planted the seeds of <span class="italic">A Room of One's Own</span>  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 24 April 2003). William Empson enlisted her to contribute to <span class="italic">Experiment</span> and Terence White as a reviewer for <span class="italic">Granta</span>. Meanwhile, from a Methodist background, she had offered herself for confirmation as an Anglican in the high church milieu of Little St Mary's. At a time when women were not yet full members of the university, her starred first in part one of the English tripos, followed by a distinction in part two, set a record until then unmatched by either sex. This was crowned when she became the first woman to win both the chancellor's medal for English verse (1929) and later the Seatonian prize for religious poetry (1935, 1938). A research studentship from the college allowed her to pursue an interest in French literature in Paris, where she paid a struggling Jean Rhys to type her dissertation on the English civil-war exiles. Her memoirs of the time in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Review</span> (1982) and <span class="italic">Cambridge Women</span> (1996) were written with the easy elegance that characterized all her writing.<br>
<br>Having narrowly missed a Cambridge fellowship, in 1931 Elsie Phare became an assistant lecturer in English at the University College of Southampton, where she wrote a pastoral play, <span class="italic">Fidelia's Ghost</span>, and translated Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le misanthrope</span>. As E. E. Phare she made her critical d&eacute;but with the earliest book-length study of <span class="italic">The Poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins</span> (1933), which, while reflecting the influence of Richards in its focus on meaning and imagery, did not shrink from defining its subject through comparison with other poets. Her marriage on 17 April 1933 to Austin Ernest Duncan-Jones (1908&#150;1967), a Cambridge contemporary then teaching in the classics department, had by the regulations of the time already cost her the post. He was the son of Arthur Stuart Duncan-Jones, dean of Chichester; they had two sons, one of whom died young, and a daughter. At Birmingham University, where in 1936 her husband took up an appointment in philosophy (he was later professor of philosophy there, from 1951 until his death), she taught part-time until, on the outbreak of the Second World War, she obtained a lectureship. For the next forty years she helped, inspired, and charmed pupils and colleagues alike, retiring in 1976 with the rank of reader. Her scope was broad: Helen Gardner, a close friend from those days, attributed her own understanding of Eliot's &#145;Ash Wednesday&#146; to an essay that she wrote in 1947, and hailed her perspicacity as her greatest debt in annotating Donne.<br>
<br>From 1949 to 2001 a stream of discoveries and insights, published initially through the letter pages of the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> and in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, established Elsie Duncan-Jones as a leading authority on Andrew Marvell. For this she was admirably equipped by uncommonly attentive reading in all areas of seventeenth-century literature, both English and French, a formidable memory, and acute literary sensibilities. During a period of vastly increasing critical interest in Marvell's poems, her biographical and historical researches provided vital clues to context and date. Literary debts, traced from as far afield as classical authors or contemporary political prose, were identified and interpreted, and she had a determined eye for the literal element in the poems. Unmoved to theorize and disinclined by temperament to embark on large projects of her own, she nevertheless assisted the veteran French scholar Pierre Legouis in an English abridgement (1965) of his pioneering study <span class="italic">Andr&eacute; Marvell</span> (1929), and successfully collaborated in revising H. M. Margoliouth's Oxford text of the <span class="italic">Poems and Letters</span> (1971), matching him almost note for note in the commentary. In the year of her retirement, her lively Warton lecture on English poetry, &#145;Marvell: a great master of words&#146; (1975), drew on an equally unrivalled knowledge of the letters and polemical prose to define an underlying rhetoric of praise and blame. Back in Cambridge, where she lived in her retirement, she continued to promote understanding of Marvell's work by her own writings and, even more, through the advice that she gave to the many scholars who sought her out.<br>
<br>Elsie Duncan-Jones was of middle height. A portrait photograph taken around the time of her marriage captures her prettiness&#151;the term did not displease&#151;and vivacity. While unfailingly kind, she was capable of sharpness when warranted, and sudden mischievous questions. Her curiosity was inexhaustible: news of fresh discoveries, however trivial or recondite, delighted her, and she could always be relied on to enlarge their significance. Her nineties, when a severe illness left her housebound and fretful at her diminished capacity for work, were cheered by the companionship of her former pupil Anthea Morrison. She died at her home, 16 Amhurst Court, Grange Road, Cambridge, on 7 April 2003, of bronchopneumonia, her funeral taking place on 15 April at Little St Mary's, with which she had kept up a close connection. She was survived by her son Richard, an ancient historian, and her daughter, Katherine, a Shakespeare scholar.<br>
