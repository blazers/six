<span class="headword">Oppenheim,  Edward Phillips</span>  (1866&#150;1946), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London on 22 October 1866, the son of a leather merchant, Edward John Oppenheim, and his wife, Henrietta Susannah Temperley Budd. His father's business was located in Leicester, where Oppy (as he was always called) attended Wyggeston grammar school, gaining a history prize but no other distinctions. In 1882 he was removed from school by his father, on the claim that the family business was in difficulties. However, that action was probably designed to deter Oppenheim from becoming a full-time writer, as was his desire. In part it succeeded, for he worked in the leather business for almost twenty years, travelling to London, Norwich, and the continent and even, in 1892, to the United States, where he met and married Elsie Clara Hopkins of Easthampton, Massachusetts. Theirs was to be a lifelong partnership, little disturbed by Oppenheim's numerous and notorious affairs with other women. They had one daughter, Geraldine, and lived initially in a house 8 miles from Leicester, Oppenheim playing cricket for the village and serving as sidesman in the local parish church.<br>
<br>However, Oppenheim had no desire to settle into placid business life. He had visited Monaco and gained what was to be a lifelong fascination with the opulent life of wealthy British expatriates in the C&ocirc;te d'Azur. Moreover, his writing ambitions had not been deterred by the indifferent reception to his first novel, <span class="italic">Expiation</span> (1887), &#145;a novel of England and Canada&#146;. Instead, after a full day of work, he would spend long evenings in writing. His second novel, <span class="italic">A Monk of Cruta</span>, did not appear until 1894 but, after that, a growing flood of writings poured from his pen.<br>
<br>Following his father's death (probably in 1898), Oppenheim was able progressively to sever his connections with the leather trade. In 1905 the family moved to Sheringham in Norfolk, where he followed for a while the comfortable life of a country squire. Even so, he did not cease to write. Quite the contrary; his productivity increased. By the end of 1906 he had published thirty novels, notably <span class="italic">The World's Great Snare</span> (1896), <span class="italic">The Mysterious Mr. Sabin</span> (1898), <span class="italic">The Man and his Kingdom</span> (1899), and <span class="italic">A Millionaire of Yesterday</span> (1900). His work during this period established the genre of romantic intrigue in high places that was to please his public so much.<br>
<br>In several of his early novels, Oppenheim had dealt with the menace of German militarism. When the First World War broke out in 1914, this gained him an appointment with the Ministry of Information in London. A particular responsibility was to take neutral journalists on tours of the front in France&#151;a task he performed better than the writing of propaganda, even on one occasion unmasking a German spy who was posing as a journalist.<br>
<br>During the war and afterwards, the Oppenheims lived in rented houses in London, Devon, and Surrey; then there was a return to Norfolk, with the purchase of Reepham House. Yet Oppenheim was not contented; the lure of the French Riviera was too strong, and his income from his writings growing fast. It was boosted especially by two excellent novels of espionage&#151;<span class="italic">The Kingdom of the Blind</span> (1917) and <span class="italic">The Great Impersonation</span> (1920). In 1921 Oppenheim abruptly sold Reepham House and transported his family and possessions to France. After renting several furnished villas, he purchased the Villa Deveron, a house standing by a golf course&#151;golf was a passion&#151;at Cagnes-sur-Mer, about half-way between Cannes and Nice. In that house they remained for almost thirteen years. Those years brought unbroken literary success, Oppenheim's novels and short stories mostly being sold for large sums to American magazines in advance of book publication. His life was one of writing (or rather, dictating to his secretary, for Oppenheim wrote no synopses, building the plot as his ideas flowed), entertaining, gambling (though never for large sums), and romantic affairs, the latter most often conducted discreetly on his yacht, <i>Echo I</i>.<br>
<br>In 1934 the Villa Deveron was sold. The Oppenheims moved to Guernsey, buying a house called Le Vauqui&eacute;dor at St Peter Port. However, this was merely a device to evade French death duties; they continued to spend much time on the Riviera. Oppenheim's writing pace was unabated; his eventual publishing record consisted of 118 novels (five initially under the pseudonym Anthony Partridge), forty-four collections of short stories, four plays, a travel book, and a remarkably uninformative autobiography, <span class="italic">The Pool of Memory</span> (1941). He was also a skilled illustrator of his own work.<br>
<br>Although he had perceived the German threat that caused the First World War, Oppenheim could not believe that there would be another. In 1938 he purchased the Domaine des Rouguets, near Grasse, and after an unwise return from Guernsey in the summer of 1939, he and Elsie found themselves trapped there by the collapse of France, only managing to escape via Spain and Portugal to England in early 1941. Before such an action was officially permitted, they hired a yacht and were landed back on Guernsey in September 1945&#151;a brave venture, when Oppenheim was seventy-nine and both he and his wife were in poor health. After further conflicts with the authorities, they succeeded in repossessing Le Vauqui&eacute;dor, and Oppenheim died there on 3 February 1946, his wife soon following him.<br>
<br>Between the two world wars, Oppenheim's novels were rivalled in popularity only by those of Edgar Wallace. They are, as Robert Standish notes, the product of an &#145;unending battle between the hedonist and the Puritan, the playboy libertine and the hard-headed man of affairs&#146;  (Standish). Though romance is rife, bedroom scenes do not figure and children scarcely gain mention. The women are always desirable, the men&#151;though sometimes initially dissolute&#151;always prove, under test, to be of sterling worth. Such novels furnished an escape for readers from their own drab lives into a dream world of adventure, wealth, and luxury. In his time, Oppenheim was called &#145;the Prince of Storytellers&#146;. Although some of his writings have dated beyond recall and all are now out of fashion, they remain highly readable.<br>
