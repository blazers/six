<span class="headword">Markham, Sir  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1399, <em>d.</em> 1479), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18067/', "John Markham (d. 1409)")</script> a justice of the common pleas. His mother was Elizabeth, sister and coheir of Hugh Cressy of Hodsock, Nottinghamshire. He followed his father's profession, and in 1438 was called from Gray's Inn to the coif. Retained by the duchy of Lancaster from 1438 to 1444, he was appointed king's serjeant on 1 July 1443, promoted to king's bench on 6 February 1444, and appointed chief justice of that court on 13 May 1461, after the accession of Edward IV had sent Sir John Fortescue into political exile. At Edward's coronation Markham was created a knight of the Bath (along with his nephew), and his standing was even sufficient to secure William Yelverton a knighthood to compensate for missing promotion. He continued to be closely involved with Edward, particularly in putting down rebellion in Gloucestershire in 1464. From 1459 to 1468 he sat regularly as a royal adviser in the Lords.<br>
<br>John Markham was paid as chief justice of king's bench to Michaelmas 1468, and the warrant appointing Thomas Billing as his successor on 23 January 1469 states that Markham had been discharged &#145;by his desire and special requeste&#146;, on the grounds of &#145;his grete age and debilite&#146;  (Sutton). However, legal and City of London sources agree that Edward IV sacked Markham. The fullest version of what would be the only dismissal of a chief justice in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (other than at a change of monarch) is given in the early sixteenth-century great chronicle of London. Markham had presided in the summer of 1468 in a treason trial which could only obtain the conviction of Sir Thomas Cook, a wealthy draper and former lord mayor of London, on the lesser charge of misprision (concealment). With typical anti-Woodville bias the chronicle says that Edward took revenge on the chief justice because his wife's relations had wanted to pay off a family grudge as well as enjoy the spoils of Cook's ruin. Among lawyers memories were different. Fortescue (who was abroad at the time) implies that the issue was the admissibility of information obtained by torture; Thomas More's <span class="italic">History of King Richard III</span> states that Markham &#145;left his office&#146; rather than concur with the condemnation of Thomas Burdet, although that took place in 1477; Chief Justice Thomas Bromley in 1553 identified the case as that of Walter Walker (1460). But confused though they are, the memories do suggest that more than &#145;age and weakness&#146; was involved. Markham had ten years to live!<br>
<br>A possible explanation can be conjectured if two other sources are brought in&#151;trial records which hint that Cook probably was guilty, but that the evidence was not there, and the report of Chief Justice William Hussey that Markham (whom he knew) had told Edward IV that a king could not in person arrest anyone on suspicion of treason. Together these suggest that Markham had found himself having to inform the king not only that the court could not on the evidence secure a verdict of treason from a London jury, but that neither could Edward act by prerogative. The story Fortescue heard would fit with this, on the supposition that there had been argument over the prosecution evidence, which is known to have been obtained from the torture of alleged accomplices. Markham continued in office after the trial and kept up pressure on Cook until the autumn. Nevertheless he had failed in the essential duty of the chief justice, namely to give the crown the judicial outcome it wanted within the limits of due process. Deprived of the king's confidence he felt he had to go, with a face-saving excuse and a decent interval before a successor was appointed.<br>
<br>The stories of Markham's dismissal made his name a byword for judicial integrity. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton reminded the chief justice presiding at his own treason trial in 1554 of &#145;the example of your honourable predecessors Justice Markham and others, which did eschew corrupt judgements, judging directly and sincerely after the law and the principles in the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 1.894). How deserved this reputation was in other matters it is hard to say. Markham had been a puisne in 1452 when king's bench began to develop legal fictions in order to secure business, and as chief justice did not challenge them, but nothing suggests that he took the initiative in this. Contemporary correspondence shows Markham involved in legal manoeuvres, in one case agitating for a fee, and in another applying pressure in support of colleagues, but equally he appears as capable of a blunt morality and always active in promoting compromise, not litigation. A contemporary private note describes him as <i>eximi et praeclari</i> and &#145;ryghte noble and famous&#146;  (Markham, 125&#150;6).<br>
<br>Markham married Margaret, daughter of Simon Leek of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, granddaughter and heir of Sir John Talbot of Donnington. He lived at Sedgebrook in Lincolnshire and built up a substantial estate in the county and in Rutland. Markham died on 20 March 1479 and was survived by three of his five sons. His heir, Thomas, became insane and his principal executor was his nephew, Sir Robert Markham MP, &#145;a man of great prowess&#146; who fought for Henry VII at Stoke.<br>
