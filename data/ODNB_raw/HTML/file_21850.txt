<span class="headword">Penn,  John</span>  (1760&#150;1834), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London on 22 February 1760, and baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 21 March, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21855/', "Thomas Penn (1702&#150;1775)")</script>, landowner, and his wife, Lady Juliana (1729&#150;1801), daughter of Thomas Fermor, first earl of Pomfret. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21857/', "William Penn (1644&#150;1718)")</script>, founder of Pennsylvania, was his grandfather. On the death of his father in 1775 John succeeded to his property, which included the moiety of the last proprietorship of the province of Pennsylvania, with hereditary governorship, and Stoke Poges Park in Buckinghamshire, near Windsor, which his father had purchased in 1760. On the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775, John apparently accompanied his mother to Geneva. He went to Eton College and then entered Clare College, Cambridge, in 1776 as a nobleman (by virtue of his maternal descent). He matriculated in 1777 and was created MA in 1779 and LLD on 28 June 1811.<br>
<br>From 1782 to 1789 Penn lived in America, attending to his Pennsylvania property, and built the house called Solitude at Schuylkill. He and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21849/', "John Penn (1729&#150;1795)")</script> received from the assembly in 1786 the grant of &pound;15,000 annually as payment for the estate vested in the commonwealth as by law passed on 18 January 1786. In 1789 he returned to England, and in the following year received his portion of the &pound;4000 annuity granted by parliament in consideration of the losses in Pennsylvania. The house at Stoke Poges having fallen into decay, he commenced, in 1789, the erection of a new one in the centre of the park, from designs by Nasmith, which were completed by James Wyatt. He later published an anonymous <span class="italic">Historical and Descriptive Account of Stoke Park</span> (1813).<br>
<br>Penn drew on his American experiences to produce his drama <span class="italic">The Battle of Eddington, or, British Liberty</span> (1792), which was performed several times in the early nineteenth century. His <span class="italic">Letters on the Drama</span> (1796) appeared anonymously in London, and his <span class="italic">A Timely Appeal to the Common Sense of the People of Great Britain</span> was published there in 1798, followed by <span class="italic">Further Thoughts on the Present State of Public Opinion</span> (1800). Penn's primary literary interest was poetry, however, and in addition to a volume of <span class="italic">Poems</span> printed on his private press at Stoke Park in 1796, he also produced <span class="italic">Critical, Poetical and Dramatic Works</span> (1797), <span class="italic">Poems, Consisting of Original Works, Imitations, and Translations</span> (1801, 1802), and <span class="italic">Observations in Illustration of Virgil's Fourth Eclogue</span> (1810).<br>
<br>In 1798 Penn was sheriff of Buckinghamshire. He represented the borough of Helston, Cornwall, in the parliament of 1802 and continued to do so until 1805 when he was appointed governor of Portland Castle, Dorset, an office he held until his death. In 1800, he erected on Portland Island, from designs by Wyatt, a mansion which he styled Pennsylvania Castle. He was lieutenant-colonel of the 1st (Eton) troop of the 1st (South) regiment of the Royal Buckinghamshire yeomanry and commandant of the Royal Portland Legion.<br>
<br>The publication of an anonymous poem called &#145;Marriage&#146;, in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> in the summer of 1815 led Penn to organize in 1817 a &#145;matrimonial society&#146;, which had for its object an improvement in the domestic life of married persons. Extending its aims to other schemes of domestic utility, the society changed its name in May to that of the Outinian Society. During the summer of 1818 meetings of the society took place at Penn's house, 10 New Street, Spring Gardens, London, and later at Stoke Park. Penn, who acted as president, edited the works of the society for publication from 1819 to 1823.<br>
<br>Penn died unmarried at Stoke Poges Park on 21 June 1834, and was succeeded in his estates there and at Portland by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21847/', "Granville Penn")</script>.<br>
