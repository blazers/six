<span class="headword">Kirkpatrick,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1687, <em>d.</em> 1728), <span class="occ">antiquary and draughtsman</span>, was baptized on 7 March 1687 at Haveringland, Norfolk, the eldest of seven children of Thomas Kirkpatrick (<i>d</i>. 1710?), probably a grazier, and his wife, Anne Sendall (<i>d</i>. 1742). His father was from Closeburn, Dumfriesshire, and apparently was related to the baronetcy of Kirkpatrick. Nothing is known of his mother's family. His parents married at Haveringland on 6 May 1686, and the family moved to the parish of St Stephen, Norwich, about 1691. There is no record of his education, but he was apprenticed to Thomas Andrew, merchant, of St Clement's parish, and became a freeman as linen draper on 24 February 1711. He is so described in the 1714 Norwich poll in St George Tombland. He later entered the service of John Custance, alderman, whom he subsequently joined in partnership, and with whose family he shared a house in St Andrew's parish until his death. Kirkpatrick served as a common councillor and auditor from 1719 to 1727, and in 1726 was appointed treasurer of the great hospital in St Helen's parish. He married Ann Harvey, the youngest daughter of John Harvey, a Norwich merchant, who seems to have predeceased him; there were no children.<br>
<br>Throughout his adult life Kirkpatrick was a member of &#145;a little Society of Icenian Antiquaries&#146;  (Nichols, 3.433) that included Thomas Tanner, Benjamin Mackerell, and Peter Le Neve, with whom he exchanged notes. It was through Le Neve's influence that he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 18 February 1719. He compiled extensive and valuable notes relating to the history of Norwich and built up noteworthy collections of manuscript and printed books and ancient coins, all of which he left to the city. He was also a fine artist and his views of the ancient city gates of Norwich (1720) were copied and etched by Henry Ninham in 1864. His notes were also used in Robert Fitch's introduction to John Ninham's views of Norwich gates in 1861. Other drawings are listed by Johnson and in Gough's <span class="italic">British Topography</span>. His draughtsmanship is sometimes confused with that of his younger brother Thomas Kirkpatrick (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1755), chamberlain of Norwich 1732&#150;44. It was Thomas who drew the large north-east prospect of Norwich, which was published by John in 1723.<br>
<br>Kirkpatrick published nothing else during his lifetime. He died on 20 August 1728 and was buried in St Helen's Church, Norwich, on 27 August 1728. In 1741 Thomas Kirkpatrick attempted to forestall the publication of Francis Blomefield's <span class="italic">History of Norwich</span> by announcing the imminent publication of a specimen of his brother's work. Blomefield had advertised his own access to Kirkpatrick's materials, although he possessed only the original rough notes exchanged with Le Neve, but this specimen was not published. Kirkpatrick's <span class="italic">Notes Concerning Norwich Castle</span> were, however, published in 1836 and 1847, and his <span class="italic">History of the Religious Orders and Communities &hellip; of Norwich</span> in 1845, with a preface by Dawson Turner. <span class="italic">The Streets and Lanes of the City of Norwich</span> was edited from Kirkpatrick's notes by William Hudson in 1889, but other valuable manuscript works listed in the 1845 preface appear to have been lost.<br>
<br>Kirkpatrick's substantial bequest of early printed and manuscript books may be identified from Mackerell's catalogue of the Norwich City Library in 1732, but a proposed catalogue of his coin collection was never published. The bulk of the coin collection was subsequently lost through neglect and pilfering. Kirkpatrick's historical manuscripts were left to his brother Thomas during his lifetime and to the city thereafter, but were also subsequently dispersed.<br>
