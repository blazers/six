<span class="headword">Annesley,  Arthur</span>, fifth earl of Anglesey  (<em>c.</em>1678&#150;1737), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third son of James Annesley, second earl of Anglesey (<i>c</i>.1645&#150;1690), landowner, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Manners (<i>d</i>. 1700), daughter of the eighth earl of Rutland. His family's traditions and connections were presbyterian and whiggish, exemplified in his own appointment as a gentleman of the privy chamber to William III in 1689, while still a boy. But after education at Eton College (<i>c</i>.1693&#150;7) and Magdalene College, Cambridge (1698&#150;9), he emerged into adulthood as a high-church tory. At Cambridge he had enjoyed a brilliant reputation, publishing an edition of Latin poetry while still an undergraduate, and being elected to a college fellowship in 1700, the year after taking his MA degree. On 6 January 1702 he married his cousin Mary (<i>d</i>. 1719), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27269/', "John Thompson, first Baron Haversham")</script>, politician, and Frances Annesley. They had no children.<br>
<br>Annesley was returned for the university constituency to the first parliament of Queen Anne's reign; he soon enjoyed a reputation as a fluent and forthright speaker, and was drawn into the orbit of Secretary Nottingham, probably the leading lay high-churchman of his day. In 1703 he went over to secure election to the Irish parliament for the borough of New Ross, not far from his family's estate in co. Wexford. He attended the first session of Queen Anne's Irish parliament, in the winter of 1703&#150;4, and quickly made his presence felt, arguing for the removal of the <i>regium donum</i>, the annual pension granted by the crown to Presbyterian ministers, and supporting the imposition of the sacramental test. Following the ministerial reconstruction in England in the spring of 1704, in which Nottingham and other high tories lost office, Annesley became one of the loudest of the ministry's critics at Westminster, and was closely associated with the legislative campaign against occasional conformity. He thus attracted the unwelcome attentions of pro-ministerial writers, who denounced his bullying rhetoric, &#145;expressed in the style of Billingsgate&#146;  (Lord and others, 7.115&#150;16), and even accused him of disloyalty to the protestant succession, on the basis of a misconstruction of remarks he had made in Dublin. The court party also made strenuous efforts to turn him out of his Westminster seat at the general election of 1705. Personal spite, as well as political enmity, lay behind this attack, since in the previous session Annesley had turned his oratory against the lord treasurer himself. But the university electorate reacted in his favour. One college head vehemently denied that Annesley was a &#145;turbulent&#146; man, declaring that &#145;he is a scholar, and has been long of my acquaintance as such, and has acquitted himself in all University business entrusted to him with great approbation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.179). The result was a popular triumph, and Annesley was returned at the head of the poll.<br>
<br>In the 1705 parliament Annesley was again one of the most prominent speakers on the tory side, often acting in concert with Sir Thomas Hanmer. In January 1707 he denounced in particularly forthright terms the proposed settlement on the duke of Marlborough but, conscious of the danger of being imputed a Jacobite, he moved promptly at the time of the invasion scare in the spring of 1708 to propose a loyal address to the queen. Re-elected at Cambridge in 1708, he used his friendship with Nottingham to promote a reconciliation between the high tories and those &#145;moderates&#146;, headed by former secretary of state Robert Harley, who had been excluded from the ministry in March of that year. In the Commons he was as fierce as ever in defence of tory interests, speaking against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. He also made &#145;a very warm speech&#146; in January 1710 against a motion for an address to send over the duke of Marlborough to attend the peace negotiations, which he said would be &#145;exalting that man whose pride was already intolerable, setting him above the crown, which would make us the most abject of slaves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 110). Such performances only increased his popularity at Cambridge, where he would doubtless have been re-elected in 1710 had it not been for the sudden death of his brother, upon which he succeeded to the earldom of Anglesey (and the title of Viscount Valentia in the Irish peerage). He also acquired the lucrative post of joint vice-treasurer and paymaster-general in Ireland, which may have satisfied what contemporaries saw as his avaricious streak, but left greater ambitions unfulfilled.<br>
<br>Undaunted by the atmosphere of the upper house, Anglesey continued to speak his mind. Although anxious to see thoroughly tory policies pursued, and dissenters and whigs harried, he did not at first prove to be a source of embarrassment to the court. Indeed, he seems to have been prepared to give the new chief minister, Harley, the benefit of the doubt, thus marking his emancipation from the influence of Nottingham, who had been excluded from the new ministry and smouldered in resentment. However impatient Anglesey might have been in private, he said nothing in public against Harley (now earl of Oxford), and after spending the autumn of 1711 attending the Irish House of Lords, he returned to Westminster more ostentatiously loyal than ever, possibly as a consequence of observing the duke of Ormond's failures as viceroy in Ireland, which opened the way for Anglesey himself to succeed. This ambition may well have determined his political conduct. During the winter of 1711&#150;12 he consistently supported administration, distancing himself from Nottingham's rebellion over the peace. But he did not receive any further advancement, and Harley's eventual replacement of Ormond by the moderate whig Lord Shrewsbury provoked Anglesey into a rebellion of his own. He joined Hanmer and other &#145;whimsicals&#146; in June 1713 in opposing parliamentary confirmation of the commercial treaty with France, then attended Shrewsbury's ill-fated Irish parliament in order to undermine the viceroy, exploiting his membership of the Irish privy council to prevent agreement between the council and Dublin corporation over the disputed election of a lord mayor, which precluded any wider political settlement and destroyed the viceroy's &#145;moderating scheme&#146;.<br>
<br>Back in England, Anglesey followed an erratic course, driven by his restless ambition to secure the Irish viceroyalty. As Oxford and Bolingbroke struggled for control of the ministry, Anglesey tacked from one to the other. Often he found himself opposing government, and contemporaries identified him as a pro-Hanoverian. But although his commitment to the protestant succession was never in doubt, and was reinforced by his private correspondence with Hanover, it may not have been his first concern. Typically, his most vigorous speech in the 1714 parliament was in favour of the extension to Ireland of the <span class="roman">Schism Bill</span>, and he was reported as having declared in a coffee house that there was no difference between Presbyterians and papists, who &#145;jumbled together &hellip; would make an excellent salad for the devil&#146;  (Alan Brodrick to Thomas Brodrick, 24 June 1714, Midleton MS 1248/3, fol. 187, Surrey RO, Woking). In July he was given a commission to remodel the Irish army, and travelled to Dublin, only to be greeted on his arrival by the news of the queen's death. He returned to London to take up a place on the regency commission, and made every effort to keep the confidence of the king, to the extent of learning French in order to converse at court. Unlike other Hanoverian tories, he made no bones about serving with the whigs, as he held on to his Irish vice-treasurership. But he was not left in peace. The story of the attempted purge of the Irish army was published, and his enemies kept up a constant harassment, which by March 1715 resulted in the loss of his position at court. The Irish parliament of 1715&#150;16 increased the pressure with resolutions condemning his conduct as an Irish privy councillor in 1713. Soon afterwards he was removed from office, proclaiming that he had departed voluntarily but privately expressing his outrage. Anglesey remained a strong voice at the head of the tory minority on the opposition benches at Westminster, and occasionally, though infrequently, reappeared in Dublin, where the tory interest had sunk even lower. But he took little part in &#145;patriotic&#146; defence of Irish constitutional rights, and gradually distanced himself from Ireland. For a time he re-established a working alliance with Nottingham, in defence of the interests of the Church of England. There was talk that Anglesey might return to office in a ministerial reconstruction in 1722, and he was approached again in 1725. The Jacobites thought that he &#145;stands fairest to be at the head of the Tories&#146;  ([James Hamilton] to [the Old Pretender], 26 Nov 1723, Stuart MS 70/107), but made no effort to recruit him. On the death of George I he made an Olympian, though ineffectual, intervention in Irish politics, by encouraging the remnant of the Irish tory party to come to court. His own appointment as governor of co. Wexford was almost the party's only gain. By now he was a permanent absentee, spending most of his time on his English estates, in Oxfordshire and Hampshire. He was still capable of making an impression in parliament, as in 1736, when he denounced the partisan exclusion of the tory Lord Arran, high steward of Westminster, from the commission to rebuild Westminster Bridge. But years of hard drinking were taking their toll. He suffered increasingly from gout and eventually died from its effects on 31 March 1737, at his hunting lodge, Farnborough Place. He was buried in Farnborough parish church. He bequeathed his considerable personalty to his cousin Francis Annesley, but the entailed estates, worth between &pound;7000 and &pound;10,000 p.a. (and, according to some observers, potentially far more), and his peerages descended to two other cousins, Charles Annesley of Cork, who took the property, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/565/', "Richard Annesley, Lord Altham")</script>, who succeeded to the titles. Annesley had despised both, &#145;a brute&#146; and &#145;a rogue&#146; respectively  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 2.387&#150;8), but he had done nothing to impair Charles Annesley's inheritance: &#145;though he might have raised very large sums by renewing leases, he scrupled doing it, and said estates ought fully to go where the law intends them&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
