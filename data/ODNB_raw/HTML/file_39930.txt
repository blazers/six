<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Edwards,  James Keith O'Neill <span class="st"> [Jimmy]</span></span>  (1920&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 23 March 1920 in Barnes, Surrey, the fifth of five sons and eighth of nine children of Reginald Walter Kenrick Edwards, professor of mathematics at King's College, London, and his wife, Phyllis Katherine Cowan, who was from New Zealand. He was educated at St Paul's Cathedral choir school and at King's College School, Wimbledon, where he first developed what was to become a lifelong enthusiasm for brass instruments and learned to play the trombone. In 1938 he went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he read history and developed a mock &#145;professor&#146; act for the Cambridge Footlights, in which he gave a musical lecture on the trombone.<br>
<br>Edwards's university career was interrupted by the Second World War, and in 1939 he joined the Royal Air Force, eventually succeeding in his ambition to become a pilot. In 1944 he was flying a hazardous mission towing gliders and dropping supplies to the beleaguered troops at Arnhem when his Dakota was badly hit by a German Focke-Wulf. He made a successful landing, saving the lives of two men on board and sustaining burns to his face which he later disguised by growing the magnificent handlebar moustache that was to become his trademark. He was awarded the DFC in 1945 for his skill and bravery.<br>
<br>Throughout his RAF career Edwards had successfully entertained the troops with his &#145;professor&#146; act, and so after demobilization in 1946 he contemplated life as an entertainer. He served his apprenticeship at London's Windmill Theatre, where he met Frank Muir, who with Denis Norden was to write his most successful comedy material. In 1948 Muir and Norden created one of Edwards's best loved characters, the bibulous belligerent Pa Glum in the BBC radio comedy programme <span class="italic">Take it from here</span>, which ran from 1948 until 1959. The programme commanded audiences of more than 20 million and made Edwards a wealthy man. He bought polo ponies, an aeroplane, and a farm in Fittleworth, Sussex, which was run by his elder brother Alan while Edwards played the local squire. Fox-hunting was one of his favourite pastimes, and he was proud to be made master of foxhounds of the Old Surrey and Burstow hunt. In 1951 he was elected lord rector of Aberdeen University, an appointment he held until 1954.<br>
<br>From 1957 until 1977 Edwards appeared in <span class="italic">Does the Team Think?</span>, a radio panel game he had devised in which four comedians answered light-hearted questions from a studio audience. He attempted some &#145;straight&#146; acting, turning in a creditable Sir Toby Belch in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> and Falstaff in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> for BBC radio (both 1962). On television he found a tailor-made role in the series <span class="italic">Whack-o!</span> (1957&#150;61 and 1971&#150;2), in which he played the corpulent, conniving headmaster of Chiselbury School. His films included <span class="italic">Three Men in a Boat</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Bottoms up</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The Plank</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">It's your Move</span> (1982). Perhaps most surprising of all, in 1964 he stood as Conservative candidate for Paddington North, and although he did not win his seat, he polled 10,639 votes&#151;more than his predecessor had gained.<br>
<br>Edwards's private life was less satisfactory. In 1958 he married Valerie, a British Overseas Airways Corporation ground steward, daughter of William Seymour, small landowner. They had no children and eventually divorced in 1969. She later told the press that on their honeymoon he had admitted that he was a homosexual &#145;trying to reform&#146;. In 1976 Ramon Douglas, an Australian female impersonator, told the tabloid newspapers that for the past ten years he and Edwards had shared a &#145;loving relationship&#146;. Even though he was personally devastated by the resulting publicity, Edwards found that his career did not suffer, and in 1978 he was invited to reinvent his Pa Glum character when the Glums were revived for television. In 1984 he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Six of the Best</span>, which followed an earlier autobiography, <span class="italic">Take it from me</span> (1953).<br>
<br>By the early 1980s Edwards's blustering style of comedy was going out of fashion and he concentrated on touring in plays such as <span class="italic">Big Bad Mouse</span> with his friend Eric Sykes. He spent more time in the house he had bought in Perth, Western Australia, and it was there in 1988 that he became ill with bronchial pneumonia. He returned to England and died in the Cromwell Hospital, London, on 7 July 1988.<br>
