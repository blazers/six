<span class="headword">Preston,  Thomas</span>  (1774&#150;1850), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born in London, the son of unknown parents. His father died when he was in his infancy, and when his mother remarried the baby was given to a nurse to look after; at the age of six months an accident left him with a limp for the rest of his life. After a limited education he was apprenticed in turn to a silversmith and a shoemaker, and then spent years tramping around England and Ireland, in Cork leading a successful shoemakers' strike. On returning to London, probably in 1794, he joined the London Corresponding Society, but during Pitt's repression in the mid-1790s he went to Chatham to avoid imprisonment. After a trip to the West Indies he settled again in London and married a widow with three children, details of whom are unknown; they had four children, at least three girls reaching adulthood. The couple ran three shoemaker's shops, employing forty people, and prospered. But in 1807 Preston's wife left him for another man, his business soon failed, and he fell into poverty. A supporter of Sir Francis Burdett in 1810, he was active in several literary and debating clubs, and in 1811 became a supporter of Thomas Spence and his advocacy of common ownership of land. After Spence's death in 1814 his followers formed a regular society of Spencean Philanthropists, with Preston a leading member and known as the Bishop because of his use of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in support of Spenceanism. In 1816 the Spenceans tried to capitalize on the widespread poverty and unemployment in London. Preston joined a society of artisans campaigning for limitations on the use of machinery, not from any agreement with their aims but in the hope of raising an agitation, and as their secretary it was he who called the famous meeting at Spa Fields to petition parliament and the prince regent for relief. The Spenceans James Watson and Arthur Thistlewood played the leading role in organizing this meeting, and Preston organized support among the unemployed silk-weavers of Spitalfields. At the second Spa Fields meeting on 2 December 1816, Thistlewood, Preston, and Watson's son, also James, tried to start an armed rising and led a section of the crowd into the City, where they were soon dispersed. Preston was among those arrested and one of the four charged with high treason, but the acquittal of Watson after the unmasking of an agent provocateur, John Castles, led to the dropping of the charges against the rest.<br>
<br>For the next three years Watson, Thistlewood, and Preston were the leaders of the London group of ultra-radicals and revolutionaries, with Preston the most committed Spencean, although while Watson favoured open mass action the other two preferred secret conspiracies. Late in 1819 they were the leaders of what became known as the Cato Street conspiracy to assassinate members of the government, the inner circle meeting at Preston's house, but he avoided prosecution when the attempt failed in February 1820 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58584/', "Cato Street conspirators (act. 1820)")</script>].<br>
<br>Preston was not very active in the 1820s, but remained a member of a radical group in the East End of London, and in the early 1830s became a leading figure in the ultra-radical National Union of the Working Classes. At some point he also remarried and had a son. In 1834, in distressed circumstances and embittered, he published a plan, drawing on proposals by Spence and Thomas Paine, for state pensions for the aged, widows, the sick, and orphans, funded by a special tax and death duties (including appropriation of land as the means to ultimate national ownership of all land). In the later 1830s he was an associate of veteran Spenceans and new radical figures such as Julian Harney, and in the 1840s was an occasional lecturer at Chartist meetings. He also published further pamphlets on his plan for state pensions, but none of these have survived. He benefited from relief funds raised by radicals, but died in London on 1 June 1850 in extreme poverty. A collection financed his burial at Bunhill Fields cemetery; the funeral, attended by over 400 people, was led by Harney and Luke Hansard. He was survived by his second wife and son.<br>
