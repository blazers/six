<span class="headword">Blomfield,  Ezekiel</span>  (1778&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Independent minister and writer</span>, was born on 28 October 1778 at North Walsham, Norfolk. His parents were very poor, and in 1783 he moved with them to Norwich. He read widely, but the book that determined his lifelong studies was Anna Letitia Barbauld's <span class="italic">Evenings at Home</span> (1792&#150;6), which quickened his interest in the phenomena of nature. At about fifteen he became imbued with strong religious convictions and was placed under the care of a nonconformist minister, the Revd S. Newton of Norwich. Under his capable mastership he rapidly acquired Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. After combating old doubts, in 1796 he joined Newton's church, and, resolving to become a minister, attended the Independent Homerton Academy. After a year spent at Norwich in ill health he accepted a call to a congregation at Wymondham.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1800 Blomfield married Mary Fursnell of Hanworth, Norfolk. Soon after his marriage he delivered a course of lectures on history at Wymondham. As his family increased he eked out a slender income by hack work for Brightley, a printer at Bungay, and subsequently went into partnership with him. Pecuniary difficulties followed, and led to a move from Wymondham to Wortwell in 1809. Blomfield founded the Norfolk and Norwich Auxiliary British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1810 he projected a classical academy; he planned a history of education, and delivered a successful course of lectures on the philosophy of history from materials gathered in 1815 and 1816. He died on 14 July 1818 at Glemham, Suffolk, leaving his widow and young family of eight children totally unprovided for. His <span class="italic">Philosophy of History</span> was published in a fine quarto in 1819, with a memoir, to assist in their maintenance. It is somewhat fragmentary and commonplace. In 1807 had appeared, in two huge volumes, Blomfield's <span class="italic">A general view of the world, geographical, historical, and philosophical, on a plan entirely new</span>; this work shows wide but ill-digested reading.<br>
