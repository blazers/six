<span class="headword">Pollock, Sir  (John) Donald</span>, baronet  (1868&#150;1962), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at Galashiels on 23 November 1868, the elder surviving son of the Revd John Barr Pollock, minister of the United Presbyterian church, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Donald JP, of Edinburgh. He was educated by his father, studied science at Glasgow University, and medicine at Edinburgh where he gained his MB, CM in 1892, and MD in 1895. After qualifying he spent a year or two as a ship's doctor before setting up in practice in the Earl's Court Road, London (1895&#150;1908). He then became private medical adviser and companion to the duke of Leinster, an epileptic, with whom he travelled extensively until the outbreak of war in 1914, when they settled in Edinburgh. Pollock gave his services to the naval hospital at Granton; he was appointed OBE in 1919 and in 1922 received the honorary rank of surgeon-commander RNVR.<br>
<br>After the war and the duke's death in 1922, Pollock joined with S. J. L. Hardie and R. W. McCrone in the formation in 1922 of a ship-breaking company, Metal Industries Ltd, of which he remained chairman until 1951. In 1925 the company was asked by the Admiralty if it was interested in salvaging the sunken German ships at Scapa Flow. This task was beyond its resources and another company raised all the small ships, some of which, as well as five battleships, were purchased by Metal Industries. In 1933 Pollock's company took over the salvaging and raised another six battleships before work was stopped in 1939. In 1936 the company was able to obtain from the Admiralty a lease of part of Rosyth Dockyard which enabled it to deal with much larger ships.<br>
<br>At the outset it was realized that it was essential for the company to make its own oxygen and Pollock and McCrone went to Germany to study methods of production before a plant was set up at Charlestown on the Forth. Later they purchased the patent rights for a new method which delivered oxygen in liquid form, to be converted into gas at the user's works. Having recognized the wider applications of the new method, Pollock, who was a very good negotiator, overcame the initial reluctance of the large steel works to adopt it, and factories were opened in Sheffield and Birmingham to manufacture liquid oxygen. Alarmed at this development the British Oxygen Company raised an action against Pollock and McCrone for revocation of their patent rights. But before the case was finished British Oxygen asked Pollock and his colleagues to amalgamate with them, which they accordingly did in 1932. Pollock was chairman of British Oxygen from 1932 until 1937 when he became honorary president.<br>
<br>Although his business interests took him frequently to London, Pollock was always active in the public life of Scotland. He was, for instance, a member of the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, the Carnegie Trust for the Scottish Universities, and the economic committee of the Scottish National Development Council. In 1936 he gave &pound;250,000 to form a trust for educational and religious purposes in Scotland and a few years later he founded the &pound;70,000 Pollock Memorial Missionary Trust to provide homes for missionaries of all denominations. He was a generous benefactor of Edinburgh University, of which he was lord rector in 1939&#150;45 and where he is commemorated by the halls of residence, Pollock Halls. He received the honorary degrees of LLD from Edinburgh (1935) and DSc in 1937 from Oxford, where he had established a readership in engineering science and also enabled the Clarendon Laboratory to carry out its research into low temperatures. As a great friend of A. L. Smith he became a member of the senior common room at Balliol College. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1951 a vice-president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was created a baronet in 1939.<br>
<br>Pollock was a man of simple tastes, almost a teetotaller, and certainly a non-smoker. He spent little on himself except on etchings, of which he had one of the finest collections in the country. He had only two cars in forty years, and never had a chauffeur or even a full-time gardener. He took no interest in sports except rugby and sailing and listed as one of his recreations the &#145;nautical training of young lads&#146;, the others being gardening and engineering. He took a lot of exercise, never put on weight, and was always very fit. He died at his home, Manor House, Boswall Road, Leith, Edinburgh, on 4 June 1962. He was unmarried and the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
