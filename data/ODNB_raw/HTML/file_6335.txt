<span class="headword">Cornwall,  Charles Wolfran</span>  (1735&#150;1789), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born on 15 June 1735 and baptized ten days later at St Thomas's Church, Winchester, the only son of Jacobs Cornwall (1709/10&#150;1736), of Berrington, Herefordshire, and his wife, Rose (1706/7&#150;1783), the daughter of Robert Fowler, of Barton Priors, Hampshire. His paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6327/', "Vice-Admiral Charles Cornwall (bap. 1669, d. 1718)")</script>. Educated at Winchester School from 1748 and trained for the law at Lincoln's Inn from 1755 and Gray's Inn in 1757, he was called to the bar in 1757. He then became involved politically with his cousin Charles Jenkinson, later first earl of Liverpool, whose influence secured him the post of commissioner for examining the German accounts in 1763. The following year, on 17 August, he married Jenkinson's sister Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1730, <i>d</i>. 1809), who was the daughter of Colonel Charles Jenkinson and Amarantha Cornwall. They had no children.<br>
<br>After quitting office in 1765 Cornwall came under the influence of both Lord Rockingham and Lord Shelburne, and at the latter's recommendation he entered parliament in May 1768 as one of the MPs for Grampound, Cornwall. In the Commons he quickly established himself as a frequent and effective spokesman for the opposition, specializing in East India affairs. When Lord North offered him the opportunity to supervise and regulate the East India Company's activities in Bengal in 1773, Cornwall declined, but within a few months he succumbed to North's more attractive offer of a pension of &pound;500 from West Indies revenues. Cornwall formally crossed the floor of the house when he accepted a place at the Treasury board in 1774, and thereafter he defended the government's American policy, despite his misgivings about the conduct of the war. In October 1774 he was returned as MP for the Treasury seat of Winchelsea, which he exchanged for another Cinque Ports seat, Rye, in April 1784.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1780 Cornwall was elected speaker of the Commons and it was hoped, according to Nathaniel Wraxall, that &#145;a sonorous Voice, a manly as well as imposing Figure, and a commanding Deportment&#146; would ensure success  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 1.374&#150;5). Wraxall went on to denounce Cornwall's record as speaker and accused him of being both drunken and bored, a caricature perpetuated by the writers of the satirical <span class="italic">Rolliad</span>. This was a distorted view of Cornwall's record for, though he never achieved distinction as speaker, his frequent and well-informed interventions from the chair demonstrated initiative and judgement. He called MPs to account for unparliamentary behaviour and ruled on procedural matters, such as allowing the innovation of parliamentary questions in May 1783. Re-elected in 1784, he even had the temerity to vote against a government measure on 27 February 1786 when, after an all-night debate on a motion in favour of fortifying the dockyards, the division was tied. He also held the office of chief justice in eyre north of the Trent from 1780 until his death and was sworn of the privy council on 8 November 1780.<br>
<br>Cornwall died in office on 2 January 1789 at his house in Privy Garden, Whitehall, and was buried on 12 January at the church of St Cross Hospital, Winchester, where a monument was erected to him. One obituarist praised him for having conducted himself with &#145;an affability, dignity, and rectitude of conduct highly becoming his elevated situation&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). An aphorism conveyed to a later speaker asserted that &#145;Mr Speaker Cornwall said of his office: &#147;It is laborious, but not so painful as being forced to defend measures for which I was not properly responsible, and which I did not approve&#148;&#146;  (Sidmouth MSS).<br>
