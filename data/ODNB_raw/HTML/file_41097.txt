<span class="headword">Church,  Charles James Gregory</span>  (1942&#150;1989), <span class="occ">builder</span>, was born on 29 October 1942 in Windlesham, Surrey, the only son and younger child of Charles Church, farm labourer, of Windlesham, and his wife, Fuensanta Guisantes. He was educated at Strodes School, Egham, and studied civil engineering at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London. His interest in construction and house building became apparent very early, and by the age of eleven he had become a competent electrician and was able to wire his parents' cottage for electric light. Five years later he single-handedly built a tennis court for a neighbour. During his college vacations he worked for the Turriff construction group as a junior engineer. His construction manager, Jack Hamer, was so impressed by the house builder in the making that he lent Church the deposit money for the purchase of his first site.<br>
<br>In 1964 Church graduated and worked full-time for Turriff. A year later he moved to Laing as a junior engineer, as part of the team involved in the construction of the Wraysbury Reservoir project. Laing moved him to Doncaster in 1966 to work on a new gas pipeline. Church felt that his determination and enterprise were going both unnoticed and unrewarded, and after only six months in his new job he decided to establish his own company. In partnership with Con Burke he established the civil engineering company Burke and Church Ltd in 1967 and quickly sold his first house, at Prior Road, Camberley, Surrey. The proceeds of the sale were ploughed back into the business and used to acquire more land, including a two-acre site in Wokingham, on which sat a tumbledown cottage, in which he lived.<br>
<br>In 1967 Church married a former air hostess, Susanna Bridgette, daughter of William Simms, dairy shop manager. They had two daughters and a son. At this time Church learned a valuable business lesson. He realized that trying to establish a land bank and develop houses was tying up his dwindling cash resources. The only way forward for a small house builder was to develop an option system on difficult sites, rather than buying them outright. Church was already adept at buying sites, but he knew he could not compete with cash-rich, large house builders for land which could be easily developed. Instead he turned to tracts of land which other builders would avoid. Sites without planning consent or those which would be difficult to develop because of drainage or construction problems began to attract him, not only because they were cheap but because he could secure an option to buy at a future date for very little money. During the 1970s he not only honed these land-buying skills, but also developed his own &#145;just-in-time&#146; construction techniques more than a decade ahead of Japanese and American building companies. This entailed extremely efficient management of each construction site, to ensure that materials arrived only when they were needed and when they could be paid for. Simultaneously he recognized the need for a highly skilled, highly motivated, and loyal workforce. Although he demanded a lot from his workers, they were among the best paid in the industry. Church could also lead by example, as there was hardly a job on the site he could not do himself, and he imbued his workers with a sense of achievement and of fun. While he was developing his reputation as a consummate house builder, who provided quality, up-market homes, mainly designed in Tudor or Georgian style, Church continued to be hamstrung by a lack of cash. He solved this problem in the mid-1970s by forming a partnership with Martin Grant, another Surrey-based house builder. Grant's cash injection allowed Church to start acquiring larger sites. This enabled the company to lay the solid foundations of growth, which ultimately resulted in a stock market flotation in 1988, when 750 houses a year were being built. The stock market had not fully recovered from its crash the previous autumn and house builders were out of favour with the City. Church became frustrated by investors' lack of confidence and a year later bought back all the shares. Once more Charles Church became a private company, whose posters, prominently displayed on London underground stations, gave it a high profile.<br>
<br>In the male-dominated world of building and construction Church was unusual in that he employed a relatively high number of women in key positions. This was never a token gesture. He wanted to help people develop their intrinsic skills while at the same time encouraging them to widen their experience. He included his wife in this policy, for in the early days she was expected to do her share of the physical work, and later was encouraged to become involved in all aspects of managing a house-building company. Ultimately she became a main board director in charge of architecture, and was expected to take control of the business if anything happened to him.<br>
<br>Church was just over 6 feet tall, with long legs, broad shoulders, large eyes, and thick, brownish-red hair. He seemed to be a workaholic who believed his business was his life, but he found time to indulge his great passion for vintage aircraft. He bought a 1000 acre farm and sporting estate in Hampshire, at which he based his company for refurbishing Second World War aircraft and established his own vintage plane collection, which included various Spitfires, a Hurricane, a Mustang, an ME109, and a Lancaster bomber. He died at the controls of his beloved Mark V Spitfire, which developed engine failure and crashed near Hartley Wintney in Hampshire, on 1 July 1989. He was buried in the parish church at Windlesham, Surrey.<br>
