<span class="headword">Robertson,  Archibald</span>  (1853&#150;1931), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was the eldest son of George Samuel Robertson (1825&#150;1874) and his wife, Helen, daughter of William Charles Kerr junior, physician, of Northampton, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23787/', "Archibald Robertson")</script>, physician, of Northampton. He was born on 29 June 1853 at Sywell, Northamptonshire, where his father was curate. He was educated at Bradfield School and at Trinity College, Oxford, of which he was in turn scholar (first class, <i>literae humaniores</i>, 1876), fellow (1876&#150;86), and, after ordination (1878, 1882), dean (1879&#150;83), until his appointment as principal of Bishop Hatfield Hall, Durham (1883&#150;97). In 1897 he became principal of King's College, London, and he was vice-chancellor of London University in 1902&#150;3. From 1900 to 1902 he was Boyle lecturer. In 1903 he became bishop of Exeter, but was compelled to resign owing to ill health in 1916.<br>
<br>In 1885 Robertson married Julia Eleanor Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1925), daughter of Charles Noel Mann, rector of St Mawgan in Meneage and vicar of St Issey, Cornwall; they had three sons. Robertson received the honorary degree of DD from Durham University (1893) and of LLD from Glasgow University (1901). He was elected a fellow of King's College, London, in 1899 and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1903. He retired to Oxford in 1916, where he lived at 7 Canterbury Road. He died at home on 29 January 1931.<br>
<br>In academic life Robertson gained some reputation as a careful, fair-minded, and patient teacher and administrator, whose austerity of manner was underlaid by real kindliness, and one who, if rather a hard taskmaster of others, was no less unsparing of himself. Nor was it otherwise in a difficult diocese where he followed another head of a college (H. E. Ryle), also without parochial experience apart from early home associations, but where he had the aid of a much loved suffragan, Robert Edward Trefusis, bishop of Crediton (1897&#150;1930). His own attitude in ecclesiastical matters appears in his charges <span class="italic">English churchmanship, an invitation to brotherly union on the basis of the Book of Common Prayer</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">The Church of England</span> (1910), no less than in his handling of difficulties at Plymouth, and he exerted himself without stint in the effort to raise funds for church extension. At the Lambeth conference of 1908 he served on the committees on Christian faith and modern thought, on marriage problems, and on reunion, and was chairman of the committee on reorganization within the Anglican communion.<br>
<br>It is, however, as a contributor to patristic and historical studies that Robertson is most frequently remembered. The needs of Oxford teaching prompted the issue of a Greek text, <span class="italic">St Athanasius on the Incarnation</span> (1882; 2nd edn, based on <span class="roman">Codex Seguerianus</span>, 1893; 4th edn, 1910), and a translation (1885 [1884]; 2nd edn, revised and enlarged, 1891). The fascination of Athanasian studies led to the production while he was at Durham of a large book entitled <span class="italic">Select Writings and Letters of Athanasius</span>, with prolegomena, in Henry Wace's and Philip Schaff's <span class="roman">Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</span> (1892). If the modest preface suggests great indebtedness to the work of J. H. Newman, W. Bright, and H. M. Gwatkin, it does not conceal marked independence of judgement, and the prolegomena together with the introductions to the several books are masterly summaries of permanent value. The same features of conciseness combined with clarity of exposition are seen in his articles on <span class="roman">New Testament</span> subjects in Smith's and Hastings's dictionaries of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and in a notable study of St Augustine of Hippo written in 1901 and published in Henry Wace's and William Coleman Piercy's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Biography</span> (1911). To the Durham period belongs also his <span class="italic">Roman Claims to Supremacy</span> (1896). His appointment as Bampton lecturer (1901) afforded him an opportunity of subtle interweaving of history, political theory, and theology in a volume entitled <span class="italic">Regnum Dei</span> (published in the same year). In 1911 he published in conjunction with Alfred Plummer a commentary on the first epistle to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> in the <span class="roman">International Critical Commentary</span> series.<br>
