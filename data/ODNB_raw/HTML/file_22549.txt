<span class="headword">Porrett,  Robert</span>  (1783&#150;1868), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 22 September 1783 at the Tower of London, the son of Robert Porrett, ordnance storekeeper at the Tower. The interest he showed in his father's work prompted the War Office to offer him a post as assistant in his father's department in 1795, and he became its head when his father died. He took the opportunities afforded him by his post, and residence in the Tower, to study antiquities, and became an authority on armour. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1840, and made contributions to the society's <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> and to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>.<br>
<br>From 1811 Porrett was a member of the Spitalfields Mathematical Society, which was devoted to experimental natural philosophy, including chemistry. When, in May 1845, its dissolution became imminent, its membership was incorporated in the Royal Astronomical Society. His most noteworthy scientific achievements were, however, in chemistry, and he joined the Chemical Society on its formation in 1841, serving for many years as its treasurer.<br>
<br>Porrett's most valuable work was his contribution towards elucidating the complex chemistry of the derivatives of prussic acid (hydrocyanic acid). The older name of the acid stems from its association with the pigment Prussian blue, discovered in 1704 by a maker of artist's colours in Berlin. The Swedish chemist C. W. Scheele (1742&#150;1786) first obtained prussic acid from this pigment in 1783. When Porrett began his investigation of the acid in 1808, it had been established that it contained carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, but a difference of opinion existed among leading chemists as to whether it also contained oxygen. His specific aim was to resolve this problem.<br>
<br>In the course of his investigation, which began by boiling Prussian blue with potassium sulphide, Porrett isolated an acid, the properties of which differed from those of prussic acid. He was persuaded by some of his experiments that it was &#145;sub-oxidised prussic acid&#146;, and in conformity with the then current rules of nomenclature he called it &#145;prussous acid&#146;  (&#145;Memoir on the prussic acid&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Society of Arts</span>, 27, 1809, 89&#150;103). He was awarded the Society of Arts' silver medal for this work. Later, in the first of two papers on the subject read to the Royal Society  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 104, 1814, 527&#150;56; 105, 1815, 520&#150;30) he related his subsequent discovery that this new acid was actually a compound of prussic acid and sulphur, and renamed it &#145;sulphuretted chyazic acid&#146; (from carbon, hydrogen, and azote, an older name for nitrogen). It is now known as thiocyanic acid.<br>
<br>Some years previously the French chemist P. J. Macquer (1718&#150;1784) had obtained what became known as the &#145;yellow prussiate of potash&#146; and later as potassium ferrocyanide. By adding an acid to barium ferrocyanide Porrett obtained free ferrocyanic acid, which he called &#145;ferruretted chyazic acid&#146;. When he subjected a salt of the acid in solution to electrolysis, he found that the iron in these salts formed part of the acid radical, which migrated to the anode. This was the first known complex ion.<br>
<br>Porrett's second Royal Society paper (he was elected FRS in 1848) describes attempts at an analysis of ferrocyanides and thiocyanates, but his techniques were not good enough to obtain accurate results. Of his other papers, the most important is that in which he rediscovered electroendosmosis  (&#145;Curious galvanic experiments&#146;, <span class="italic">Annals of Philosophy</span>, 8, 1816, 150&#150;1). He observed the movement of a liquid through an apparently impervious partition, when a potential difference was applied across two electrodes, one on each side of the partition. He would certainly have been unaware that this had been observed some years previously by the German chemist F. F. von Reuss (1778&#150;1852).<br>
<br>Porrett retired from the Ordnance in 1850, and died at his home, 49 Bernard Street, Russell Square, London, on 25 November 1868. He was unmarried. Robert Porrett Collier, Lord Monkswell, was his nephew.<br>
