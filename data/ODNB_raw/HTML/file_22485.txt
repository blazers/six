<span class="headword">Pomfret,  John</span>  (1667&#150;1702), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Luton, Bedfordshire, the son of Thomas Pomfret (<i>d</i>. 1705) and his wife, Catherine, daughter of William Dobson of St Andrew's, Holborn, London. A graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1655&#150;6; MA, 1661), Thomas Pomfret served as vicar of Luton (1666&#150;79), prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral (1685&#150;1705), rector of Maulden (1689&#150;94), and chaplain to Robert Bruce, earl of Ailesbury. He was the author of an assize sermon, <span class="italic">Subjection for Conscience-Sake Asserted</span> (1682), preached at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, on 11 March 1682. His son, John, studied at Bedford grammar school before matriculating as a sizar at Queens' College, Cambridge, on 27 November 1680. He graduated BA in 1684/5 and MA in 1688. At Luton on 13 September 1692 Pomfret married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of George Wingate of Lewsey Manor, Bedfordshire. Ordained into the Church of England, Pomfret was appointed curate of Maulden in 1687 and rector on 12 December 1695. He shared his father's dislike of nonconformity and was annoyed when people confused him with the dissenting minister Samuel Pomfret.<br>
<br>Pomfret's earliest known poems were &#145;An Epistle to Charles, Earl of Dorset&#146; (1690) and &#145;A Pastoral Essay on the Death of Queen Mary, anno 1694&#146;, which exalts emotion:<blockquote>
<div>So great a Loss as this deserves Excess<br>
</div>
<div>Of Sorrow, all's too little, that is less.<br>
</div> (Pomfret, 48)</blockquote>In 1699 he completed a collection of verse; published as <span class="italic">Miscellany Poems on Several Occasions</span>, it reached the eleventh edition in 1748. Finding tragedy in the rebellion of the duke of Monmouth, &#145;the brave, betray'd, unhappy Man&#146;, Pomfret poignantly describes his followers' fate in &#145;Cruelty and Lust&#146;. Whereas the vanquished found pardon following David's triumph over Absalom, James II's troops were<blockquote>
<div>sagacious Blood-Hounds, skill'd too well<br>
</div>
<div>In all the murd'ring Qualities of Hell.<br>
</div> (ibid., 59, 62)</blockquote>Love is Pomfret's theme in a number of poems, and in &#145;Upon the Divine Attributes, a Pindaric Essay&#146;, he meditates on God's unity, eternity, power, wisdom, providence, omnipresence, immutability, justice, and goodness. Like many contemporary religious authors, Pomfret was intrigued by eschatology, the subject of &#145;On the general conflagration and ensuing judgment, a Pindaric essay&#146;, which depicts hell as &#145;the vast Abyss of endless Woes&#146;  (ibid., 116), and &#145;Dies novissima, or, The epiphany: a Pindarick ode, on Christ's second appearance to judge the world&#146;.<br>
<br>Pomfret's best-known poems were <span class="italic">The Choice: a Poem</span> (1700, though it appeared in December 1699) and <span class="italic">Reason: a Poem</span> (1700). Adapting the &#145;Bonheur de ce monde&#146; theme in <span class="italic">The Choice</span>, Pomfret exalts the genteel country life, eschewing extremes, valuing the utilitarian, and shunning those who are &#145;busy Medlers with Intrigues of State&#146;. One's library must be well stocked with Horace, Virgil, Juvenal, and Ovid, and one's cellar with fine wine and ale, though inebriety is unacceptable. Money must be plentiful enough to assist friends and relieve the indigent. Although Pomfret recommends the single life, the company of &#145;some obliging Modest-Fair&#146; woman is essential. <span class="italic">Reason</span> is an unrelenting critique of the limits of human rationality, with barbs directed against Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, &#145;the noisie Jargon of the Schools&#146;, physicians (&#145;What Health can That contentious Tribe Impart?&#146;), and even tradition, which makes us &#145;Debtors to the famous Dead&#146;.<br>
<br>Some time after his appointment as rector of Millbrook, Bedfordshire, on 2 June 1702, Pomfret went to London, seeking a lucrative preferment from Bishop Henry Compton. Reportedly displeased with Pomfret's purported sanctioning of a mistress in <span class="italic">The Choice</span>, Compton delayed an appointment. While in London Pomfret contracted smallpox and, in November, died; he was buried at Maulden on 1 December 1702. His sole surviving son, John, was baptized at Maulden on 21 August 1702, appointed Rouge Croix pursuivant of arms on 26 July 1725, and died on 24 March 1751. Pomfret was also survived by his widow, Elizabeth, and their daughter (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1696). Elizabeth and Michael Arnald of Ampthill, Bedfordshire, were the administrators of his will. Thinking Pomfret had &#145;been always the favourite of that class of readers who, without vanity or criticism, seek only their own amusement&#146;, Samuel Johnson included him in the <span class="italic">Lives of the English Poets</span> (1.265). However, Pomfret never attained the stature of a major poet. In &#145;The Choice&#146;, Leigh Hunt depicted him as a pastry chef who created verse out of insignificant materials:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">There's a skill<br>
</div>
<div>In pies, in raising crusts as well as galleries.<br>
</div> (in Fussell, 191)</blockquote>
