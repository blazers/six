<span class="headword">Barling, Sir  (Harry) Gilbert</span>, baronet  (1855&#150;1940), <span class="occ">surgeon and academic administrator</span>, the fourth son of William Barling (<i>d</i>. 1896), farmer and veterinary surgeon, of Newnham-on-Severn, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Eliza Sharpe, was born at Newnham-on-Severn on 30 April 1855. Barling was educated at a boarding-school at Weston, near Bath. The agricultural depression prevented him from succeeding his father as a farmer, and the family lacked the money necessary to fund his medical training. When almost sixteen, Barling was therefore apprenticed to a chemist in Manchester, where he learned little of value and was used by his principal as a drudge and errand-boy. Nevertheless, he qualified as a chemist and passed the matriculation examination of London University.<br>
<br>In 1874 Barling became a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where lack of funds compelled him to take part-time employment. Finding that this occupied too much of his time, he began to coach younger students. One of his pupils was the son of a Birmingham surgeon, who so much appreciated the kindness shown to his son that he promised to help Barling if the opportunity ever arose. Shortly after graduating MB from London in 1879, Barling made use of this contact and managed to obtain the appointment of resident pathologist at the General Hospital, Birmingham. On 21 October 1885 he married Katharine Jaffray (<i>d</i>. 1920), second daughter of Henry Edmunds, bank manager at Edgbaston; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Elected FRCS in 1881, Barling was appointed assistant surgeon at Birmingham in 1885, and full surgeon in 1891, a position which he occupied until his retirement in 1915, when he was appointed consulting surgeon. While an assistant surgeon, Barling drew up a scheme for rebuilding the hospital which was accepted and used in the construction of the new General Hospital, opened in 1897.<br>
<br>Barling's association with the University of Birmingham was as important as that with the General Hospital. In 1885 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at Queen's College, where the medical school was based until its transfer to Mason College, the precursor of the university. He was the first holder of the chair of pathology, to which he was appointed in 1886, and in 1893 he was made professor of surgery. After seven years' tenure of the deanship of the medical faculty, he resigned it in 1912, and the following year was elected vice-chancellor (a title changed to pro-chancellor in 1927); he held this office for twenty years, during which time under his guidance the university research departments in mental diseases and cancer were founded. As a result of his financial skill and ability to influence generous donors, the university, when he retired, was free from debt, and had a greatly increased income, despite the great developments in staffing and in buildings which had taken place during his tenure of office.<br>
<br>Apart from the period between October 1916 and August 1917, when he was consulting surgeon in France, Barling was consulting surgeon to the southern command of the British army during the First World War. For these services he was twice mentioned in dispatches, was appointed CB in 1917 and CBE in 1919, and in the latter year was created a baronet.<br>
<br>Barling took a leading part in the early negotiations for the union of the two voluntary teaching hospitals in Birmingham&#151;Queen's and the General&#151;into one body, the United Hospital, and he was also chairman of the committee which launched the Hospitals Centre Scheme. This scheme planned the building of a hospital teaching centre and a new medical school in close proximity to the main university buildings at Edgbaston. Unfortunately, in 1926, a serious illness forced Barling's retirement from the committee, but he lived to see the first part of the scheme completed and the opening of a large new general hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, as well as a well-equipped medical school. Although Barling retired from the active staff in 1915 he maintained an interest in the General Hospital and was its president for four years (1924&#150;7).<br>
<br>Barling was a hard worker and talented administrator, teacher, and speaker. His record of hospital, university, and other public service was recognized in 1935 by the presentation of the gold medal of the Birmingham Civic Society; the university conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD in 1937. Barling died at his home, 6 Manor Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 27 April 1940.<br>
