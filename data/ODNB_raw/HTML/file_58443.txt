<span class="headword">Collier, Sir  George Ralph</span>, baronet  (1774&#150;1824), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London, the second son of Ralph Collier, chief clerk of the victualling office. Educated at the Chelsea Maritime Academy, he went to sea in HMS <i>Carysfort</i> in 1787 already a capable navigator, astronomer, surveyor, and linguist. Commissioned lieutenant on 22 January 1796, he was first lieutenant of the flagship of Admiral Mitchell at the capture of the Dutch fleet at The Helder in 1799. He brought home Mitchell's dispatches, and was promoted commander on 3 September; he was then appointed to command the 18 gun <i>Victor</i>. After escorting a troop convoy to the Red Sea coast of Egypt, Collier engaged the French 18 gun <i>Fl&egrave;che</i> off the Seychelles on 2 September 1801 until heavy damage to his rigging allowed it to escape. Collier followed, after completing his repairs. On 5 September, the <i>Fl&egrave;che</i> was sighted entering Mahe, and after surveying the entrance at night Collier sailed into the harbour, anchored, and reduced the French ship to a beached wreck. Only two of his men were wounded. The first lord of the Admiralty, Earl St Vincent, highly approving his conduct, promoted him captain on 20 April 1802, to ensure his precedence over a large block promotion given at the peace. In addition to his well-earned naval support Collier was also a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Prince William of Gloucester. On 18 May 1805 Collier married Maria Lyon of Liverpool; there were no children. While on shore he proposed an operation to block the Texel, where he had been active in 1799.<br>
<br>From February 1806 Collier commanded the frigate <i>Minerva</i> on the north coast of Spain, conducting cutting-out attacks on Spanish privateers and forts. In April 1807 he moved into HMS <i>Surveillante</i>. In the same year he brought home Admiral Gambier's dispatches from the Copenhagen expedition, and was knighted. Collier returned to the Bay of Biscay, capturing a French corvette and four privateers, and harassing French coastal shipping. In 1812 Collier operated on the north coast of Spain, under Admiral Sir Home Popham, supporting the Spanish guerrillas. On 1 August he captured the castle at Santander, but was wounded and forced to withdraw. Two days later the French evacuated the vital position. In 1813 Collier was a commodore with twelve vessels, supporting the Spanish along the coast. He also co-operated with General Sir Thomas Graham at the capture of San Sebastian in August.<br>
<br>In November 1813 Collier was moved into the new 50 gun <i>Leander</i>, specially built to counter successful American heavy frigates like the <i>Constitution</i>. After arriving on the American coast he captured the brig USS <i>Rattlesnake</i>, on 22 June 1814, and blockaded the <i>Constitution</i> in Boston. While Collier was taking on stores at Halifax his quarry escaped, and he pursued her across the Atlantic, taking a large privateer on passage and picking up intelligence. On 11 March 1815, two months after the treaty of Ghent had ended the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, Collier&#151;who did not know this&#151;with the <i>Newcastle</i>, another new 50 gun frigate, and the 40 gun <i>Acasta</i>, encountered the <i>Constitution</i> beating out of Porto Praya in the Cape Verde Islands, with the prize sloops <i>Cyane</i> and <i>Levant</i> in company. In the fog the captains of the other two ships mistook the two smaller ships for frigates, while Collier never obtained clear sight of them. When a signal directing <i>Acasta</i> to pursue <i>Levant</i> fouled on hoisting, it was followed by <i>Newcastle</i> as well. The squadron finally pursued <i>Levant</i> back to Porto Praya, where she was recaptured. The <i>Constitution</i> escaped, but Collier quickly moved to a position off Cayenne, where he expected to intercept her. He abandoned this position when he heard of the peace; two days later the Americans passed, as he had expected. Collier's distinguished services earned him a baronetcy on 20 September 1814, and he was created KCB on 2 January 1815.<br>
<br>Between 1818 and 1821 Collier commanded the six-ship coast of Africa squadron, to suppress the slave trade. He carried out this task with the vigour of a convinced abolitionist, significantly reducing the large-scale shipment of slaves. His reports, produced for the House of Commons, were widely consulted. In 1820 his work was recognized by election to honorary life membership of the African Institution. Mortified by William James's account of his action with <i>Constitution</i> in the <span class="italic">Naval Occurrences of the War of 1812</span>, which implied incompetence at the least, Collier requested an Admiralty rebuttal. When this was denied, &#145;in a fit of insanity&#146;, he cut his throat, on 24 March 1824  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 284). After his death his conduct was stoutly defended by the naval biographer John Marshall. American accounts agree with Marshall that the weather was too thick for a positive identification of the ships.<br>
<br>A brave, resourceful, and effective sea officer, Collier was denied by early death the opportunity to distinguish himself in peacetime commands, and the service was deprived of one of its brightest ornaments. His baronetcy became extinct on his death, and his suicide may account for his omission from the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
