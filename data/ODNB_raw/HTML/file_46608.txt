<span class="headword">Baxendale,  Lloyd Henry</span>  (1858&#150;1937), <span class="occ">road transport entrepreneur</span>, was born on 3 February 1858 at Totteridge, Hertfordshire, the eldest son of Lloyd Baxendale, gentleman, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner. Although born into an active transport dynasty, his education was that of a member of the upper class, Eton College being followed by Christ Church, Oxford. He married Constance Louisa, daughter of Charles Raymond Pelly, and they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Baxendale's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37164/', "Joseph Baxendale")</script>, son of a Lancaster physician, had become a partner of Pickfords' road- and canal-carrying business in 1817. Harry Baxendale, as he was usually known, whose father was Joseph's second son, was one of three members of the third generation of Baxendales to join the Pickfords' business: he entered the firm in 1879, and was preceded by his older cousin, Joseph William (1871), the only son of Joseph's eldest son, and followed by his younger brother, Frank (1884). By a partnership agreement of 1894, eight shares were allocated to Joseph William as senior partner, six to Harry, and three to Frank. Capital was distributed in similar proportions in 1901 when the firm converted to limited liability.<br>
<br>Joseph William's tenure as chairman of the limited company was short. The firm's link to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) as its cartage agents was broken in 1901, apparently as the result of Pickfords' resentment of what was seen as the restrictive and ungenerous attitude of the railway company. However, this adversely affected Pickfords' position and, following a family row, Joseph William resigned and withdrew his capital. A cartage agreement with the new Great Central Railway Company did not provide an adequate alternative, especially at a time when capital for conversion to mechanical transport was required by Pickfords.<br>
<br>On succeeding as chairman, Harry Baxendale presided over this difficult transitional period of the establishment of mechanical transport in the company's service. Steam vehicles were Pickfords' first choice. They purchased eleven Hindley wagons (made in Bourton, Dorset) in 1905, and brought in, as engineer, William Elliott, who remained with Pickfords to become manager of the heavy haulage department, chief engineer, and, finally, general manager of Pickfords and Hay's Wharf Cartage Company.<br>
<br>Motorization was expensive and Pickfords were financially weak, following their break with the LNWR and J. W. Baxendale's retirement and withdrawal of his capital. In these circumstances, amalgamation with their major cartage rival, Carter Paterson &amp; Co., came about in 1912. Harry Baxendale became chairman of the joint company, but &#145;although face was saved to some extent &hellip; the real power lay with the Patersons&#146;  (Turnbull, <span class="italic">Traffic and Transport</span>, 156). Some progress with rationalization was made before the First World War intervened; Carter Paterson and the former Beans Express (another road carrying company) took over London and suburban parcels traffic, but Pickfords retained their provincial strength and heavy haulage specialism.<br>
<br>This aspect of Pickfords' operations prospered with the increased demand for the transport of heavy war <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>, whereas Carter Paterson's parcels trade collapsed. In 1920 the Pickfords' side of the combine's operation attracted a successful bid from the Hay's Wharf Cartage Company. Baxendale ceded the chairmanship of Pickfords to Major O. C. Magniac of Hay's Wharf, but, together with James Paterson, remained a director and joined the board of Hay's Wharf Cartage. After lengthy negotiations, on 1 July 1933 Hay's Wharf Cartage, Pickfords, and Carter Paterson were acquired by the four main-line railway companies. Although James Paterson remained in power at Carter Paterson, and W. J. Elliott of Pickfords became general manager of Pickfords and Hay's Wharf Cartage, Baxendale, who was by then seventy-five, resigned in December 1933.<br>
<br>Baxendale's Berkshire home, Greenham Lodge, near Newbury, provided the focus for quite different business interests. In addition to his other interests, Baxendale served as chairman of the Newbury Racecourse Company, formed in 1905; the grandstands of the course were built on former Greenham Lodge estate land, and when George V and Queen Mary visited the Newbury races he personally received them. Local affairs also occupied Baxendale, as JP, a Conservative county councillor for six years from 1889, and churchwarden of his local church. Baxendale died on 21 May 1937 at his home; the funeral took place at Greenham church, where he was buried, and he was survived by his wife.<br>
