<span class="headword">O'Higgins,  Ambrosio</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ambrose Higgins]</span>, marquess of Osorno in the Spanish nobility  (<em>c.</em>1721&#150;1801), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial administrator in the Spanish service</span>, was born Ambrose Higgins at Ballynary, co. Sligo, one of several children of Charles Higgins and his wife, Margaret, daughter of William O'Higgins and his wife, Winifred. In a pedigree supplied by the obliging Ulster king of arms in 1788 he was certified as being of noble ancestry but this seems incorrect. The details of his early life are obscure. At some stage, possibly in his youth, the family seems to have moved to Summerhill in co. Meath. Though his parents' circumstances appear to have been comparatively humble they were sufficient to pay for his education, which, to judge from his career, must have been to a good standard, especially in mathematics. Possibly he trained as a surveyor or draughtsman. He was reported late in life to have said that he served for a time in the English army but this seems unlikely as his background was Irish and, he claimed, pro-Jacobite. The traditional account that he was educated for the priesthood in Spain seems to be contradicted by his own statement that he went to Spain in 1751 to work in Cadiz for the Irish merchant firm of Butler. On its behalf he undertook a commercial journey to South America in 1756, taking the opportunity to visit his younger brother William, a former clerical student then living in Paraguay with his wife and two children.<br>
<br>In 1761 Higgins became a naturalized Spanish citizen and was commissioned as an engineer&#150;draughtsman with the rank of lieutenant in the Spanish corps of military engineers. His appointment was assisted by John Garland, a Hispano-Irish engineer officer whom he accompanied to Chile in 1764, when Garland was appointed military governor of Valdivia. While crossing the Andes Higgins conceived the idea of improving the route from Mendoza to Santiago by constructing a chain of brick-built shelters. He directed this work so efficiently that by 1766 an all-year postal service was operating between the Atlantic coast and Chile, whereas previously communications had been impossible in winter. He returned to Spain, and in 1768 wrote a <span class="italic">Description of the Realm of Chile</span>, a well-informed memorandum with recommendations on a wide range of topics including agriculture, commerce, administration, and relations with the Indian population.<br>
<br>On his return to Chile Don Ambrosio, as he was known, was promoted steadily, becoming captain of dragoons in 1770, captain of cavalry in 1771, lieutenant-colonel and commander of cavalry in 1773, colonel in 1777, brigadier-general in 1783, commandant-general in 1780, major-general in 1789, and lieutenant-general in 1794. In the 1770s he successfully commanded troops against the Llanos and Pehuenches Indians of Araucan&iacute;a. He founded the fort of San Carlos and displayed considerable valour and leadership skills in a campaign during which he was twice wounded. His fair treatment of the Indians after their defeat ensured the future peace of the region. In 1778 he was appointed delegate-general of the forces in Chile. While <i>intendant</i> of Concepci&oacute;n he entertained with great courtesy the French circumnavigator Galaup de la P&eacute;rouse.<br>
<br>In 1787 Higgins was made governor and captain-general of Chile, and received a triumphant welcome in Santiago. He proved a vigorous and capable administrator, building roads and coastal fortifications, and founding or re-founding towns such as Los Andes, Osorno, and San Ambrosio de Ballenar, which he named after his birthplace. He improved the sanitation and water supply of Santiago and constructed dykes and jetties along the R&iacute;o Ma&iacute;po to preserve the city from flooding. He introduced reforms to taxation and public administration. He abolished the cruel <i>encomienda</i> system, whereby landowners kept Indian labourers in conditions close to slavery, and pushed forward reforms in the church to benefit the poor. His 1793 settlement with the Indians at the congress of La Laja laid the foundation for assimilation between colonists and natives. By about 1788 he had adopted O'Higgins as his name. In 1795 he was created baron of Ballenary and appointed viceroy of Peru, becoming marquess of Osorno in 1796. In Peru he continued to build roads and improved the coastal fortifications at Callao and Pisco, following the outbreak of war with England. Early in his viceroyalty he befriended his fellow countryman John Mackenna (1771&#150;1814), who thus commenced a distinguished career under his auspices.<br>
<br>O'Higgins never married but a liaison with Mar&iacute;a Isabel Riquelme de la Barrera y Meza (1759&#150;1839), the eighteen-year-old daughter of a respectable Creole family, resulted in the birth in 1778 of a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98242/', "Bernardo O'Higgins")</script>. Mar&iacute;a Isabel married in 1780 Felix Rodriguez y Riquelme. O'Higgins paid for his son's education in England and left him property in his will but otherwise their relationship was not close. Several of his nephews also served in the Spanish army, of whom Demetrius and Thomas O'Higgins, sons of his brother Thomas, joined him in South America and were beneficiaries under his will.<br>
<br>Aged about eighty, O'Higgins died suddenly at Lima, after a short illness, on 19 March 1801 and was interred in the church of San Pedro in Lima. Though stern and serious in character he was nicknamed &#145;the Shrimp&#146; on account of his high complexion. His son, Bernardo O'Higgins, subsequently commanded the patriot army in the Chilean War of Independence, became president of the congress, and is regarded as the emancipator of his country.<br>
