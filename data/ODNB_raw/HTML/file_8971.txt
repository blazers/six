<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>John Evans Eglwysbach]</span>  (1840&#150;1897), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister</span>, was the eldest son of David and Margaret Evans of T&#375; Du, a small farm in the parish of Eglwys-bach, Denbighshire, where he was born on 28 September 1840. The name of his native parish became associated with him, and was the name by which he was popularly known in Wales. He was educated at the national school of the parish and, after leaving, he acted as his father's shepherd, using his spare time for private study. At the age of seventeen, he began preaching, and soon became a well-known and popular preacher with his congregations. He was accepted for the ministry in 1860, but owing to ill health was unable to proceed to a theological college. His first appointment was as a local preacher in Anglesey in 1861, before he moved to Mold in 1863, and was fully ordained in 1865. He moved on to minister at the following circuits: Liverpool (1866); Bethesda (1869); Liverpool (1872&#150;8); London (1878&#150;86); Bangor (1886&#150;9); Oswestry (1889&#150;90); and Islington, London (1890&#150;93). He also visited the USA on extensive preaching tours in 1873 and 1887. During his earlier ministries in Liverpool and London he strove to compensate for his lack of collegiate training by attending evening classes, becoming an associate of King's College, London. In 1884 he was elected a member of the legal hundred of the Wesleyan conference, and in 1895 became chairman of the South Wales district. During the last four years of his life he organized and vigorously conducted a &#145;forward movement&#146; mission in Glamorgan, its headquarters being at Pontypridd. So successful did his work prove that arrangements had been made to enable him to exchange it in another year for that of peripatetic evangelist for the whole of Wales, but the strain of the Glamorgan mission proved too great. Early in 1897 he had to abandon all his literary work, but he did not reduce his ministerial role, and on 23 October 1897 he died suddenly of heart failure at St Domingo Vale in Liverpool (where he had gone to preach); he was buried there on 27 October at Anfield cemetery.<br>
<br>Evans was married twice: first, in 1873, to Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1884), daughter of John Pritchard of Liverpool; and second, in 1886, to Clara Kate, daughter of James Richardson of Duke Street, Manchester Square, London. His second wife, by lecturing and conducting mission services, shared the burden of her husband's evangelistic work. Both she and a family of six children survived him. He was commemorated at Pontypridd by a memorial chapel, erected by public subscriptions drawn from all parts of Wales.<br>
<br>Eglwysbach takes rank among the greatest of Welsh pulpit orators, and was probably the most eloquent that Wesleyan Methodism produced in nineteenth-century Wales. While in Liverpool he was often described as &#145;the Welsh Spurgeon&#146;, but in his style of preaching he resembled William Morley Punshon more closely. A contemporary commented that &#145;his power as a preacher of the gospel is well known in England and America, but especially in the Principality &hellip; the church at Eglwysbach will ever have reason to be proud that it brought up one of the ablest preachers in the Welsh language&#146;  (D. Young, <span class="italic">The Origin and History of Methodism in Wales</span>, 1893, 451). His missionary zeal and great charm made him an influential figure, and it was said that he converted thousands during the course of his life.<br>
<br>Evans had strong literary tastes, and his output as a Welsh-language writer was considerable, given his activity as preacher and lecturer. His most important work was a Welsh biography of John Wesley (1880), a revised translation of whose sermons he also brought out in 1887. He published three volumes of sermons and contributed largely to the magazines of his own connexion, and edited <span class="italic">Y Winllan</span> (1878&#150;9) and <span class="italic">Y Fwyell</span> (1894&#150;7), a monthly journal connected to the Pontypridd mission. In the latter appeared in 1896&#150;7 a long series of autobiographical chapters which he did not live to complete.<br>
