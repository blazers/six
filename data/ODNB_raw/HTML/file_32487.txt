<span class="headword">Colebrook,  Leonard</span>  (1883&#150;1967), <span class="occ">bacteriologist</span>, was born in Guildford, Surrey, on 2 March 1883, the fifth child and third son of six children born to May Colebrook, a prosperous farmer and nonconformist preacher, and his second wife, Mary Gower. He was educated from 1891 to 1896 at Guildford grammar school, from 1896 to 1899 at Westbourne high school, Bournemouth, and from then for one year at Christ's College, Blackheath, London. In 1900 he began premedical studies at the London Hospital medical college, from which he won an entrance scholarship at St Mary's Hospital, London, where he graduated MB, BS in 1906.<br>
<br>Colebrook's decision to go into medicine was apparently prompted by the nonconformist social conscience of the Colebrook family. Indeed, he first intended to become a medical missionary. But he was much impressed by the lectures in pathology and bacteriology of Sir Almroth E. Wright, and one year after graduation he accepted an appointment as assistant in the inoculation department of St Mary's Hospital medical school. There he worked partly on the vaccine therapy pursued by Wright; however, his second publication, in 1911, with Alexander Fleming, was on the treatment of syphilis with Paul Erlich's arsenical, salvarsan. On the outbreak of war in 1914 Colebrook became a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and worked on wound infections, first at St Mary's Hospital and later in Almroth Wright's laboratory at no. 13 general hospital in Boulogne.<br>
<br>Also in 1914 Colebrook married Dorothy Scarlett, daughter of John Scarlett Campbell, of the Indian Civil Service and judge of the high court at Lahore. She died in 1941, and in 1946 he married Vera Scovell, daughter of Thomas James Locke, a civil servant. She was a war widow working as a freelance broadcaster. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>In 1919 Colebrook was appointed a member of the scientific staff of the Medical Research Council and worked on dental caries, but early in 1922 he was seconded to work again with Wright at St Mary's. It was under Wright that he developed his skill as a bacteriologist. Despite the contrast in their personalities and beliefs, the two men became close friends and Colebrook's loyalty and admiration for his old teacher lasted throughout his life. He published a biography of Wright in 1954.<br>
<br>In the mid 1920s Colebrook began the study of puerperal fever for which he is probably best known. Vera Colebrook has written that he was set on this course by the death of the wife of a close friend from a streptococcal infection in childbirth and by the suffering which followed. Wright's vaccine therapy was ineffective against these dangerous infections, which at that time contributed to many cases of maternal mortality, and treatment with arsenicals was of relatively little value. When, in 1930, Colebrook became honorary director of the research laboratories of Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, he undertook a thorough investigation of the origins of infection in the labour wards and became a vigorous proponent of an aseptic regimen by which it might be reduced. In 1935 his attention was drawn to a German paper by Gerhard Domagk, reporting that a red dye, prontosil, could cure infection with virulent haemolytic streptococci. By the following year Colebrook and his colleagues had confirmed these findings and shown that the drug was effective in a number of cases of puerperal fever. With the subsequent use of sulphanilamide, the active fragment of prontosil which was produced from it <i>in vivo</i>, and then of other sulphonamides, the death rate in the isolation block of the hospital fell from 30 to 4 per cent. The life-saving power of the sulphonamides in human medicine was thus established.<br>
<br>In 1939 Colebrook went to France as a colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps and bacteriological consultant to the British expeditionary force. There he became aware of the distressing prevalence of infected burns in mechanized warfare. After his return to England in 1940 he began work on the infection and treatment of burns, and showed that infection could be controlled by sulphonamides and, in a later study, by penicillin. He renewed a much earlier interest in skin-grafting and consulted Peter Medawar in Oxford, to whom he introduced the problems of tissue rejection. From 1942 to 1948 he was director of the Burns Investigation Unit of the Medical Research Council, and was first based at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and then at the Birmingham Accident Hospital. He developed ideas on the airborne transfer of infection and on procedures for asepsis during dressing, and from the start fought doggedly for changes in handling the problems of sepsis and for other causes in which he believed. Many of his patients with burns were young children. For more than ten years after 1946, with the support of his wife Vera, he was a persistent propagandist of measures to prevent burns to both children and old people in the home. His unit had acquired an outstanding reputation when he retired in 1948.<br>
<br>Colebrook was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1944 and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1945. He received an honorary degree of DSc from the University of Birmingham in 1950 and became an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in the same year. A variety of other honours came to him, including the Blair Bell medal of the Royal Society of Medicine (1954) and the Jenner medal (1962). Nevertheless, he was a man of true modesty. He insisted that he deserved no special recognition and that what had been achieved had come from the work of a team of people, and he made special mention of the contributions of his younger sister, Dora, herself a bacteriologist, and of Ronald Hare.<br>
<br>Colebrook, known as Coli to his friends and colleagues, was impelled by compassion for the sick. During his working life there were major discoveries in chemotherapy and he dedicated himself to their application in the treatment of life-threatening bacterial infections for which no effective remedy previously had been known. In the last phase of his life he was a supporter of the Euthanasia Society. He felt that there were situations in which people had the right to end their own lives, and also that the first duty of a doctor was to relieve suffering, even if life were thereby curtailed.<br>
<br>Colebrook was a small slim man, whose outdoor recreations included skiing and gardening. He could sometimes give the impression of severity, but the enduring memories of his friends were of his transparent honesty, his sense of humour, his humanity, and his generosity. He was not outstanding as a scientist or an originator, and certainly never thought of himself in this light, but he was a man who unremittingly used his energy and ability to confer great medical benefits on those of his generation. He died at Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, on 29 September 1967, survived by his wife.<br>
