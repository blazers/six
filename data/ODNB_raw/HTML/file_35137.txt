<span class="headword">Mowatt, Sir  Francis</span>  (1837&#150;1919), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in New South Wales, Australia, on 27 April 1837, the only son of Francis Mowatt (1803&#150;1891), MP for Falmouth (1847&#150;52) and for Cambridge (1854&#150;7), and his wife, Sarah Sophia, daughter of Captain Barnes of Romford, Essex, of the East India Company's marine service. His sister Jane was married to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53968/', "Vernon Lushington (1832&#150;1912)")</script>, permanent secretary to the Admiralty (1849&#150;77).<br>
<br>Mowatt was educated at Harrow School (1851&#150;3) and Winchester College, and went to St John's College, Oxford, in March 1855, but left after a year, having received a nomination to compete for a Treasury clerkship. In one of the first limited competitive examinations conducted by the newly established civil service commission he easily beat the other nominee, but scored only 880 marks out of a possible 1545. His annual salary as a third-class clerk was &pound;100, rising to &pound;250.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1864, at the age of twenty-seven, and with a salary of &pound;430, he married Lucy Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter of John Andrew Frerichs of Thirlestaine Hall, Cheltenham, and widow of Count Stenbock of Kolk, Estonia. The couple had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Mowatt spent the whole of his career at the Treasury, reaching the top position of permanent secretary in 1895. He was made CB in 1884, advanced to KCB in 1893, and was created GCB in 1901. Three years after his retirement in 1903 he was sworn of the privy council. In forty-seven years in the department he made steady but unspectacular progress through the ranks, his career and contribution overshadowed by his brilliant older contemporary Reginald Welby, who had joined the Treasury in the same year, and, in his later years, by the younger Edward Hamilton. Unlike either, Mowatt was never chosen to serve as private secretary to Treasury ministers. He spent all of his early and middle career in the divisions, and in those where the opportunities to make a mark or to show potential were far fewer. Where Welby and Hamilton each in turn acquired the reputation of the Treasury's financial expert, Mowatt languished in the dull routine of controlling the expenditure of law courts and the justice system. He was promoted second-class clerk in 1860, and ten years later first-class clerk in the assistant secretary's division, with a salary of &pound;700 rising to &pound;900. He was promoted principal clerk in charge of that division in 1881, by which time Welby had been promoted over the heads of seven of his seniors to the position of deputy head of the department. That position Mowatt reached in July 1888, at the age of fifty-one, and as assistant secretary and auditor of the civil list, with a salary of &pound;1500. As such he was Welby's deputy, and was appointed permanent secretary on the latter's retirement in 1895. Sir George Murray, a junior colleague who later succeeded him as permanent secretary, remembered &#145;a keen sense of humour, a genial cynicism, unfailing good temper, and a sagacious appreciation of what was feasible&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). There was at that time less obvious friction between the Treasury and the spending ministries, the long-running debate over the nature and effectiveness of its control of expenditure having temporarily subsided after the inquiry of the Ridley commission of 1887.<br>
<br>Mowatt was due to retire in 1902 at the age of sixty-five, but was persuaded to stay on for a further year, partly because of the failing health of Sir Edward Hamilton, who had been groomed for the succession. The post of permanent secretary was divided between them&#151;Mowatt as joint permanent (administrative) secretary, Hamilton as joint permanent (financial) secretary&#151;thus establishing the precedent to be followed until the appointment of Sir Warren Fisher in 1919.<br>
<br>Mowatt's deferred retirement was also owed partly to political expedience. With some relish he became embroiled in that episode for which he is perhaps best remembered. At the end of a long and distinguished career it is perhaps unfortunate that his name became indissolubly linked with the political manoeuvring over free trade which divided Balfour's cabinet. Steeped in the tradition of financial orthodoxy and free trade which characterized the stance of the Treasury and most of its senior officials throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, he was, if anything, more passionately committed to the doctrines of Gladstonian Liberalism than Welby. In his last year of office that commitment led him to compromise his position as the impartial head of the department. The chancellor, Charles Ritchie, was convinced that the corn duty introduced by his predecessor, Hicks Beach, in the budget of 1902 should be withdrawn. The fiscal strategy underlying that budget had been devised largely by Sir Edward Hamilton and his deputy, Robert Chalmers, in a fit of protectionist apostasy which both soon regretted. Ritchie's attempt to repeal the corn duty was defeated in cabinet, and he and his Treasury officials then &#145;worked hard to pull the mat from under Chamberlain's feet&#146;  (Roseveare, 222). Mowatt and other Treasury officials now openly canvassed support for Ritchie among the members of the government. &#145;In resisting Chamberlain Mowatt was not content, as were his senior colleagues, merely to stiffen the Chancellor Charles Ritchie through the medium of private counsel. &hellip; He remonstrated face-to-face with Chamberlain on the streets&#146; and &#145;schooled the young Conservative M.P. Winston Churchill in the name of the anti-protectionist cause&#146;  (Barberis, 10), something he was to do on several occasions subsequently, to the detriment of Balfour's government  (Gilbert, 154). The corn duty was withdrawn in the budget of 1903. Balfour regarded Mowatt's behaviour as &#145;that of a partisan and consequently subversive of all the loyalty which has characterised the Civil Servants of the Crown, no matter how much the measure is contrary to their individual opinions&#146;  (Hamilton, 436&#150;7). The episode served to remind senior officials of the risk of becoming identified publicly with the causes of their political masters.<br>
<br>After retirement Mowatt became an alderman of the London county council, alongside Welby; held directorships of several public companies and appointments connected with the University of London; and served on several royal commissions and official committees. He lived for some years at Patcham, near Brighton, and followed the South Down hunt. Later he returned to London, where, at 41 Sloane Gardens, Chelsea, he died on 20 November 1919, after suffering for some years from arteriosclerosis, attended by his daughter Hilda Russell, whose husband, William Russell, was the executor of his will.<br>
