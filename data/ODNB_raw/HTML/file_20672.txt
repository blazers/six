<span class="headword">Olaf</span> <span class="st"> [Olaf the Black, Olaf Godredsson]</span>  (1173/4&#150;1237), <span class="occ">king of Man and the Isles</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50615/', "Godred Olafsson")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50613/', "Godred Crovan")</script>], king of Man and the Isles (<i>d</i>. 1187) and Fingola, daughter of Mac Lochlainn and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20745/', "Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, &#145;king of Ireland&#146; (d. 1166)")</script>. He was also known as Olaf the Black and Olaf Godredsson. Godred died on 10 November 1187, leaving three sons, Ragnvald, Olaf, and Ivar. Since Ragnvald had been born out of wedlock, Godred had instructed that his legitimate son Olaf should succeed. But Olaf was only about thirteen years old, and rather than accept a minor as king the Manxmen summoned Ragnvald to the throne in 1188. Olaf was given the island of Lewis for his maintenance, but he became dissatisfied with this poor island and journeyed to Man to seek augmentation of his portion. Ragnvald, however, had Olaf arrested, and then had him imprisoned by William the Lion, king of Scots. There he remained for seven years, until just before his death in 1214 William ordered the release of all his prisoners. Olaf then returned briefly to Man, before setting out on pilgrimage to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. On his return he was reconciled to Ragnvald, who married Olaf to Lauon, his own wife's sister. He granted Olaf possession of Lewis as before, and Olaf resumed residence there.<br>
<br>Olaf cannot have been any more content than previously, and probably looked to Norway for support. At an unspecified date Ragnvald, bishop of the Isles since 1217, summoned a clerical assembly and annulled the marriage of Olaf and Lauon as being within prohibited degrees of relationship. Afterwards Olaf married Christina, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75447/', "Farquhar Mactaggart, earl of Ross")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family")</script>]. King Ragnvald's wife is said to have taken offence, and to have sent a letter under her husband's seal to her son Godred in Skye, instructing him to arrest and kill Olaf. In 1223 Godred collected an army and attacked Lewis, but Olaf escaped and fled to his father-in-law, the earl of Ross. Olaf and the earl swore alliance and set out to take revenge. Learning that Godred and a few followers were on &#145;St Columba's Isle&#146;, apparently near Skye, they surrounded and attacked them. Godred was taken, blinded, and castrated, allegedly without Olaf's consent.<br>
<br>Ragnvald had long been feeling the pressure of Olaf's opposition. In 1218&#150;19 he was mending fences with Henry III of England, travelling to England to do homage and to make amends for excesses of his men in England and Ireland. Then in November 1220, Henry III ordered his justiciar of Ireland to assist Ragnvald in the defence of his kingdom. At this time the chieftains of the Hebrides were revolting against Norwegian rule, and in the spring of 1224 it was rumoured at the Scottish court that Norwegian intervention was imminent. But Olaf remained loyal to Norway and his successes that summer removed the necessity for such intervention. He took hostages from all the chieftains and, arriving at Ronaldsway with thirty-two ships, confronted Ragnvald once more. Upon negotiations it was agreed that Ragnvald should retain Man, the title of king, and a part of the Isles, while Olaf should have the remainder.<br>
<br>Ragnvald now turned for help to Alan, lord of Galloway, the constable of Scotland. In 1225 Ragnvald and Alan mounted an expedition to Skye and Lewis to recover what had been ceded to Olaf. However the Manxmen refused to fight against either Olaf or the people of the Isles, and the expedition returned without achieving anything. Some time afterwards Ragnvald extorted 100 marks from his subjects on pretext of visiting the English king. But with this money he visited Alan of Galloway and contracted a marriage alliance between his daughter and Alan's illegitimate son Thomas. Almost certainly Thomas was intended to succeed as king of Man. The Manxmen revolted against this prospect, and summoned Olaf from the Isles to become king. Thus in 1226 Olaf finally recovered his inheritance and reigned in peace for two years.<br>
<br>Forced to recognize the weakness of Ragnvald's position, Henry III attempted to broker a peace in 1228. Olaf wrote to Henry, giving details of his case against Ragnvald and requesting Henry to use his influence with the king of Scots to put a stop to raids by Alan of Galloway. In April a safe conduct was granted Olaf to go to England to make peace with Ragnvald. But that same year, while Olaf was on expedition to the Isles, Ragnvald, supported by Alan of Galloway and his brother, Thomas, earl of Atholl, devastated the south of Man. Alan returned to Galloway, but he left officials on the island to collect tribute. On his return, Olaf put these officials to flight; but during the winter Ragnvald mounted a further attack. He destroyed Olaf's fleet anchored off St Patrick's Isle, toured the island, and stayed at Ronaldsway for about forty days. During that time he collected support from the south of the island while Olaf mustered his forces in the northern part. On 14 February 1229 the two sides clashed at Tynwald and Ragnvald was killed.<br>
<br>But Alan of Galloway still threatened Man. In the spring of 1230 Olaf arrived at the court of King Haakon IV Haakonsson of Norway to seek help, just as the Norwegians were preparing to launch an expedition to pacify the Hebrides. The fleet was intended to install Ospak Asmundsson&#151;notwithstanding his Scandinavian name a descendant of Somerled of Argyll (<i>d</i>. 1164)&#151;as client king of the Hebrides. Godred Don, a son of King Ragnvald, was one of Ospak's lieutenants. Despite this Olaf agreed to accompany them. They set off, first to Orkney, where they collected reinforcements, and then to Skye, Islay Sound, and Bute. There Ospak was fatally wounded while capturing Rothesay Castle from the Scots. On the approach of Alan's fleet of 200 ships the Norwegians withdrew. Ospak died, and Olaf, taking command of the Norwegian fleet, brought it to Man. There Olaf agreed to partition the kingdom with Godred Don, Olaf retaining Man, while Godred Don received the Hebrides. The following spring the Norwegians departed, having restored their influence in the region. Godred Don was killed while travelling to Lewis and Olaf once more resumed control over the whole kingdom.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1235 Olaf journeyed to the English court to confer with Henry III. The fruit of this negotiation was revival of an arrangement which had already existed between Ragnvald and the English. In return for homage and for the service of guarding at his own cost the Irish Sea coasts of England and Ireland, Olaf was to receive an annual fee from Ireland of 40 marks, 100 crannocks of wheat, and five tuns of wine. But Olaf remained primarily the client of Norway, and when in 1236 he was commanded to attend the Norwegian court, the English king granted him protection for his possessions. It was a prolonged visit, for in April 1237 he had not yet returned.<br>
<br>Olaf died on 21 May 1237 on St Patrick's Isle and was buried in St Mary's Abbey, Rushen. He was succeeded in his kingdom by his three sons in turn, Harald (1237&#150;48), Ragnvald (1249), and Magnus (1254&#150;65).<br>
