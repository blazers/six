<span class="headword">Budden,  Julian Medforth</span>  (1924&#150;2007), <span class="occ">musicologist and radio producer</span>, was born on 9 April 1924 at Brynmor, The Promenade, Hoylake, Cheshire, the only son of Lionel Bailey Budden (1887&#150;1956), lecturer in, and later professor of, architecture at Liverpool University, and his wife, Dora Magdalene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fraser, an Edinburgh-born writer, poet, and (as Maud Budden) author of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Echo</span>'s &#145;Curly Wee&#146; cartoons. He was educated at Stowe School, and then, in 1942, went to Queen's College, Oxford, to read classics. Declaring himself a conscientious objector, he worked in the Friends' Ambulance Unit from 1943 to 1946, serving both in Italy and in Austria. Returning to Queen's, he graduated BA in 1948 and then studied piano (with Thornton Lofthouse), composition (with Patrick Hadley), and bassoon (with Archie Camden) at the Royal College of Music.<br>
<br>In 1951 Budden started at the BBC, where he remained for his entire working life. His first post was as a clerk and script editor (although he found time to take a BMus degree at Trinity College of Music in 1955); he then rose through the BBC ranks to become a producer (1956&#150;70), chief producer of opera (1970&#150;76), and external services music organizer (1976&#150;83). His time at the BBC was a golden age for broadcast opera: little-known works were produced regularly, there were numerous broadcasts from elsewhere in Europe, and Budden was personally responsible for many important revivals, including the resurrection of a number of Verdi's more obscure titles (including the original versions of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">La forza del destino</span>, and <span class="italic">Simon Boccanegra</span>).<br>
<br>Remarkably, though, Budden's work at the BBC continued in tandem with a second occupation as a writer on music. At first this <i>deuxi&egrave;me carri&egrave;re</i> took the form of articles and reviews for <span class="italic">The Listener</span> and other publications, but in the 1970s and early 1980s it flowered into his monumental three-volume study <span class="italic">The Operas of Verdi</span>. It is difficult to overestimate the effect these books had. Their scholarship was impeccable and in many instances entirely original: no source, however obscure, was overlooked, and the assessments of Verdi's literary source material were always fresh, with a formidable cultural background worn lightly. Most impressive of all, though, were the musical judgements. Budden's first volume, covering the operas from <span class="italic">Oberto</span> to <span class="italic">Rigoletto</span>, came out in 1973, at a time when Verdi's early operas were by no means universally respected among musicians. Budden somehow managed to communicate the force of these still rather alien works by looking at them within their own cultural and musical context. His authorial personality was uncommonly welcoming and generous: to his hero Verdi, of course, and to past scholars who had tried to understand him, but also to his readers. His prose was full of wit and relaxed communication, never striving merely to impress.<br>
<br>Budden took early retirement from the BBC in 1983 and then divided his time between a modest flat in London and homes in or near Florence. He became a feature of the Italian operatic scene in his role (by no means self-consciously assumed) as <i>un vero gentleman inglese</i>. His Italian was extraordinary: its elegance of expression and command of the lexicon were praised by the most discriminating judges, and the fact that he continued to deploy these skills within a resolutely English cadence was part of the charm. His books were translated into Italian and inspired a younger generation of Italian Verdians; and he condensed and revised his three-volume <span class="italic">Verdi</span> into a <span class="roman">Master Musicians</span> volume (1985). His last years as a writer were mostly devoted to Puccini: a monograph (more modest in size than the Verdi project, but on the same high level critically) about the life and works appeared in 2002. He was also a member of the editorial board of the Verdi complete edition, served loyally and conscientiously as president of Lucca's Centro di Studi Giacomo Puccini until his death, and was much involved in the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani in Parma. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1987 and appointed OBE in 1991.<br>
<br>This was Julian Budden the scholar and writer. The man was harder to know. Particularly in later years he could sometimes cut a lonely figure at the social jamboree of conferences. But the generosity that so characterized his writing also characterized the man: it was harder to locate, but never entirely submerged. During his Italian years he became close to the Innocenti family in Florence: to Luigi, who was the son of the landlady who housed him during his first Florence sojourn in the 1960s; and to Luigi's son Jimmy, who lived with him for a time in his last house, in Pontassieve. He died in Florence on 28 February 2007 and was buried in a little cemetery outside Doccia, in the undulating Tuscan hills, in the shade of a large cypress tree.<br>
