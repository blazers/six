<span class="headword">Fairfax, Sir  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1604), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the fourth son of Sir Thomas Fairfax (1521&#150;1600) of Denton and Nun Appleton, Yorkshire. Like his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9080/', "Edward Fairfax")</script> he was illegitimate (his mother may have been Dorothy Gale); their inclusion in their father's will was secured by the lobbying of their legitimate eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9091/', "Thomas Fairfax (later first Lord Fairfax of Cameron)")</script>. He matriculated from Clare College, Cambridge, in Easter term 1584 and probably accompanied his brother Thomas to the Netherlands in 1585. By 1599 he had been promoted captain, in time to fight at the battle of Nieuwpoort (1600), where he rallied the English troops at a critical juncture.<br>
<br>Fairfax's company was then posted to Ostend and he was an important figure in the heroic defence of the town, christened &#145;the new Troy&#146; for the length and bitterness of the siege. In early 1602 he and Sir John Ogle volunteered to act as hostages in the Spanish camp during capitulation &#145;negotiations&#146;, which they knew were actually designed to win time. When this was done successfully and talks were broken off, both men were returned unharmed, but could easily have been executed. In the massive Spanish attack which followed Fairfax fought bravely defending the breach and, as he informed the earl of Northumberland, &#145;was badly wounded in the right arm&#146;  (Markham, 329&#150;30).<br>
<br>In common with Vere, Ogle, and other English troops Fairfax was withdrawn from Ostend and spent the rest of 1602 in garrison duties in Holland. He was in England in May 1603, when he was knighted. Twelve months later he won a sharp action near Sluys. Doubtless this helped lead to his recall to Ostend as commander of the English regiment there in June 1604. Fairfax helped conduct a vigorous defence but the city was now doomed. He was killed after 14 September (the date of his last dispatch), probably on the following day. Ostend capitulated on 20 September 1604.<br>
<br>Secondary sources have sometimes been uncertain about the date and manner of Fairfax's death, on occasion suggesting a date as late as 1607. It is worth emphasizing, therefore, that Sir Thomas later stated that his brother, Sir Charles Fairfax, &#145;was slain at the siege of Ostend, and left no estate&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>, 106), while Dudley Carleton fixed the approximate date, writing on 21 September 1604 that Ostend had surrendered on honourable conditions and that Sir Charles Fairfax had been slain there  (ibid., <i>1603&#150;10</i>, 68). A new captain was commissioned &#145;as [his] successor&#146; on 12 October 1604  (Japiske and Rijperman, 136), while in April 1605 the states general voted 900 florins in back pay to Fairfax's &#145;heirs&#146;  (Algemeen Rijksarchief, Den Haag, Collectie Aanwinsten 879, fol. 63<i>v</i>). Fairfax had made his will in May 1602, describing himself as &#145;Charles Fairefax of Brocket in the Countie of York&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/104, fol. 308<i>v</i>). He evidently died a bachelor, dividing his land in Badsworth, Yorkshire, equally between his nephew Henry, his brother Edward, and William Baynton of Hunslet; the rest of his goods were to go to Baynton, who as his executor proved the will on 19 November 1604.<br>
<br>It is quite clear, then, that Fairfax was slain at Ostend, on the eve of the capitulation that would have brought him momentary safety. Given his military record, however, and the death of two of his nephews fighting for the Dutch in 1620, Charles Fairfax was probably unlikely ever to have died in his bed.<br>
