<span class="headword">Peach,  Lawrence Du Garde</span>  (1890&#150;1974), <span class="occ">playwright and author</span>, was born at home at 32 Conduit Road, Nether Hallam, Sheffield, on 14 February 1890, the son of a Unitarian minister, Charles Peach (1862&#150;1943), and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Munns (1863&#150;1940). He was educated at Manchester grammar school (1903&#150;9), where his outstanding abilities as an actor were soon revealed; he went on to graduate at Manchester University in English language and literature (1912). He then obtained a post as Lektor at G&ouml;ttingen University. During the First World War he served in the Manchester regiment and in military intelligence, reaching the rank of captain. His marriage to Emily Marianne Leeming (1889/90&#150;1972), a fellow student, the daughter of Matthew Leeming, a dentist, took place at the Chorlton-cum-Hardy Unitarian Church on 25 September 1915.<br>
<br>After the war Peach resumed his academic career, proceeding to the degree of PhD at Sheffield University (1921); the title of his two-volume thesis was &#145;A study of the dramatic relations of France, Spain, and England in the XVII century&#146;&#151;no doubt inspired partly by the work of his Manchester professor, C. H. Herford. Its object was largely to illustrate by comparative analyses the manner in which dramatic themes and situations already exploited by leading European playwrights were adapted by English authors&#151;Dryden, Wycherley, and others&#151;utilizing different stage conventions and more familiar modes of thought. In 1922 he was appointed to a lectureship at the University College of the South West of England and from 1924 to 1926 acted as central organizer of an appeal in support of efforts to secure full university status for the college. While at Exeter he engaged in freelance journalism, submitting sketches to such journals as <span class="italic">London Opinion</span>, <span class="italic">The Humorist</span>, and, most notably, <span class="italic">Punch</span>. But finding authorship more lucrative than university teaching, he resigned his post at the university college in favour of full-time literary work. In 1925 Chatto and Windus published some of his <span class="italic">Punch</span> contributions under the title of <span class="italic">Angela and I</span>&#151;&#145;Angela&#146; being the female participant in his imaginary dialogues. Two years later John Lane at the Bodley Head brought out an illustrated travel volume, <span class="italic">Unknown Devon</span>. Peach's penchant for satire and &#145;situation comedy&#146; led him to believe that his talents might find a market in the expanding field of playwriting for the amateur stage, as well as the professional theatre. He therefore planned several series of dramas &#145;tailored&#146; to meet the needs of specific groups (such as plays for boys or plays for women) with a bias towards historical themes. His one-act and two-act plays were especially acceptable to youth groups, women's institutes, and educational organizations.<br>
<br>From 1923 Peach was keen to exploit the potentialities of broadcasting, and he is chiefly remembered as one of the pioneers of radio drama. He realized that this new medium demanded from scriptwriters a readiness to experiment with conventions not appropriate to stage presentation. He aimed also to appeal to juvenile listeners, for whom&#151;in the <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> especially&#151;he produced innumerable examples of dramatized history and biography. At a later stage he utilized similar material when putting together ambitious pageants for Sheffield, Manchester, and other cities. He also composed film scripts, but turned down offers of prestigious employment in Hollywood because he was reluctant to submit to the vagaries of producers and sub-editors.<br>
<br>In 1918 Peach's father ended his association with Chorlton in order to become official minister at Great Hucklow, a small Derbyshire village formerly of some importance in the leadmining industry. Soon afterwards Lawrence and his wife also settled in the Peak District. This gave him an opportunity to form a company of thespians capable under his direction of performing plays from the established repertory along with pieces composed by himself. The members of this troupe were mostly local people co-opted on the strength of their natural talent for acting; but at the back of Peach's mind was the conviction that such an amateur group could be trained to achieve a standard of performance higher than was common among many &#145;rude mechanicals&#146;. In their early days these &#145;village players&#146; had to make do with a stage constructed in one of the larger recreational rooms of the local Unitarian holiday home. Later the need for improved amenities induced Peach to purchase a rectangular building deserted by leadminers, and convert it into a small theatre. Right from the start this venture proved successful and led to a novel form of co-operative enterprise in a somewhat backward area. This activity was part of a national &#145;village drama&#146; movement which Peach warmly supported. He chaired the drama committee of the Derbyshire Rural Community Council (1924) and espoused the cause of amateur theatricals in the pages of the <span class="italic">Derbyshire Countryside</span>, a monthly he edited from 1931 to 1948. Eventually the doings of the village players came to be so widely appreciated that a minimum of publicity was all that was needed to ensure capacity audiences, and &#145;house full&#146; notices were frequently in evidence. But the claims of authorship and theatrical involvements did not deter Peach from taking on civic and political responsibilities. In 1929 he stood as Liberal candidate in the general election&#151;though with little hope of victory, since Derby had long been a Labour stronghold. Even so, Peach's intervention helped to increase the Liberal vote from 7083 in the 1924 election to 11,317 in 1929.<br>
<br>During the <i>entre-deux-guerres</i> period Peach's engagements were multifarious: his services as author, lecturer, and adjudicator were in constant demand. He maintained a long-standing connection with the Sheffield Repertory Company, and when the Sheffield Playhouse suspended productions in 1939, he assisted in the company's evacuation to Southport. At first his own players were down-hearted at having to abandon their annual three-weekly &#145;seasons&#146;; but Peach attempted to counter their despondency by writing plays which reflected aspects of life amid wartime frustrations. Those male members of the village players who were of military age were either called up or enrolled in the Home Guard, in which Peach became a major. Admittedly, petrol rationing kept many visitors away from Great Hucklow; but in spite of the temporary closure of their little theatre, the company never suffered total collapse until 1971, when a combination of difficult circumstances put an end to further activities.<br>
<br>From the mid-1950s Peach found time to undertake a substantial non-dramatic assignment for the Loughborough-based educational publishers Wills and Hepworth. He was commissioned to produce a number of short illustrated volumes on historical and archaeological subjects intended for young people of school age. Each item in this highly successful <span class="roman">Ladybird</span> series&#151;over twenty titles in all&#151;ran to fifty pages and dealt with such topics as Stone Age man, Roman Britain, William the Conqueror, Oliver Cromwell, Charles II, Florence Nightingale, Captain Cook, and Charles Dickens. Peach had no qualms about adding to the already considerable stock of what many would regard as merely &#145;potted&#146; knowledge: his efforts were anything but run-of-the-mill regurgitations of standard textbook material. In spite of their concise format, the <span class="roman">Ladybird</span> books are factually irreproachable and presented in a lively prose style calculated to awaken interest in Britain's cultural and political history. Peach's <span class="roman">Ladybird</span> books were as influential as any professional historian's in shaping youthful minds' knowledge of the British past.<br>
<br>Peach's success as a literary man was the outcome of a modest ambition to augment &#145;the public stock of harmless pleasure&#146; while maintaining a keen interest in social affairs. For his services to literature he was made an OBE in 1972; he had been made an honorary DLitt of Sheffield University in 1964. Sadly he left no autobiography, which would have been a significant addition to the annals of English provincial drama. But tantalizing snatches of reminiscence occur in his various prefaces. If his plays are no longer seen on the commercial stage, this is attributable to changes of taste among theatregoers witnessed over the last fifty or sixty years. But Peach's enduring literary monument is unquestionably the unique account of dramatic activities at Great Hucklow which he published in 1952, <span class="italic">Twenty-Five Years of Play Producing, 1927&#150;1952</span>. He died at his home, The Bungalow, in the nearby village of Foolow, Derbyshire, on 31 December 1974, his wife having died two years previously.<br>
