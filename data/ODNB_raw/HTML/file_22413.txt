<span class="headword">Plunket,  Patrick</span>, ninth Baron Dunsany  (1594/5&#150;1668<span class="mult">x</span>70), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son and heir of Christopher Plunket, eighth Baron Dunsany (<i>d</i>. 1603), and his wife Mary 
    (Maud; <i>d</i>. 1610)
  , daughter of Henry Babington of Dethick, Derbyshire. His father died in 1603 while he was still a minor and seven years later, when he was fifteen, his mother was murdered, allegedly by Honora &#145;Ny Caffery&#146; &#145;nurse to one of her children&#146; (after she was burnt, a man owned up to the crime)  (NL Ire., GO 66, p. 21). Patrick later married Jane, daughter of Sir Thomas Heneage of Lincolnshire. In 1618 he received a warrant for his estates in counties Meath and Dublin and, in spite of his Catholicism, enjoyed a prominent position in local affairs. He took his seat in the House of Lords in 1634, becoming involved in a bitter quarrel with Baron Trimleston over precedence, and again in 1640.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the 1641 rising Dunsany, like the other Catholic lords of the pale, condemned it and served as a member of a delegation appointed to confer with the insurgents. In March 1642 he reiterated his loyalty in a letter to Ormond, adding &#145;I am an Englishman born, my mother an Englishwoman, and my wife an Englishwoman&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He later claimed that his house at Castlecore had served as a refuge for English refugees but after the insurgents ambushed him, destroyed much of his estate, plundered his house of furniture and goods worth &pound;4000, and &#145;for his loyalty, had his own daughter and his son's wife, being both great with child, stripped and sent home naked&#146;, he fled to Dublin  (<span class="italic">Journals of the Irish House of Lords</span>, 1.200). He arrived late in 1642 only to be charged with high treason and imprisoned for eighteen months before being bound over to appear for trial in the court of king's bench. It is not clear where he spent the 1640s but he does not appear to have played any role in the confederate war effort, which perhaps explains why in 1653 the Commonwealth gave him permission to hold part of his lands (at Dunsany).<br>
<br>Despite being named in Charles II's &#145;gracious declaration&#146; (30 November 1660) and restored by the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement and Explanation</span> (1665) to his castle and to a third of the estates he had held in 1641, Dunsany encountered considerable problems in recovering possession. In 1668 he wrote to Sir Edward Dering, one of the commissioners of the court of claims, begging for his help and outlining his plight: &#145;the god of heaven and earth knowes my sadd and deplorable condition; my weake and aged bedd-ride condition together with that unspeakable want few knowes but myselfe&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 745, fol. 3). He died some time between 1668 and 1670, outliving his eldest son, Edward, who had married Lady Catherine MacDonnell, fourth daughter of the first earl of Antrim; his title passed to his grandson Christopher.<br>
