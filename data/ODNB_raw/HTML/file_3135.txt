<span class="headword">Boyle,  Richard</span>, first earl of Burlington and second earl of Cork  (1612&#150;1698), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and politician</span>, was born on 20 October 1612 at Youghal, co. Cork, the second child but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3133/', "Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork (1566&#150;1643)")</script>, and his wife, Catherine Fenton (<i>c</i>.1588&#150;1630), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9296/', "Sir Geoffrey Fenton")</script>. His siblings included the natural philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3137/', "Robert Boyle")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3138/', "Roger Boyle, first earl of Orrery")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66365/', "Katherine Jones, Viscountess Ranelagh")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23487/', "Mary Rich, countess of Warwick")</script>. From 16 October 1620, when his father was ennobled, the child was known by his father's subsidiary title of Viscount Dungarvan. Knighted by the Irish lord deputy in 1623, he studied briefly at Oxford in 1629&#150;30 and was then sent on a more extended continental tour. He visited both Saumur and Paris in 1633. The care which had been devoted to his education was also evident in the way his ambitious father negotiated his marriage. On 3 July 1634 he married Elizabeth Clifford (1613&#150;1691), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5649/', "Henry Clifford, fifth earl of Cumberland")</script>. The alliance connected Boyle, the son of an <i>arriviste</i> in protestant Ireland, with an ancient aristocratic house. It brought the prospect of substantial English estates concentrated in Yorkshire, Westmorland, and Cumberland which in time would transform this branch of the Boyles from Irish to English grandees. Dungarvan was further connected with nobles powerful at court, such as the earls of Pembroke and Salisbury. He flourished in this environment, though his extravagance alarmed his father. A measure of his standing was the fact that he was selected to greet the Venetian ambassador in 1638, and the presence of the king and queen at the christening of his heir, Charles, on 17 November 1639. In the latter year he had hastened to the king's side as preparations began for a war against the Scots.<br>
<br>Dungarvan was elected to the Short and Long parliaments in 1640 for the Westmorland borough of Appleby, an area where the Cliffords' influence was strong. However, he sailed back to Ireland at the time of the uprising in autumn 1641. In November 1641 the English parliament commissioned him to command a cavalry troop, and he took part in Irish engagements in the region where the family's property lay, notably the battle of Liscarroll in September 1642. In November he sailed to England, to seek aid for the protestants of the region; he returned to Ireland in July 1643, but in the event defence of the Boyles' Irish interests was deputed to his younger brothers, and Dungarvan returned once again to England. There his adherence to the king's cause led to his being disabled from sitting in parliament on 10 November 1643 and, on 4 November 1644, to his being granted an English peerage as Baron Clifford. Already in 1643 he had succeeded to the Irish earldom of Cork. Although he was not conspicuous as a royalist commander, the importance of the family into which he had married ensured that the parliamentarian authorities monitored his activities. The victorious parliament penalized him. He had paid a fine of &pound;1631 to recover the English estates by the end of May 1650. Not until 1653 did he regain full control of his much more valuable Irish holdings under the terms of the Dublin treaty of 1647. He removed himself discreetly to the continent in the later 1640s, and for a time was with the exiled royalist lord lieutenant, Ormond, at Caen.<br>
<br>Cork returned to Ireland on 28 May 1651, and there attended to the repair of his estate, which his wife had already begun. Once more discretion was his watchword, since members of the occupying army and administration eyed him suspiciously. Nevertheless in private he remained loyal to the liturgy of the proscribed Church of England, and manifested the personal piety which continued for the rest of his life. The enforced attention to his patrimony gave him an intimate knowledge of its human and physical geography, and in no small measure explained its subsequent prosperity. By the 1670s it was probably yielding an annual &pound;30,000, making its owner the richest man in Ireland. From 1655, under the more congenial regime of Henry Cromwell, Cork undertook modest local duties. In 1658 he was appointed a justice of the peace for counties Cork and Waterford. He also welcomed the itinerating lord deputy to his estates in the summer of 1658, and had political discussions with him when in Dublin. In December 1659, as confusion threatened to envelop Ireland and England, Cork positioned himself in London. Along with others from protestant Ireland he schemed to prevent the dispossessed Irish Catholics being treated generously.<br>
<br>Cork was appointed a privy councillor in Dublin in December 1660, and installed in his father's office of lord treasurer on 6 July 1661. The second office, essentially a sinecure, conferred precedence and a daily allowance of &pound;1. It was symptomatic of Cork's limited political influence that he was not consulted about proposed reforms of the Irish revenue despite being nominal head of its administration. The lord treasurership had, nevertheless, given him the disposal of posts in the revenue with which to gratify the politically powerful and his own dependants. His high standing at the English court, together with his wealth, his wife's lineage, and his past services to the Stuarts (especially the queen mother, Henrietta Maria) secured advancement to an English earldom&#151;of Burlington (or Bridlington)&#151;in 1665. Other posts, such as governor (the equivalent of lord lieutenant) of counties Cork and Waterford and military governor of Hawlbowline Fort in Cork harbour (1662), attested to his pre-eminence as a proprietor in the region. For similar reasons he was appointed lord lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire, a position he held briefly in 1667 and from 1679 to 1687, and recorder of York (1685&#150;8). But the manner in which the king asked him to vacate the lord lieutenancy in 1667 in favour of Buckingham, newly reconciled to the court, was a reminder of Burlington's light political weight. Nor could royalist ultras forget how he had compromised with the Cromwellians. As one of the latter remarked, Burlington &#145;was a cautious man that had no mind to venture too far for fear of his great estate, and so seemed to carry fair with all parties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, ed. A. Browning, 1936, 306). In 1667 he had absented himself from the proceedings against the disgraced Clarendon, into whose family his own had recently married. His attitudes towards exclusion and the accession of William III and Mary II were deliberately opaque. In the end, the safety of his valuable Irish holdings overrode other considerations. Oversight of the distinct Irish and English estates necessitated a peripatetic life. In 1667 he acquired the carcass of Sir John Denham's London mansion in Piccadilly, which was completed with a grandeur consonant with the Burlingtons' new dignity; they moved into Burlington House the following year. In 1682 an estate at Chiswick, in Middlesex, was bought, to which in 1684 the family moved permanently. After 1686 advancing years and disturbed conditions prevented further voyages to Ireland. Predeceased by his wife (in 1691) and his eldest son, Charles, Viscount Dungarvan and Lord Clifford (in 1694), he died at Chiswick House on 15 January 1698 and was buried at Londesborough, his Yorkshire seat, on 8 February. He was succeeded by his grandson Charles.<br>
