<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Toulmin,  Joshua</span>  (1740&#150;1815), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and historian</span>, was born in Aldersgate Street, London, on 30 April 1740. He was the son of Caleb Toulmin of Aldersgate Street and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Skinner. In later life he acknowledged his debt to the religious values of his nonconformist upbringing. In 1748 he entered St Paul's School, London, where he acquired a classical education. In 1756, his early inclination towards the dissenting ministry having been confirmed, he spent five years in training for that profession in London, under the tuition of David Jennings and Samuel Morton Savage, with the latter of whom he had a family connection. The classes were conducted under the auspices of the Coward Trust at Savage's residence in Wellclose Square. Like several of his fellow students Toulmin began to depart from Calvinist orthodoxy and encountered &#145;severe remonstrances&#146; from his parents, together with the disapproval of Jennings  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 10.665).<br>
<br>On leaving Hoxton, Toulmin became minister of the Presbyterian congregation of Colyton, Devon, in succession to an Arian, Samuel Slater. He quickly acquired a wide circle of friends, notably in Exeter and Bridport. In 1764 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1824), the youngest daughter of Samuel Smith of Taunton; they had twelve children, of whom their eldest son, Henry (Harry) Toulmin (1766&#150;1823), served as a dissenting minister in Lancashire before emigrating to the United States where he became a judge of the Mississippi territory and a member of the Alabama state assembly.<br>
<br>According to Murch, Toulmin's efforts increased the size of his flock at Colyton. But he disturbed some of its members by his opposition to infant baptism and his adoption of Baptist opinions. Consequently he left Colyton in March 1765 to become minister of Mary Street General Baptist Chapel, Taunton. Here he remained for almost thirty-nine years. The small (and declining) size of the congregation obliged Toulmin to augment his income by taking pupils, while his wife ran a successful bookshop. He also maintained a steady stream of publications; his obituary in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> lists fifty-eight separate items. By his revision and enlargement of Daniel Neal's <span class="italic">History of the Puritans</span> (1793&#150;7), Toulmin earned a reputation as a historian of dissent, while his <span class="italic">History of the Town of Taunton</span> was published with a respectable list of subscribers in 1791; subsequent editions appeared in 1810 and 1822. He published numerous sermons, including collected editions in 1789 and 1810. His sermon &#145;The American War Lamented&#146; (February 1776) deplored the government's use of force against the colonists and placed Toulmin firmly in the radical camp.<br>
<br>Like many General Baptists of the later eighteenth century Toulmin came to adopt anti-Trinitarian opinions. In 1777 he published an admiring biography of Faustus Socinus and subsequently defended Socinian opinions in a pamphlet controversy with Andrew Fuller. He demonstrated his commitment to philanthropy by his promotion of Sunday schools, on which subject he published a sermon in 1789. He was a founder member of the Western Unitarian Society in 1792 and won the respect of Joseph Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey; it was partly through their influence that he was awarded the degree of DD by Harvard College in 1794. He was already (1769) the holder of an MA from Brown University, a Baptist institution.<br>
<br>Toulmin involved himself fully in the political campaigns of the Unitarians. His <span class="italic">Letter to the Bishops</span> (1789) strongly advocated the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, and he obtained more than 200 signatures in Taunton for the Unitarian petition for improved legal rights in 1792. He shared in the opprobrium which fell upon Unitarians during the French Revolution and, like Priestley at Birmingham, he encountered mob violence. According to one report an effigy of Thomas Paine was burnt outside his door, his windows were broken, and his house threatened with fire. His life was thought to be in danger and his wife was obliged to relinquish her bookselling enterprise. Unlike Priestley, however, he was not obliged to leave his chapel, and he remained in Taunton until 1804, although he made no secret of his opposition to the war with revolutionary France, declining to contribute to patriotic subscriptions.<br>
<br>In 1803 Toulmin received an invitation to the New Meeting at Birmingham, which had previously been Priestley's chapel. After some thought, and after other invitations from Gloucester and Great Yarmouth, he accepted and moved to Birmingham in January 1804. His pastoral efforts at the New Meeting seem to have been much appreciated. He continued to preach and write in defence of Unitarianism and to travel extensively in its support. On 15 July 1802 he preached before the Southern Unitarian Society at Portsmouth, and published his sermon under the title <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Scriptures Concerning the Unity of God and the Character of Jesus Christ</span> (1802). It is said to have converted Robert Aspland from Arianism to the belief in &#145;the simple humanity of Christ&#146; that characterized the Unitarian theology of this period  (Aspland, 122&#150;3). While in London for a meeting of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1815 Toulmin aggravated his physical ailments, of which the chief was &#145;an affection of the lungs&#146;  (Kentish, 34). He died in Birmingham on 23 July of that year at the age of seventy-five, having previously indicated his intention to retire, and was buried with full dissenting honours in the burial-ground of the Old and New Meetings, Birmingham, on 1 August. His widow died on 8 July 1824. Toulmin was an important figure in the development of English Unitarianism as a separate denomination, and was a significant, if relatively minor, figure in the history of radicalism. It was characteristic of him that he disapproved of George III's jubilee in 1809 and that he wrote in that year: &#145;Our Dissenters and Whigs are timid. They fear the influence of the clergy&#146;  (Aspland, 237).<br>
