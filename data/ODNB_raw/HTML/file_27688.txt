<span class="headword">Trelawny, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1433<span class="mult">x</span>47), <span class="occ">landowner and soldier</span>, was the son of John Trelawny of Trelawny, Cornwall, and his wife, Maud, daughter of Robert Menwenick. It is not easy to distinguish the son from either the father or another, junior, John Trelawny, who may in fact have been the second John's younger brother. All three were members of parliament for Cornish constituencies, the father representing Bodmin in 1397, and the youngest John sitting for Liskeard in 1421 and for Lostwithiel in 1449. But the second John Trelawny was twice knight of the shire for Cornwall in 1421, and probably also in 1413, and by the end of 1414 had been elected coroner in that county. He also served in France, in 1415 (when he probably fought at Agincourt) in the retinue of Edward, Lord Courtenay, and in 1417 under the duke of Exeter. On 27 September 1419, no longer coroner, but with the style of &#145;king's knight&#146;, he was granted an annuity of &pound;20 per annum by Henry V, later confirmed by Henry VI. He added three oak or laurel leaves to his arms, while the figure of Henry V, which once stood over the west gate of Launceston, is said to have had at its feet the inscription: &#145;He that will do aught for mee, Let hym love well Sir John Tirlawnee&#146;  (Polsue, 3.89). Sir John was still receiving his annuity in 1432, and in the following year made arrangements for the descent of some of his Cornish lands. With his wife Agnes, daughter of Robert Tregoddick, he had perhaps two sons, and also two daughters. He was dead by 1447, while his presumed younger brother and namesake lived until at least 1465.<br>
