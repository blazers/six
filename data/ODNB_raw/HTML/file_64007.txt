<span class="headword">Gittins,  John Stanley</span>  (1910&#150;1996), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 1 March 1910 in Hinckley, Leicestershire, the son of Albert Harold Gittins (1886&#150;1943), a manager of the Co-operative Society, and his wife, Lily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> King (1883&#150;1917). He was educated at Hinckley grammar school (1920&#150;27); University College, Leicester (1927&#150;31), where he graduated BSc in chemistry; Cambridge University (1931&#150;2), where he was awarded a diploma in education; and the University of London Institute of Education (1932&#150;3), where he graduated MA. He married Elizabeth Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1909), schoolteacher and approved school matron, on 2 August 1934. They had two children, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1939) and Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1946).<br>
<br>Gittins served as a science master at Whitgift Middle School, Croydon, between 1932 and 1936, and was then appointed lecturer in education and psychology at the University College of the South West, Exeter, between 1937 and 1938. From 1938 to 1942 he worked as an inspector in the children's department of the Home Office. His duties during the Second World War entailed the inspection of possible sites for new approved schools in rural areas away from cities under threat of bombing and intended for the increasing number of young people identified as delinquent or at risk because of the social and geographical dislocations wrought by the war. One such site, formerly a hostel owned by the Ministry of Works, was at Aycliffe, near Darlington. When Gittins declared it suitable in 1942, he was invited by the Home Office to establish and administer the new school, and he remained its principal until his retirement.<br>
<br>Gittins brought an evolving amalgam of themes to his new post: a natural scientific bent acquired as an undergraduate chemist; an admiration for psychology acquired as a graduate student in education; a stress on the superiority of experience and &#145;common sense&#146; over academic theory; and a personal commitment to teaching. Professing&#151;as in the <span class="italic">Northern Echo</span> of 1 June 1954&#151;that very little was known about the causes or cures of delinquency, he nevertheless maintained a cautious optimism about the possibility of changing the young by exposing them to improving influences, including community service, hiking, art, drama, &#145;good films&#146;, and classical music. He once told Ron Clarke, sometime head of the Home Office research unit, that he was wasting his time on &#145;all that &#147;kiddlepumph&#148;&#146; about absconding from approved schools, the subject of Clarke's PhD dissertation, and that he would do better to examine the successful methods employed at Aycliffe  (private information). Delinquency, Gittins said, is &#145;a malaise of society&#146;, a form of social incompetence compounded by unsatisfactory, unstimulating, and unstable homes  (<span class="italic">Evening Dispatch</span>, 31 Jan 1947). Aycliffe itself combined practical activity with therapy and education broadly conceived in &#145;a kind of crucible in which one is carrying out an experiment using ingredients in a concentrated form&#146;.<br>
<br>In common with many other post-war penologists, Gittins became persuaded that successful rehabilitation rested on early intervention and a proper classification of the young into categories for allocation to different regimes. Aycliffe was the first classifying school approved by the Home Office, the biggest and the best in the country according to the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, designed to observe, assess, and place children in local training schools in the north-east. Gittins was perhaps most celebrated for the classifying methods he devised at Aycliffe and subsequently publicized in a Home Office report of 1952. Those methods were represented as pragmatic and simple, intended for purposes of action, and based on the limited knowledge of the time, rather than as scientific or precise measures of complex phenomena. Boys were transferred to a training school after a comprehensive report had been compiled on tests for educational attainment and intelligence, observations of health, and descriptions of family background and present conduct.<br>
<br>As Aycliffe's founder, long-standing principal, and trainer of new staff, Gittins, who was described by Professor Roger Hood as a &#145;tall and imposing man&#146; and by others as &#145;charismatic&#146;  (private information), came to exert a considerable authority over thinking about penal policy. He was appointed OBE in 1962 and retired from Aycliffe in 1970. He died of heart failure at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 27 October 1996, and was cremated in Newcastle the following month. He was survived by his wife, daughter, and son.<br>
