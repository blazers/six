<span class="headword">Mannin,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1779), <span class="occ">painter and decorative artist</span>, is said to have been a Frenchman but his name is also found in Italy, in Venice and in Genoa. He was engaged on a salary in 1756 by the Dublin Society Schools to teach the art of design, and remained there until shortly before his death. He had earlier been teaching in the schools on the basis of payment for each student he taught, and he had a considerable private practice. Strickland recorded that he was in Dublin during the 1740s  (Strickland, 2.100). No painting by him is known, although he exhibited flower pieces, designs for interior decoration, and landscapes at the Society of Artists in Ireland between 1765 and 1777. In 1768 he lived in Dublin at King's Street, Stephen's Green, and following his marriage on 18 October 1769 to Mary Maguire in St Andrew's Church, Dublin, he lived at Lazar's Hill, until 1775 when he moved to King Street. The president's chair at the Royal Dublin Society was designed by Mannin in 1767 and carved by Richard Cranfield, and is in a very Italianate manner. He probably taught landscape painting. His pupils included George Barret, Thomas Roberts, and J. J. Barralet, who took over his post in the Dublin Society Schools when ill health forced him to retire shortly before his death in Dublin in 1779.<br>
