<span class="headword">Asquith <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Charteris]</span>, Lady  Cynthia Mary Evelyn</span>  (1887&#150;1960), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 27 September 1887 at her family's estate, Clouds, near East Knoyle, Wiltshire. She was the third of seven children of Hugo Charteris (1857&#150;1937), styled Lord Elcho until his succession as ninth earl of Wemyss, and his wife, Mary Constance Wyndham (1862&#150;1937) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40735/', "Charteris, Mary Constance")</script>]. Most of her childhood was spent at another family estate, Stanway House, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where she was educated privately; one of her governesses, Charlotte Jourdain, inspired in her a deep respect for learning, and she sought mastery in subjects such as Greek, not normally part of the education of a girl of her class. Her parents were leading lights in the aristocratic circle called the Souls, a group notable both for its members' political power and for their romantic entanglements; she later suspected that Arthur Balfour, one of the Souls, was her father.<br>
<br>Cynthia Charteris's parents sent her, in 1903&#150;4, for &#145;finishing&#146; to Dresden, where she met Herbert Asquith (1881&#150;1947), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30483/', "Herbert Henry Asquith")</script>, the liberal politician. The two became secretly engaged in 1907, and married on 28 July 1910. Her family did not favour the match: Asquith, a barrister, had far more limited means than those to which his young wife had been accustomed. They leased a home near Regent's Park in London until the First World War broke out in 1914 and her husband entered the Royal Field Artillery. In that year her grandfather died, and she inherited the title Lady Cynthia, a title that, however, was accompanied by neither money nor property. She began a long period of moving from one temporary home to another, which she called &#145;cuckooing&#146;. By this time she had two sons, John (<i>b</i>. 1911) and Michael (<i>b</i>. 1914); a third son, Simon, was born in 1919.<br>
<br>Lady Cynthia Asquith's wartime diaries (published in 1968) are the best of all the writing she eventually produced. They detail her cuckooing existence as well as her growing difficulties with her son John, who was slipping into the condition later described as autism. More importantly, the diaries provide a dynamic portrait of aristocratic life during the war: side by side with trivia about hair-styles and dinner parties are simple and moving entries about the deaths of many of the young men with whom she had grown up, including two of her brothers. The diaries are vivid, insightful, and often clever as well, expressive of her complex personality and sensibility.<br>
<br>A friend and confidant during these years was D. H. Lawrence, who depicted Asquith in a number of his works (most notably in the short story &#145;The Blind Man&#146;); some feel she is the basis also for his Lady Chatterley. Her husband returned from the front suffering from shell-shock, which impaired his ability to earn a living, and in 1918 she took a job as secretary to the playwright J. M. Barrie, who became a dominant presence in her life until his death in 1937; for Barrie, she played alternately the roles of friend, nurse, mother, and lover, and at his death he left her some &pound;30,000, which at last gave her financial security.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Lady Cynthia Asquith had begun producing a series of anthologies for children and adults, persuading her friends to contribute to them (Lawrence's &#145;The Rocking-Horse Winner&#146; was written for one of her collections); they enjoyed some popularity, ten different titles being produced between 1923 and 1929. She also wrote novels&#151;<span class="italic">The Spring House</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">One Sparkling Wave</span> (1943)&#151;which are chiefly of interest for their autobiographical content.<br>
<br>After Barrie's death Lady Cynthia and her husband moved to Sullington, Sussex, close to the home of her friend the novelist Viola Meynell; and in 1946 they moved to Bath. After her husband's death in August 1947 she moved to London. She invested money in the publishing company being started by Barrie's nephew, James Barrie, and he persuaded her to write her memoirs for the firm. The first, <span class="italic">Haply I May Remember</span>, was published in 1950, and <span class="italic">Remember and Be Glad</span> in 1952; both are valuable portraits of the era in which she grew up. During this time she also wrote a memoir, <span class="italic">Portrait of Barrie</span> (1954). She also wrote a play, <span class="italic">No Heaven for Me</span> (1943; produced in 1946), about Tolstoy's wife, and later wrote a full-scale biography of her, <span class="italic">Married to Tolstoy</span> (1961). But before that book was in print, she contracted meningitis and died in the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 31 March 1960.<br>
<br>Those who knew her admired Lady Cynthia for her stunning beauty, her qualities of discretion and loyalty, and her unique blend of intelligence and playfulness; her lofty social background made her fascinating to many as well, and portraits of her figure in the works not only of Lawrence but of Enid Bagnold, Angela Thirkell, and L. P. Hartley. Of the many titles that came out under her name most are relatively slight, as most were produced out of the need to help support her family, but her <span class="italic">Diaries</span> and her memoirs are remarkable works which provide insight into both her and the class into which she was born.<br>
