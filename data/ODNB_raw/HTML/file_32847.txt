<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dodd,  Francis Edgar</span>  (1874&#150;1949), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, was born in Upper Park Street, Holyhead, Anglesey, on 29 November 1874, the third son of the Revd Benjamin Dodd, a Wesleyan Methodist minister who had once been a blacksmith, and his wife, Jane Frances, daughter of Jonathan Shaw, cotton broker, of Liverpool. After his family had moved to Glasgow, Dodd attended Garnett Hill School. There in 1889 he began to learn painting. There he also met his future brother-in-law and lifelong friend the painter and etcher Muirhead Bone. While he worked as a china decorator with Messrs MacDougal he began to study at the Glasgow School of Art, winning the Haldane travelling scholarship of &pound;100 per annum, which he eked out for eighteen months, in 1893. He went to Aman-Jean's academy in Paris but on the advice of J. A. M. Whistler he spent some time in Venice, studying Tintoretto, and visited Florence, Milan, and Antwerp.<br>
<br>In 1895 Dodd settled with his family at Manchester. His circle of acquaintance included the newspaper editor C. P. Scott and the literary scholar Oliver Elton, whose portraits he etched in 1916. He was closely associated with the artist Susan Isabel Dacre (1844&#150;1933), who posed for his painting <span class="italic">Signora Lotto</span> (1906), now in Manchester City Galleries. She was also the model for some of his first drypoints as in <span class="italic">Looking at a Picture</span> (1907). He had absorbed something of the Glasgow school's impressionism and something of the style of the painter Alfred Stevens. At Manchester he began to explore the possibilities of painting suburban scenes. Works in various media were exhibited by him in the Manchester Academy, and in 1898 Bernhard Sickert invited him to exhibit with the New English Art Club. He became an active member of both institutions; the latter owed much to his skilful handling of its finances.<br>
<br>In 1901 Dodd went on the first of three visits to Spain, and in 1904 he settled in London. His friends at this period included Charles March Gere, Henry Lamb, and Henry Rushbury; all four later became Royal Academicians. Dodd began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1923, and was elected an associate in 1927 and Royal Academician in 1935. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours and of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, and a trustee of the Tate Gallery (1929&#150;35). As official artist to the Ministry of Information during the First World War, Dodd made portraits of British naval and military commanders, and was afterwards attached to the Admiralty to carry out drawings of submarines. These are now in the Imperial War Museum. Portraits by him are in the National Portrait Gallery, London, at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
<br>It was in his portraits that Dodd excelled as an etcher, above all in those of his brother artists. Direct, relaxed, and highly competent, the portraits reveal him as a master of his craft. Dodd got off to a flying start producing thirty-six plates in 1907 and 1908, among them the forceful image of his fellow etcher, <span class="italic">Bone at the Press</span>. In 1909 Dodd executed the drypoint which Bone considered &#145;a masterpiece&#146;, of the young sculptor Jacob Epstein. In 1915 he made twenty-three plates, the most he ever produced in a year, including David Muirhead seated at his easel, and the Lancastrian architect Charles Holden. Charles Cundall, in his studio (1926), was another of his best subjects. He did only eighteen plates after 1929, but he produced a total of 210. He gave a complete collection of his prints to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in 1948.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1911 Dodd married Mary Arabella (1871/2&#150;1948), daughter of John Brouncker Ingle, a solicitor, of London. On 27 January 1949 he married, as his second wife, Ellen (Nell) Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), daughter of Charles Tanner, builder's assistant, of London. She had been his model for many years. There were no children by either marriage. Dodd gassed himself at his home at 51 Blackheath Park, Blackheath, Greenwich, and died on 7 March 1949. Examples of Dodd's work are in the Tate collection, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, Manchester City Galleries, and the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow.<br>
