<span class="headword">Davies,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1581), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's and biblical translator</span>, was born at Plas y Person, Gyffin, Caernarvonshire, the son of Dafydd ap Gronw, curate of Gyffin in the diocese of Bangor, and his &#145;wife&#146;, Sioned, daughter of Dafydd ap Richard; such clerical marriages were common in Wales before the Reformation. Both parents were of gentle stock; Davies's father was descended from the line of Ithel Felyn and his mother from Ednowain Bendew. He was reputedly born in either 1501 or 1509, although a date of about 1505 would best fit other facts known about him. No certainty exists concerning his early education, but his kinsman, a leading poet, Gruffudd ab Ieuan ap Llywelyn Fychan (<i>c</i>.1485&#150;1553), seems to have given him the run of his library. He entered New Inn Hall, Oxford, about 1522 or 1523, where he graduated MA in 1530 and BTh in 1536. He was created DTh at London on 30 October 1566 by virtue of a commission from the University of Oxford.<br>
<br>It was at Oxford in his youth that Davies appears to have been converted to his reforming beliefs. His movements between 1536 and 1549 are obscure; but he may have remained at the university and may also have been the canon called Richard Davies preferred at St Asaph in 1540. He was certainly presented by Edward VI to the living of Maidsmorton, Buckinghamshire, in 1549 and to neighbouring Burnham, a traditional stronghold of Lollardy, in 1550. Such royal patronage strongly suggests protestant sympathies on his part. This is further attested by his taking advantage of the act of parliament of 1549 to marry Dorothy, the daughter of Thomas Woodforde, gentleman, of Brightwell, Burnham. Following the accession of Queen Mary, Davies was summoned to appear before the privy council on 17 September 1553&#151;presumably on account of his heretical opinions. By December 1553 he had been replaced as vicar of Burnham. Richard Davies may also be the married cleric of that name ejected from Northales, Suffolk, in 1555. In the same year, he and his wife and family withdrew into exile in Europe. His name is found in the city records of Frankfurt am Main in 1555 and 1557, but not in those of Geneva, where Sir John Wynn believed that Davies had taken refuge, a claim that has been followed by many later historians. While he was in Frankfurt Davies sided with the more conservative wing of the exiles who stood by the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. His contacts with exiles like Richard Cox and Edmund Grindal, both to be influential leaders of the Elizabethan church, may well have been of considerable influence in shaping his later career.<br>
<br>Davies returned from Europe in 1559 following Elizabeth I's accession in the previous November. In July 1559 he was appointed to lead the panel of royal visitors entrusted with enforcing the Elizabethan church settlement in the four dioceses of Wales and those of Worcester and Hereford. Simultaneously, contemporary visitors in the county of Buckingham restored his living of Burnham to him. In the course of his own visitation, begun at Llandaff in August 1559, Davies was elected as bishop of St Asaph on 4 December 1559. He was consecrated at Lambeth on 21 January 1560 by Archbishop Parker and was allowed to retain <i>in commendam</i> his two Buckinghamshire livings, the rectory of Llansanffraid-ym-Mechain, Montgomeryshire, and a canonry at St Asaph. His tenure at St Asaph was short, but not without significance. In response to an enquiry from Archbishop Parker of November 1560, he dispatched a valuable report on the state of his clergy: how many were resident, in orders, married, learned, and able to preach. He also established friendly relations with a circle of learned humanists in his diocese, of whom the most notable were William Salesbury, Humphrey Llwyd, and Gruffudd Hiraethog.<br>
<br>On 21 May 1561 Davies was moved to St David's to succeed Thomas Young, who had been translated to York as archbishop. For the next twenty years he would be the leading figure in the Welsh church. His new diocese was much the largest and most lucrative bishopric in Wales. It sprawled over about three-quarters of south Wales, was mountainous and thinly populated (about 80,000&#150;90,000 inhabitants in 1563), had poor communications, and was difficult to administer. It had been the scene of fierce conflicts, religious and personal; most of its livings were poorly remunerated; there was a shortage of clergy, particularly of educated men who could preach; and a majority of its population was Welsh-speaking and conservative by religious inclination, but no provision had yet been made in the way of Welsh bibles or prayer books. Davies's sole surviving register, dating from 1561 to 1565, although giving evidence of his diligence in seeking, ordaining, and installing suitable clergy, also reveals the very slow improvement being achieved.<br>
<br>More important was the lead Davies gave in seeking a Welsh translation of the scriptures, his countrymen's most pressing religious need. It was he, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24546/', "William Salesbury")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16867/', "Humphrey Llwyd")</script> who were probably responsible for securing the private act of parliament of 1563, which authorized the translation into Welsh of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and their use within all parishes where the language normally spoken by the population was Welsh. Davies also appears to have steered the passage of the act through the House of Lords. To expedite work on the translation he invited Salesbury to the episcopal palace at Abergwili. Salesbury undertook the bulk of the work, being responsible for translating the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and most of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Davies's share consisted of translating <span class="roman">1 Timothy</span>, <span class="roman">Hebrews</span>, <span class="roman">James</span>, and 1 and 2 <span class="roman">Peter</span>, while the precentor of St David's, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14046/', "Thomas Huet")</script>, translated the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Both the prayer book and the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> were published in 1567, the prayer book appearing first.<br>
<br>Davies was an accomplished author, writing Welsh with greater ease and fluency than his more celebrated collaborator, Salesbury. He also prefaced the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> with a highly influential letter addressed to the Welsh nation (&#145;Epistol at y Cembru&#146;). This rewrote Welsh church history from a protestant standpoint from the time of the ancient Britons onwards. It maintained that the island of Britain had first been converted to Christianity by Joseph of Arimathea in apostolic times. It emphasized two cardinal points in order to rebut central criticisms usually levied against the Reformation in Wales: that it was newfangled heresy; and that it was the faith of Saxons. Conversely, Davies contended that it was the religion of the earliest forefathers of the Welsh, and that superstitious Roman beliefs and practices had been introduced into Wales at the point of the sword by the papal emissary, Augustine of Canterbury, and his Anglo-Saxon minions. This revamping of traditional history was to be extremely influential for centuries to come. Davies also participated in the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> of 1568 known as the <span class="roman">Bishops' Bible</span>. At Parker's invitation he translated the books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> from <span class="roman">Joshua</span> to <span class="roman">2 Samuel</span>. He and Salesbury had originally intended to translate the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> into Welsh, and they continued with their task after 1567, but never succeeded in completing it. According to Sir John Wynn, their failure to do so was caused by a quarrel between them over a single word, but it may very well have been due to a difference over the wider issue of how best to present the Welsh language in print.<br>
<br>Davies was, without doubt, one of the most active and vocal champions of the Reformation in Wales. His &#145;Letter to the Welsh nation&#146;, his comprehensive diocesan report (1570), and the <span class="italic">Funeral Sermon</span> (1577) on the earl of Essex are some of the most forthright statements in favour of protestant reform issued by any Welshman during the period. He condemned the &#145;great number&#146; in his diocese who were &#145;slow and cold in the true service of God, some careless for any religion and some that wish the Romish religion&#146;, while others indulged in &#145;pilgrimages to wells and watchings in chapels and desert places&#146; and were &#145;bearers of superstition and idolatry&#146;  (Thomas, 33, 43). He was unsparing in his criticism of the clergy's inadequacies and their failure to preach regularly, and urged the privy council to take appropriate remedial steps. He further drew the council's attention to the desperate poverty of many livings and how this inevitably led to pluralism, non-residence, and failure to hold services regularly. He criticized the tendency among clergy to &#145;serve three or four, yea sometimes five livings, but never one aright&#146;, and to &#145;come hither galloping from another parish&#146;  (ibid., 43), so that the parishioners were little or nothing the better for it.<br>
<br>Himself a learned man, and praised by contemporaries not only for his knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew but also for his familiarity with French and German, Davies was anxious to maintain his own contacts with scholarly circles. He was in correspondence with Matthew Parker and Sir William Cecil on topics of mutual interest, and kept up his links with the humanist circle around Edmund Grindal and the poet Spenser. In the latter's <span class="italic">Shepherd's Calendar</span> Davies is very probably the original on whom one of the shepherds, Diggon Davie, is based. He maintained at Abergwili a lively and bountiful household, the subject of much praise by some of his contemporaries. Regular preaching of the gospel was heard there, and he hosted a wide range of scholars, clerics, and men of letters. Davies also recognized the pressing need to raise the level of education among the clergy. To this end he was associated with his friend Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, whom he praised so warmly in the <span class="italic">Funeral Sermon</span> to him as an outstanding embodiment of the virtues of protestant aristocratic humanism. In 1576 they joined together to take a leading role in founding Queen Elizabeth Grammar School at Carmarthen, which was to make an invaluable contribution to the education of the clergy in the diocese for centuries to come. On the other hand, Davies was himself censured for bestowing valuable benefices on friends and relatives. He placed Philip Sidney, son of his friend Sir Henry Sidney, as a prebendary when only ten years of age. His own sons, Peregrine and Gerson, also benefited from their father's solicitude. The former became archdeacon of Cardigan at the age of ten, and the latter received preferment worth &pound;110 a year when he was seventeen. Davies's successor at St David's, Marmaduke Middleton, accused him of alienating the bishop's rights of advowson over all livings worth more than &pound;10 per annum, although the chapter records show him to have granted only 38 out of about 150 within his gift.<br>
<br>Davies blamed the laity for many of the deficiencies apparent in the contemporary church and among its clergy. He was appalled by the &#145;insatiable covetousness and ambition&#146; that reigned on all sides: the &#145;whole world seeketh to be made blessed by worldly goods and possessions&#146;  (Davies, ciii). He accused the office-holding gentry of being responsible for conniving at pluralism and simony and highlighted their reluctance to impose discipline on clerics and laymen: &#145;they continue the kingdom of Antichrist, defend papistry, superstition and idolatry, pilgrimages to wells and blind chapels&#146;, &#145;procure the wardens of churches to perjury, to conceal images, rood lofts and altars&#146;  (Davies, ciii&#150;civ). He unreservedly condemned the absence of scruple on the part of what he described as the &#145;insatiable cormorants&#146; with which his diocese abounded. The most damaging loss inflicted by these predators was occasioned by George Cary, groom of the queen's chamber, who procured a commission of concealment to inquire into the state of the church of Llanddewibrefi, which he claimed to be a collegiate church being unlawfully withheld from the crown. There ensued a prolonged legal battle which did not end until after Davies's death, with Cary victorious. The victor was then permitted by the queen to lease the church and its prebends for &pound;40 a year, which he promptly sublet for &pound;140 a year. The outcome was that the annual revenues of St David's diocese were reduced from &pound;457 to &pound;263.<br>
<br>Davies's talents as an administrator were freely employed on secular as well as religious affairs. He attended the House of Lords and the upper house of convocation regularly, though without playing an outstanding role in either. He served as a justice of the peace and as a member of the council in the marches, which commissioned him to act on its behalf to execute a variety of administrative tasks. The most taxing of the duties assigned to him was to act as the privy council's representative in dealing with piracy along the south Wales coast in 1565, 1572, and 1578. Piracy was increasingly prevalent in south-western Wales and was made all the worse by the complicity of the local population. Coping with it was a thankless and burdensome task, which led to friction between the bishop and two prominent local landowners, Sir John Perrott and Richard Vaughan. Another neighbour with whom Davies quarrelled was a fellow member of the council in the marches, Fabian Phillips, who took him to task for his laxity over moral delinquency in the diocese and for blatantly siding with his son-in-law, William Penry, in a dispute between the latter and Phillips's kinsmen.<br>
<br>Davies was the subject of a number of tributes by contemporaries. He was, as might be expected, lavishly applauded by the Welsh poets Wiliam Ll&#375;n, Wiliam Cynwal, Hywel ap Syr Mathew, and Robert Middleton, all of whom had been recipients of his generosity. Two leading antiquaries also testified enthusiastically to his merits. Sir John Wynn described him as a &#145;rare scholar and especially an Hebrician&#146;, and spoke of how his heart warmed &#145;in recording the memory of so worthy a man&#146;  (Wynn, 64&#150;5). George Owen, for his part, declared that Davies was a:<blockquote>man no less in his time much reverenced for his rare virtues and excellency in learning &hellip; than honoured for his public hospitality and liberality &hellip; bearing himself as he was inwardly affected of the good, and never detracted but of the bad. (Owen, 1.240)</blockquote>Davies made his will on 13 September 1581, in which he provided for his widow, three sons, and two daughters. He died on 7 November 1581 at the bishop's palace in Abergwili, Carmarthenshire, and was buried in the churchyard at Abergwili, as requested in his will. His original gravestone has disappeared, but he is commemorated as one of the translators of the Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the national memorial erected at St Asaph in 1888.<br>
