<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Laing,  Alexander Gordon</span>  (1794&#150;1826), <span class="occ">army officer and explorer in Africa</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 27 December 1794, the eldest son of William Laing, a schoolmaster and the founder of a classical academy in Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of William Gordon of Glasgow Academy. With teaching on both sides of his family, Laing seemed destined for a career of scholarship. He entered Edinburgh University at the age of thirteen, and, on graduating at seventeen, became a schoolmaster. But, having joined one of the local volunteer corps then being formed, he opted for a military life, was commissioned in 1810 ensign in the Prince of Wales's Edinburgh volunteers, and in 1811 went to Barbados, where his uncle was deputy quartermaster-general. In 1813 he was appointed ensign in the York light infantry, a corps which served in the West Indies, and in 1815 was promoted lieutenant. After the corps was disbanded at the peace, Laing exchanged into the 2nd West India regiment in Jamaica. He fell ill with a liver complaint, was sent to Honduras, and then returned home, where he was put on half pay in 1818. In 1820 he was brought back into the 2nd West India regiment and posted to Sierra Leone, where in 1822 he transferred, as captain, to the Royal African Colonial Corps.<br>
<br>Laing's posting to Africa awakened a long-desired dream of exploring the interior and finding the still uncharted Niger. Soon after his arrival he was sent by the governor, Sir Charles MacCarthy, on two successive missions to Forecariah in the coastal country (later Guinea) north of Sierra Leone, to mediate in a war between two rulers which was disrupting trade. While there, he found that one of them was receiving help from an army sent by the ruler of Solima Yalunka, an inland kingdom over a hundred miles from the coast, with its capital at Falaba, still unvisited from the colony. On his return, suspecting that it might open his way to the Niger, he offered to MacCarthy to visit Falaba to open up trade.<br>
<br>In 1822 Laing set out with a small escort up the Rokel River, through the mountainous Koranko country to Falaba, where he was well received by the ruler. He went on and found the source of the Rokel, but though he viewed the upland where the Niger rises he was not allowed to go on and had to return disappointed. He was, however, able to establish, by taking its height, that the Niger could not, as some still supposed, possibly flow into the Nile. His <span class="italic">Travels</span>, published in 1825, give a lively account of his adventures, including not only observations on the customs of the peoples he encountered, illustrated with his own rather amateurish drawings and a good map, but also an oral history of Solima Yalunka back to the seventeenth century, useful to later historians. Laing was transferred to the Gold Coast in 1823 and edited the first newspaper to be published there. Then, stationed on the frontier, he participated in some skirmishes with the Asante army before the disastrous battle of Nsamanko, in which MacCarthy and almost all his men were killed. Now in poor health, he was sent home to report the news of the defeat to the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst, with whom, to the annoyance of his senior officers, he ingratiated himself. In 1824 he was sent, with the local rank of major, on an official mission to seek the elusive Niger.<br>
<br>The Niger quest had now become a race. Hugh Clapperton, having returned from the expedition that he, Dixon Denham, and Walter Oudney had made southwards across the Sahara from Tripoli, was now convinced that the Niger flowed into the Atlantic and set out in 1825 for the Atlantic coast. Laing, instructed to go via Tripoli, proposed to travel south-eastwards across the Sahara to Ghadames, then to Timbuktu, still a name of glamour and mystery to Europeans, and thence to follow the Niger to its mouth. He arrived in Tripoli in May 1825, and was warmly welcomed by the British consul-general Hanmer Warrington, whose friendly relations with the ruling Turkish pasha, Yusuf Karamanl&#305;, had made it possible for Denham's mission to travel safely across the desert. Laing, ignorant of the difficulties of Saharan travel, had budgeted for a sum far below that which Yusuf Karamanl&#305; required, so he was delayed in Tripoli while Warrington wrote to London asking for more. Meanwhile Laing fell in love with Warrington's daughter Emma (<i>d</i>. 1829), and, despite her father's dismay at this &#145;Wild, Enthusiastic and Romantic Attachment&#146;  (TNA: PRO, FO 76/19, 1725), they were married on 14 July 1825, four days before his departure for Timbuktu (her father prudently insisting that the marriage remain unconsummated).<br>
<br>Bathurst refused the requested subvention&#151;and may thus be held indirectly responsible for Laing's eventual death. Denham's mission had been subsidized by a grant that guaranteed the protection of the two powerful rulers whose territories they crossed, Yusuf Karamanl&#305; and Sultan Bello of Sokoto. Laing set out, on 18 July, without official protection, across a vast desert notoriously infested by Tuareg marauders. Sheikh Babani, a merchant long resident in Timbuktu, accompanied him as a guide. His party included two west African boat builders, to build a boat when they reached the Niger, Jacob Nahun, a Jewish interpreter, and his servant, Jack le Bore. Born in the Caribbean (San Domingo), le Bore had served all over Europe as a trumpeter in Napoleon's armies, then, at the peace, volunteered for the British army, and while stationed in Sierra Leone had accompanied Laing to Falaba.<br>
<br>Following a circuitous route across the desert, the party reached Ghadames, where they stayed six weeks (Laing sketched the Roman ruins), then moved westwards, making the detour to suit Babani's interests, to Ensala, where they were joined by a large trading caravan. Delayed by rumours of warfare between Tuareg and Arab clans, they eventually left on 9 January 1826. Sixteen days later they were attacked by Tuareg. Laing was fearfully wounded, with sabre cuts on his head, body, arms, and legs. Astonishingly he survived, tended by a kindly sheikh, Sidi Muhammad, who lived nearby. He set out again on 1 July, with one black servant, Bungola, his other companions, including Babani and the invaluable le Bore, being now dead.<br>
<br>On 13 August Laing reached Timbuktu, where he stayed for several weeks, researching into old manuscripts. But the city was now under the control of Ahmadu, the Fula ruler of Masina, who refused to let him go further. Nevertheless he again set out and (the full details are uncertain) was attacked and killed by a party who came out after him from Timbuktu on 24 September 1826. Bungola survived, and returned two years later to Tripoli with the news.<br>
<br>Overwrought at the death of his son-in-law, Warrington wildly accused the pasha of having conspired with the French consul, Baron Rousseau, to have Laing killed and his journals, which had not surfaced, spirited away to France. His accusations were taken seriously in London, gunboats were sent to Tripoli, and the British and French governments were involved in several years of acrimonious diplomatic correspondence. The story was even believed by some historians, including the author of Laing's entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Laing himself was quietly forgotten. Not until 1931 did the Royal African Society have a memorial plaque put on the house where he stayed in Timbuktu. His surviving letters and papers, edited by E. W. Bovill, were finally published by the Hakluyt Society in 1964.<br>
