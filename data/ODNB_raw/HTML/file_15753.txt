<span class="headword">Knollys <span class="st"> [Knolles]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1546), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was probably from Halifax, Yorkshire. In 1495 he was ordained acolyte and admitted to Magdalen College as a bachelor fellow; by 1498/9 he had taken up a fellowship. In 1500/01 he was appointed as an Ingledew chaplain-fellow at Magdalen, taking his MA and becoming second bursar at the college the next year. On 30 June 1502 he was instituted as vicar of Wakefield, a living he retained until his death. Knollys was admitted BTh on 19 April 1515, and was awarded his DTh in June 1518. In January 1528, following Wolsey's legatine visitation which superseded the authority of the bishop of Winchester, Laurence Stubbes, the president of Magdalen, resigned. Thomas Knollys was nominated to the vacancy, probably by Wolsey. In the contest which followed on 6 February 1528 he was chosen in preference to John Higdon, a former president. Knollys was one of those who delivered the university's determination against the validity of the king's divorce in 1531.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1535 the members of the college unanimously pledged their allegiance to the king as head of the established church. But it is clear that Knollys had reservations about the new dispensation, and he spent a large sum on adorning the high altar of the chapel. His staunchly traditional outlook on religious rites and ceremonies sat uncomfortably with government policy now evolving under the direction of Thomas Cromwell. In 1535 Cromwell tried to remove Knollys from the presidency, but his nominee, Thomas Marshall, was rejected by the Magdalen fellows. The following year, however, a more acceptable candidate was found in Owen Oglethorpe, whose candidature the fellows agreed to support in the event of the death of the incumbent president. Pressure, meanwhile, was put on Knollys; on 3 February 1536 he set his signature to a letter of resignation. The fellows proceeded to the installation of Oglethorpe, and Knollys retired to Yorkshire. On 7 May 1536 he was instituted as vicar of South Kirkby; he held the living until his death on 9 May 1546 in Wakefield. He was buried at Wakefield church.<br>
