<span class="headword">Maynwaring <span class="st"> [Manwaring]</span>,  Roger</span>  (1589/90?&#150;1653), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was born at Stretton, Shropshire, into a Cheshire gentry family, according to David Lloyd on 9 November and, if the age at death recorded in his epitaph is accurate, in 1589 or 1590. He attended the King's School, Worcester, before going early in 1604 to Oxford, where he became a bible clerk at All Souls College. He graduated BA in February 1608 and proceeded MA on 5 July 1611. While his &#145;critical skill in Greek and rational head&#146; recommended him to the college, his &#145;discreet carriage, and observing head&#146;  (Lloyd, 271) prompted the unknown &#145;noble lord&#146; who was his patron to make him his chaplain and help him to the perpetual curacy of St Katharine Cree, London, where the advowson was owned by Magdalene College, Cambridge, and where he was admitted on 11 July 1611. Five years later he resigned and on 3 June 1616 was instituted as rector of St Giles-in-the-Fields, also in London. Although Lloyd says that he kept three diaries, for personal life, for recording public affairs, and for noting &#145;the most remarkable passages of Providence in the World&#146;  (ibid., 272), none appears to have survived and much about his private affairs is uncertain. He probably married during his earlier years at St Giles, since three daughters named in his will were apparently themselves married, but the identity of their mother and his first wife is unknown.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1625 Maynwaring proceeded BD and DD, and about the same time was appointed a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. When the imposition of forced loans to fund government policy aroused discontent in 1626&#150;7 he was one of several royal chaplains to heed Bishop William Laud's direction to preach on the theme of subjects' duty of obedience to their king. A sermon by Robert Sibthorpe and his own delivered at Oatlands on 4 July 1627 and at Alderton on 29 July attracted both controversy and the enthusiastic approval of Charles I. Ignoring Laud's advice &#145;to think better of it that there were many things therein which will be very distasteful to the people&#146;  (Cust, 62), the king ordered that Maynwaring's be printed with the inscription &#145;by his Majestie's special command&#146;. <span class="italic">Religion and Alegiance</span>, which appeared in August, contained much commonly accepted divine right theory: to assert that &#145;lawfull Soveraignes are no lesse then Fathers, Lords, Kings and Gods upon earth&#146;  (vol. 1, p. 4) was to uphold mainstream political thinking. However, the sermons transgressed the boundaries of that thinking in two respects: instead of vague generalizations they applied theory to particular circumstances and policies, and they extended the religious obligation of obedience in such a way as to ignore the claims of common law and parliamentary precedent. &#145;To Kings &hellip; nothing can be denyed that may further the supply of their Urgent Necessities&#146;, stated Maynwaring, who outlined what these were. Although in one breath he seemed to concede that kings might command only &#145;what stands not in any opposition to the originall Lawes of God, Nature, Nations and the Gospell&#146;, in the next he asserted that the subject was bound to obey unquestioningly, &#145;though it be not correspondent in every circumstance, to Lawes Nationall, and Municipall&#146;, on &#145;hazard of his own Damnation in rebelling against God&#146;  (vol. 1, pp. 19&#150;20). Assemblies such as parliament were instituted not as consultative bodies, &#145;to contribute any Right to Kings, whereby to challenge Tributary aydes and subsidiary helpes&#146;, but as executive bodies, which fine-tuned the details, &#145;for the more equall Imposing, and the more easie Exacting of that, which, unto Kings doth appertaine&#146;  (vol. 1, p. 26). Christ himself had shown the way. In unhesitatingly affirming that one should render to Caesar what was Caesar's, &#145;our blessed Lord did with that Readinesse, not expecting any Parliament, at Rome, or in Judea, to bee first assembled&#146;  (vol. 2, p. 37). Even though, unlike the current situation, this question was put in peacetime, &#145;no sooner was He demanded, but &hellip; Pay hee did&#146;  (vol. 2, p. 38).<br>
<br>When the next parliament opened in March 1628 Maynwaring was one of several preachers and writers associated with unpopular policies whose books were investigated by the committee for religion. Its initial report to the house on 31 March observed that &#145;they say he disavowes&#146; his sermon, &#145;owning it only so far as a way to get preferment, wherein nevertheless he says he hath failed&#146;  (Johnson and others, 2.219), but on 4 May he reiterated his views in his own pulpit at St Giles. Subsequent committee reports relayed by Francis Rous and John Pym were damning. Ready to believe that he aimed at promotion they none the less took his arguments seriously: he had invested the king with absolute power unbound by law, supported illegal action, deprived subjects of private property, and defamed parliament; in so doing he was on the verge of both blasphemy and treason. The Commons' official charge on 4 June alleged &#145;a wicked and malicious intention to seduce and misguide the conscience of the king &hellip; touching the observation of the laws and custome of this kingdom, and the rights and liberties of subjects&#146;, as well as to incite the king against those who refused the loan and &#145;to avert his Majesty's mind from calling of parliaments&#146;  (ibid., 4.102). Answering before the Lords on 13 June Maynwaring expressed sorrow and contrition, but rejected any seditious or malicious motivation, protesting that his views on divine right monarchy went no further than the scriptures or John Calvin, and did not go against law. The submission mollified the Lords slightly, but the judgment announced the following day was still severe: imprisonment during the pleasure of the house; a &pound;1000 fine to the king; formal acknowledgement of his offences before parliament; suspension for three years from the exercise of his ministry; and permanent disablement from holding any ecclesiastical dignity or secular office.<br>
<br>Brought from the Fleet prison on 21 June to make his submission Maynwaring did so, according to several accounts, with tears. However, although the king had formally expressed his concurrence on 18 June and Maynwaring's sermons were called in on 24 June to be burnt, the limits of parliamentary power to impose on Charles something so contrary to his real will rapidly became apparent. On 30 June Sir Francis Nethersole wrote in disbelief to Charles's sister the queen of Bohemia of rumours that Maynwaring would be absolved from his suspension. On 6 July Charles ordered a pardon, issued on 8 July; on 18 July he presented Maynwaring to the rectory of Stanford Rivers, Essex; and on 28 July he issued him with a dispensation to hold it <i>in commendam</i> with St Giles-in-the-Fields. If Maynwaring had suffered any loss of confidence it was soon restored. Later that year, pointing to the fact that he had been &#145;so lately bruised only for his devotion to the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1628&#150;9</i>, 421), he appealed to the latter for support in a St Giles tithe dispute which had escalated into a Star Chamber case. By late December Laud, now bishop of London, had received a paper in which he specified particularly reverential behaviour towards the king by a proposed lecturer and in the service by parishioners. Early in 1629 he lobbied Laud to oppose a move in parliament to abolish fees for burials. His confidence was well placed: awarded the additional rectories of Muckleton, Staffordshire (1630), and Mugginton, Derbyshire (1631), on 28 September 1633 he was presented by the king to the deanery of Worcester, although he was not installed until 5 September 1634.<br>
<br>There is no direct evidence that Maynwaring was or became a doctrinal Arminian, but his championing of clerical rights and his liturgical innovations reveal him to have been an enthusiastic proponent of a strong and authoritarian church and of order and ceremonial in worship. The exaction of fees at St Giles continued to cause litigation in the 1630s. By September 1635, as he reported to Archbishop Laud, whom he evidently considered his patron, he had effected significant changes in Worcester Cathedral: he had erected, decorated, and railed in a marble altar, regulated the unseemly behaviour of the choir, destroyed vestments and other ornaments debased through the misuse of the organist, Nathaniel Tompkins, and had beautified the king's audit hall. A final reward, and defiance of the 1628 sentence against Maynwaring, followed quickly. On 28 February 1636 he was consecrated by Laud as bishop of St David's in the only such ceremony of the reign attended by members of the royal family. Little is known of his episcopate, but a letter of 18 October 1637 to secretary of state Francis Windebank suggests a loyal servant of the king, and he was later accused of &#145;popish innovations&#146;.<br>
<br>With the opening of the Short Parliament in 1640 Maynwaring evidently expected retribution. On 6 April the king licensed his absence from the Lords, and he did not appear in convocation, but his original offence and later preferment were prominently remembered in debates on breaches of parliamentary privilege. The 1628 declarations against him were rehearsed, and despite a royal order on 29 April to halt proceedings, the Lords were not silenced. His name resurfaced in the Long Parliament. In February 1641 the Commons deputed a committee to review the case against him, both old scores and new allegations of his conduct at Worcester, and to draft a reversal of his pardon; his arrest was also agreed. On 25 August it was recorded in the Lords that those serving a formal summons had not found him at home, and the seizure of his temporalities was ordered. The next day, according to one diarist, John Williams, bishop of Lincoln, doubtless no friend, &#145;affirmed that he roved from alehouse to alehouse in disguise&#146; and &#145;moved his bishopric might be sequestered&#146;  (Russell, 232).<br>
<br>At some point Maynwaring had fled his diocese and seems to have gone to Ireland. In his <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Taking of Roger Manwering</span> (1642), Captain John Pointz described recognizing and apprehending him on board the <i>Eagle</i> as he made a return voyage on 28 June 1642. With him was his wife,&#145;a very neere kinswoman to him before he married her, being of the age of 22 year&#146;, but he had left &#145;his sister poore and lying in the parish where he formerly lived&#146;, and &#145;his children by his former wife to shift for themselves&#146;  (p. 2). Having landed at Minehead, Somerset, he was examined before a magistrate, Thomas Lutterall, and &#145;confessed that he departed &hellip; into Ireland, for preferment upon the Kings promise&#146;  (p. 3).<br>
<br>After a period in custody Maynwaring retired to Wales, where he lived on the income from a small estate. When he drew up his will on 29 June 1653 he was living at the college of Brecon. Leaving 5<i>s</i>. each to his &#145;eldest son&#146; Thomas and daughters Elizabeth Stevens, Mary Brooke, and Sarah Mellyn, and 20<i>s</i>. to his sister Susanna Stevens, he bequeathed the residue of his estate to his wife, Jane, whom he made the sole executor and guardian of &#145;my children&#146;. He died within hours, aged sixty-three or in his sixty-third year, and was buried on 1 July by the altar in Brecon collegiate church. For David Lloyd, royalist memoirist, this was an orderly and stern but sociable and jovial man, an improving landlord eventually hounded to his death by plunder and continual persecution. Anthony Wood stressed his zeal for the church and his keenness to bring both Catholics and sectaries to conversion and inclusion. The motivations of this most infamous of proponents of royal absolutism remain obscure.<br>
