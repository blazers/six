<span class="headword">Frail,  John</span>  (1804&#150;1879), <span class="occ">election agent</span>, was born on 1 May 1804 at Shrewsbury. A hairdresser by trade, he advanced himself through his own talents for organization, hard work, and venality. He began electioneering about 1830, under the tory whip William Holmes, among a dozen agents working to relate constituencies more closely to party. His specialities were the tedious but productive processes of voter registration and election petitions, but his other skill was &#145;the dirty work&#146; (&#145;Select committee on the Derby election&#146;, 1840; <span class="italic">VCH Shropshire</span>, 3.337) of bribery and influence. Under him, Conservatives topped the Shrewsbury polls for twenty years (1832&#150;52), with two returned in 1835 and 1841. Disraeli benefited in 1841, although he had to protest sharply to Holmes about Frail's attempt to extract more than the pre-arranged payment. Frail was also clerk of Shrewsbury and five other racecourses (1842&#150;79), and revitalized meetings with innovations such as handicapping and race-trains. He survived scandals over kick-backs and became the most important Conservative in Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>From 1847 to 1848 Frail undertook party &#145;business&#146; for William Beresford, the protectionist whip. Often this was undocumented, since it involved much covert negotiation, for which Frail (once an actor) sometimes assumed aliases and disguises. He acknowledged managing successful petitions against Liberals elected in 1847 at Carlisle and Derby, the resulting by-elections, and withdrawal of petitions against Conservatives at Colchester and Essex North (Beresford's own seat). From 1849 to 1852 he was the party's salaried agent at &pound;300 a year plus expenses, with two London locations, Cecil Street and 391 Strand. He managed elections and petitions in the City of London, Westbury, Devizes, Kidderminster (1849), St Albans (1850), and Aylesbury (1851). At the Derby election of 1852, however, his own agent, Thomas Morgan, was arrested for bribery, with &pound;300 and a letter of instructions from Beresford to Frail. At a select committee hearing in December, Frail's impassive denial of involvement undoubtedly contributed to Beresford's (qualified) exoneration, but both were removed from party management in 1853.<br>
<br>Unofficially, Frail continued to supply information and advice, but his role in later elections was less detectable and, at Shrewsbury at least, less successful. Possibly he developed interests with Liberals; possibly, as he complained to Disraeli in 1859 and Corry in 1868, local associations were neglected for &#145;more expensive&#146; boroughs  (Frail/Corry, 26 Oct 1868, MS Hughenden B/IX/G/36) by the party organization centralized under Philip Rose and Markham Spofforth.<br>
<br>Frail was married and had at least two sons, Charles Simpson Frail, a solicitor, and John Ernest Frail, both of whom succeeded him as clerks of the Shrewsbury racecourse. He died at Claremont Hill, Shrewsbury, on 9 March 1879, soon after becoming mayor. Even those who despised his tactics and sneered at his original social status admitted his &#145;sheer electioneering genius&#146;  (Sir Henry Lucy, <span class="italic">Sixty Years in the Wilderness</span>, 1912, 64). The extent of his activities indicates that statistics of party efficiency and organization in the post-<span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> decades still owed much to bribery, compromise, and self-interest.<br>
