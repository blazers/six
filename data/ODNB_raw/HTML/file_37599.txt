<span class="headword">Jenks,  Clarence Wilfred</span>  (1909&#150;1973), <span class="occ">international lawyer and director-general of the International Labour Organization</span>, was born on 7 March 1909 in Bootle, Lancashire, the son of Richard Jenks, an officer in the merchant navy, and his wife, Alice Sophia Craig. Jenks's father was lost at sea when Jenks was eleven and he effectively became head of the family. This early assumption of responsibility could explain his positive, energetic, and constructive outlook as well as the close relationship he maintained with his mother for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>Jenks's early education was in state schools in Liverpool. In 1926 he won an open scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where, from the outset, he showed that strong interest in history, politics, international relations, and law which was to characterize his whole career. He became treasurer of the British Universities League of Nations Society as well as chairman of the Cambridge University League of Nations Union. He was twice awarded a scholarship at the Institute of International Studies at Geneva, a city in which he was to spend much of his life. In 1930 he was elected president of the Cambridge Union. He was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1936.<br>
<br>In 1949 Jenks married Jane Louise Broverman, a daughter of Frederick S. Broverman of New York, who provided him with a tranquil home and unfailing social support. They had two sons, Craig and Bruce, both of whom inherited their father's international interests and outlook.<br>
<br>Jenks combined what amounted to virtually two separate, albeit closely linked, careers. In formal terms he spent the whole of his working life as an official of the International Labour Office&#151;the secretariat of the International Labour Organization (ILO)&#151;which he entered immediately on obtaining his law degree at Cambridge. He was soon made a permanent member of the legal staff and gradually advanced until he reached the position of principal legal adviser.<br>
<br>The work of the ILO, perhaps more than that of any other international organization, is reflected in legal texts: conventions regulating a wide range of matters affecting conditions of labour; reports of committees, including those scrutinizing, and even adjudicating on, the performance by members of their convention obligations; and resolutions of the general conference. In the preparation of these documents Jenks's skills were much in demand. His contribution went beyond mere technical drafting. It embraced the imaginative formulation and active negotiation of policy solutions to the many new problems confronting the organization. His knowledge of the constitutional aspects of international institutions was unrivalled. At the end of the Second World War he was the principal architect of the revision of the ILO constitution and his help was widely sought in structuring the family of United Nations specialized agencies that emerged at that time.<br>
<br>Eventually Jenks's special standing, going beyond that accorded to a distinguished and experienced lawyer, was recognized by his appointment first as assistant director-general, then as deputy director-general. In 1970 he became director-general, a post he held until his death in 1973.<br>
<br>Jenks's creative work in the ILO was illuminated by an almost passionate devotion to his vision of the objectives and higher good of the organization. He saw in the protection of the interests of all workers (a category he interpreted very broadly) a major component of the rapidly developing field of the international protection of human rights. His insistence on the independence of the international public service and his firm adherence to principle brought him early in his period as director-general into such direct conflict with the United States that for a while that country withdrew its support from the organization. In 1973 he vigorously, and successfully, opposed an initiative in the general conference which would have had Israel condemned for alleged breaches of its obligations of membership without the protection of prior judicial process.<br>
<br>Despite the intensity and demands of his official commitments, but without detracting from his performance of them, Jenks also established himself as one of the most prominent and prolific writers on international law of his time. He sought to give permanent academic expression not only to points of international law arising in the course of his official work, but also to many other matters of major importance in the international legal field. His book-length article in 1945 entitled &#145;Some constitutional problems of international organization&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Yearbook of International Law</span>, 22) was for long the unrivalled source of instruction on that subject for professionals and academics alike. He also wrote on legal subjects related to the ILO, such as the international protection of trade union rights and law, freedom, and welfare. He demonstrated his foresight and speculative ability by producing in 1965 a volume on space law so early in the development of space activities that some thought him almost unduly imaginative. Although he did not have much direct involvement in international adjudication, he published in 1964 a major study on that subject, <span class="italic">The Prospects of International Adjudication</span>.<br>
<br>Jenks was greatly sought after as a lecturer, but the rapid and intense manner of his delivery made little allowance for the frailty of his audiences who could not always fully grasp the significance of what they were hearing. During the period when he was assistant director-general of the ILO he declined to allow himself to be considered for almost certain election to one of the world's most prestigious chairs of international law. By reason, as he put it, &#145;of public duty and international public spirit by which I have felt bound&#146;, he could not, &#145;consistently with the proper discharge of duties arising from past years, leave [his] present post on [his] own initiative at a time as difficult, but as potentially fruitful, as that through which we are now passing&#146;  (private letter, Jenks archive).<br>
<br>Jenks was a member of the Institut de Droit International, during the 1973 session of which in Rome he died of a heart attack on 9 October. He was buried in Geneva on 15 October.<br>
