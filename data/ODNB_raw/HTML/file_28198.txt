<span class="headword">Verbruggen <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Percival; <em>other married name </em>Mountfort]</span>,  Susanna</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1666, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was baptized on 29 July 1666 at St Giles Cripplegate, London, the daughter of Thomas Percival (<i>d</i>. 1693?), a minor actor&#150;manager in the Duke's and United Company, and his wife, Anne Terry. Her first recorded appearance is as Winifred in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Sir Barnaby Whig</span>, for the King's Company at Drury Lane Theatre in the summer of 1681. In a letter dated 1684 Dryden already refers to her as &#145;a Comedian&#146;, a title that remained appropriate for the United Company actress who played mostly comic roles in more than sixty new plays between 1681 and 1703. As early as 1686 she had progressed not only to playing Nell, the leading role in Thomas Jevon's <span class="italic">The Devil of a Wife</span>, but also to delivering the epilogue&#151;an indication of her rising appeal and importance as an actress.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1686, at St James's, Duke's Place, Aldgate, Susanna Percival married the actor and playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19446/', "William Mountfort (c.1664&#150;1692)")</script>; they had at least four children, although only two&#151;Susanna and Mary&#151;reached adulthood. As Mrs Mountfort, Susanna continued to gain recognition for her comic acting as well as her ability to play breeches parts: &#145;a more adroit pretty Fellow than is usually seen upon the Stage&#146;  (Cibber, 166). The dedicatory epistle to <span class="italic">Sir Anthony Love</span> (1690), the play containing what was arguably her most notable breeches role, praises not only her acting skills, but suggests that Thomas Southerne wrote the role of Sir Anthony specifically for the actress: &#145;as I made every Line for her, she has mended every Word for me; and by a Gaiety and Air, particular to her Action, turn'd every thing into the Genius of the Character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Southerne</span>, 1.14&#150;20).<br>
<br>The opportunity afforded by Susanna's marriage to Mountfort was capitalized on in their appearances as a &#145;gay couple&#146;, a productive union which ended when Mountfort was murdered on 9 or 10 December 1692 by Captain Richard Hill, aided by Lord Mohun (who was found not guilty of murder in 1693). Following her husband's death Mrs Mountfort continued to act in comedies, creating, among others, the notable character of the old maid, Lady Susan Malepart, in <span class="italic">The Maid's Last Prayer</span> (1693), a &#145;Youthful Virgin of five and forty, with a selling Rump, bow Leggs, a shining Face, and colly'd Eyebrows &hellip; sure she's an Original&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Southerne</span>, 1.70&#150;72).<br>
<br>On 31 January 1694 Mrs Mountfort married <a href="#cosubject_28198">John Verbruggen [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a promising young actor, at St Clement Danes and some time afterwards moved to the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields. As Mrs Verbruggen she became one of London's best comic actresses, earning, in the year she got married, 50<i>s</i>. a week. Her last recorded roles, in 1703, were Hillaria in Thomas Baker's <span class="italic">Tunbridge Wells</span> and Whimsey in Richard Estcourt's <span class="italic">The Fair Example</span>, the latter on 10 April. According to an account written by Thomas Davies, Mrs Verbruggen died in childbirth later that year. She was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 2 September 1703 and the child, Lewis Vanbrugen, was buried the following October. Another child, John George Verbruggen, the son of John and Susanna, was baptized at St Clement Danes on 23 November 1708, although no birth record has been traced  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
<br>Susanna Verbruggen, a contemporary of Mrs Bracegirdle, appears not only to have carved out her own niche during her career but, according to one recent critic, to have influenced the repertory of the time through a willingness and ability to play, in addition to the charming heroines, &#145;ugly, foolish and low-life characters&#146;  (Howe, 84). As Cibber remarks, &#145;she was so fond of Humour, in what low Part soever to be found, that she would make no scruple of defacing her fair Form to come heartily into it&#146;  (Cibber, 165&#150;7). Although no portrait has been traced, Tony Aston offers a flattering image of her as &#145;the most pleasant creature that ever appeared &hellip; she was a fine, fair Woman, plump, full-featured; her Face of a fine, smooth Oval, full of beautiful, well-dispos'd Moles on it, and on her Neck and Breast&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Her diverse roles, variously described as the coquette, the stale virgin, the hoyden, the minx, the bawd, and the comic grotesque, give some idea of the humorous stock characters conjured ably by the actress, suggesting that both her popularity and Cibber's praise were not undeserved:<blockquote>Mistress of more variety of Humour than I ever knew in any one Woman Actress. This variety, too, was attended with an equal Vivacity, which made her excellent in Characters extremely different. &hellip; Nothing, tho' ever so barren, if within the Bounds of Nature, could be flat in her Hands. She gave many heightening Touches to Characters but coldly written, and often made an Author vain of his Work that in it self had but little Merit. (Cibber, 165&#150;7)</blockquote>
<a name="cosubject_28198"></a><span class="headword">John Verbruggen</span>  (1670?&#150;1708)<span class="occ"></span>, also said to have appeared under the name Alexander early in his career, is first recorded in United Company records in 1688. After his marriage in 1694 he appeared exclusively under his own name, playing such characters as Ambrosio in D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (1694) and Loveless in Cibber's <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span> (1697). At Lincoln's Inn Fields (where he held a share) his repertory ranged from Wilmore in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span> to Oroonoko in Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> and Edgar in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>. Described by Aston as tall, well-built, but &#145;a little In-kneed, which gave him a shambling Gate, which was a Carelessness, and became him&#146;, the actor, a rival to both George Powell and Thomas Betterton, was described as being a &#145;rough diamond&#146;, untrained but natural, and able to &#145;touch tenderly the finer feelings, as well as excite the wilder emotions of the heart&#146;  (Doran, 1.61). Verbruggen was buried on 12 March 1708 at St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
