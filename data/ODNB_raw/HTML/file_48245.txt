<span class="headword">Huth,  (John) Frederick Andrew <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>(Johann) Friedrich Andreas]</span></span>  (1777&#150;1864), <span class="occ">merchant and merchant banker</span>, was born at Stade, Hanover, on 29 October 1777, the second son of Johann Friedrich Huth (<i>d</i>. 1801), a soldier of the Scharnhorst regiment, and his wife, Marie Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of Johann Thee, farmer. The family settled in 1781 at nearby Harsefeld, where Johann Huth worked as a tailor and where Friedrich attended local schools.<br>
<br>In 1791 Huth was apprenticed to the Spanish merchants at Hamburg, Brentano Urbieta &amp; Co., led by Juan Antonio Urbieta, and twice weekly he attended the Handelsakademie to receive a formal education in commerce. Urbieta promoted him to a senior clerkship and in 1796 took him on his annual linen-buying tour of Silesia. A year later, when a change in Spanish law enabled foreign protestants both to live and to work in Spain, Urbieta dispatched Huth to his Corunna house which was managed by his brother, Cypriano. Germany's trade with Spain was then expanding rapidly, while liberalization of Spain's trade with South America presented further opportunities. From 1799 to 1803 Huth, acting as Urbieta's supercargo, made two voyages to the west coast of South America, taking out German manufactures and bringing back hides from Buenos Aires. On his return he was appointed chief clerk in Corunna.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his strong commitment to the Lutheran church, in January 1805 Huth married, at Corunna, Manuela Felipa Mayfren (1785&#150;1856), a Catholic and an orphan believed to be the daughter of a senior member of the king of Spain's court; the duke of Veragua was then her guardian. Between 1805 and 1821 they had five sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Following his marriage Huth set up in business on his own account but this was short-lived. In 1809 the invasion of Spain by France and the subsequent attack on Corunna forced the Huths' evacuation to London; apparently they took with them, for safe keeping, jewels and money belonging to the recently deposed king of Spain. In London, Huth established himself as a commission merchant, initially working with a capital of &pound;700 and doing business with Spain, in particular supplying the British army there. His business prospered and in 1815 he took into partnership a Bremen merchant, John Frederick Gruning, formerly of De Jaslet &amp; Co. As Frederick Huth &amp; Co., they moved to South Place, off Finsbury Square. Later on Huth was to move his family home to Clapton, on the outskirts of London, and then, in the late 1830s, to the fashionable residential district of Upper Harley Street in London's West End. As confirmation of the family's long-term commitment to Britain, in 1815 Huth's wife and children gave up Roman Catholicism and joined the Church of England; in 1819 the family also became naturalized British citizens by act of parliament.<br>
<br>By 1832 Huths' capital was &pound;32,000, of which &pound;22,000 was owned by Huth. In the mid-1820s the business was described as being much connected with Spain and Norway, whence arrived consignments of wool and timber respectively. &#145;Colonial produce&#146; was also exported occasionally to the continent; an important link existed in South America with a Lima house; and coffee cargoes were handled for a firm at San Domingo. &#145;There is no doubt but that their means are most ample for anything they may undertake&#146;, concluded Barings in the 1820s; &#145;Mr Huth is a most prudent &amp; circumspect man and highly thought of&#146;  (Baring archives, HC 16.1). Huths' South American business was becoming a noted specialization, following the establishment of sister houses at Lima and Valpara&iacute;so in the 1820s.<br>
<br>Huth's prestige was considerably enhanced in 1829 when the Spanish queen, Maria Christina, later queen regent, appointed him her financial adviser and banker in London; by 1836 Huth had invested &pound;300,000 of her assets in British government securities. Also in these years, Huths became financial agents for the Spanish government, charged in particular with making diplomatic payments around the world. Huth's personal reward came in 1834 with his appointment as knight of the order of Charles III; in 1852 he was advanced to commander <i>de n&uacute;mero extraordinario</i>.<br>
<br>In 1833 Huth took into partnership his clerk and future son-in-law, Daniel Meinertzhagen, originally of Bremen. This served to reinforce the German character of the firm, but it also marked Huths' commencement of new areas of business and in a new part of the world. The company was now emerging as a major accepting house concerned with financing international trade and as a house which marketed securities. An important focus of this new business was North America, and in 1839, to facilitate north Atlantic merchanting and trade finance, especially in cotton, a Liverpool house was opened. By the end of 1839 Huths' American business accounted for &pound;430,000 out of a total balance of &pound;1.2 million.<br>
<br>Huths became a &#145;major conduit&#146;  (M. Wilkins, <span class="italic">The History of Foreign Investment in the United States</span>, 1989, 56) for the passage of American securities to Europe, for the most part placing them with rich private investors in Spain and Germany. But it steered clear of public issues; no public prospectus carried its name. Its American business was damaged by the financial crisis of 1841, which resulted in a lock-up of funds, but elsewhere headway continued to be made. By the late 1840s capital had grown to over &pound;300,000 and Huths were now one of London's leading houses, ranking immediately below such companies as Barings and Rothschilds.<br>
<br>In 1850 Huth retired from day-to-day management, leaving the business in the hands of Meinertzhagen, who was assisted by Huth's first, third, and fifth sons, Charles Frederick, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14292/', "Henry Huth")</script>, and Louis. Huth's reputation was then second to none. Notwithstanding his small, slight stature, he had great presence; an obituary states that he had been known as &#145;Napoleon of the City&#146;.<br>
<br>Huth maintained links with his native Germany. At least two of his sons, Fernando and Henry, worked in Hamburg when young. In retirement he himself returned regularly to the country, and at Harsefeld in the 1840s he paid for the establishment of a library and a continuation school for able children; in 1855 he created a fund to support the village's poor; and in the late-1850s he funded the reconstruction of the local church.<br>
<br>Frederick Huth died at his residence at 33 Upper Harley Street, London, on 14 January 1864, and was buried in the family mausoleum he had had constructed in 1837 at Kensal Green cemetery. His firm remained one of the City's most prestigious houses, but after Meinertzhagen's death in 1869 it went into relative decline; it was eventually wound up in 1936, when led by Huth's great-grandsons.<br>
