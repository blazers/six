<span class="headword">Husain,  Zakir</span>  (1897&#150;1969), <span class="occ">educationist and president of India</span>, was born in Hyderabad, the third of seven sons of Fida Husain (<i>d</i>. 1905), lawyer, and his wife, Naznin (<i>d</i>. 1911). The exact date of his birth is not recorded as it is said that his mother, fearing the evil eye, did not register his birth. In his passport it was given as 24 February 1897, but in other sources it is given as 8 February. His father belonged to a well-known family of Afridi Afghans who had long settled in Kaimganj, a small town in Farrukhabad district, United Provinces. His father (Zakir's grandfather), Ghulam Husain Khan, moved to Aurangabad, then part of the nizam of Hyderabad's realm. Fida Husain turned his back on the traditional martial career of a Pathan and became a successful lawyer in Hyderabad. After his death from tuberculosis in 1905, Naznin Begum returned to Kaimganj with her sons. Zakir and his brothers studied at Islamia High School, a residential school in Etawa that combined teaching English with a strict Islamic way of life. There he studied the Koran, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, as well as English. The headmaster of this school, Syed Altaf Husain, was a nationalist and left a lasting influence on Zakir Husain. There was widespread sympathy in this school for the Turks during the Balkan wars, and boys went without food to collect funds for Turkey. In 1911 Husain's mother and other members of his family in Kaimganj died of bubonic plague.<br>
<br>In 1913 Husain joined the prestigious Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh. There he was immensely popular for his intelligence, wit, eloquence, and attractive personality. He graduated with distinction in philosophy and economics in 1918, won the Iqbal medal, took an MA in economics in 1919, and was appointed a junior lecturer. In 1915 he married Shahjehan, with whom he had three daughters, Saida, Safia, and Rokeya, who died at the age of five. In 1920 (the year that the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College became the Aligarh Muslim University) Mahatma Gandhi launched the non-co-operation movement against the British government in India and supported the <i>khilafat</i> movement for the preservation of the Turkish empire and the sovereignty of the sultan as the caliph of the Muslim world. Gandhi, together with Muhammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, went to Aligarh and appealed to the students to boycott government schools and colleges. Initially Gandhi's appeal did not get an enthusiastic response, but Husain was one of those moved by it and he decided to leave Aligarh. This changed the course of his life. Years later he said that he began his public career at the feet of Gandhi, who had been his guide and inspirer. There was a demand that for those who had left the Aligarh Muslim University there must be alternative educational facilities, and this led to the foundation of Jamia Millia Islamia (National Muslim University) in Aligarh in 1920. Husain joined Jamia on its foundation as a teacher of economics.<br>
<br>In 1922, the year of his first publication (a translation of Edwin Cannan's <span class="italic">Elementary Political Economy</span>), Husain went to Germany to continue his studies at the University of Berlin, under Werner Sombart. In 1926 he took a PhD in economics, his special subject being the agricultural policy of the British in India, but his real interest was in education. He was influenced by educationists like Eduard Spranger and Georg Kerschensteiner. There was a small group of Indian students in Berlin who met and discussed intellectual and political issues. The two lifelong friends he made there were Abid Husain and Mohammad Mujib. He also developed a close relationship with Gerda Philipsborn, a Jewish woman who had an interest in India's freedom struggle and later taught at Jamia. During his stay in Germany, Husain developed a love for European art, literature, and music, and published <span class="italic">Die Botschaft des Mahatma Gandhi</span> (1924).<br>
<br>On his return to India in 1926 Husain found Jamia (which had moved to Delhi the previous year) in a sorry plight. For the next twenty years he served the university with unsparing dedication, raising funds, improving the teaching, recruiting good lecturers, editing the university magazine, etc. He joined on a salary of Rs 100, but like his friends Abid Husain and Mohammad Mujib voluntarily reduced his salary to Rs 80, of which he claimed only half. He continued to refuse a pay rise even after he became vice-chancellor of the university in 1928. In 1935&#150;6 he oversaw the university's move to a new campus at Okhla, on the outskirts of New Delhi. In October 1937 Gandhi convened an all-India conference on national education in Wardha to consider his scheme for free, compulsory, and self-supporting education for rural areas, the essence of which was education through work. Husain attended this conference and supported Gandhi's scheme, though he disagreed that this was an original idea of Gandhi's (as he had come across similar experiments in the USA and the USSR), and was also sceptical of Gandhi's idea of self-supporting education. Despite his reservations Gandhi appointed him chairman of the committee which reported on what came to be known as the Wardha scheme of basic education. He meanwhile published and lectured widely on both economics and education.<br>
<br>In 1948, following the partition of India, Husain became vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University, which he tried to rebuild, but his experience there was not happy and he returned to Jamia in 1956. Having entered India's upper house, the Rajya Sabha, in 1952, he served as governor of Bihar from 1957 to 1962. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1954 and India's highest honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1963. He was unusual as a prominent Muslim in Indian public life at a time when, following the horrors of partition, communal loyalties had hardened and Indian Muslims had in general been increasingly marginalized. He served as vice-president of India from 1962 to 1967 and was elected president in succession to Sarvepalli Radakrishnan in May 1967. As president he remained conspicuously aloof from political controversy. He died while still in office, at the Presidential Palace, New Delhi, on 3 May 1969, following a heart attack, and was buried two days later in the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia.<br>
