<span class="headword">Mensforth, Sir  Holberry</span>  (1871&#150;1951), <span class="occ">engineer and engineering company executive</span>, was born at Snow Hill, Bradford, Yorkshire, on 1 May 1871, the second son of Edward Mensforth and his wife, Dorcas, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harrison. His father was a painter and decorator; his mother's family were machine makers, of Crabtree Harrison of Bradford. (Some socialist influence through his grandfather Thomas Mensforth probably led to his being named after a well-known Chartist leader, Samuel Holberry.)<br>
<br>Mensforth was educated until aged about twelve at Christ Church Day School in Bradford, worked briefly in a law office, and then became a millwright's apprentice at S. Clayton &amp; Co., a Bradford gas engine maker. Before completing his time he acted as foreman. Further technical instruction followed at evening classes at the mechanics' institute in Bradford in 1893&#150;4, after which he became an instructor in metalwork at the Hull Municipal Technical School in 1896&#150;7. He emerged as a versatile mechanic and toolmaker (a full member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers) and head of Clayton's engineering shop. In 1900 he married, at Shipley, Yorkshire, Alice Maud (<i>d</i>. 1948), third daughter of William Jennings of Rossington Grange Farm, near Doncaster, and Emmie Temperley. They had one daughter, Muriel (<i>b</i>. 1911), and two sons, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1901) and Eric (<i>b</i>. 1906). Both sons had distinguished engineering careers.<br>
<br>After briefly running his own gear-cutting business, Mensforth joined B. H. Thwaite's heavy engineering firm in Westminster, London, which brought him experience in the installation of gas engines and blowers in iron- and steelworks. In 1903 he joined the Trafford Park works of the American firm Westinghouse in Manchester, as a technical engineer in the engine department. (The firm produced gas engines, steam turbines, and a complete range of electrical equipment.) He made rapid progress with the firm, becoming superintendent of the engineering department in 1909, then in 1917 general manager. Mensforth was particularly successful in handling wartime labour difficulties and in increasing the output of munitions. To combat the disruptive effect on factory labour caused by the war, he set up in 1917, nine months before the Whitley councils, a works committee and staff committee. He appreciated the value of a university training and the need to attract graduates to his works. He was also a founder member and chairman of the Manchester and District Armaments Committee, which through its constituent firms&#151;Westinghouse, Crossley's, Armstrong Whitworth, and Mather and Platt&#151;aimed at ensuring a continuous supply of shells. These efforts were rewarded by a CBE and by an honorary MSc from the Manchester College of Technology in 1919.<br>
<br>After the war Sir Eric Geddes, the minister of transport, recruited Mensforth to smooth the transition of the munitions factories from war work to peacetime operations. As director-general of factories from 1920 to 1926, Mensforth successfully reduced the workforce and number of factories, won the co-operation of the unions, and introduced more commercial businesses and practices. In 1923 he was created a KCB. He was also a member in 1925 of the Biles subcommittee, which aimed to investigate the royal dockyards and their administration&#151;though the attempt to introduce more businesslike methods in this case was less successful.<br>
<br>Mensforth then took up a post as managing director of Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co. Ltd, an ailing coal, iron, steel, and chemical producer in the north-east. Alongside Henry D. McLaren, second Baron Aberconway, he helped reorganize and modernize the works, characteristically introducing joint consultation with labour, and then in 1931 negotiated its merger with another troubled iron and steel producer, Dorman Long.<br>
<br>In 1930 Mensforth accepted the chairmanship of the English Electric Company, which had been reorganized under an American syndicate. He took two important decisions: he negotiated a comprehensive technical and commercial agreement with Westinghouse and, to run the business, he made the inspired choice of one of his old Westinghouse apprentices, George H. Nelson (later first Lord Nelson). He handed over the chairmanship of English Electric in 1933 to Nelson, who continued as managing director.<br>
<br>In 1933 McLaren invited Mensforth to join the board of John Brown &amp; Co. Ltd of Sheffield, on which he served as non-executive director. Mensforth concerned himself with the engineering aspects of the collieries, steelworks, and shipyards of Browns and chaired a number of subsidiaries, such as Nasmyth Wilson of Manchester and Cravens of Sheffield. He made three influential contributions: the development of the Firth Brown Engineers' tool department in Sheffield for the manufacture of high-quality cutting tools; the purchase in 1936 of Markham &amp; Co. Ltd of Chesterfield, which strengthened Browns' engineering interests; and the recruiting of the German refugee Ludwig M. Loewy, whose designs for aluminium extrusion presses enabled Browns to close a crucial gap in British aircraft production facilities. Mensforth remained on the board of Browns until his retirement in 1945.<br>
<br>A vice-president of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association, Mensforth was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and contributed occasionally to debates. He was a member of the executive council of the National Union of Manufacturers, and in 1928 was part of a deputation received by Stanley Baldwin, calling for the safeguarding of British industries.<br>
<br>In all his posts Mensforth combined both practical skill and &#145;firmness but fairness and integrity in dealing with men and unions&#146;  (Mensforth, 55). He was not committed to any political party and served willingly either Labour or Conservative governments. He died of a cerebral thrombosis on 5 September 1951 at his home, the Red House, 347 St Johns Road, Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire.<br>
