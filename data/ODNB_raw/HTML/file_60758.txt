<span class="headword">Elwell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Glass]</span>,  Ann Catherine</span>  (1922&#150;1996), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and diplomat</span>, was born on 16 June 1922 at 12 Leinster Gardens, Bayswater, London, the only child of Robert Lionel Glass, a general practitioner and former surgeon-lieutenant in the Royal Navy, of 106 Inverness Terrace, Bayswater, and his wife, Eileen Ann, daughter of the Revd W. H. Smartt, Irish scholar and honorary canon of Manchester Cathedral. She was educated at Miss Faunce's day school in Queens Gardens, Bayswater, learning French and German from a governess, and having passed her school certificate at fifteen she was sent in 1938 to Miss Lestrange's finishing school in Florence, where she spent a year learning Italian, acquired a love of Italian opera, and became skilled in bookbinding. Back in London she learned typing, domestic science, and deportment at the Monkey Club, in Pont Street, came out as a d&eacute;butante in May 1939, and began to train as an actress at the Webber-Douglas School of Dramatic Art.<br>
<br>In May 1940, because of her fluency in languages, Ann Glass was recruited onto the temporary wartime staff of MI5 by the deputy director-general, Brigadier Harker, whom she had met at a party. When MI5 was evacuated from its temporary quarters at Wormwood Scrubs prison to Blenheim Palace in October 1940 she moved to Oxford, where she led a hectic and exhausting social life while working on Italian translations for MI5. In November 1941 she left MI5 to work on its behalf as a secretary, and later a scriptwriter, for the film company making <span class="italic">In which we Serve</span>, &#145;minding&#146; the Italian film director Filippo del Giudice, who had been released from an internment camp at Noel Coward's insistence in order to act as art director. She returned to the London office of MI5, now in St James Street, in September 1942, for the rest of the war, and continued her endless round of parties, mixing with literary figures such as Henry Yorke, who wrote novels under the pseudonym Henry Green (1905&#150;1974), and Cyril Connolly (1903&#150;1974), and her American friends Charles Collingwood, one of the CBS correspondents in London, and Dorsey Fisher, press attach&eacute; at the American embassy&#151;following the advice of her friend William Saroyan (1908&#150;1981) to &#145;live while you live&#146;. In November 1945 she was sent to Rome to take over the work of Anthony Blunt (1907&#150;1983), and spent the next ten months looking at the secret papers that had been captured with Mussolini and going through the Italian official archives, searching for documents of interest to MI5. From the end of 1946 until 1950 she worked at the head office of MI5 in Curzon Street, investigating Russian spies, and in April 1948 was sent to Egypt to lecture on double agents to security intelligence officers in the canal zone; on this trip she contracted dengue fever, and she continued to suffer bouts of ill health all her life.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1950 Ann Glass married Charles John Lister Elwell, a former naval officer newly recruited to MI5; they had two sons and two daughters. He was posted in 1950 to Singapore to a position with SIFE (security intelligence Far East), but because the head of SIFE did not like to employ women Ann had no job. She was later able to work for a branch of the commission-general for south-east Asia, engaged in countering communist propaganda, a job that she loved.<br>
<br>After five years in Singapore, where three of their children were born (the fourth was born in 1958), the Elwells returned to England in 1955. Ann became a first secretary at the information research department (IRD) of the Foreign Office, set up in 1948 to counter communism. As head of the Middle East section she travelled extensively, especially to Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, and also to Washington, collaborating closely with colleagues in the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), who were also attempting to expose the aims of the USSR and China in the Middle East. In the belief that communist propaganda would best be countered by bringing the people of these countries into contact with representatives of the best in British life she sent distinguished Englishmen, including the footballer Sir Stanley Matthews and Vic Feather, general secretary of the TUC, on missions to the Middle East. She entertained constantly, and her ability to make friends easily contributed greatly to the effectiveness of her work for the IRD. She was appointed OBE in 1970, and on her retirement in 1971 the Ariel Foundation, an organization dedicated to Anglo-Arab understanding, gave a lunch in her honour.<br>
<br>Ann Elwell combined a diplomatic career with running the family home&#151;a large house in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, which she and her husband bought in 1964. Beautiful and witty, with a deep, husky voice, she was also an excellent cook with a large collection of cookbooks, although she maintained that she did not enjoy cooking but just loved good food. She died, of cancer, on 12 January 1996 at the London Clinic, Westminster.<br>
