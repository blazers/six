<span class="headword">Pullen,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">archbishop of Tuam</span>, was baptized on 2 July 1598 at Ripley, Yorkshire, the first child, in a family of five sons and one daughter, of William Pullen (<i>d</i>. 1631), rector of Ripley, and his second wife, Johan (<i>d</i>. 1622), daughter of George Sheffield. He matriculated as a sizar from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1615, graduated BA in 1620 and proceeded MA in 1623, and was ordained deacon in York in December 1624 and priest in March 1625. In 1624 he was appointed the first headmaster of the re-endowed Leeds grammar school, minister of the New Chapel, and lecturer in St Peter's parish church, of which his father was a trustee. He married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1631), daughter of the Revd Robert Cooke, vicar of Leeds, in Leeds parish church on 8 June 1624, and they had three children&#151;Samuel (1625&#150;1656), Alexander (<i>b</i>. 1626), and William (1629&#150;1668). His wife died on 17 November 1631 and he married second, on 20 December 1632 in Pontefract parish church, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1667), daughter of Peter Bramhall of Carlton near Pontefract, the sister of John Bramhall, later bishop of Derry and archbishop of Armagh.<br>
<br>In 1632 Pullen accompanied the marquess (later James, first duke) of Ormond, as his private chaplain, to Ireland and there he gained preferment in the Church of Ireland. On 5 June 1634 he was installed as prebendary of Killamery in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, where in 1636 he was appointed to the chancellorship which he held with the rectory of Knockgraffon in co. Tipperary. To these preferments, in 1638 he added the deanery of Clonfert, co. Galway. He was residing in Cashel, co. Tipperary, at the outbreak of the Irish rising of 1641, in the course of which he lost goods and property to the value of &pound;4652, escaping to England only after a period of three months during which he was sheltered by a Jesuit, James Saul (or Sall) &#145;who had received from the Dean several favours which caused James Saul to preserve the Dean from being murthered&#146;  (Nalson and Ware, 2.98). While in England Pullen was chaplain to Aubrey de Vere, earl of Oxford, whose wife, a Roman Catholic, introduced him to a shoemaker who was a much admired preacher. Pullen recognized the preacher as James Saul, whom he thanked &#145;for preserving his life in Ireland &hellip; and as you saved mine, I shall save yours&#146;  (ibid., 2.100). He prevailed on the earl and countess of Oxford to do Saul no harm providing he left Oxfordshire, and thereby the countess was said to have returned to the Church of England.<br>
<br>After returning to Ireland, in 1642 Pullen was awarded the degree of DD by the University of Dublin, and in October of the same year was collated to the prebend of Swords in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, which he held until the Restoration when, on the recommendation of the duke of Ormond, he was appointed archbishop of Tuam and bishop of Kilfenora. Pullen was one of twelve bishops who were consecrated by his brother-in-law, the archbishop of Armagh, John Bramhall, in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 27 January 1661. His sojourn as archbishop of Tuam was unremarkable and short, for he died on 24 January 1667 at about five or six in the evening and was buried on 27 January in St Mary's Cathedral, Tuam, &#145;iuxta thronum archiepiscopalem&#146; (&#145;next to the archiepiscopal throne&#146;) under an inscribed stone which was subsequently removed from the cathedral and inserted in a boundary wall. Under the terms of his will, dated 10 January 1667, in which the principal legatees were his wife and son, William, he left houses in Patrick Street, Dublin, leased from the dean and chapter, rents of lands in co. Galway, furniture, coaches, and &pound;600 to buy land, while his books were left to his nephew Tobias, later bishop of Cloyne and bishop of Dromore. Despite his pedagogical background and his ownership of books, he left no writings. Likewise as priest and bishop he left no permanent mark on the life of the Church of Ireland.<br>
