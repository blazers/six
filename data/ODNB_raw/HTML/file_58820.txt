<span class="headword">MacDonagh,  Thomas Stanislaus</span>  (1878&#150;1916), <span class="occ">poet and critic</span>, was born on 1 February 1878 in Cloughjordan, co. Tipperary, one of the eight children of Joseph MacDonagh (1834&#150;1894), a schoolteacher, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parker (<i>d</i>. 1908), also a teacher. His parents were both Roman Catholics; his mother, formerly a protestant, had converted before her marriage. MacDonagh inherited his good humour from his father, his literary leanings from his mother, and from an early age displayed a lively imagination, delighting in jokes, riddles, and ghost stories. He also developed an interest in poetry and put together small books of rhymes.<br>
<br>At fourteen MacDonagh was sent to Rockwell College, near Cashel, co. Tipperary, founded by the Holy Ghost Fathers, a French religious order. A junior scholasticate attached to the college prepared priests for missionary work. Academically, the school had a good record and MacDonagh was a conscientious though not outstanding student. In 1894, the year of his father's death, he decided to enter religious life. As a novice he wore the clerical garb of the order and taught English, French, and Latin to junior pupils, but in 1901 he abandoned his studies for the priesthood and left Rockwell.<br>
<br>MacDonagh's next teaching post was at St Kieran's College, Kilkenny. There he joined the Gaelic League, receiving his &#145;baptism in Nationalism&#146;  (Parks and Parks, 8) and in 1902 he visited the Aran Islands to improve his command of spoken Gaelic. MacDonagh's first book of poetry, <span class="italic">Through the Ivory Gate</span>, had been published at his own expense in 1902. It was dedicated to W. B. Yeats to whom he had sent the manuscript, requesting advice. Yeats advised against publication because he felt that MacDonagh had not found himself as a poet. A second book, <span class="italic">April and May</span>, followed in 1903. Religion, nationalism, beauty, and nature were the dominant themes in these early efforts and were to recur in his later work. In 1903 he began teaching at St Colman's College, Fermoy, co. Cork. A sacred cantata, <span class="italic">The Exodus</span>, for which he wrote the lyrics, won the prize at the 1904 Dublin Feis Ceoil, and in 1908 he published another book of poetry, <span class="italic">The Golden Toy</span>.<br>
<br>In 1908 MacDonagh joined Patrick Pearse as assistant head teacher at the newly established St Enda's school for boys in Dublin, where all aspects of Gaelic culture were enthusiastically promoted and Irish plays and pageants were regularly performed. MacDonagh was himself a playwright but he made little lasting impact. <span class="italic">When the Dawn is Come</span>, performed at The Abbey in 1908, depicts an Irish rising against English rule and centres on the antagonism between two of the leaders. One reviewer described it as the &#145;first Sinn F&eacute;in drama&#146; and hailed it as the best Abbey production for two years  (Parks and Parks, 102&#150;3). Pupils of St Enda's returned from a performance &#145;yearning for rifles&#146;  (ibid., 104). All told, however, the play was not deemed to be a success.<br>
<br>By this time, in addition to his several volumes of poetry, MacDonagh had published articles in such journals as <span class="italic">The Nation</span> (London), <span class="italic">The Leader</span>, and <span class="italic">T. P.'s Weekly</span>. He was well known in Dublin literary and theatrical circles, with friends and acquaintances including Padraic Colum, James Stephens, George Russell (A. E.), Arthur Griffith, and James Connolly. His closest friends were Pearse and Joseph Plunkett. In appearance, MacDonagh was of stocky build with brown hair, grey eyes, a prominent nose, and a friendly expression. On formal occasions he wore a kilt. He was active on many fronts. In 1909 he was a founder member of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland. He was also a member of both the Irish Women's Franchise League and the National Literary Society, but he had become disillusioned with the Gaelic League.<br>
<br>In 1910 MacDonagh was awarded a BA, having studied part-time at University College, Dublin, and spent time in Paris studying French literature and philosophy. <span class="italic">Songs of Myself</span> (1910), the title reflecting Walt Whitman's influence, included two of MacDonagh's best poems, &#145;John-John&#146; and &#145;Envoi&#146;. A year later he received an MA for his thesis &#145;Thomas Campion and the art of poetry&#146; and with Colum, Stephens, and David Houston founded the monthly <span class="italic">Irish Review</span>. Later in the year he was appointed lecturer in English at University College, Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1910 MacDonagh's love affair with Mary Maguire (later to marry Colum) ended. A relationship with Muriel Gifford led to marriage on 3 January 1912. Muriel Gifford was one of twelve children of a mixed marriage and had been brought up as a protestant. MacDonagh considered that he and his wife were of the same religion, neither Catholic nor protestant, and they attended neither church nor chapel  (Parks and Parks, 28). Her parents did not approve of the marriage, but the couple set up house at 32 Baggot Street near St Stephen's Green, later moving to 29 Oakley Road in Ranelagh, a southside suburb. A son, Donagh, was born in November 1912 and a daughter, Barbara, in 1915.<br>
<br>MacDonagh's second play, <span class="italic">Metempsychosis</span>, was staged in the Theatre of Ireland in 1912. A satire on theosophy and reincarnation, it had as one of the central characters Lord Winton Winton de Winton, a caricature of Yeats. Reviews were poor. In the meantime the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span> was plagued by money troubles and in 1913 Plunkett assumed the financial burden and replaced Colum as editor.<br>
<br>During the momentous industrial dispute that shook Dublin in 1913 MacDonagh was a member of the Dublin Industrial Peace Committee. Giving evidence to an inquiry into disturbances during the dispute, he told of a street riot where he heard the &#145;continual rapping of [police] batons on people's heads&#146;  (Kee, 2.199).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Lyrical Poems</span> (1913) is MacDonagh's most accomplished work and combined a selection of old and new poems, most notably &#145;The night hunt&#146;. His &#145;Yellow bittern&#146;, a translation of &#145;An Bun&aacute;n Bu&iacute;&#146; by the eighteenth-century poet Cathal Bu&iacute; Mac Giolla Ghunna, showed real poetic advance. However, MacDonagh never fully matured as a poet. He tended to rush into print and his work suffered from insufficient revision. Much of his poetry was obscure and baffling, especially his mystical poems.<br>
<br>MacDonagh's MA thesis was published as <span class="italic">Thomas Campion and the Art of English Poetry</span> in 1913. A treatise on English metrics and rhyme, it asserted that there were two main types of English verse: song verse and speech verse; a third type, chant, lay somewhere between the two. The assumption that Campion was of Irish extraction was strongly disputed.<br>
<br>Through their involvement in amateur drama productions, MacDonagh and Plunkett became convinced of the need for a new professional theatre to stage Irish and continental drama. It was left to MacDonagh to get the project off the ground. Financed in large measure by Edward Martyn and managed by MacDonagh's brother John, the Irish Theatre finally opened in November 1914, but MacDonagh had little time for literary endeavour in the last two years of his life. Late in 1913 he joined the Irish Volunteers on their foundation and became a member of the central provisional committee. He wrote the &#145;Marching song of the Irish Volunteers&#146; and, as commander of one of the four companies of the Dublin brigade, was active in overseeing the training of recruits. He also addressed recruiting rallies around the country and was involved in the Howth gun-running in 1914.<br>
<br>When the volunteers split over attitudes to the war, the Redmondite majority became known as the National Volunteers. The minority Irish Volunteers appointed a new headquarters staff with MacDonagh as director of training. He was confident that Irish freedom would be secured by &#145;zealous martyrs&#146;, through peace, he hoped, but by war if necessary  (Parks and Parks, 52).<br>
<br>In 1915, the year that he was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), MacDonagh was a member of the committee that took charge of the funeral arrangements of the exiled Fenian Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, who had died in the United States. The IRB seized the opportunity to stage a militant nationalist pageant. The National Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army took part. But it was the Irish Volunteers who fired the volley over the grave and Pearse who gave the oration. In a Rossa funeral souvenir, MacDonagh wrote of the volunteer's ideal &#145;that leads him now to battle, to sacrifice and to victory&#146;  (Parks and Parks, 55).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Pagans</span>, based on the poem &#145;John-John&#146;, was presented at the Irish Theatre in 1915. A literary drama, it explored the conflict between the conventional and bohemian philosophies of life. It was not without merit but was ill served by an inferior production.<br>
<br>MacDonagh took to turning up for classes at University College, Dublin, in uniform, complete with officer's sword. One of his students, Austin Clarke, remembered him placing a revolver on the desk during a lecture  (Norstedt, 121). There were complaints and MacDonagh reverted to wearing civilian attire at work.<br>
<br>By spring 1916 the IRB's plans for revolt were well advanced. Irish volunteer activities were stepped up. There were frequent marches through the streets of Dublin and, when plans were announced for Easter Sunday manoeuvres, MacDonagh instructed all volunteers to turn up with full equipment. &#145;Boys&#146; he told the men directly under his command, &#145;some of us may never come back&#146;  (Kee, 2.270). On hearing of Roger Casement's arrest in Kerry, the volunteers' chief-of-staff Eoin MacNeill issued eleventh-hour instructions rescinding the orders for Easter Sunday. Confusion ensued and a military council that included MacDonagh met on Sunday and determined that the rising would proceed the following day. MacDonagh was one of the seven signatories of the proclamation of the provisional government read by Pearse outside the General Post Office at noon on Easter Monday. The rising, largely confined to Dublin, enjoyed little popular support. It quickly became clear that it would fail. MacDonagh, in command of the garrison at Jacob's biscuit factory which was near Dublin Castle, was initially reluctant to obey Pearse's order to surrender. Only when he was convinced that resistance was futile did he comply.<br>
<br>Courts martial were held without delay and on Tuesday 2 May, MacDonagh was tried and found guilty. A priest heard his confession in his cell at Kilmainham gaol and he also received communion. His only other visitor was his sister Mary, Sister Francesca of the Sisters of Charity. In a farewell letter to his wife MacDonagh wrote, &#145;I am ready to die, and I thank God that I die in so holy a cause. My Country will reward my dust richly&#146;  (Parks and Parks, 70). At 3.30 am on Wednesday 3 May he was executed by firing squad. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in Arbour Hill barracks the same day. His sister-in-law Grace Gifford married Joseph Plunkett hours before he too was executed.<br>
<br>MacDonagh's <span class="italic">Literature in Ireland: Studies Irish and Anglo-Irish</span> was published posthumously in 1916 and advanced an inclusive theory of the Irish literary tradition. MacDonagh rejected Arnold's &#145;Celtic note&#146; in favour of the term, the &#145;Irish mode&#146;. At its best, he contended, Irish literature in English had its own unique qualities that drew on race and nationality and which echoed the patterns and rhythms of Gaelic speech and song. The Anglo-Irish literature that mattered was the work of first-generation English speakers of rural origin. MacDonagh borrowed freely from the ideas of others but the strength of his literary criticism derived from his synthesis of these ideas and his passionate advocacy of them. <span class="italic">Literature in Ireland</span> broke new ground and continues to be of relevance.<br>
<br>The poet Francis Ledwidge, a member of the British army who died at Ypres in 1917, wrote an elegy &#145;He shall not hear the bittern cry&#146; for MacDonagh. A. E., who did not support the rising, also paid tribute in &#145;Salutation&#146;, while Yeats, in &#145;Easter, 1916&#146;, wrote of MacDonagh's unfulfilled promise.<br>
<br>MacDonagh's widow, Muriel, was received into the Roman Catholic church at Easter 1917. She drowned in July of that year while swimming in the sea at Skerries, north of Dublin. The children were embroiled in a custody dispute between the MacDonagh and Gifford families that marred their childhood years. Thomas MacDonagh's son and a granddaughter continued the family literary tradition.<br>
