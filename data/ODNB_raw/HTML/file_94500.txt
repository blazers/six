<span class="headword">Gardiner,  Margaret Emilia</span>  (1904&#150;2005), <span class="occ">patron of the arts</span>, was born on 22 April 1904 in Berlin, the only daughter and second of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33322/', "Sir Alan Henderson Gardiner (1879&#150;1963)")</script>, Egyptologist, and his wife, Hedwig (Heddie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> von Rosen (<i>d</i>. 1964), who was of part Hungarian Jewish and part Scandinavian descent. Her elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59314/', "(Henry) Rolf Gardiner (1902&#150;1971)")</script>, ecological campaigner. The family was wealthy, in large part through inheritance from her paternal grandfather.<br>
<br>In 1911 the family moved from Berlin to London, where Gardiner attended the Froebel School in Hammersmith before going on to Bedales School, Hampshire. In 1923 she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, to read modern languages, switching in her second term to moral science. Later she dropped her university studies in favour of Russian. She wrote, &#145;I wasn't taking work very seriously. For me there was too much else in Cambridge, all the intoxicating excitements of meeting people, of talk and ideas. And besides, I didn't really need to work&#146;, noting that &#145;I took it for granted that every young man I got to know would fall in love with me&#146;  (Footprints, 4&#150;5). Many did. She was attractive, with an intelligent, eager face and a bob of thick hair. Later in life she wore jewellery from the south seas or Asia and loose colourful clothes. Her scarlet nail polish horrified Barbara Hepworth during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Gardiner's first great love was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75494/', "(Arthur) Bernard Deacon (1903&#150;1927)")</script>, an ethnologist she met in 1925 just before he left Cambridge to study marriage systems in Malekula in the New Hebrides. Unresolved before they parted, love developed through a series of letters in which he called her &#145;Margou &hellip; the pet name my family sometimes used&#146;  (<span class="italic">Footprints</span>, 2). He died of blackwater fever aged twenty-four in 1927, just as Gardiner was poised to live with him in Australia. She travelled to Vanuatu to visit Deacon's grave on the fifty-sixth anniversary of his death and in 1984 published a memoir, <span class="italic">Footprints on Malekula</span>.<br>
<br>After Deacon's death, rudderless, Gardiner studied at the Froebel Institute of Education and briefly became an elementary school teacher in Cambridgeshire, but her liberal ideas, influenced by A. S. Neill, clashed with those of the headmaster and parents. She moved to Hampstead, initially lodging in Elm Row with H. S. (Jim) Ede, then an assistant at the Tate Gallery and later the creator of Kettle's Yard, Cambridge, to be near Barbara Hepworth, to whom she had been introduced by the zoologist Solly Zuckerman, Gardiner's then boyfriend. When her affair with Zuckerman ended Gardiner became involved with Adrian Stokes, the painter and art critic. He described her &#145;genius for friendship&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 Jan 2005); Gardiner herself recognized that &#145;everything in my life has resulted from friendships&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scatter of Memories</span>, 22), which included those with Louis MacNiece, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Stevie Smith. Some of her pieces of writing, fictional, autobiographical, or memoir, were later published together in 1988 as <span class="italic">A Scatter of Memories</span>, while her friendships inspired a Channel 4 documentary, <span class="italic">Time is a Country</span>, broadcast on Christmas day the same year.<br>
<br>Gardiner became Hepworth's confidante when the sculptor first met Ben Nicholson. Later unofficial godmother to Hepworth and Nicholson's triplets, Gardiner often visited the circle of artist friends who moved to St Ives during the Second World War. Enjoying a private income, she supported Hepworth and Nicholson through purchases of their work as well as practical help like cooking. Gardiner and Hepworth later travelled to Greece together and she provided the guarea wood for some of Hepworth's finest sculptures. She also acquired works from many other artists, including Naum Gabo and Alfred Wallis, the fisherman painter. She saw these works, and others bought from a younger generation of St Ives artists, not as a formal collection but as evidence of personal connections. She said she was not fundamentally interested in visual art but loved the company of artists. Nevertheless she was later one of the founders of the Institute of Contemporary Arts.<br>
<br>The art Gardiner acquired was of a domestic scale appropriate to the small regency house with its modernist interior in Hampstead where she lived from 1937 until her death. She lived there with her son, Martin (<i>b</i>. 1937), but not with his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30813/', "(John) Desmond Bernal (1901&#150;1971)")</script>, a distinguished Cambridge scientist with active interests in art and politics and a complex relationship with women. Once, introduced as Mrs Bernal and being challenged, Gardiner is supposed to have replied brightly, &#145;Oh. There are hundreds of us&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Politically Gardiner was on the left, like Bernal, but she was never a member of the Communist Party. Swept up in the anti-fascist movements of the 1930s and a brilliant organizer, she was the driving force behind For Intellectual Liberty, and its secretary. A close political colleague at this time was Leonard Woolf, whom she liked, but whose wife Virginia she found &#145;very snubbing, very unpleasant&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 Jan 2005). She later supported American draft resistance during the Vietnam War and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was treasurer of the International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace.<br>
<br>Gardiner's most remarkable achievement was the permanent home she created for her works of art. She and Martin Bernal visited Orkney in 1956 while he was on leave from national service in the RAF and discovered Orcadian archaeology and hospitality. On a whim, she purchased a house on Rousay and later, at her son's suggestion, gave the people of Orkney the bulk of her art collection. As the collection was enlarged by numerous gifts from artist friends who had become highly successful, this was an outstandingly generous gesture. Her organizing skills and persuasive talents created a museum, the Pier Arts Centre, which linked Stromness to the sites most associated with British modernism and with her life: Hampstead, Cambridge, and St Ives. Ben Nicholson commented that the Pier was so far away. &#145;It all depends where you start from&#146;, retorted Gardiner  (private information). Having reached a century, she died on 2 January 2005 at Heathgrove Lodge nursing home, 837 Finchley Road, Golders Green, London, of cardiopulmonary degeneration. She was survived by her son, Martin, a distinguished sinologist.<br>
