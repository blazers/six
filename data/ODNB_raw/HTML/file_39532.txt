<span class="headword">Rogers,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1558), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, is of obscure origins. He was probably apprenticed to a mason and is likely to have been the John Rogers of London, freemason, who worked as a stonesetter and carver at Hampton Court between 1533 and 1537. In the late spring of 1541 he was appointed master mason to Gu&icirc;nes Castle, on the southern edge of the Calais pale, and thereafter devoted most of his career to the service of the crown. At Gu&icirc;nes he and Richard Lee (surveyor of works) introduced new methods of fortification, drawn partly from Italian military engineers. Rogers started to be noticed favourably by the king, who also employed him as a spy, reporting on French fortifications outside the Calais pale. Increasingly involved in military engineering, Rogers was appointed surveyor of works at Hull in autumn 1541. There he was responsible for the detail, perhaps the overall concept, of the new fortifications; he was chief technical supervisor of the construction work, had administrative duties, and either executed or directed making plans.<br>
<br>While he was at Hull Rogers began to be employed by Henry VIII as a technical consultant. At a time of increasingly severe Anglo-Scottish hostilities he went in April 1542 to view the fortifications at Berwick, and in June to report on possible improvements to Wark Castle, Northumberland, and to make plans. On 1 January 1543 he was granted an annuity of &pound;36 10<i>s</i>., more than twice the amount usually paid to the king's master masons. As the work at Hull drew to an end, in the autumn of 1543, Rogers's move to Carlisle was contemplated, though there is no evidence he ever went. He was employed as a spy again; in December he was to go to Tantallon Castle, Haddingtonshire, and he returned to the area in early June 1544. On 28 February 1544 Rogers had been appointed clerk of the ordnance; he was only active until July 1544, but held the office until his death.<br>
<br>The appointment of Rogers in September 1544 as surveyor of works at Boulogne, immediately after the English capture of the town, led to his attaining eminence as one of the foremost military engineers of his time. He was assisted at first by such advisers as Sir Richard Lee and John Burgate but after one month the works at the haven entrance were placed under Thomas Palmer. By March 1546, however, Rogers was in sole charge. He was a central figure in the transformation of English fortifications and by now both he and Lee were well abreast of the latest continental developments in the science; the fortifications at Boulogne were constructed strictly according to the new Italianate principles. He also acted once more as a spy. In July 1545, he was to make a plan of the French camps and fortifications on the southern side of the River Liane.<br>
<br>As an architectural and topographical draughtsman Rogers was held in high esteem by his contemporaries. His plans used up-to-date practices; examples survive that are drawn to scale and give scale bars, dimensions, and elevations. These were probably the skills that led to his involvement with the diplomatic negotiations preceding and following the treaty of Camp, signed on 7 June 1546, ending the war between France and England. Rogers was a special diplomatic attach&eacute;: he surveyed the disputed lands and produced drawings as a basis for the negotiations, participated in some of the discussions, and liaised between diplomats in France and the king in England.<br>
<br>Rogers reputedly spoke plainly and bluntly, and was often at odds with his administrative superiors. His position became more precarious after Henry VIII, who had trusted Rogers's judgement, died on 28 January 1547, but Edward VI's administration continued to employ him. Consequently, although Rogers remained at Boulogne until the very end of the English occupation in March 1550 (he was still surveyor of works there in the previous month), his growing reputation as a harbour engineer earned him commissions to investigate problems at a number of harbours on the south coast of England. In June 1548 he was sent to Folkestone and Dover; later that summer he became chief technical officer in a project to overcome the silting-up of Sandwich haven, and this work continued until November 1551.<br>
<br>After Rogers left Boulogne, he gave advice in projects for the defence of Alderney, Guernsey, Folkestone, and possibly Sheerness. In spring 1551 he went to Ireland in connection with proposed fortifications on the south coast, but plans collapsed through lack of funds. In February 1552 he went to inspect Gu&icirc;nes Castle and returned via Dover, where he viewed the pier, which he inspected again in October the next year. In May and June 1552 he worked on the fortifications at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>Rogers did not have an official position again until November 1556, when he was appointed surveyor of the queen's works at Berwick. His tenure was brief; he became surveyor of fortifications, works and repairs at Calais on 6 December, with a yearly salary of &pound;20, a life annuity of &pound;10, and a house. He was probably taken prisoner either on the fall of Calais, on 7 January 1558, or on that of Gu&icirc;nes on the twentieth. Still a prisoner on 16 March, he was probably dead by the twenty-fifth. His will, made on 6 August 1557, was proved on 10 May 1559. In a document which may indicate protestant sympathies, he left to his wife, Agnes, and her heirs his house in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, London (granted to him on 17 January 1548), his lease of the lordship of Street, Somerset (granted to him in May 1552 for twenty-one years), and his lease of Folkestone Priory. In recognition of her late husband's long services, Agnes was granted an annuity of 20 marks on 17 July 1559.<br>
