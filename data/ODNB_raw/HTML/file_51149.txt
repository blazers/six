<span class="headword">Daunt,  William Joseph O'Neill</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Denis Ignatius Moriarty]</span>  (1807&#150;1894), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born at Tullamore, King's county, Ireland, on 28 April 1807, the oldest of five children of Joseph Daunt (1779&#150;1826) of Kilcascan, co. Cork, landowner and militia captain, and his first wife, Jane Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1816), daughter of the Revd Thomas Wilson, rector of Ardstraw, co. Tyrone. The Daunts, English protestants, had acquired land in co. Cork in the late 1500s; in 1828, breaking with family and class traditions, young Daunt became a Roman Catholic. He attributed his conversion to the influence of his tutor and his perusal of Catholic literature, although complicated psychological reasons involving his family may have played a more significant role.<br>
<br>A prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Daniel O'Connell, Daunt was MP for Mallow in 1832&#150;3, until unseated on petition. A charter member of the Repeal Association from 1840, he was field director successively for Leinster, Ulster, and Scotland. In 1841&#150;2, he was O'Connell's secretary while the latter was lord mayor of Dublin. In 1842 Daunt collaborated with Thomas Davis, John Blake Dillon, and Charles Gavan Duffy to found the Dublin <span class="italic">Nation</span>. He contributed occasionally to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, but later distanced himself from it and the associated Young Ireland movement. Daunt was close to O'Connell during the repeal leader's declining years in 1844&#150;7, but after his death retired from politics.<br>
<br>Daunt re-emerged in 1856 to help found the Irish church disestablishment movement, and remained active until the <span class="roman">Disestablishment Act</span> became law in 1869. Although Catholic, Daunt worked closely on disestablishment with the intensely protestant English Liberation Society. In 1862, the liberationists invited him to join their executive council, but he declined. After Daunt and other Irish disestablishmentarians founded the National Association of Ireland in 1864, the liberationists supported it on the basis of &#145;uncompromising voluntarism&#146; for religious bodies; this alliance would have been impossible if Daunt had not persuaded the Irish Catholic hierarchy to renounce the British government's grant to Maynooth College for training priests.<br>
<br>Daunt deprecated papal and episcopal denunciations of secular republican organizations such as the Fenians, and generally urged complete separation of church and state. From his connection with the Liberation Society he became friendly with John Bright and other English Liberals, but was distrustful and critical of W. E. Gladstone. In 1870 Daunt joined Isaac Butt's Home Government Association. As one of the few important surviving O'Connellites he exerted considerable behind-the-scenes influence in what became the Home Rule League, until Butt's death in 1879. He supported Butt against the Parnellites, but unlike Butt he saw the value of parliamentary obstruction as a tactical weapon against English politicians. Although never a Parnellite, Daunt viewed home rule as the best attainable goal short of full repeal of the union.<br>
<br>In July 1839 Daunt married Ellen Hickey (<i>d</i>. 1897), daughter of Daniel Hickey. The couple had one son and one daughter. Daunt in his last years rarely left his estate at Kilcascan, co. Cork, but contributed prolifically to the press, especially concerning Irish finance, on which he was an acknowledged expert.<br>
<br>Daunt wrote numerous books on political and economic issues and Irish history, and four novels, three of them under the pseudonym Denis Ignatius Moriarty. His <span class="italic">Personal Recollections of Daniel O'Connell</span> (2 vols., 1848) is an important record of the Liberator's political conversations and non-political anecdotes. <span class="italic">A Life Spent for Ireland</span> (1896) is a selection of extracts from Daunt's voluminous journals kept between 1842 and 1888, edited by his daughter, Alice Ismene Daunt. His writing style is dry, pithy, and readable, although frequently rambling. Daunt died at Kilcascan, Ballyneen, co. Cork, on 29 June 1894.<br>
<br>Too introverted and reclusive, and possibly too scrupulous to be a successful politician, Daunt was nevertheless important as a link between the repeal and home-rule movements, and as an observer and chronicler of Irish nationalist politics for over sixty years. His unpublished journals and letters to scores of correspondents, as well as his many published works, are major historical sources, significant for their factual accuracy and broadmindedness.<br>
