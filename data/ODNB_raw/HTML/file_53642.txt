<span class="headword">Drower <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stevens]</span>,  Ethel May Stefana</span>, Lady Drower  (1879&#150;1972), <span class="occ">orientalist and novelist</span>, was born on 1 December 1879 in North Road, Highgate, Middlesex, the first of the four daughters of the Revd Silas William Stevens (1856&#150;1916), rector of Burley, Hampshire, and then St Lawrence, Southampton, and his wife, Susan Ellen (1845?&#150;1932), formerly Dean, daughter of William Carpenter and his wife, Ann. She attended a boarding-school near Bournemouth and then worked as a freelance journalist, travel companion, and novelist. Several journeys took her to different countries in the Near East and find their reflection in her early novels: <span class="italic">The Veil</span> (1909), <span class="italic">The Mountain of God</span> (1911), and <span class="italic">The Earthen Drum</span> (1911), a collection of oriental tales. On her travel to Sudan, of which she gives an account in <span class="italic">My Sudan Year</span> (1912), she met in Khartoum Edwin Mortimer Drower (1880&#150;1951), a lawyer whom she married in 1911. They had three children: one daughter, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1911) and two sons, William (<i>b</i>. 1915) and Denys (<i>b</i>. 1918). Having children did not stop her from writing, and numerous novels appeared during this period, all of which were published under her maiden name. They are entertaining, but for the most part have no great literary value. However, <span class="italic">The Mountain of God</span> does have lasting value as the story centres around the belief, cult, and political persecution of the sect of the Baha&#146;is who have their sanctuary, the tomb of Baha&#146; &#145;Ullah, on Mount Carmel in Haifa.<br>
<br>This novel demonstrated an observational and descriptive talent that was also apparent in Drower's many travel books and articles on the cult and rites of various minor religious and ethnic groups in the Near East (Iraq, Persia, Syria), including <span class="italic">By Tigris and Euphrates</span> (1923), <span class="italic">Cedars, Saints and Sinners</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">Peacock Angel</span> (1941). In the last book Drower describes a religious sect in northern Iraq, the Yezidis. Her husband was a British government official, stationed from 1919, in Basrah; and later he was (until 1947) adviser to the minister of justice in Baghdad; he was knighted in 1941. But Drower did not restrict herself to the role of an &#145;official&#146; wife. Some of her time she devoted to travel and to learning Arabic. As a woman she had access to the women's quarters which were normally denied to men. A remarkable outcome is her collection from the vernacular of many folk and fairy tales from Baghdad, Mosul, and surroundings. A selection of those forms the well-known book <span class="italic">Folk-Tales of &#145;Iraq</span> (1931). She was the first to collect stories from this area. It was just in time before modern inventions such as the gramophone and the cinema replaced this oriental art of entertainment.<br>
<br>The second period of Drower's life was devoted to the only surviving gnostic group from antiquity, the Mandaeans, who are called in Arabic as-Subbis, &#145;baptizers&#146;, a sect of observers and owners of secret rites and knowledge who are a product of the ancient oriental and hellenistic syncretism, the gnosis. A detailed description is found in her study of this sect, <span class="italic">The Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran</span> (1937) which by the close of the twentieth century had not been superseded. She won the trust of the Mandaeans so that some members of this sect sold her copies of manuscripts which were allowed to be read and studied only by their priests. These formed the basis of <span class="italic">The Secret Adam</span> (1960). The fifty-four manuscripts are kept now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, as the Drower collection. <span class="italic">Water into Wine</span> (1956), a comparison of ritual meals, owes much to her study of different religious groups. Without any scholarly education Drower learned Aramaic and mastered the translation of very important Mandaic manuscripts; these publications are of great value for the study of the culture and language of the only remaining gnostic sect in the twentieth century: <span class="italic">Book of the Zodiac</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Diwan Abathur</span> (1950), <span class="italic">&#352;arh &#7695; Qabin &#7695; &#352;i&#353;lam Rba</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Haran Gawaita and the Baptism of Hibil-Ziwa</span> (1953), <span class="italic">The Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans</span> (1959), <span class="italic">The Thousand and Twelve Questions</span> (1960), <span class="italic">The Coronation of the Great &#352;i&#353;lam</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">A Pair of Nasoraean Commentaries</span> (1963). She also contributed many articles to scholarly journals such as <span class="italic">Iraq</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span>. <span class="italic">A Mandaic Dictionary</span> (1963) was drawn from her vast word collection, in collaboration with Rudolf Macuch. She was honoured for her scholarly achievements with several degrees, an honorary DLitt from Oxford University and an honorary DD from Uppsala University, as well as being made an honorary fellow of the School of Oriental and African Studies of London University. On 1 October 1964 she was awarded the greatest honour for a scholar in Semitic languages, the Lidzbarski gold medal, for her work on Mandaic, a very important and interesting branch of eastern Aramaic. She died on 27 January 1972 in London.<br>
