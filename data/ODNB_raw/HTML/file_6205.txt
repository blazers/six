<span class="headword">Cooper,  Abraham</span>  (1787&#150;1868), <span class="occ">battle and animal painter</span>, was born on 8 September 1787 at Red Lion Street, Holborn, London. His father was a tobacconist and later became an innkeeper at Holloway and for a time at Edmonton, but with little financial success. Cooper attended a local school and showed an early aptitude for drawing, especially horses and dogs, attracting the attention of a Mr Phillips, for whom he painted watercolour portraits of his horses. At thirteen Cooper went to work for his uncle, William Davis, manager of Astley's circus, famous for its spectacular equestrian dramas, providing the boy with opportunities to study horses at first hand. However, he refused an equestrian role with John Kemble at Covent Garden about 1809, and from this year determined to become an artist. About this time, wishing to have a portrait of a horse he had often ridden, Cooper bought a small book on oil painting and set about the task himself. The horse's owner, Henry Meux, seeing the finished picture, <span class="italic">Frolic</span>, was so delighted with it that he insisted on buying it for his own collection. William Davis knew the celebrated horse painter Benjamin Marshall. The generous Marshall, appreciating Cooper's talent, addiction to hard work, and personal charm, freely gave him studio space, encouragement, and instruction, and introduced him to prospective patrons. Cooper also studied and copied illustrations in the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span> and became a contributor in 1811 with a portrait of a pointer, <span class="italic">Basto</span>, described as a very staunch young dog. During his lifetime Cooper provided 189 subjects which were engraved in the magazine. He exhibited first in 1812 at both the Royal Academy and the British Institution. Initially his subjects were horses, dogs, and some wild animals, but from 1815 he started showing meticulously researched battle paintings, often of the civil war, usually including mounted soldiers. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1817, and it was said that his painting shown in 1820, <span class="italic">The Battle of Marston Moor</span>, led to his election as Royal Academician that year. Becoming an academician within seven or eight years of taking up oil painting was a remarkable achievement. Between 1812 and 1868&#150;9 Cooper exhibited 332 pictures at the Royal Academy (and seventy-three at the British Institution). Although only a quarter of these paintings were battle scenes, he was acknowledged as the country's principal battle painter, with a similar standing to Peter Hess in Germany and Horace Vernet in France. A slightly plaintive correspondent of the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> wrote that &#145;Between the years 1828 and 1831 the artist seems to have been so much occupied with painting portraits of famous racers, hunters, and roadsters, as to leave no time for pictures of a more important character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1863, 90). With changes of taste, the twentieth-century public largely forgot his battle pictures, but his many racehorse portraits, perhaps lacking some of the vibrancy of those by his mentor Marshall, came into vogue as well as providing a valuable and accurate record for turf historians. Two of his most famous racehorse portraits, both exhibited at the Royal Academy, were the winners of the St Leger in 1836 and 1837. Lord George Bentinck's Elis with John Day up and the trainer John Doe with his hack was followed by Mango, the property of Bentinck's great rival Charles Greville, clerk to the privy council. Cooper's conversation piece <span class="italic">The Day Family</span>, exhibited in 1838, shows the artist as a master of portraiture, both human and equine, and composition in placing the six figures of the celebrated racehorse trainer and his family, two horses, and a mule carriage in a natural grouping. This painting was bequeathed by Sir Abe Bailey to the National Gallery of South Africa. A very similar version, also dated 1838, is in the Tate collection. Cooper was particularly adept at catching the character of Arab horses and <span class="italic">Adonis</span>, his portrait of George III's favourite charger which had been imported from Hanover to improve the royal stud, is a perceptive study of this attractive breed. He painted coursing and shooting scenes, but the hunting field only on rare occasions. He also gave lessons to J. F. Herring (1795&#150;1865) and to William Barraud (1810&#150;1850), and his son, Alexander Davis Cooper (<i>fl</i>. 1837&#150;1888), must have benefited from his father's advice in his genre painting and illustrations of scenes from Shakespeare. Abraham Cooper lived throughout his life in or near London, dying at his home, Woodbine Cottage, Woodland Street, Greenwich, on 24 December 1868. He was buried in Highgate cemetery. His obituary in the <span class="italic">New Sporting Magazine</span> remembers him as &#145;a guileless pleasant gentleman with little jealousy in his nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Sporting Magazine</span>, 100), which probably accounted for his personal effects being valued for his widow, Frances, at less than &pound;200.<br>
