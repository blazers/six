<span class="headword">Harcourt, Sir  Cecil Halliday Jepson</span>  (1892&#150;1959), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 11 April 1892 at Maitland Lodge, London Road, Bromley, Kent, the son of Halliday Harcourt, solicitor, and his wife, Grace Lilian, daughter of Dr Jepson. He was educated at Fonthill, East Grinstead, and from 1904 to 1909 at the Royal Naval College at Osborne and Dartmouth. On passing out from Dartmouth, as midshipman in 1909, he was awarded the term first prize in mathematics. By 1913 he was a lieutenant. He might have considered an alternative career as he was on the retired list in 1915, but in May 1916 he returned to the active list. He served on the battleship <i>Centurion</i> in the Grand Fleet and was present at the battle of Jutland.<br>
<br>Between the wars Harcourt served with the Atlantic, home, Mediterranean, and reserve fleets in destroyers and mine-sweepers. He was promoted commander in 1926 and captain in 1933. Following staff courses Harcourt was seconded to the Royal Australian Navy as captain (D) in 1935&#150;7. These seagoing and command experiences provided a sound professional background to his appointment in 1938 as deputy director of the Admiralty's operations division. He remained with the operations division until 1941, becoming director in 1939. Thus he was in a crucial staff post at the start of the Second World War, and his contribution to the effective operational use of the navy was recognized by appointment as a CBE in 1940 and command of the modern battleship <i>Duke of York</i>. Winston Churchill was his passenger in December 1941 and January 1942 for two transatlantic journeys to meet President Roosevelt.<br>
<br>On promotion to rear-admiral in July 1942 Harcourt began a two-year period of service in the Mediterranean as flag officer of force Q, which comprised a cruiser squadron, destroyers, and other attached ships, such as monitors, as needed. While its main task was to give naval gunfire support to allied landings, it also carried out attacks on axis supply convoys. Force Q was part of the supporting force for the operation Torch landings in Morocco and Algeria. Harcourt's personal command contribution was recognized by the Americans by appointment to the Legion of Merit in November 1942. The citation for the award stated that &#145;His unfaltering support in the face of heavy odds did much to make possible the success of that operation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Dec 1959). After operation Torch, force Q operated from the vulnerable Algerian port of B&ocirc;ne, harassing axis supply convoys between December 1942 and spring 1943. Harcourt's immediate superior, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, recognized the risks to Harcourt and force Q but knew that their role was critical and signalled Harcourt that he must &#145;stick it out&#146; as allied support was coming to the area. For these services Harcourt was appointed CB in 1943. From June to September force Q was in regular action in support of the allied landings at Pantelleria, Lampedusa, and Limosa; in June operation Husky supported the Sicily landings and in September 1943 operation Avalanche, the Salerno landings. Harcourt was mentioned in dispatches for his contribution to the Salerno landings.<br>
<br>Harcourt returned to the Admiralty from February 1944 to summer 1945 as naval secretary to Cunningham, now first sea lord. He was then appointed to the Pacific Fleet as flag officer 11th aircraft-carrier squadron and then, with his carriers plus three cruisers, four destroyers, a submarine, and mine-sweeping flotillas, he commanded task group 111.2 for the reoccupation of Hong Kong in September 1945. A small number of Japanese suicide motor boats were observed near Hong Kong and Harcourt ordered his carriers' planes to destroy them. Pressure from Chaing Kai-shek meant that Harcourt had to receive the surrender of Major-General Okada and Vice-Admiral Fujita on behalf of both the British and Chinese governments. From September 1945 to June 1946 Harcourt was the <i>de facto</i> governor of Hong Kong as commander-in-chief and head of the military administration. He was a sensitive administrator, and was called by the Chinese name Ha Kok, a reference to a distinguished fourth-century Chinese nobleman Chung Kok. He was knighted in 1945 (KCB), was promoted vice-admiral in 1946, and awarded the grand cordon of the Chinese order of the Cloud and Banner.<br>
<br>After Hong Kong, Harcourt was appointed flag officer (Air) and second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet. In March 1948 he returned to the Admiralty as second sea lord with responsibility for all personnel and manpower issues. This was an onerous post because government economies required overall manpower reductions in the navy from 178,000 to 147,000 and maintaining even the reduced level by re-engagements was difficult because of the attractions of civilian occupations. The rate of re-engagements had fallen from 61 per cent in 1938 to 22 per cent in 1948. Harcourt was to warn in 1949 of a &#145;first class breakdown&#146;  (Grove, 45) in two years if the shortage of key ratings was not rectified. While second sea lord Harcourt received his final promotion to admiral in June 1949. From 1950 to 1952, when he retired, he was commander-in-chief, Nore command, and he was advanced to GBE in 1953. He was also admitted to the Norwegian order of St Olav in 1951 and the Danish order of Dannebrog in 1952.<br>
<br>In retirement, living in Eaton Place, London, Harcourt played leading roles in the London and Greater London Playing Fields Association, the Royal Commonwealth Society, and the Victoria League. He had married first, in 1920, the noted concert pianist Evelyn Suart, daughter of Brigadier-General W. H. Suart CMG and widow of Gerald Gould. After her death in 1950 he married Stella Janet Waghorn, the widow of Air Commodore D. J. Waghorn; she survived him. There were no children of either marriage. Harcourt died <i>en route</i> for St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, London, on 19 December 1959, aged sixty-seven. A memorial service was held in January 1960 at St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
