<span class="headword">Thornton,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1641, <em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">hydrographer</span>, was baptized at St Botolph, Aldgate, London, on 8 October 1641, the second of seven children of John Thornton, cutler and razor maker, and his wife, Ann Gomer. The family lived on Tower Hill and later East Smithfield, the road to Ratcliff which had long been a centre of chart making. In 1656 Thornton was apprenticed to John Burston of Ratcliff Highway, a leading chart maker and freeman of the Drapers' Company. There he learned the skills of manuscript chart making developed in England over the previous hundred years and passed down from master to pupil by members of the Drapers' Company.<br>
<br>Having married Ann Boult on 23 June 1664, Thornton completed his apprenticeship and became a freeman of the company on 11 January 1665. His earliest surviving signed chart, dated 1667, shows the east coast of England and is a typical &#145;platt&#146; of the time, drawn on vellum and mounted on two hinged wooden panels for protection. Thornton was by now working on his own account from premises in East Smithfield and the following year took on two apprentices. Soon after this he moved to the Minories, where he remained for the rest of his career, working principally &#145;at the Sign of England, Scotland, and Ireland&#146;.<br>
<br>Some forty manuscript charts with Thornton's name are known, dated between 1667 and 1701, showing European, American, Mediterranean, and eastern waters. They include large oceanic charts on four panels but the majority are pilot charts of smaller areas drawn in his later years. Most of these larger scale charts are for navigation in eastern seas and were at first drawn from traditional Dutch sources, but they gradually incorporated material from East India Company voyages and reflected English interests in the area. By 1673 Thornton had extended his activities into printed map and chart publishing, and may well have mastered engraver's skills himself. Charts of the Strait of Magellan by Sir John Narborough and Hudson's Strait were followed by numerous other printed works, including the first map of Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Thornton's contemporary John Seller conceived the idea of the first English printed maritime atlas and published the first two volumes of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> in 1671 and 1672. In 1677 Thornton joined a partnership which took over the project from Seller and played an important part in the subsequent history of the work and its companion volume, the <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus</span>. Thornton contributed charts to the Mediterranean volume published by the partnership in 1677 and in 1689 was responsible, with a partner, William Fisher, for <span class="italic">The English Pilot: the Fourth Book</span>, covering the Atlantic coasts of North America and the Caribbean. In 1703 he was the sole compiler and publisher of <span class="italic">The Third Book</span>, the first English seaman's guide for the route to the East. Many of its thirty-five charts were engraved versions of charts he had previously been producing in manuscript form. The volume was dedicated to the directors of the East India Company and produced with their encouragement. Thornton described himself as &#145;Hydrographer to the Company&#146; and also to the Hudson's Bay Company, although there is no evidence of official appointment to either office.<br>
<br>Thornton's charts, both manuscript and engraved, were distinguished by a bold clear style, and attention to improvement by frequent correction, unusual for the time. His working life straddled the transition of the fast-expanding English chart trade from manuscript to printed charts and he was unique in playing a leading role in both fields. His major contributions to three of the five volumes of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> were used by English seamen almost unaltered for over half a century after his death.<br>
<br>Thornton died early in 1708 and was buried on 23 January at St Botolph, Aldgate. His wife had predeceased him, as had their daughter Sarah and possibly a second wife, Ann Greenleafe, whom he may have married at St Katharine by the Tower on 31 March 1694. By his will, drawn up on 12 March 1707, Thornton left substantial bequests to his daughter Ann, Sarah's six children, and his sons, Macabees and Samuel. <a name="cosubject_50903"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Thornton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1665&#150;1715)<span class="occ"></span> also inherited his father's business with his stock of charts, copper plates, and instruments. He had not been formally apprenticed to his father but had worked with him and learnt his trade. Only one manuscript chart with Samuel Thornton's name is known, of the entrance to Canton (Guangzhou), 1707, but he almost certainly drew at least one chart which bears his father's name and made an important contribution to his father's later work. On John Thornton's death Samuel became a freeman of the Drapers' Company by patrimony and continued to publish many of his father's printed charts, including a revised edition of <span class="italic">The English Pilot, Third Book</span> in 1711. Samuel Thornton died in September or October 1715 and most of the Thornton chart plates passed to the firm of Mount and Page.<br>
