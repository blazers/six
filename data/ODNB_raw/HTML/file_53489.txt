<span class="headword">Grubb <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pim]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (1746&#150;1832), <span class="occ">miller and benefactor</span>, was born on 11 December 1746 at Mountrath, Queen's county, the eldest of the fifteen children of John Pim (1718&#150;1797), a rich Dublin wool merchant, and his wife, Sarah Clibborn (1724&#150;1812) of Moate Castle, co. Westmeath; she was related through both parents to most of the prominent Quaker families in Ireland. Educated by her mother, she grew up in Dublin and Ballitore, co. Kildare, where she formed lasting friendships with the schoolmaster Richard Shackleton and his daughter Deborah. She moved to Middlesex with her family in 1771 and settled at a house called Tanner's End, Tottenham, where she mixed in fashionable Quaker society in and around London, describing her experiences to Deborah Shackleton with characteristic openness and liveliness. The English Quakers, she noted, loved finery whereas the Irish retained the &#145;plain&#146; dress but entertained lavishly. Throughout her life she kept up a wide correspondence.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1778 Sarah married John Grubb (1737&#150;1784), a flour miller of Anner Mills, Clonmel, co. Tipperary, the second son of Joseph Grubb (1709&#150;1782) and his wife, Sarah Greer (1717&#150;1788), and thus she entered the circle of wealthy Quaker families who controlled Clonmel's milling industry in its golden age. Although some in this circle lived &#145;like princes of the earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of William Savery</span>, 267), the Grubbs chose to live plainly and their comfortable home, Anner Mills, for years provided hospitality to numerous travelling Quaker ministers, ranging from Catherine Phillips and William Savery, to Thomas Shillitoe and Elizabeth Fry. This extremely happy marriage ended prematurely with John Grubb's death from overwork in 1784.<br>
<br>Sarah chose to take her husband's place and run the mills herself, with the support of her brother Joshua, a prominent Dublin banker. She entrusted her five small daughters to Sarah Lynes (later Grubb), who came from London in 1787 and later became a leading Quaker travelling minister. Her sister Elizabeth Pim took over the Anner Mills household. Sarah Grubb found that business, and contact with the country people, raised her spirits. The mills had ten pairs of stones and three water wheels, and with David Malcomson as her first manager, followed by John Barclay Clibborn (a cousin who married her daughter Elizabeth) she was independently successful as &#145;Sarah Grubb, Miller and Corn Dealer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Directory of Clonmel</span>, 1787). This success was largely due to her strict integrity, and a policy of always using cash when buying in, and selling at low rates rather than giving credit.<br>
<br>Possessed of great clearness of mind and a powerful character, Sarah Grubb was also a person of warm human sympathy and benevolence. She did what she could to alleviate widespread local misery caused by poverty and drunkenness, and she was quick to send aid to those afflicted by the 1798 rising. She was a great encourager of the education of the young, and a supporter of Quaker building projects, helping to fund Newtown School, Waterford (established 1798), and Garryroan meeting-house, co. Tipperary (1789). Further afield she supported the fight against slavery and helped German refugees in London. The combination of success in business and social beneficence won her the nickname the Queen of the South.<br>
<br>Her spiritual life was characterized by thanksgiving and a desire to come close to God, and &#145;her countenance often strikingly indicated the near access and sweet communion she was favoured to enjoy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Monitor</span>, 1834, 27). As an elder for over forty years, she strongly maintained the old Quaker testimonies, lovingly admonishing young and old alike, be it for playing music or straying into unorthodoxy.<br>
<br>Sarah Grubb's business acumen and philanthropic instincts resurfaced in at least two of her grandchildren, John Grubb Richardson (1813&#150;1890) who in 1845 used Anner Mills money to build the model industrial village of Bessbrook, co. Armagh, and Lydia Goodbody (1810&#150;1886), active in the pioneering jute industry at Clara, King's county.<br>
<br>Sarah Grubb considered herself &#145;over bulky&#146; in appearance  (Sarah Grubb to Eliza Greer, August 1785, MS, Dublin Friends' Historical Library), she enjoyed a green old age, and was described by Joseph John Gurney in 1827 as &#145;a veteran of the good cause, strong in her intellectual and lively in her spiritual faculties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Gurney</span>, 1.350). She was lampooned by Sarah D. Greer in <span class="italic">Quakerism, or, The Story of my Life</span> (first published in London in 1851, and published in Dublin in 1852) as Sarah Mills, a clever, wilful and dominating woman; however, the attack was part of a general attempt to defame Quakerism, and is probably unrepresentative of her character. She died, leaving a fortune estimated at over &pound;100,000, at her home, Anner Mills, on 31 October 1832, and her body was interred on 2 November in the Quaker burial-ground at Clonmel.<br>
