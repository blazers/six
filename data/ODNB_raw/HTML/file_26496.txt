<span class="headword">Stewart,  Matthew</span>, eleventh or second earl of Lennox  (<em>d.</em> 1513), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26485/', "John Stewart, the tenth or first earl of Lennox (d. 1495)")</script>, and Margaret Montgomery, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19051/', "Alexander Montgomery, first Lord Montgomery (d. 1470)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54294/', "Montgomery family")</script>]. His younger brother was the soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26503/', "Robert Stewart (c.1470&#150;1544)")</script>. He was of age by 1484, when he first attended parliament. Prominently associated with the rebellion of 1488 against James III, after the king's death at Sauchieburn (11 June) Stewart received joint keepership with his father of Dumbarton Castle on 20 October 1488 and extensive powers to pursue criminals in the Lennox. The patronage, however, seems to have been too slowly granted, and did not include a role on the new king's Hepburn-dominated council.<br>
<br>This appears to have been why Stewart, his father, and Robert, Lord Lyle, raised a rebellion in the Lennox in April 1489 against their allies of the previous year. All three were forfeited by parliament in June and arrangements were made for the siege of the rebel strongholds of Crookston, Duchal, and Dumbarton. The first two fell quickly, but the last was a much more difficult target. Stewart and Lyle were in charge of Dumbarton and, despite a rebel defeat at Gartloaning, near Aberfoyle, on 11 October, they held out until mid-December, when the king's forces admitted defeat, after massive expenditure on men, munitions, and ships. The siege of Dumbarton proved the decisive element in what was effectively a rebel victory, and over the next months many of the rebel demands were met. Parliament was called to negotiate a settlement in February 1490, the forfeitures of June 1489 were annulled, and the king's council was broadened beyond the narrow Hepburn clique.<br>
<br>Stewart himself was not closely associated with the council in the 1490s, but was employed in letting crown lands. His father resigned the formal ownership of the Lennox and Darnley estates (though not the titles and tenancy) to him on 1 June 1490. On his father's death, between 31 August and 11 September 1495, he became earl of Lennox, and also sheriff of Dumbarton and keeper of Rothesay Castle on Bute (a post he held until <i>c</i>.1501).<br>
<br>After gaining the earldom, Lennox grew increasingly close to James IV. He is found as a card-playing companion of the king, as an exchequer auditor, and as a royal justiciar (1503). He worked especially in Kintyre and Knapdale, where he was appointed king's lieutenant on 11 May 1499. He was a regular witness of royal charters and a member of the council after 1501: from 1503 he attended some 90 per cent of council meetings. No great rewards came his way, but in January 1512 his main estates were freed of inheritance dues and wardship, he was confirmed in hereditary possession of the whole of the old earldom of Lennox (to which there had been other claimants), and the sheriffdom of Dumbarton (presumably including the castle) was amalgamated with the earldom. In 1513 he probably escorted French troops, guns, and equipment, which had been landed in Dumbarton, to the royal army that invaded England, and he was killed at Flodden on 9 September. He may have contracted, by 13 June 1480, to marry Margaret, daughter of Robert, second Lord Lyle. That marriage, however, either did not take place or was annulled; a grant of lands to Margaret on 15 April 1494, just six days after Lennox contracted to marry Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1530), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12078/', "James Hamilton, first Lord Hamilton (d. 1479)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54222/', "Hamilton family (per. 1295&#150;1479)")</script>], suggests that she was bought off. Lennox and Elizabeth had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26487/', "John Stewart (d. 1526)")</script>, who succeeded.<br>
