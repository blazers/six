<span class="headword">Colman <span class="st"> [Coleman]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1636&#150;1678), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 17 May 1636 at Brent Eleigh, Suffolk, the second of five children and only son of Thomas Colman (<i>d</i>. 1661), vicar of Brent Eleigh and later rector of Thorpe Morieux, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1680), daughter of Philip Wilson of Bocking, Essex. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 16 October 1651, and graduated BA in 1656 and MA in 1659. He entered royal service as a gentleman pensioner to the king on 28 June 1661. At some point between 1664 and 1667 he married his first cousin, Mary Orme (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1640, <i>d</i>. after 1678), daughter of his late aunt, Jane Colman, and her husband, Simon Orme of Goldhanger, Essex. This marriage probably produced no children.<br>
<br>Colman converted to Roman Catholicism in the early 1660s, and few advocates of the Catholic cause in late seventeenth-century England were as charismatic as he. Several highly publicized conversions were credited to his influence, and it can even be speculated that he may have played some part in that of James, duke of York (later James II). York's belief that the Catholic church would make headway in England only by supporting a policy of religious toleration echoed Colman's own views. What is certain is that he was associated with York by the early 1670s (probably, in the first instance, because his cousin Richard Colman, MP for Salisbury, was related to the Hydes, York's kin by marriage), and in 1673 York appointed him as secretary to his second wife, Mary of Modena.<br>
<br>During the mid-1670s Colman conducted what was arguably an independent foreign policy on behalf of the duke of York. A visit by him to Cardinal Falconieri in Brussels in spring 1674 was an unsuccessful attempt to make indirect contact with the papal court. He was more persistent in cultivating several members of the French court, most notably the king's confessors, Jean Ferrier and Fran&ccedil;ois de la Chaise. However, it would appear that none of those in France with whom he corresponded thought the matter of sufficient importance to require the attention of Louis XIV. The exact extent of York's knowledge of these negotiations was never established: he knew a great deal about what Colman was up to and he was probably less than truthful when he later claimed that he had &#145;oft forwarn'd him [Colman] to be careful how he carryd himself, not to be so busy and meddlesome&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of James the Second</span>, 1.533&#150;4). Their principal aim throughout was to obtain subsidies to reduce Charles II's dependence on parliament at a time when further legislation against Catholics seemed likely. No money was forthcoming and, when a French subsidy was eventually secured, it was through the efforts of the king and his own advisers. The lord treasurer, Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby, and the bishop of London, Henry Compton, came to view Colman as a dangerous influence on York and so plotted to remove him. They succeeded in getting him dismissed as the duchess's secretary in late 1676 after he was caught leaking naval intelligence in a newsletter. His activities thereafter on behalf of York are more shadowy, but he did receive substantial sums of money from Barrillon, the French ambassador, which he may have disbursed as bribes to MPs.<br>
<br>As one of the most prominent lay Catholics in York's circle, it was unsurprising that Colman should figure in the elaborate fantasy plot dreamed up by Titus Oates and his associates in autumn 1678. According to Oates, Colman was to become secretary of state once the murder of Charles II had paved the way for York's accession. This detail may have been added by Oates only when he expanded on his original claims at his second meeting with Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey on 28 September. It later emerged that Godfrey got in touch with Colman immediately after that meeting, presumably so that York could be warned of the extent of Oates's new allegations. On 29 September 1678, the day after Oates was questioned by the privy council, officials raided Colman's house on the south side of Dean's Yard, Westminster. The search failed to find him, but did uncover a hidden cache of letters documenting his secret negotiations. The following day Colman, who may not have realized that the letters had been discovered, gave himself up and appeared before the privy council. His decision to come forward impressed the council and, at that stage, they were inclined to believe him. Their mood changed as soon as the decoding of the letters began. Taken out of context, much of what they contained could be interpreted as evidence of a Catholic plot, and there was a strong case for saying that the notorious letter of 29 September 1675 to de la Chaise did violate the anti-Catholic statutes then in force.<br>
<br>Colman stood trial for treason in king's bench on 27 November, by which time Godfrey's murder had reinforced Oates's apparent credibility. Colman's conduct in court was considered &#145;very temperate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 4.481), and he was sharp enough to expose several factual errors in Oates's evidence. The jury took less than a quarter of an hour to reach their guilty verdict. The death sentence was carried out at Tyburn on 3 December 1678, with Colman holding out to the very end the hope that York would obtain a last minute pardon for him. After he had been hanged, drawn, and quartered, his body was buried on unconsecrated ground next to St Giles-in-the-Fields. His wife, who survived him, is believed to have committed suicide several years later. Colman was beatified as one of the English martyrs by Pope Pius XI in 1929.<br>
