<span class="headword">Pond, Sir  Desmond Arthur</span>  (1919&#150;1986), <span class="occ">psychiatrist and physician</span>, was born on 2 September 1919 in Catford, London, the only child of Thomas Arthur Pond, electrical engineer and company director, and his wife, Ada Celia Clutten. He was educated at John Lyon School in Harrow, at St Olave's in south-east London, and at Clare College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he obtained a first class in both part one of the natural sciences tripos (1940) and part two of the moral sciences tripos (1941). He gained a Rockefeller studentship to Duke University, North Carolina (1942&#150;4), and followed this with clinical studies at University College Hospital medical school, London, and thus qualified in medicine in both the United States and Britain (MB BChir, 1945; diploma in psychological medicine, 1947). He proceeded to a Cambridge MD in 1951 and to fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1960. By then he had trained in psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital, specializing, though not exclusively, in child psychiatry.<br>
<br>British psychiatry, guided by Aubrey Lewis, flourished during the post-war years. Psychiatrists began to occupy important positions in medical affairs and councils. Others besides Pond contributed to this, but his personal effectiveness and standing placed him at the forefront. Psychiatrists respected him as a leading psychiatrist, and physicians recognized him as a physician. He was helped by his particular speciality of epilepsy in children and its cerebral, psychiatric, and psychological causes and sequelae. In the eyes of the medical profession epilepsy was &#145;real medicine&#146;. In 1961 he gave the Goulstonian lecture to the Royal College of Physicians of London, a rare honour for a psychiatrist, on the psychiatric aspects of epileptic and brain-damaged children. His comprehensive approach to the epilepsies of childhood carefully balanced the respective importance of social, clinical, epidemiological, and electroencephalographic findings. Psychiatry was securing a larger place in medical education, and as a consultant at University College Hospital from 1952 to 1966, and later when occupying the foundation chair of psychiatry at the London Hospital medical college (1966&#150;82), Pond raised both the clinical and academic status of the subject.<br>
<br>From 1978 to 1981 Pond was president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, of which he had become a founder fellow in 1971. Previously he had served on its important committees and particularly furthered training in psychiatry for general practitioners. During his presidency he was chosen by fellow medical presidents to chair the Conference of Royal Medical Colleges, the first psychiatrist to do so. He thus became the spokesman on general matters for all the colleges. He was a member of the Medical Research Council (1968&#150;72 and 1982&#150;5) and from 1982 to 1985 chief scientist at the Department of Health, where he helped to develop the relationship between the department and the Medical Research Council to the benefit of medical science generally.<br>
<br>A deeply religious man, more humanitarian than pietistic, he was a founder member of the Institute of Religion and Medicine in 1964. He served on the archbishop of Canterbury's group on divorce law reform from 1964 to 1966, which published <span class="italic">Putting Asunder</span>, and he helped set up the Richmond Fellowship, which provided residential homes with a marked but skilfully concealed spiritual background for psychiatric patients, wherein a long period of caring stability assisted in rehabilitating mentally disturbed young people.<br>
<br>Pond was a visiting professor to the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1968 and at Western Reserve Institute, Pittsburgh, in 1971. He served on a number of committees concerned with epilepsy, including the welfare and rehabilitation of epileptic subjects. These included committees of the World Health Organization, which adopted his classification of childhood epilepsies. He lectured widely and published upon his own subject and own research, and upon medical matters generally. <span class="italic">Counselling in Religion and Psychiatry</span> (1973) was based on his Riddell memorial lecture delivered in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1971. He was made an honorary fellow of the British Psychological Society in 1980 and of the Royal College of General Practitioners in 1981. He was knighted in 1981.<br>
<br>His build was slight. Personable, popular, and kind, with his ideas always well organized, Pond never seemed in a hurry but there was an underlying firmness which ensured that others usually agreed with his proposals. He chiefly acted by encouragement, especially as a teacher. With colleagues, juniors, and students his emphasis was always on bringing out rather than stuffing in: &#145;I don't mind spoon-feeding students but I draw the line at moving their jaws up and down as well&#146;. He had a great love of music and was a gifted pianist. In 1945 he married (Margaret) Helen, herself a physician, daughter of Louis Arnold Jordan, research scientist. It was a long and happy marriage, and they had three daughters, two of whom became professional musicians. He and his wife retired to the Teign valley in Devon. Pond died from cancer, after a long and painful illness, on 29 June 1986 in Torquay Hospital.<br>
