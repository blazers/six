<span class="headword">Hobhouse, Sir  Charles Edward Henry</span>, fourth baronet  (1862&#150;1941), <span class="occ">politician and diarist</span>, was born on 30 June 1862 at Dormansland, near Lingfield, Surrey, the only son and third of six children of Sir Charles Parry Hobhouse, third baronet (1825&#150;1916), Wiltshire landowner and former judge in the high court of Calcutta, and his wife, Edith Lucy, daughter of Sir Thomas Turton, second baronet, of Felcourt. His mother died in 1867 and his father soon remarried, having a further son and four daughters. Hobhouse was educated at Eton College (1875&#150;9) and at Christ Church, Oxford (1880&#150;81), and seemed destined for a military career, attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1884. He was diverted into politics both by his upbringing in a Liberal tradition and by his marriage on 24 April 1890 to Georgina Fleetwood (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of George Pargiter Fuller, of Neston Park, a neighbouring squire and Liberal MP.<br>
<br>In 1892 Hobhouse narrowly won Wiltshire East for the Liberals against a formidable Conservative opponent. In the ensuing parliament he served as a private secretary at the Colonial Office. The Liberal set-back in 1895 cost him his seat, and his chronic hay fever directed him to an urban constituency. He won East Bristol in 1900 and retained it in the general elections of 1906 and 1910.<br>
<br>The Liberals returned to office in 1905, and in 1907 Hobhouse became under-secretary of state for India. He headed a royal commission into decentralization whose report influenced subsequent Indian legislation. In April 1908 he became financial secretary to the Treasury, and in October 1911 gained a place in the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. His career reached its peak in February 1914 when he became postmaster-general, an office then involved in the early developments of wireless telegraphy and the controversies concerning rival telegraphic systems. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1916.<br>
<br>Hobhouse commanded confidence as a hard-working administrator and straightforward spokesman for his department. He did not make a great impact beyond his own office, nor was he in sympathy with some trends in Liberal affairs. He stood by traditional causes, such as free trade and Irish home rule, but he believed that David Lloyd George, as chancellor of the exchequer, should restrain spending and not encourage it. He deplored Sir Winston Churchill's big-navy policy, and he opposed quite provocatively the campaign for women's suffrage.<br>
<br>The First World War ended Hobhouse's career. He lost office when the first coalition was formed in May 1915, suffered discredit by opposing, and then capitulating to, the campaign for military conscription and, as a supporter of H. H. Asquith (later first earl of Oxford and Asquith), was crushed in the 1918 election by a Lloyd George Liberal and a Labour candidate. (He even suffered the indignity of losing his deposit, a provision but recently instituted to discourage &#145;freak&#146; candidates.) Hobhouse remained active in Liberal affairs after 1918. Only as the party faded did he turn his attention from politics to his estates.<br>
<br>Hobhouse began keeping a diary during his round-the-world honeymoon in 1893, and continued to do so for five years. He returned to the practice in 1904 and did not cease until he lost office in 1915. These documents are of particular interest for a succession of dramatic episodes. Notwithstanding personal predilections and occasional misunderstanding of events, his diaries provide incisive sketches of key individuals and insights into the course of events. Their value is enhanced by the fact that at the time no official records were kept of cabinet meetings (apart from the prime minister's low-key letter to the king), and few diaries by leading politicians have survived from this period. Extracts from Hobhouse's diaries were published in 1977.<br>
<br>Of medium height and strong build, Hobhouse (despite his hay fever) was much given to outdoor activities, undertaking long expeditions on his bicycle and riding to hounds with a recklessness that sometimes resulted in personal injury. His first wife died in 1927. On 18 June 1931 he married Aim&eacute;e Gladys (<i>d</i>. 1965), widow of Benjamin Adams Brendon, of the Indian Civil Service, and daughter of David Charles Ballinger Griffith, of Huntworth, Bedford. Both marriages were childless. Hobhouse died at his home, Monkton Farleigh Manor, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, on 26 June 1941. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his half-brother, Reginald Arthur (1878&#150;1947).<br>
