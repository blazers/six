<span class="headword">Gibson,  Walter</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1645, <em>d.</em> in or after 1717), <span class="occ">merchant and shipowner</span>, was the eldest son of John Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1679), portioner of Newtoun (otherwise Overton or Overnewtoun), Lanarkshire. Walter Gibson's brothers John, Andrew, and Ninian were merchants, while another brother, James, was a ship's captain and agent in Amsterdam for the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies during the first Darien expedition of 1698. He captained the <i>Rising Sun</i> on the second expedition of 1699 but after its failure in 1700 he perished with the ship during a hurricane off the coast of Charles Town. Walter Gibson became a merchant burgess and guild brother of Glasgow on 26 December 1670 as son-in-law of William Robertson (<i>d</i>. in or before 1670), merchant burgess, whose daughter Jonet (Janet) he had married. With the agreement of James VII and nomination of John Paterson, archbishop of Glasgow, he was &#145;elected&#146; provost of Glasgow in January 1688, and in December that year was continued provost by royal instruction.<br>
<br>Gibson began as a malt maker but in the 1680s entered the more lucrative overseas trade. His interests were, at first, in herring, and he chartered Dutch ships to export fish to France, returning with wine, brandy, and salt. In addition, in April 1688, he acquired from the Royal Society of Fishing the valuable ten-year tack for duty charged on exported white fish and herring. He pioneered the smoking of red herrings in his smokeries at Gourock, his herrings being termed &#145;Glasgow magistrates&#146;. By the late 1680s he had acquired three ships of his own and was also trading with Spain and Norway. He was also &#145;the first that brought [from Sweden] iron to Glasgow&#146;  (McUre, 207).<br>
<br>Gibson's involvement in Atlantic trade with Virginia and the West Indies was more dramatic and he joined other Glasgow merchants in evading the English navigation acts. In 1687 a cargo of sugar from the plantations was impounded for payment of customs as it appeared to be on a foreign ship. However, Gibson explained to the lords of exchequer that the false name <i>St Christopher</i> had been given to his own vessel, &#145;such a name being necessary, for other wayes all Scots shipps that trade to the plantations are confiscable&#146;  (NA Scot., warrants of exchequer, E 8.40). He encouraged the Darien scheme but provided investment through his vessels and his brother, not as a subscriber to the Company of Scotland. In 1681 Gibson, having volunteered, was commissioned by the privy council to transport banished criminals and covenanters to America, and in 1684 transported at profit over thirty prisoners from the tolbooths of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He seems, however, to have been a religious pragmatist rather than an anti-covenanter, and counted presbyterians such as Henry Erskine, Lord Cardross, among his company and transported the emigrant Cardross to Carolina. None the less, Gibson's ambiguous religious position probably accounts for his removal as provost after the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>Gibson and his wife had had several sons. He owned extensive property in and around Glasgow including the lands of Ballshagrie, Clayslopp, Whytinch, Hyndland, Partick, the fishings of Kelvin water, and the coalheughs of Camlauchie. Although apparently remaining wealthy, he was a prisoner in Glasgow tolbooth in 1708 after a dispute, dating back to 1695, over a debt of 5000 merks he owed to the burgh. Commercially combative, this has echoes of his bitter dispute with London merchants in 1690. Gibson's testament has not survived, and his date of death and place of burial are unknown, though he was alive in January 1717.<br>
