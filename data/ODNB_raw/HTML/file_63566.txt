<span class="headword">Palmer,  William</span>  (1740&#150;1816), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and diplomatist</span>, was the son of Samuel Palmer of Holborn Yard, London, and his wife, Frances. He joined the British army, serving in the West Indies where in St Kitts in 1761 he married Sarah Hazell. In 1765 he left the army for the East India Company service, being posted to Bengal as a cadet. In 1774 he became aide-de-camp to the governor-general, Warren Hastings, who made him his military secretary in 1776. Hastings came to have great confidence in Palmer's ability to act as his agent with Indian rulers, and Palmer in return became a devoted admirer of the governor-general. As he put it, &#145;I love, I revere Mr Hastings&#146;  (Palmer to D. Anderson, 12 Feb 1782, BL, Add. MS 45427, fol. 86). Hastings sent him on missions to the court of the wazir of Oudh at Lucknow.<br>
<br>When Hastings left India in 1785 Palmer's career became more chequered. He spent ten years (1787&#150;97) as the company's agent with the Maratha leader Sindhia, and in 1798 took up his most important diplomatic post, as resident at Poona with the peshwa, the titular head of the Maratha confederacy. He despised the peshwa's politics but refused to deviate from a policy of &#145;argument, persuasion and conciliation&#146; with him  (Palmer to W. Hastings, 10 July 1801, BL, Add. MS 29178, fol. 63), which he knew was unacceptable to the forceful governor-general, the Marquess Wellesley, who recalled Palmer from Poona in 1801.<br>
<br>Palmer's wife had borne three sons, Samuel (1762&#150;1814), William George (1764&#150;1814), and <a href="#cosubject_63565">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and two daughters, before he went to India. She remained at home, never to see her husband again, but after their schooling the boys were sent to join their father in India, where he had started a new family with a Muslim lady of distinguished lineage, Faizh Baksh (<i>d</i>. 1828), granted the title of begam in 1796. In his will Palmer was to describe her as &#145;my affectionate friend and companion during a period of more than 35 years&#146;  (BL OIOC, L/AG/34/29/28). With Faizh Baksh he had four illegitimate sons, <a href="#cosubject_63566">William [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Hastings (1785&#150;1860), Charles and John (both born in 1791), and two daughters, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1783) and Frances (<i>b</i>. 1792). Palmer and the begam and three of the children were strikingly depicted by Johan Zoffany in a group portrait of 1785. Palmer seems to have made no distinction between his legitimate and his illegitimate children, sending the sons to be educated in Britain.<br>
<br>The Poona residency was the last of Palmer's diplomatic postings. He stayed in India in the army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general by the time of his death at Berhampore in Bengal on 20 May 1816. He was buried at Berhampore.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63565"></a><span class="headword">John Palmer</span>  (1767&#150;1836), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Britain on 8 October 1767, just before his father left for India. He joined the navy, fighting in Indian waters in the American War of Independence. In 1784 he went to Bengal and was employed in one of the new private concerns called agency houses. With the decline of the East India Company's commercial activities, these businesses enjoyed a spectacular if febrile prosperity, managing funds entrusted to them by British and Indian clients and investing them in shipping and new export crops, above all in indigo. Palmer entered the house of Burgh and Barber, becoming a partner in 1793. In 1803 he became a partner in the well-established business of Cockerell, Trail, which was known as Palmer &amp; Co. from 1810. For nearly twenty years the Palmer house was to hold a dominant position in the Calcutta business world.<br>
<br>In the years of his prosperity John Palmer had an honoured place in Calcutta society. He married Mary, daughter of Colonel Samuel Hampton, in 1791; they had five sons and seven daughters. As befitted a man dubbed &#145;the prince of merchants&#146;, he lived in a great house, where he dispensed extravagant hospitality and a range of charitable giving which contemporaries feared went beyond even his extensive means. He was public-spirited and liberal in his opinions, supporting the freedom of the press and the rights of people of mixed race as well as forming close friendships with Indian businessmen.<br>
<br>In the late 1820s the house of Palmer was beset with difficulties that were to force it into insolvency on 4 January 1830, inflicting losses on a large body of investors and starting the slide that was to drag down the rest of the great agency houses. Palmer later reflected that his &#145;Hopes of Utility and Distinction&#146; had &#145;seduced me into Gigantic Engagements, I wanted moral, phisical [<i>sic</i>] and financial Force to sustain&#146;  (J. Palmer to M. Palmer, 5 April 1833, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. d 107, fol. 52). In particular, the house was over-committed to indigo on a falling market. Palmer resumed a limited agency business in 1833, dying of &#145;quinzy&#146; on 21 January 1836. &#145;The Friend of the Poor&#146; was inscribed on his tomb in North Park Street cemetery, Calcutta.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63566"></a><span class="headword">William Palmer</span>  (1780&#150;1867), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was John Palmer's half-brother. He was born in Calcutta, and baptized there on 20 March 1780. Although as a person of mixed race he was officially classified as a &#145;native of India&#146;, he insisted that his &#145;feelings, his education, his habits, his descent from his father are all peculiarly English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorial of William Palmer</span>, 32). He sought his fortune in Hyderabad, the largest of all the nominally independent Indian states tied to the East India Company by treaty. In the early nineteenth century, states where the British exercised influence without formal control were happy hunting grounds for enterprising individuals. In 1799 William Palmer became an officer in the nizam's army, fought in several campaigns, and was ultimately granted the rank of brigadier. In 1810 he established a trading and banking business. To meet his commitments, including heavy obligations to the British, the nizam was obliged to borrow extensively. With the encouragement of his half-brother John in Calcutta, William Palmer's company advanced money to the nizam, sometimes at 25 per cent or more, in return for assignments on the Hyderabad revenues. To protect these transactions Palmer made the resident at Hyderabad a beneficiary of them, and even succeeded in involving the governor-general, the marquess of Hastings, through making a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his a partner. In 1820, however, a new resident, Charles Metcalfe, began a campaign to reform the nizam's government, which, in his view, required an end to William Palmer's profiteering and to his influence at Hyderabad.<br>
<br>The Palmer Company's outstanding loans were paid off by the East India Company, but interest was reduced and various claims were disallowed. As a result the business was declared bankrupt in 1824. Some money was recovered through pressure on the nizam's government and this, together with a pension from the nizam, enabled William Palmer to continue to live in Hyderabad in some prosperity. He had a number of children, apparently by more than one Muslim lady, most of the sons being commissioned into the company's army. One of his sons-in-law described him as having &#145;a fascination about him quite irresistible to me, his knowledge was so varied, classical, historical and political&#146;  (Taylor, 1.97). Even Metcalfe paid tribute to his amiability. In 1848 he married Hester Desormeaux (1811&#150;1877), widow of a surgeon at Hyderabad, who supported him in the &#145;difficulties and distress&#146; that afflicted his old age  (Crofton, 18&#150;19). He died on 20 May 1867 at Hyderabad, where he had lived for some seventy years, and was buried in St George's cemetery, Chandraghat, Hyderabad.<br>
