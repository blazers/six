<span class="headword">Master,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1587/8), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was a younger son of Robert Master (<i>d</i>. before 1551) of Street End, near Canterbury, Kent. A fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, from 1533 to 1541, Richard Master graduated BA in 1533 and MA in 1537. Later he would claim that he became a protestant at about this date through reading the works of Heinrich Bullinger, and that he gave up a lucrative benefice <i>c</i>.1538&#150;9 because he considered himself unsuitable for the post, and &#145;Popery, though officially abolished flourished in reality&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 1.177). Master certainly met Bullinger's associate, Rudolph Gwalther, on 11 March 1537 during his visit to England and subsequently corresponded with him. Master's enthusiasm for the protestant cause was tempered by a native shrewdness: he suspended the correspondence with Gwalther during the reign of Mary.<br>
<br>Master began studying medicine about 1541. In 1545 he was admitted BM at Oxford University with licence to practice. From 1547 he studied at Christ Church and graduated DM on 29 July 1555, despite suffering severe illness through much of 1549 and 1550. Master's medical standing rose steadily throughout the 1550s. In March 1553 he became a fellow of the College of Physicians. He was censor of the college in 1556&#150;8 and 1560, and elect in 1558. He was also incorporated MD at Cambridge in 1571.<br>
<br>Master's appointment for life as royal physician on 26 June 1559 represented the zenith of his career. Other preferment soon followed. In 1561 he was elected president of the College of Physicians. In 1563 he was granted the lucrative prebend of Fridaythorpe in the East Riding of Yorkshire and lands in Sheriff Hutton near York. He was appointed master of the hospital of St Mary the Virgin, Newcastle upon Tyne, and consiliarius of the College of Physicians in 1564. In September 1566 he was moderator of the physic act kept there before the queen at Oxford. In 1568 Elizabeth I granted him a coat of arms. In the same year he was granted the reversion of the site of the former abbey of Cirencester in return for &pound;590, where, after buying out the sitting tenants, he built a substantial house. Further grants of property in Huntingdonshire, Sussex, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, and Essex occurred in 1577 and 1581. His standing is also indicated by his being chosen as dedicatee of a translation of a French tract on gout by Christopher Arbaleste in 1577. Master's good relationship with the queen is suggested by his exchange of gifts with her on new year's day of 1562, 1578, and 1588, one of which was almost certainly a fine silver covered cup bearing the badge of Anne Boleyn, the queen's mother  (&#145;Reports of the itinerary&#146;, 32). Master had married Elizabeth, daughter of John Fulnetby of Fulnetby near Wragby, Lincolnshire, by 1560; they had seven sons.<br>
<br>Richard Master made his will on 10 January 1587; he was buried on 15 January 1588 at St Olave, Silver Street, London. He was survived by his wife, who received the lease estate, income from Bisley Wood in Gloucestershire, and two thirds of the marriage settlement of their eldest son George. George inherited the Cirencester house and estates in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. Master set aside &pound;310 for the purchase of Sinckley Manor, Gloucestershire, for his son John. Henry received his father's house in Silver Street, St Olave, London, and his father's &#145;books of phisick and books of philosophie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/72, sig. 34). His other sons received annuities. Four of Master's sons had distinguished careers. George, of St John's College, Oxford, and Lincoln's Inn, was MP for Cirencester in 1586 and 1588. Thomas (1560&#150;1628), BTh, master of the Temple in 1601, became canon of Lichfield in 1613 and archdeacon of Shropshire in 1614. Robert (1565&#150;1625), DCL, was principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford, 1599&#150;1603, chancellor of Rochester and Lichfield, and MP for Cricklade in 1601. Henry, MA, was principal of St Alban Hall 1603&#150;14.<br>
<br>In addition to some of his correspondence with Rudolph Gwalther, a number of other letters by Richard Master survive. These include his undated reply to Elizabeth I concerning her question about the general causes of disease  (Strype, 4.271) and several letters to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, which give advice concerning loose teeth, gout, and pains in the head and neck (TNA: PRO, SP 12/141/33; BL, Lansdowne MS 46.38, 121.19).<br>
