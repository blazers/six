<span class="headword">Fortescue,  Hugh</span>, second Earl Fortescue  (1783&#150;1861), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 February 1783 at the Army Pay Office, Whitehall, the eldest son of Hugh Fortescue, third Baron and first Earl Fortescue (1753&#150;1841), and his wife, Hester (1760&#150;1847), daughter of the statesman George Grenville. He had two brothers and six sisters. When his father, one of the largest landowners in Devon, received an earldom from Pitt in 1789, Fortescue took the courtesy title of Lord Ebrington, by which name he was known for most of his career. He was educated at Eton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford. He was returned to parliament for Barnstaple in 1804, and acted with the &#145;new&#146; opposition to Pitt led by his uncle, Lord Grenville [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11501/', "Grenville, William Wyndham, Baron Grenville")</script>], whose own administration he supported. He was re-elected for Barnstaple in 1806, but defeated there as an opponent of the Portland ministry in 1807. Another uncle, the first marquess of Buckingham, returned him for St Mawes in July; but two years later he took a half-pay army commission, vacated his seat, and went to follow the Peninsular campaign.<br>
<br>In 1812 Ebrington re-entered parliament&#151;again thanks to his uncle&#151;as MP for Buckingham. He was an evangelical in religion and in his maiden speech, on 27 June 1814, he supported a call for suppression of the slave trade. He had two audiences at Elba with Bonaparte (whom he admired) in December of that year (<span class="italic">Memorandum of Two Conversations</span>, 1823). Already disenchanted with the Grenvillites' conservatism, he deplored the renewal of war, and in 1816 began to vote with the advanced wing of the whigs. He vacated Buckingham to contest Devon in May, and was defeated; but he was returned again for Buckingham through his cousin, the second marquess of Buckingham. Ebrington's final, though amicable, political break from his relatives occurred in 1817, when he opposed the suspension of habeas corpus and voted for parliamentary reform before surrendering his seat.<br>
<br>Ebrington headed the poll for Devon in 1818, was beaten in 1820 and in 1826, but won a spectacular victory in 1830. He had meanwhile been accommodated at Tavistock by the influence of the sixth duke of Bedford. He was unopposed in Devon in 1831, as he was in its northern division in 1832, 1835, and 1837. In the 1820s he attained an influential position in the whig party as one of its younger generation of noblemen who actively promoted a liberal agenda, including parliamentary reform, in an attempt to wrest the initiative from the radicals. He had no office in the Grey ministry, but played a prominent part in rallying support for it in the reform crises of October 1831 and May 1832. Ebrington, who provided a valuable link between the aristocratic and country strands of whiggism, subsequently mustered back-bench support for the appropriation of surplus Irish church revenues, thereby helping to commit the party to practical reform while remaining undefiled by radicalism. Le Marchant wrote of him in 1833: &#145;He is not a man of powerful mind or extensive information, but he is integrity personified, and all his views are liberal and enlightened&#146;  (Aspinall, 366). In 1839 Ebrington was summoned to the Lords in his father's barony and appointed viceroy of Ireland, where he remained until the fall of the Melbourne government in 1841, shortly after he succeeded as second Earl Fortescue. Partly to publicize free-trade doctrines, he published in 1844 <span class="italic">A Selection from the Speeches and Writings</span> of his brother-in-law, the seventh Lord King. A promoter of public health and educational reform, Fortescue was lord steward of the household in Russell's ministry, from 1846 to 1850.<br>
<br>Ebrington was twice married: first, on 4 July 1817, to Lady Susan Ryder (1796&#150;1827), daughter of the first earl of Harrowby; they had three sons, including the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33212/', "Hugh Fortescue")</script>, before her premature death. His second marriage, on 26 July 1841, was to Elizabeth, widow of Sir Marcus Somerville, and daughter of Piers Geale of Clonsilla, co. Dublin; they had no children. Fortescue, who was lord lieutenant of Devon from 1839 and was made a KG in 1856, died at Exeter on 14 September 1861. His widow died in 1896, aged ninety-one.<br>
