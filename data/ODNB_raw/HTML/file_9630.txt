<div class="para">
<span class="headword">FitzRoy,  Charles</span>, first Baron Southampton  (1737&#150;1797), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 25 June 1737, the third, but second surviving, son of Lord Augustus FitzRoy (<i>d</i>. 1741) and his wife, Elizabeth Cosby, the daughter of Colonel William Cosby, governor of New York (1732&#150;6). Descended from Henry FitzRoy, an illegitimate son of Charles II, he was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9628/', "Augustus Henry FitzRoy, third duke of Grafton")</script>. On 27 July 1758 he married Anne Warren (<i>d</i>. 1807), the daughter of Admiral Sir Peter Warren MP and Susanna de Lancy. They had sixteen children, their second son, Charles, being incorrectly rumoured to be an illegitimate son of George III. Lord of the manor of Tottenham Court, FitzRoy and his family lived at FitzRoy Farm, near Highgate, Middlesex, which he inherited from his mother in 1768.<br>
<br>Little is known of FitzRoy's early life. In 1752 he was commissioned an ensign in the 1st foot guards and, on account of family influence, enjoyed rapid promotion; by 1758 he was a lieutenant-colonel and by 1762 a colonel of the 119th foot. During the Seven Years' War he served in Germany as an aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, from 1759 to 1762. At the battle of Minden, on 1 August 1759, he carried a dispatch from Prince Ferdinand to Lord George Sackville (later Germain) to advance the British cavalry. Sackville's slowness in so doing resulted, at his own insistence, in a court martial in which FitzRoy gave evidence. It concluded in Sackville's disgrace in March 1760. Appointed a groom of the bedchamber in 1760, FitzRoy was present at the battle of Vellinghausen in July 1761, before returning to London in 1762.<br>
<br>While in Germany, FitzRoy had been elected in August 1759 as MP for Orford, Suffolk, thanks to the influence of the duke of Newcastle, who also secured a secret-service pension for him in December 1759. Re-elected to parliament as MP for Bury St Edmunds in 1761, he at first followed the political lead of his elder brother. He refused to follow the duke of Newcastle into opposition in May 1762, but was none the less dismissed from his court sinecure by Lord Bute for voting against the peace preliminaries in December 1762. He spoke against the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in April 1765, and acted as Grafton's political agent in the negotiations with William Pitt regarding the formation of a new administration in May 1765. With his brother back in office, FitzRoy served as colonel of the 14th dragoons (1765&#150;72) and was promoted major-general in 1772 and lieutenant-general in 1773; he was also vice-chamberlain to Queen Charlotte (1768&#150;82). When his relationship with Grafton became strained after 1769, FitzRoy refused an appointment as vice-chamberlain to George III in 1770 and, as the member for Thetford, Norfolk (1774&#150;80), he increasingly went his own way. His refusal to follow Grafton into opposition over Lord North's coercive policy towards America, in October 1775, was rewarded by his creation as Baron Southampton on 17 October 1780, and the court sinecure as groom of the stole to the prince of Wales in December 1780.<br>
<br>In the Lords, FitzRoy moved the loyal address to the throne in 1781, and on 18 February 1782, when Lord Carmarthen moved a motion protesting against Lord George Germain's elevation to the peerage as Lord Sackville of Drayton, on the grounds that the verdict of the Minden court martial should disqualify him, FitzRoy intervened in the debate to counter Germain's implication that the court martial had been conducted for political reasons. He addressed the Lords on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in February 1789 without committing himself to either side, and was advanced to the rank of general in 1793. He died at his home in Stanhope Street, London, on 21 March 1797 and was buried in St James's burial-ground, Hampstead Road, on 30 March. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George, also an army officer. His widow died on 13 July 1807 at FitzRoy Farm.<br>
