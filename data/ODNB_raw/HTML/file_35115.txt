<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morris,  Michael</span>, first Baron Killanin  (1827&#150;1901), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Spiddal, co. Galway, Ireland, on 14 November 1827, the eldest son of Martin Morris JP (1784&#150;1862) and Julia Blake, the daughter of Dr Charles Blake of Galway. His father was the first Catholic since 1690 to hold the office of high sheriff of Galway. His mother died of cholera in 1837, and his younger brother, George (1833&#150;1912), grew up to be high sheriff of Galway (1860&#150;61), MP for Galway City (1867&#150;8 and 1874&#150;80), and a member of the Irish Local Government Board (1880&#150;98), and was knighted in 1898. Morris was educated at Erasmus Smith School in Galway, and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he matriculated as an exhibitioner on 2 July 1842. As a Roman Catholic he was disqualified from competing for a scholarship, but in 1846 or 1847 he graduated as first senior moderator in ethics and logic and won a gold medal. As well as working hard as an undergraduate, he developed a passion for tennis.<br>
<br>Morris entered as a student of Lincoln's Inn, London, on 3 May 1847. After a year's foreign travel he was called to the Irish bar, in Trinity term 1849, and joined the Connaught circuit. He rose quickly in his profession and, like his father, became high sheriff of Galway (1849&#150;50). From 1857 to 1865 he held the post of recorder of Galway, and in February 1863 he took silk. On 18 September 1860 he married Anna Hughes (<i>d</i>. 17 Oct 1906); they had four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>Such was Morris's popularity in Galway that although he identified himself with no political party and gave no electioneering address he was returned as MP for Galway in July 1865 with 90 per cent of the vote. Once in the House of Commons he sat with the Conservative Party since, though he was scornful of party ideologies, he was mistrustful of any further widening of the franchise and was opposed to home rule for Ireland, being firmly unionist in his sympathies. In July 1866 he was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland by Lord Derby, being the first Roman Catholic to hold that office under a Conservative administration. He was re-elected unopposed by his constituents. In November 1866 he was promoted to the attorney-generalship; also in 1866 he was sworn of the Irish privy council, where his knowledge of local politics helped him to undertake useful judicial work.<br>
<br>In 1867 Morris was raised to the Irish bench as puisne judge of the court of common pleas, being succeeded in Galway by his brother George. He became chief of his court in 1876, and lord chief justice of Ireland in 1887. He was said to have managed juries with an appealing bonhomie and, even at the height of the emotive land league agitation (1880&#150;83), to have been measured and just in his judgments.<br>
<br>Morris was created a baronet on 14 September 1885, and on 25 November 1889 he was promoted to the judicial committee of the English privy council; he received a life peerage on 5 December 1889 as Baron Morris of Spiddal. Although his new duties forced him to move to London, his permanent residence and interests remained in Ireland. As appellate judge of the privy council his good humour again helped him to retain his popularity. He often dissented from the majority of the committee, but held his own in argument with his colleagues. His best-known judgment was that delivered in <i>McLeod v. St Aubyn</i> (1899), a case dealing with contempt of court. Although both an Irishman and a Catholic, Morris was well liked in English society and he integrated easily. He became a member of Grillion's Club, and in 1890 he received the unprecedented honour of being elected a bencher of Lincoln's Inn, though he had never been called to the English bar.<br>
<br>Morris took a keen interest in the topical question of Irish education. From 1868 to 1870 he was a member of the royal commission on Irish primary education; in 1868 he became a commissioner of national education, and later he was chairman of the board. On the foundation of the Royal University in 1880 he was appointed a senator, and in 1899 he was elected vice-chancellor. He was a visitor of Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1887 received the honorary degree of LLD from his old university.<br>
<br>Morris retired from the privy council in 1900, when he accepted the hereditary barony of Killanin in the peerage of the United Kingdom; he became known as Lord Morris and Killanin. He died at Spiddal on 8 September 1901. His wife, two sons, and five daughters survived him, and he was succeeded in the barony of Killanin by his eldest son, Martin Henry Fitzpatrick, who had been elected as a Conservative MP for Galway in 1900 despite the opposition of &#145;home rulers&#146; and with his father's considerable help.<br>
<br>Morris's judicial decisions were of a kind which often warmed the public, being concerned with the spirit rather than the letter of the law, scorning precedent and being without pretence to legal erudition. His popularity with middle-class Irish opinion, and with his loyal Galway tenantry, was unrivalled. Although implacably opposed to the nationalist dream of an independent Ireland, his ability to make jests in Irish, and to be immune from the charge of racism or anti-Catholic feeling, helped to make his position more palatable and to keep him from being hated personally. Even during attempted Fenian insurrections and the Land League movement, he never received a threatening letter, and he used to joke that Ireland's troubles could be blamed on a wet climate and a lack of coal. He also agreed with the nationalists that financial relations between Ireland and England were unjust, speaking up for Ireland in the House of Lords on 23 March 1894. He detested developments which laid further financial burdens on Irish tenants, and he could be caustic on the subject of English ineptitude in the governing of Ireland. It was he who came up with the neat epigram, quoted by Randolph Churchill in the debate on home rule of 17 April 1893, that Ireland was &#145;a quick-witted nation &hellip; being governed against its will by a stupid people&#146;  (Lucy, 108).<br>
