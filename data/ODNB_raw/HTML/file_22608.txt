<span class="headword">Potter,  Christopher</span>  (<em>c.</em>1751&#150;1817), <span class="occ">ceramic manufacturer and contractor</span>, was probably the son of George Potter of Bethnal Green, London. He was the owner in 1777 of the estate of New Barns, near Ely, Cambridgeshire, devoted to the culture of woad. At first his property was cultivated by itinerant woadmen, but afterwards by his own agricultural labourers&#151;in his view, an innovation. He also manufactured orchel dyes at Bethnal Green. During the American War of Independence he was one of the principal victualling contractors for the British army. In 1780 he unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary representation of Cambridge. In 1781 he was returned for Colchester, but on petition was unseated for corrupt practices. In 1784 he was again returned, but was again unseated, on the grounds of having been declared bankrupt, and of possessing no property qualification. On a new writ being issued he was candidate for a third time, but was defeated. His candidature seems to have led to the passing of the act disqualifying government contractors.<br>
<br>Potter settled in Paris, where in 1789 he established potteries, including the Manufacture du prince de Galles, in the rue de Crussol; he may also have been involved in potteries at Forges-les-Eaux and Montereau. He assumed or received credit for the invention of printing on porcelain and glass, though this had been practised at Worcester and Liverpool as early as 1756&#150;7. Backed by the Academy of Sciences and by Jean Sylvain Bailly, the mayor of Paris, in 1791 he petitioned the national assembly for a seven years' patent, promising to give a quarter of the profits to the poor, and to teach his process to French apprentices. No action was taken on his petition, but he enjoyed for years a virtual monopoly. In 1792 Potter reopened the Chantilly potteries, closed through the emigration of the Cond&eacute; family at the beginning of the French Revolution. Here he employed 500 men and reputedly produced 9000 dozen plates a month, for which he is said to have earned &pound;6000 a year  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span>, 1818, vol. 2, p. 352). In 1793, when the English in France were arrested as hostages in response to the British support for the royalist uprising at Toulon, he was imprisoned at Beauvais and Chantilly. In 1796 he was the bearer to Lord Malmesbury at Paris of an offer from Jean-Nicolas-Paul-Fran&ccedil;ois de Barras to conclude peace for a bribe of 500,000 livres.<br>
<br>At the industrial exhibition of 1798 on the Champ de Mars, the first held in Paris, Potter was awarded one of twelve chief prizes for white pottery&#151;the composition, shape, and varnish being highly commended. In 1802 he was one of twenty-five gold medallists who dined with Bonaparte. Very few specimens of his ware survive, but at the Mus&eacute;e National de la C&eacute;ramique, S&egrave;vres, there is a cup, ornamented with designs of flowers and butterflies, which bears his initials, surmounted by prince of Wales's feathers.<br>
<br>In 1811 Potter advocated the culture of woad in France, citing his Cambridgeshire experience, and between 1794 and 1812 he took out five patents for agricultural and manufacturing processes, some of them in association with his son, Thomas Mille Potter. (No details of a marriage have been established.) By all accounts Potter appears to have been an agreeable man. Lord North described him in 1778 as &#145;a gentleman of business and of very fair character in the City &hellip; a good friend to Government upon all occasions&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 3.309). William Cole, the Cambridge antiquary, noted in 1780 that he was a man &#145;eloquent to a great degree, of a most captivating conversation and behaviour&#146;  (ibid.). He died, apparently in London, on 18 November 1817. His obituary described him as a person &#145;whose opportunities and abilities should have fixed him at the summit of wealth&#146;, but who was &#145;too eccentric and speculative to hoard a fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
