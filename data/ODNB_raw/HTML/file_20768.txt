<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Daniel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1612&#150;1664), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Con MacNiall MacBrian Faghartach O'Neill (<i>d</i>. 1619), lord of Clandeboye in co. Antrim, and his wife, Eilis, the daughter of Art MacBaron O'Neill, the older, base-born brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20775/', "Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone")</script>. Born at the ancestral seat of his father's family at Castlereagh, co. Down, Daniel's life was charted by the political dexterity of his grandfather Niall MacBrian O'Neill and the intemperance of his father. The former owed his position to the crown's favour, which was threatened by the native ascendancy of Tyrone and the upheavals of the Nine Years' War. Playing off the fortunes of the conflict, Niall MacBrian, shortly before his death in February 1601, resecured his estates under the queen. His son Con wasted this recognition by going over to Tyrone's side before the battle of Kinsale. Captured and imprisoned after his &#145;perfidious revolt&#146;  (Chichester to Cecil, 8 Oct 1601, <span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 110&#150;11), Con escaped the government's wrath, but squandered his reprieve by inciting trouble over a petty disagreement with local authorities. Reconfined, he made a bargain with Hugh Montgomery, afterwards viscount of the Ards, for a royal pardon in return for half of his holdings. Recognizing an opportunity for advancement, James Hamilton, later Viscount Claneboye, persuaded the king to reward his service by including him in the Montgomery settlement. On 5 November 1605 the tripartite grant was passed by letters patent under the great seal of Ireland. Over the next fourteen years, until his death in 1619, Con O'Neill sold, mortgaged, and leased his remaining holdings. His eldest son and heir, Daniel, inherited little of an estate once valued at about &pound;12,000 a year.<h2>
<a name="Anaspiringcareer"></a>An aspiring career</h2>The prospects for Con O'Neill's surviving family were not encouraging. One son, Hugh Buidhe, died as a youngster, while another, Con, pursued a career in the Spanish Netherlands as an officer in the Irish regiment of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20783/', "Owen Roe O'Neill")</script>. A daughter, Catherine, married her cousin Thady O'Hara of Crebilly, co. Antrim, and had five children. It was Daniel O'Neill who carried the burden of restoring what his father had dissipated. The government, recognizing the importance of this native Irish heir, made him a ward of chancery and raised him in England as a protestant. This background and the circumstances of his upbringing produced a striving and resourceful young man. Quick-witted and charming by nature, Daniel was described by Clarendon as &#145;in subtlety and understanding much superior to the whole nation of the old Irish&#146;, a &#145;great observer and discerner of man's natures and humours, and &hellip; very dextrous in compliance where he found it useful&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.513).<br>
<br>As the recognized head of the Upper Clandeboye O'Neills, much of Daniel O'Neill's status and initial well-being revolved around the fate of his father's forsaken estates. In an inquisition delivered into chancery in June 1624, he and his assigns held only twenty-seven townlands about Castlereagh. By 1635 these lands were conveyed by the king to Viscount Montgomery of the Ards. This decision left O'Neill and his brother with a joint annuity of &pound;160. Without immediate prospects in his homeland, O'Neill entered his majority by serving under Lord Conway in the Low Countries. Here he gained military experience and prominent friends. Until the late 1630s O'Neill divided his time between the English court and the states general&#151;&#145;the winter seasons in the one and the summer always in the army of the other; which was as good an education towards advancement in the world as that age knew&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.513). On the continent he became well acquainted with Elizabeth, the titular queen of Bohemia and sister of Charles I, and her husband, the elector palatine. Using these connections, in 1635 he redoubled his efforts to regain parts of his father's former estates. These undertakings coloured his politics and ambitions for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>O'Neill's petitions were supported by such noteworthies as Archbishop Laud, Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, Charles Lewis, the new elector palatine, and Lord Conway, all of whom addressed the Irish lord deputy, Thomas Wentworth, on O'Neill's behalf. Arundel recommended him for master of the Irish mint and Laud urged Wentworth &#145;to help him to a subsistence&#146; and restore to &#145;this gentleman that [which] is lost without his own fault&#146;  (Laud to Wentworth, 16 Jan 1636, <span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 7.266&#150;7). O'Neill was also armed with addresses from the king. But his suit never had the lord deputy's support. Wentworth's inactivity was personal. He did not appreciate O'Neill's importunity or the persistent pressures from a well-connected supplicant with, his own protestantism notwithstanding, strong Irish Catholic associations. Wentworth saw O'Neill as a desperate suitor seeking leverage from any opportune source. He was especially troubled by his close relationship with his influential cousin Randal MacDonnell, second earl of Antrim. The lord deputy distrusted Antrim, grandson of the late earl of Tyrone, and his ambitions in north-east Ulster and the western isles of Scotland. In particular, Wentworth had misgivings over Antrim's appointment of O'Neill to a royal commission in Scotland. He was wary of arming either man and described O'Neill &#145;to be in his Heart and affection a Traytor, bred no other, Egg and Bird as they say&#146;  (Wentworth to Windebank, 2 March 1639, <span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 7.297). This estrangement set O'Neill against the lord deputy, which prejudiced him with the king.<h2>
<a name="Precivilwarplotting"></a>Pre-civil war plotting</h2>Waiting for his claims to be sorted out, O'Neill returned to the Low Countries in 1637 and participated in the siege of Breda. He distinguished himself and was severely wounded in the primary assault. Following his recovery, he found himself caught up in the campaigns of the erupting bishops' wars with Scotland. He was given command of a troop of horse, &#145;having had good experience in the most active armies of that time, and courage very notorious&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.513). After the treaty of Berwick he retired to the Netherlands with dispatches for the queen of Bohemia. When hostilities renewed, he went back to command a regiment of horse and distinguished himself with his gallant defence at Newburn (28 August 1640), where he was badly wounded and captured. Reported to be dead, he was taken to Newcastle, where he was well treated by captors he knew from the continent. He was released during the Ripon negotiations.<br>
<br>Over the next two years O'Neill took advantage of the evolving crisis between the crown and parliament to enhance his options. He conspired for the overthrow of Thomas Wentworth, now the earl of Strafford, and participated in a series of plots representing a variety of royalist interests. Two of these schemes, the army plots (March&#150;May 1641), were linked to deploying the support of the northern English army officers for the king. For his services, the debt-ridden O'Neill got a royal annuity and the promise of an appointment as groom to the royal bedchamber. These intrigues were followed by a shrouded conspiracy involving his brother Con, an agent from his uncle Colonel Owen Roe O'Neill, to northern Irish Catholic malcontents. Con's initial mission, when he met up with Daniel, was to get recruiting licences for soldiers in Strafford's soon to be disbanded Irish army. Hoping to capitalize on Daniel's royalist connections, Con believed he could get the king's desperate assent to put these soldiers under beholden Catholic commanders. In what is sometimes called the &#145;colonels' plot&#146;, Con moved between England and the continent trying to co-ordinate plans through his older and well-connected sibling. In the coded correspondence that ensued, Daniel O'Neill was termed Lewis Lanois. This machination was derailed in mid-June when O'Neill fled to the continent to escape parliament's attempt to arrest him for his role in the original army plots.<br>
<br>When he was questioned about his complicity, there was initially insufficient evidence to convict O'Neill. It was only after incriminating testimony surfaced that he fled to the continent. In September, hoping for immunity under a negotiated act of oblivion, he returned to England and surrendered to John Pym. O'Neill was sent to the Gatehouse prison in Westminster to await his trial, declining to respond to the initial indictment. But new revelations about the second plot saw the charges changed to high treason. While he was in custody, his health began to suffer and he successfully petitioned in January 1642 for better treatment. He was moved to the Tower and afforded greater personal liberty. On 5 May he escaped by tying sheets and a tablecloth together. He went over the wall and avoided detection by dressing as a woman. Searches were ordered with descriptions of him &#145;being of sanguine complection, a middle stature, light brown hair, about the age of thirty, and little or no beard, and of late hath been sickly&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 5.48). His flight gained considerable notoriety in a provocative tract detailing his breakout. It confirmed him &#145;a consanguinean to that rebellious family [O'Neills] in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oneales Escape out of the Tower of London</span>). This association seemed appropriate after the outbreak in October 1641 of the Irish rising.<h2>
<a name="Anagentofthecrown"></a>An agent of the crown</h2>The upheaval in Ireland stoked the deteriorating English political crisis which brought an Irish royalist like Daniel O'Neill to the forefront. From Brussels, where he had fled, he raised arms and ammunition for the anticipated royalist campaigns of the civil war. Back in England he became a major in Colonel Osborne's regiment before taking a commission as a lieutenant-colonel of a regiment of horse under Prince Rupert of the Rhine. He participated in the battles of Edgehill, Chalgrove, and the first Newbury encounter, and was wounded at the failed relief of Reading. Soon after, he learned that his brother Con had been killed in Ireland after quarter had been granted at the skirmish of Clones. But, grief aside, most of O'Neill's attention was given to serving at the royal court in Oxford, where he could have &#145;access to all those of the best credit in this state of the world&#146;  (Trevor to Ormond, 9 Dec 1643, T. Carte, <span class="italic">A Collection of Original Letters and Papers, Concerning the Affairs of England</span>, 1.26). Through his former services and connections he appeared to be the right person to help the crown deflect parliament's alliance with the covenanting Scots.<br>
<br>The royalist camp knew that a military diversion in Scotland was necessary to obstruct the new accord. In a scheme similar to that suggested by Antrim during Strafford's deputyship, it was hoped that Scottish royalists supported by Irish soldiers would foil the king's enemies. The plan called for Antrim to raise 10,000 troops in northern Ireland to serve under the earl of Montrose in Scotland. Unfortunately, Antrim lacked credibility and was not on good terms with the marquess of Ormond, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, who had just signed a cessation of arms with the ruling Irish Catholic confederacy. To facilitate these negotiations, Lord Digby proposed his good friend the well-trusted Daniel O'Neill. Getting him appointed, Digby had to overcome the king's wariness about Daniel's role in Strafford's overthrow. He also extracted O'Neill's long-promised appointment to be a groom to the royal bedchamber. Digby advised Charles that this post gave O'Neill stature as an emissary. He then mollified his majesty by suggesting that having an Irishman so near &#145;to the person of the king&#146; would not be a factor, since O'Neill would be taken up with services elsewhere  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.513&#150;21).<br>
<br>O'Neill and Antrim arrived on 23 February 1644 at the confederate capital of Kilkenny and addressed the supreme council, urging that their support would help the confederate peace commissioners get favourable terms from the king. From here O'Neill met Ormond in Dublin, before proceeding with Antrim to Ulster. By the end of June, 1600 soldiers were raised and shipped to Scotland for service in Montrose's army. Departing soon after, O'Neill returned to England too late to join his regiment at the battle of Marston Moor. He did participate in the western campaigns against Essex's forces and took part in the second battle of Newbury. But his value was his royalism and his ties to his uncle Owen Roe, the native military leader and protector of the clerical party.<br>
<br>For most of the next five years O'Neill's primary tasks were to secure aid from the native Irish and bring his uncle over to the king's side. These dealings were frustrating and often futile because he could not offset the suspicions of the papal nuncio Rinuccini and his faction. At stake were religious and landed guarantees that were often neither negotiable nor enforceable. With Owen Roe and Ormond difficult and contrary bargainers, O'Neill's efforts faltered in the kaleidoscopic arena of confederate politics. By 1647 he spoke of quitting his homeland and entering the French service. Digby persuaded him to reconsider, despite their disappointment over Ormond's surrender of Dublin to parliament. Another set-back was the opposition of the clerical party to O'Neill's appointment to be general of the confederacy's Connaught army. With failing prospects, he accompanied Digby to France, where he again was caught up in a variety of enterprises involving the recruitment of Irish soldiers. Not until October 1648 did he return to Ireland with Ormond to resume his royalist representations.<br>
<br>Daniel O'Neill reopened talks with Owen Roe, but the terms of the treaty did not satisfy Rinuccini and the clergy. When the nuncio left Ireland in February 1649, O'Neill again failed to secure a pact because the intentions and good faith of Ormond's party were still suspect. The treaty's urgency was soon redoubled by the changing military climate of Ireland. Parliamentarian forces had defeated Ormond at Rathmines (2 August 1649), Oliver Cromwell had landed in Dublin (15 August 1649), and truces with Owen Roe proved fruitless. The gravity of these events weighed heavily on O'Neill, who busily tried to revive talks with his terminally ill uncle. On 20 October a peace accord was finally reached between Owen Roe O'Neill and Ormond, and seventeen days later General O'Neill died.<br>
<br>Following the settlement, O'Neill accompanied his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20776/', "Major-General Hugh Dubh O'Neill")</script> and 2200 men south to try to repel Cromwell's forces. Too late to be effective, O'Neill got some satisfaction when the new English king Charles II appointed him to the Irish privy council. But the important selection for O'Neill was the contest over who would succeed Owen Roe as the commander of the northern army. Ormond and his supporters favoured O'Neill's election. Unfortunately, the clerical party led by the bishop of Clogher resisted his candidacy. O'Neill pleaded ill health and proposed Hugh Dubh to lead his uncle's army. He also accused the clergy of looking &#145;more to their reputations at Rome than their preservation at home&#146;  (D. O'Neill to Ormond, 9 Jan 1649&#150;50, Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 26, fol. 332). After a great deal of scheming, Clogher prevailed by suggesting that if elected he would turn the command over to Daniel O'Neill on the inconceivable condition of his conversion to Catholicism. Three months later the bishop-led army was decimated at the battle of Scariffhollis. Having no other recourse, O'Neill got the permission of Henry Ireton to enlist 5000 men for the service of Spain or the states general, and returned to the continent.<h2>
<a name="Royalistexile"></a>Royalist exile</h2>For the next decade Daniel O'Neill's attention was focused on survival. Firmly attached to the fortunes of the exiled court, he risked his life on many occasions for the Stuart cause. He gathered intelligence about conditions in England, reconciled royalist factions, carried dispatches, and acted as a commissariat to Charles and his court. Some of his most important tasks were mediations between the Sealed Knot and Action parties over the ill-fated royalist insurrections in England. But O'Neill and his fellow &eacute;migr&eacute;s suffered for their devotion. They were often debt-ridden and sometimes lived from hand to mouth. Looking for maintenance, O'Neill even offered to raise 3000 soldiers for Spain in return for the position of colonel-general of all Irish in the Spanish service. His proposal rejected, he depended on his position as groom to the royal bedchamber and his ties to Lord Heenvliet and his wife, who cared for Charles II's sister, Princess Mary of Orange. He used his influence at the Dutch court to favour friends such as Ormond and Edward Hyde, who once addressed O'Neill as the &#145;Infallible Subtle&#146;  (Hyde to O'Neill, 31 Oct 1653, Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 46, fol. 361). In one instance O'Neill recommended Hyde's daughter Anne to be a lady-in-waiting to the princess, putting her on a course to become a future duchess of York.<h2>
<a name="Restorationandreward"></a>Restoration and reward</h2>With the restoration of the Stuarts on 29 May 1660, O'Neill's devotion and friendship were well rewarded by an appreciative monarch. He never received a peerage, but he accumulated money-making positions and sinecures to make him one of the richest men in England. He held numerous lucrative land grants in London and Ireland and built Belsize House in Hampstead. Having married in September 1660 Heenvliet's widow, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wotton (<i>d</i>. 1667), who had been created countess of Chesterfield as widow of her first husband, Henry Stanhope, in May of that year, he enjoyed her country home at Boughton Malherbe in Kent. O'Neill continued as groom to the bedchamber, was made captain of the King's horse guards, became a member of parliament for St Ives in 1662, was admitted to Gray's Inn, and sat as an absentee representative in the Irish parliament of 1661. He also was granted extensive mining rights and privileges, held the coveted monopoly of sole manufacturer of gunpowder to the crown, was appointed surveyor of the petty customs and tonnage, and was the accountant for the regulation of ale houses. And for the payment of &pound;21,000 annually he became the postmaster-general of all the king's dominions, with the monopoly of carrying all letters to the colonies with power to make contacts with his continental counterparts. Still in the king's service, he worked as the warden of St James's Palace and park, served as building commissioner in London, and co-ordinated the recovery of the royal family's heirlooms. He did not neglect his friends. He helped to restore Antrim to his Irish estates, assisted Sir Henry Bennet in becoming secretary of state, and looked after the well-being of his niece and nephew and three stepchildren. When O'Neill died in his Whitehall lodgings, on 24 October 1664, the king wrote, &#145;Poor Oneale died &hellip; of an ulcer in his guts; he was an honest man as ever lived; I am sure I have lost a very good servant&#146;  (Charles II to the duchess of Orl&eacute;ans, 24 Oct 166[4], Dalrymple, 2.2.27). The diarist Samuel Pepys commented that &#145;This day the great O'Neale died; I believe, to the content of all the protestants in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Samuel Pepys</span>, ed. H. B. Wheatley, vol. 4, 1894, 273&#150;4). O'Neill was buried at Boughton Malherbe parish church. His wife was the major beneficiary of his accumulated wealth.<h2>
<a name="Historicalsummary"></a>Historical summary</h2>O'Neill's inscripted epitaph lauding how he &#145;added new lustre by his own merit&#146; to his honorable ancestry  (Cregan, 5.73) is also appropriate for his life and career. His accomplishments were considerable, given his father's disappointing bequest and the family's situation in post-plantation Ulster. From early on he appreciated how his fortune was tied to royal favour. Even in desperate times he knew there was no alternative to the crown's goodwill. Raised as a protestant, he never made an issue of religion. He tolerated the old faith and used protestantism as a badge of his political correctness. He endured by using his nurtured charm to gain influential friends and manipulate circumstances to his advantage. His personal dexterity was a major factor in his broad appeal. An experienced soldier, he was also the ultimate courtier, an intimate of the royal family, and confidant to policy makers. His activities during the decades of war and exile were remarkable testimonies to his endurance and political acumen. His post-Restoration awards, together with his magnanimity, speak to the quality of his character and the success of his endeavours. All told, he was probably a better royalist than an Irishman.<br>
