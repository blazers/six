<span class="headword">Maurice,  Mary Atkinson</span>  (1797&#150;1858), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Kirby Cane, Norfolk, the second daughter of the Revd Michael Maurice, a Unitarian minister and schoolmaster, and his wife, Priscilla Maurice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurry). She was educated by her father along with some of her sisters and neighbours, showing a particular gift for languages and literature, and as she grew older, she helped to teach her numerous younger sisters. She was the most practical and businesslike member of the family.<br>
<br>In 1825 Mary Maurice moved with the family to Southampton, and when they ran into financial difficulties, she opened her own school, assisted by her younger sister Priscilla. She had become interested in the ideas of Pestalozzi, and spent some time with the Revd Charles Mayo and his sister Elizabeth Mayo at their school in Cheam, studying the Pestalozzian methods adopted there. She and some of her sisters and her brother had abandoned the Unitarian views of their father, causing great hurt in the family; under the influence of Mayo and others, she now became an Anglican, and opened her school as a church school. In 1829 she published anonymously <span class="italic">Aids to Development</span>, suggesting methods of instruction by which mothers might educate their own children. Her school prospered, and the need for larger premises led her to move to Reading, where she ran a school for nearly ten years with the help of another sister, Esther. When Esther married Julius Hare in 1844, Mary gave up the school and moved to London.<br>
<br>Mary Maurice was already a subscriber to the Governesses' Benevolent Institution (GBI), which was attempting to alleviate and improve the lives and work of governesses. It was the experiences and persuasion of Mary and her younger sisters which led their brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18384/', "(John) Frederick Denison Maurice")</script>, to join the institution's committee. When Mary Maurice moved to Hanover Terrace, London, she took a more active role in the institution's work, in the belief that governesses needed more than financial aid, necessary as that was; they needed education, and recognized qualifications, which would in turn lead to their being given greater respect. In <span class="italic">Mothers and Governesses</span> (1847) she wrote of the task of education as &#145;an honourable and dignified calling, next only to the sacred ministry of the Gospel&#146;  (p. 148). And in <span class="italic">Governess Life: its Trials, Duties and Encouragements</span> (1849) she encouraged governesses to set and maintain certain standards (which she described in some detail), both for their own sakes and for those of their employers. Drawing on her own experience, she urged them to make use of educational opportunities, which in her view were best found under instruction from men. Thus she was one of the promoters of Queen's College, Harley Street, opened in 1848 under the auspices of the GBI, with her brother F. D. Maurice as principal. Mary Maurice was a very generous subscriber to the new college, and served as one of the early &#145;lady visitors&#146;. In addition, she served on the committee of, and raised a large amount of money for, the Asylum for Aged Governesses, which the GBI also opened in Harley Street.<br>
<br>Mary Maurice spent the last two years of her life with her sister and brother-in-law, Lucilla and William Powell, in Kensington, finally returning to the county of her birth, where she died of peritonitis, in Apsley Terrace, Great Yarmouth, on 4 October 1858. She was buried there, in St Nicholas's Church, among her Hurry ancestors. In her memory an additional aisle was added to St John's Church in Great Yarmouth, for the building of which she had raised and personally contributed much money.<br>
