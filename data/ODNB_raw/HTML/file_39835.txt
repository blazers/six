<span class="headword">Jennings,  Paul Francis</span>  (1918&#150;1989), <span class="occ">humorist</span>, was born in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 20 June 1918, the only son and second of the three children of William Benedict Jennings, musician, and his wife, Mary Gertrude Hewitt, the daughter of a watchmaker. They soon moved to a Coventry Roman Catholic parish, where Paul's father was organist and choirmaster, and Paul became the city's boy soprano, performing solo at the Hippodrome. Music was an absorbing interest from Paul's youth, as was his religion. He won a scholarship to the King Henry VIII School at Coventry, but went on to Douai in France, his parents thinking he might have a vocation for the priesthood. He loved Douai and its admirable headmaster, Father Ignatius Rice, but decided he was not cut out for the priesthood. His grounding in the classics fed his literary imagination and his loving, lifelong, obsessive play with words.<br>
<br>Jennings's humour was innate, or at least formed very early. He joined the Royal Corps of Signals in the Second World War and, when he was a subaltern in India in 1943, <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> published a characteristic piece of his, beginning: &#145;Have you ever watched a soldier marching, and wondered what he was thinking about? If he's a Young Soldier, I can tell you! He is thinking about a little booklet excitingly titled &#147;Army Form B51&#148;&#146;. <span class="italic">Punch</span> took an army piece in 1945. Jennings worked at the central office of information (1946&#150;7) and in advertising (1947&#150;9). His celebrated parody of Jean-Paul Sartre appeared in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1948: &#145;Resistentialism is a philosophy of tragic grandeur &hellip; deriving its name from the thesis that Things resist Men &hellip; <i>Les choses sont contre nous</i>&#146;. Resistentialism's leading luminary was Pierre-Marie Ventre, who built on the work of his nineteenth-century predecessors, Friedegg and Heidansiecker. Jennings imagined the seminal play &#145;Puits clos&#146; about three old men endlessly stumbling over bricks in the bottom of a well. (It was used by <span class="italic">Time</span> magazine as a news story.) In 1949 he joined the staff of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, with a regular column, &#145;Oddly Enough&#146;, which continued for seventeen years. His method was to start with something very familiar and then spin illogical and fantastic speculations around it, creating a brilliant and often subversive parody.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Observer</span> years, which lasted until 1966, were years of fulfilment, establishing Jennings, as <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituarist adjudged, as &#145;the most consistently original English comic writer of our century&#146;  (29 Dec 1989). In the year he joined <span class="italic">The Observer</span> so did <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37200/', "Eric Blom")</script>, as its music critic, and Jennings met his daughter, Celia. They married in 1952 and later had three sons and three daughters; the marriage was a happy one and ended only with his death. Jennings knew a great deal about music; he sang madrigals with the Oriana Society and enjoyed singing&#151;as far afield as Istanbul&#151;with the Philharmonia Chorus and the London Philharmonic Choir. As he noted, &#145;For members of choirs, there's harmony beyond the heard harmony of music&#146;.<br>
<br>The family moved from Hampstead to East Bergholt in Suffolk, and Jennings's pieces in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> began to reflect his deep love of that county. His wife became involved in the work of the Suffolk Preservation Society. To celebrate its sixtieth anniversary in 1989, she edited a book to which her husband contributed inimitably&#151;not only the title, <span class="italic">Suffolk for Ever</span>, but the last word. This was a clever discussion, disguised as a Platonic dialogue, of the complexities and the pitfalls confronting everyone moved to action by the erosions of our environs. In <span class="italic">The English Difference</span> (1974)&#151;the wide-ranging book Jennings edited, and mostly wrote&#151;he illustrated his speculative inclination:<blockquote>You can see on the face of a child, deep in a game, the kind of total absorption observable in the figure of Pythagoras, <span class="italic">Thinking</span>, carved on a portal at Chartres. &hellip; Though children the world over play games, it is the English who, perhaps sensing the Death of God, once did unconsciously try to preserve religion in their untranslatable phrase <i>playing the game</i>.</blockquote>After 1966 Jennings wrote freelance, and from this period emerged his compilation, <span class="italic">The Book of Nonsense</span> (1977). He mourned the loss of anything old-fashioned: steam trains, red telephone kiosks, the Fahrenheit classification of temperature. His prejudices were conservative and patriotic.<br>
<br>Jennings's <span class="italic">Observer</span> (and other) essays were collected and published with such titles as <span class="italic">Even Oddlier</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Next to Oddliness</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Golden Oddlies</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">The Paul Jennings Reader</span> (1990). <span class="italic">The Living Village</span> (1968) was a picture of the women's institutes of Britain. He also wrote two children's books. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Jennings suffered serious illnesses&#151;including tuberculosis and a heart attack&#151;all belied by the laughter of his high, quick, musical voice and by lively, wide-open, grey eyes. He and his wife moved to Orford, on the Suffolk coast, where he died of liver cancer at his home, 25 High Street, on 26 December 1989.<br>
