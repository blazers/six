<span class="headword">Parr, Sir  Henry Hallam</span>  (1847&#150;1914), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 24 July 1847, the second son of Thomas Clements Parr, a barrister, and Julia, eldest daughter of Sir Charles Elton, bt, of Clevedon. He was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst and commissioned in the 13th light infantry on 8 September 1865. Regimental service took Parr to Ireland, Gibraltar, Malta, and South Africa, with promotion to a lieutenancy on 30 October 1869.<br>
<br>While serving at the Cape in 1874 Parr was appointed district staff officer for Natal, and Sir Garnet Wolseley, then high commissioner, recommended him as private secretary to J. A. Froude, who was being sent out to organize a conference on South African federation. The conference did not take place, but in 1877 Parr became successively aide-de-camp and military secretary to the high commissioner for South Africa, Sir Bartle Frere. Promoted captain on 23 January 1878, Parr was responsible for inspecting colonial units during the Cape Frontier War of 1877&#150;8. Frere then released him to act as assistant staff officer to the ill-fated No. 3 column for the invasion of Zululand. Fortunately for Parr, he accompanied that part of the column absent from camp at Isandlwana when it was overwhelmed by the Zulu on 22 January 1879. Parr returned to Frere's staff in April and took part in Frere's negotiations with Boer representatives in the Transvaal. Apparently due to opposition from the commander-in-chief, George, duke of Cambridge, Parr failed to receive a brevet for his services in South Africa, but he was created CMG.<br>
<br>With Frere's recall, Parr briefly rejoined his regiment but, following the death of Sir George Colley's private secretary in action at Ingogo on 8 February 1881 during the Anglo-Transvaal War, he was sent for as a replacement. However, Colley himself was killed at Majuba before Parr reached Natal, and he then acted as chief staff officer in Natal before taking charge of the remount depot. Parr commanded an experimental mounted infantry unit in the closing stages of the war before returning to England in May 1882. Almost at once, Wolseley appointed him to command the mounted infantry for the Egyptian campaign on 2 August. Parr was severely wounded in the leg at Tell al-Mahuta on 24 August but, on recovering, commanded the mounted police in occupied Egypt as provost marshal, receiving his brevet majority on 18 November 1882.<br>
<br>Subsequently, Parr transferred to the reorganized Egyptian army, and in February 1884 went to Suakin to command a mixed force of Turkish cavalry and Sudanese infantry. He was present at Tamai and received his brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 21 May 1884. After commanding at El Shallal, he became adjutant-general of the Egyptian army, becoming colonel on 24 November 1886 and an aide-de-camp to the queen. However, his health broke in 1887 and, after declining appointment as military attach&eacute; both at Berlin and in Australia, he became assistant adjutant-general to southern command in October 1889. In 1888 Parr married Lilian, daughter of George Monck Gibbs. His eldest son died of fever while serving with Parr's former regiment on Malta in February 1910 and his second son was killed with the same regiment in December 1914.<br>
<br>Command of his former battalion came in November 1890 and Parr served with it in Aldershot, Gibraltar, and India, as well as being briefly attached to Sir Charles Ewan-Smith's mission to Fez in early 1892. He was made CB in 1893 and, having turned down the post of assistant adjutant-general in India, he took the appointment of assistant inspector of ordnance at the War Office. In 1898 he went to the Shorncliffe command and was promoted major-general on 1 July 1899. Parr was mentioned as a possible chief of staff to Sir Redvers Buller at the outbreak of the South African War, but his health was not considered sufficiently robust, and from Shorncliffe he went to command the south-east district. He moved to the north-west district in 1902 but recurring health problems led to early retirement in November 1903.<br>
<br>In retirement, Parr became a deputy lieutenant for Somerset and a justice of the peace in Dorset. With the creation of the Territorial Force in 1908, Parr joined the county Territorial Association for Somerset and commanded the county's contingent of the national reserve. He was made KCB in 1911. He died, shortly after writing to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to support the incorporation of the Ulster Volunteer Force within the Territorials, on 4 April 1914 at his residence, Chaffeymoor House, Bourton, in Dorset.<br>
