<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lytton,  Edward Robert  Bulwer-</span>, first earl of Lytton <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Owen Meredith]</span>  (1831&#150;1891), <span class="occ">viceroy of India and poet</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17314/', "Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton, first Baron Lytton (1803&#150;1873)")</script>, and his wife, Rosina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wheeler (1802&#150;1882) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17316/', "Lytton, Rosina Anne Doyle Bulwer")</script>]. He was born in London on 8 November 1831 and educated first privately, then at Harrow School and at Bonn, where he specialized in modern languages. He began composing poetry early and showed a precocious talent. Although not published until 1855, most of the poems in his first volume, <span class="italic">Clytemnestra, The Earl's Return and other Poems</span> (which went under the pseudonym Owen Meredith), were written before 1849. This was followed in 1857 by <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span>, a volume of lyrical poems. Both were fairly well received by literary audiences, particularly for their poetic diction, vivid description and strokes of imagination. Reviews such as those in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and the London <span class="italic">Spectator</span> were guarded, however, speaking largely of the poet's youth and promise, and his need to develop his powers. In form, the poems were widely held to be too imitative of Browning. Lytton's interests in poetry at this time brought him into contact with London literary circles where he developed friendships with Charles Dickens and John Forster. He was especially close to Forster, conducting a voluminous correspondence with him, and acting as one of his executors at Forster's death in 1876.<h2>
<a name="Diplomacyandliterature"></a>Diplomacy and literature</h2>Lytton was at the same time pursuing a diplomatic career. In 1849 he went to Washington as private secretary to the ambassador, his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3935/', "(William) Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer, Baron Dalling")</script>. He acted in the same capacity when Dalling was moved to Florence before becoming paid attach&eacute; to the embassies at The Hague and then Vienna. From Vienna he went to Belgrade as acting consul-general and collected commercial intelligence. In 1862 he was appointed second secretary at Vienna, and in 1863 was made secretary of legation at Copenhagen at the time of the marriage of Princess Alexandra of Denmark with the prince of Wales. Lytton himself married, in 1864, <a href="#cosubject_48938">Edith Villiers [<i>see below</i>]</a>. In the same year he served at Athens and in the following year at Lisbon, where he negotiated an important commercial treaty. At both of these courts he also acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Lytton's literary reputation was further enhanced by the publication in 1860 of <span class="italic">Lucile</span>, a novel in verse, which some reviewers objected would have been as well cast in prose. It was a poem with which later he was to become disenchanted. It represented the first of a series of experiments in which he attempted to reproduce in the English language the rhythms and diction of continental prose and verse. In <span class="italic">Lucile</span> he drew heavily on George Sand's <span class="italic">Lavinia</span> and sought to catch, in rhyming anapaestic couplets, the sensibilities of the French novel. The next year, in conjunction with his friend Julian Fane, he wrote <span class="italic">Tannhauser</span> (published under the pseudonyms Neville Temple and Edward Trevor). In the same year he published <span class="italic">Serbski pesme</span>, based upon Serbian national songs. These works had a very mixed reception. His <span class="italic">Tannhauser</span> was thought a pallid imitation of Tennyson and his <span class="italic">Serbski pesme</span> was subjected to a severe attack by Lord Strangford in the pages of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>.<br>
<br>None the less, Lytton persevered, and reproduced his Serb-derived poems in the appendix to <span class="italic">Orval, or, The Fool in Time</span> (1869). <span class="italic">Orval</span> was a paraphrase of Count Sigismund Krasinski's <span class="italic">Infernal Comedy</span> and was heavily influenced by the Polish school of mystical poetry which had arisen out of the loss of Polish independence. Lytton became closely associated with the count, and was attracted to the idea of writing heroic social drama. In 1868 he had published <span class="italic">Chronicles and Characters</span>, which consisted of poetic imitations of great men at the time of great events, from the era of Greek mythology to the days of Richelieu. However, it was compared unfavourably to Victor Hugo's <span class="italic">L&eacute;gend des si&egrave;cles</span>. Lytton had to wait until the publication of <span class="italic">Fables in Song</span> (1874) to establish his full poetic reputation. <span class="italic">Fables in Song</span> expressed his own voice much more directly and was credited with gracefulness and luminosity. The next year he privately circulated among friends <span class="italic">King Poppy</span>, which he came to regard as his finest achievement. However, he was unable to revise it for publication until shortly before his death, and it appeared only posthumously, in 1892.<br>
<br>During these years Lytton also continued his diplomatic career, being successively employed from 1868 to 1872 at Madrid and then at Vienna, where he had a large share in the negotiation of another commercial treaty. From 1872 to 1874 he was secretary to the embassy at Paris; in November 1874 he was promoted to be British minister at Lisbon. In January 1873 he succeeded as second Baron Lytton on the death of his father, to whom he was deeply attached. A two-volume biography of his father which he published in 1883 dealt extensively with the latter's early literary and political career. However, it drew to a close before 1836, the year in which his father and mother began the acrimonious separation proceedings which&#151;in law courts, on theatrical stages, and in literary works&#151;were to scandalize polite society for the next thirty years. Lytton's loyalties were clear, and one commentator observed that the biography was &#145;only too complete on the unhappy relations between his father and mother&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chambers</span>, 638).<h2>
<a name="ViceroyofIndia"></a>Viceroy of India</h2>The most significant phase of Lytton's public life began in January 1876 when, a year after Lytton had declined the governorship of Madras, Disraeli offered him the viceroyalty of India in succession to Lord Northbrook. The appointment, which was usually reserved for politicians rather than men of letters, caused general astonishment. But Disraeli, a literary man himself, was insistent. It may have been that he saw in Lytton's highly developed romantic sensibility the perfect instrument for one of his own most favoured projects&#151;the proclamation of Queen Victoria as queen empress of India and the construction around her of a new system of imperial monarchy. These were to represent the first, and visually the most stunning, of Britain's many contributions to the culture of the new imperialism which was rising in Europe at this time.<br>
<br>Lytton arrived in India, and was installed as viceroy on 12 April 1876. He immediately threw himself into the task of organizing a great durbar, or pageant, to celebrate the proclamation; this took place on 1 January 1877. The key feature of the durbar, which attempted to hark back to the rituals of the Mughal empire, was the ceremonial display of loyalty and fealty to the queen empress expressed by India's own princes and maharajas. Since the Indian Mutiny of 1857 British policy had turned away from seeking to expand direct rule and to transform and Westernize Indian society. A new respect had been found for the remaining indigenous princes, who still held a third of the sub-continent's territory and on whose &#145;traditional authority&#146; the British now hoped to build the pillars of their raj. Lytton's durbar publicly symbolized their closer association with the crown as well as the new ethos of conservatism which marked the era. Critics, both at the time and since, have mocked the garishness of the durbar's displays and its blatant invention of oriental traditions, devised to suit melodramatic European tastes rather than faithfully to recreate the Mughal past. But the durbar's rituals were to set a public style of rulership which henceforth characterized the British raj, and provided inspiration for the new ceremonials of imperial monarchy which were subsequently developed in Britain to celebrate coronations and royal weddings and jubilees. In India, the new alliance with the princes held firm until the very last decade of British rule.<br>
<br>In a variety of other ways too, Lytton's viceroyalty served the ends of the new imperialism and the growing assertiveness of British power in the world. But they were ways which provoked high levels of controversy and revealed deepening contradictions in Britain's imperial project. Lytton's term of office was one of the most turbulent in viceregal history, ending in widespread public outcry, the defeat of Lord Beaconsfield's government, and the near bankruptcy of the government of India.<br>
<br>On the one hand, and in sharp contrast to a rhetoric aimed at evoking India's medieval princely past, Lytton pushed hard to advance British economic interests, even at the expense of the revenues and economy of India itself. Much influenced during his diplomatic career by the ideology of free trade, he enacted in India the repeal of the duties on cotton imports against the advice and votes of virtually his entire executive council. This emboldened him to pursue a radical reform of the whole customs and excise system which was to make India one of the most advanced free-trading economies in the world. In his last year in office he also gave his fervent support to a plan greatly to improve India's internal systems of transport and communication, most notably by vastly expanding the railways. How a supposedly traditional and princely India might have survived the large-scale onslaught of modern technology&#151;any more than of free-market economics&#151;is not clear, but the India Office quashed most of the plan for reasons of financial stringency.<h2>
<a name="TheSecondAngloAfghanWar"></a>The Second Anglo-Afghan War</h2>On the other hand, Lytton's sympathies for India's princes also conflicted with his attitudes towards the traditional rulers just beyond its borders. In what was to become the <i>cause cel&egrave;bre</i> of his viceroyalty, he adopted a very &#145;forward&#146; policy towards Afghanistan and provoked the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Ostensibly, his actions in Afghanistan were a defensive response to Russian expansion towards Turkmenistan and Samarkand which threatened the neutrality of Kabul. This was the more the case because failures by the British in 1873 to provide guarantees of protection to the Afghan amir, Sher Ali, had alienated him from their cause and opened the way for increasing Russian influence. However, there is much in Lytton's conduct to suggest that Beaconsfield's government had long decided on a policy aimed at bringing Afghanistan directly under the control of British Indian authority. The idea that it should be in relations with Calcutta, which secured for India a &#145;scientific frontier&#146;, was included in the treaty of Gandamak, signed with the puppet Amir Yakub in 1879. And Lytton clung to the notion of extending the Indian railway system to Kandahar in order to anchor the kingdom permanently to the sub-continent to its south.<br>
<br>The Afghan imbroglio began shortly after Lytton's installation as viceroy. He immediately dispatched an emissary to Sher Ali requesting treaty discussions. When the amir refused even to admit the emissary, Lytton was provoked to the celebrated remark that Afghanistan was merely &#145;an earthern pipkin between two metal pots&#146;. Other problems delayed the crushing of the pipkin for a further two years. Then, in 1878, Lytton launched an invasion across the Khyber and Bolan passes which initially met with considerable success. Sher Ali was forced to flee Kabul, dying in exile the next year, and a new amir, the British client Yakub, was imposed in his stead. A permanent residency was also established under the direction of Major Louis Cavagnari, a notorious member of the &#145;forward&#146; school who had little regard for or sensitivity towards indigenous peoples. Cavagnari cabled regular reports stressing the popular &#145;support&#146; which the invasion was receiving and the &#145;calm&#146; which it had restored to Afghan society. On 2 September 1879 he informed Lytton, &#145;All well&#146;. The next day Cavagnari, his staff, and their entire escort were massacred inside the residency at the start of a large-scale uprising which had been brewing for many months. Lytton responded by unleashing a new conquest force; this met with bitter resistance and made only slow progress. British soldiers matched Afghan brutality measure for measure until stories of atrocities began to circulate back in England. The escalating costs of the war also caused widespread concern, although their full extent was not known until afterwards. In February 1880 Lytton even managed to post a budget showing a surplus of &pound;400,000; however, due to peculiarities in the system of military accounting, this was later revealed to conceal a deficit in excess of &pound;4 million. The total cost of the war was &pound;17,490,000 against Lytton's own estimate of &pound;5,750,000. In addition, &pound;5 million was spent on constructing railways at the frontier.<br>
<br>In Britain, the Second Anglo-Afghan War became a major issue at the general election of March 1880, where Beaconsfield's Conservative government was soundly beaten by W. E. Gladstone's Liberals. Lytton promptly tendered his resignation, which was handed to the queen at the same time as Lord Beaconsfield's own. The Gladstone government appointed Lord Ripon as viceroy and dispatched him with the first task of extracting the army from Afghanistan, ending the war, and terminating the &#145;forward&#146; policy.<h2>
<a name="AssessmentofLyttonsviceroyalty"></a>Assessment of Lytton's viceroyalty</h2>Yet if the controversy surrounding the Anglo-Afghan War represented the highest point of contention in Lytton's viceroyalty, it cannot be said to have been an isolated peak. From the very beginning his term of office was conflictual, especially in relation to two other issues. First, he came to alienate the rising class of Western-educated Indians, who were then starting to express their own political voice, and then to play an inadvertent role in stimulating Indian nationalism. In 1878, to silence vociferous criticism of his Afghan adventure, he passed the <span class="roman">Vernacular Press Act</span>, which singled out newspapers published in Indian languages and subjected them to procedures of censorship. This was widely regarded in India as a tacit form of racial discrimination and a sign of the hollowness of the promise in the queen empress's proclamation that all her subjects within the empire were to be accorded equal rights. At the time of the proclamation the promise had been baited with the offer to open immediately one-sixth of the vacancies in the Indian Civil Service to native-born Indians. Its emptiness may be judged from the fact that it took another forty years for this goal to be achieved. Lytton's viceroyalty highlighted that contradiction between the words and the actions of British imperialism which was to provide the animus behind the eventual foundation of the Indian National Congress in 1885.<br>
<br>The second issue also had a bearing on Indian nationalism, although it was scarcely less important for provoking anti-imperial sentiment in Britain. Shortly after Lytton took up office, one of the worst famines in British Indian history broke in the south and the west. The severe loss of life which followed in its wake contrasted sharply with imperial propaganda which had long emphasized the benefits bestowed on India by British rule. There were even suggestions that British misrule had been a primary cause of the famine, an accusation brought to the attention of the British public by the activities of the journalist William Digby and the businessman Dadabhai Naoroji, a British resident, who was a Liberal member of parliament and later three times a president of the Indian National Congress. Lytton sought to have the charges repudiated in Britain while, in India, he reformed the procedures of famine administration so drastically as to hint that there may have been substance to them. The nature of his reforms remains controversial. Convinced of the efficacy of free trade, he staunchly supported the policies of Sir John Strachey and Sir Richard Temple which eschewed direct intervention in the grain market but instead offered money for work. However, the policy may have underestimated the weakness at that time of the infrastructure supporting a system of market distribution. Large areas of the country were poorly served by railways and roads and as many as 5 million people died of starvation during the famine.<br>
<br>None the less, the long-term effects of the establishment of the new famine code were undoubtedly beneficial and mark the most significant&#151;and perhaps the only&#151;achievement of Lytton's viceroyalty. Market infrastructure was much improved by roads built under the money-for-work programme. In addition, procedures for monitoring drought and price levels were put in place in order to detect and take preventive measures against potential famine ahead of time. A royal commission on famine in India (1880) explored the conditions behind the original disaster and gave its approval to the new famine code, which served (and continues to serve) India down to the end of the twentieth century. After 1876&#150;8, no subsequent famine was to cause remotely so much devastation and loss of life, and between 1901 and 1943 India was safeguarded from famine entirely.<h2>
<a name="ResignationandtheFrenchembassy"></a>Resignation, and the French embassy</h2>Following his resignation Lytton returned to England; he was created earl of Lytton on 28 April 1880. He made one speech in the House of Lords in defence of his Afghanistan policy but then withdrew from public life for several years, during which time he concentrated on his writings, producing the two-volume biography of his father and several other works. He had high hopes of <span class="italic">Glenaveril</span>, a narrative poem in six books published in 1885, but it was not well received. However, his <span class="italic">After Paradise</span> (1887), which returned to the spirit of <span class="italic">Fables in Song</span>, drew more positive critical acclaim. In 1887 he was elected lord rector of Glasgow University and then, amid characteristic controversy and voluble opposition, was appointed ambassador to France.<br>
<br>Lytton was not at all in sympathy with the politics of the Third Republic. He did, however, have an extensive knowledge of French literature and culture which was to stand him in good stead. He converted the British embassy into a literary salon regularly attended by the cream of Parisian intellectual society in which French politicians of different parties could also meet and converse. His role became that of influencing discussion rather than leading and directing it. In consequence, he drew praise from all sides and can be credited with having preserved and developed friendly relations with France during a period of repeated political irritations. He did not accept his belated acclaim gracefully, once remarking: &#145;I devoted my life to India and everybody abused me. I come here, do nothing and am praised to the skies&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He continued to write poetry. <span class="italic">The Ring of Amasis</span> (1890), which he reworked from an earlier romance, was a disappointment. But his <span class="italic">Marah</span>, which drew on Heine, and <span class="italic">King Poppy</span> (published posthumously in 1891 and 1892 respectively) were among his most distinguished efforts. Lytton died very suddenly at the British embassy, 39 faubourg St Honor&eacute;, Paris, on 24 November 1891, and was buried at his family's country seat at Knebworth, Hertfordshire. He was survived by his wife, <a name="cosubject_48938"></a><span class="headword">Edith  Bulwer-Lytton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Villiers]</span></span>, countess of Lytton  (1841&#150;1936)<span class="occ"></span>, the second daughter of the Hon. Edward Villiers and the niece of George Villiers, fourth earl of Clarendon. They had married on 4 October 1864 after a courtship complicated by his penury. She brought him &pound;6000 a year and bore him four sons and three daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59381/', "Elizabeth Balfour, later countess of Balfour (1867&#150;1942)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37705/', "Lady Constance Georgina Bulwer-Lytton")</script>, who was later to earn notoriety as a suffragette, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32169/', "Victor Alexander George Robert Bulwer-Lytton")</script>, who succeeded to the earldom and served as governor of Bengal and acting viceroy of India, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39466/', "Neville Stephen Lytton")</script>. Lady Lytton was devoted to her husband and strongly supported his diplomatic career as companion and hostess. However, it was as vicereine of India that she came into her own. Finding the viceregal court &#145;very dull and coarse&#146; compared to the glittering palaces of Europe, she set out to transform its style. She and her daughters became particularly distinguished for their displays of high fashion, sustained by regular supplies from the couturiers and milliners of Paris. She also became a noted benefactress of the cause of female education, especially with regard to the zenanas of the Indian princes.<br>
<br>After Lytton's death Lady Lytton faced straitened financial circumstances. Her husband had been a particular favourite of the queen, who had even permitted him the rare distinction, while viceroy, of addressing her in the first person. She responded to Lady Lytton's plight by inviting her&#151;in a letter also written in the first person&#151;to attend court as a lady-in-waiting. This role Lady Lytton performed from 1895 to 1905, serving also Queen Alexandra. During the first four years of her service she kept a diary, parts of which were published many years after her death. It records the daily comings and goings and the gossip of the court during Queen Victoria's last years. In 1905 she withdrew from court to a long retirement spent quietly in a house built for her on the Knebworth estate. The house maintained her connections with India for it was designed by her son-in-law Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was the principal architect of the last British imperial capital at New Delhi. She died in her ninety-sixth year, on 17 September 1936, and was buried beside her husband at Knebworth.<br>
<br>Both during his lifetime and afterwards, Lord Lytton was compared to the ideal &#145;Renaissance man&#146;. Certainly his talents&#151;as poet, linguist, diplomat, and statesman&#151;were many and varied. However, his greatest achievements came in those areas for which he had only limited regard. His bearing, interest in culture, and knowledge of European languages made him highly successful at moving in the diplomatic circles of aristocratic Europe, and also at introducing to English audiences the genius of the continental Romantic movement. But his own poetry and statesmanship were marked by over-ambition. With the exception of two or three works, his poetry lacked originality and rarely rose above the level of pastiche. In addition, the elaboration of the famine code apart, his viceroyalty in India was a many-sided failure which helped to set the British raj on the path to its eventual extinction. His disaster in Afghanistan broke the spell of British invincibility and encouraged other European powers then rising to challenge for colonial possessions and a share of world dominance. His policies of discriminating between the rights of British and of Indian subjects within the empire and of favouring the traditions of the princes over the modernities represented by the Western-educated classes contributed to the deepening isolation and ossification of the imperial state. As imperial rituals and display became ever grander, the British raj alienated ever broader sections of Indian public opinion and doomed itself to fall among the first victims to anti-colonial nationalism in the twentieth century.<br>
