<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Myles William Patrick</span>  (1825&#150;1880), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of William O'Reilly of Knock Abbey, co. Louth, and Margaret, daughter of Dowell O'Reilly of The Heath, Queen's county. He was educated at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, near Durham, and at the University of London, where he graduated BA in 1845; subsequently he took the degree of LLD at Rome. In 1859 he married Ida (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of Edward Jerningham.<br>
<br>A gentlemen farmer who bred prize cattle and kept racehorses, O'Reilly joined the Louth rifles militia, in which he held a captain's commission. Invited to Rome by Pius IX he entered the pontifical service, with the rank of major, and was appointed to the command of the Irish brigade. He rose to the challenge of training an undisciplined body of men under very difficult circumstances. In September 1860 the battalion of St Patrick gallantly defended Spoleto against Piedmontese troops, who were repeatedly repulsed. O'Reilly's wife was with him until the women were granted safe conduct by the Piedmontese; O'Reilly himself surrendered only when his position had become untenable.<br>
<br>After his return to Ireland, O'Reilly was elected MP, in March 1862, for the county of Longford, and for many years he was prominent in the House of Commons among the debaters on Irish and military subjects. He was a member of Archbishop Cullen's National Association, urging Catholic causes in the Commons, especially the issue of Catholic education, and of Isaac Butt's Home Rule Party. He was also a magistrate for the counties of Louth and Dublin. Besides occasional pamphlets and articles, he published <span class="italic">Memorials of those who suffered for the Catholic faith in Ireland in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries</span> (1868), reissued in New York in 1869 and reprinted there in 1878 under the title <span class="italic">Lives of the Irish martyrs and confessors, with additions, including a history of the penal laws, by [the] Rev. Richard Brennan, A.M.</span>. On at least one occasion he acted as examiner in classics at the Catholic University, Dublin, at the time when John Henry Newman was at its head. In 1878 his wife died, and in April 1879 he vacated his seat in parliament, when he accepted the post of assistant commissioner of intermediate education in Ireland.<br>
<br>O'Reilly died at 14 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin, on 6 February 1880, and was interred in the family burial-place at Philipstown, near Knock Abbey.<br>
