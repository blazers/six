<span class="headword">Edmonds,  Thomas Rowe</span>  (1803&#150;1889), <span class="occ">actuary and political economist</span>, was born on 20 June 1803 in Penzance, the third of seven children of Richard Edmonds (1774&#150;1860), solicitor, and town clerk of Marazion, Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth (1770&#150;1840), daughter of Thomas Nicholas and his wife, Mary Rowe. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8487/', "Richard Edmonds")</script>, the antiquary and geologist. Edmonds attended Cornwall School, Penzance, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his BA in 1826. He settled in London and in 1832 became actuary to the Legal and General Life Assurance Society, a position he held until his retirement in 1866.<br>
<br>Recent scholars have paid little attention to Edmonds, and then almost exclusively with reference to his first book, <span class="italic">Practical moral and political economy, or, The government, religion, and institutions most conducive to individual happiness and to national power</span> (1828). This work offers a critique of early industrial capitalism characteristic of Ricardian socialism. Some scholars have found in it anticipations of Karl Marx's theory of surplus value and the conception of capitalism as a historical stage to be succeeded by a more communal stage, which Edmonds called the &#145;social system&#146;. Like others of his generation who proposed improving the lives of the working class by changing institutions, Edmonds felt obliged to respond to Thomas Malthus. In his <span class="italic">Enquiry into the principles of population, exhibiting a system of regulations for the poor; designed immediately to lessen, and finally to remove, the evils which have hitherto pressed upon the labouring classes of society</span> (1832) Edmonds rejected Malthusian pessimism about social reform and tried to show instead that at each stage of human history, human misery is the result of ignorance and of poor government, both remediable conditions. In commercial nations poverty is mainly due to the unequal distribution of property and to the utter dependence of workers on their masters. Nevertheless, Edmonds acknowledged that in a nation like Britain a surplus of labour depressed the income of workers. The best solution to the problem of poverty was to eliminate that labour surplus. This was to be done mainly by promoting emigration to the colonies and by encouraging the working class to delay or forgo marriage. An improving standard of living and rising expectations were the best guarantee that the latter would happen. Changes in the poor law, public encouragement for workers to become independent producers or manufacturers, public patronage of the arts, cultivation of wastelands, the encouragement of investment in life insurance, education, and moral reform all have a place in his plan.<br>
<br>In 1832 Edmonds also published <span class="italic">Life tables founded upon the discovery of a numerical law, regulating the existence of every human being, illustrated by a new theory of the causes producing health and longevity</span>, a book in which he announced the discovery of a mathematical law describing how human mortality changed in geometrical series during three periods of life. It also presented three theoretical or model life tables constructed using his law of mortality. Nearly three decades later Edmonds was involved in a dispute in the <span class="italic">Assurance Magazine</span> (1859&#150;61) over his claim that his law was different from the one Benjamin Gompertz had published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in 1825. While his critics were right about his mathematics, Edmonds can claim originality for his theoretical tables, which he demonstrated corresponded to the best available life tables constructed on vital experience, and for his discussion of the uses to which they could be put. He elaborated these applications in a series of twenty articles in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, fifteen of these in the years 1835&#150;9, in two articles in the <span class="italic">British Medical Almanack</span> (1835&#150;6), and in a further article in the <span class="italic">Actuary Magazine</span> (1855) showing how his methods could be used to study mortality differences between population groups, to measure the sanitary condition of a population, and to study the relationship between mortality and morbidity. Edmonds's publications in the 1830s influenced William Farr, who designed the national system of vital statistics at the general registrar office.<br>
<br>About the time of his retirement Edmonds published three articles in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, one on a new formula for the law of mortality and two others describing in mathematical terms the behaviour of saturated steam. He was elected a fellow of the Statistical Society of London in 1836 and served as a member of its committee on vital statistics. He gave important testimony to the parliamentary select committee on assurance associations in May 1853. He was proposed for the fellowship of the Royal Society on several occasions but never succeeded in gaining election.<br>
<br>Little is known about Edmonds's personal life. He married Elizabeth Elspith Ruddack on 12 July 1833 and had at least two children. His eldest son, Frederic Bernard Edmonds, achieved some notice as a natural philosopher. During his retirement Edmonds continued to live in London. Although well-known in his prime, for the last twenty-five years of his life he seems to have been totally forgotten; he received none of the usual notices on his death. He died at 72 Portsdown Road, Maida Vale, on 6 March 1889.<br>
