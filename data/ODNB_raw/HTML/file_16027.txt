<span class="headword">Langley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1360&#150;1437), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Durham</span>, was born about 1360&#151;in 1433 he described himself as being in his seventies. He was the son of William and Alice Langley of Middleton, Lancashire. His patron was James Radcliffe of Radcliffe, member of a leading Lancashire family, from whose service he transferred to that of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. He trained in the palatinate administration of Lancashire, and was rewarded with a prebend at St Martin's-le-Grand in 1395 and a canonry at St Asaph in 1397; in 1398 he was nominated an executor of Gaunt's will. He was subsequently associated with the establishment of Manchester collegiate church in 1421, and founded a chantry school at Middleton. With the accession of Gaunt's son as Henry IV, Langley served him as secretary (1399&#150;1401), went on the Scottish expedition of 1400, and in 1401 was appointed keeper of the privy seal. Meantime he had obtained the archdeaconry of Norfolk in October 1399, prebends at York Minster and at Bridgnorth in 1401, and, after a dispute over papal provisions, the deanery of York in July 1403. In October 1404 he was recommended by the king as bishop of London and elected, but this was overridden by Pope Innocent VII (<i>r</i>. 1404&#150;6) in favour of Roger Walden (<i>d</i>. 1406). On 2 March 1405 the king appointed him chancellor of England, and secured his election to succeed the executed Archbishop Richard Scrope at York, a suggestion rejected by the pope. On 14 May 1406 Langley received a papal provision to the see of Durham, although his formal election was contested by Thomas Weston, archdeacon of Durham. He was enthroned on 4 September. He resigned the chancellorship on 30 January 1407, but was appointed a member of the king's council at an annual salary of 200 marks (&pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.).<br>
<br>Continuing in royal service Langley was initially active in diplomacy with France. Later in December 1408, at the northern convocation at York, he was appointed to lead the northern delegation to the general council at Pisa to end the great schism in the papacy. He reached Pisa on 7 May 1409 and returned to England in October. On 2 May 1410 Langley was appointed to the newly reconstituted king's council, but rarely attended, probably because he regarded it as unduly influenced by Prince Henry, though he was also heavily engaged in northern affairs at the time. In the summer of 1411 Langley and Bishop Robert Hallum of Salisbury were chosen by Pope John XXIII (<i>r</i>. 1410&#150;15) as cardinals, but their nominations were overruled by Henry IV. That autumn the king resumed control of government and appointed a new council, including Langley, and the latter remained in attendance until the death of the king, who nominated him as an executor. Under Henry V, Langley continued on the council, and was a chief adviser on foreign policy. In January 1414 he headed the commission which concluded a general truce with France to last one year, and then was joint leader of the embassies to Paris of August&#150;September 1414 and March 1415 which failed to avert Anglo-French hostilities. When it was decided to renew war with France, Langley was appointed to the lieutenancy council of John, duke of Bedford. In July 1415, before leaving for France, Henry V made his will, appointing Langley as one of his trustees and an executor. And when Henry V again embarked for France, Langley was appointed chancellor, on 23 July 1417, and, under Bedford, led the council which administered England when the king was abroad. One consequence of Henry's absence was a substantial increase in the amount of judicial work referred to Langley as chancellor, in his capacity as keeper of the king's (public) conscience. Following the death of Henry V on 31 August 1422, Langley resigned the great seal, but was reappointed as chancellor by parliament on 16 November. He finally surrendered the great seal on 16 July 1424, although he continued, with decreasing frequency, to came to meetings of council until excused further attendance on the grounds of age in December 1433.<br>
<br>With such experience in royal administration, it is unsurprising that Langley undertook reorganization of the palatinate powers of the bishops of Durham, using former colleagues from the duchy of Lancaster as receivers-general and treasurers, stewards, and members of his council. He introduced the practice of separate enrolment in his chancery of letters patent and letters close, although chance survivals from other sources indicate that many warrants were not registered. He upheld the claim of his palatinate to immunity from parliamentary taxation by agreeing to pay a sum above that likely to be assessed. There was also an increase in the amount of litigation conducted in his chancery. The actions brought there invariably involved the bishop, a practice parallel to, and no doubt derived from, that of the common-law side of the royal chancery. The revenues of the bishop have been estimated at over &pound;4000 a year, making Langley one of the five wealthiest men in England, in terms of income. Rents slowly declined during his episcopate, in common with elsewhere in England at that date. In 1418 Langley attempted a review of his resources and commissioned a survey of his estates and a register of all inquisitions undertaken since the second quarter of the previous century. Rents of mines and forests yielded about &pound;250 a year; lead sold between 1428 and 1431 yielded &pound;858. It is impossible to be more precise as to revenue, because no account of a receiver-general, Langley's chief financial officer, has survived.<br>
<br>Langley was responsible for substantial building operations at his castles of Norham and Durham, a new gaol at Durham, and gates to both bridges there, alterations to Durham Cathedral, and rebuilding of his manor house at Stockton and the west gate of his palace at Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He loaned substantial sums of money to Henry V, and once to the abbey of St Werburgh, Chester. In 1433, probably at the instigation of Sir William Eure of Witton-le-Wear, co. Durham, a wealthy but aggressive and discontented landowner in the north-east, a comprehensive attack on Langley's palatine administration was made by a royal commission into franchisal abuses in northern England. With his defence strengthened by evidence from the cathedral muniments, Langley went to London and in June 1433 obtained confirmation from the king's chancery of charters recognizing his palatinate powers. The matter was heard in parliament, and the king's council found in Langley's favour.<br>
<br>In view of the proximity of his diocese to the Anglo-Scottish border, it is unsurprising that Langley was employed on various occasions as ambassador to negotiate truces with the Scots, and in 1416 and 1423&#150;4 the release from captivity of James I of Scotland. Between 1424 and 1432, moreover, Langley was at least titular leader of commissions to negotiate settlements of border disputes with the Scots. A conscientious diocesan, he resided twice a year except in 1419. Nevertheless, routine business functioned without him. He had a vicar-general and a suffragan to act for him. Although some of his official business was recorded in his diocesan register, this provides a very imperfect guide to his ecclesiastical administration. He reformed the statutes of the three collegiate churches of Auckland, Lanchester, and Chester-le-Street, to enforce if not residence at least the provision of vicars in the prebends. He also gave new statutes to Sherburn Hospital outside Durham. Langley was reasonably regular in attendance at the northern convocation of clergy at York. He died at Bishop Auckland on 20 November 1437. A keen huntsman, Langley none the less accumulated a small library, whose contents included works of theology, canon and civil law, and history. He donated a St Cuthbert window at York Minster in 1429, and he also founded a chantry in the Galilee chapel of Durham Cathedral, his designated burial place, whose two chaplains were to teach grammar and song to poor children freely&#151;the forerunner of Durham School.<br>
