<span class="headword">Banks,  Joseph Ambrose <span class="st"> [Joe]</span></span>  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">sociologist and historian</span>, was born at 66 Montague Road, Edmonton, Middlesex, on 5 January 1920, the only child of Joseph William Banks, a boot and shoe dealer who later became a master tailor, and his wife, Louisa Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wellman. He was educated at Enfield grammar school, where his mathematics teacher persuaded his father not to take him out of school for a cutter's apprenticeship in tailoring. During the Second World War he was a conscientious objector (as his father, an atheist socialist, had been in the First World War). On 22 June 1944 he married Olive Lucy Davies (1923&#150;2006) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97918/', "Banks, Olive Lucy")</script>], also from a &#145;respectable&#146; working-class background. (She was the daughter of Herbert Davies, builder and contractor.) Although there were no children, their lifelong partnership was fruitful in every other way. Both became leading sociologists of their generation, and shared enthusiasms for dancing, hill-walking, gardening, cinema, and the opera. They each went to read sociology at the London School of Economics in 1947, both excelling sufficiently to qualify for a master's degree under David Glass's supervision. Banks then embarked on the study of the Victorian family, which was to lead to <span class="italic">Prosperity and Parenthood</span> (1954).<br>
<br>Banks's early intellectual and personal formation was profoundly influenced by his participation in the co-operative movement, through which he and Olive had met. From July 1942 for three years he was on the first editorial board of the British Federation of Young Co-operators' monthly magazine, <span class="italic">Comrade</span>, and a member of the education committee of the Enfield Highway Co-operative Society, subsequently serving as secretary of the Southern Co-operative Education Committees Association. The first issue of <span class="italic">Comrade</span> contained a short article, prophetically entitled &#145;Invitation to the Dance&#146; by a certain Olive Davies (they met the following year at the Enfield Co-operative youth group and she taught him ballroom dancing during their courtship). Banks's lifelong local friend Harold Campbell, later national secretary of the Co-operative Party from 1964, was their best man at Enfield register office.<br>
<br>In 1952 Banks was appointed lecturer in the sociology department at Leicester, headed by Ilya Neustadt. Joe&#151;as he was known&#151;was insistent that Olive should also have the career she merited and in 1954 this became possible when both took up posts in the sociology and social work department at the University of Liverpool. They stayed until 1969 when Banks returned to the chair of sociology at Leicester and Olive became reader in sociology (in 1973 she became the first female professor at Leicester). They both took voluntary early retirement in 1982, thereby saving five posts for younger scholars in their department.<br>
<br>Banks became the leading authority of his generation on the fertility decline that took place in Britain between about 1870 and 1914. He was the first to read beyond official statistics into the diverse literary, pamphlet, and newspaper primary sources of the Victorian era and produced a trilogy of contextualized studies that transformed understanding of late nineteenth-century demographics. <span class="italic">Prosperity and Parenthood</span> became a much-republished classic and the starting point for all serious students of the subject. Through a brilliantly innovative analysis of such sources as the changing guidance on etiquette set out in the seven successive editions between 1861 and 1906 of <span class="italic">Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management</span> Banks documented the phenomenon of rising aspirations for &#145;the paraphernalia of gentility&#146; among the middle classes. He showed how escalating costs of secondary education became a crucial element, leading to greatly delayed marriage and ultimately the resort to birth control within marriage. <span class="italic">Feminism and Family Planning</span> (1964, published jointly with Olive Banks) argued that Victorian feminism was wary of association with the subject of contraception and so did not promote family planning. <span class="italic">Victorian Values: Secularism and the Size of Families</span> (1981) explored how respectable upper- and middle-class Victorians squared their religious sensibilities with family limitation.<br>
<br>Banks's inaugural lecture, &#145;Sociology as a vocation&#146;, eloquently echoed Weber and exemplified the &#145;Leicester school&#146; of Norbert Elias and Ilya Neustadt: sociology's specific disciplinary role was the ambition to provide a causal explanation of the current and future course of social change. This was to be through an interpretative understanding of social action, striving to integrate and evaluate all relevant historical and comparative knowledge to arrive at these carefully weighed insights and predictions. Specialization of knowledge of all kinds in commerce, science, professional life, and the academy had, he argued, rendered sociological skills of communication ever more valuable and valued throughout society and the economy. A stream of publications ensued, many based on his collaborative research with the industrial sociology research team led by W. H. Scott in Liverpool, applying a Weberian methodology to industrial relations and technological change. With his schooling in voluntarist co-operation, Banks was critical of Marxist class reductivism and also published widely on the importance of associations and social movements.<br>
<br>In accord with these views, Banks played a leading role in sociology's own professional body, the British Sociological Association. His exceptionally open, warm, and entirely unaffected personality helped enormously&#151;all who came into contact with him found him instantly likeable. Joining as a student at its foundation in 1951, he became an executive member from 1956, secretary from 1964, and chairman in 1971. These were certainly not easy times for a discipline experiencing break-neck institutional expansion and acquiring a reputation for radicalism and subversion. Nevertheless Banks was remembered as a particularly effective leader of his profession. Indeed, his inaugural lecture had characteristically offered a penetrating sociological analysis of precisely these troubling issues in relation to a careful, interpretative evaluation of the significance of the sit-in of March 1967 at the London School of Economics.<br>
<br>In retirement Banks and his wife lived at 30 Lismore Grove, Buxton, Derbyshire. He died on 13 November 2005 at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, following a heart attack.<br>
