<span class="headword">Cavendish,  Michael</span>  (<em>c.</em>1565&#150;1628), <span class="occ">composer and courtier</span>, was the youngest of three children of William Cavendish, landowner, and his wife, Ann Cox, and a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4933/', "George Cavendish (b. 1494, d. in or before 1562?)")</script>, the biographer of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. The family, which can be traced back to the thirteenth century, lived at the manor of Cavendish Overhall, Suffolk, until the house and lands were sold in 1596 by William Cavendish, Michael's eldest brother. However, the dedication of Michael Cavendish's sole publication, <span class="italic">14. Ayres in Tabletorie to the Lute</span> (1598), is &#145;From Cavendish this 24 of July&#146;, so the family may have retained connections with the area.<br>
<br>Only one copy of Cavendish's book is extant, now in the British Library. It is dedicated to Lady Arabella Stuart, Cavendish's second cousin, and comprises twenty-eight compositions: fourteen songs for voice and lute or two voices and bass viol, six more lute songs with alternative versions for four voices alone, and eight madrigals for five voices&#151;a range of performing options which justifies the claim in the dedication that the book &#145;hath in it humours variable for delights sake&#146;.<br>
<br>The songs are tuneful and well crafted, sometimes delicate in expression. The madrigals, more clumsy and old-fashioned, look back to the models of Alfonso Ferrabosco the elder rather than forward to the looser, more expressive style of Thomas Morley; two of them (21 and 22) borrow musically as well as textually from Ferrabosco's settings, published by Nicholas Yonge in the influential second volume of <span class="italic">Musica transalpina</span> (1597). With &#145;Come gentle swains&#146; (24) Cavendish has the distinction of being the first composer to introduce into a printed collection the English refrain which three years later concluded every composition in Morley's collection dedicated to Elizabeth I, <span class="italic">The Triumphs of Oriana</span> (1601):<blockquote>
<div>then sang the shepherds and nimphes of Diana<br>
</div>
<div>Long live faire Oriana.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>A heavily revised version of this madrigal was included in Morley's collection.<br>
<br>Little is known of Cavendish's life. The dedication contains the somewhat bitter generalization that &#145;the policie of times may hold it unfit to raise men humbled with adversities to titles of dearnesse&#146;, which could apply to Cavendish's own situation at the end of Elizabeth's reign. But his fortunes may have revived after the accession of James I, since a manuscript tracing the pedigree of the family states that Cavendish was &#145;Servant in the Bedchamber to Prince Charles&#146;, who was born in 1601  (BL, Add. MS 19122).<br>
<br>Whatever Cavendish's personal fortunes, it is likely that his connections with the more favoured branch of the family headed by William Cavendish, first earl of Devonshire and heir to Chatsworth and Hardwick, brought him into association with several other composers and musicians. His book of songs and madrigals has similarities in style with the <span class="italic">Songs of Sundrie Kindes</span> (1604) by Thomas Greaves, and both end with a group of five-part madrigals. Greaves was employed by Sir Henry Pierrepoint, whose wife, Frances Cavendish, was sister of the first earl and cousin to Michael's father. The madrigalist John Wilbye dedicated one set of published madrigals to Lady Arabella Stuart and the other to Sir Charles Cavendish, the earl's younger brother, who was himself connected by marriage to the Kytsons, Wilbye's patrons at Hengrave Hall. Lady Arabella was also the patron of Tobias Hume and the lutenist Francis Cuttinge. Two of the lyrics set by Cavendish (19 and 20) were later set by Michael East in his <span class="italic">Madrigales to 3. 4. and 5. Parts</span> (1604) and Cavendish's only other extant work, besides his published book, is a contribution to <span class="italic">The Whole Booke of Psalmes</span>, published in 1592 by Thomas East, thought to be the father of Michael East.<br>
<br>As a gentleman amateur with a place at court, Cavendish was not himself fully a member of &#145;a profession worthie some grace&#146; (as he described music in his dedication). But the quality of his few compositions makes him not the least important of an influential group of musicians active around the turn of the century. Other than his service to Prince Charles, nothing is known of his later years. Cavendish's will was dated 5 July 1628 and proved six days later. He died, unmarried, in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, London.<br>
