<span class="headword">Cogan,  Eliezer</span>  (1762&#150;1855), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister, schoolmaster, and classical scholar</span>, was born at Rothwell, Northamptonshire, the son of John Cogan (1698&#150;1784), surgeon and author of <span class="italic">An Essay on the Epistle to the Romans</span>, and his second wife. There had been one son from his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5813/', "Thomas Cogan")</script>, later one of the founders of the Royal Humane Society. Cogan mastered Latin grammar before he was six years old. For six months he went to Stephen Addington's school in Market Harborough, but after that he studied at home and taught himself elementary Greek. During 1780&#150;83 he was at Daventry Academy, studying under Thomas Belsham, and he remained there as assistant tutor until 1786. Most of his fellow pupils went on to become distinguished Unitarians. In 1787 Cogan was elected as minister of the Presbyterian congregation at Cirencester, and remained there until 1789. On 21 September 1790 he married Mary, the daughter of David Atchison of Weedon, Northamptonshire. She died in 1850 at the age of eighty-one, after sixty years of marriage. They had at least one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1791 Cogan moved to Ware in Hertfordshire, but after a few months moved again to Enfield and then to Cheshunt, where he started a school in 1792. He was elected minister of the chapel in Crossbrook Street, Cheshunt, in 1800, and from 1801 to 1816 he was minister of the Old Presbyterian Chapel at Marsh Street, Walthamstow, Essex, where he taught the theology of Joseph Priestley. At the end of 1801 he moved his school from Cheshunt to Essex Hall, Higham Hill, Walthamstow. The school, which was open to pupils of all denominations, became very popular, and at one time he had seventy pupils, with a waiting list of twenty. His pupils included Samuel Sharpe, the Egyptologist and translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>; Benjamin Disraeli, afterwards earl of Beaconsfield (of whom he used to say, &#145;I don't like Disraeli; I never could get him to understand the subjunctive&#146;); Russell Gurney, the recorder of London; and W. E. Nightingale, father of Florence Nightingale. He preached his farewell sermon at Walthamstow at the end of 1816, and in 1828 gave up his school. On his retirement Cogan's pupils presented him with his portrait, painted by Thomas Phillips RA, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1828. In retirement he continued to study Greek, and to play the violin and sing: he was still singing at the age of ninety.<br>
<br>Cogan was highly regarded as a Greek scholar, and had the reputation of having read more Greek than anyone else alive. His many publications included <span class="italic">An Address to the Dissenters on Classical Literature</span> (1789), <span class="italic">Moschi idyllia tria, Graece</span> (1795), and <span class="italic">Sermons Chiefly on Practical Subjects</span> (1817). His son, Richard, collected and published some of his contributions to periodicals in 1856. Cogan died at Essex Hall, Higham Hill, Walthamstow, on 21 January 1855, and was buried on 27 January in the cemetery at the Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney.<br>
