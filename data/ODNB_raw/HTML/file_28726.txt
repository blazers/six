<span class="headword">Wardrop,  James</span>  (1782&#150;1869), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the youngest child of James Wardrop (1738&#150;1830) and his wife, Marjory, daughter of Andrew Marjoribanks, of Marjoriebanks, Dumfriesshire, was born on 14 August 1782 at Torbane Hill, Linlithgow, a small property which had been in the family for generations. Wardrop was educated first under a Mr Stalker and then at Edinburgh high school from the age of seven. In 1797 he was apprenticed to his uncle, Andrew Wardrop (1752&#150;1823), a surgeon in Edinburgh. He also assisted John Barclay, the anatomist, and he was appointed house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, at the age of nineteen.<br>
<br>Wardrop went to London in 1801 to attend the lectures of John Abernethy, Henry Cline, and Astley Cooper, and to see work at St Thomas's, Guy's, and St George's hospitals. In May 1803 he went to Paris, and though English residents in France were treated at the time as prisoners of war, he evaded the police and, after a few months, escaped to Vienna, where Georg Joseph Beer's teaching first interested him in ophthalmic surgery. He returned to Edinburgh, and was admitted FRCS (Edinburgh) in 1804. He practised surgery there for a time, studying especially pathology and diseases of the eye, and was active in the formation of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>As there was no immediate opening for Wardrop in Edinburgh, he went to London in April 1808; he first took rooms in York Street, and then rented 2 Charles Street, St James's Square, where he lived until his death. He married, in 1813, Margaret, a daughter of Colonel George Dalrymple, a lineal descendant of the earl of Stair, and they had four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In London Wardrop was admitted MRCS without examination in 1814, the master, Sir Everard Home, saying that Wardrop's published works were quite sufficient to entitle him to the diploma. He became FRCS (England) in 1843; the honorary degree of MD had been conferred upon him by the University of St Andrews in 1834. In September 1818 he was appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the prince regent, and in 1823, when the latter visited Scotland as George IV, he attended him on the journey.<br>
<br>Wardrop had practised for many years among the poor by giving advice chiefly at his own house. In 1826, with William Willocks Sleigh, he founded a hospital in Nutford Place, Edgware Road, called the West London Hospital of Surgery. It was not only a charitable institution, but it was free to every member of the medical profession. On one day each week operations of importance were done and a clinical discussion followed. The hospital's expenses were met mainly by Wardrop, who reluctantly had to close it at the end of ten years.<br>
<br>In 1826 Wardrop and William Lawrence gave a course of lectures on surgery at the Aldersgate Street school of medicine, and after Lawrence went to St Bartholomew's Hospital, Wardrop for a few seasons gave these lectures alone. He joined the Great Windmill Street School as a lecturer on surgery about 1835.<br>
<br>Wardrop took a leading part in the discussions on the state of the medical profession, and he was an active supporter of the liberal policy advocated by Thomas Wakley. In 1825&#150;6 <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> published a series of letters from Wardrop, written under the pen name of Brutus, which attacked the way the College of Surgeons was organized. Wardrop also quarrelled with Robert Liston over bloodletting, Liston saying that patients should lose as little blood as possible, Wardrop the opposite.<br>
<br>Wardrop succeeded Astley Cooper as surgeon-in-ordinary to the king in 1828, and he declined a baronetcy shortly afterwards. Circumstances which occurred during the last illness of George IV convinced Wardrop that he was unfairly treated by several of his medical colleagues who were attached to the court, and after the king's death in 1830 he avoided their circles. Indeed, he took the matter much to heart, and exacted revenge by writing a series of anonymous &#145;Intercepted letters&#146; for <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. They claimed to contain confidential details of events communicated by Henry Halford, Benjamin Collins Brodie, and William MacMichael, librarian of the Royal College of Physicians. Scurrilous though they are, they are well written and amusing. However, when it leaked out that Wardrop was the author he was &#145;regarded as a &#147;pariah&#148; by men who could do much either to benefit or ruin him&#146;  (Clarke, 338), and he lost much of his practice.<br>
<br>Wardrop was celebrated not as an operator but as a diagnostician and a medical writer, and it is both as a surgeon cardiologist and as an ophthalmologist that he is remembered. He was, however, the first surgeon in England to remove a tumour of the lower jaw by total vertical section of the bone, and he carried out and modified Pierre Brasdor's operation for peripheral aneurysm (blood-filled sac) by distal ligature&#151;that is, by tying the artery on the side of the aneurysm farthest from the heart (<span class="italic">On Aneurysm</span>, 1828). His treatise <span class="italic">On the Nature and Treatment of Diseases of the Heart</span> (1837, 1851) was never regarded as authoritative, but his ophthalmic works show &#145;shrewdness and enthusiasm &hellip; and testify to the brilliance of their author&#146;  (Albert and Robinson, 907). In sympathetic ophthalmitis, the germ of the idea of prophylactic enucleation of the eye to prevent the spread to the unaffected eye came from Wardrop, who had veterinary experience of the disease in horses and had treated the prince regent's horse. Wardrop himself had an exotropic left eye (wall eye). He coined the term &#145;keratitis&#146; for inflammation of the cornea, and had a partial understanding of glaucoma. His publications in ophthalmology included his two-volume <span class="italic">Essays on the Morbid Anatomy of the Human Eye</span> (3 edns, 1808&#150;34), a work on eye diseases of the horse (1819), and two papers. Wardrop also edited the works of Matthew Baillie in 1825, and prefixed to it a biographical sketch of the author.<br>
<br>A tall, thin man, Wardrop was vain and self-opinionated, and fond of scandal and gossip. However, his social gifts, family connections, knowledge of horses, and love of field sports brought him both friendly acquaintance and patients from the aristocracy. He collected art, though much of his collection was sold later in his life. He died at his house, 2 Charles Street, St James's Square, on 13 February 1869 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
