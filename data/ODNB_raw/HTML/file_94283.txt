<span class="headword">Barber,  John Norman Romney</span>  (1919&#150;2004), <span class="occ">motor industry executive</span>, was born on 22 April 1919 at 24 Cranleigh Drive, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, the son of George Ernest Barber, master builder, and Gladys Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tassie. He was educated at Westcliff high school, Westcliff-on-Sea, and read economics at London University until he left to join the army at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He became an officers' training instructor stationed in Wales and Dorset and rose to the rank of captain. On 15 March 1941 he married Babette Chalu (1917/18&#150;2003), who had been born in France and who was the daughter of Louis Chalu, a works manager; the couple had one son.<br>
<br>For nine years after the war Barber worked for the Ministry of Supply. In 1956 he joined the finance department of the Ford Motor Company as an assistant controller with a brief to modernize. Barber described what he found as &#145;an almost green eye-shade operation&#146;  (private information) that had hardly changed since the 1930s. He began by spending six weeks in the United States identifying and observing modern financial systems that would later make Ford UK hugely successful. On his return to England he began the Ford graduate scheme, which recruited 100 university leavers in a year and became a well-known and respected nursery for management talent for Ford and other companies. In 1962 Barber became finance director but left the company three years later, uncomfortable at what he saw as the creeping Americanization of British operations. He now moved, again as finance director, to Associated Electrical Industries (AEI), and was once more charged with reorganizing the company. In 1967 AEI was the subject of a successful takeover bid by Arnold Weinstock's General Electric Company (GEC), despite an energetic defence of AEI in which Barber played a key role. &#145;You cost me&#146;, complained Weinstock  (private information).<br>
<br>GEC's takeover of AEI was one of two big restructurings encouraged by Harold Wilson's Labour government as part of its bid to modernize and rationalize Britain's industrial economy. Barber was soon in the thick of the second restructuring, the proposed merger of Leyland Motors with British Motor Holdings (BMH), the floundering agglomeration of Austin, Morris, and more recently Jaguar. Having declined Arnold Weinstock's offer of a job with GEC, Barber was invited to return to the car industry by Leyland's chairman, Sir Donald Stokes, an industrialist favoured by the Labour government for his success with the export of buses and trucks. Barber recalled how Stokes&#151;the consummate salesman&#151;had told Harold Wilson of his plan, only to be asked for details by the prime minister. &#145;Stokes came back at eleven o'clock and said, &#147;John, I have to have a plan for taking over and rationalizing BMH for four o'clock&#148;&#146;  (private information). Barber duly obliged and in 1968 he became director of finance and planning at the newly created British Leyland Motor Corporation.<br>
<br>In the late 1960s the new motor company ranked tenth in the world. However, Barber&#151;his cerebral manner offset by a boyish enthusiasm for cars and a delight in the latest engineering&#151;was alert to British Leyland's flaws. As numerous working parties set out to establish consensus about anything from pensions to products, he was horrified to find &#145;a mass of unrationalised production plants and products, umpteen engines, umpteen gearboxes, umpteen axles&#146;  (Adeney, 257). Barber blamed the company's midland management for allowing the workforce to get out of control. While at Ford, it had been customary for Barber and other executives to compare their own lines with rival models across Europe; this practice was absent at British Leyland and from this Barber identified a basic lack of interest in cars from a management obsessed with production difficulties. As one of British Leyland's two deputy managing directors from 1971, Barber worked and competed with the other, George Turnbull, who was responsible for the company's largest division, Austin-Morris, at Longbridge in Birmingham. Turnbull's overriding concern was to start earning revenue from the plant's new models, and feared that imminent business rationalization or redundancies would prevent this. Other powerful barons at this time included Sir George Farmer of Rover and Sir Bill Lyons of Jaguar, who both sought to maintain their independence within the company. Barber saw himself as a champion of coherent planning. His midland colleagues, by contrast, criticized him for trying to impose Fordist constraints within Leyland and so restrict autonomy in a company characterized by diversity. In this climate Barber struggled to rationalize and to make the company more outward-looking, and sought to make his point on competition by, on one occasion, lining up a selection of rival continental marques outside a top management meeting. Progress was made and new mass-market cars did emerge, although only after strikes had cost &pound;15 million in six weeks. Even then, the new Marina and Allegro models proved unpopular and sold less well than the cars they replaced.<br>
<br>Barber saw British Leyland's long-term salvation as being the upmarket Rover and Jaguar lines. He battled to prevent George Turnbull forming a cars division which would include specialist as well as mass-market marques&#151;a mistake made under the company's later managers. Turnbull saw Barber's resistance as a threat to the autonomy of his division and, while praising the financial control systems introduced by Barber and his former Ford colleagues, also criticized his rival for an excessive zeal to merge the business. It was Turnbull's opinion that putting tractors and buses under the same management as cars would not work. In 1973 Barber was appointed deputy chairman and managing director, and so became the heir presumptive to Stokes (now Baron Stokes). Turnbull resigned in September 1973. But time was also running out for British Leyland's senior management. Stokes's consensual style had failed to grip the enlarged company in the way that Arnold Weinstock had welded GEC. The 1973 oil crisis devastated the market for cars; managers were wearied by serial industrial unrest (which led to a production loss of more than 150,000 cars in 1974), and the group started to run out of working capital.<br>
<br>Barber's view always remained that a relatively small injection of cash&#151;perhaps &pound;100 million&#151;would have enabled British Leyland to pull through. With the company almost bankrupt in the summer of 1974, Harold Wilson's new Labour government initially provided emergency funding but then lost confidence. In June 1975 the government nationalized British Leyland after receiving from Lord Ryder of Eaton Hastings, chairman of the National Enterprise Board, a report on the company's current situation and proposals for its future. Stokes and Barber were ignored during the investigation, and Ryder's plans&#151;which Barber considered hopelessly optimistic&#151;were prepared without their involvement. Under its terms, &pound;1400 million was poured in with much of the spending, in Barber's opinion, being directed to the wrong sectors. In his report Ryder criticized Barber for having undermined &#145;the authority and responsibility of line management by having too many people reporting to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Leyland: the Next Decade</span>, 1975). Despite receiving the support of the House of Commons' public expenditure committee, which declared that the British motor industry could not &#145;afford to lose the able managers it possesses&#146;, there was to be no place for Barber in a newly nationalized British Leyland. He refused to resign, maintaining that it was his job to get the best possible deal for the company's shareholders. As a result on 14 August 1975 Barber was dismissed. He took his sacking badly: his wife complained to the press while he wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to justify his record, claiming that his large team was only temporary and that he had not been given sufficient time to make an impact.<br>
<br>John Barber spent the rest of his career in a series of lesser non-executive positions, firmly of the belief that once he had been black-balled by the government, big companies would not take a chance on him. None the less he made a series of profitable investments in smaller companies which manufactured car seats, exhibition stands, and other products, and enjoyed his role as a hands-on manager. To his admirers, the loss of Barber's undoubted talent for analysis and management was a tragedy for the domestic motor industry. It is equally the case that the problems faced by British Leyland in the early to mid-1970s were too complex and politically charged for a purely business solution to be effective. The company was perhaps beyond salvation by the time he became managing director. Certainly Barber lacked the subtlety and the human and political touch required to attempt a rescue. Despite his departure from British Leyland, Barber retained his fascination with motor cars and motor racing. In his sixties he was happy to bend people's ears on the engineering merits of his own Honda car and took as a badge of honour Lord Stokes's claim that he had been the one car nut on the Leyland board. John Barber died on 21 October 2004 at Southampton General Hospital from pneumonia; his wife, Babette, predeceased him in 2003 and he was survived by their son.<br>
