<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corbet,  Matthew Ridley</span>  (1850&#150;1902), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 20 May 1850 at South Willingham, Lincolnshire, the son of the Revd Andrew Corbet and his wife, Marianne Ridley, through whom he was descended from the Ridleys of Blagdon, Northumberland. Educated at Cheltenham College, Corbet was originally intended for a military career. Instead, he was apprenticed to Alexander Davis Cooper, a painter of landscape and literary subjects. Corbet studied art at Heatherley's School of Art and at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, where he was among the first intake of students. He then went on to the Royal Academy Schools. Corbet worked at first as a portraitist, influenced by the example of George Frederic Watts; portraits by him appeared at the Royal Academy summer exhibitions during the second half of the 1870s. Later in his career he seems to have restricted himself to painting friends, his last exhibited portrait being a likeness of the painter Walter Maclaren, shown at the Royal Academy in 1889; in the 1890s he made portraits of members of the family of the amateur artist George Howard, ninth earl of Carlisle.<br>
<br>Corbet spent a period of years away from England during the first half of the 1880s, devoting himself to landscape painting. In 1880 he travelled to Egypt, where he made oil sketches of the desert. By the winter of 1880&#150;81 he was established in Rome, living at via di San Basilio 20 and joining a group of young artists in the city which included the sculptor Alfred Gilbert and the American painter Elihu Vedder. In Rome Corbet soon encountered the Italian painter Giovanni Costa, from whom he learned how to refine his landscape compositions by the use of subdued and harmonious colour. In the winter of 1883&#150;4 Corbet was one of the group of painters of different nationalities&#151;all of whom revered Costa&#151;who formed the so-called Etruscan school. Later, Corbet's paintings were shown with those of Costa at the exhibitions &#145;In arte libertas&#146;.<br>
<br>Although the city of Rome and the Roman Campagna were Corbet's favourite painting grounds in the first half of the 1880s, he also made painting expeditions into the south, joining the community of artists that formed around Charles Caryl Coleman at Capri about 1882, and to the countryside near Perugia, where he shared a rented farm house with Gilbert and his family. In 1885 Costa settled at Bocca d'Arno in Tuscany. Corbet made frequent visits to Costa, staying with him or lodging at the Albergo Ascani at Marina di Pisa. Over the following years Corbet made a thorough exploration of the countryside of the coastal plain between Leghorn and Viareggio, as well as of the hills inland around Volterra and to the north of Lucca. That Corbet knew how to capture the characteristic effects of the Italian countryside in a delightful way was commented on by an obituarist:<blockquote>His knowledge of Italy is not that of a tourist; it is that of a poet-painter, whose imagination is stirred by the cadence of the hills, the magic of dark cypresses silhouetted against the evening sky, the elusive beauty of olive-clad slopes, the &#145;temper&#146; of that country whose every valley, as mists steal silently across, is charged with memories. (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 93)</blockquote>From about the mid-1880s Corbet seems to have established a pattern of life between Italy and London. In the winter months he occupied a studio in The Avenue, off the Fulham Road. He had probably first met Sir Coutts Lindsay&#151;the proprietor of the Grosvenor Gallery&#151;in Rome, and from 1880 he was invited to send works to the Grosvenor summer exhibitions. In 1888 he transferred to the New Gallery, along with other progressive painters at the time when the Grosvenor was seen to be losing its position as the most interesting of the London summer exhibitions. In 1889 he won a bronze medal for his painting <span class="italic">Sunrise</span> at the Paris Universal Exhibition. Corbet was also a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, from where two of his landscapes, <span class="italic">Morning Glory</span> (one of a small number of English landscapes by Corbet) and <span class="italic">Val d'Arno</span>, were bought by the trustees of the Chantrey bequest, in 1894 and 1901 respectively (both Tate collection). In January 1902 Corbet was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1891 Corbet married Edith Jane Murch, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edenborough (<i>b</i>. 1846/7), the widow of the painter Arthur Murch and herself a landscape painter and an Italophile. They lived together in London at 54 Circus Road, St John's Wood, and it was there that Corbet died on 25 June 1902, following an attack of pleuro-pneumonia. His wife survived him, and his ashes were later taken to South Willingham.<br>
