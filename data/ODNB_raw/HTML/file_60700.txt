<span class="headword">Shelton,  Jerome</span>  (<em>c.</em>1500&#150;1555<span class="mult">x</span>60), <span class="occ">property speculator and royal official</span>, was a younger son of Nicholas Shelton (<i>d</i>. 1515), resident in the parish of St Thomas of Acon, London, freeman and master of the Mercers' Company, and sheriff and alderman of London, and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Rawlins, a London mercer. Nicholas Shelton was a first-generation Londoner, a junior member of a prominent gentry family of Norfolk. At unknown dates, probably early in Jerome Shelton's career, he was admitted to the freedom of London in the right of his father, and admitted to membership of the Middle Temple. However, he does not appear to have carried on a settled trade, nor did he practise law. Instead, his career centred upon activities as a bondsman, moneylender, property speculator, and exchequer official. He was associated in many of his financial transactions with his three brothers from his father's second marriage, William, Thomas, and Robert, and, initially, his stepfather, Sir Humphrey Brown, serjeant-at-law and later a judge of common pleas.<br>
<br>As early as 1534 Shelton was speculating in property, at Westminster, with his brother William. In 1538 he secured his co-appointment for life with Brown as steward of all the property of Waltham Abbey in Essex, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Surrey. This grant appears to have been sought as an investment in anticipation of the dissolution of the abbey, and in July 1540 Shelton and Brown surrendered their patent to the court of augmentations in return for a life pension of &pound;20 p.a. In 1539 he leased land and secured an annuity of &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from the last prioress of St Helen's Priory outside Bishopsgate, London, the house in which his half-sister, Mary, was a nun; the grants were subsequently recognized by the crown. The Waltham Abbey enterprise ended in acrimony as Shelton and Brown fell out over the division of the pension and their 1546 administratorship of the sizeable estate of Shelton's uncle, William Rawlins, provost of Wells.<br>
<br>In 1539 Shelton also sub-let the former monastic property of Flitcham, Norfolk, from a family associate, Sir William Hollis, lord mayor of London, for thirty years. His efforts at rack-renting the manor produced political strife in the county and in 1541 led to the mediation of the Shelton family patron, Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk. Shelton withdrew with financial loss, but he soon thereafter did acquire the office of a tellership of the exchequer, on 18 January 1542, through Howard's patronage as lord treasurer of England. He held this office until 1555 and engaged in the practice of using his cash reserves of crown money for private speculation in the London money and commodities markets. He also, more controversially, exploited his office to avoid paying his own tax assessments, and he used his legal right as an exchequer official to be sued only in the exchequer of pleas to force litigants to contest cases on unfavourable ground. During the 1540s his speculations in the popular market in the lead stripped from the monastic houses led to significant debts owed to the crown. When he vacated his tellership in 1555, he owed another &pound;2590 on his accounts. Most of this sum was never recovered by the state, and the debt wiped out any gains he enjoyed elsewhere, impoverishing his estate.<br>
<br>For much of his adult life Shelton resided in the parish of St Helen, London. His last years and death are obscure. Because he died intestate, his widow, identified only as Alice Hering, secured letters of administration on 28 February 1561. Already, on the preceding 28 May, the crown had excused her of all claims which it had on Shelton's estate. No record of children of the marriage has been located and the principal beneficiary of Shelton's tenure in the exchequer was a nephew, Humphrey Shelton, an Elizabethan officer of the receipt. Overall, Shelton's financial failures appear to have been the direct consequence of high-risk speculative investments, and loans. Ambitious, and one of the most litigious individuals of his generation, he alienated and exploited many members of his own immediate family, including his sister, Katherine Townshend. His career reveals the opportunities and liabilities of life as an unscrupulous mid-Tudor entrepreneur. Many individuals attempted to profit from the dissolution of the monasteries and a period of lax government administration. Shelton's misfortunes in this quest for material benefit can be attributed to his own overreaching ambition.<br>
