<span class="headword">Clarke,  Dudley Wrangel</span>  (1899&#150;1974), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Johannesburg on 27 April 1899, the elder son and eldest of four children of Sir Ernest Michael Clarke, businessman, of Oxted, Surrey, and his wife, Madeline Sidonia Louisa, daughter of Edward Bennett Gardiner, general manager of the Standard Bank of South Africa and later of Carse Grange, Errol. He was educated at Charterhouse School from 1912 to 1915, and in May 1916 entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In November 1916 he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) and went as conducting officer to France. On his return to England he joined the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and in October 1917 he was posted to the School of Military Aeronautics, Reading, where he flew DH6s and Avro monoplanes. From April 1918 he served with the RFC in Egypt until returning to Britain in January 1919. He was promoted lieutenant (aeroplanes) in July 1919, but two months later transferred back to the RFA.<br>
<br>In November 1919 Clarke was posted to Mesopotamia. While on leave in 1922 he went on the grand tour, and when war between Britain and Turkey threatened he reported to the British commander in Constantinople, who employed him on special missions. In 1924 (again on leave) he spent two months as <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> correspondent covering the Riff rebellion in Morocco. In 1926 he became adjutant to the Territorial Army and in 1927 adjutant to the 98th Surrey and Sussex yeomanry. He joined the Transjordan force in 1930. He qualified for the Staff College, Camberley, at his fourth attempt thanks to the 1932 Middle East command course for Staff College candidates where (in his words) &#145;the whole thing became plain and simple&#146; as a result of instruction by B. L. Montgomery. In 1932 he was captain in the 18th battery, 3rd field brigade. He attended the Staff College in 1933&#150;4, visiting Germany and Italy, the college exercise having been changed from the Far East to a European war in alliance with France. He was posted at his own request to Aden in 1935 and served in Palestine in 1936&#150;8. Having been promoted major in 1938, he became a deputy assistant military secretary in the War Office and lieutenant-colonel in the following year.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Seven Assignments</span> (1948) Clarke described his early tasks in the Second World War, the principal ones being: reconnoitring a route from Mombasa to reinforce Egypt lest the Mediterranean be closed; two assignments to Norway in April 1940; visiting a neutral country to ensure its continued neutrality; and, most important, the creation of the commandos. On 4 June 1940 the prime minister approved a scheme for small raiding forces put forward by Clarke which his experience of guerrilla warfare in Palestine well qualified him to implement. He recruited volunteers mainly from the &#145;independent companies&#146; which had served in Norway under Colin Gubbins; and a mere three weeks after their formation 200 commandos raided the coast between Boulogne and Berck. Clarke accompanied them but was ordered not to go ashore.<br>
<br>In the late summer of 1940 Clarke was posted to the staff of Sir A. P. Wavell in the Middle East, where he set up &#145;A&#146; Force, the deception organization. It played a vital part in allied victories in spite of the fact that large-scale deception was a new element in strategy and that Clarke's plans were at first hindered by Wavell's insistence on absolute secrecy. To his colleagues he was a meticulous professional endowed with great energy, and above all with the imagination needed to see into the minds of the enemy intelligence staffs and to induce them to advise their high command to do what best suited the allies. The misleading clues he scattered round the Mediterranean theatre led the enemy to overestimate allied strength there by nearly a quarter of a million men and tied down troops which otherwise might have been used to resist the allied invasion of Normandy. He thus blazed a trail successfully followed by the sister organizations of Colonel John Bevan in London and Lieutenant-Colonel R. Peter Fleming in the Far East. Like them he suffered the fate of men engaged in secret work: their contribution is unnoticed except by a few &#145;in the know&#146; whose vow of secrecy prevents them from paying tribute even long after the event. Besides, Clarke resisted the temptation to commit to paper his secret wartime experiences for financial gain. Earl Alexander of Tunis believed that Clarke had done as much to win the war as any other single officer, a view substantiated by the official history of &#145;A&#146; Force.<br>
<br>Clarke, promoted colonel in 1942 and brigadier in 1943, retired from the army in 1947. From 1948 to 1952 he was head of public opinion research in the Conservative central office, and was for a time a director of Securicor Ltd. He was appointed OBE in 1942, CBE in 1943, and CB in 1945, and he was awarded the American Legion of Merit. He died in London on 7 May 1974. He was unmarried.<br>
