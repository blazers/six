<span class="headword">Lyon, Sir  John</span>, lord of Glamis  (<em>d.</em> 1382), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, is of obscure origins. Chroniclers writing early in the sixteenth century deliberately emphasized his supposed lowly origins and claimed that he had originally been called John Myll and had received the surname Lyon from Robert II as an indication of, and reward for, his service to that monarch. An origin in the north-east of the kingdom, perhaps Angus, may be indicated by his steady accumulation of territorial interests in this area. He emerges into the light of historical record on 9 July 1368, when he had a grant of lands in the lordship of the Garioch from David II. It seems likely that Lyon had already entered royal service by the date of this grant. In April 1369 King David gave him a lifetime right to receive 10 merks from every justice ayre north of the Forth. In the same year Lyon was paid for his expenses in undertaking a diplomatic mission to London, where he was identified as the keeper of the king's privy seal. In January 1370 he was acting as an auditor of exchequer and by February of the following year he was serving as King David's secretary, an office which probably also included the keepership of the privy seal. Quite clearly, he was a highly literate and well-educated layman.<br>
<br>After the death of his royal patron on 22 February 1371 Lyon retained an important role in the administration of the new king, Robert II. He was confirmed as keeper of the privy seal by 3 May 1371 and continued in that office until 1377. Similarly, the flow of direct royal patronage to him was unaffected by the change in regime. One of the most significant honours occurred in March 1372, when he was granted the royal thanage of Glamis by King Robert in free barony. Thereafter John was occasionally styled lord of Glamis. He was also the beneficiary of grants from a number of other noblemen, probably a reflection of his ability and his influence in royal government.<br>
<br>Lyon's steady progression through the royal administration became a meteoric social and political rise during 1377. By 2 October 1377 he had married Johanna Stewart, daughter of Robert II and widow of Sir John Keith, son of Sir William Keith, the marischal, who had died shortly before 27 December 1375. The couple received the royal thanage of Tannadice through the marriage settlement. Perhaps as part of his elevation to the status of a royal son-in-law, Lyon was knighted, on a date between 27 June 1376 and 2 October 1377. Finally, on 20 October 1377, he was appointed chamberlain (the chief royal financial officer) in succession to Walter Biggar (<i>d</i>. 1376) and John Mercer, who had acted as a temporary collector and receiver of royal revenues in the immediate aftermath of Biggar's death. Lyon's domination of key royal posts was further extended before February 1380 to include the sheriffdom of Edinburgh with custody of the castle, offices for which he was given a fee specially augmented by his royal father-in-law.<br>
<br>Lyon's rapid rise to a privileged and influential position at the heart of royal government and his personal territorial aggrandizement seem to have aroused considerable resentment. The circumstances of his marriage to the king's daughter, in particular, may have given cause for concern. Certainly, on 10 May 1378 Robert II was required to issue a remission to his &#145;beloved son&#146; John Lyon and his daughter for their clandestine marriage, a concession ratified by Johanna's brothers John, earl of Carrick (the future Robert III), Robert, earl of Fife, and Alexander, lord of Badenoch. The idea that Lyon's marriage to Johanna and his subsequent social elevation were not universally popular resurfaced in later tales surrounding his death.<br>
<br>Lyon was assassinated on 4 November 1382 by another prominent royal councillor, Sir James Lindsay, lord of Crawford, whose family had experienced a number of political setbacks during 1382, and who may well have held the influential Lyon responsible for the direction of royal policy. Lyon's role in the creation of Robert II's son Alexander as earl of Buchan in 1382, a title to which Lindsay also had a claim, may have been crucial, although the steady territorial build-up of Lyon's interests in Angus, an area dominated by Crawford's Lindsay kinsmen, perhaps also played a part. Sixteenth-century chroniclers suggest that Lindsay's assassination of Lyon arose from Sir John's ingratitude to Lindsay after the latter, a close friend, had secured a place for Lyon in Robert II's government and protected the chamberlain from the king's wrath after Lyon had been seduced by Princess Johanna.<br>
<br>Lyon is said to have been buried in Scone Abbey, a traditional site for the coronation and burial of Scottish monarchs; if this is correct, it gives some indication of the regard in which he was held by his royal father-in-law. After his death his widow went on to marry, between 20 November 1384 and 24 May 1385, Sir James Sandilands of Calder. The last reference to her occurs in 1404, when she was styled lady of Glamis. She is reputed to have been buried at Scone. Lyon and Johanna had one son, also John, whose son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54275/', "Patrick Lyon")</script> was created Lord Glamis in 1445.<br>
