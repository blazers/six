<span class="headword">Malmesbury,  William  of</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1090, <em>d.</em> in or after 1142), <span class="occ">historian, man of letters, and Benedictine monk</span>, spent his whole life from boyhood as a monk of his order's ancient foundation at Malmesbury.<h2>
<a name="ThemonkofMalmesbury"></a>The monk of Malmesbury</h2>Almost all that is known of William of Malmesbury derives from his own writings; even the dates of his birth and death are not easily determined. In his commentary on <span class="roman">Lamentations</span>, written soon after 1135, William describes himself as <i>quadrigenarius</i>. If this means &#145;in my forties&#146; rather than &#145;forty&#146;, it would allow him to have been born as early as the late 1080s, to have witnessed and remembered a local &#145;miracle&#146; which occurred before 1096, and to be of sufficiently mature years when he attracted royal recognition and began to write his major historical works, between 1100 and 1118. He was still alive late in 1142, when his <span class="italic">Historia novella</span> terminates. Earlier he had said that he intended to chronicle contemporary history as long as life remained to him, and this statement, and the work's abrupt ending, suggest that it was broken off by his death. Although he nowhere says so, he was clearly brought up not far from Malmesbury. &#145;The blood of two races&#146;&#151;Norman and English&#151;was mingled in William, and that is all he has to say of his parentage and family. His father may have been the Norman partner and was certainly a man of means. William says that his father encouraged his youthful studies, meaning perhaps that he financed private tuition for his son in the first instance.<br>
<br>Whether William studied later on at Malmesbury or another religious house, he does not say. Malmesbury seems unlikely, since William is dismissive of learning there before the abbacy of <a name="cosubject_10863"></a><span class="headword">Godfrey  of Jumi&egrave;ges</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1106)<span class="occ"></span>. According to William, Godfrey had earlier been a monk of Jumi&egrave;ges, which would suggest that he was Norman. But the matter is complicated. The <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> describes him as a local monk who became proctor at Ely following the death of Abbot Theodwin <i>c</i>.1075&#150;6. This position he filled with ability for seven or eight years until 1082, obtaining from William I a confirmation of the abbey's liberties. The <span class="italic">Liber</span> then has him transferred to Malmesbury at the end of this term. But Malmesbury records make it certain that he only became abbot there between 1087 and January 1091. It is therefore possible, either that he came to Ely from Jumi&egrave;ges, perhaps in the company of Theodwin who certainly was a monk of that place, or that he moved from Ely to Jumi&egrave;ges for a few years after 1082, moving on to Malmesbury from there. The former would be the more usual pattern.<br>
<br>At Malmesbury, Godfrey was a vigorous reformer of monastic life and learning: he adorned the church as much as limited resources would permit, and laid the foundations of a library; William describes how the monks, scarcely able to stammer their way through texts in the vernacular, now became competent in Latin. The monastery's reputation grew throughout England, and miracles occurred at its shrine of St Aldhelm. Godfrey died about 1106. William describes him as a man of courteous manners and temperate life, whose abbacy was sullied only by his stripping the treasures of the monastery to pay the tax imposed by William Rufus on the occasion of the mortgage of Normandy by Duke Robert. Tanner supposed Godfrey to have been the author of a chronicle in British Library, Cotton MS Vespasian D.iv (fifteenth century), but this is nothing other than part of the annals of Alfred of Beverley (<i>fl</i>. 1143), itself almost entirely based on the <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span> of Geoffrey of Monmouth (<i>d</i>. 1155). The name Godfridus de Malvesbery in the manuscript is presumably that of an owner, not of the writer.<h2>
<a name="Thescholarandhisoutlook"></a>The scholar and his outlook</h2>William was a monk at Malmesbury under Godfrey, and assisted the abbot in building up its library. He gives a valuable outline of his own course of studies:<blockquote>I studied many kinds of literature, though in different degrees. To logic, the armourer of speech, I no more than lent an ear. Physic, which cures the sick body, I went deeper into. As for ethics, I explored parts in depth, revering its high status as a subject inherently accessible to the student and able to form good character; in particular I studied history, which adds flavour to moral instruction by imparting a pleasurable knowledge of past events, spurring the reader by the accumulation of examples to follow the good and shun the bad. (Malmesbury, <span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 2, prologue)</blockquote>This is the programme ascribed to Plato by St Augustine, standard in the West until superseded by the fourfold &#145;Aristotelian&#146; scheme in the twelfth century. It was therefore rather old-fashioned by William's time. One area within it, logic, had indeed become western Europe's new intellectual obsession, but even that was not one of William's major interests; he was not being overly modest in describing his acquaintance with it as passing.<br>
<br>Like Bede (<i>d</i>. 735), his great hero and exemplar, William had no career to speak of. He entered Malmesbury Abbey perhaps as a child, certainly no more than a teenager, and there spent the rest of his life. By the 1120s he was cantor (precentor), in charge of the liturgy as well as effectively librarian. Further promotion he apparently shunned; in 1140 he was offered and refused the abbacy: &#145;Unless self-love deceives me&#146;, he wrote soon after, &#145;I have proved myself a man of ingenuous mind, in that I gave place to a comrade in the matter of the abbot's office, which I might easily have obtained for myself, more than once&#146;  (Leland, <span class="italic">De rebus Britannicis</span>, 3.272). He represented his abbey at councils held at Winchester in 1139 and 1141, and that is the sum total of his known public activity. As far as is known, only one person outside the abbey wrote about William during his lifetime: Robert of Cricklade (<i>d</i>. 1174), canon of Cirencester, who praises him as a writer of devotional works.<h2>
<a name="Thewritingofhistory"></a>The writing of history</h2>It is not for his uneventful life, then, that William is remembered, but for his scholarship. Of the genesis of his historical writing he himself says:<blockquote>After I had spent a good deal of my own money on getting together a library of foreign historians, I proceeded in my leisure moments to inquire if anything could be discovered concerning England worth the attention of posterity. Not content with ancient works, I began to get the itch to write myself, not to show off my more or less non-existent erudition but in order to bring forcibly into the light things lost in the rubbish-heap of the past. Feeling an aversion to fleeting opinion, I collected chronicles from far and wide&#151;almost, I confess, to no purpose: for when I had gone through them all I remained ignorant, not finding anything to read before I ceased to feel the urge to read it. (Malmesbury, <span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 2, prologue)</blockquote>This suggests that he was self-motivated, but there was more to it than that. Some time before her death in 1118 Queen Matilda visited Malmesbury, and while there asked for a written account of the connection between the English royal family and the abbey's founder St Aldhelm (<i>d</i>. 709/10). This was the genesis of what was to be William's most popular and influential work, the <span class="italic">Gesta regum Anglorum</span>, a full-scale history of England from the death of Bede in 735 until his own day. He says that some of it was written before the queen's death; thereafter he put it aside until the urging of friends caused him to begin again. It was completed <i>c</i>.1125&#150;6, but until at least 1134 William continued to revise it spasmodically, mainly to improve it stylistically, with one notable exception. Shortly after the last date he produced a version that incorporated substantial portions from another of his historical works written in the meantime, <span class="italic">De antiquitate Glastonie ecclesie</span>. This work of local history had been commissioned by the monastic community there, and presumably the version of the <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> that included so much of it was specially designed for the same audience. But almost simultaneously William produced what he may have seen as the &#145;final&#146; version of the <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> for a wider audience, with the Glastonbury material pruned back again, and some revisions of judgement in the direction of greater prudence and moderation.<br>
<br>Queen Matilda may have encouraged William to embark on such an ambitious project because he was already active as a historian, engaged on his earliest known work, a remarkable version of the <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span>, the history of the popes, which was finished soon after 1119.<br>
<br>Throughout the decade <i>c</i>.1125&#150;35 William was astonishingly prolific as a historian, especially considering how little time was available to a Benedictine monk for such activity. The <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> was mainly concerned with secular political history, but as it neared completion William began work on a companion piece of similar scale, the <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum Anglorum</span>, a church history of England. This too was finished <i>c</i>.1125 and revised at intervals over the next decade. As if this were not enough, William visited Glastonbury soon after 1129, and there wrote first the lives of its local saints, Patrick, Dunstan, Indract, and Benignus, and then his famous historical monograph, the <span class="italic">De antiquitate Glastonie ecclesie</span>. The honesty about the abbey's claims to great antiquity displayed in this work did not satisfy the local monks, and it survives today only in a heavily revised form. Some time between <i>c</i>.1125 and 1142 William wrote the life of St Wulfstan for the monks of Worcester.<h2>
<a name="Travellingandresearching"></a>Travelling and researching</h2>All this historical activity must have necessitated some relaxation of the Benedictine rule. There was not merely the time and labour of writing. William had to conduct research, to read and transcribe books and documents at religious houses up and down the country. He was probably at Canterbury (both Christ Church and St Augustine's), Glastonbury, and Worcester more than once; otherwise he records visits to St Frideswide's, Oxford, Thorney, St Ives, Bury St Edmunds, Rochester, Sherborne, Crowland, Hereford, York, Carlisle, Shaftesbury, Bath, Wareham, Corfe, Gloucester, Bangor, Coventry, Winchester, Milton Abbas, and perhaps Tavistock. There is a strong possibility that he crossed the channel into Normandy. William is reticent about his circle of acquaintance, but his travels and historical activity must have brought him friendships, and some can be inferred: Eadmer (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1126) and Alexander, monks of Canterbury and disciples of St Anselm (<i>d</i>. 1109), John, monk and chronicler at Worcester (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1140), and Nicholas, the prior there, Walcher, prior of Malvern (<i>d</i>. 1135), interested in astronomy, Faricius, abbot of Abingdon (<i>d</i>. 1117), formerly a monk of Malmesbury and biographer of its patron St Aldhelm.<br>
<br>It seems inconceivable that William did not hold conversations with the other great contemporary historian Orderic Vitalis (<i>d</i>. 1142), monk of St Evroult, either in Normandy or England; there is too much overlap of content and interest between their historical writings to be coincidental. As to the powers in the land, it has already been observed that Queen Matilda started William on his way as a historian; he eventually sent copies of the <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> to her brother David, king of Scots, and to her daughter, the Empress Matilda. But the work itself bore a much more personal dedication to Robert, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1147), bastard son of Henry I. William had access to Henry's private zoo at Woodstock, which suggests that he knew the king himself, although he does not acknowledge any particular relationship. Two great ecclesiastics, Henry de Blois (<i>d</i>. 1171), simultaneously bishop of Winchester and abbot of Glastonbury, and Roger, bishop of Salisbury and abbot of Malmesbury itself (<i>d</i>. 1139), complete what is known of William's circle of acquaintance.<h2>
<a name="Nonhistoricalwritings"></a>Non-historical writings</h2>After this long period of immersion in historical writing William's conscience seems to have troubled him. He says as much in the prologue to his commentary on <span class="roman">Lamentations</span>, and about this time he produced a series of works more obviously relevant to the needs and aspirations of a monastic community, his own as well as others. Apart from the commentary itself he wrote a set of miracles of the Virgin and made digests of basic texts to make them more accessible to less gifted monks: the works of St Gregory (<span class="italic">Defloratio Gregorii</span>) and the liturgical writing of Amalarius of Metz (<span class="italic">Abbreviatio Amalarii</span>). But he could not stay away from history for long. About 1140 he began the <span class="italic">Historia novella</span>, a continuation of the <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> from 1135. Yet he never adequately covered the decade of English history from <i>c</i>.1125 to <i>c</i>.1135. In the prologue to the <span class="italic">Historia novella</span>  (Malmesbury, <span class="italic">Historia novella</span>, 1) he speaks of &#145;three little books of chronicles&#146;, now lost, which perhaps filled the gap.<br>
<br>Already it will be evident that William's original writings shade off into compilations, and these in turn merge into florilegia and &#145;collected&#146; editions of works by a single author or on a particular theme. It is here that William's astonishing reading and learning are shown, and the mechanics of how he stocked his abbey library revealed. His own hand has been recognized in a handful of books, including the autograph of his <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>. He seems to have cajoled many of his fellow monks into copying whole books or sections of them, and a few of these survive. Most noteworthy is his knowledge of the Latin classics. Classical and late antique authors account for a quarter of the approximately 400 works by 200 authors which William is known to have read. He compiled a florilegium of such texts, the <span class="italic">Polyhistor</span>, and all his original writings show how steeped he was in classical literature, especially the poetry of Virgil and Lucan. His love of ancient literature, his scholarship, and the sensitivity that he felt about this preference (as with his historical writing), are all illustrated by the famous preface to his collected edition of Cicero's works:<blockquote>This first book of [Cicero's] <span class="italic">Academics</span> is not to be found in England, nor the second in which Catulus is introduced disputing on behalf of the Academics, as one can tell from much that is written in the two books below &hellip; the third and fourth of the <span class="italic">Academics</span> &hellip; And Cicero says at the start of his second book <span class="italic">De Divinatione</span> that he had written a book in which he introduced Hortensius exhorting the study of philosophy; and in the same place he says that he had written six books <span class="italic">De republica</span>. Now because I have not found these books in England, I William of Malmesbury, according to my usual custom have inserted here whatever of their matter and intention I could find in the works of the blessed Augustine. And I take the opportunity to note that no-one should blame me for reading and copying as many books of the pagans as I do. Certainly whoever reads them because he avoids or despises the holy Scriptures sins gravely and deserves punishment &hellip; But he who reads them so that he may express himself elegantly and eloquently in writings to the glory of God and His saints &hellip; I do not believe that he sins in any way just because he enjoys the pagans' books. (Thomson, 51&#150;2)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Significanceandreputation"></a>Significance and reputation</h2>William's importance, then, is twofold: as England's greatest national and local historian since Bede, and as the most learned European of his day. For the period of English history before his own lifetime, it is true that for the most part he had access to written sources still available now. With some notable exceptions, for instance the reign of &AElig;thelstan, he adds only incidentally to this information. Such information and interpretation as is unique to him has to be sifted critically; some of it is legitimate interpretation, some shows the exercise of a lively imagination; some is based upon popular opinion, which itself may or may not be securely based. As he approaches his own time he becomes progressively more independent of other material, and more of a primary source in his own right. But for all periods he sets an example of intelligent and imaginative judgement, of elegant expression and lucid planning, which are the hallmarks of the great historian.<br>
<br>The influence of his writing varies astonishingly from work to work. Most of what he wrote, especially the hagiography, was too sober and sceptical to be widely popular, and survives only in single or few copies. The notable exception is <span class="italic">De miraculis beatae virginis Mariae</span>, which became the basis for more extensive miracle collections made both in England and on the continent. Of his major works the <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span> enjoyed modest popularity in England over the next century; but it was the <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span> which was far and away his most influential work over the longest time. Already within his lifetime copies spread throughout southern England, and it was known in Normandy, Flanders, and France. By the end of the century it was being used by chroniclers on both sides of the channel, and continued to be so, increasingly in competition with Geoffrey of Monmouth, until the end of the middle ages. This was partly because he included so much continental history in it, and because of his irresistibly attractive stories of marvels such as &#145;The Witch of Berkeley&#146; and &#145;The Two Clerks of Nantes&#146;. William believed that one of the duties of the historian was to entertain by means of such stories, and many of his became detached from the main work and enjoyed a life of their own. But in the end it is as a historian of England that William will be best remembered and his works laid under contribution.<h2>
