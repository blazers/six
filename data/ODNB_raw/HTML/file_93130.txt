<span class="headword">Hobman,  David Burton</span>  (1927&#150;2003), <span class="occ">social reformer and charity director</span>, was born on 8 June 1927 at 14 Walton Place, Chelsea, London, into a freethinking intellectual family. His father, Joseph Burton Hobman (1872&#150;1953), was a journalist who at one time edited the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, and counted among his friends H. G. Wells and Sigmund Freud. His wife (Hobman's mother), Daisy Lucie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adler, was a social worker who went to Oxford University late in life and was the first person to receive an Oxford diploma in social studies.<br>
<br>Hobman was educated at University College School in London and Blundell's School in Devon, after which he had a brief spell as a repertory theatre actor, once carrying a spear behind Paul Scofield at Stratford upon Avon. He began his community work in the Forest of Dean between 1954 and 1956. On 9 October 1954, at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Norton Road, Hove, he married Erica Agatha Irwin, a 29-year-old professional ice skater, and daughter of Hugh Basil Irwin, electrical engineer. They had a son, Anthony (later chief executive of the pensions regulator), and a daughter, Lucy. After a brief spell at the British Council for Aid to Refugees in 1957 Hobman moved to the National Council of Social Service, where he worked between 1958 and 1967, latterly as head of the information department. In 1968 he was appointed director of the social work advisory service. During this period he commissioned a report which recommended that voluntary organizations operate under one roof to save on overheads.<br>
<br>In 1970 Hobman became director of the National Old People's Welfare Council, which had been set up during the Second World War with a focus on developing services for older people at a local level. In 1971 it became Age Concern, and under Hobman as founding director it did much to change the negative perception of elderly people, acting as an interest group and championing the interests of older people in general. Hobman was the driving force behind a two-year project that started in 1973 to find out the views of 8000 older people across Britain through discussions and surveys. This led to the ground-breaking <span class="italic">Manifesto for Old Age</span> (1975), which established Age Concern as an organization that underpinned its campaigns with rigorous research. The <span class="italic">Manifesto for Old Age</span> helped significantly to raise the profile of older people in Britain.<br>
<br>With Hobman's energetic leadership and media expertise Age Concern campaigned for older people to be recognized as having a positive contribution to make to society, and as consumers, rather than as a drain on the nation's wealth. An early campaigning success persuaded London Transport to identify seats for older and disabled passengers. During the 1970s Age Concern identified itself with many specific causes, including the elimination of hypothermia, the retention of the death grant, and the problems experienced by social security claimants. Hobman became the engaging public face of Age Concern, hosting breakfast meetings at political party conferences and making numerous appearances on television and radio, including the <span class="italic">Jimmy Young Show</span>. Under his leadership Age Concern became the first national charitable body to employ a Westminster lobbyist and have a press office. Hobman also established its own in-house research unit. In 1983 the unit became the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology, in partnership with King's College, London, and Hobman became its chairman. Its David Hobman annual lecture was one of his many memorials. In 1983 he was appointed CBE after serving as a special adviser to the British government at the World Assembly on Ageing in Vienna the previous year. He retired from Age Concern in 1987. When he first took the helm its income was just &pound;50,000. When he retired it had risen to over &pound;8 million.<br>
<br>In the late 1980s Hobman collaborated in making a television programme, <span class="italic">Getting On</span>, for Central Television, a fortnightly national magazine programme for older people. He also presented a number of radio programmes on ageing issues. In retirement, from 1985 to 1998 he was a member of the advisory board for <span class="italic">Saga Magazine</span> and a regular contributor to its pages. He also worked as an adviser and conciliator for the Sheltered Housing Advisory and Conciliation Service from 1990 to 1994. At home, he concentrated on creating and tending his Japanese garden in Storrington, Pulborough, Sussex. In <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> his other interests were listed as reading, writing, and grandchildren. He was the author of many publications on ageing, including <span class="italic">The Impact of Ageing</span> (1981), <span class="italic">The Coming of Age</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Planning Your Retirement</span> (1990), <span class="italic">Intergenerational Solidarity: Fact and Fiction</span> (1993), and <span class="italic">The More We Are Together: a Study of Partnerships in Later Life</span> (1995). He died from cancer at St Barnabas Hospice, Columbia Drive, Worthing, Sussex, on 24 December 2003. He was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
