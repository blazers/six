<span class="headword">Needler,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1690, <em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">poet and essayist</span>, was baptized on 3 October 1690 at Horley, Surrey, the son of Henry Needler and Rose Watson. Needler was educated at a &#145;private school&#146; in Reigate. In 1708 he entered the Navy Office, where he became a friend of William Duncombe; in his leisure hours he applied himself to reading the classics and the intensive study of logic, metaphysics, and mathematics. As early as 1711 Needler complained of severe pain in his head, and this gradually became more violent; eventually he became insane. He died of a &#145;fever&#146; on 21 December 1718, and was buried in All Saints' Church, Frindsbury, near Rochester, Kent.<br>
<br>Needler's miscellaneous writings were published by Duncombe in 1724, second and third editions appearing in 1728 and 1735 (<span class="italic">Works &hellip; Consisting of Original Poems, Translations, Essays, and Letters</span>). The poems are unremarkable, including a number of competent translations from the Latin and several pieces of biblical paraphrase. &#145;To Sir Richard Blackmore, on his poem, entitled &#147;Creation&#148;&#146; is of some interest as a response to Sir Richard Blackmore's laboriously &#145;physicotheological&#146; didactic poem. More notable are the essays, which are partly modelled on those of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and other contemporary periodicals: obvious examples are &#145;On the excellency of divine contemplation&#146; and &#145;On the beauty of the universe&#146;, the second on a characteristic theme. The essay-like &#145;familiar letters&#146;, mostly dating from 1709&#150;11, touch on a variety of moral and philosophical themes, and are of particular interest on account of the intellectual influences they reflect. In a letter (November 1711) to his friend John Hughes Needler warmly praises John Norris's Neoplatonic <span class="italic">Theory of the Ideal World</span>; and in a letter (3 December 1711) to Duncombe he expresses admiration for the &#145;<i>Philosophical Meditation</i>&#146; in <span class="italic">The Moralists</span> by Anthony Ashley Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, going on to attempt an imitation of Shaftesbury's rhapsodic prose in a passage on the manifestations of the deity in the physical universe. An important additional letter to Duncombe was later published by John Duncombe. Needler emerges as highly sensitive, introspective, and intellectually curious. In his preface to the <span class="italic">Works</span> Duncombe pays tribute to Needler's personal qualities.<br>
