<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Poland, Sir  Harry Bodkin</span>  (1829&#150;1928), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born in London on 9 July 1829. He was the sixth son of Peter Poland, furrier, of Bread Street and Winchester Hall, Highgate, and his wife, Sarah Selina, daughter of Edward Matless Jackson, of London. He was educated at St Paul's School from 1841 to 1846 and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1851. He took chambers first at 7 King's Bench Walk and afterwards at 5 Paper Buildings with his friend Hardinge Giffard. The two shared these chambers until Giffard became lord chancellor in 1885. Poland followed his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2756/', "Sir William Henry Bodkin")</script> to the criminal bar, at the Old Bailey and at the Middlesex sessions at Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>In 1855 Poland appeared for the crown in the successful prosecution of the bankers Sir John Dean Paul, William Strahan, and Robert Makin Bates for misappropriation of securities. This case, according to Poland's own account, made his fortune. In 1865 he was appointed counsel to the Treasury at the central criminal court and adviser to the Home Office in criminal matters; he held these offices for twenty-three years. He was a lucid and forceful prosecutor, who was regarded as being scrupulously fair.<br>
<br>During his term of office Poland was necessarily engaged for the crown in most of the important criminal trials of the day. In 1876 he appeared for the crown against the <i>Lennie</i> mutineers who were tried for the murder of the captain and two mates of their ship. In this case he came to the conclusion that one of the prisoners, an Austrian named Giuseppe Lettis, was not a party to the murder. He therefore withdrew the case against him and accepted his evidence for the crown. After the conclusion of the case the Austrian consul enquired whether Poland would accept a decoration from the Austrian government as an expression of its appreciation of his fairness to this prisoner. Poland declined the honour.<br>
<br>Poland was also engaged for the crown in the <i>Franconia</i> case (<i>R. v. Keyn</i>, 1876) which raised the question of the jurisdiction of the English courts as regards crimes committed at sea. He also appeared on occasion for the defence: in 1868 he appeared for Edward John Eyre, governor of Jamaica, in both the criminal and the civil proceedings.<br>
<br>Besides his criminal work, Poland acquired a considerable practice in other common-law work, especially rating and licensing. He became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1879. In 1888 he took silk and resigned as Treasury counsel. He now appeared as leading counsel for the defence in criminal cases. His quiet and unimpassioned style was successful with juries, and he was probably assisted by the reputation for fairness which he had acquired as a prosecutor. He is said to have been one of the earliest exponents of the defence of kleptomania. In 1895 he retired from practice and was knighted. He was said to have refused the offer of a High Court judgeship. In 1874 he had succeeded Sir W. H. Bodkin in the recordership of Dover, an office which he retained until 1901 when he was succeeded by his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31942/', "Sir Archibald Henry Bodkin")</script>, afterwards director of public prosecutions.<br>
<br>During his retirement Poland was a frequent correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span> on matters of legal and antiquarian interest, and he was a familiar and picturesque figure, in his black skull cap and slightly old-fashioned garb, in the library of the Inner Temple, where he spent much time verifying his references.<br>
<br>Poland never married. His main interest in life until his retirement was his practice, although in his earlier years he was fond of the theatre and of swimming. He was, however, an alderman of the London county council from 1893 to 1901, and gave useful evidence at governmental inquiries into the law of licensing and rating and the defence of poor prisoners. He was also an influential advocate of the reform which was ultimately achieved by the <span class="roman">Criminal Evidence Act</span> of 1898 under which accused persons and their wives or husbands were permitted to give evidence for the defence. He was, however, an opponent of the creation of a court of criminal appeal. He published a handbook on trade marks in 1862 and <span class="italic">A Century of Law Reform</span> in 1901.<br>
<br>Poland survived into his ninety-ninth year, with his mental capacity intact until long past his ninetieth birthday. He died in his sleep at his house, 28 Sloane Gardens, Chelsea, London, on 2 March 1928.<br>
