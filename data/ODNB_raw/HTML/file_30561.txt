<span class="headword">Browne,  (William Alexander) Francis  Balfour-</span>  (1874&#150;1967), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 27 December 1874 at 16 Ebury Street, London, the eldest of the two sons and two daughters of John Hatton Balfour-Browne KC, later of Goldielea, Dumfries, and his wife, Caroline, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17208/', "Sir Robert Lush")</script>, lord justice of appeal. He showed an early interest in natural history, but received little encouragement other than prizes for collections of birds' eggs and beetles while at St Paul's School, London. At Magdalen College, Oxford, he found that the first part of the botany course had been covered at school, so he obtained permission to spend a term at Edinburgh University, where the field botanical excursions left their mark. He represented Oxford against Cambridge at hockey in 1894 and 1895, and in the former year was also awarded a half-blue for cycling. In 1896 he gained a second-class honours degree in natural science (botany).<br>
<br>To satisfy his father, Balfour-Browne went on to study law at Middle Temple, London, being called to the bar in 1898. His briefs were by his reckoning largely awarded in order to ensure that his father, as a very busy leading counsel, would give extra attention to them. His first publications concerned railway law and the law of compensation, his father's specialities. After six months' experience and much to his father's regret, he returned to Oxford to take a course in zoology. His first post was at the Plymouth marine laboratory and his first scientific publication concerned the immature stages of bony fishes. In 1902 he became director of the Sutton Broad laboratory, the first freshwater research station in Britain. In the same year Balfour-Browne married Elizabeth Lochhead (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of the Revd William Henderson Carslaw, of Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire. They had one son (John, a water beetle enthusiast), and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1906 Balfour-Browne taught biology at Queen's College, Belfast (from 1908 the Queen's University); in 1913 he went to Cambridge to teach entomology. During the First World War he served twice in France, initially as lieutenant in the sanitary company of the Royal Army Medical Corps, later as captain and staff lecturer in entomology. His first period of active service was terminated in 1916 by a shell-burst, which buried and deafened him. He recuperated by surveying many remote Galloway lochs, thus generating a database of great value following concern over the effects of acidification (&#145;acid rain&#146;). He continued to teach at Cambridge, being greatly pleased with his ability to place students in work as economic entomologists in the Colonial Office. His teaching notes were later published as <span class="italic">A Text-Book of Practical Entomology</span> (1932), which became a standard text for many university courses in entomology. When in 1925 he tried to retire, he was persuaded instead to take the chair of entomology at Imperial College, London University, working on a part-time basis. He finally retired in 1930 in order to devote the rest of his life to the study of water beetles and their distribution.<br>
<br>Inspired by the works of A. R. Wallace, and encouraged by David Sharp, the most eminent British coleopterist, Balfour-Browne's Norfolk broads studies produced arguably the first intensive, community-based, survey of an insect group. In these studies he used the recording methods of his former Ulster colleague R. Lloyd Praeger&#151;methods Balfour-Browne subsequently promoted for use in the British Isles as a whole. Balfour-Browne methodically amassed and critically appraised earlier records of water beetles, and thus became involved in taxonomy. Here his legal knowledge&#151;in particular his adversarial skill&#151;was brought to bear on the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, particularly with regard to implementation of the law of priority. Thus many of his 120 papers, written under the single forename Frank, contain extreme comments which perhaps failed to take into account the need for a common international language in naming the fauna, and also the need for diplomacy in dealing with some entomologists who were more used to being held in scientific regard than to being subjected to severe, though often justifiable, criticism.<br>
<br>Balfour-Browne's database was greatly extended, first by his own collecting across much of the British Isles, and second by his willingness to identify mundane material for others. Thus he was able to bring solid fact into a field where speculation had taken over. Theoreticians had assumed that water beetle distributions had not changed since the ice age, and had claimed the existence of land bridges not corroborated by geological knowledge. Balfour-Browne's data clearly indicated the dynamic nature of many distributions. Had he been aware of the postglacial climate pattern, with the early temperature optimum, Balfour-Browne might have been among the first to recognize that some of this dynamism resulted not from new invasions but from decline to relic status. However, his work did much to dispose of the land-bridging myth.<br>
<br>Balfour-Browne's spruce appearance, forthright comments, and genial personality wholly offset his small stature, and were familiar in many scientific societies. Widely known by the nickname B-B, he was a fellow of several learned societies, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was a keen supporter of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was a life governor of the Freshwater Biological Association, and was associated with the Nature Conservancy at its inception. His generosity extended to not only his time but also financial support for many ventures.<br>
<br>Balfour-Browne's <i>magnum opus</i> was <span class="italic">British Water Beetles</span> (1940, 1950, 1958), written as three Ray Society monographs. These have spawned and enthused two generations of &#145;water beetlers&#146;. This expansion in interest has led to an even more complete knowledge of the British fauna and also to the Balfour-Browne Club, an international group named in his honour, and founded in 1976. Balfour-Browne's last book, <span class="italic">Water Beetles and other Things</span> (1962), was partly autobiographical, and demonstrated his wit, clarity of thought, and pugnacity almost into his ninetieth year. After an illness in the winter of 1961&#150;2, he gave his collections, notebooks, and card indexes to the Royal Museum of Scotland. Balfour-Browne died suddenly on 28 September 1967 while visiting Edinburgh from his home, Brocklehirst, Collin, Dumfries, and was cremated at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 30 September 1967.<br>
