<span class="headword">Boyd,  Mark Alexander</span>  (1563&#150;1601), <span class="occ">humanist scholar and writer</span>, was born on 13 January 1563, possibly in Galloway, the son of Robert Boyd of Penkill Castle, Ayrshire. James Boyd, archbishop of Glasgow, was his uncle. His family was descended from the first Lord Boyd, who was forfeited by James III; his father was the son of the first Boyd of Penkill. The chronology and detail of Mark Alexander Boyd's life are still uncertain, and much that has been said about him is difficult to verify. It is said, for example, that he assumed the name Alexander, but was baptized only as Mark. However, his printed works all refer to him as Marcus Alexander Bodius, indicating that the full name was how he was known by his contemporaries. He is also said to have begun his advanced education at the University of Glasgow, but to have left following some unscholarly behaviour, including burning his books and insulting his masters. However, his name does not appear in the published records of the university, and in later years he exchanged polite correspondence with the principal of the university, Patrick Sharp, and also dedicated a poem to him. From this, it looks rather that his departure to the continent was occasioned by something other than his own insubordinate behaviour towards the university.<br>
<br>In 1581 Boyd went to France, and he remained on the continent until 1595. He seems to have spent his time there alternately studying and soldiering. He began studying in Paris, and from there went to Orl&eacute;ans to study civil law. He then followed his uncle's example of thirty years previous, and went to Bourges to study under Jacques Cujas. He left for Lyons about 1584, probably because of an outbreak of plague. From Lyons he travelled to Italy, where he met Cornelius Varus, who became his friend and a great admirer of his poetry. He returned to France by 1587, when he took up soldiering on behalf of Henri III. After being wounded, he returned to his study of law, this time at Toulouse, but when forces opposing Henri III captured the city, he moved to Bordeaux.<br>
<br>In Bordeaux in 1590, one of Boyd's collections of poetry and prose, <span class="italic">Epistolae quindecim</span>, was printed by Simon Millange; the other collection printed in his lifetime, the <span class="italic">Epistolae heroides et hymni</span>, was printed at La Rochelle by J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Haultin in 1592 (this collection carries the false imprint of Antwerp, but the typeface marks it out as an Haultin printing). These volumes contain a wide range of material, mostly in Latin, though there are some pieces in Greek and a treatise in French; there are also some other works by Boyd contained in manuscript, and these too are mostly in Latin.<br>
<br>Boyd's poetry includes two sets of &#145;Epistolae heroides&#146;, inspired by Ovid's poems, some of which are responses from the men addressed in Ovid's poems, and others of which extend the idea to other heroines, both mythical, such as Penelope, and historical, such as Julia Augusta. The manuscript version of these is dated 1588, two years prior to their printing. There are also seventeen &#145;Elegiae&#146;, seven only in manuscript, nine only in the 1590 printing, and one in both. The &#145;Hymni&#146;, mostly accounts of flowers and stories attached to them, are additionally interesting for their dedications to various figures, including James VI, the dauphin, and Patrick Sharp, principal of Glasgow University; these appear in the 1592 printing, together with a poem (not about a flower) in Greek. Among numerous epigrams on a range of topics there is an epitaph for James Boyd, Mark Alexander's uncle. There are also a few miscellaneous poems, including a Greek epigram also addressed to James VI.<br>
<br>Boyd's prose is equally varied, but apart from the letters it survives only in manuscript. Some of the work reflects his studies in law: there is, for example, a commentary on Justinian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, dated 1591, and also a treatise called &#145;Jurisconsultus&#146;, dedicated to Fran&ccedil;ois Balduin, possibly the Belgian jurist, though Boyd cannot have met him. Political matters are also the concern of two other works: the first is in Latin, &#145;Politicus&#146;, a treatise about the qualities of a statesman, dedicated to John Maitland, Lord Thirlestane, in 1590, and the second is in French, &#145;Discours civiles sur le royaume d'Ecosse&#146;. The latter is incomplete, however, since only one book survives out of the twelve promised in the introductory material.<br>
<br>Boyd's other treatise, &#145;Poeta&#146;, is also unfinished. It is dedicated to his friend Cornelius Varus and sets out to explore the nature and training of a poet. It is a theme to which Boyd returns in a letter to Varus, printed in the 1592 collection; in it he seems to imply that he is giving up his poetic endeavours, but not enough is known about Boyd's life to interpret that statement with any certainty. Another eighteen of Boyd's letters, often addressed to the dedicatees of the verse, were also included in the 1592 collection, although none is dated. Other letters survive in manuscript, six to a relative, Robert Boyd, dated 1595, and one from Patrick Sharp to Boyd, dated 1592.<br>
<br>More recently Boyd has become better known for the vernacular sonnet &#145;Fra banc to banc&#146; than for his works in Latin or in French. For a number of reasons the ascription of the sonnet to Boyd has been questioned: his discussions of poetry are largely concerned with writing in Latin, though he is not hostile to vernacular writing; no other vernacular work of his survives; the poem survives only in a single contemporary print and two eighteenth-century manuscript copies, and its attribution in all of these is ambiguous. However, recent work on this matter concludes that the attribution should stand. It would seem likely that this piece too was written while Boyd was in France, since the style of the print is very similar to those of the printers responsible for printing Boyd's collections in the early 1590s.<br>
<br>Boyd returned to Scotland in 1595. At least some of his last years were spent as a tutor to the earl of Cassillis, involving another journey abroad, but he died in Scotland, at Penkill, on 10 April 1601, and was buried at the church at Dailly. While his current reputation may rest on his excellent though isolated sonnet in Scots, it is clear that he is better placed in the world of other Scottish Latin poets&#151;such as George Buchanan, of whom he speaks so respectfully, and Arthur Johnston, who reprinted his works&#151;for, like them, he participated in a European rather than a narrowly Scottish culture.<br>
