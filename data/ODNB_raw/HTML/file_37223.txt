<span class="headword">Bridgeman,  William Clive</span>, first Viscount Bridgeman  (1864&#150;1935), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 31 December 1864 at 89 Harley Street, London, the only surviving child of the Revd John Robert Orlando Bridgeman (1831&#150;1897), third son of the second earl of Bradford and rector of the family living at Weston under Lizard, Staffordshire, and his wife, (Marianne) Caroline (1841&#150;1930), only child of the Ven. William Clive, great-nephew of Lord Clive of India and archdeacon of Montgomery. He was educated at a preparatory school in Malvern, at Eton College (1877&#150;84), where he became captain of oppidans, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as thirteenth classic in 1887. He was a lifelong Etonian: he briefly worked as an assistant master at the school, and that his sons each succeeded him there as captain of oppidans and that he was himself elected an Eton fellow in 1929 were sources of great personal satisfaction. Another early and enduring involvement was in cricket: a member of his school and university elevens (he gained a blue in 1887), he became a considerable &#145;gentleman&#146; cricketer and played for county sides (Shropshire and Staffordshire), I Zingari, and the MCC, of which he was elected a committee member and, in 1931, president.<br>
<br>Bridgeman established himself as a country gentleman on a Clive family estate at Leigh, near Minsterley, Shropshire, but also prepared himself for a career in politics, in which he continued his family's attachment to the Conservative Party. He was assistant private secretary to the colonial secretary, the first Viscount Knutsford, in 1889&#150;92, and to the chancellor of the exchequer, Sir Michael Hicks Beach (later Earl St Aldwyn), in 1895&#150;7. On 30 April 1895 he married Caroline Beatrix [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39506/', "Bridgeman, Dame Caroline Beatrix (1873&#150;1961)")</script>], elder daughter of Cecil Parker, land agent to the duke of Westminster. She was a strong force behind her husband's career, and from the 1920s had a distinguished public career of her own.<br>
<br>During a long search for a parliamentary seat, Bridgeman was active in London politics as chairman of the Marylebone Conservative Association and a member of the London school board from 1897 to 1904, and of London county council in 1904. After three unsuccessful contests in various constituencies, he became Conservative MP for the northern (Oswestry) division of Shropshire from 1906 to 1929.<br>
<br>Bridgeman's political rise remained slow, but this was not for want of commitment and significant activity. Adhering to the Disraelian tradition of social reform, to unionism, and to closer imperial unity&#151;a belief deepened by a world tour in 1892&#150;3&#151;he first became prominent as an activist in Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform campaign and as a critic of Balfour's party leadership. As an Anglican lay churchman he also participated in movements to defend church schools and to resist Welsh church disestablishment. After becoming an opposition whip in 1911 he helped organize the bitter division-lobby warfare against the peacetime Liberal government, and as a government whip in the Asquith coalition government of May 1915 he worked hard&#151;despite his own misgivings about cabinet vacillation&#151;to hold the Unionist parliamentary party together amid successive crises over the Dardanelles, conscription, and Ireland. During 1916 he was additionally assistant director of the war trade department. In Lloyd George's coalition governments he became parliamentary secretary successively at the newly created Ministry of Labour (December 1916&#150;January 1919) and at the Board of Trade (January 1919&#150;August 1920), and then the inaugural secretary of the new mines department (August 1920&#150;October 1922). In these posts, and from membership of the archbishops' committee on industrial relations (1917&#150;18), he acquired that contempt for strike leaders and doctrinaire socialists yet admiration for moderate, &#145;patriotic&#146; trade unionists which characterized Conservative Party leaders in the mid-1920s.<br>
<br>Participation in the 1922 Conservative under-secretaries' revolt against the coalition leadership propelled Bridgeman to the political front rank. As home secretary in the Conservative governments, October 1922&#150;January 1924, he achieved notoriety for refusing to reprieve Edith Thompson from execution after the Thompson&#150;Bywaters murder case, and for deporting over 100 Irish Republican Army suspects, an action ruled illegal by the criminal court of appeal and for which he had to obtain an act of indemnity. With similar resolution, as first lord of the Admiralty, November 1924&#150;June 1929, he upheld naval effectiveness and morale in the face of disarmament opinion and successive economy drives by the chancellor of the exchequer, Winston Churchill. He ordered resumed construction of the Singapore base and in the &#145;cruiser crisis&#146; of July 1925 he successfully wielded a resignation threat to obtain the building of new warships. As leader of the British delegation at the 1927 Geneva naval disarmament conference he resisted American claims to &#145;parity&#146; in cruisers, which in reality threatened a relative weakening of the British navy, even though this resulted in the failure of the conference and a marked deterioration in Anglo-American relations.<br>
<br>Bridgeman was of short stature, rosy-faced, and slow of speech, yet this appearance of a simple country squire was misleading. He had varied and respected political experience, exemplified by his joining the inner group of cabinet advisers during the coal dispute and general strike in 1925&#150;6. His manifest sincerity, common sense, directness, and social ease made him widely admired in the House of Commons, a quality which persuaded the archbishops in December 1927 that he could best introduce the measure for a revised prayer book there&#151;though on this occasion he badly miscalculated, and could not prevent the measure's defeat. Through the 1920s he was the closest cabinet friend of Stanley Baldwin and contributed to the tone of Baldwinite Conservatism, with its emphasis upon moral seriousness and social reconciliation. In May 1923 he canvassed notables for Baldwin's appointment as prime minister, in the autumn supported his adoption of protection, and in December encouraged him to remain leader after his general election defeat. He similarly supported Baldwin in adversity after the Conservative government's 1929 election defeat, and in a dramatic intervention in March 1931 helped persuade him to withdraw his resignation as party leader.<br>
<br>Bridgeman retired from the House of Commons at the 1929 general election. He was created a viscount in June of that year, and found new outlets for his commitment to public service. In 1930 he led a British Legion inquiry into its organization and finance. During 1932 he chaired a committee of inquiry on the Post Office, became chairman of the standing committee of the Church of England's National Society (responsible for administering church schools), and was appointed to the BBC board of governors. In March 1935 he succeeded J. H. Whitley as chairman of the BBC, but his tenure was too short to leave any mark. He was also a Shropshire JP and deputy lieutenant, a privy councillor (1920), an elder brother of Trinity House (1928), honorary LLD of Cambridge University (1930), and a long-serving chairman of the governors of Shrewsbury School. Bridgeman died at home at Leigh Manor, near Minsterley, on 14 August 1935, and was buried in the churchyard of the nearby village of Hope. The Bridgemans had three eminent sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58054/', "Robert Clive Bridgeman, the second viscount")</script>, had a distinguished army career and became lord lieutenant of Shropshire; Geoffrey John Orlando Bridgeman (1898&#150;1974) was a leading eye surgeon; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47921/', "Sir Maurice Richard Bridgeman")</script> was a senior civil servant and later chairman of British Petroleum.<br>
