<span class="headword">Crockford,  John</span>  (1824/5&#150;1865), <span class="occ">publisher of Crockford's Clerical Directory</span>, was perhaps born in Taunton, though his origins and parentage are obscure. No baptism has been traced, but his marriage certificate records him as the son of John Crockford, schoolmaster. By his early twenties he was in business as a printer and publisher at 29 Essex Street, Strand, and it was from that address that <span class="italic">Crockford's Directory</span> was first published in 1858.<br>
<br>Crockford's long association with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6522/', "Edward William Cox")</script> had begun by 1843, when the <span class="italic">Law Times</span> first appeared. The two men shared the same business address in Essex Street, and were joint founders of a number of periodicals, including <span class="italic">The Critic</span> and <span class="italic">The Field</span>. Cox, as the elder, more established, and richer man, was the financial backer and often the named publisher. When the <span class="italic">Clerical Directory</span> came to be planned, Cox's professional ethics (he was then recorder of Helston and Falmouth) forbade the use of his name in the title. However, the legend that he therefore picked, almost at random, the name of one of his office clerks, is far from the truth. Crockford was manager of the joint enterprises, &#145;a splendid man of business&#146;. It was he who bought the embryonic <span class="italic">Field</span> &#145;for a trifling sum&#146;, and within a short time achieved profits amounting to &pound;20,000 a year.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Clerical Directory</span> was first published in weekly parts from 1855 to 1857, initially as a supplement to the <span class="italic">Clerical Journal</span>. The first full edition seems to have been assembled in a very haphazard fashion, with names added as fast as they could be obtained, out of alphabetical order, and with an unreliable index. The 1858 volume stated that the 1859 edition would be in a more orderly sequence; in fact the 1860 volume was the first to be entitled <span class="italic">Crockford's Clerical Directory</span>, and in its new format was a very much more useful work of reference, with excellent bibliographical as well as career information. By 1917, with the absorption of its only serious rival, the <span class="italic">Clergy List</span>, <span class="italic">Crockford's Clerical Directory</span> reigned supreme. The famous &#145;prefaces&#146;, with sometimes sharp comments on the condition of the Church of England, began in 1869, after Crockford's death. From 1921 <span class="italic">Crockford</span>, as it had become known, was published by Oxford University Press.<br>
<br>No more than glimpses survive of Crockford's personality. John C. Francis (of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>) recorded that, &#145;I had occasion to call on him a short time before his death, when we joined in a hearty laugh over his former furious attacks upon <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. &#147;Dilke's Drag&#148; he used to call it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 29 Nov 1879, 695).<br>
<br>Crockford married Annie Ellam on 24 December 1847 at St Pancras Old Church. No children are recorded. His sudden death occurred at his home, 10 Park Road, Haverstock Hill, London, on 13 January 1865, when he was aged forty. His will, proved on 6 February 1865, left everything to his widow. His personal effects were valued at less than &pound;1000, but the family must have lived in some style, since one of the witnesses to the will was the resident coachman.<br>
