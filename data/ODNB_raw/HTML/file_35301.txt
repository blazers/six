<span class="headword">Oldham,  Joseph Houldsworth</span>  (1874&#150;1969), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in Girgaum, Bombay, India, on 10 October 1874, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel George Wingate Oldham RE (1840&#150;1923), and his wife, Eliza (Lillah) Houldsworth (<i>d</i>. 1890). George Oldham retired early from his successful career to take his delicate wife home. Oldham attended the Edinburgh Academy and, passing out dux in 1892, entered Trinity College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in both honour moderations (1894) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1896), with a career in the Indian Civil Service in mind. His plans changed as the result of a religious conversion under the influence of D. L. Moody, the American evangelist. Having signed the pledge of the Student Volunteer Missionary Union, and after working as the first secretary to the Student Christian Mission (1896&#150;7), he went to India in 1897 under the auspices of the Scottish YMCA to work among students and government employees in Lahore. The following year he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1965), only daughter of Sir Andrew Fraser, later governor of Bengal. They had no children.<br>
<br>Oldham spent three years in India, almost entirely in the company of Indians, and became very sensitive to their aspirations. After catching typhoid he was invalided home and in 1901 entered New College, Edinburgh, where he completed his theological studies with distinction. He then went to the University of Halle, Germany, to study missionary theory and practice under Gustav Warneck. Although never ordained, Oldham became a ministerial assistant at Free St George's, Edinburgh, and worked to promote the study of missions among students and in Scottish congregations. Throughout his life he saw the work of the laity and the involvement of youth as everywhere crucial to the future of the church and its mission. In 1908 he was appointed full-time organizing secretary for the Edinburgh World Missionary Conference of 1910. The conference included not only all shades of Anglican opinion but also members of the younger churches, as Oldham had hoped, and can be regarded as the start of the modern ecumenical movement. His own remarkable administrative success led the conference to appoint him secretary to a proposed &#145;Edinburgh continuation committee&#146; under the chairmanship of his close friend John R. Mott, the American evangelist.<br>
<br>In the brief period before the First World War Oldham managed to meet the main mission boards on the continent, in Great Britain, and in America. Most significant among the committee's ventures was the <span class="italic">International Review of Missions</span>, established in 1912 with Oldham as editor. He created a distinguished quarterly by his editorials and comprehensive reviews of the year, and by enlisting as contributors not only outstanding missionaries but scientists and administrators. He won Roman Catholic co-operation and continued as editor until 1927.<br>
<br>Although the continuation committee foundered, Oldham, as the servant of all missions and especially of those hardest hit by the war, tried to keep the spirit of internationalism alive. Working through both the Conference of British Missionary Societies (CBMS) and the committee on missions and governments, Oldham approached heads of government departments on delicate matters such as the internment of German missionaries in India and their expulsion from their African spheres. He was successful in preventing the confiscation of German mission properties; he negotiated the terms for the ultimate return of German missionaries and, with Archbishop Randall Davidson, secured the inclusion in the peace treaty of a clause guaranteeing freedom for missions in former German colonies. In 1920 Joe Oldham, as he was commonly and affectionately known, prepared proposals for a new departure in international missionary co-operation, with the result that in 1921 he became secretary of a new International Missionary Council (IMC), its membership comprising national or regional councils of churches and missions. To further his plans he visited India, China, and Canada (1922&#150;3), and played a crucial role in securing strong Indian representation in the National Christian Council there. The government's recognition of Oldham's unique position as spokesman for so many missions, his mastery of facts, and his recognition that &#145;governments must govern&#146;, established him as a trusted adviser.<br>
<br>Occasionally Oldham was an equally effective critic of government policies. His writings included <span class="italic">The World and the Gospel</span> (1916) which sold more than 20,000 copies in Britain alone and helped to lift the sights of war-engrossed Christians to the world beyond Europe, above all to Africa.<blockquote>Shall the African peoples be enabled to develop their latent powers, to cultivate their peculiar gifts and so enrich the life of humanity by their distinctive contributions? Or shall they be depressed and degraded and made the tool of others? (Bliss, 576)</blockquote>For Oldham this was &#145;one of the great issues of history&#146;  (ibid.) and, as he told Colin Leys, required for him &#145;the throwing of the weight of missionary influence more definitely and explicitly on the side of justice and the treatment of native populations&#146;  (Cell, 145). Soon after the war he joined forces with Bishop Frank Weston, among others, in opposition to forced labour in Kenya. Unable to obtain satisfaction from the secretary of state for the colonies, Oldham organized a massive and highly successful protest by politicians of all parties, humanitarians such as the Anti-Slavery Society, religious leaders, academics, and editors of the national press. In general, however, he preferred quietly to pursue the art of the possible. After Edinburgh, his move to London, the IMC's office in Chelsea, and membership of the Athenaeum, were positively conducive to constructive compromises behind the scenes. His knowledge of both the Kenyan and the Indian scenes thrust him unexpectedly in 1922&#150;3 into the role of mediator between Europeans and Indians in Kenya. His own principle that, whatever the claims of white settlers or Indians, native African interests should be paramount was eventually spelt out in July 1923 in the imperial government's important statement of policy known as the &#145;Devonshire declaration&#146;.<br>
<br>Oldham's lifelong interest in education centred at first on India, but his main achievement was in relation to Africa. Despite official reluctance he set out to persuade the Colonial Office in close co-operation with the missions to play a more positive role. Having visited institutions for the education of black people in the southern United States as early as 1912, Oldham worked closely with the Phelps&#150;Stokes Fund on its visits to east Africa in the early 1920s and its recommendations to the British government. With support from several colonial governors and missionary societies he developed proposals that led to the establishment in 1923 of the advisory committee on native education in tropical Africa. Oldham was an active member from its inception until 1936 and, with Sir Frederick Lugard, drafted what became an important statement of policy (&#145;Memorandum on native education in British tropical Africa&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1924&#150;5, 21, Cmd 2374).<br>
<br>From his base in the international missionary movement Oldham thus contributed enormously to the post-war definition of concepts of imperial &#145;trusteeship&#146;. Very soon his work was given institutional form. In 1926 he organized at High Legh the first conference of missionary educators and colonial administrators, and seized on a suggestion made there for an international institute of African languages and cultures. His links with the Colonial Offices of European governments, his access to Rockefeller funds, and the aid of helpers such as Edwin Smith and Diedrich Westermann enabled him to bring the idea into effect. Lugard became its chairman. From 1931 to 1938 Oldham was administrative director, promoting a research and publications programme which included the distinguished journal <span class="italic">Africa</span>, Professor B. Malinowski's seminars for young anthropologists, and Lord Hailey's influential <span class="italic">An African Survey</span> (1938). In 1924 Oldham had published his most influential book, <span class="italic">Christianity and the Race Problem</span>. As its author he was invited to visit southern and east Africa in 1926. In South Africa he was appalled by the &#145;colour bar&#146; act, for &#145;doctrines of racial domination&#146;, he was convinced, would lead the world &#145;directly and inevitably to catastrophe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christianity and the Race Problem</span>, 9). In east Africa, however, he saw more hope and seriously considered becoming research director to Kenya's governor, Sir Edward Grigg (later Lord Altrincham). Instead he accepted appointment to the commission on closer union between the east African territories, chaired by Sir E. Hilton Young (later Lord Kennet). Oldham and Sir George Schuster wrote its intricate and carefully argued report. Vociferous opposition from the Kenya settlers, coupled with the chairman's refusal to sign, seemed to incline the imperial government towards handing over control to the settlers. Once more Oldham, with the support of the CBMS and again in partnership with Lugard, organized successful pressure and secured reference of the issue to a joint select committee of both houses of parliament (1931). <span class="italic">What is at Stake in East Africa</span> and <span class="italic">White and Black in Africa</span> both appeared in 1930, each in its own way attacking that &#145;most dangerous doctrine&#146;  (Oldham to Mott, 21 Nov 1929, J. R. Mott MSS) of &#145;white Christian settler civilization&#146; as Africa's best hope.<br>
<br>The need for broader missionary perspectives and closer co-operation between missions and state if African interests were to be served in the modern world were themes central to the conference Oldham organized at Le Zoute, Belgium, in 1926. They also influenced his own decision in 1928 to go with Hilton Young to east Africa rather than join the missions at the Jerusalem world conference, and informed the many speeches he made on both sides of the Atlantic which were summarized in <span class="italic">The New Christian Adventure</span> (1929). Its theological justification Oldham saw in the need for a new missionary approach to engage effectively with a worldwide secular culture, one in which the &#145;field&#146; and the &#145;base&#146; of such a mission were everywhere and its chief agents the Christian laity. To supplement the mastery of nature and control of the future which science was progressively achieving there must be an attitude to life based on relationship&#151;man with nature, man with man, and man with God. He introduced the thought of Eberhard Grisebach and Martin Buber to English-speaking audiences, and this &#145;relational&#146; philosophy informed his later books, <span class="italic">Real Life is Meeting</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">Life is Commitment</span> (1953).<br>
<br>Oldham's donnish earnestness and infinite capacity for taking pains bred impatience with inward-looking missionary conferences that failed to seek clear or practical answers to well defined questions. This was heightened by his engagement with governments and public policy, as well as by his mounting deafness in middle life and the logistics of managing his vast hearing aid. Mott and the IMC, however, several times refused his resignation, preferring instead to appoint an additional secretary and to allow Oldham leeway for his own preoccupations. These lay not with ecclesiastical organization but with other forms of support for the laity, trying to live out their faith in the world. In 1934, therefore, Oldham became chairman of the research committee for the Universal Christian Council for Life and Work, and began preparations for the world conference of church, community, and state. Racist philosophies, the growth of totalitarian states, and the church policies of the German government all gave particular point to Oldham's sustained attempt to arouse Christians and others to the issues at stake. This was perhaps his most successful educative campaign, helping to shape Christian thinking for a generation. Before and after the conference, held at Oxford in 1937, essential steps were also taken to bring existing ecumenical movements into a single world council whose members would be individual churches. Archbishop William Temple provided the leadership, Oldham the agenda, looking forward to the World Council of Churches in 1948.<br>
<br>On retirement in 1938 from the IMC and the International Institute, Oldham remained as active as ever. To carry on the ideas of the life and work conference, he founded the fortnightly <span class="italic">Christian News Letter</span> in 1939 and edited it throughout the war. The Christian Frontier Council, founded in 1942 as a lay movement bringing together lay expertise and Christian insight, was also his conception. His great capacity for friendship, his eye for issues of the moment, and his management of small discussion groups were legendary. Some of these (for example, <span class="italic">The Era of Atomic Power</span>, 1947) produced corporate findings. Others, such as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/67745', "Moot")</script>, a group of intellectuals drawn to Oldham who included T. S. Eliot and Karl Mannheim, had their outcome in the thought and writings of the members.<br>
<br>Public recognition also came with the degrees of DD conferred on Oldham by Edinburgh (1931) and Oxford (1937) and a CBE in 1951. In 1952 he moved to Dunford House, near Midhurst, where he not only walked in the Sussex countryside but also wrote his last book. As the affairs of east and central Africa again became critical, his <span class="italic">New Hope in Africa</span> (1955) was a warm but ill judged response to the multiracial enthusiasms of a new generation represented by the Capricorn Africa Society. He died on 16 May 1969 at St Leonards, Sussex.<br>
