<span class="headword">Marshall,  Andrew</span>  (1779&#150;1854), <span class="occ">United Secession minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Westerhill in the parish of Cadder, Lanarkshire, on 22 November 1779. He was educated locally before attending classes at Glasgow University. He also went to the Secession Divinity Hall at Selkirk, making the lengthy journey on foot over two days. In November 1802 he was ordained to the church in Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He married Agnes (1785&#150;1847), the daughter of John Dick, a merchant, and his wife, Henrietta Easton, and they had two daughters and four sons. He served as moderator of the synod of the United Secession church in 1836, and was honoured with the degrees of DD from Jefferson College (1841) and LLD from Washington College (1842) in the United States.<br>
<br>Marshall's disputatious nature involved him in two major controversies. In the first, the &#145;voluntary&#146; controversy, he articulated the growing conviction among Scottish dissenters that church establishments were unjust and that churches should look to their members alone for support. This view was expressed in a sermon preached by him in Greyfriars Church, Glasgow, in April 1829, later published as <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Establishments Considered</span>. A fierce and widespread debate, in which Marshall was prominent, continued throughout the following decade. The second controversy, the atonement controversy, was to prove Marshall's undoing. It began in 1841 with the suspension of James Morison from his duties as a United Secession minister. The principal charge against him related to his view of the universal nature of the atonement, a view which challenged the traditional Calvinist orthodoxy of his church. Marshall thought that Morison's views were, in effect, those of the church's own professors Robert Balmer and John Brown. Marshall restated the conservative view of the atonement in <span class="italic">The Death of Christ the Redemption of his People</span> (1842), and in <span class="italic">The Catholic Doctrine of Redemption Vindicated</span> (1844) he attached an appendix which made a specific attack on the professors. However, his extended campaign against them ended in defeat and earned him a humiliating public rebuke from the synod. Marshall broke away from the United Secession church in October 1846, the breach further embittered by attempts to evict him from his church buildings. In spite of contacts with the Free and Original Secession churches, he formed no new attachment before his death on 26 November 1854 at Kirkintilloch. He was buried at Cadder.<br>
<br>Marshall was a major influence on the presbyterian churches in Scotland, if never quite in the way that he intended. Arguably, he did as much as any other individual to bring the Free Church of Scotland into existence by the debate on church&#150;state relations which he initiated. The thorough rehearsal of arguments in the course of the atonement controversy made it clear that the theology of his colleagues was increasingly liberal, and Marshall's departure helped to clear the way for union with the Relief church, not least because he had been on the union committee. Even by the standards of Secession ministers Marshall was a difficult man, with an obstinate loyalty to principle untempered by any tendency towards conciliation. His isolation at the end of his life would have been complete had it not been for the loyalty of the majority of his congregation and of his son William (<i>d</i>. 1860), a United Secession minister in Leith, who seceded at the same time as his father and eventually succeeded him in his Kirkintilloch charge, by then a Free Church congregation.<br>
