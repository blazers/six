<span class="headword">Heywood,  James</span>  (1810&#150;1897), <span class="occ">politician, university reformer, and philanthropist</span>, was born in Everton, Liverpool, on 28 May 1810, the fifth son of Nathaniel Heywood, a partner in the Manchester bank of Benjamin Heywood &amp; Sons, and his wife, Ann, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21921/', "Thomas Percival, MD FRS")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13179/', "Sir Benjamin Heywood")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13191/', "Thomas Heywood")</script> were his elder brothers. His early education was at Manchester, followed by a period at Lant Carpenter's school at Bristol, and attendance at the universities of Edinburgh and Geneva. He entered Heywood's bank at Manchester, but on inheriting a fortune from his uncle (B. A. Heywood) he gave up banking and returned to study, entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1829. Although ranked twelfth senior optime in the mathematical tripos (1833), Heywood, being a Unitarian, was debarred from taking his degree by the religious tests then in force. He was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1838, but did not practise.<br>
<br>After settling in Manchester, where he was one of the trustees of the Cross Street Chapel, Heywood became a member of the Unitarian network which played a prominent role in the cultural institutions of the city. He devoted his time to learned societies, of which his house in Mosley Street was often the centre. He was elected in 1833 to membership of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, of which his maternal grandfather had been a founder, and was himself one of the founders, with Richard Cobden and William Langton, of the Manchester Athenaeum, which opened in 1839 to provide reading rooms and lectures. Heywood envisaged the Athenaeum as bringing the culture of science, literature, and philosophy to young men working in commercial occupations in Manchester. A founder also, in 1838, of the Manchester Geological Society, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1839, and was a local secretary when the British Association met in Manchester in 1842. He was a fellow of the Statistical Society, a member of the first council of the Chetham Society, and president (1853&#150;8) of the Unitarian Manchester New College. From 1845 to 1860 he was a trustee of the non-denominational Owens College, Manchester.<br>
<br>A radical in politics, Heywood was a member of the Anti-Corn Law League. Reform of the ancient universities, whose religious and social exclusiveness hindered the diffusion of culture, became his principal interest. He edited a collection of Cambridge university and college statutes (1840) and gave financial support to the publication of translations of early statutes of Oxford colleges to expose the extent of their neglect. In 1850 he paid his Trinity College contemporary, Thomas Wright, to produce translations of the statutes of Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, and later (1855) to produce an edition of Cambridge University documents from the period of the puritan controversies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Heywood himself compiled and published statistics on the state of the English universities in the 1840s. As MP for North Lancashire from 1847 to 1857, he became the leading parliamentary promoter of state intervention to reform the universities; his motion in April 1850 was the occasion for Lord John Russell to announce the appointment of royal commissions into both Oxford and Cambridge. The climax of his parliamentary career was in June 1854 when he carried an amendment removing religious tests for those matriculating or taking BA degrees at Oxford; a similar amendment to the <span class="roman">Cambridge University Bill</span> in June 1856 enabled him to graduate BA (1857) from his old university.<br>
<br>Heywood married in June 1853 Annie (<i>d</i>. 1872), widow of Gustav Albert Escher of Z&uuml;rich and daughter of John Kennedy of Ardwick Hall, Lancashire. They had one daughter, Anne Sophia. They were resident from 1859 in Kensington, where Heywood was active in the Notting Hill Unitarian congregation. He was an early promoter of the free public library movement, speaking in favour of the <span class="roman">Public Libraries Act</span> in 1850 and maintaining at his own expense a public library in Notting Hill High Street from 1874 until 1887 when he donated it to the parish of Kensington and Chelsea. He was a founder member in 1875 of the Sunday Society to promote the opening of museums, art galleries, and public libraries on Sundays.<br>
<br>Having secured the admission of dissenters to the universities, Heywood, who was a supporter of women's suffrage, worked to make university education available to women. Nominated by the crown a member of the senate of London University, he advocated opening London degrees to women. In 1869 he was one of the original members of Emily Davies's committee for the foundation of a college for women, which led to the establishment of Girton College, Cambridge. He was a member of the council of the college from 1872 until his death.<br>
<br>Heywood was an early member of the Royal Historical Society, contributing to its transactions articles on Swiss freedom and the progress of free thought; his presidency of the society's council from 1878 to 1880 immediately preceded the displacement of the older generation of antiquaries and amateurs, to which he belonged, by university teachers of history. Though not conspicuous as a scholar in his own right, Heywood held a Unitarian faith in the power of reason, and throughout his life used his substantial wealth to support the spread of knowledge. He died at his London home, 26 Kensington Palace Gardens, on 17 October 1897, and was buried in Barnes cemetery.<br>
