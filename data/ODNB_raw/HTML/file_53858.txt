<span class="headword">Mathers,  Samuel Liddell</span>  (1854&#150;1918), <span class="occ">occultist</span>, was born on 8 January 1854 at 11 De Beauvoir Place, Hackney, Middlesex, the son of William Mathers, a merchant's clerk, and his wife, Mary Ann, formerly Collins (<i>d</i>. 1885). From 1866 to 1870 he received a classical education at Bedford School, before going to live with his widowed mother at Bournemouth, where he worked as a clerk and developed his twin passions of &#145;magic and the theory of war&#146;  (Yeats, 183). His occult studies were first guided by his neighbour and fellow freemason, Frederick Holland, and they were admitted together, in 1882, into the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, where Mathers was befriended by William Wynn Westcott, with whom he later created the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.<br>
<br>Mathers's military zeal was expressed by joining a local volunteer regiment and by translating and adapting a French military manual, published in 1884 as <span class="italic">Practical Instruction in Infantry Campaigning Exercise</span>. He also took up both fencing and boxing and delighted in aiding the authorities&#151;as a civilian&#151;in quelling public disturbances. It was in the context of his militarism that his less desirable personality traits first appeared. Fantasies about his social status are apparent in an early photograph in which he is wearing the uniform of a volunteer lieutenant (he was never commissioned), and his inability to accept defeat with a good grace was recorded by A. E. Waite, who noted that Mathers debarred a potential candidate for the Golden Dawn who had beaten him in a fencing match. Nor could Mathers accept that others matched his knowledge of occultism: he rejected Holland in the early 1880s because he was the better scholar, and Westcott ten years later for the same reason. In this respect Mathers was transparent; Waite described his learning as &#145;undigested&#146;  (<span class="italic">Occult Review</span>, 199) and to W. B. Yeats he &#145;had much learning but little scholarship, much imagination and imperfect taste&#146;  (Yeats, 87). His imagination was nowhere more apparent than in his Celtic pretensions&#151;already in 1878 he was adding MacGregor to his name and styling himself comte de Glenstrae&#151;which were to become an increasingly important part of his self-perception.<br>
<br>After the death of his mother in January 1885 Mathers moved to London and became active in occult circles. By 1887 he had published his first esoteric work, <span class="italic">The Kabbalah Unveiled</span>, and was helping Westcott to develop the rituals that formed the basis of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In March 1888 they brought the order into being and, in company with William Woodman, became its first chiefs. One of the first initiates was the artist Mina Bergson (1865&#150;1928), the sister of the philosopher Henri Bergson, who became Mathers's wife in June 1890 and lent her artistic talents to the creation of a second order, the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. The rituals of this wholly magical inner order were entirely the work of Mathers who was, without question, a ritualist of genius.<br>
<br>However, magicians must eat, and Mathers was desperately poor despite his writing; he had published a small book on tarot cards in 1888 and a masterly edition of <span class="italic">The Key of Solomon the King</span> in 1889. Escape from poverty came by way of Annie Horniman, who was both a friend of Mina Mathers and a prominent member of the Golden Dawn. She obtained a post for him at her father's private museum and made the couple a regular allowance even when they settled in Paris in May 1892. Mathers fitted well in <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> Paris, moving in its occult circles and establishing, in 1894, the Ahathoor Temple of the Golden Dawn. He was also becoming arrogant and quarrelsome towards London members of the order, engineering Westcott's removal from office, demanding ever more money from Annie Horniman, and expelling her in 1896 when she cut off his allowance.<br>
<br>By this time Mathers was showing signs of paranoia, but he continued to work on magical texts&#151;his most significant work, <span class="italic">The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage</span>, appeared in 1898&#151;and he set up a new occult activity in Paris, the Rites of Isis. He also continued to direct the activities of the Golden Dawn, albeit in an increasingly erratic manner. Matters came to a head in 1900 when Mathers wrote to Florence Farr telling her that Westcott had forged the documents on which the order's authority was founded. In the furore that followed Mathers refused to justify his allegation, expelled the &#145;rebels&#146; and sent Aleister Crowley to take possession of the London headquarters. On their part the members expelled Mathers and had Crowley bodily ejected. Mathers fired off a barrage of manic, abusive letters but for all practical purposes he had lost his influence. Only the rump of the Golden Dawn remained loyal to him and he was taken in by two adventurers, a couple named Horos, whose criminal activities opened the order to public ridicule at their trial in 1901.<br>
<br>Nor was this the end of Mathers's woes. Two of his unpublished works, an edition of a magical text, the <span class="italic">Lesser Key of Solomon</span>, and a <span class="italic">Book of Correspondences</span>, were &#145;borrowed&#146; by Crowley and published under his name in 1904 and 1909. Even worse, in 1910 Crowley went on to publish the rituals of the Golden Dawn in his journal, <span class="italic">The Equinox</span>, Mathers having failed to stop the publication by legal means. Mathers lapsed into complete obscurity. When he died at his home, rue Ribera, Paris, on 20 November 1918 of influenza, no one outside occult circles noticed his death. This was in keeping with his own expectations. In 1898 he had declared: &#145;for the opinion of the ordinary literary critic who neither understands nor believes in Occultism, I care nothing&#146;  (Mathers, <span class="italic">Abra-Melin</span>, xxxviii).<br>
