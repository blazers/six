<span class="headword">Thyer,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1709, <em>d.</em> 1781), <span class="occ">librarian and literary editor</span>, was born in Manchester and baptized at Manchester collegiate church on 20 February 1709, the son of Robert Thyer (<i>bap</i>. 1672), a silk weaver or barber, and Elizabeth Brabant, who married on 25 August 1703. Educated at Manchester grammar school, he won an exhibition in 1727 to Brasenose College, Oxford, whence he graduated BA on 12 October 1730. On returning to his native town he was elected librarian of Chetham's Library in February 1732, and continued in that office until 3 October 1763.<br>
<br>Thyer, the first man not in holy orders to be elected to the librarianship, brought about a modernization of the library. He abandoned the practice of chaining books, increased the storage capacity, introduced a new classification system derived from that set up by Conyers Middleton at Cambridge University Library, and commenced work on a new catalogue based on subject access. His diligence was certified by the library's trustees on his retirement, and by his successor, in the Latin preface to the Chetham's Library catalogue of 1791. During his librarianship the library became a focus for religious and philosophical debate, centred on a series of informal seminars held by Thyer and a group of friends.<br>
<br>On 9 December 1741 Thyer married Silence Leigh (1714&#150;1753), daughter of John Wagstaffe of Glossop and Manchester, and widow of John Leigh of Middle Hulton in Deane, Lancashire. Through his marriage he became close friends of the Egertons of Tatton, Cheshire; Samuel Egerton MP left him an annuity of &pound;200 on his death in 1780. Thyer was also an intimate friend of his fellow townsman, the poet John Byrom, and many of his letters, as well as a specimen of his verse, are printed in Byrom's <span class="italic">Literary Remains</span>.<br>
<br>Thyer was a keen literary scholar and he supplied notes to Thomas Newton, later bishop of Bristol, for his edition of Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>. In 1755 he published a proposal for a new annotated edition of Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> and in 1759 he published his edition of <span class="italic">The Genuine Remains in Verse and Prose of Samuel Butler, with Notes</span>, in two volumes, which was praised by Dr Johnson, but condemned by Bishop Warburton. Warburton's criticisms are at best uncharitable. Thyer was a diligent if pedantic scholar, more suited to editorial work than original thought, but his edition of Butler was both accurate and scholarly and Johnson's view is a fairer assessment of his work.<br>
<br>Thyer died on 27 October 1781 in Long Millgate, Manchester, and was buried with his ancestors in Manchester collegiate church. His wife and all their children had predeceased him.<br>
