<span class="headword">Pringle,  Walter, of Greenknowe</span>  (1625&#150;1667), <span class="occ">covenanter</span>, was born in Bartinbush, Dumfriesshire, the second son of Robert Pringle (1581?&#150;1649), first laird of Stitchel, Roxburghshire, and his first wife, Catherine Hamilton of Silverton Hill. Robert Pringle, second son of George Pringle of Craiglatch, was originally of Bartinbush but, making his fortune as a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, in 1628 he purchased the lands and barony of Stitchel from Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar, later first Viscount Kenmure. Robert continued to acquire various lands in Berwickshire, including in 1637 the lands of Wester Gordon from James Seton of Touch which were granted to Robert and his wife, but on his death to pass to his second surviving son, Walter, including &#145;the manor place called Greenknowe&#146;  (Thomson and others, 6/2.374&#150;5). Robert Pringle represented Roxburghshire as a commissioner to parliament from 1639 to 1641 and became a regular on the parliamentary commissions and committees of the covenanter regime, including the commission for manufactories (1641), the commission for loans and tax (1643), and the committee of war (1643&#150;9).<br>
<br>Walter Pringle was apparently educated at Edinburgh University but seems not to have graduated. As a boy he and his elder brother John were put in the care of James Leckie, an ejected minister of Stirling. This attempt at a &#145;godly&#146; education was abandoned after Leckie's death in the 1630s, and the youthful Pringle began, in his own words, &#145;years of darkness, deadness and sinfulness&#146; including a year in Leith and two years in France  (&#145;Memoirs&#146;, 1.424). On the death of his father in 1649 he succeeded to the estate of Greenknowe, his father's grandson Sir Robert Pringle of Stitchel succeeding to the Stitchel estate. He married Janet Pringle, daughter of James Pringle of Torwoodlie, Selkirkshire, in November 1649. Their marriage took place at Stow and the officiating minister was James Guthrie of Lauder, and later of Stirling, the covenanting martyr who was executed in 1661. Walter Pringle had his father's enthusiasm for the covenanting regime and, according to his own memoirs, spent five years in the 1640s as a volunteer soldier. On the invasion of Scotland by Cromwell in 1650 Walter, along with his younger brother-in-law George Pringle of Torwoodlie (1631&#150;1689), who was later part of the disastrous Argyll rebellion of 1685, joined the covenanting army in its defeat at the battle of Dunbar in September 1650. Cromwell's victory over covenanting forced Walter and George Pringle to take refuge at Torwoodlie. In November, however, when Walter was returning from a visit to his wife at Stitchel where she had just given birth to Catherine, their first child, an incident occurred whereby he killed an English trooper. This led him to take more distant refuge in Northumberland where he stayed with his cousin, a certain Major Pringle, although before long he was arrested and brought to trial at Selkirk. Fortunately, his plea of self-defence was accepted and he was allowed liberty on a bond of &pound;2000 sterling. He lived peaceably for the remainder of the 1650s.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Pringle's covenanting beliefs became the target of official displeasure and he was cast into prison in Edinburgh Castle in September 1660 for &#145;ayding, assisting and pairtaking with the Remonstrantors and uther seditious persones&#146;  (Nicoll, 302). Although not detained long, in July 1664 his nonconformity led to his trial and examination before Archbishop Sharp and the court of high commission, created that year. Finding difficulty in taking the oath of allegiance, and especially that part referring to royal supremacy over the church, Pringle incurred the wrath of the episcopate when attempting to take the oath according to Bishop James Ussher's old formula as approved by James VI. He was heavily fined and subsequently, in November, imprisoned in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh for defaulting on the fine. After confinement for several months he was in the summer of 1665 banished to the burgh of Elgin, and his exile continued until February 1666 when a group of his friends, without his knowledge, obtained from the high commission a transfer to &#145;open prison&#146; at his own home of Greenknowe and 3 miles around. The government conceded this on payment of &pound;200 sterling and his agreement to peaceable behaviour.<br>
<br>Little detail of Pringle's private life is known, other than that provided by his autobiography, <span class="italic">The memoirs of Walter Pringle of Greenknowe, or, Some of the few mercies of God to him, and his will to his children, left them under his own hand</span>, written in those years of intermittent captivity from 1662 to 1666, first printed posthumously in 1723 and republished by the Wodrow Society in 1845. It is a pious &#145;life&#146; full of fatherly advice, Christian virtue, and awe at the godliness of the ministry, yet tinged with doubt and fallibility. Pringle and his wife had a large family of five sons and three daughters; he was succeeded by his sons Robert and, in 1677, James, who transcribed the &#145;Memoirs&#146;, then by his grandson George, son of James (1694), and after him his own ageing son John (1724). Walter Pringle died at Greenknowe on 12 December 1667. He was survived by his wife. His will and testament have not survived.<br>
