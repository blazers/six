<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mott, Sir  Basil</span>, first baronet  (1859&#150;1938), <span class="occ">civil and mining engineer</span>, was born at Leicester on 16 September 1859, the youngest son of Frederick Thompson Mott, wine merchant, of Birstall Hill near Leicester and his first wife, Elizabeth Ann (daughter of Isaac Dobell), who died in 1861. The Mott family came from the Weald where, as yeoman farmers, artisans, craftsmen, and later businessmen, they traced their origins to Guillaume de la Motte who came over from Normandy to Hastings in 1524. Mott was educated at Leicester grammar school, at the International College at Isleworth, and at Solothurn in Switzerland. From 1876 to 1879 he was a student at the Royal School of Mines, South Kensington, where he was awarded the Murchison medal and elected to an associateship. After pupillage at Whitwick colliery, Leicestershire, and at Sheffield, Mott spent three years as engineer to the Neston Colliery Company, Cheshire, in charge of all machinery and underground haulage; there he also had his first experience in tunnelling.<br>
<br>James Henry Greathead, an outstanding figure in soft-ground tunnelling and responsible for major developments in the design and application of tunnelling shields, recruited Mott in 1883 to assist in preparing for the construction of the first deep-level &#145;tube&#146;, for the City and Southwark Railway Company, of which his uncle, Charles Grey Mott, was chairman. The line, which was subsequently known as the City and South London Railway, ran between Monument and Stockwell in London. From 1886 Mott served as assistant engineer, pioneering the use of the Greathead shield and employing special techniques, including the use of low pressure compressed air, to overcome local problems of the water-bearing ground. On completion of tunnelling in 1887, Mott, as resident engineer, supervised the equipping and initial operation of the railway, which was originally intended for traction by means of endless wire ropes, but changed to be one of the first examples of electric traction. In the same year he married Florence Harmar (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of William Parker and an accomplished pianist; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Following the death of Greathead in 1896, Mott entered into partnership with Sir Benjamin Baker and shared responsibility for the design and construction of the second deep-level tube, the Central London Railway from Bank Station to Shepherd's Bush, which was opened in 1900. This line first introduced acceleration and deceleration gradients adjacent to stations, with appreciable savings in traction power. After Baker's death in 1907, Mott took into partnership David Hay and David Anderson, serving as senior partner of the firm of consulting engineers until his own death in 1938. In 1932, Mott, Hay, and Anderson were appointed as joint consultants (with Sir Harley Dalrymple-Hay in association with William Halcrow) to the London Passenger Transport Board. Following a visit to the United States, Mott was responsible for the introduction of escalators to Britain, after exhibiting a working escalator which was subsequently built into Earls Court Station. Much work followed for the London underground railways.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Mott was becoming prominent in bridge design, construction, and reconstruction. In 1906, he was associated with Baker with planning the widening of Blackfriars Bridge in London and subsequently responsible for execution of the work. He was responsible for the new Southwark Bridge, started in 1913 then stopped for the duration of the First World War and completed in 1921. He was also concerned with the widening of Kingston Bridge on the River Thames, the construction of Queensferry Bridge, a lifting bascule bridge, at Chester, the high-level road bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne, Wearmouth Bridge at Sunderland, and the Tees Bridge at Middlesbrough, the first vertical lift bridge in Britain.<br>
<br>After several years of controversy between the relative merits of bridge or tunnel, Mott, a strong advocate for a tunnel, had primary responsibility for the Mersey Tunnel, at the time the largest sub-aqueous tunnel in the world, which was constructed between 1925 and 1934. Extensive pioneering studies of ventilating a tunnel for petrol driven vehicles enlisted the assistance of J. S. Haldane. Mott was consulted by government and reported on many schemes, including the proposed Charing Cross Bridge, road bridges across the rivers Forth and Tay, and the channel tunnel. He was a member of the Severn barrage committee and chairman of the restoration works committee of engineers and architects for the preservation of the fabric of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Mott was admitted as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1895, elected a vice-president in 1920, and president in 1924. In his presidential address he commented that &#145;it is unfortunate that the existing tube railways [of London] have been constructed in a piecemeal fashion in accordance with ideas of individual promoters and their advisors, without regard to the interests of London as a whole&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 219, 1924&#150;15). He was appointed CB in 1918, created a baronet in 1930, and elected FRS in 1932. In 1933 he was elected a fellow of Imperial College of Science and Technology.<br>
<br>Mott was a kind, gentle, generous man, a strong character held in awe by his grandchildren. He suffered increasingly in later years from rheumatoid arthritis. He died of cancer at his home, 10 Arkwright Road, Hampstead, on 7 September 1938 and was succeeded as second baronet by his elder son, Adrian Spear (1889&#150;1964).<br>
