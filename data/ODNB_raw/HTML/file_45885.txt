<span class="headword">Cameron, Sir  Charles Alexander</span>  (1830&#150;1921), <span class="occ">public health officer</span>, was born on 16 July 1830 at Dublin, one of three children of Ewen Cameron (1787&#150;1846), soldier, and Belinda, daughter of John Smith of co. Cavan. He was educated privately in Dublin and Guernsey, where his family lived in 1844&#150;5. He studied medicine in Dublin and chemistry in Germany under Baron Liebig and was appointed professor to the Dublin Chemical Society at the age of twenty-three. As he noted himself, in one of his very few self-deprecatory observations, this was a pretentious title to give to the teacher of an unchartered private society. Cameron also lectured on chemistry and physics in three of Dublin's flourishing mid-nineteenth-century medical schools: Peter Street, Dr Steevens's, and the Ledwich. On 16 October 1862, at St Mary's Church, Donnybrook, Dublin, Cameron married Lucie Frances (<i>d</i>. 1883), only daughter of John Macnamara, solicitor, of Dublin. They had six sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Cameron obtained his first medical qualification, the licence of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland (subsequently the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland), in 1868, and he later became a member and honorary fellow of that body. He was awarded the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1874 and obtained a diploma in public health from Cambridge University three years later. Cameron was elected to the chair of hygiene in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1868 and to the professorship of chemistry in 1875, and held both appointments until his ninetieth year.<br>
<br>Cameron's most important work was in the area of public health. In 1862, he began his long connection with the municipal administration of Dublin when he was appointed public analyst. A few years later, he became medical officer of health and held this office until his death more than fifty years later. During this half-century of revolutionary change, Cameron played a key role in improving the living conditions of the Dublin poor. He was knighted in 1885 in recognition of his services to public health and was elevated to the companionship of the Bath in January 1899. He was awarded an honorary MD degree by the Royal University of Ireland in October 1896 and in September 1910 his work was publicly acknowledged by Dublin corporation when he was made an honorary freeman of the city, the capital's highest civic honour.<br>
<br>Cameron was closely associated with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland for many years and was elected president in 1885&#150;6. He published a monumental history of the college in 1886 and a revised, extended edition thirty years later. Cameron could rightly claim that this work was &#145;practically a history of Irish medicine and institutions from the earliest ages&#146; but, as one critic noted, his literary abilities did not match his industry. The same can be said of his tedious, octogenarian reminiscences and his factually inconsistent autobiography, which were published in 1913 and 1920 respectively. Cameron was on much firmer ground with the professional publications of a career spanning almost seventy years. Several monographs and scores of articles in the leading British and Irish medical, sanitary, and scientific journals are testimony to his intellectual curiosity, prolificacy, and versatility. In addition he produced a booklet on Irish freemasonry, a guide to the Dublin Zoological Gardens, and a volume of German poetry in translation. His unpublished writings include his diaries for the years 1880&#150;1916, which are in the archives of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.<br>
<br>Cameron was a Renaissance figure, interested alike in the scientific and the literary. He was, variously, theatre critic for the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, and joint owner, editor, and contributor to the <span class="italic">Agricultural Review</span>. A great socializer, he was at home in the clubs, drawing rooms, and salons of Dublin and London. He was a striking figure, full-bearded, and of imposing stature, a feature which may have owed something to his interest in gastronomy and fine wines. Witty, urbane, and gregarious, he was acquainted with singers and theatre folk, aristocrats, and members of the royal family. Cameron's politics were unionist and he subscribed to the tenets of the Church of Ireland. He was initiated into freemasonry on 22 December 1858 and was elected deputy grand master of the grand lodge of Ireland in 1911. He was also deputy grand master of the great priory of Ireland and sovereign grand commander of the supreme council 33rd degree, ancient and accepted rite for Ireland.<br>
<br>Cameron's last official assignment, at the age of eighty-six, was to inspect and report on the camp and buildings at Fron-goch, north Wales, where hundreds of participants in the 1916 rising were interned. He appeared &#145;immensely old&#146; to the youthful prisoners but, one of them recorded, &#145;his sharp intelligent face and keen piercing eyes gave indications of a mental alertness and acumen far beyond the ordinary&#146;  (Widdess, ix). Although the next five years took their inevitable physical toll, Cameron retained his full mental faculties to the very end. He died at his home, 27 Raglan Road, Dublin, on 27 February 1921 and was buried alongside his wife at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin, on 2 March. His gross assets at the time of his death were &pound;11,126 12<i>s.</i> 2<i>d</i>.<br>
