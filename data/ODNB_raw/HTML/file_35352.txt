<span class="headword">Page,  Thomas Ethelbert</span>  (1850&#150;1936), <span class="occ">classical scholar and schoolmaster</span>, was born at Lincoln on 27 March 1850, the second son of William Tomlinson Page, general manager of the Lincoln and Lindsey Banking Company, and his wife, Ann Watson. He attended Lincoln grammar school and Shrewsbury School before entering St John's College, Cambridge, in 1869. After a brilliant career as an undergraduate (he was ranked second classic in 1873), he became a sixth-form master at Charterhouse, where he managed a house and participated fully in school life. He held a fellowship of his college which he relinquished on his marriage, on 16 October 1875, to Delamotte Caroline Eugenie, only daughter of Edward Toynbee of Lincoln, a half-brother of Joseph Toynbee.<br>
<br>Page was the most prominent figure in the Association of Assistant Masters, and worked for fifty years to improve the conditions of teachers. In Godalming he served for thirty years on the town council, brought about the founding of Godalming grammar school, and was made an honorary freeman of the town in 1924. In addition, he edited Horace's <span class="italic">Odes</span> (1883), the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> (1886), and the whole of Virgil (1894). Thanks to their economy, humanity, and good sense, his editions remained in use for almost a hundred years. Page's scholarship was recognized in 1904, when Jebb asked him whether he would be willing to succeed Mayor as professor of Latin at Cambridge (Page had to say no, because his wife refused to leave Godalming), and again in 1913, when he received the degree of LittD from Manchester University. In his time at Charterhouse, Page was offered at least two headships (Harrow and Shrewsbury) on condition that he took holy orders. But although he was a devout Christian who prayed and read a chapter of his <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> every morning, Page objected to this stipulation; hence in spite of his fame as a teacher he was never promoted.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1910, Page was appointed first editor of the <span class="roman">Loeb Classical Library</span>. He selected (and rejected) translators from both sides of the Atlantic, and corrected their copy with a precision which was not always welcome. By 1935, along with his two colleagues (E. Capps and W. H. D. Rouse), he had supervised the preparation of some 200 volumes. As <span class="roman">Loeb</span> editor Page was paid &pound;800 a year in addition to his paltry pension of &pound;150 from Charterhouse. He also received a legacy of &pound;2000 from his father, had shares in Eastman Kodak, was a director of the Brentford Gas Company, and had interests in a hotel at Hindhead. In the end all this amounted to an estate of &pound;68,000&#151;a substantial sum in 1936. This financial comfort enabled him in later life to indulge the tastes of a man of the world. He enjoyed good food and drink, he attended race meetings at Ascot and Longchamp, and he was a welcome guest in the country houses and on the yachts of the well-to-do.<br>
<br>As an independently minded Liberal, who believed in the two great principles of individual freedom and individual responsibility, Page joined the Reform Club in 1890. There he became a familiar figure, with his tall stature (6 foot 2 inches), his deep voice with its short Lincolnshire &#145;a&#146;, his long hair and closely-clipped beard, and his unvarying dress (black boots, off-white trousers of St Kilda tweed, white shirt with navy blue poplin tie, black tailcoat and waistcoat). More important, his combination of knowledge, courtesy, and wit won him respect and affection among all the members. A special seat was reserved for him at luncheon, and his portrait, by Clive Gardiner, was hung there in 1927. Among his friends were Conan Doyle, Hilaire Belloc, Arnold Bennett, and also H. G. Wells, who called him &#145;King of the Reform Club&#146;. A wider reputation still resulted from his public speeches (especially during the First World War), his reviews in <span class="italic">The Bookman</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and his long series of letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In those letters he directed his powerful rhetorical satire against the Headmasters' Conference (for insisting that heads should be in holy orders), bishops (for upholding outmoded doctrines in the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and the Athanasian creed), and professors (for presuming to pronounce on teaching&#151;a craft of which they knew nothing). Nevertheless, on his eightieth birthday Page was presented with an amazing tribute, which included over 500 signatures from every part of the establishment&#151;British and American. In 1931 he became an honorary fellow of his old college; finally, in 1934, he was made a Companion of Honour. Owing to the dominant position of classics before 1918 and to his own outstanding qualities, Page reached an exceptional eminence in his profession. He died at his home at Woodcote, Godalming, Surrey, on 1 April 1936. He had two daughters.<br>
