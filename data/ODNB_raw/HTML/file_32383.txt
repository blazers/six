<span class="headword">Chauvel, Sir  Henry George</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 16 April 1865, at Tabulum, New South Wales, the second son of Charles Henry Edward Chauvel (1833&#150;1896), a grazier and cattle breeder, and his wife, Fanny Ada Mary (<i>d</i>. 1916), daughter of Henry Kerrison James of Sydney. He was educated at Sydney and Toowoomba grammar schools.<br>
<br>Chauvel hoped to follow a family tradition by joining the British army as soon as he had finished his schooling, but this intention was thwarted when the family farm suffered financial setback as a result of drought. Instead Chauvel undertook the management of one of his father's stations, as well as becoming an accomplished horseman. In 1888 the family moved to Darling Downs in Queensland. A change of career soon followed: in 1890 Chauvel was commissioned in the Queensland mounted infantry, and in 1896 appointed a captain in the Queensland permanent military forces. He travelled to Britain with a contingent for the celebration of Queen Victoria's jubilee in 1897, and spent a year training with the British army.<br>
<br>Chauvel then served with distinction as an officer with Australian cavalry in the South African War, participating in the relief of Kimberley and the advance on Pretoria and even, in action at Vet River, taking possession of a hostile machine gun. He returned to Australia in 1901, was appointed to the command of a battalion of horse formed by the newly established commonwealth of Australia, and returned to South Africa just as the war was ending. He was appointed CMG and mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Having again returned to Australia Chauvel spent the next decade training mounted troops (the light horse). On 16 June 1906 he married Sybil Campbell Keith, daughter of George Keith Jopp. They had four children&#151;two sons who followed him in a military career, and two daughters, one of whom, Elyne Mitchell, became a well-known writer. From 1911 Chauvel was involved in setting up the system of compulsory military service for home defence, as well as participating in the establishment of the Royal Military College at Duntroon. In 1914 he was on his way to Britain to become Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff when the First World War broke out. He served at the War Office in London until December, while waiting to take up command of the 1st light horse brigade then on its way to Britain as part of the Australian Imperial Force. His inspections of the camps on Salisbury Plain led him to conclude that they would not be in a fit condition by the time the Australians arrived, and his representations influenced the decision&#151;which was to have noteworthy consequences&#151;to disembark them in Egypt. Chauvel joined them there.<br>
<br>In April 1915 the Australian infantry participated in the invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula, only to be brought to a standstill by the terrain and the Turkish defenders. When the horsemen were called in as reinforcements, Chauvel and other officers prevailed on the authorities to send them as dismounted cavalry so as to preserve the integrity of their units. He arrived on the peninsula on 12 May and soon distinguished himself in command of some key sectors, maintaining contact with his troops and attending closely to the conditions of the trenches. Chauvel was appointed commander of a division in November, and oversaw its successful evacuation from the peninsula the following month.<br>
<br>After returning to Egypt Chauvel was promoted major-general and offered command of a division then in the process of transferring to France. Instead he opted to stay as head of the newly formed Australian and New Zealand mounted division. In mid-1916 this force played a part in warding off Turkish attacks directed at the Suez Canal, including the operation at Romani on 4&#150;5 August in which Chauvel contributed significantly to the plan whereby the Turks were allowed to come on and then struck decisively in the flank by his mounted troops. Continuing the pursuit towards Palestine, he defeated the Turks at Rafa and Magdhaba in December 1916 and at Rafa in January 1917. He then participated in what was nearly a further success against the fortress of Gaza, commanding the coast road into Palestine, in March 1917, before an over-anxious British command obliged the cavalry to withdraw with victory almost in hand. In April he became a corps commander and in August lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>Sir Edmund Allenby, appointed commander in Palestine in June 1917, launched a new campaign in which he entrusted Chauvel with the mounted operations. In a daring charge of 31 October against reduced Turkish forces, Chauvel's light horse overran Beersheba and captured its water wells intact. This action turned the Gaza line. Chauvel was appointed KCB. Less successful were attacks on Derra against stiffened Turkish resistance late in April 1918. Then in September occurred another striking triumph, at Megiddo. First Allenby's infantry broke through on the coast. Then Chauvel's mounted forces swept into the breach, encircling and capturing the greater part of two Turkish armies. He then pressed on to Damascus, which he reached on 1 October just after the arrival of an Arab force led by T. E. Lawrence (who, with scant cause, wrote dismissively of Chauvel in <span class="italic">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</span>). Chauvel then proceeded to Aleppo. There was little fighting during this last phase, a fortunate development given that his troops were becoming gravely affected by typhus and malaria.<br>
<br>The Turks capitulated at the end of October. In the preceding six weeks Chauvel's mounted forces had, for losses of only 650 men, taken 78,000 prisoners and advanced between 300 and 500 miles. Even against a demoralized enemy, this was an impressive performance in inhospitable campaigning territory. It bore witness to Chauvel's thorough planning and responsible logistical arrangements.<br>
<br>Chauvel returned to Australia in 1919. He was appointed GCMG, and given the post of inspector-general. In 1923 he became chief of the general staff. This was a time of severe economic stringency, and it was in some measure thanks to Chauvel's guidance that the diminished and under-equipped Australian army remained in good spirits.<br>
<br>Chauvel retired with much honour in April 1930. That same year he became a lay canon of St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne, a token of his lifelong Christian religious observance. He held business directorships until his death, and devoted much time to causes relating to former servicemen. After his death in Melbourne on 4 March 1945 he was accorded a state funeral.<br>
<br>Chauvel was a shy man, but one who in battle remained calm in stressful situations. His caution in some engagements in Palestine attracted criticism. But he was unwilling to squander the lives of his men. And he was powerfully aware that the dangers inherent in desert operations, where failure in such matters as ensuring access to water supplies could spell disaster, required of him caution and meticulous organization. One of his most noteworthy military operations, the charge of the Australian light horse against Turkish positions at Beersheba, twice featured in major Australian films, one of which, <span class="italic">Forty Thousand Horsemen</span> (1940), was directed by his nephew, the eminent Australian film-maker Charles Chauvel.<br>
