<span class="headword">Musgrave, Sir  James</span>, baronet  (1826&#150;1904), <span class="occ">industrialist and philanthropist</span>, was born at Lisburn, co. Antrim, Ireland, on 30 December 1826, the seventh of nine sons (and one of the twelve children) of Dr Samuel Musgrave (1770&#150;1836), a leading physician of Lisburn, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1862), daughter of William Riddel, of Comber, co. Down. The Musgrave family had come to Ulster from Cumberland in the seventeenth century. Musgrave's father, who sympathized with the United Irishmen, was arrested on 16 September 1796 on a charge of high treason and imprisoned in the new gaol, Dublin. Released in 1798, he resumed professional work in Lisburn; but in 1803 he was again arrested and imprisoned for a time on a similar charge.<br>
<br>After attending local schools and receiving private tuition, Musgrave began early a business career in Belfast, and ultimately, with two of his brothers, John Riddel and Robert, he established the important firm of Musgrave Brothers, iron founders and engineers. Taking part in the public life of Belfast, he was in 1876 elected one of the Belfast harbour commissioners, and was subsequently regularly re-elected, serving as a chairman of the commission from 1887 to 1903. Under Musgrave's direction the harbour was greatly improved, and new docks, quays, and deep water channels constructed for the increasing trade, one of these being named the Musgrave Channel in his honour.<br>
<br>In 1877 Musgrave was elected president of the Belfast chamber of commerce. The moving spirit in the establishment of the Belfast Technical School, he helped greatly in the erection of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, in commemoration of the jubilee of Queen Victoria, and founded in 1901 the Musgrave chair of pathology in Queen's College, Belfast. Musgrave worked hard as a member of the Recess Committee, formed in 1895 by Sir Horace Plunkett to devise means for the improvement of the agricultural and economic condition of Ireland, and whose proposals were embodied in 1899 in an act of parliament.<br>
<br>In 1866 Musgrave and his brother John purchased an estate of some 60,000 acres in co. Donegal. During part of every year he resided on the estate at Carrick Lodge, Glencolumbkille, taking a personal interest in the welfare of the tenants. He was appointed JP and deputy lieutenant of co. Donegal, and served as high sheriff in 1885&#150;6. He was chairman of the Donegal Railway Company, in the establishment of which he had a large share. In 1897 he was created a baronet of the United Kingdom. Musgrave, who was unmarried, died at his home, Drumglass House, Belfast, on 22 February 1904, and was buried in the cathedral churchyard, Lisburn. A stained-glass window to his memory, and to that of other members of the family, was put up in the First Lisburn Presbyterian Church, to which his ancestors belonged.<br>
