<span class="headword">Madden,  Cecil Charles</span>  (1902&#150;1987), <span class="occ">radio and television producer</span>, was born on 29 November 1902 at the British consulate in Mogador, Morocco, the eldest of three sons (there were no daughters) of Archibald Maclean Madden CMG, diplomatist, and his wife, Cecilia Catherine, daughter of Allen Page Moor, canon of Truro. He was educated at French schools in Morocco, schools in Spain, and in England at Aldeburgh Lodge preparatory school and Dover College. He acquired fluent French and Spanish. While working in a secretarial post with the Rio Tinto Company in Spain, he wrote revues in Spanish and played Freddy Eynsford Hill in a translation of George Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span>. Four times a year his professional duties took him to New York, where he saw Broadway productions in his free time.<br>
<br>Between 1926 and 1932 every holiday was spent in Paris working in theatre management. Although Madden encountered famous stars such as Fernandel, Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, and Miss Bluebell, he was very proud of the fact that he improved backstage conditions for the chorus girls. As well as writing revues in French and Spanish, he wrote several plays in English.<br>
<br>In June 1932 Madden married Muriel Emily, daughter of Brigadier-General James Kilvington Cochrane; they had a son and daughter. In 1933 he joined the BBC talks department, where he produced a series entitled <span class="italic">Anywhere for a News Story</span> and subsequently produced the outside broadcasting spot on a popular Saturday evening programme, <span class="italic">In Town Tonight</span>.<br>
<br>Madden subsequently worked as a senior producer in the new empire (later overseas) service of the BBC, and in 1936 joined Gerald Cock, the recently appointed first head of the BBC's television service. In August 1936 they were told to prepare programmes to open the first high definition service in the world on 2 November. Plans changed and Madden was told to produce a show to be transmitted to Radiolympia in ten days' time. <span class="italic">Here's looking at you</span> was seen by visitors to the exhibition and the few television set owners then living around London. Madden then created <span class="italic">Picture Page</span>, a magazine programme transmitted from Alexandra Palace on the official opening of the television service. From 2 November 1936, until television shut down on 1 September 1939, Madden organized and produced live programmes of variety, ballets, and drama, as well as Disney cartoons. &#145;A play a day&#146; was his motto. He created the series <span class="italic">100% Broadway</span>, <span class="italic">Cabaret Cartoons</span>, and <span class="italic">Starlight</span>.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Madden returned to radio, and in 1940 was made head of the overseas entertainment unit in the Criterion Theatre, broadcasting all radio programmes to British Commonwealth forces serving abroad. He presented the <span class="italic">American Eagle in Britain</span> programme from 17 November 1940 to 9 September 1945, earning the title of the &#145;GI's friend&#146;. General Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the studio on 2 March 1944; on 7 June (D-day plus one) his brainchild, the allied expeditionary forces programme (AEF) of the BBC, began with Madden in charge of the integrated production. This programme informed and entertained its listeners until 25 July 1945. Artists included Gertrude Lawrence, Marlene Dietrich, George Raft, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope. Major Glenn Miller conducted the American band of AEF until he disappeared in December 1944, Madden being the last civilian to see him alive. He was also the man responsible for discovering Petula Clark in 1942 and the Beverley Sisters in 1944.<br>
<br>When television reopened on 7 June 1946, Madden returned to his former post of programmes organizer. In 1950 he was made acting head of children's programmes until April 1951. He then became assistant to the controller of television programmes and created <span class="italic">Picture Parade</span>, a magazine programme dealing with the film industry. He was also involved with a series of excerpts from West End plays, including <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span>.<br>
<br>Madden retired from the BBC in 1964, but he continued other activities, as a governor of Dulwich College preparatory school, and president of both the Glenn Miller Society and the British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild. His interest in young entrants to the profession was reflected in his work for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), as vice-chairman of the RADA Associates. He was involved with the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and took part in the National Film School. His personal scrapbooks, containing records of television since 1936, aided research for the &#145;fifty years of television&#146; celebrations in November 1986, when he was videoed from the studio at Alexandra Palace on 2 November. In the Museum of Film, Photography, and Television at Bradford he is commemorated in a life-sized model, seated in the gallery at Alexandra Palace. He was a BAFTA award winner (1961) and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (1950). In 1952 he was appointed MBE. Madden laid the foundation of British television, always with taste and high standards. His popularity with those who worked with him was not always shared by the BBC administration. With his sound knowledge of theatre he was a discoverer of talent as well as an innovator.<br>
<br>Madden was tall, slim, and always immaculately dressed. He was charming, courteous, dignified, and had a great sense of fun, which prevented him from being pompous. Madden died in Westminster Hospital, London, on 27 May 1987.<br>
