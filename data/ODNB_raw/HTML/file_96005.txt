<span class="headword">Donaldson,  John Francis</span>, Baron Donaldson of Lymington  (1920&#150;2005), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 6 October 1920 at 6 King Street, St Marylebone, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57888/', "Malcolm Donaldson (1884&#150;1973)")</script>, consultant gynaecologist, and his first wife, Evelyn Helen Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gilroy. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a lower second-class degree in law. He became secretary of debates in the Cambridge Union and acted as chairman of the Federation of University Conservative and Unionist Associations. Called up in 1941, he served with the Royal Signals and the guards armoured divisional signals for the remainder of the Second World War, rising to the rank of captain. It was during the war that he met (Dorothy) Mary Warwick [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92578/', "Donaldson, Dame (Dorothy) Mary, Lady Donaldson of Lymington (1921&#150;2003)")</script>], who was then working as a nurse. She later became the first woman to be lord mayor of London, in 1983. They had two daughters, Margaret-Ann (<i>b</i>. 1946) and Jennifer Mary (<i>b</i>. 1948), and a son, Michael (<i>b</i>. 1950). In 1945&#150;6 Donaldson worked in the allied military government of Schleswig-Holstein before being demobilized with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Donaldson was called to the bar in 1946 as a Harmsworth scholar at Middle Temple. He joined the chambers of Henry Willink at 3 Essex Court, which specialized in shipping, marine insurance, and banking. There he built up a thriving commercial practice and initiated his lifelong enthusiasm for maritime law, perhaps arising from his love of sailing. He was a joint editor of <span class="italic">Lowndes and Rudolf on General Average</span> for the eighth, ninth, and tenth editions (1955&#150;75). He found time to take an active part in local politics and was an Independent Ratepayer councillor in Croydon between 1949 and 1953. He was also a member of the Bar Council from 1956 to 1961. He took silk in 1961 and was appointed a judge of the queen's bench division in 1966, on the recommendation of Lord Gardiner. One of his early decisions was <i>Baker v. Willoughby</i> (1969), on the allocation of damages between successive tortfeasors.<br>
<br>Donaldson had taken an early interest in the reform of industrial relations, contributing to the influential <span class="italic">A Giant's Strength</span>, published in 1958 by the Inns of Court Conservative Association. Edward Heath's Conservative government, elected in 1970, was pledged to take action against trade-union power. This included restraints on the right to strike and a legal framework for settling disputes over unfair dismissal. Donaldson assisted in drafting the <span class="roman">Industrial Relations Act</span> 1971. This complex legislation established a National Industrial Relations Court, and Donaldson became its first (and only) president. His vision was strongly managerial. The court would be informal, with no wigs or gowns, and would welcome an early opportunity of involvement in the hope it could nip disputes in the bud. As he used to boast, it was &#145;the fastest court in the west&#146;. In characteristic fashion he issued a <i>Presidential Statement</i> (1972) to mark the opening of the court:<blockquote>Once the court and each party knows what the essence of the dispute is about, arrangements will be made for a speedy investigation of the dispute. At this stage procedures will differ according to circumstances, but a common procedure will be to invite the parties to an informal meeting with the court at which the best method of hearing and determining the issues can be selected. At such a meeting it will be possible to find out what are the real issues&#151;what the case is really about&#151;and to do so much more quickly, cheaply and effectively than by a lengthy exchange of formal documents.</blockquote>Donaldson cherished the independence of his presidency. Years later he told the House of Lords about an encounter with Robert Carr, Edward Heath's employment secretary:<blockquote>[Carr] asked me, &#145;To whom are you responsible as President?&#146; I understood him to be referring to the National Industrial Relations Court. He said, &#145;I take it that you are responsible to the Lord Chief Justice&#146;. I said, &#145;Certainly not&#146;. He said, &#145;Then, to the Lord Chancellor&#146;. I said, &#145;Certainly not. I am responsible solely to my conscience and to the law&#146;. (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 596.1149, 28 Jan 1999)</blockquote>As the court's president, Donaldson was exposed to attack as the government's personal instrument in curbing trade unionism. Matters quickly came to a head with a series of disputes over containerization in the docks. In <i>Heatons Transport (St Helens) Ltd v. T&amp;GWU</i> (1972) Donaldson's court fined the union for the &#145;unofficial&#146; action of its shop stewards in blacking container depots. That decision was overturned on appeal, Lord Denning holding that the stewards' actions were not the union's responsibility since they had not been authorized by the national executive. Donaldson immediately told the lord chief justice, Lord Widgery, that he could not continue as president if the Denning decision was allowed to stand since it would create individual martyrs. Before the matter could be resolved, five London dockers refused to obey an injunction to cease unlawful picketing at a depot. Donaldson felt he had no option but to gaol them for contempt. Predictably, London dockers and print workers went on strike in support of the &#145;Pentonville five&#146;. Within days the House of Lords had overturned the Court of Appeal decision in <i>Heatons</i>, clearing the way for the intervention of the official solicitor and the dockers' release. Donaldson was embroiled in fresh controversy in 1973, when he ordered sequestration of the funds of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers for refusing to call off a strike at a small Surrey engineering factory. An early day motion was signed by 182 Labour MPs calling Donaldson's action &#145;an act of political prejudice and partiality&#146; and urging that he be sacked  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Dec 1973).<br>
<br>The Labour government elected in 1974 made repeal of the 1971 act a priority. His presidency abolished, Donaldson returned to the High Court. He officiated in some prominent criminal trials, notably those of the &#145;Guildford four&#146; in 1975 and the &#145;Maguire seven&#146; in 1976. These were high-profile miscarriages of justice, in which police witnesses had lied and forensic evidence favourable to the defence had been suppressed, though it was more than a decade before the miscarriages were acknowledged; Sir John May, appointed by the government to inquire into the Maguire trial, found in 1990 that Donaldson had misunderstood and mishandled critical evidence.<br>
<br>When Margaret Thatcher came to office in 1979 she promoted Donaldson to lord justice almost immediately, and in 1982 he succeeded Lord Denning as master of the rolls. He soon showed himself to be a champion of reform of civil procedure in the interests of closer case management and greater efficiency. He introduced skeleton arguments in civil appeals, and the practice of handing down judgments, which had until then routinely been read out in open court. He initiated the publication of an annual report on the work of the Court of Appeal. In 1988 he was made a life peer, as Baron Donaldson of Lymington.<br>
<br>It was characteristic that, given the opportunity, Donaldson favoured the extension of judicial review jurisdiction to cover a wide range of regulatory bodies. In <i>R v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin Plc</i> (1987) the Court of Appeal extended the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to any body exercising what were in effect public powers judicially when the source of its power was not purely contractual. His ruling in <i>Sutcliffe v. Pressdram Ltd</i> (1991) set the trend towards limiting jury awards in libel cases, regarded as a considerable fetter on press freedom. In <i>M v. Home Office</i> (1992), where the Conservative home secretary, Kenneth Baker, ignored an order to return a man deported to Zaire in defiance of an undertaking given to the Divisional Court, Donaldson held him personally in contempt. Donaldson held that ministers and civil servants were accountable to the law and to the courts for their personal actions and could be proceeded against for contempt of court. &#145;It would be a black day for the rule of law and the liberty of the subject if ministers were not accountable to the courts for their personal actions&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 2 Sept 2005). It demonstrated his boldness as a constitutional innovator and his reluctance to see the court's powers in its own sphere fettered or diminished. He displayed a similar boldness in <i>X v. Morgan-Grampian</i> (1991), where the appellant journalist was defying a court order to name the source of his story. Donaldson refused to hear the appellant while he was in contempt of court. The decision was subsequently reversed by the House of Lords, which found that the contemner was entitled to challenge the court's jurisdiction to make the order.<br>
<br>Donaldson retired as master of the rolls in 1992. He was called in to undertake a number of important marine inquiries, writing <span class="italic">Safer Ships: Cleaner Seas</span> (1994), a report on the prevention of maritime pollution, examining the sinking of the oil tanker MV <i>Braer</i> in 1993 and the loss of the <i>Aegean Sea</i> the previous year. In 1995 he was asked to investigate the disappearance of the bulk carrier MV <i>Derbyshire</i> off the Japanese coast in 1980. It was his firm advocacy of an expedition to find the wreckage of the carrier and discover why it had sunk that eventually, in 2000, resolved what had been a great mystery for some twenty years. Donaldson's review of salvage and intervention following the <span class="italic">Sea Empress</span> disaster in 1996 uncovered serious deficiencies in the provision for dealing with oil spillages at sea and led to important changes in the supervision of oil rigs and tankers.<br>
<br>After 1997, with a Labour majority in the Commons apparently bent on abolishing hunting with dogs, Donaldson became exercised about the role of the House of Lords. In 2000 he introduced the <span class="roman">Parliament Acts (Amendment) Bill</span> in the Lords on the premise that the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> of 1949 was of doubtful validity. He worried that the House of Commons might use the <span class="roman">Parliament Acts</span> to extend the life of a parliament beyond five years. One of his last speeches, in February 2004, was a trenchant critique of proposals to abolish the office of lord chancellor and replace the judicial committee of the House of Lords with a supreme court.<br>
<br>Standing more than six feet tall, and bespectacled, Donaldson was known for sucking boiled sweets in court and wearing his judicial wig at an angle. His hobbies were sailing and do-it-yourself: &#145;He's a dreadful embarrassment in people's houses&#146;, his wife said. &#145;He fishes out his penknife and tightens loose screws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 2 Sept 2005). He died suddenly on 31 August 2005 at his home, 5 Kingsfield, Lymington, Hampshire, after a heart attack. He was survived by his three children.<br>
