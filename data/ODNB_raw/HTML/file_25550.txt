<span class="headword">Silvester, Sir  Philip Carteret</span>, second baronet  (1777&#150;1828), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4806/', "Rear-Admiral Philip Carteret (1733&#150;1796)")</script>, the circumnavigator, and his wife, Marie Rachel (<i>d</i>. in or after 1797), daughter of Sir John Baptist Silvester (<i>d</i>. 1789), born in France but educated in the Netherlands, and physician to the British army in the Low Countries, under the duke of Cumberland, during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740&#150;48). His mother's brother, whose title and name he eventually inherited, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67764/', "Sir John Silvester, first baronet (1745&#150;1822)")</script>.<br>
<br>Philip Carteret entered the navy in 1792 under the care of his father's old lieutenant, Captain Erasmus Gower, on the <i>Lion</i>, in which he went out to China, and returned in 1794. He was then with Gower in the <i>Triumph</i> (74 guns) and was slightly wounded in the partial engagement with the French fleet on 17 June 1795. On 8 October of that year he was promoted lieutenant of the frigate <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i>; he afterwards served in the <i>Greyhound</i>, <i>Britannia</i>, and <i>Cambrian</i> in the English Channel and on the coast of France; and on 29 April 1802 he was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Bonne Citoyenne</i> in the Mediterranean. She was paid off in 1803, and the following year he was appointed to the brig <i>Scorpion</i> (18 guns), in which he served in the North Sea, and on 11 April 1805 captured a Dutch vessel bound for the West Indies with a cargo of arms and military stores. In December 1805 he was sent out to the West Indies, where, during the greater part of 1806, he watched and sent intelligence of the French squadron under Willaumez, so that it was not until his return to England in spring 1807 that he received his commission as post captain, dated 22 January 1806.<br>
<br>In 1809 Carteret served as a volunteer on the <i>Superb</i>, flagship of Sir Richard Goodwin Keats, in the expedition to the Scheldt, where his conduct, especially in covering the evacuation of Walcheren, was highly commended by Sir Richard John Strachan, the commander-in-chief, and Commodore Owen, in actual command of the operations. In summer 1811 Carteret was appointed to the frigate <i>Naiad</i> (46 guns), in which on 20 September he was off Boulogne when a division of the French flotilla got under way and stood along the coast under the eyes of Napoleon, who on the next day witnessed a detachment of this division cut off, brought to action, and captured by the <i>Naiad</i> with three gun-brigs in company. The rest of the division escaped under the guns of the batteries which lined the coast.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1812 Carteret was moved into the frigate <i>Pomone</i> (46 guns), employed on the coast of France and the Lisbon station. On 21 October 1813, in hazy weather in the Bay of Biscay, she fell in with a French frigate under jury masts, much disabled by a recent gale, and at the same time sighted another large ship which was supposed to be also a frigate. Carteret went to engage her, but found she was a Portuguese East Indiaman. Meanwhile the disabled French frigate had escaped, only to be captured, after very feeble resistance, by the <i>Andromache</i> two days later. At Lisbon it was reported that the <i>Pomone</i> had fled from the frigate, and Carteret applied for a court martial, which was held, on his return to Plymouth, on 31 December. He was acquitted of all blame and continued in command of the <i>Pomone</i> until the end of the war. On 4 June 1815 he was made a CB and about the same time was appointed to the <i>D&eacute;sir&eacute;e</i> (36 guns), from which in October he was moved to the <i>Active</i> (38 guns). In her he served two years on the Jamaica station. After returning in autumn 1817 he had no further employment. In January 1822 he took the name of Silvester in addition to Carteret, and on the death of his uncle, Sir John Silvester, without issue, on 30 March 1822, he succeeded to the baronetcy, by a special clause in the patent. He died, unmarried, of &#145;apoplexy&#146;, at Leamington, Warwickshire, on 24 August 1828, when the title became extinct; he was interred at the parish church at Leamington.<br>
