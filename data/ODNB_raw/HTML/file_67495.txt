<span class="headword">Engleheart,  Francis</span>  (1775&#150;1849), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 28 July 1775 in London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8816/', "Thomas Engleheart (bap. 1745, d. 1809)")</script>, a sculptor, and his wife, Ann Wade (1753&#150;1779), whom he married on 8 October 1774. He was educated in Hertford and London at Christ's Hospital, where he was admitted on 12 May 1784 from Richmond, his father being described as a needlemaker. On 7 December 1790, for a fee of &pound;52, he was apprenticed to the engraver Joseph Collyer (1748&#150;1827), and later he assisted James Heath, a former Collyer apprentice. On 22 May 1799 he married Jane Diana (<i>b</i>. 1771), the daughter of Joseph Le Petit, at St Marylebone, Marylebone Road; the couple had a daughter, Sarah Jane (<i>bap</i>. 3 Sept 1800) and two sons, Timothy Stansfeld and <a href="#cosubject_67495">Jonathan Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Engleheart worked mainly in line. Among his earliest plates was <span class="italic">General Fairfax</span>, after Bowers (1808). Between 1810 and 1812 he engraved part of <span class="italic">The Canterbury Pilgrims</span>, after Thomas Stothard, begun by Luigi Schiavonetti (<i>d</i>. 1810), finished by James Heath, and published in 1817. He achieved notice by engraving some of Richard Cook's designs for several publications, notably Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> and <span class="italic">The Castle</span> for Walter Scott's <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>. Cadell and Davies commissioned Robert Smirke to produce designs for their publications, after which Engleheart engraved, for example, three for Le Sage's <span class="italic">Gil Blas</span>, first published in 1809, and about thirty for Cervantes' <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> in 1818. Eleven subjects from <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> were exhibited at W. B. Cooke's exhibition of engravings in 1821, together with <span class="italic">A Gentleman</span>, after William Owen, and three plates from Scott's <span class="italic">Poems</span>, after Richard Westall and Stothard. Engleheart was then living at 2 Bayham Street, Camden Town. His work on steel began with the annuals, for example, the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span> (1826&#150;32), <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> (1829&#150;34), <span class="italic">The Amulet</span> (1827), <span class="italic">The Gem</span>, and <span class="italic">Wreath of Friendship</span>. Engleheart's engraving after a self-portrait by Hans Holbein was reproduced in Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting</span> (1827), and a vignette of a lute player after Parmigiano was engraved for Samuel Rogers's <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1834. Engleheart etched plates for the <span class="italic">Description of the Collection of Ancient Marbles in the British Museum</span> (1812&#150;45), as did his son Timothy. F. G. Moon published Engleheart's engravings of David Wilkie's <span class="italic">Duncan Gray</span> and <span class="italic">The Only Daughter</span> (<i>c</i>.1835&#150;1839). His last and most important production was <span class="italic">Serena Rescued by the Red-Cross Knight</span>, after William Hilton, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> in 1846. His plates were signed &#145;F. Engleheart&#146;. The number of plates produced was not great, but their regular appearance over a period of time indicated some popularity with the publishers. Engleheart died after a short illness on 15 February 1849 in his seventy-fourth year.<br>
<br>His elder son, <a name="cosubject_8817"></a><span class="headword">Timothy Stansfeld Engleheart</span>  (1803&#150;1879), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was probably his father's pupil. In 1818 he was awarded the silver Isis medal of the Society of Arts for an outline drawing of the Farnese Hercules; his address was then Bayham Street, Camden Town. He and his wife, Ann, had two sons, Stansfeld (<i>bap</i>. 14 Nov 1833) and Francis James (<i>bap</i>. 8 Aug 1834), and one daughter, Lucy Mary (<i>bap</i>. 27 April 1837). He worked for annuals such as <span class="italic">The Casket</span>, <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span>, and the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span>. Two plates were done for William Hogarth's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1833), and <span class="italic">The Black Linn of Linklater</span>, after Alexander Chisholm, for G. N. Wright's <span class="italic">Landscape-Historical Illustrations of Scotland</span> (1836&#150;8). Engleheart moved to Germany as a portrait engraver and about 1840 engraved <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span>, after G. Reni, at Darmstadt. Six steel-engravings after German artists were done for <span class="italic">Rheinisches Taschenbuch</span>, published at Frankfurt by Sauerlander (1842), and in J. J. Sievers's <span class="italic">A Russian Statesman</span> his engraved portrait of Prince Besborodko was signed with his name and &#145;sc. Darmstadt&#146;. His plates were signed &#145;T. S. Engleheart&#146;. He later returned to London, where he died in 1879 aged seventy-six.<br>
<br>Francis Engleheart's younger son, <a name="cosubject_67495"></a><span class="headword">Jonathan Henry Engleheart</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1808, <em>d.</em> after 1841), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was baptized at St Marylebone on 20 January 1808, and was also probably his father's pupil. His landscape work came to the fore with <span class="italic">Cardiff Castle</span>, after Henry Gastineau, in the latter's <span class="italic">Wales Illustrated</span> (1830), and in T. Rose's <span class="italic">Westmorland</span> (1832) he did two plates after George Pickering. <span class="italic">Col. Maxwell's Last Charge at Assaye</span>, after Abraham Cooper, engraved for W. H. Maxwell's <span class="italic">Life of the Duke of Wellington</span> (1839&#150;41), was signed &#145;J<sup>no</sup> H. Engleheart&#146;, though most of his work was signed &#145;J. Engleheart&#146;, or occasionally &#145;J. H. Engleheart&#146;. From 1839 he engraved plates for the <span class="italic">Sporting Review</span>.<br>
