<span class="headword">Hook,  James</span>  (1772?&#150;1828), <span class="occ">dean of Worcester</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13683/', "James Hook (1746&#150;1827)")</script>, organist, and his first wife, Elizabeth Jane Madden (<i>d</i>. 1795); he was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13686/', "Theodore Edward Hook")</script>. He was born in London, probably in 1772 (his son's biographer says June 1771, but as he is recorded to have entered Westminster School in 1788 at the age of fifteen, and to have died in February 1828, aged fifty-five, this cannot be the case). While at Westminster he edited the school magazine, <span class="italic">The Trifler</span>, and by an unlucky attempt to satirize Eton provoked a blistering response from George Canning on the &#145;heavy fellows&#146; of Westminster in <span class="italic">The Microcosm</span>, the Etonian magazine. He inherited his father's skill in music and his mother's skill in painting: as a young man he wrote the librettos of two of his father's musical entertainments, &#145;Jack of Newbury&#146; and &#145;Diamond Cut Diamond&#146;, which were performed, but never printed; his juvenile sketches, which included a set of caricatures of leading public men, induced Sir Joshua Reynolds to recommend that he should be educated as an artist. In 1792 he was a candidate for election from Westminster School to Christ Church, Oxford, but was excluded for &#145;acts of insubordination&#146;, to which he had also invited others. He proceeded to Oxford nevertheless, and graduated from St Mary Hall in 1796. In the same year, yielding to the strong wish of his mother, he took holy orders, and in the following year contracted an advantageous marriage with Anne (<i>d</i>. 1844), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9181/', "Sir Walter Farquhar, bt")</script>, physician and confidential friend of the prince of Wales, whose private chaplain he became.<br>
<br>Hook's rise in the church was consequently very rapid. After having held livings in Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, and Hertfordshire he became in 1814 archdeacon of Huntingdon, in 1817 rector of Whippingham in the Isle of Wight, and in 1825 dean of Worcester, an appointment bringing with it two valuable livings. He did not enjoy it long, dying at the deanery, Worcester, on 5 February 1828. He was buried in the south aisle of the cathedral, and his epitaph was written by the bishop (Folliott H. W. Cornewall). Notwithstanding his accumulated preferment, he left his family in straitened circumstances. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13687/', "Walter Farquhar Hook")</script> was his son.<br>
<br>Hook published <span class="italic">Anguis in herba</span> (1802), a defence of the clergy against certain imputations and an attack on Methodism and Jacobinism; he also published sermons and charges. The review of Thomas Moore's &#145;Loves of the Angels&#146;, published among his brother's works, is probably from his pen. He was also author of a pamphlet against Thomas Paine and other revolutionary writers, signed Publicola; of <span class="italic">Al Kalomeric: an Arabian Tale</span> (1814), satirizing Napoleon; and of <span class="italic">The Good Old Times, or, The Poor Man's History of England</span> (1817). His anonymous novels, <span class="italic">Pen Owen</span> (1822) and <span class="italic">Percy Mallory</span> (1824), are similar in style to his brother's. The former, which is considerably the better, has a lively portrait of R. B. Sheridan as Tom Sparkle, and a spirited description of the Cato Street conspiracy.<br>
