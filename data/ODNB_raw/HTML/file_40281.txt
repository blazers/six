<span class="headword">Arnot,  Robert Page <span class="st"> [Robin]</span></span>  (1890&#150;1986), <span class="occ">political activist and historian</span>, was born at 8 South Street, Greenock, Renfrewshire, on 15 December 1890, the son of John Arnot, a newspaper sub-editor who had begun work as a child in an iron foundry but became editor of the <span class="italic">Greenock Telegraph</span>, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall. His forebears were agricultural labourers and linen weavers, and he was the grandson of a Chartist. Learning and reading were encouraged at home and his father had many books. Aged twelve Robin (as he was always known) read William Morris's <span class="italic">News from Nowhere</span> and so began a lifelong passion for Morris and socialism, further fuelled when at about sixteen he heard the Clydeside Marxist John MacLean speak. In 1908, having gained school examination passes in English, higher mathematics, higher Latin, Greek, and French, Arnot was admitted to Glasgow University, where he studied Greek and Latin, passing both at the higher level. In 1912 he withdrew from political economy and gained third-class honours in both English and history, graduating MA.<br>
<br>Arnot's political activism began at university, where he joined the Glasgow University Fabian Society in 1908, and in 1912 became a founder and secretary of the University Socialist Federation (continuing as secretary until 1919). He moved to London and in 1914 became secretary of the Fabian research department (FRD). He wrote numerous pamphlets, trained researchers, and assisted the miners', engineers', and railwaymen's unions with political and economic information, especially at government inquiries. From 1915 editing the <span class="italic">Labour Yearbook</span> brought him into contact with unions and future leaders of the Communist Party&#151;Rajani Palme Dutt, William Gallacher, and others. In this early period, Arnot was very close to G. D. H. Cole, with whom he wrote <span class="italic">Trade Unionism on the Railways</span> (1917), and William Mellor. Beatrice Webb called them the &#145;kernel&#146; of the FRD and &#145;professional rebels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9 March 1916). On 1 January 1916 he married Leila Ogier Ward (<i>b</i>. 1889/90), the daughter of Allan Ogier Ward, a doctor of medicine; they had a daughter.<br>
<br>Arnot avoided military service during the First World War and was imprisoned in 1917&#150;18 for eighteen months for his anti-militarism. After his release he and Cole wrested control of the FRD from the Fabians and in 1918 it was renamed the Labour Research Department (LRD), Arnot remaining secretary until 1927. In 1919 he compiled much of the evidence presented by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) to the Sankey commission on the coal industry. In the early 1920s the LRD was fully taken over by the Communist Party and G. D. H. Cole resigned. Arnot was on its executive committee from about 1930. At the LRD he met Olive Elizabeth Budden (<i>b</i>. 1892/3), the daughter of Edwin Budden, a schoolmaster. His first wife having died some time previously, they married on 11 October 1935. Olive became a frequent lecturer for the Communist Party.<br>
<br>In 1920 Arnot was a delegate from the Guild Communist Group to the conferences which formed the Communist Party of Great Britain, and was thus a foundation member of the party. In 1921, as a friend and close associate of Dutt, he helped found the <span class="italic">Labour Monthly</span> and served on its editorial board, becoming associate editor from 1941 until 1950 when he resigned to continue his historical writing. In November 1925 he was among the twelve communist leaders imprisoned for conspiracy to publish seditious libels, Arnot being sentenced to six months. He was, however, released before the 1926 general strike and was an active organizer among miners in the north-east, an experience which intensified his radicalism. In 1926 he compiled a valuable book of documents on the general strike, and by 1927 he had completed a draft of his history of the MFGB, covering 1889 to 1910, which had been sanctioned by the union in 1925. Probably for political reasons (in the late 1920s the MFGB had moved to a stronger anti-communist line), its publication was delayed for twenty years.<br>
<br>Arnot attended the Third World Congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1921 and became a trusted figure in Moscow. Dmitry Manuilsky of the Comintern asserted that Arnot and Dutt were the only correct theoreticians in the British party  (Pelling, 51). Arnot also joined the Soviet party, and held various Moscow postings: in 1929 he was assistant director of the eastern department of the executive committee of the Comintern (ECCI), and he represented the British party at the ECCI (1928&#150;1929, 1936&#150;1938). His wife briefly worked at the International Lenin School in Moscow.<br>
<br>As one of the leaders and top intellectual figures of the Communist Party of Great Britain between the wars, Arnot identified strongly with Bolshevik method and discipline and proved a loyal Stalinist. In 1926, from Moscow, he contributed to Comintern criticisms of the British party's leadership in the general strike. Similarly, in 1928 he assisted the Comintern when it decided to purge the British party's leadership and backed Moscow's promotion of the new leadership team of Harry Pollitt and Dutt, inaugurating the &#145;Class against Class&#146; period, a sectarian anti-Labour Party line. He served on the party's executive committee from 1924 to 1938, after which he held no party leadership positions; Harry Pollitt did not want him to be re-elected as he was an inefficient organizer. He also served on the board of the party's <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> intermittently from 1930 and was to contribute over many years. He also worked with the League Against Imperialism and the party's colonial department.<br>
<br>In 1933 Arnot became a founder, and the first principal, of the Marx Memorial Library and Workers' School, a post which he retained until 1947. He was a regular lecturer there, and at special party schools, especially on political topics. In 1934 he wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">William Morris: a Vindication</span>, stressing Morris's role as a revolutionary socialist, and communist antecedent. Morris continued to fascinate Arnot, who was a key founder of the William Morris Society in 1953 and an active member of its committee thereafter. For the Left Book Club he wrote two volumes on the Russian revolution in 1937. A founder of the Communist Party's historians' group between 1938 and 1940, he organized meetings which led to the publication in 1940 of Christopher Hill's essay on the English revolution as a &#145;bourgeois revolution&#146;, a controversial landmark in the interpretation of the 1640s. He was, however, inactive in the historians' group's post-war incarnation until about 1956. He was also a major figure in the formation and activities of the non-party Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960, and was its president at his death.<br>
<br>Arnot's political dedication helped to shape the direction of his writing, much of which was ephemeral and polemical. Over the years he used some aliases, such as Jack Cade, when writing for the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span> in 1915. He also used R. Page, G. Vardy, and G. Scott when working for the Comintern. His writing on the British miners, which began in the 1920s, continued until the 1970s as he worked on his major multi-volume official historical works on the MFGB and the National Union of Mineworkers, as well as histories of the Scottish and south Wales miners. These works were the scholarly culmination of his association with the miners. The first, <span class="italic">The Miners</span>, covering the development of the MFGB from 1889 to 1910, appeared in 1949 and is a solid but fairly traditional presentation of labour history. Six other volumes followed at regular intervals to 1975. The earlier volumes are the more highly regarded, and will be the scholarship for which he is remembered, though Cole regarded his writing as tendentious and inclined to present complex issues in black and white tones  (Wright, 147n). Overall they are powerful and traditional trade-union histories, with an epic style and heroic vision, celebrating solidarity and the achievement of a national union, and culminating in public ownership of the mines.<br>
<br>Arnot died at Farnborough Hospital, Kent, on 18 May 1986 and was cremated at Beckenham crematorium on 28 May. At his funeral on that day the miners' leader Mick McGahey gave the oration.<br>
