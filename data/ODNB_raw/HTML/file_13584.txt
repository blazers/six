<span class="headword">Holme,  Randle</span>  (1570/71&#150;1655), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was born in Chester, son of Thomas Holme (<i>d</i>. 1610), a blacksmith descended from a prosperous gentry family from Tranmere, Cheshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Devenett of Kinnerton, Flintshire. He was the first of four generations, all named Randle, who were members of the Chester Company of Painter-Stainers, Glaziers, Embroiderers, and Stationers and who worked as herald painters and genealogists. Holme was apprenticed to Thomas Chaloner (<i>d</i>. 1590), deputy to William Flower (1498?&#150;1588), Norroy king of arms, in 1587. His first act as a herald came in 1591 when he made additions to Chaloner's 1580 visitation of the city of Chester. He had been admitted to the company by 1593, when he served as steward, and was elected as an alderman of the company in 1598. In the same year Holme married Chaloner's widow, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1635), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alcock; they raised three children, William, <a href="#cosubject_13585">Randle [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Elizabeth, in a house on the Bridge Street corner of Castle Lane, St Mary's on the Hill, Chester.<br>
<br>Holme was elected an alderman by 1604 and was appointed as a servant to Prince Henry by May 1607, when he gained his own arms. More importantly, on 1 March 1600 and again on 20 May 1606 Norroy appointed Holme deputy herald in Cheshire, Lancashire, and north Wales. A change of rules governing deputies in 1618 effectively annulled his office, but in 1619 after persistent lobbying he was reappointed deputy to the College of Arms for Cheshire and north Wales.<br>
<br>Besides his main role of arranging funerals of those entitled to bear arms, Holme made money painting hatchments and marshalling funerals, about which he made detailed notes, completing 121 heraldic and genealogical funeral certificates and collecting the fees payable to the heralds, earning 2<i>s</i>. in the pound for his trouble. However, as his grandson once wrote, &#145;gentlemen &hellip; will order their own concerns&#146;  (Earwaker, 143) and Holme certainly had great difficulty overcoming their reluctance to pay&#151;it took twelve years to collect Sir Thomas Ireland's fee&#151;and this led to frequent discord with his masters in London.<br>
<br>From the early 1620s, when he suffered from a rupture that made long journeys painful, Holme delegated the annual Easter trips to report to the College of Arms to his son Randle. Thus he was fined for not attending Charles I's coronation, and for refusing a knighthood in 1631. Holme was sheriff of Chester in 1615&#150;16 and 1628, alderman in 1629, and in October 1633 he was elected mayor. On 19 July 1634 he was so busy overseeing the Saturday market that he failed to attend the arrival of the earl of Arundel; the earl summoned Holme, berated him furiously, and fined him. On 11 September 1635 Holme married his second wife Catherine Browne (<i>d</i>. 1672), formerly Ellis, daughter of Ralph Allen, alderman of Chester.<br>
<br>Holme remained in the city during the siege of Chester, from September 1645 to February 1646, and the ensuing plague of 1648. Sir William Brereton, who captured the city for parliament, called him a &#145;friend of trust&#146; and, having taken the covenant in 1645, he became a commissioner of the peace and oversaw the repair of the city walls. Despite this, the committee for compounding fined him &pound;160 on the strength of a petition submitted, apparently without Holme's authority, by his nephew Thomas Alcock. Claiming he had &#145;never acted against Parliament&#146;, Holme disputed the fine and produced testimony from Brereton and others, which seems to have led to his being let off.<br>
<br>Holme remained an active member of his company well into old age, serving as an officer, maintaining a busy workshop. His portrait of Sir Roger Mostyn of Mostyn Hall, Flintshire, still at Mostyn, which was signed by Holme and dated 1621, shows him to have been an accomplished portraitist, and helps to explain his attracting of a number of talented apprentices who went on to have successful careers of their own. These included the herald painter and Holme's stepson Jacob Chaloner (taken on in 1601 or 1602); the important regional portrait painter John Souch (in 1607); Holme's sons William and Randle (both in 1617); Edward Bellin (in 1624); and probably (in 1630) the engraver Daniel King (who may possibly have been apprenticed to the younger Randle Holme). Bellin and Souch, and perhaps others, made use of their master's heraldic connections to the gentry of Cheshire, Flintshire, and south Lancashire to find patrons for their own portrait work. In the 1620s Holme served William Stanley, sixth earl of Derby, as keeper of his portrait collection of the barons of the Exchequer.<br>
<br>Holme died on 16 January 1655 at the age of eighty-four and was buried on 30 January 1655 at St Mary's on the Hill, Chester, where he and his family are commemorated by memorials, leaving a house in Eastgate to his wife and the rest of his estate, including the manuscript collection he had inherited from Chaloner and to which he had added voluminously, to his son Randle.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13585"></a><span class="headword">Randle Holme</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1601, <em>d.</em> 1659), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was baptized on 15 July 1601 at St Mary's on the Hill, Chester; he married in the same church on 29 September 1625 Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1640), a granddaughter of his future stepmother and daughter of Mathew Ellis of Overleigh: their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13586/', "Randle Holme (1627&#150;1700)")</script>, followed his father as a herald. Other children who survived infancy were William, Elizabeth, Amy, Alice, and Ralph. He married secondly, in September 1643, Elizabeth Martyn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1671), daughter of Thomas Dodd of Chester. They lived at Elizabeth's house in Watergate Street, Holy Trinity, from 1643 until Randle Holme the elder's death, when they returned to Castle Lane.<br>
<br>Holme worked closely with his father, becoming deputy herald for Lancashire in 1627. He was city treasurer in 1633, clerk to the Stationers' Company in 1641, and mayor for a year from October 1643, working with the royalist governor to defend the city from parliamentarians under Sir William Brereton. Following the city's fall to Brereton, parliament dismissed him from his offices of alderman and JP. Permission for him to compound for his estate was withdrawn in November 1651; there is no record of whether he paid his fine. He worked latterly as a genealogist, admitting he had insufficient learning to compile proper pedigrees. He was buried at St Mary's on the Hill on 1 September 1659.<br>
<br>In their effort to learn the new, polite, and formal styles of figure painting being introduced from continental Europe&#151;and presumably to use them as teaching devices&#151;the elder Randle Holme and his son collected drawings and prints of the sort of polite, formal imagery that was still largely unfamiliar and inaccessible to native English regional painters. Many of these survive today, each marked with the initials of father or son, in the British Library (Harleian MS 2001). John Souch's work in particular shows the influence of both heraldic traditions and the continental prints and drawings that he undoubtedly saw in his master's workshop. In all of these respects Randle Holme the elder spawned a wide and influential circle of painters and herald painters in Chester's three-county cultural hinterland.<br>
