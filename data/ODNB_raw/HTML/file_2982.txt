</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boulter,  Hugh</span>  (1672&#150;1742), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born in London on 4 January 1672, the son of John Boulter of the parish of St Katharine Cree, London. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 11 September 1685, matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in February 1687, but transferred in 1688 to Magdalen College, where he was made fellow in 1696; he graduated BA (1690), MA (1693), and DD (1708). He left Oxford for London in 1700 and was chaplain first to Sir Charles Hedges and then to Archbishop Tenison of Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1708 Boulter was appointed rector of St Olave's, Tooley Street, Southwark, and in 1715&#150;16 was archdeacon of Surrey. In 1719 he served as chaplain to George I in Hanover; he was also appointed bishop of Bristol and dean of Christ Church, Oxford, being consecrated bishop on 15 November 1719. Three days previously, on 12 November 1719, he had married Elizabeth Savage (<i>d</i>. 1754) at the church of St Peter-le-Poer, London; they had no children. In July 1724 Boulter was offered the primacy of the Church of Ireland, which he accepted apparently with great reluctance. Resentment that the archbishop of Dublin, William King, had been passed over for the primacy ensured that a section of Irish opinion was hostile to Boulter from the start. Lord Perceval, whom Boulter met when he went to Richmond to accept the primacy, recorded that Boulter regarded his principal duty in his new post as being to serve the king. Boulter arrived in Dublin on 3 November 1724 in the middle of the &#145;Wood's Halfpence&#146; dispute, the most serious crisis in Anglo-Irish relations during the first half of the eighteenth century. He immediately warned the ministry of the strength of opposition in Ireland to Wood's patent, and in August 1725 he joined with Lord Lieutenant Carteret and Lord Chancellor West in advising the ministry to withdraw it, a recommendation which was reluctantly followed.<br>
<br>From the start Boulter viewed the Irish political situation in terms of an Irish&#150;English conflict and throughout his primacy argued for a systematic policy of strengthening the &#145;English interest&#146; through the appointment of English-born bishops, judges, and privy councillors. Although Boulter's appointment did not, as was once thought, represent a radical change in government policy, his arrival was a turning point in the Irish&#150;English conflict which had been afflicting the Church of Ireland since 1716. With Boulter as primate the leadership of the church was removed from Archbishop King, leader of the Irish interest, and Boulter's influence over the crown's ecclesiastical patronage enabled him to strengthen the English interest thereafter. Relations between King and Boulter began uneasily and deteriorated rapidly. Boulter's status among the Irish clergy was damaged by his scheme to augment the church's fund of first-fruits for the purchase of glebes. This well-intentioned plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Ulster and Munster clergy, and Bishop Nicolson of Derry suspected that Archbishop King had suggested the scheme to Boulter in the sure knowledge that it would arouse such opposition. More serious harm to Boulter's reputation quickly followed, as related by Percival:<blockquote>The ArchBp. of Dublin and our Primate are now at open enmity, never to be reconciled which among many other things is principally occasioned by the Primate's ordaining and giveing a living to one Power, who was one of the Waltham Blacks, the man came hither recommended by my Lord Townsend and Ld. Fane knowing him, gave the account of his being one of those fellows, and if he had not turned informer and evidence against them, he had bin hanged himself, this story the ArchBp. heard, and spoke of it with great bitterness to the Primate, which you may judge did occasion such resentments as are not to be made up. (BL, Add. MS 21122, fols. 27&#150;8)</blockquote>Boulter's declared objective was to break up what he called the &#145;Dublin faction&#146; on the Irish episcopal bench, although this was only finally realized with Archbishop King's death in 1729  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.12). Boulter did, however, quickly assert his authority within the church and the House of Lords. While the English-born bishop of Kilmore, Timothy Godwin, wrote that Boulter made &#145;a very good figure in our House&#146;  (Wake MS 14, fol. 297), a less friendly witness, Philip Perceval, reported that the primate was &#145;looked upon as a dull headed man, who in the house of Lords engrosses all the talk to himself which they say was one reason he was sent over they being tired out with him in England&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 47031, fols. 92&#150;4).<br>
<br>Boulter's strongest asset was the firm backing which he received from the British ministry, which normally enabled him to outmanoeuvre his political opponents, one of whom was Lord Carteret, the lord lieutenant. In order to conciliate leading factions in the Irish House of Commons, Carteret often recommended Irishmen for ecclesiastical and judicial positions on the Irish privy council. Boulter regarded such appointments as likely to weaken the English interest and, because he enjoyed better relations with Robert Walpole and the duke of Newcastle than did Carteret, his views normally prevailed. In 1727 Carteret recommended Theophilus Bolton, the Irish-born bishop of Elphin, for the archbishopric of Cashel, despite Boulter's opinion that Bolton was &#145;as dangerous an Irishman as any on the bench [who] &hellip; would set himself, if he had that station, at the head of the Irish interest here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.134, 115&#150;6). This time Boulter blocked Bolton's appointment to Cashel but had to accept it in 1729, in order, as he put it, &#145;to keep things quiet in this country&#146;  (ibid., 1.272). The deaths in the mid-to late-1720s of William King, Timothy Godwin, and William Nicolson&#151;most of the leading actors who had dominated the Irish&#150;English conflict&#151;facilitated the lessening of national tensions within the church. An indication of this changed atmosphere can be seen in Boulter's recommendation, in 1734, of two Irish-born bishops for promotion, describing both as being &#145;in the English interest&#146;  (ibid., 2.80).<br>
<br>Despite his reputation as a staunch defender of the English interest in Ireland, Boulter devoted considerable attention to the problems of the Irish economy. His particular interest was in currency reform, specifically lowering the value of gold relative to silver in Ireland, a scheme which he first proposed in 1726; he finally overcame the opposition of Irish banking interests and various patriot figures, such as Jonathan Swift, in 1738. Over this issue, as with others, Boulter's pro-English reputation was exploited by his opponents to arouse suspicion about his motives. As he complained in 1729, opponents of his scheme were representing it as &#145;an <i>English</i> project, formed in <i>England</i>, and carried on by my Lord Chancellor, myself, and other <i>English</i> here, with a design to drain this Kingdom of their gold, as they are already drained of their silver&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.245). When a riot bill was rejected by the Irish parliament in 1730, one commentator believed that many had opposed it because it was framed by the primate and the lord chancellor, Thomas Wyndham, and that:<blockquote>[their] warmth about it was one great means of rejecting it, for some people have a mind to show them, that they shall govern but by the people of Ireland, with whom at present they have little correspondence or confidence, nor endeavour to have any, and yet seem desirous to carry everything as they have a mind. (BL, Add. MS 21123)</blockquote>In spite of his reputation Boulter does have a claim to some &#145;patriot&#146; credentials. Following a harvest failure in Ulster in 1728&#150;9, he helped to organize the purchase and transportation of food to prevent famine. He was even prepared to defend the right of Irish protestants to regulate their own affairs without interference from England. In 1735 he asked the duke of Newcastle to oppose a bill in the Westminster parliament &#145;for securing the title of Protestants&#146;. The primate argued:<blockquote>it must be dangerous to give way to passing bills originally in England wholly relating to affairs in Ireland and especially to our private property here, without the least pretence that his Majesty's service or the interest of England are anyways concerned in the affair. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/398, fols. 9&#150;10)</blockquote>Boulter was also actively engaged in a range of philanthropic enterprises. He was vice-president and treasurer of the Incorporated Society in Dublin for Promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland, a scheme designed to promote protestantism, the English language, and industry among poor Catholic children. Boulter established his own school for forty boys at Santry, co. Dublin. The Charter Schools scheme, however, &#145;was soon to fall short of the high hopes with which it had been launched&#146; and the schools subsequently achieved notoriety as centres of neglect and abuse  (Milne, 34).<br>
<br>Boulter had uneasy relations with successive speakers of the House of Commons with whom he and the lord chancellor served as lords justices. He clashed with William Conolly and Sir Ralph Gore over a range of patronage and policy issues, and in 1733, while supporting Henry Boyle's candidature as speaker, asked that Boyle should not be appointed a lord justice. Like his requests to diminish the Irish presence on the privy council, Boulter's plea went unheeded.<br>
<br>Boulter's correspondence gives the impression of an intelligent, diligent, and determined man. There is no question that he understood his role in Ireland as being the loyal servant of the British government, and this perception was bound to bring him into conflict with anyone who put Irish interests above those of the ministry. As a result his reputation in Ireland has suffered among both contemporaries and later generations; he is generally regarded as the personification of the English interest in Ireland in the early Hanoverian era.<br>
<br>Boulter was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Free Thinker</span>, a periodical founded in 1718, and published two sermons; a selection of his correspondence (1724&#150;38) was published in 1769&#150;70 under the supervision of his secretary, Ambrose Philips. Boulter died at St James's Palace, London, on 27 September 1742, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was survived by his wife, who died on 3 March 1754.<br>
