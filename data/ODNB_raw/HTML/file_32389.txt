<span class="headword">Cheetham,  Samuel</span>  (1827&#150;1908), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and ecclesiastical historian</span>, the son of Samuel Cheetham, farmer, of Hambleton, Rutland, and his wife, Emma Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woolston, was born in Hambleton on 3 March 1827. Educated at the neighbouring grammar school of Oakham, he matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1846. He graduated BA in 1850, being a senior optime and eighth in the first class of the classical tripos, and was elected to a fellowship at his college. He proceeded MA in 1853 and DD in 1880. Meanwhile in 1851 he became vice-principal of the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, and, being ordained deacon in 1851 and priest in 1852, was licensed to the curacy of St Mary, Edgehill. In 1853 he returned to Cambridge and served as tutor of Christ's College until 1858. He was curate of Hitchin, Hertfordshire (1858&#150;61), and was vice-principal of the theological college at Chichester (1861&#150;3), at the same time acting as curate of St Bartholomew's. In 1863 he was appointed professor of pastoral theology at King's College, London, where for nineteen years he did excellent work.<br>
<br>Cheetham was co-editor with Sir William Smith of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities</span> (2 vols., 1875&#150;80), doing practically all the editorial work from letter D onwards and writing many of the articles, showing an exceptional combination of laborious erudition and sound judgement. The dictionary remains a much consulted work.<br>
<br>In 1866 Cheetham married Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of Frederick Hawkins MD, and his fellowship consequently lapsed. He added to his professorship the post of chaplain to Dulwich College, which he held until 1884. His work at Dulwich brought him in touch with the south London diocese of Rochester, and led to his appointment by Bishop A. W. Thorold as examining chaplain and honorary canon of Rochester in 1878. In the next year he was made archdeacon of Southwark, and the rest of his life was largely taken up by diocesan activities in south London. He was transferred in 1882 as archdeacon from Southwark to Rochester, and was made a canon residentiary of Rochester in 1883. He remained examining chaplain to the bishop of Rochester until 1897. He was Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge 1896&#150;7, and published his lectures as <span class="italic">The Mysteries, Pagan and Christian</span> (1897). Cheetham, who was elected FSA in 1890, devoted all his leisure to work on church history. He wrote for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and for the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. He completed the sketch of church history which Charles Hardwick, archdeacon of Ely, in 1859 left unfinished at his death. In 1894 Cheetham published <span class="italic">A History of the Christian Church during the First Six Centuries</span>, and in the year before his death <span class="italic">A History of the Christian Church since the Reformation</span>. In 1896 Cheetham married Ada Mary, eldest daughter of S. Barker Booth of Bickley. Cheetham died without issue at The Precinct, Rochester, on 19 July 1908, and was buried in the cathedral. His second wife survived him.<br>
