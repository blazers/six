<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richards, Sir  George Henry</span>  (1820&#150;1896), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, was born in Antony, Cornwall, on 13 January 1820, the eldest of three sons and second of four children of Captain George Spencer Richards RN, and his wife, Emma Jane, daughter of Samuel Harvey. Richards entered the Royal Navy in 1832 and in 1835 was appointed midshipman in the survey ship <i>Sulphur</i>, serving in the Pacific under Captain Edward Belcher. Belcher was notoriously difficult to please, and, of the surveyors who piloted the fleet to Canton (Guangzhou) during the First Opium War (1839&#150;42), Richards was one of the few to receive his praise. In 1842, as lieutenant, Richards served in the surveying brig <i>Philomel</i> off the Falkland Islands and the coast of South America. He commanded the <i>Philomel</i>'s small-arms men at the storming of the forts in the Parana River, Argentina, in 1845, and was promoted commander. On 24 July 1847, in Hampshire, he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of Captain Richard Spackman Young RE. They had four daughters and four sons, the eldest, George, becoming a rear-admiral. From 1847 to 1851 Richards served under Captain John Lort Stokes surveying the coasts of New Zealand in arduous conditions, sometimes from open boats. In 1852 he served again under Belcher, this time on a voyage to the Arctic in search of the Franklin expedition. No sign of Franklin was found, despite a number of prodigious sledge journeys, including one by Richards which lasted for ninety-three days. Belcher proved more overbearing and unreasonable than ever on this mission and Richards's tact and judgement were critical in holding the operation together. He was promoted captain in 1854. Between 1856 and 1863 he carried out surveys of Vancouver Island and parts of British Columbia.<br>
<br>In 1863 Richards was appointed hydrographer to the Royal Navy, and began work in January 1864. Among his innovations was to make charts readily available for general use on Royal Navy ships, so that all officers, not only those responsible for navigation, would become familiar with them. He also organized the compilation and publication of charts showing prevailing winds and currents for each quarter of the year and improved the training of pilots. Under Richards hydrographic activity concentrated on areas of strategic importance, such as Canada when the USA was expanding into Alaska, or the newly opened Suez Canal in 1870, and areas of economic expansion such as Japan and Chile in the 1860s. Following the successful laying of an Atlantic submarine cable from the <i>Great Eastern</i> in 1866, British ships began laying cables in other parts of the world. Naval surveying ships undertook preliminary work, taking soundings along the proposed routes and sampling the seabed: these activities coincided with a surge of interest in the scientific exploration of the sea. Richards worked with the Royal Society, of which he was elected a fellow in 1866, to arrange for scientists to accompany hydrographic cruises from the Faro Channel to the Strait of Gibraltar, and for the <i>Challenger</i>, with scientists chosen by the Royal Society on board, to set out in 1872 on a scientific voyage of three years. In 1868 Richards privately circulated his <span class="italic">Memoir</span> of the hydrographic office, which is an important source for the history of the department. During his period of command the workload of the service increased substantially, in part because of increasing scientific demands and in part because of the transfer to it of Indian hydrographic work.<br>
<br>Richards was promoted rear-admiral in 1870, and became CB in 1871. He retired as hydrographer in 1874, and became managing director of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, which laid 76,000 miles of submarine cables during his period there. He was knighted in 1877, and in the same year became a vice-admiral on the retired list. In 1882 he married, as his second wife, Alice Mary, daughter of the Revd Robert Tabor of Cheam School; she survived him, but they had no children. Richards died in Bath on 14 November 1896.<br>
