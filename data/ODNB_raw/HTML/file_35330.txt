<span class="headword">Gore,  William George Arthur  Ormsby-</span>, fourth Baron Harlech  (1885&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician and banker</span>, was born in Eaton Square, London, on 11 April 1885, the only child of George Ralph Charles Ormsby-Gore (1855&#150;1938) who became in 1904 the third Baron Harlech, and his wife, Lady Margaret Ethel Gordon (<i>d</i>. 1950), daughter of the tenth marquess of Huntly. He was educated at Eton College, and New College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in modern history in 1907.<br>
<br>Ormsby-Gore was elected in January 1910, by a majority of eight, Unionist MP for Denbigh, moving in 1918 to Stafford, a seat he retained until he succeeded to the peerage on his father's death in 1938. He married on 12 April 1913 Lady Beatrice Edith Mildred Gascoyne-Cecil (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of the fourth marquess of Salisbury. They had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Commissioned in the Shropshire yeomanry in 1908, Ormsby-Gore joined up when war broke out in 1914 and was on active service in Egypt when in 1916 he joined the Arab bureau as an intelligence officer attached to the high commissioner, Sir A. Henry McMahon. He was recalled in March 1917 at the instance of Lord Milner to be his parliamentary private secretary and also, a little later, an assistant secretary to the cabinet assisting Sir Mark Sykes. Impressed by Zionism while in Egypt, he established cordial relations with its leader in London, Chaim Weizmann, who took refuge in his office while the cabinet approved, on 31 October 1917, the Balfour declaration, and with whose support he was appointed British liaison officer with the Zionist mission sent to the Holy Land in March 1918. He returned to London in August and was a member of the British delegation to the Paris peace conference in 1919. He attended the meetings of the permanent mandates commission, of which he was the first British member, in October 1921 and August 1922. In the winter of 1921&#150;2 he accompanied the under-secretary for the colonies, E. F. L. Wood, on a mission to the West Indies.<br>
<br>An unusually appropriate apprenticeship thus preceded Ormsby-Gore's appointment, in October 1922, as parliamentary under-secretary at the Colonial Office. He remained there until 1929 except for the brief interval of the first Labour government in 1924, during which he was appointed by its colonial secretary, J. H. Thomas, as chairman of an all-party commission which visited east and central Africa in the autumn, advised against any immediate federation of these territories, and recommended a loan of &pound;10 million, guaranteed by the Treasury, mainly for the improvement of transport, anticipating much of the thinking behind the <span class="roman">Colonial Development Act</span> of 1929. In 1926 he visited west Africa and in 1928 Ceylon, Malaya, and Java. He was made a privy councillor in February 1927 and was in charge of the Colonial Office from July of that year until the following January during the empire tour of the colonial secretary, Leopold Amery.<br>
<br>Ormsby-Gore's knowledgeable enthusiasm for the arts, well exemplified in his book <span class="italic">Florentine Sculptors of the Fifteenth Century</span> (1930), resulted in a long and active association with the work of the major British galleries and museums. He was a trustee of the National Gallery from 1927 to 1934 and again from 1936 to 1941, of the Tate Gallery from 1934 to 1937 and again from 1945 to 1953, a life trustee of the British Museum from 1937, president of the National Museum of Wales from 1937, and was chairman of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries in 1949. He inherited a fine family library and although obliged to reduce its size when he ceased to live at Brogyntyn in Shropshire in 1955, he later added many rare books. He was president of the National Library of Wales from 1950 to 1958.<br>
<br>In the National Government of 1931 Ormsby-Gore was postmaster-general without a cabinet seat, and in November of that year he became first commissioner of works with a seat in the cabinet, an office he retained until his appointment as colonial secretary in May 1936. Under his auspices a determined effort was made to improve the architectural standards of new post offices and labour exchanges. He also wrote four volumes in the series <span class="roman">Guide to the Ancient Monuments of England</span> (1935, two in 1936, and 1948).<br>
<br>During the two years he was colonial secretary, Ormsby-Gore had little opportunity for the constructive work for which he was so well equipped by temperament and experience. (Perhaps no other colonial secretary had as much first-hand knowledge of the colonial empire.) In the month in which he took office, the Arabs demanded that Jewish immigration into Palestine and purchase of land there should be ended and attacked Jewish lives and property. A royal commission, headed by Lord Peel, reported in July 1937 that the mandate was unworkable and recommended partition and the creation of a much truncated but independent Jewish state. The government, on Ormsby-Gore's recommendation, accepted these proposals. He did not, however, succeed in persuading parliament to endorse them but only to agree that the scheme might be put before the League of Nations while making clear that parliament was not committed even to the principle of partition, much less the commission's actual proposals. As the international situation worsened, the British government became increasingly concerned to appease the hostility of the Arab states to any continuing Jewish immigration. Ormsby-Gore considered himself committed to partition. He was also an outspoken critic of Nazi Germany so that it was hardly surprising that when on his succession to the peerage in May 1938 he felt constrained to offer his resignation, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, should have accepted it.<br>
<br>As fourth Baron Harlech he served as commissioner for civil defence in the north-east region from 1939 to 1940 but his keen and active disposition chafed at the restraints still imposed by Whitehall. In 1941 he became British high commissioner in South Africa. He greatly admired the intellectual range of its prime minister, J. C. Smuts, but found little else to admire in the politics and society of that country. The long association between Smuts and Churchill and many other leading British personalities sharply limited the intermediary role of the high commissioner, although his informative reports were appreciated by C. R. Attlee, then secretary of state for the dominions.<br>
<br>After Harlech's return to London in 1944 he became a director of the Midland Bank, of which he was chairman from 1952 to 1957. It incorporated the London Joint Stock Bank which his great-grandfather had helped to establish in 1836. He was also chairman of the Bank of British West Africa from 1951 to 1961. Under his auspices, staff conditions and training were improved and substantial expansion of commercial business in Africa promoted.<br>
<br>Appointed GCMG in 1938, Harlech was created KG in 1948. He was constable of Harlech Castle from 1938, of Caernarfon Castle from 1946 to 1963, and lord lieutenant of Merioneth from 1938 to 1957. He received three honorary degrees, and was made an honorary fellow of his former college, New College, Oxford, in 1936. He devoted much time to the University of Wales, of which he was pro-chancellor from 1945 to 1957.<br>
<br>A convinced Conservative, Harlech was prominent in the tory revolt that ended the coalition in 1922 and remained a firm supporter of Baldwin in the party divisions on Indian reform. He opposed the Hoare&#150;Laval plan to accommodate Italian aggression in Ethiopia (thereby earning from Neville Chamberlain, with Walter E. Elliot and Oliver F. G. Stanley, the contemptuous sobriquet of the Boys' Brigade) and was bitterly hostile to Nazi Germany. Unusually receptive of ideas, he was always outspoken and sometimes impetuous. At the Colonial Office in the twenties he sought to promote scientific research and its application to the medical and agricultural problems of tropical dependencies and took a leading part in the attempt to develop educational policies more consonant with African environments, but constructive development was largely frustrated by financial constraints. His hope in 1918 that Zionist objectives might be attained without political domination soon appeared visionary but his acceptance of partition, if inopportune in the international situation in 1938, was a courageous assessment of realities in Palestine. Perhaps his deepest interests were in the arts, especially architecture, of which his knowledge was extensive.<br>
<br>Harlech died in Bayswater, London, on 14 February 1964. His wife survived him. A lady of the bedchamber from 1941, she was created DCVO in 1947 and was made an extra lady of the bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, in 1953. Their eldest son was killed in a motor accident in 1935 and the title passed to their elder surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31518/', "Sir (William) David Ormsby Gore")</script>.<br>
