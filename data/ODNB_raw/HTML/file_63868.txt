<span class="headword">Bull <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hicks]</span>,  Amy Maud</span>  (1877&#150;1953), <span class="occ">suffragist</span>, was born at Great Holland Hall, Essex, on 16 July 1877, the daughter of a farmer, Charles Thompson Hicks (1838&#150;1892), and his wife, Lilian Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1853&#150;1924). The family included another daughter, Beatrice, and a son, Charles, who died in the First World War. Amy Hicks was educated privately and at North London Collegiate School, before going up to Girton College, Cambridge, in 1895 to read classics. She graduated in 1899 with a first-class degree, having been awarded the college's Agnata Butler prize in 1897 and 1898 and the Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Montefiore memorial prize in 1899. She was a visiting lecturer at Westfield College in 1900&#150;01, class mistress at Belvedere High School, Liverpool, from 1901 to 1904, and a fellow of Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania in 1904&#150;5.<br>
<br>Amy Hicks's mother, brought up by a father who &#145;was a great believer in woman's capability, and trained both his daughters to manage their own affairs and depend on their own judgment just as carefully and thoroughly as he trained his sons&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Vote</span>, 2 April 1910), had worked for many years with the Charity Organization Society and as a school manager, both in East Anglia and then in north St Pancras, and for the suffrage cause from the early 1880s. By 1902 both mother and daughter were members of the Central Society for Women's Suffrage. In December 1906 they joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) on the occasion of the banquet given by the constitutional suffrage society at the Savoy to celebrate the release from prison of the first militant suffragettes, but left that organization in October 1907 to join the newly founded Women's Freedom League (WFL). Amy Hicks had become the WFL's literary secretary by 1909. In July of that year she was imprisoned for three weeks on a charge of obstruction. In 1910 she both gave support to the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage and rejoined the WSPU. In 1910 Amy Hicks was a member of the committee of the Tax Resistance League and in November of that year was arrested, with her mother, during the struggles with the police in Parliament Square on &#145;black Friday&#146;. In March 1912 she was imprisoned for four months after taking part in the WSPU's window-smashing campaign in the West End of London. She spent time both in Holloway and Aylesbury, for a period in solitary confinement, went on hunger strike, and was forcibly fed. She was considered by the Home Office to be one of the ringleaders of the hunger strike at Aylesbury. On 27 May 1913 Amy Hicks was, with Sylvia Pankhurst, a founder of the East London Federation of the WSPU. With her mother she later became a member of the United Suffragists. During the First World War Amy Hicks joined the Women's Volunteer Reserve (Green Corps), which had been founded by Evelina Haverfield, a fellow suffragette.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1927 at St Peter's Church, Belsize Park, Amy Hicks married a widower, John Major Bull (1858/9&#150;1944), who had been a clerical officer in the War Office, and was the son of Archibald Bull, accountant. There were no children of the marriage. Amy Bull served as a rural district councillor in Chelmsford from 1927 to 1930, and lectured to Women's Institutes on the production and preservation of home-grown food. She was made an MBE some time before 1948. She died of pneumonia at her home, General's Orchard, Little Baddow, near Chelmsford, on 11 February 1953. In her will she left &pound;1000 each to Girton College and to the National Trust.<br>
