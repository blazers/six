<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coleridge,  (David) Hartley</span>  (1796&#150;1849), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 19 September 1796 in Oxford Street, Kingsdown, Bristol, the eldest of the three surviving children of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, Sara (1770&#150;1845), daughter of Stephen Fricker of Bristol. He was a remarkably precocious child, but Coleridge actively encouraged his inherent strangeness and powerful imagination. He watched and questioned him, trying to find in the behaviour of his child confirmation of his own theories of language and the imagination. Such overwhelming attention alternating with the bleakness of his father's frequent departures began to damage Hartley's ability to function in the real world and caused him increasingly to retreat into the security of his imaginary world, Ejuxria, a world which he could control. He knew the boundary between the two worlds was there but he constantly strove to dissolve it.<br>
<br>After four unsettled years in Somerset and London the family moved to Greta Hall, Keswick, Cumberland, in July 1800. The house was shared with the landlord William Jackson and his housekeeper, Mrs Wilson, who became figures of stability in Hartley's young life, as did Robert Southey who came to visit and stayed for forty years. After attending Keswick day school, in 1808 Hartley went with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5879/', "Derwent Coleridge (1800&#150;1883)")</script> to school at Ambleside, and weekends were spent with the Wordsworth family. The school was run by the Revd John Dawes, under whose enlightened guidance Hartley progressed well; in May 1815 he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. In 1818 he was awarded a second-class degree and the following year became a junior fellow at Oriel College. In the early nineteenth century Oriel was characterized by austerity, sobriety, and adherence to regulations, and it quickly became apparent that Hartley Coleridge could not fit into it. He was expelled on charges of &#145;sottishness, a love of low company and general inattention to college rules&#146;  (Griggs, 306). It was eventually conceded that the reports of drunkenness were exaggerated. He did suffer from a degree of alcoholism for much of his life, but it was only just beginning at this point. It seems probable that lack of respect for college traditions and attitude was the real cause for the expulsion. He had quietly ignored those regulations he found petty or hypocritical, knowing that this would not be overlooked by the college authorities but unable to compromise.<br>
<br>Hartley Coleridge moved to London in 1820 and tried to establish himself as a writer. His first essays were published in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> at this time. But, having no money and no home, he had to rely on the charity of his parents' friends and in the autumn of 1822 had to submit to his father's insistence that he should return to Ambleside to work for the Revd Dawes. Initially all went well, but after Dawes's retirement Hartley Coleridge and a Mr Suard tried to expand the school and in 1826 it folded. This left him without a regular income but gave him time to return to writing. Over the next few years he was to publish mainly in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Winter's Wreath</span>, but also in <span class="italic">The Gem</span>, the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span>, the <span class="italic">Christian Mother's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Academic Correspondent</span>, and then later in his life in the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Englishwomen's Magazine</span>. His essays and letters reveal a persona, the Old Bachelor, behind which he could hide his feelings of guilt and failure and his sense of having been abandoned by his family. He came to view himself as a man of adverse destiny, out of step with nature and with time. His despair was hidden under the mask of whimsical drollery and chivalrous, gentle eccentricity. From 1822 until his death his essays changed very little in style, tone, or concerns. They mirror the quaint, digressive, learned Old Bachelor but they also throw out glimpses of the man behind the mask, illuminating his erudition about literature, art, and theology and revealing his social concern, especially his hatred of injustice and oppression. One volume of his poetry was published in 1833 and was well received. It was reissued as part of the two-volume collection published posthumously in 1851 with an introductory memoir by Derwent Coleridge. The poems are a curious mixture, sometimes narrated by the persona of the Old Bachelor, sometimes in specific genres, and sometimes very personal sonnets of extreme pathos which reveal the anguish he tried to suppress. Of the latter the most poignant are &#145;Long Time a Child&#146; and &#145;Let me not Deem&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1832 Hartley Coleridge moved to Leeds to the home of the publisher Bingley, to whom he was contracted to write short biographies for a series, <span class="italic">Lives of Distinguished Northerns</span>. The thirteen <span class="italic">Lives</span> he completed before Bingley went bankrupt in 1833 transcend the confines of word length and lack of source material, giving not only a sense of the subject but the added delight of Hartley Coleridge's intimate style. He returned to the Lake District, remaining in Grasmere until February 1837 when his friend Isaac Green, assistant master at Sedbergh School in Yorkshire, became ill and he offered to take his place. He stayed for two terms and was happy and successful. The following year he repeated his success, this time standing in for the headmaster. During his first stay at Sedbergh his landlady in Grasmere, Mrs Fleming, died, and on his return he lived with William and Eleanor Richardson. He returned to them after his second spell at Sedbergh, and when they moved to a larger house, Nab Cottage, on the road between Grasmere and Rydal, he moved with them and remained there until his death.<br>
<br>Hartley Coleridge did not marry or have children. His morbidly low sense of self-worth conspired with his need for the safety of self-containment to make sexual relationships almost impossible. But as the Old Bachelor he was loved and cared for by many people in the area. His papers are full of invitations to attend family gatherings. In his turn he tried to give help and consolation to all who needed it, regardless of their social status. And many friends understood the underlying desolation which led to occasional bouts of self-abandon and wandering. In 1839 the publisher Moxon asked him to write an introduction for a new edition of the plays of Massinger and Ford. Again he suffered from limitations of length and materials but eventually produced a useful and approachable piece of work, published in 1840, and with further editions appearing in 1848 and 1851. The work was well paid and he was also earning a small amount of money at this time from lecturing on poetry at the museum of the Natural History Society at Kendal. In early December 1848 he dined out, and walked home in the pouring rain. Afterwards he became ill, developed bronchitis, and became worse throughout December. By Boxing day the Richardsons were sufficiently concerned to send for his brother Derwent. Hartley Coleridge died on 6 January 1849 at Nab Cottage and was buried on 11 January in Grasmere churchyard.<br>
