<span class="headword">Pearson,  John</span>  (1613&#150;1686), <span class="occ">bishop of Chester</span>, was born on 28 February 1613 at Great Snoring, Norfolk, and baptized there on 14 March. He was the eldest of the nine children of Robert Pearson (<i>d</i>. 1640) and his wife, Joanna, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28139/', "Richard Vaughan")</script>, bishop of London. Robert Pearson, who came from Westmorland to Queens' College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1587, became a fellow and MA in 1592 and DD in 1609. From 1607 to his death in 1640 he was rector of North Creake, near Walsingham, Norfolk, and from 1610 rector of Great Snoring nearby. Collated archdeacon of Suffolk in 1613, he appears from his <span class="italic">Articles to be Enquired of in the Ordinary Visitation</span> (1639) to have been a firm enforcer of Bishop Richard Montagu's church discipline. In 1626 John Davenant&#151;bishop of Salisbury and formerly a fellow of Queens' with Pearson&#151;gave to Pearson the prebend of Netherhaven, which he eventually resigned in 1639.<h2>
<a name="Studentandchaplain"></a>Student and chaplain</h2>John Pearson was a king's scholar at Eton College from 1623 to 1631. He was certainly a hard-working student: one story tells of his re-lighting his candle once the rest of the dormitory was asleep and, through these midnight studies, reading &#145;most of the Greek and Latin Fathers of the Church&#146; before leaving school. Initially admitted to Cambridge at Queens' College on 10 June 1631, Pearson entered King's College as a scholar the following April, matriculating the same year. He contributed two Latin poems to <span class="italic">Anthologia Cantabrigiensis in exanthemate regia</span> (1632) on Charles I's recovery from smallpox and one to <span class="italic">Justa Edovardo King</span> (1638). Like other poems about Edward King, Pearson's fourteen lines&#151;on the sea's protecting Britain and yet drowning this ornament to Cambridge&#151;are overshadowed by Milton's &#145;Lycidas&#146; at the volume's end. He contributed another poem to <span class="italic">Voces votivae</span> (1640) on the birth of Prince Henry. Pearson became a fellow of King's in 1635, graduating BA in 1636 and MA in 1639. Pearson's father's successor to the Salisbury prebend having died within a few weeks, Davenant chose Pearson to replace him on 30 December 1639, which obliged him to resign his fellowship on 2 August 1640. In June that year he became chaplain to Lord Keeper Finch; but Finch, implicated in Charles I's unpopular policies, was impeached in October and in December fled to The Hague.<br>
<br>Through these and the succeeding troubled times, Pearson was helped by a small inheritance from his father and much more substantially by the patronage of Sir Edward Coke's family. On 27 October 1640 Coke's son Henry presented Pearson to the rectory of Thorington, Suffolk; Pearson retained his predecessor's curate, John Freeman, and continued to spend at least some of his time at King's. Towards the middle of 1643 he preached a university sermon, &#145;The excellency of forms of prayer&#146;, a scathing attack on the extemporarians and on the impending Westminster assembly, to which, proclaims the last sentence, &#145;whosoever will not freely submit his judgement &hellip; deserves no better, than&#151;to be counted a member of the catholic church!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minor Theological Works</span>, 2.111). Like others embarking on the Church of England's defence, Pearson had to answer both sectaries' attacks on its traditions and Romanists' attacks on its authority: in <span class="italic">Christ's Birth Not Mistimed</span> (1649) he defended the celebration of the nativity, and in a preface to Lord Falkland's <span class="italic">Discourse of Infallibility</span> (1651 edn) he noted Hugh Cressy's uneasiness in adopting that doctrine.<br>
<br>In 1645 Pearson was in the west of England as chaplain to Goring's army, of which little remained after the battle of Langport on 10 July. He was obliged to give up the rectory of Thorington some time before 31 March 1646, at which time Henry Coke presented it to John Chunne. Henry's elder brother Robert reportedly made Pearson his chaplain, and Evelyn's diary for 1 August 1650 seems to corroborate this: &#145;after dinner at <i>Durdens</i> [Robert Coke's house at Epsom], meeting my former acquaintance <i>Mr. Pierson</i>, I had good Conversation&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.15). Subsequently Pearson is said to have been chaplain to Robert's brother-in-law George, Lord Berkeley, whose funeral sermon he preached in 1658, and to his son of the same name (who inherited Durdans in 1653). On 1 May 1658 Pearson delivered in London another funeral sermon, on his contemporary and fellow Cantabrigian the royalist poet John Cleveland. This sermon, which unfortunately does not survive, &#145;made his death glorious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clievelandi vindiciae</span>, 1677, sig. A7<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="Londonpreacher"></a>London preacher</h2>On 17 April 1652 Evelyn heard Pearson preach in Eastcheap&#151;presumably at St Clement, where he heard him again on 9 March 1653. At that time, or certainly by August 1654, Pearson was one of the parishioners' voluntary lecturers, delivering the weekly sermons that led to the great book by which he is chiefly known, <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Creed</span> (1659). Written, as he explains, for both unlearned and learned readers, &#145;the body of it containeth fully what can be delivered and made intelligible in the English tongue&#146;, and in the margin<blockquote>is contained whatsoever is necessary for the illustration of any part of the Creed, as to them which have any knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Oriental languages, of the writings of the ancient Fathers, the doctrines of the Jews, and the history of the Church. (J. Pearson, &#145;To the reader&#146;, <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Creed</span>, 1659)</blockquote>In the mid-1650s Pearson made extensive manuscript notes on the works of Aeschylus, which Thomas Stanley appropriated verbatim and without acknowledgement in his edition of 1663. The &#145;liveliness of perception and the keen interest in literary history&#146; shown by Pearson's more general comments &#145;are no less noticeable &hellip; than his enormous learning&#146;  (Fraenkel, 1.80). His prolegomena to the Neoplatonist Hierocles's <span class="italic">De providentia</span> (1655) and his manuscript notes on the lexicographer Hesychius are also significant contributions to classical studies, and typical in their different ways of Pearson's scholarly interests.<br>
<br>In November 1652 Evelyn &#145;went to <i>Lond</i>: where was proposd to me the promoting of that greate Work (since accomplishd by <i>Dr. Walton</i> (<i>Bishop</i> of Chester) <span class="italic">Biblia polyglotta</span>), by <i>Mr. Pierson</i> that most learned divine&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.78). Pearson is not mentioned by Brian Walton among his collaborators; he helped, however, to assemble the commentaries and tracts of the substantial collection <span class="italic">Critici sacri</span> (1660), to which he also wrote the preface. In 1659 he wrote brief prefaces to David Stokes's <span class="italic">Explication of the Minor Prophets</span> and to the <span class="italic">Golden Remains</span> of &#145;the ever memorable&#146; John Hales, a fellow of Eton in Pearson's schooldays. He was active once more in polemics: in 1657 he and Peter Gunning engaged &#145;two Disputants of the Roman Profession&#146;, and in 1660 he published two anti-presbyterian tracts against reformation of the public doctrine of the Church of England.<h2>
<a name="Restorationchurchman"></a>Restoration churchman</h2>In 1660 Pearson petitioned Charles II for a mandamus to take his DD, from which he had been prevented because he &#145;could not submit to the late irregularities&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 164); the degree was conferred the following year. Successive preferments now came to him: archdeacon of Surrey (presented by Charles II, 19 July 1660); rector of St Christopher-le-Stocks, Threadneedle Street, London (collated 17 August 1660); canon of Ely (collated fifth prebend 28 August 1660, first prebend 9 October 1661); master of Jesus College, Cambridge (admitted 4 December 1660). He owed the canonry and mastership to the patronage of Matthew Wren, bishop of Ely, whose funeral sermon he preached in 1667.<br>
<br>Pearson was a Lent preacher at court in 1661, and when the Savoy conference opened on 15 April he was one of the assistant commissioners on the episcopal side. He participated very actively and the bishops chose him, with Peter Gunning and Anthony Sparrow, to put their case in the formal disputation at the end. Their chief opponent, Richard Baxter, recalled<blockquote>Dr. <i>Pierson</i> was their true Logician and Disputant, without whom, as far as I could discern, we should have had nothing from them, but Dr. <i>Gunning</i>'s passionate Invectives mixd with some Argumentations: He disputed accurately, soberly and calmly (being but once in any passion) breeding in us a great respect for him, and a perswasion that if he had been independent, he would have been for Peace, and that if all were in his power, it would have gone well: He was the strength and honour of that Cause which we doubted whether he heartily maintained. (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, ed. M. Sylvester, 1696, 2.364)</blockquote>The doubt about Pearson's commitment sounds like wishful thinking.<br>
<br>When convocation met (initially in May 1661) Pearson among other duties took an active part in preparing a Latin version of the prayer book and, early in 1664, a standard Latin and Greek school grammar, an educational scheme that was not pursued. He and Gunning were &#145;the prime advisers&#146; of the amplifications in the ordination formulae for priests and bishops  (H. Prideaux, <span class="italic">Validity of the Orders of the Church of England</span>, 1688, 43). In June 1661, on the king's recommendation, Pearson succeeded Gunning as Lady Margaret's professor of divinity at Cambridge. He began his tenure with a series of scholastic lectures &#145;On the being and attributes of God&#146;; the other lectures that survive, from the end of his professorship, are on the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>. Related to these, as part of a larger projected work, are six &#145;Theological determinations&#146; of specific questions. Pearson also left some learned Latin sermons from these Cambridge years and some more topical commencement orations. None of this Cambridge material was printed in his lifetime; in the 1660s the only substantial scholarly work he published was his preface to the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, 1665, defending the old translators against the censure of St Jerome.<h2>
<a name="MasterofTrinityCollegeCambridge"></a>Master of Trinity College, Cambridge</h2>On 14 April 1662 Pearson was translated by the king to the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge, in place of Henry Ferne, promoted bishop of Chester. Writers on Pearson state that he never married and discount an octogenarian fellow's recollection of the master's wife at Trinity  (Churton, 1.lxv, cxvi); however, a warrant for his presentation to the mastership was issued &#145;with dispensation for him to hold the said place, he being in a state of marriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 173). So there is reason for uncertainty. Now, if not earlier, he resigned his Salisbury prebend and London benefice, to which his successors were chosen on 9 and 22 August 1662. At Trinity, Pearson proved an obliging and conscientious master, whose college business included the composition of eulogies later published in <span class="italic">Letters and Poems in Honour of the Incomparable Princess, Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle</span> (1676). He lived modestly and donated &pound;250 (reckoned to be half his annual salary) to the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral; he also loaned the exchequer &pound;100 &#145;for his Majesty's service for the maintenance of the present war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar Treasury Books</span>, 1667&#150;8, 161&#150;2). On 14 March 1667 he was elected to the Royal Society, proposed by Matthew Wren, Clarendon's secretary and son of the Matthew Wren, bishop of Ely. Although a barely active member, he was on the council in 1675 and he paid his subscription regularly through the 1670s.<br>
<br>In 1672 Pearson published his second great work, <span class="italic">Vindiciae epistolarum S. Ignatii</span>, written in Latin and directed primarily against the French protestant Jean Daill&eacute;. The point at issue was episcopacy, which after the Restoration became increasingly central to the Church of England's apologetics. Scripture uses the words <i>episcopos</i> and <i>presbyteros</i> interchangeably, but Ignatius makes bishops pre-eminent. As an apostolic father&#151;the only one to express this view&#151;protestants had to take account of Ignatius. The authenticity of his letters had been vigorously debated: some, and parts of others, looked to be spurious but there seemed no way to be certain. In 1645 James Ussher found the way with two manuscripts in which the text predated the medieval interpolations. This should have settled the matter, but anti-episcopalians could not give up, because the episcopal passages were still there in the genuine letters. French protestants, harassed by Louis XIV, felt especially vulnerable. Daill&eacute;, who had a considerable reputation as a learned and moderate writer, advanced sixty-six objections to Ignatius's authorship and dated the forgery about the year 300. Pearson demolishes first the external, then the internal, arguments of Daill&eacute; and other anti-episcopalians. His use of linguistic evidence is especially impressive, and his ability to come up with three or four refutations of an argument anticipates the treatment of Phalaris's letters by Richard Bentley, who memorably wrote of Pearson &#145;the very dust of his writings is gold&#146;  (R. Bentley, <span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. A. Dyce, 3 vols., 1836&#150;8, 2.29). Pearson anticipates Bentley also in his sense of literary history and the character of particular ages. (On one important point he corrected Ussher, who was misled by the testimony of St Jerome into thinking there were six, not seven, genuine letters.)<h2>
<a name="BishopofChester"></a>Bishop of Chester</h2>According to a newsletter of January 1671 it was believed that Pearson would have one of the bishoprics then vacant; but his elevation did not occur until the end of the following year, when he was chosen for the see of Chester. As this was one of the poorer bishoprics, he was granted, like his predecessors, a dispensation to hold the rectory of Wigan, Lancashire, <i>in commendam</i>, and also to retain his archdeaconry of Surrey. Pearson was consecrated at Lambeth on 9 February 1673. For his first diocesan visitation he had printed <span class="italic">Articles of Inquiry</span> (1674); he held a second visitation in 1677. In 1675 he issued injunctions to the cathedral clergy, dealing among other things with the performance of the choir and the cathedral school. Initially he was lenient to nonconformists but later accepted the magistrates' increasing severity. On 25 September 1683 Secretary Jenkins complained about his administration: the Thanksgiving for Charles's preservation from the Rye House plot was not performed in the archdeaconry of Richmond. Jenkins would have recalled the pro-Monmouth riots the previous September when the mob ransacked Chester Cathedral.<br>
<br>In the 1670s Pearson was often in London to attend parliament and also to preach his Lent sermon at court. In his first parliamentary session the Lords considered the Commons' bill for the toleration of dissenters, and other difficult questions of religion were to follow. On 31 October 1674 Secretary Williamson wrote to Pearson as one of the bishops &#145;particularly pitched upon&#146; to meet and advise the king on &#145;the preservation and security of the Protestant religion&#146;. Pearson was unwell, confined to his chamber by gout, but eventually left for London on 25 November. The bishops' advice, signed by Pearson and five others late in January 1675, called for firmer measures against Catholics  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1673&#150;5</i>, 390, 403, 416, 437, 549&#150;50). On 28 February 1675 Pearson ordained &#145;about 30 <i>Deacons</i> &amp; <i>Priests</i>&#146; at St Paul's, Covent Garden  (Evelyn, 4.54). He described himself as &#145;infirme&#146; in his will, dated 2 January 1678, but he was present at the opening of parliament on 15 January  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/384/116). He continued to be in London when parliament met and he attended the Lords fairly regularly, up to the dissolution in January 1681. He was at the third Exclusion Parliament, 21&#150;8 March 1681, every day. But the following year he could no more make long journeys.<h2>
<a name="Pastorandscholar"></a>Pastor and scholar</h2>The notion that Pearson was a negligent valetudinary derives from Burnet's aspersion:<blockquote>He was not active in his diocese, but too much remiss and easy in his episcopal function; and was a much better divine than a bishop. He was a speaking instance of what a great man could fall to: for his memory went from him so entirely, that he became a child some years before he died. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.134)</blockquote>The image of senility is conveyed by Henry Dodwell's anecdote: the bishop, led into his library by an old nurse, &#145;held out his hands, and cried out, &#147;O sad, whose books are all these?&#148;&#146;  (E. Bridges, <span class="italic">Restituta</span>, 1, 1814, 53) This condition was shorter-lasting than Burnet's &#145;some years&#146; implies: Pearson's detailed <span class="italic">Annales Cyprianici</span> introduced John Fell's 1682 edition of Cyprian, and in 1683 he was still composing his posthumously published dissertations on the succession of Roman bishops. He held an ordination service on 21 December 1684; he dictated the codicil to his will, although unable to sign it, on 18 June 1685; he performed his last institution in person on 3 September 1685; he appointed John Allen, his chaplain, archdeacon of Chester on 12 April 1686, and John Thane prebendary a week later. He died at Chester on 16 July 1686. In his will Pearson bequeathed his Norfolk property at Great Snoring and at &#145;Brownham&#146; (Downham) to his brother Theophilus. He left money to other relatives and to the poor of Great Snoring and of St Oswald's parish, Chester. He had already helped his nephews, appointing Henry Dove archdeacon of Richmond, on 3 December 1678, and John Thane, who inherited most of his books and papers, Chester prebendary.<br>
<br>In Chester Cathedral Pearson's burial place, modestly unmarked and forgotten near the high altar, was discovered in 1841, and his body was moved to the north transept, where a very large tomb, designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield, was raised over it in 1863. Pearson's true glory was not a matter of marble and wrought iron: he belonged, in Pepys's phrase, among &#145;the great Cavalier parsons during the late troubles&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.337); his friend Evelyn reckoned him &#145;the most learned Divine of our Nation&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.5&#150;6), and Burnet acknowledged him &#145;in all respects the greatest divine of the age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.134). His <span class="italic">Exposition of the Creed</span>&#151;clear, accurate, sensitive, and extraordinarily detailed&#151;remains a standard work, unlikely to be surpassed. His <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span> effectively settled the authenticity of Ignatius's letters; indeed, when William Cureton argued in 1845 that the shorter, newly discovered Syriac version was the authentic core, one response was Edward Churton's new edition of the <span class="italic">Vindiciae</span> (1852). Moreover, as Fraenkel writes:<blockquote>Pearson, though primarily known as a theologian, was perhaps England's greatest classical scholar before Bentley (his only possible rival being Thomas Gataker); in range of learning and critical power he is probably inferior to no English scholar save Bentley. (Fraenkel, 1.40)</blockquote>
