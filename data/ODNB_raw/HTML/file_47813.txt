<span class="headword">Menzies, Sir  William John</span>  (1834&#150;1905), <span class="occ">lawyer and financier</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 14 October 1834. His father, Allan Menzies (1804&#150;1856), was a writer to the signet and professor of conveyancing (1847&#150;56) in the university. His mother, Helen Cowan, was the daughter of Alexander Cowan, paper maker. Menzies was educated at Edinburgh Academy, the University of Edinburgh, and in Germany. He trained as a lawyer, was admitted writer to the signet in 1858, and subsequently established his own practice. In 1859 he married Helen Marshall, a widow, the daughter of Alexander Adie, an optician. Three years after her death in 1867 he married Ellen, the youngest daughter of William Young and the widow of William Tweedie. In 1878 his second wife, Ellen, died and in 1879 he married a third widow, Annie Percival, the eldest daughter of J. A. Drought of Whigsborough, King's county, Ireland, whose late husband had been T. S. Jones of the National Bank of India.<br>
<br>In 1864, 1867, and 1872 Menzies travelled to the United States on behalf of clients. Greatly impressed by the economic potential and higher rates of return on capital there he formed the idea of founding a foreign investment company. Existing investment trusts were fixed trusts or legal trusts which terminated at a defined date and held a portfolio of securities that normally were not changed. Menzies instead proposed an investment company which would manage a flexible portfolio. The Scottish American Investment Company Ltd, formed on 29 March 1873, was the first investment company established in Scotland and the first to invest exclusively in the United States.<br>
<br>Menzies devised a capital structure which showed a shrewd understanding of the savings market. Investors could participate in either or both the equity and the loan capital. The nominal capital was &pound;1 million, but to start with only 50,000 shares of &pound;10 each were for sale, and only &pound;2 of each &pound;10 was to be paid up. For the loan capital, the company proposed to issue debenture stock bearing interest at 5.5 per cent and secured on the amount of unpaid capital and on the investments themselves. Investors who wished to participate in the risk or equity capital thus had access to a large quantity of low-priced loan capital. By issuing 50,000 shares of &pound;10 each&#151;a total capital of &pound;500,000&#151;but collecting only &pound;100,000 (50,000 shares at &pound;2) the company could borrow up to &pound;400,000 in debentures at 5.5 per cent. This could then be invested in the United States where interest rates were 7 per cent and above. The income to pay the ordinary shareholders would come from the difference between home and overseas interest rates. Substantial capitalists who had sufficient cash to take a risk with only the security of the underlying investment could buy the ordinary shares, while people who wanted a safe and steady return, yet a higher yield than was available in Britain, could purchase debentures with double security. In just over a month the equity shares were fully subscribed. Debentures were also popular, and by March 1874 the company had reached the limits of its borrowing powers.<br>
<br>Scottish American proved extremely successful. The ordinary dividend from 1874 to 1903, when Menzies retired, never fell below 10 per cent. Investments rose from &pound;436,000 to &pound;3.4 million in 1903. This record contrasted with the single-purpose ventures that Menzies and his coterie operated in mining, ranching, and forestry, where fraud, legal complications over foreign ownership of American land, managerial weakness arising from absentee ownership, and speculation without regard for the underlying value of assets lost money for investors.<br>
<br>Scottish American usually avoided single-purpose ventures, but in 1883 part of the reserve funds were invested in town sites in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Site values fell and Menzies was severely criticized by shareholders who demanded that he should drop his promotional activities and concentrate on Scottish American's business. When another of his ventures, the California Redwood Company, failed two years later the press blamed the directors of Scottish American. Public enthusiasm for overseas investment nevertheless remained high and by 1890 Menzies had achieved international recognition as an expert on American investment. In 1895 he published <span class="italic">America as a Field for Investment</span>.<br>
<br>Menzies served both God and Mammon. He was active in the Church of Scotland as an elder, as representative of the presbytery of Skye at the general assembly, and as agent for the church (1868&#150;1905). He was prominent in the campaign against the disestablishment and disendowment of the Church of Scotland in the 1885 general election. He jointly wrote the petition <span class="italic">Appeal to the People of Scotland</span>, which was circulated among the electors of W. E. Gladstone's Midlothian constituency and delivered to Gladstone, who was staying with Lord Rosebery at Dalmeny. In May 1903, at Holyrood, Menzies was knighted for his services to the church.<br>
<br>Ill health forced Menzies to retire as managing director of Scottish American in 1903. He died on 14 October 1905 at his home in Canaan Lane, Morningside, Edinburgh, leaving his widow, Annie, who died in 1923, and a family of six sons and two daughters.<br>
