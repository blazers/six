<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mantovani,  Annunzio Paolo</span>  (1905&#150;1980), <span class="occ">orchestra leader and musical arranger</span>, was born on 15 November 1905 in Venice, Italy, the son of (Bismark) Benedetto Mantovani and his wife, Iparia Gandino (<i>d</i>. 1969). His father, born in Rovigo, was a violinist and leader of the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, and had played under Arturo Toscanini, Hans Richter, Thomas Beecham, Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and Pietro Mascagni. He was also professor at two Italian conservatories (and held the title cavaliere).<br>
<br>In 1909, when Mantovani was four, his father went to London as leader of the orchestra of the Italian Opera Company at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. At the end of one season he decided to stay in England with his family: wife, son, Annunzio, and daughter, Remila (<i>b</i>. 1907). A second daughter was born in England. The young Mantovani went to Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School and L'&Eacute;cole Notre Dame, London. His father, who wanted him to be an engineer, gave him piano lessons and at an early age he showed great musical aptitude. At fourteen he developed a passion for the violin and his father, now won over, promised that the boy should have his Testori violin, which had been presented to him by a Russian princess, if he could play the Kreutzer violin concerto before he was sixteen. This was accomplished nine months before his birthday. His father now agreed that he should go to the Trinity College of Music, where he studied violin and composition. He became a professional violinist and gave recitals at the Wigmore Hall and played the Saint-Sa&euml;ns concerto at the Queen's Hall. He played in various hotel restaurant orchestras, including the Midland Hotel in Birmingham in 1923, and by 1927 he was leading a small orchestra at the fashionable Metropole Hotel, London, which had in its ranks such future talents as Reginald Kilbey and George Melachrino, as well as Mantovani's father on violin. He first recorded about 1927 under the name of Leonelli Gandino on the Imperial label, and made many records between 1927 and 1932 with various dance orchestras; he first recorded under his own name on the Regal label from 1928. By 1930 he was leading his Tipica Orchestra, resident at the Monseigneur Restaurant in Piccadilly from 1931 to 1934, where he began to build his national reputation through a series of lunchtime broadcasts. From 1932 to 1935 he recorded for the Homophone group of labels under various names and, with his Tipica Orchestra (title dropped in 1937), for Columbia, in 1935&#150;40. Later he was resident at the Caf&eacute; de Paris, the Mario, and the Hollywood restaurants, and worked at Butlin's holiday camps. He became an experienced theatre conductor, for a time musical director for No&euml;l Coward&#151;with <span class="italic">Sigh No More</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Pacific 1860</span> (1946), <span class="italic">Ace of Clubs</span> (1950), and Noel Gay's <span class="italic">Bob's your Uncle</span> (1948), among the shows he directed, the last being J. B. Fagan's <span class="italic">And So to Bed</span> (1951), a musical romp based on the life of Samuel Pepys.<br>
<br>In July 1935 Mantovani became a naturalized British subject, having married Winifred Kathleen Moss (1909&#150;1977), the daughter of a City company director, William James Moss, on 4 August 1934. For most of their marriage they had a house in Bournemouth and kept a flat in St John's Wood, with Winifred his constant support and encouragement during a long and happy marriage. They had a son, Kenneth Paul, and a daughter, Paula Irene.<br>
<br>Monty, as Mantovani was always known, might well have continued as just one of many accomplished and admired orchestra leaders had he not attained great popular fame through his phenomenal success as a recording artist. The fruition of his musical ideas came in a neatly coincidental way with the recording boom prompted by the launching of the hi-fi long-playing record. In the late 1940s the lightly lush Mantovani style had a steady following in the USA as well as in Britain and it was decided to make a fresh appeal to the record market by launching a comparatively large light orchestra of about forty-five players with some thirty-two strings, proportions far beyond the scope of the general palm court sort of ensemble. The talented composer/arranger Ronald Binge (1910&#150;1979), who had played with and arranged for Mantovani since 1935, conceived the idea of a delayed entry device in the string writing which gave a shimmering, cascading effect; it was first successfully employed in the 1951 recording of &#145;Charmaine&#146;, which quickly sold a million copies. The novelty caught on in a big way and the LPs issued by the Decca Record Company, for whom he had started recording in 1940, began to sell in very large numbers. By 1971 his LPs had sold some 35 million copies. Now very popular in the USA, he made the first of many American tours in 1955, also regularly visiting Europe, South Africa, Canada, and the Far East until 1969.<br>
<br>The huge record sales continued into the 1970s, his first twenty-five years with Decca being celebrated in 1965 when Mantovani was presented with a diamond studded baton. By then he had also been rewarded with eighteen gold discs, each celebrating million-selling recordings. He made his last LP in 1975, the year in which ill health forced his retirement. Beyond his skills as a conceptual director and arranger of most of his scores, and the fame that came with the cascading strings, he was also an accomplished composer of orchestral pieces, his works including &#145;Royal Blue Waltz&#146;, &#145;Toyshop Ballet&#146; (which won a Novello award in 1957), &#145;Serenata d'amore&#146;&#151;which became his best-known creation&#151;and the song &#145;Cara mia&#146; which was made a no. 1 hit by the singer David Whitfield.<br>
<br>Mantovani was a strict disciplinarian at work, a trait that was always made acceptable by his innate courtesy and charm. He was appreciated by his players as a thorough technician and a musician of experience and quality. He maintained a quietly dignified manner in his soft-voiced introductions and allowed the music to speak for its flamboyant self; but his quiet and unassuming manner changed when the baton was in his hand. He liked to think that his head was British and his heart Italian&#151;an ancestry that came out in his music-making. He always enjoyed his role as the maestro and would be found seated elegantly at his grand piano, pen in hand, when one visited him at his large flat off Regent's Park. He passed his retirement years in Dorset, and died in the Clarence Nursing Home, 3/4 Clarence Road, Tunbridge Wells, on 30 March 1980. He was cremated at Tunbridge Wells on 8 April and his ashes were interred in Bournemouth, next to his wife's.<br>
