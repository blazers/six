<span class="headword">Thom,  Robert, of Ascog</span>  (1774&#150;1847), <span class="occ">civil engineer and industrialist</span>, was born in the parish of Tarbolton, Ayrshire, in January 1774, the elder son of John Thom, tenant farmer. His mother's identity remains elusive because her name was not recorded in Thom's baptismal entry in the Tarbolton parish register for 26 January 1774. An agricultural community that specialized in dairy farming, late eighteenth-century Tarbolton became celebrated for its clubbable culture of enquiry and debate, and included two masonic lodges. Robert Thom was educated locally, almost certainly at the parish school, and was subsequently trained by an older brother as a wright and joiner. These craft skills proved to be useful assets for employment in Scotland's rapidly developing textile industry.<br>
<br>During the early 1790s Thom settled in Glasgow and was eventually appointed manager of John Monteith's cotton mills at Pollokshaws, then a textile village outside the city boundary. He also took time to attend evening classes at Anderson's Institution, founded in 1796 as a pioneer of technical and scientific education. Thom's abilities were recognized by Robert Lothian, professor of mathematics and geography, who bequeathed his papers to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; before leaving Scotland to live in the United States. Thom himself did not remain in Glasgow; some time after 1800 he became manager of the Blackburn cotton mill, near Bathgate, West Lothian. There he formed a close working partnership with William Kelly, who had managed the New Lanark mills during the 1790s. Thom and Kelly had much in common, as both were mechanically inventive; indeed, Kelly's skills had been prominently on display at New Lanark with his showpiece, five-dialled clock, which was intended to represent the precise regulation of the working day.<br>
<br>Thom also met his future wife in West Lothian. Catherine Prentice (1796&#150;1869) was the daughter of David Prentice, a tenant farmer in the parish of Livingston, and his wife, Elizabeth. The couple married on 31 October 1814 in Canongate, Midlothian, where Thom was living. They subsequently had three daughters and three sons, four of whom survived into adulthood. Around 1817 the family settled permanently in Bute, an island in the Firth of Clyde where since 1779 the Rothesay Spinning Company had been operating one of Scotland's first cotton mills. Bute was thought to be particularly suitable for cotton spinning because of its abundant water supplies and proximity by sea to the transatlantic port of Greenock in Renfrewshire. Thom arrived in Rothesay to become resident manager of the company, which had been acquired by the Kelly&#150;Thom partnership in 1813.<br>
<br>The Rothesay mill had not been cost-effective for its previous owners, and Thom identified inadequacies in the main energy supply as the key problem. From 1800 steam engines had augmented the original water power in a bid to boost production, but coal had proved prohibitively expensive to import to the island. In West Lothian Thom had already given thought to developing a purely hydraulic scheme for the Blackburn mill, a project that was ultimately not implemented but nevertheless influenced his ideas for improving the Rothesay mill's output. After intricately surveying the island, Thom used Loch Fad, the largest water catchment area, as his main reservoir. He then channelled water into the loch from other sources through an extensive system of aqueducts. These followed the natural contours of the landscape, thus doubling the amount of water available in Loch Fad without necessitating the expense of constructing bridges or tunnels. The flow of water was regulated by a system of self-activating sluices, designed to ensure an even supply during wet and dry seasons.<br>
<br>The success of the Loch Fad scheme established Thom's reputation as a hydraulic civil engineer and he was recommended to Sir Michael Shaw Stewart of Blackhall, fifth baronet, a prominent Renfrewshire landowner, as the most likely person to resolve Greenock's water deficiencies. In 1824 Thom responded positively to Stewart's request to prepare a plan for the town, selling his ambitious idea of creating an artificial reservoir in the hills above Greenock on the basis of economic efficiency and commercial opportunity. Thom was evangelical about the environmental advantages of water: &#145;Here you would have no steam-engines, vomiting forth smoke, but, on the contrary, the pure &#147;stream of the mountains&#148;, flowing past in ceaseless profusion, carrying along with it freshness, health and vigour&#146;  (Thom, 48). The irony of this statement, which was probably quite deliberate, was that James Watt, the pioneer of steam power, had been Greenock-born.<br>
<br>In 1825 a joint-stock enterprise, the Shaws Water Company, was set up to develop Thom's Greenock scheme and two years later the first phase was completed at a cost of &pound;90,000. The water supply centred on a &#145;great reservoir&#146;, which after Thom's death in 1847 was renamed Loch Thom in tribute to his memory. The main aqueduct, popularly known as the Greenock Cut, stretched over 4 miles and ended at a dam where the water descended into the town. To ensure that the supply was drinkable Thom devised an innovative system of self-cleansing sand filters. His gravitational scheme was immediately projected as one of the technical wonders of the west of Scotland, and attracted the attention of industrialists and civic activists intrigued by Thom's claims to achieve low-cost yet effective results. In later years he oversaw smaller-scale schemes in Ayr and Paisley and acted as a consultant on water supplies for several towns across the British Isles. He gave evidence to the health of towns commission in June 1843, when he explained his methods of purifying water and of engineering aqueducts and pipes so that towns received a supply at high pressure. Critical of private water companies, which he alleged put vested interests before the public good, he urged the assistance of government and legislation to ensure that the community was not denied &#145;the first necessity of life&#151;a copious supply of pure water&#146;  (<span class="italic">First report of the commission for inquiring into the state of large towns and populous districts</span>, C 572, 1844, 2.22).<br>
<br>Thom was evidently committed to hard work and relatively little is known about his life beyond his professional interests. In addition to his civil engineering career he continued to play a managerial role in the Rothesay cotton mill. After William Kelly's retirement in 1826 he entered into partnership with Thomas Struthers, and the factory commissioners subsequently described their workforce as &#145;very happy and healthy looking&#146;  (&#145;First report &hellip; employment of children in factories&#146;, 1833, 1.119). In 1831 Thom purchased the estate of Ascog in western Bute and lived there for the rest of his life. He died at Ascog House on 14 December 1847 and was buried in the graveyard of Rothesay parish church. Highly regarded by civil engineers for his technical ingenuity, Thom stood out in an era that was characterized by the ubiquitous power of steam because he highlighted the potential of water as a &#145;green&#146; yet viable energy source.<br>
