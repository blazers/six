<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Devoto,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1708&#150;1752), <span class="occ">painter and scene designer</span>, was referred to as being French during his lifetime, but his parents were probably Italian and the name has Genoese connections. It is circumstantially probable that he was related to the John Devoto who made properties for the court masque <span class="italic">Callisto</span> (1675), and possibly also to Antonio Devoto, an Italian puppet showman, who performed at a booth in Charing Cross between 1662 and 1675.<br>
<br>In 1708 Devoto worked as an assistant to the Flemish painter Gerard Lanscroon (<i>d</i>. 1737), painting the &#145;great room&#146; at Burley on the Hill in Rutland for Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham. Devoto seems to have established himself as a decorative painter by 1718, and drawings of 1719 show similarities to the work of James Thornhill (1675&#150;1734). There are clear links between the techniques and subject matter of the decorative and architectural painter and the scenic artist: &#145;ingenious foreshortening, play of perspective, and painting of false architecture and sculpture &hellip; the same classical themes did duty both for ceilings and walls, and for the arguments of <i>opera seria</i> and heroic drama&#146;  (Croft-Murray, 7). Early scenic commissions of 1719&#150;20 suggest that Devoto may have additionally established his reputation by producing work in the style of, or indeed copies of, the Italian designers: the Bibiena family, Filippo Juvarra (1676&#150;1736), and Pietro Righini (1683&#150;1743). His first recorded theatre work was to produce designs for <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> at the Drury Lane theatre, &#145;With an entire Sett of Scenes representing Ancient Rome, painted by Mons. Devoto&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 24 Sept 1723). The following year, for John Thurmond's <span class="italic">Harlequin Sheppard</span> at Drury Lane, the playbill (28 November 1724) records, &#145;A New Night Scene. The Scenes being all painted from the real Place of Action&#146;. His work must have been sufficiently well recognized by audiences for Hogarth to include the reference, in his <span class="italic">A Just View of the British Stage</span> (1725), to &#145;Scene Newgate, by M D&#150;V&#150;to&#146;.<br>
<br>Devoto prepared scenes for Thurmond's <span class="italic">The Miser, or, Wagner and Abericock&#151;a Grotesque Entertainment</span> (30 December 1726); for <span class="italic">Perseus and Andromeda</span> (15 November 1728); for <span class="italic">Othello</span> (15 November 1731) at Drury Lane, whose playbill offered &#145;a new set of Scenes being a prospect of the Ponte Rialto at Venice painted by Mr Devoto&#146;; and for Theophilus Cibber's <span class="italic">The Harlot's Progress, or, The Ridotto al' Fresco: a Grotesque Pantomime Entertainment</span> (31 March 1733). There is, however, insufficient recorded work to indicate that Devoto was a resident painter at Drury Lane. Henry Angelo, in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1823), indicates that he may have worked for John Rich at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre after 1732, although Rich moved into his newly built Covent Garden theatre in 1732 and the playbills make no mention of Devoto.<br>
<br>At Henry Giffard's new theatre in Ayliffe Street, Goodman's Fields, Devoto designed scenes for Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Mistake</span> and &#145;a New Dramatick Entertainment, call'd Jupiter and Io &hellip; in which will be Introduc'd, a new Pantomime Interlude, call'd Mother Shipton's Wish; or Harlequin's Origin&#146; (24 January 1735). Referring to Dryden's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Post and General Advertiser</span> said:<blockquote>We hear the Designs of Merlin's Cave, that were presented last week to Her Majesty by Mr Giffard, have been so well approv'd of, by many Persons of Quality, that Mr Devoto, who made the Draughts, has had several Copies bespoke by the Nobility. (<span class="italic">Daily Post and General Advertiser</span>, 27 Jan 1736)</blockquote>In a theatre world where scenes were taken from stock and their precise relationship with the play may only have been circumstantial, artists would frequently provide generic scenes, or rework earlier scenes, for new theatrical circumstances. In this way Devoto, for example, provided scenes for the White Swan Theatre in Norwich, where it was reported &#145;the fine Sett of Scenes painted by the famous French Painter Devoto are arriv'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Gazette</span>, 20&#150;27 Jan 1739). But there is also evidence to suggest that Devoto was providing for the growing taste for topographical scenes that could be recognized by their audiences. For the New Wells Theatre, London Spa, Clerkenwell, in June 1740 he was responsible for scenes for <span class="italic">A Hint to the Theatres, or, Merlin in Labour</span>. This included a view of Merlin's Cave, one of Queen Caroline's features in the royal gardens at Richmond. Given the reference to the queen's satisfaction with this topic, it is likely that this was either a reworking of the scene from <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> or simply the original set of scenes hired from Ayliffe Street.<br>
<br>Spectacle and pantomime provided an opportunity for theatres such as Ayliffe Street and the New Wells to evade the 1737 <span class="roman">Stage Licensing Act</span>, which permitted only Drury Lane and Covent Garden to present &#145;legitimate&#146; drama. At Goodman's Fields, Devoto prepared the scenes and their associated machinery for <span class="italic">Harlequin Student, or, The Fall of Pantomime</span> (3 March 1741). These included a magician's cave which broke open to reveal Pierrot, views of Covent Garden, the Tower of London, the Hermitage in Richmond (another of the queen's garden follies), and a court of Cupid which disappeared while a stage descended representing a heathen heaven. As Harlequin is banished with Mercury's song<blockquote>
<div>Sink Sink, Dishonour of the Age<br>
</div>
<div>Disgrace and Scandal of the Stage<br>
</div>
<div>Ye Worthless Crew, away,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>the stage direction reads, &#145;The Scene draws, and discovers the Monument of Shakespear, exactly represented, as lately erected in Westminster Abbey.&#146; The following year the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> (3 July 1742) advertised &#145;A Grand Representation of Water Works, as in the Doge's Gardens at Venice&#146; with scenes by Devoto at the New Wells Theatre.<br>
<br>In 1744 David Garrick, whose London d&eacute;but had taken place at Ayliffe Street in 1741, engaged Devoto to provide &#145;one Flat Scene and 4 Wings&#146; for the private theatricals of John Russell, fourth duke of Bedford, at Woburn, for which the painter received &pound;10 10<i>s</i>. On 29 January 1746 a benefit was planned for Devoto at the New Wells Theatre in Lemon Street, Goodman's Fields. The occasion was additionally intended to mark the d&eacute;but of his daughter in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, but the play was changed and there are no further references to his daughter's acting career.<br>
<br>The few references to Devoto's career after this date make no mention of continued scenic work. However, for the Covent Garden Lenten oratorio season in 1752 he designed theatrically inspired admission tickets for performances of Handel's <span class="italic">Samson</span> and <span class="italic">The Choice of Hercules</span>. Also in 1752 he provided a satirical frontispiece for an edition of <span class="italic">Twelve English Songs, Serious and Humorous</span> by Barnabas Gunn.<br>
<br>There are no later references to the life or work of the artist and there is no evidence of a will being made, or of the date of Devoto's death. However, a John Devoto, possibly his son, living in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, established a drawing school at 139 Longacre in 1775 and exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1776.<br>
<br>John Devoto was painted by the Venetian Vincenzo Damini some time before 1730 (when Damini left the country), and a mezzotint, after Damini, was made by John Faber the younger and published in 1738, inscribed, <span class="italic">Johannes Devoto: historicus scenicusque pictor</span>. Ninety-one designs, which represent Devoto's principal theatrical and decorative work, are to be found in the print room of the British Museum.<br>
