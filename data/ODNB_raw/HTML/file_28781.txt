<span class="headword">Warren,  John Taylor</span>  (1770&#150;1849), <span class="occ">military surgeon</span>, born on 10 November 1770, was the son of Thomas Warren of Dunstable, Bedfordshire. He entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, in 1780, and afterwards studied medicine at St George's Hospital, where he became a favourite pupil of John Hunter (1728&#150;1793). In 1792 Warren was appointed assistant surgeon in the 20th dragoons, a regiment raised for service in Jamaica. After serving there for some time he was ordered to St Domingo. In June 1795 he was appointed surgeon to Colonel Keppel's regiment of foot but before joining, owing to the mortality among European officers, he was nominated surgeon to the 23rd infantry or Royal Welch Fusiliers; he was promoted to the post of staff surgeon to the forces in November 1795. In 1797 he returned to England with the wounded and, having distinguished himself by his work, he was stationed at the recruiting depot in Chatham barracks. He subsequently moved to Gosport, and finally to the Isle of Wight, where he became a friend of Sir George Hewett, the commander of the forces stationed there. In 1800 Warren married Jane-Amelia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55276/', "Chevalier Bartholomew Ruspini")</script>; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Warren was appointed deputy inspector of military hospitals in 1805 and was placed in charge of the home department. In 1808 he proceeded to Spain with a detachment of British troops, and, after being present at Vimiera, he accompanied Sir John Moore on his expedition, despite suffering from acute rheumatism which made it necessary for him to be assisted in mounting and dismounting his horse. When the troops embarked at Corunna he was placed in charge of the wounded, and he was the last British officer to leave the shore. In 1816 he was appointed inspector-general of hospitals, succeeding James Borland in the Mediterranean station. He retired from the regular service in 1820.<br>
<br>For many years Warren acted as vice-president of the Army Medical Benevolent Society for Orphans, and as trustee of the Society for the Widows of Medical Officers. In 1843, in recognition of his services, a silver vase was presented to him by his fellow officers and friends. He died on 6 October 1849 at his house in Marine Parade, Brighton, and he was buried in the family vault at South Warnborough, Hampshire, where his brother, Thomas Alston Warren, was rector. His wife and daughter survived him.<br>
