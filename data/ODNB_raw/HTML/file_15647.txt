<span class="headword">Kirby,  William</span>  (1759&#150;1850), <span class="occ">entomologist and naturalist</span>, was born at Witnesham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, on 18 September 1759, the son of William Kirby (<i>d</i>. 1791), a solicitor, and his wife, Lucy Meadows. He had four sisters.<br>
<br>Kirby's initial interest in natural history was fostered by his mother, who had a conchological collection from which she taught him the names of shells. In 1770 mother and son made a small herbarium at Witnesham. His mother died in 1776 and Kirby was subsequently educated at Ipswich grammar school and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1781 and was ordained deacon in June 1782. He was later appointed rector of Barham, Suffolk, and assistant curate of Coddenham and was given the permanent living of Barham in 1796. He returned to natural history studies after receiving his appointment, although these appear not to have interfered with his pastoral duties.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1797 Kirby went on a natural history excursion to Ely, Northampton, Huntingdon, and Cambridge with the naturalist Thomas Marsham (<i>d</i>. 1819). His natural history interest at this time seems to have been largely botanical and he had a particular interest in cryptogamic plants. He is known to have had a copy of James Edward Smith's <span class="italic">English Botany</span>. He served as secretary to the local militia during the invasion scare of 1803&#150;5, his job being to look after the women and children. By 1805 Kirby was acquainted with William Spence (1783&#150;1860) of Hull, and by 1809 he knew William Hooker. The three are known to have had natural history rambles together.<br>
<br>Kirby wrote on mycological and zoological topics but turned his attention to entomology in the 1790s with the finding of a &#145;very beautiful golden bug&#146; on his window sill. He communicated his natural history findings to the Linnean Society of London, on whose first list of fellows (1798) his name appears. He wrote his first paper in 1793, but his first major entomological work, on the bees collected in his parish&#151;<span class="italic">Monographia apium Angliae</span>&#151;appeared in 1802 and was illustrated with colour plates. In this he described some 200 types, many of which are still recognized as species. Kirby is said to have learned the techniques of engraving in order better to understand natural history illustration. In 1808 Spence suggested a collaboration to produce a basic work on entomology. This was begun in 1809 and resulted in their pioneering illustrated volumes <span class="italic">Introduction to Entomology</span> (1815&#150;26); editions appeared throughout the early nineteenth century, the last being the sixth (1843).<br>
<br>Kirby's first wife, Sarah Ripper, died in 1814. The following year he took his MA. He married again in early 1817, and in the June went with his second wife, Charlotte Rodwell (<i>d</i>. 1844), for a short trip to Paris. Kirby took an active part in the Zoological Club of the Linnean Society which provided the key management for the new Zoological Society in 1826. His work was both economically and taxonomically orientated, and in addition to bees he wrote on insect spoilage of wheat, timber, and, in 1808, on <i>Apion</i>, or weevils. Among his better-known entomological works is his paper on the insect parasites of bees, the Strepsiptera, an entirely new order described by him in 1815. In his &#145;Century of insects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span>, 12, 1818, 375&#150;453) he described new species from specimens in English natural history cabinets. He was elected FRS in 1818 and shortly afterwards described some of the insects brought back from Australia by Robert Brown on the <i>Investigator</i> expedition of 1801&#150;5. The theme of overseas entomology was taken up again when he wrote on the insects brought back from the Canadian Arctic by John Richardson from the expedition of 1825&#150;7. This was his entomological contribution to the illustrated <span class="italic">Fauna boreali Americana</span> (1837). He became honorary president of the Entomological Society of London in 1837 and gave his insect collection to that society. (It was later, in 1863, given to the British Museum and much of it survives in the Natural History Museum, London.) The <span class="italic">History of the Collections</span> (vol. 2) noted that Kirby's specimens from his &#145;Century of insects&#146;, Robert Brown's Australian material, Richardson's Canadian insects, and some of Kirby's beetles and his bees from the <span class="italic">Monographia apium Angliae</span> were extant in 1906.<br>
<br>Kirby lived in the closing years of pre-Darwinian natural history. It was a time when the foundations of entomology were being laid and he corresponded widely with naturalists at home and abroad, including Sir Joseph Banks, Alexander Macleay (1767&#150;1848), J. C. Dale (1792&#150;1872), Edward Sabine, the Oxford-based naturalist the Revd F. W. Hope, N. A. Vigors, J. C. Fabricius (1745&#150;1808) of Kiel, Adam Afzelius (1750&#150;1837) in Sweden, Ludwig Imhoff (1801&#150;1868) in Switzerland, and the French entomologist P. A. Latreille (1762&#150;1833), among many others. Kirby's correspondents are of interest because their names appear in some of his insect names.<br>
<br>In later years Kirby seems to have lived the life of a quiet country parson and his portraits show him as a well-built man of medium height with blue eyes. He seems to have been a believer in the non-Calvinistic Anglican tradition. His meditations in 1829 on the temptations and passion of Our Lord were based on those of the early seventeenth-century Bishop Andrews. In the autumn of 1830 he was approached by J. G. Children of the British Museum, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the bishop of London acting for the trustees of the eighth duke of Bridgewater through the Royal Society to begin work on a contribution to what became known as the <span class="roman">Bridgewater Treatise</span>. In 1835 he contributed <span class="italic">On the History, Habits and Instincts of Animals</span>.<br>
<br>Kirby died at Barham on 4 July 1850. He appears to have been a much-loved pastor to his country congregation and was buried in the chancel of his parish church. The Revd William Kirby is not to be confused with the later entomologist, William F. Kirby (1844&#150;1912) of Leicester.<br>
