<span class="headword">Thorne,  James</span>  (1795&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Methodist Bible Christian preacher</span>, was born on 21 September 1795 at North Furze Farm, Shebbear, Devon, the third child of John Thorne (1762&#150;1842), farmer, and his wife, Mary (1760&#150;1843), daughter of Samuel and Mary Ley of Rightadown Farm in the neighbouring parish of Bradford. Educated at Langtree School, Thorne was a serious-minded child of evangelical disposition; confirmed in 1812, he even entertained thoughts of becoming an Anglican clergyman. However, on 17 August 1815 he heard the Methodist preacher William O'Bryan (1778&#150;1868) preach at Cookbury, and was sufficiently impressed to invite him to come to Lake Farm (to which the Thornes had moved). In the kitchen of the farm, on 9 October, the first Bible Christian society was formed; among its first members were John and Mary Thorne and their five children.<br>
<br>James Thorne quickly became immersed in the Bible Christian movement. He preached his first sermon on Christmas day 1815, and became a local preacher on 1 January and a full-time itinerant minister on 15 March 1816. He evangelized Devon and Cornwall for four years, mostly on foot, suffering privation and opposition, frequently preaching five times every Sunday and twelve times each week, and securing conversions at nearly every service. On 21 February 1820 he set out to evangelize Kent, spending much of the next six years there or in London. His exertions at this period are described in his diary for 1816&#150;27, extracts from which appeared in his son's memoir. It was in London that he married, on 15 September 1823, Catherine Reed (1797&#150;1874), the third daughter of William and Catherine Reed of Holwell Farm, Buckland Brewer, Devon, and herself a Bible Christian itinerant. They had six children between 1824 and 1838, three of whom predeceased Thorne.<br>
<br>As secretary of conference, Thorne worked alongside O'Bryan in devising the connexional polity, preparing the hymnbook, establishing the book room, and founding chapels. After O'Bryan's separation from the Bible Christians in 1829, it was largely due to Thorne's leadership skills that the whole movement did not collapse, spiritually and financially, an achievement which, from his base around Shebbear, left him in virtually undisputed authority over the connexion for the next forty years. Throughout this period he constantly held high office, including the presidency of conference on five occasions, and was particularly active in publishing, chapel building, and educational and foreign missionary work. Until 1844 he also travelled extensively in southern England, visiting the societies. In 1870 failing health caused him to retire to Plymouth, where he died on 28 January 1872, after a fortnight's illness and within hours of conducting his last service. He was buried in the graveyard of Ebenezer Chapel, Shebbear.<br>
<br>It was rightly said by Frederick William Bourne (1830&#150;1905), the connexion's third leader, of Thorne's contribution to the Bible Christians that &#145;he either originated nearly every forward movement or his executive ability was speedily requisitioned to carry it to a successful issue&#146;  (Bourne, <span class="italic">Bible Christians</span>, 31). When he became a preacher in 1816 the connexion had 237 members and no chapels; on his death it had 18,438 and 560 respectively. However, Thorne's efforts were not confined to one denomination, nor his skills to the pulpit or office. He was a noted platform orator, denouncing slavery, tithes, and religious discrimination; supporting temperance, Sunday schools, Methodist union, the Anti-State Church Association, the Evangelical Alliance, and the Bible Society; and campaigning for the Liberals. Such vitality owed much to his physical strength (he was a large-limbed man of above average height), cheerful disposition, and personal habits verging on the puritanical.<br>
