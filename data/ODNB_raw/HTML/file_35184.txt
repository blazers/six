<span class="headword">Narbeth,  John Harper</span>  (1863&#150;1944), <span class="occ">naval architect</span>, was born at Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 26 May 1863, the son of John Harper Narbeth and his wife, Anne Griffiths. He was the fourth child in a family of eight children. His father, after serving at Pembroke dockyard as a shipwright apprentice and writer, became a timber merchant.<br>
<br>Narbeth's interest in the sea began at an early age, and his pastimes of boating and yachting led him to study the behaviour and designs of ships and small craft. He was indentured as shipwright apprentice at the dockyard in 1877, and in 1882, after a competitive examination, took a course of higher training at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Three years later he was appointed to the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors, and became an assistant constructor at Portsmouth Dockyard. In 1888 he married Aquila Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of W. J. Anstey, foreman shipwright, of Portsmouth. They had two sons, one of whom, John Harper Narbeth, also became a chief constructor at the Admiralty.<br>
<br>In 1887 Narbeth was transferred to the staff of William H. White, director of naval construction at the Admiralty. After demonstrating his skill at design work he was eventually entrusted with the preparation of warship designs of gradually increasing size and importance, ultimately resulting in three types of battleship: <i>King Edward VII</i> class (of which eight ships were built), <i>Lord Nelson</i> class, and, most famous of all, the <i>Dreadnought</i>. These ships were described by him in a paper read in 1922 before the Institution of Naval Architects. All were larger and more powerful than their forerunners. The <i>Dreadnought</i> also embodied revolutionary changes recommended by a powerful committee over which Sir John Fisher had presided. They included an armament of all big guns, higher speed, turbine propulsion, and underwater protection. Sir Philip Watts, who had succeeded White at the Admiralty and was a member of the committee, prepared, with Narbeth's assistance, a number of alternative designs; the Board of Admiralty selected one which became the <i>Dreadnought</i>. Narbeth completed the detailed design, finding solutions to the many problems encountered with such an innovative vessel.<br>
<br>On promotion in 1912 to be a chief constructor, health reasons prompted Narbeth to request a change of duties, and he was made directly responsible to the director for the design and construction of minor war vessels; these included high-speed motor boats, oil-carrying ships, mine-sweepers, and sloops. He made improvements in the design of each of these widely differing types of vessel. He became joint secretary to the royal commission on fuel and engines under the chairmanship of Fisher. During the First World War Narbeth designed the <i>Flower</i>-class sloops, with special design measures and procedures to allow for these vessels and mine-sweepers to be built in large numbers in small shipyards in record time.<br>
<br>Improvements in aircraft during and after the war and their widening use in warfare led to demands from the navy for special ships to carry them. Sir Eustace Tennyson-D'Eyncourt, who had succeeded Watts as director, arranged for Narbeth, who from 1919 was assistant director, to deal with the new designs involved. A few seaplane carriers were first obtained by modifying merchant ships: then, by converting warships, notably the fast battle cruisers of <i>Courageous</i> class, carriers were produced with a deck suitable for landing or launching aircraft. Narbeth again contributed many innovative ideas to these projects, and worked closely with a joint Admiralty and Air Ministry technical committee over which he presided (1918&#150;23), resulting in ships which when completed were satisfactory to pilots and naval officers alike.<br>
<br>Narbeth retired in 1923. He was remembered for having an absolute fearlessness in confronting authority on matters of principle and a complete stubbornness if he believed he was right. In later years he became regarded as the &#145;father&#146; of the Institution of Naval Architects. His services were recognized by appointment as MVO (1906), CBE (1920), and CB (1923). During his retirement he qualified as a Methodist local preacher. He died at 63 Elmbridge Road, Gloucester, on 19 May 1944 and was cremated on 23 May.<br>
