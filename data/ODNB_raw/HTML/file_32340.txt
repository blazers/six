<span class="headword">Centlivres,  Albert van de Sandt</span>  (1887&#150;1966), <span class="occ">judge in South Africa</span>, was born at Newlands, Cape Town, on 13 January 1887, the third son and seventh of the eleven children of Frederick James Centlivres, director of companies and mayor of Rondebosch, and his wife, Albertina de Villiers. Matriculating with distinction at the South African College School in 1903 he went on, at the South African College, to academic achievements which included honours in classics and a Rhodes scholarship. At New College, Oxford, he took his BA (with second-class honours in jurisprudence) in 1909, and the following year, with third-class honours, his BCL. He had joined the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1910. In 1911 he was admitted as an advocate of the Cape provincial division, South Africa.<br>
<br>At first Centlivres's was the usual fate of the young advocate and he had the time in which to edit <span class="italic">Juta's Daily Reporter</span> and so consolidate and extend his knowledge of procedure. His practice began to prosper after two interruptions: a brief interlude in Southern Rhodesia and the eruption of the First World War, in which he served in South-West Africa as a private and after which he returned to civil life with, it is believed, a military discharge recording his education as &#145;fair&#146;. In 1916 he married Isabel, daughter of George Short, accountant and merchant of Cape Town; they had one son, who predeceased his father, and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1927 Centlivres became a KC. It was as a lawyer rather than an advocate that he was achieving a reputation. His preparation was as comprehensive as it was thorough, his arguments were closely packed, yet precise, and he was considered an expert on the law of wills. He took part in a number of important cases, among them being the &#145;heresy trial&#146;, <i>Du Plessis v. Synod of the Dutch Reformed church</i>, and <i>Hofmeyr v. Badenhorst</i>, a defamation case resulting from an election at Riversdale. It was perhaps a portent that in 1920 he had been appointed parliamentary draftsman, a post which, during fourteen years, gave him a special insight into statute law. After acting as a judge of the high court of South-West Africa in 1922 and of the Cape provincial division in 1932, 1933, and 1934, he was appointed a puisne judge of the Cape provincial division in February 1935. Four years later, in 1939, he was elevated to the appellate division. He was appointed chairman of the public service inquiry commission in 1944 and his investigations into the salaries and conditions of service of civil servants were notable for their effective celerity. In 1950 he succeeded E. F. Watermeyer as chief justice and in 1957 he retired after a period in the appellate division which, in length, had been exceeded only by Sir William Solomon.<br>
<br>While, in other legal fields, Centlivres was responsible for a number of notable judgments, as he was in the celebrated case <i>R. v. Milne and Erleigh</i> (1951), it is his pronouncements in the three most important constitutional cases in the history of South Africa which, in particular, have ensured for him the attention of posterity. These, <i>Harris v. Minister of the Interior</i> (1952), <i>Minister of the Interior v. Harris</i> (1952), and <i>Collins v. Minister of the Interior</i> (1956), represent a collision between cabinet and judiciary, and were the culmination of a government attempt to remove the coloured population from the common roll. Of the three cases the second is perhaps the most remarkable. Frustrated by the appellate division's insistence that the requirements for amending the entrenched clauses of the <span class="roman">South Africa Act</span> be respected, the house of assembly and the senate constituted themselves a superior high court of parliament. This was unanimously declared unconstitutional by the appellate division, the chief justice rejecting the contention that parliament could decide bicamerally that no previous court had the right finally to decide whether an act conformed with the requirements of the <span class="roman">South Africa Act</span>. His judgment in the first case was described by Professor E. N. Griswold, then dean of the Harvard law school, as &#145;a great judgement, deserving to rank with the best work of the judges who have contributed to the field of constitutional law&#146;  (<span class="italic">South African Law Journal</span>, 1957, 4). In the end the senate was &#145;packed&#146; and the number of judges of the appellate division was increased from five to eleven without consultation with the chief justice, who endured political attacks with dignified restraint. It was during this turbulent period that the chief justice represented South Africa at, for instance, the seventh legal convention of the Law Council of Australia (1952) and the conference on government under law at Harvard (1955). In his address at Harvard, &#145;The South African constitution and the rule of law&#146;, he forcibly reaffirmed his faith in the rule of law and the rights and dignity of the individual, causes for which he fought unceasingly after his retirement.<br>
<br>In 1951 Centlivres had succeeded J. C. Smuts as chancellor of the University of Cape Town and, after his retirement as chief justice, was unremitting, through word and action, symbol, meeting, and procession, in his refusal to accept government insistence that, wherever possible, the university should be restricted to white students only. On his installation as chancellor he had emphasized his attitude in his <span class="italic">Inaugural Address</span>:<blockquote>To put it positively, academic freedom, as I understood it, means the unrestricted right on the part of a University to decide for itself what it shall teach, how it shall teach it and whom it shall admit to be taught, as well as the unrestricted right to select as its teachers the best men and women available, whether they happen to have been born in South Africa or elsewhere.</blockquote>Sociable, unaffected, accessible, Albert Centlivres was typical of the English-speaking South African at his best. In action as well as word he was a democrat. Like Smuts, whom he knew well, he was happy climbing Table Mountain, and, when those days were over, his tall, craggy figure, with pipe, stick, and dog, could be seen ranging the walks of his neighbourhood. Honours burdened him little. He was an honorary DCL of Oxford, and an honorary LLD of the universities of Melbourne, Cape Town, and the Witwatersrand, and of Rhodes University. He was also an honorary fellow of New College and an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple. He died at Claremont, Cape Town, on 19 September 1966.<br>
