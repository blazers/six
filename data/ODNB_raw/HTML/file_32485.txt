<span class="headword">Coker,  Ernest George</span>  (1869&#150;1946), <span class="occ">civil and mechanical engineer</span>, was born at Wolverton, Buckinghamshire, on 26 April 1869, the son of George Coker, an engine fitter, and his wife, Sarah Tompkins. Educated at a private school from 1883 until 1887, he was an apprentice and then draughtsman in the London and North Western Railway carriage works at Wolverton. Evening study enabled him to enter the Normal School of Science, London, where he gained a first-class associateship in mechanics. A Whitworth scholarship in 1890 took him to Edinburgh University where he graduated BSc in engineering in 1892. The following year he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1896 with a first class in part one of the mechanical sciences tripos. In 1897 he took part two with a double distinction in the first class.<br>
<br>During college vacations Coker spent periods in the railway works at Wolverton and at Crewe where, in the testing house, he carried out experiments which probably aroused his interest in the stress and strain in materials in which he was later to specialize. In 1892 he became an assistant examiner in the Patent Office and retained this post while he was at Cambridge, but in 1898 he resigned to enter upon his career as an engineering educationist. He married in 1899 Alice Mary (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of Robert King, an engineer, of Wolverton. They then moved to Canada where Coker became assistant professor in civil engineering at McGill University, Montreal. Later he became an associate professor, and during the whole of the period worked as principal assistant to Henry Taylor Bovey, both at the university and in his private practice, testing materials of various kinds and doing experimental work on Canadian water power schemes.<br>
<br>In 1905 Coker returned to England to become professor of mechanical engineering and head of the department of civil engineering at Finsbury Technical College, London, where he built a new engineering laboratory described in his paper before the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1907. Here he began the experiments for which his name became known on the use of photo-elastic methods for the determination of stress distribution in metals, machines, and structures, devising apparatus and models for this work, publishing in the technical literature, and, from 1910, giving public demonstrations. All this work continued, including consulting engineering, when in 1914 he became professor of civil and mechanical engineering at University College, London. He later became dean of the faculty of engineering and director of the engineering laboratories; he retired in 1934 as professor emeritus.<br>
<br>Coker's chief work, <span class="italic">A Treatise on Photo-Elasticity</span> (1931), was written jointly with L. N. G. Filon. He delivered the thirteenth Thomas Hawksley lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1926 (&#145;Elasticity and plasticity&#146;), and a lecture given to the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1935, &#145;The design and equipment of photo-elastic laboratories&#146;, summed up much of his life's work, which had an international reputation in its rather limited field. He was elected FRS in 1915, was also FRSE, and a member of the leading engineering societies, from which he received many medals, including the Thomas Hawksley medal (1922) from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Telford medal (1921) from the Institution of Civil Engineers, and the gold medal of the Institution of Naval Architects (1911). The Royal Society awarded him the Rumford medal in 1936, and from the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, he received the Howard N. Potts (1922) and Louis E. Levy (1926) medals. He was also an honorary DSc of the universities of Sydney and Louvain.<br>
<br>In person Coker was rather modest and retiring, and he was happiest when in his laboratory. Coker was living at 3 Farnley Road, Chingford, Essex, at the time of his death, which took place at 13 Miller Road, Ayr, on 9 April 1946.<br>
