<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whetstone,  (Norman) Keith</span>  (1930&#150;2002), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 17 June 1930 at 51 Holywell Avenue, Monkseaton, Northumberland, the younger son of Albert Whetstone, journalist, and his wife, Hannah Elizabeth (Anne), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hubbard. His parents both came from Nuneaton in Warwickshire, his father the son of a hatmaker and his mother the eldest daughter of the company secretary at a brickworks. They had moved north in 1928, seven years after their marriage, so that Albert Whetstone could work for the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Sun</span>. They later moved to Coventry, where Albert Whetstone rejoined the staff of the <span class="italic">Midland Daily Telegraph</span>, forerunner of the <span class="italic">Coventry Evening Telegraph</span>. He later became editor of the <span class="italic">Coventry Standard</span>, the company's weekly title, and a Saturday morning orator, proclaiming a radical agenda from a soapbox in Nuneaton market. Whetstone was educated at Bygate Lane infants' school, Monkseaton, Northumberland (later made famous by the television series, <span class="italic">The Likely Lads</span>), and King Henry VIII Grammar School, Coventry. Evacuated in the wartime air-raids, he was billeted in the country town of Alcester with a childless couple whose kindness he later repaid as they grew old. At school his great love was rugby union. For three seasons he played for the first fifteen, the last as captain. He also played for Warwickshire schools, and later for Coventry Extra Firsts and the Old Coventrians. Much later, as his sons followed him through the same school, earning the same rugby colours, he actively supported the school, the sport, and the old boys' association, whose president he became.<br>
<br>Following his father into journalism had to wait on the navy. Whetstone's elder brother, Tony (<i>b</i>. 1927), later a rear-admiral, was already serving in submarines when Whetstone himself joined the Royal Navy in 1949&#150;50 for his national service. As a young journalist on the <span class="italic">Coventry Evening Telegraph</span> in 1951, he was recalled because of the Korean War. On 6 December 1952 he married Monica Joan Clayton (<i>b</i>. 1930/31), the daughter of William Allan Clayton, company director, of Leamington Spa, and they set up home in Plymouth. He decided not to apply for a permanent commission, and on his demobilization at the end of 1952 joined the <span class="italic">Western Morning News</span> as a reporter, though he remained in the RNVR, retiring as a lieutenant-commander in 1965. He and his wife had three sons, Bill, Neil, and Alastair.<br>
<br>After three years as a journalist in Plymouth, Whetstone returned in 1955 to the midlands as a sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>, the first of many posts he held on Iliffe newspapers over the next thirty years. In 1958 he rejoined the <span class="italic">Coventry Evening Telegraph</span> as theatre critic, leaving to edit the <span class="italic">Cambridge Evening News</span> in 1964 but returning in 1970 as editor. Ten years later he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Birmingham Evening Mail</span> and a director of Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd. From 1984 to 1986 he was editor-in-chief of both the morning and evening papers before retiring as a precautionary ill-health measure at the age of fifty-six.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Whetstone set nothing higher than the work of the reporter and the &#145;sub&#146;. From his tobacco tin he would fish scraps of paper on which were noted stories culled from his wide circle of friends and contacts. As a grammarian he had few equals. He was immensely well-read and frequently exercised a phenomenal memory. But it was the quality of his judgement and the soundness of his integrity that won him advancement. He was trusted by everyone. When an Iliffe newspaper needed to be rebuilt on safer footings, Whetstone was the chosen man. When the public interest had to be served by the breaking of a story, nothing would compromise his principles, neither a treasured association, nor friendships he would be compelled to jeopardize. Journalism was his passion, and he was thrilled to see it shared by others, especially the young. Even from his retirement home at Prayssac, Lot, France, he would travel to run exam centres in the west midlands and return with armfuls of papers to mark. Invariably he thought standards to be falling. Things were never as good as they had been, but his enthusiasm as a guardian of professional values went undiminished.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Whetstone fought for the freedom of the press, not for its own sake, but for the benefit of the public. He did much to make the Guild of British Newspaper Editors (later the Society of Editors) a lobbying force. He was chairman of its parliamentary and legal committee and in 1976&#150;7 its national president. From 1980 to 1986 he was a member of the Press Council (later succeeded by the Press Complaints Commission). He also served on the D-notices committee, which advised editors on the reporting of defence and security issues. In 1983 he was appointed OBE for services to journalism.<br>
<br>Unlike his father, Whetstone was driven not by change but by conservatism. Even when the past seemed undeserving of respect, he gave it. To that extent he could be exasperating. But he was kind, honourable, generous, hospitable, supportive, loyal, charming, and gifted, even as a plumber, electrician, and joiner. His happiest times came with companionship and a good story, whether in the wardroom, the dressing room, or the dining room&#151;and with the clunk of metal type in a page of the next edition. He died on 1 September 2002 from prostate cancer at Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry, near his second home at Meriden, and was cremated on 9 September. He was survived by his wife, Monica, and their three sons.<br>
