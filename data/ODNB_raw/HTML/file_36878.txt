<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whitmore, Sir  George Stoddart</span>  (1829&#150;1903), <span class="occ">army officer and police officer in New Zealand</span>, was born in Malta on 30 May 1829, the son of Lieutenant (later Major) George St Vincent Whitmore RE and his wife, Isabella Maxwell, the daughter of Sir John Stoddart, chief justice of Malta. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and destined for a conventional military career, but instead joined the Cape mounted rifles as an ensign in January 1847.<br>
<br>Whitmore flourished in irregular colonial warfare. In South Africa he distinguished himself in the Cape frontier wars of 1847 and 1850&#150;53, and participated in the 1848 defeat of the Boers at Boomplaats, the town where he married Eliza McGlocking about 1851. She died in the early 1860s after they had had three children. In May 1850 Whitmore was promoted lieutenant, and on return to England in 1854 was made captain in the 62nd (Wiltshire) regiment of foot that July. During service in the Crimea and elsewhere from 1855 (during which he was promoted brevet major in 1856, and earned the fourth class of the Turkish order of the Mejidiye) his courage was reconfirmed and his organizational skills finely honed. In 1858 and 1860 (interrupted by a spell as aide-de-camp to the commander of forces in Canada) he attended the staff college at Aldershot and passed with top marks.<br>
<br>In 1861 Whitmore became military secretary to Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron, the newly appointed commander of the imperial forces in New Zealand. But, tiring of the prevailing truce with &#145;rebel&#146; Maori, he resigned in 1862 to improve a sheep and cattle run he now co-owned at Rissington, near Napier. Soon a JP, he combined a ruthless but efficient run-holding operation with many political, military, and bureaucratic positions in the colonial state, and was also a volunteer on Cameron's staff when war against Maori broke out again in 1863. That year alone he became civil commissioner for his region, a legislative councillor, in command of the local militia, and chief inspector and then commandant in the colonial defence force. On a visit to England on 11 March 1865 he married Isabella, the daughter of William Smith of Roxeth; they had no children.<br>
<br>As head of the local militia, Whitmore made his mark by decisively crushing a small invasion of &#145;rebels&#146; at Omarunui on 12 October 1866. In March 1868 he was appointed commandant of the armed constabulary, a militarized police body founded to &#145;pacify&#146; the supposedly defeated Maori. But with renewed &#145;rebellion&#146; from the forces of Te Kooti Rikirangi and Titokowaru, on the eastern and western seaboards of the North Island respectively, he was given the task of transforming the armed constables into soldiers, and reforming all colonial military forces.<br>
<br>Whitmore now led the campaigns for which he became famous, switching from side to side of the island in pursuit of the &#145;rebel&#146; chiefs. In effect commander-in-chief of the forces, he was elevated to full colonel on 21 October 1868, and created CMG in 1869. Despite losing key battles against Te Kooti (Ruakituri, 8 August 1868) and Titokowaru (Moturoa, 7 November 1868), he redeemed himself by defeating the former's forces at Ngatapa (5 January 1869) and penetrating his mountain sanctuary that May, and, in between, by pursuing the remnants of Titokowaru's forces after they abandoned their fortress at Tauranga-ika. Although there were further incidents of rebellion, the backbone of resistance to the state had been broken. However, in mid-1869 the inability of the colonial forces to capture the two &#145;rebel&#146; chiefs led to the fall of the &#145;war policy&#146; ministry. The new premier, William Fox, sought quickly to demilitarize the armed constabulary, since the colonial military had largely secured peace in the countryside. At the end of July 1869 command of the armed constabulary was stripped from Whitmore (ostensibly on grounds of ill health) and given to a career policeman.<br>
<br>During his arduous campaigning, Whitmore had sat in the Hawke's Bay provincial council (1867&#150;9), and he remained involved in politics, notably as a legislative councillor, as well as farming for the rest of his life. On 18 October 1877 he became colonial secretary in Sir George Grey's Liberal administration, and on 1 January 1878 he was also appointed commissioner of the recently formed New Zealand constabulary force, which combined the colony's policing and military functions. He sought to improve the colony's external defences against the supposed foe, Russia, including by ordering heavy harbour-defence guns. Internally, the job of control and surveillance of both Maori and Europeans gave him considerable authority. That the commissioner was also a minister made him even more powerful. But it also meant that he lost both positions as a result of Grey's fall on 8 October 1879. He was created KCMG in 1882.<br>
<br>In August 1884 Whitmore entered the twelve-day Stout&#150;Vogel ministry as minister without portfolio, and, some time after Stout and Vogel returned to power, he was appointed commander of the forces on 27 April 1885. In November of that year he was again gazetted commissioner of the New Zealand constabulary force (as well as under-secretary for defence). His major job in the Stout&#150;Vogel ministry was to restructure the colony's coercive forces, to reflect both the state of internal tranquillity and further fears of Russian intentions. On 1 September 1886, when separate policing and military organizations were established, Whitmore added to his duties as the most senior military officer and military bureaucrat in New Zealand that of the founding commissioner of the New Zealand police force. He was commissioner only long enough to place the force on a firm footing before resigning on 31 December 1886; meanwhile, on 4 December, his position as linchpin of the colonial forces was recognized when he became the first New Zealander to attain the rank of major-general.<br>
<br>In January 1888 Whitmore resigned from his military positions to return to politics, having abandoned his earlier association with radical politicians. In 1902, while on his way to England to publish <span class="italic">The Last Maori War in New Zealand under the Self-Reliant Policy</span>, a stroke partially paralysed him. On 16 March 1903, shortly after his return to New Zealand, he died at the Blue Cottage, Napier, Hawke's Bay; he was buried in the local cemetery.<br>
<br>Whitmore combined courage in the field with considerable organizational capacity. He fell out with most people, subordinates and superiors, European and Maori, but dominated the New Zealand politico-military/policing scene for two decades because of his superior abilities.<br>
