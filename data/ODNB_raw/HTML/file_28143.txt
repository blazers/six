<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Robert Alfred</span>  (1823&#150;1857), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and writer</span>, was born at Worcester on 18 March 1823, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28142/', "Robert Vaughan (1795&#150;1868)")</script>, also a Congregational minister, and his wife, Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryall. He was two months premature and never robust. Educated first by his father, he entered University College School, London, in 1836 at the age of thirteen. He passed on to University College, from which he graduated BA with classical honours in 1842. Vaughan's prevailing tastes were literary, and he believed that the life of a scholar clergyman would be congenial to his reserved temperament. In 1843 he became a student in the Lancashire Independent college, Manchester, under his father's presidency. Next year he published his first piece, <span class="italic">The Witch of Endor</span>, an unremarkable three-act dramatic poem. On his father's encouragement, he read Origen for a long, scholarly article published in the <span class="italic">British Quarterly</span> (October 1845). It won the commendations of Sir James Stephen and Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd. In 1846 he contributed a dramatic piece, &#145;Edwin and Elgiva&#146;, to the <span class="italic">London University Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Having finished his course in Manchester, Vaughan spent a session (1846&#150;7) at the University of Halle, where he came under the influence of Julius M&uuml;ller and Tholuck. A religious and psychological crisis made him doubt his vocation for a time. He decided that the work of his life was to be the production of a series of ecclesiastical dramas to illustrate the history of the church. Between June and October 1847 he travelled in Italy with his father.<br>
<br>In April 1848 Vaughan became assistant to the octogenarian William Jay at Argyle Chapel, Bath. It was an unfortunate appointment. The congregation were accustomed to Jay's forceful preaching and not all of them took kindly to the very different style of an introverted, scholarly young man who while he was at the chapel was writing articles for the <span class="italic">British Quarterly</span> on Schleiermacher and Savonarola and planning his work on the mystics. A few months after his installation, on 7 June 1848 he married Jane (<i>b</i>. 1827/8), the only child of James Finlay, a bookseller, of Newcastle upon Tyne. With his new financial responsibilities in mind, he stated that the condition of his remaining at the chapel was to be co-pastor with Jay. This was not acceptable either to Jay or to the deacons, and Vaughan therefore resigned, preaching his last sermon on 24 March 1850.<br>
<br>Accepting a call from Ebenezer Chapel, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham, Vaughan was ordained there on 8 September 1850. The fact that the ordination prayer was offered by John Angell James shows that he had not lost the confidence of the Congregationalist establishment. However, he was unsuited, both in health and temperament, to minister to a large congregation. While his health declined, he overworked himself in his study. He was learning Spanish and Dutch (being already proficient in French, German, and Italian) to gain access to the writings of mystics, and was contributing constantly to the <span class="italic">British Quarterly</span>. In the autumn of 1854 he visited Glasgow, but declined a call to succeed Ralph Wardlaw. He returned home ill. In the spring of 1855 he showed symptoms of tuberculosis; he resigned his charge, preaching his last sermon on 24 June. In August he put to press his <span class="italic">Hours with the Mystics</span>, which was published in March 1856.<br>
<br>This followed Vaughan's own design and interspersed a series of dialogues with studies in narrative form. The literally minded reviewer in the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span> declared, &#145;This sort of literary olio is not at all to our taste&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, 1856, 573). The book is extremely broad in scope, ranging from the early oriental mystics, the Neoplatonists, and the Sufis to Teresa of Avila, George Fox, and the Swedenborgians. The overall approach is sympathetic, but infused with Vaughan's English protestant prejudices.<br>
<br>The brief remainder of Vaughan's life was that of an invalid at Bournemouth, St John's Wood, and Westbourne Park, London. Yet he continued to contribute articles to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> as well as to the <span class="italic">British Quarterly</span>. He died at 19 Alexander Street, Westbourne Park, on 26 October 1857; his wife survived him. An enlarged edition of <span class="italic">Hours with the Mystics</span> appeared in 1860, edited by his father, while a third edition (1880) was edited by his son Wycliffe Vaughan.<br>
