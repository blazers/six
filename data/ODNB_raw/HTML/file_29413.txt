<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkie, Sir  David</span>  (1785&#150;1841), <span class="occ">painter of genre, historical subjects, and portraits</span>, was born on 18 November 1785 in the manse at Cults, in the parish of Pitlessie, Fife, where he was baptized on 4 December 1785, the third of the five children of the Revd David Wilkie (1738&#150;1812), and his third wife, Isabella (<i>c</i>.1762&#150;1824), daughter of James Lister, farmer at Pitlessie Mill.<h2>
<a name="TheearlyyearsinFifeandEdinburgh"></a>The early years in Fife and Edinburgh</h2>Wilkie's schooling, locally at Kettle and Cupar, drew nothing out of him. His conspicuous gift, precociously apparent, lay in the observation of human behaviour. His way forward was to turn this to advantage, and so, helped by influential neighbours, he applied for admission to the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh&#151;so called for being administered by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures, and Improvements in Scotland. He was there from 1799 to 1804, under the mastership of John Graham, who had recently returned from London and established a curriculum which involved not only drawing but, unusually, painting. Among fellow pupils were John Burnet and William Allan. Graham instituted prizes for small history pictures, and in 1803, with John Clerk of Eldin as examiner, Wilkie took the first with <span class="italic">Diana and Callisto</span> (Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, Virginia). In Fife he kept himself by painting portraits cheaply, adopting the fashionable style of Henry Raeburn in a number of them; the grandest and most original is <span class="italic">William Bethune-Morison and Family</span> (1804; NG Scot.). His creative energy, on the other hand, went into furthering his ambition, already set, to tell stories of common life on the patterns offered by David Allan, and by the seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish genre painters; they were, chiefly, Adriaen van Ostade and David Teniers the younger, known to him then almost wholly through prints. The summit of his achievement in this direction, premonitory of much to come, was the panoramic <span class="italic">Pitlessie Fair</span> (1804&#150;5; NG Scot.), an uneasy aggregate of rustic incident, yet full of observant and inventive passages. By the time it was finished, Wilkie realized that Scotland offered no future, and had decided on going to London.<h2>
<a name="London18051812"></a>London, 1805&#150;1812</h2>Wilkie arrived in London on 20 May 1805, and by early July he had informally attached himself to the Royal Academy Schools, where he threw himself into study, and was formally enrolled on 28 November. He was now twenty-one.<br>
<br>Wilkie had come with little money, and lived in penury such that after a few months he feared he would have to desert his one talent and return home. Again to support himself he resorted to what he called his old trade in portraiture, an art for which he always felt himself unfitted. Nevertheless, he had brought with him <span class="italic">Pitlessie Fair</span>, which he appears to have lent to the royal piano maker William Stodart, the first to order portraits from him. Through him the picture was seen by others, leading to a commission in January 1806 from the third earl of Mansfield for <span class="italic">Village Politicians</span> (exh. RA, 1806; priv. coll.). In the exposition and control of its subject it marks a rapid advance. Its text was taken from &#145;Scotland's skaith&#146;, a versified plea for temperance by Hector McNeill, but it was not for any social topicality that the picture drew immediate attention among academicians. The hanging committee for that year's exhibition placed it in a prime position, and Henry Fuseli, lately the professor of painting, said, &#145;Young man, that is a dangerous work&#146;  (Cunningham, 1.116). He sensed, without doubt, that this fierce declaration of naturalism, shaped in the old manner of the Low Countries, questioned the Franco-Italian values of history painting, promulgated for a century; equally, it challenged the sweet ruralism of Francis Wheatley, W. R. Bigg, and George Morland. Some likened Wilkie's early pictures to the poems of George Crabbe. The present picture quickly attracted two substantial and later friendly patrons: Sir George Beaumont, who commissioned the <span class="italic">Blind Fiddler</span> (exh. RA, 1808; Tate collection); and Lord Mulgrave, who commissioned <span class="italic">Rent Day</span> (exh. RA, 1809; priv. coll.). In 1807 the president of the Royal Academy, Benjamin West, had considered Wilkie &#145;already a great artist&#146;, and <span class="italic">Card Players</span> (exh. RA, 1808; priv. coll.) was commissioned for William Frederick, second duke of Gloucester.<br>
<br>This group of pictures had its culmination in two works, larger and more complex, aimed at the top of the market. In 1809 Wilkie began the <span class="italic">Village Festival</span> (exh. RA, 1812; Tate collection) as a speculation, having become wary of the exigencies that commissions could impose; J. J. Angerstein added it to his collection of old masters in 1811. In that year Wilkie began <span class="italic">Blind-Man's-Buff</span> (exh. RA, 1813; Royal Collection), commissioned by the prince regent through West. This act of patronage, in keeping with the prince's taste for Dutch pictures, was to have an effect on Wilkie's later career. These works show progressive mastery, not only in Wilkie's management of the relationships, in mind and action, between the people in the scenes he created, but especially in the rendering of their individualities. This latter skill, widely appreciated at the time, owed much to the researches being made into the physiognomy of expression by Charles Bell.<br>
<br>In 1809 Wilkie&#151;encouraged by Fuseli, Joseph Farington, and others&#151;put his name down for election as an associate of the Royal Academy, and was admitted on 6 November, although a year short of the statutory age of twenty-five; he did not cease to draw in the Academy Schools. Despite a hostile faction, using Edward Bird as its stalking-horse, he was elected Royal Academician on 11 February 1811. Also in 1811 he moved to the first of four successive addresses in the suburb of Kensington (none surviving), for the sake of better air than that north of Oxford Street, where he had lodged before. In 1812 Wilkie took public stock of himself by holding a one-man exhibition, an unusual procedure. Of the twenty-nine pictures, seven had been exhibited before. The more important he borrowed; the earliest was <span class="italic">Pitlessie Fair</span> and the most recent the <span class="italic">Village Festival</span>. Among the others was a deeply felt and loving portrait of his parents (priv. coll.), painted on a visit home in 1807.<br>
<br>During the exhibition, subscriptions were taken for a forthcoming engraving by Abraham Raimbach after <span class="italic">Village Politicians</span>. In 1809 Wilkie had begun to have engravings made from a number of his pictures. This fairly common practice was valuable in keeping an artist's work in the public eye. For Wilkie there must also have been the hope that the need to paint portraits would be reduced by the sale of prints; bread and butter was certainly to come from this source for the rest of his life. His first and best interpreters were Burnet and Raimbach, who worked in the line manner he preferred; early on they joined him as publishers, but later this and the business of distribution went into commercial hands. In his lifetime, prints went to France, the Low Countries, Germany, Spain, America, and India. At home especially they became the source of many copies and pastiches.<h2>
<a name="London18121825"></a>London, 1812&#150;1825</h2>Wilkie's first seven assertive years in London were followed by a decade or so as active, his work now conveying a sense of having been painted with the confidence of an established master. The texture of his paint became creamier, his colour more mellow&#151;tone was to become an absorption&#151;his line more beguiling, his penetration of character more searching. The period may be said to open with the <span class="italic">Letter of Introduction</span> (exh. RA, 1814; NG Scot.), a composition of two figures in which a gulf of acute awkwardness is opened between a complacent youth and the suspicious recipient of the letter, a tetchy old man of taste. Their arrangement echoes examples from the Low Countries, but not now the peasantry of Ostade and Teniers; rather, and significantly, Dutch painters of comfortable interiors&#151;in this case, openly enough, Gerard ter Borch. Burnet wrote: &#145;It was a common practice with Wilkie to adopt a part of a celebrated work as a point to work from &hellip; The spectator, by this means, was drawn into a predisposition of its excellence&#146;  (J. Burnet, <span class="italic">Rembrandt</span>, 1849, 40). The allurement had warrant in the example of Sir Joshua Reynolds, of whom Wilkie was a constant admirer.<br>
<br>Among Wilkie's finest achievements, for its large groupings and emotional range, is <span class="italic">Distraining for Rent</span> (exh. RA, 1815; NG Scot.), a &#145;sadly real&#146; subject, open to political interpretation, although not intentionally. Bought by the directors of the British Institution, who collected to encourage British artists and to provide examples for students, it was the first of Wilkie's pictures to enter a public collection; he was to have the then singular distinction of having pictures in the National Gallery during his lifetime, when Angerstein's and Beaumont's collections went there in 1824 and 1826.<br>
<br>Wilkie returned to Scotland only intermittently, and never without purpose. In 1817, in search of subject matter, he made his only visit to the highlands, where the way of life was strange to him, a lowlander. He had asked advice on what to see from Walter Scott, whom he visited at Abbotsford on the way back. The major outcome of this ethnographic tour was to be <span class="italic">Highland Whisky-Still at Lochgilphead</span> (exh. British Institution, 1820; priv. coll.), bespoken in 1819, on the strength of a sketch, by Major-General Sir Willoughby Gordon, a lasting patron.<br>
<br>The prince regent had already asked for a second picture, and in 1817 Wilkie's consummately vivacious <span class="italic">Penny Wedding</span> (exh. RA, 1819; Royal Collection) was begun. The subject, from the lowlands, looks back to the century before, fixing details of a disappearing way of life, as in novels by Scott and John Galt. Before work on this was finished, an order came from Maximilian I of Bavaria, likewise for a subject of Wilkie's own choosing, and in 1819 he began <span class="italic">Reading a Will</span> (exh. RA, 1820; Neue Pinakothek, Munich). In the catalogue of the exhibition at the Royal Academy he tagged it with a reference to an episode in Scott's story of <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span> (1815), which it does not illustrate, but which he re-created in his own manner. Although the opening of a will had been proposed to Wilkie as a subject a decade earlier by the actors John Liston and John Bannister&#151;he had a taste for plays&#151;this does not account for a staginess in the picture. This almost certainly came from his use, for some years about this time, of a device in the formation of a composition, old but not much used in his day. Into a small box with an open side were placed clay models, as in a theatre; this allowed their arrangement and lighting to be considered before transfer to the canvas. It was noticed of this picture that the proportion of the figures to their setting was larger than before. The development became conspicuous in <span class="italic">Parish Beadle</span> (exh. RA, 1823; Tate collection), also noticeable in which are a loosening in the handling of the paint and a forcefulness of light and shadow; Fuseli detected a look of Guercino, others of Rembrandt. The change of style thus adumbrated was not, however, apparent in his small, genially domestic portrait of the <span class="italic">Duke of York</span> (exh. RA, 1823; NPG), also painted for Gordon.<br>
<br>If Wilkie had misgivings about his competence to be a portrait painter, he had a less understandable lack of confidence in his ability to paint landscape. He felt his inexperience while painting the trees and sky in the <span class="italic">Village Festival</span>, and set out to improve himself. For ten years or so he exercised himself in the art, and made a number of accomplished studies, stimulated by an amateur landscapist, his friend Perry Nursey. He chose to exhibit only one landscape, the large <span class="italic">Sheepwashing</span> (exh. British Institution, 1817; NG Scot.), having explained to Beaumont, another amateur: &#145;My ambition is not more than that of enabling myself to paint an out-door scene with facility&#146;  (Cunningham, 1.454). But only a handful of his subjects had landscape backgrounds, and after 1825 he gave up landscape painting altogether.<br>
<br>In 1820 Wilkie began the work by which he is most widely known, <span class="italic">Chelsea Pensioners</span> (exh. RA, 1822; Apsley House, London). The duke of Wellington, who was to become a friend, had come to him in 1816 for a picture, saying, &#145;the subject should be a parcel of old soldiers assembled &hellip; at the door of a public-house, chewing tobacco and talking over their old stories&#146;. Agreeing that this would make a picture, Wilkie added that &#145;it only wanted some &hellip; principal incident to connect the figures together&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon</span>, 1.246). The outcome was a subject pretending to represent the reception of the news from Waterloo by pensioners and others outside the public houses near Chelsea Hospital. It is, in effect, a history picture with an invisible hero, the popular joy being in the victory of the nation rather than of a commander. Of great intricacy, &#145;composed rather than inspired&#146;, a contemporary remarked  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 1842, 585), it was admired for its &#145;expressions touchantes&#146; by the French painter Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault  (C. Cl&eacute;ment, <span class="italic">G&eacute;ricault</span>, 1867, 202), and at the exhibition it had to be protected from the crowds by a rail; the entrance-money taken at the Royal Academy that year was the highest ever. The duke paid the exceptional sum of &pound;1260 for the picture, in cash.<br>
<br>Later in 1822 George IV went on a state visit to Edinburgh, to be presented there as the king of Scotland at home in his Scottish capital. Wilkie went also, hoping to find in the pageantry of the occasion, largely orchestrated by his friend Scott, a subject for a second modern history picture. At about the same time he was giving thought to a subject from Presbyterian history. Both were to come. In 1823 Wilkie was informed by the home secretary, Sir Robert Peel, who was to become a patron, that the king had chosen him to succeed Raeburn as limner for Scotland. A state portrait of the king was thus expected from him, although he had never painted a formal portrait, indeed any at full length and of life size. An opportunity for trying his hand came in 1824, when an invitation came from Fife to paint the earl of Kellie for the county hall. He went to Scotland again that year and got the portrait well under way, also gathering materials for his two pictures of Scottish history, present and past.<h2>
<a name="Onthecontinent18251828"></a>On the continent, 1825&#150;1828</h2>Each of the years from 1824 to 1826 brought calamity. Since his father's death Wilkie's mother had become the centre of his London home. She died in 1824; the year in which his eldest brother, John, also died, in India. His other older brother, James, died in 1825. Both brothers left children to be taken care of, some of whom Wilkie had already been supporting. He had long been prone to nervous illness, brought on by anxiety; now he had fresh financial responsibilities. Professionally, he worried over his burden of work, not least that arising from his royal appointment. By the spring of 1825 he had become too tense to write, or to paint. Travel was advised as a relief. While he was abroad, his income from engravings was to be undermined by the failure of his print publisher in the crash of 1826.<br>
<br>Wilkie had travelled before, to Paris in 1814 and to the Low Countries in 1816, essentially to see pictures. Although he was alert to work done recently by the French, his chief interest on both journeys had been in Dutch and Flemish painters of the seventeenth century; the grandeur of Rubens was a particular revelation. Now, in July 1825, he set off on a grand tour, centred on Rome, with an excursion into Germany in 1826. The high Renaissance painters who impressed him greatly were Raphael, Michelangelo, and Fra Bartolommeo, and of the later sixteenth century, Titian and Correggio. Returning, he made a diversion into Spain, then scarcely known to painters. He went there not least in the hope of finding old masters for Peel, as he had been doing in Italy. He spent six months over the winter of 1827 in Madrid, making a trip to Seville; new and exciting to a British painter, was the encounter with major works by Vel&aacute;zquez and Murillo. It may be judged that of all these painters, Raphael, Titian, Correggio, and Murillo had the most evident effect on his practice, although by other means he had already arrived at an understanding of the discipline of Raphael and the colouring of Titian.<br>
<br>In Rome, Wilkie painted three modest scenes of pious observances seen during Holy Week, to which he added a fourth, painted at Geneva during a lengthy pause after leaving Italy, over the summer of 1827. At Madrid, where he enjoyed the company of Washington Irving, he finished a picture, and began three others, on the subject of Spanish resistance to the French occupation. These four clearly announce a new stylistic ambition. They are generous in scale, the figures large and forward in the picture space, the whole executed, as never before, with rapidity and freedom. Each of these characteristics was virtually imposed in consequence of his illness; his old ability to paint small and in detail had been taken from him. His achievement on the continent of a new style and a way forward was in accord with his previously apparent pursuit of old masterliness. Materially, he tried for richness and transparency by using bitumen. After two or three decades this treacherous tarry compound almost invariably degenerated, so disfiguring many of his larger late pictures, and making their original impact hard to judge nowadays.<h2>
<a name="London18281840"></a>London, 1828&#150;1840</h2>After an absence of three years Wilkie was home again in July 1828. The king received him generously, buying two of the Italian pictures, as well as all four of the Spanish ones, the largest and most vigorous of which is the <span class="italic">Defence of Saragossa</span> (exh. RA, 1829; Royal Collection). The intermediary in this was Sir William Knighton, who himself became a patron and a confidant.<br>
<br>Of the work Wilkie had left unfinished in 1825, the <span class="italic">Earl of Kellie</span> (exh. RA, 1829; County Hall, Cupar, Fife) was soon completed. A portrait, <span class="italic">George IV in Highland Dress</span> (exh. RA, 1830; Royal Collection), the fulfilment of his duty as limner, was not judged a very good likeness, but Wilkie thought the tartan outfit in which he had seen the king at Edinburgh so rich &#145;that one might fancy Vel&aacute;squez, Rembrandt, and Titian ambitious of such a model&#146;  (letter to Prince D. Dolgoruky, 1839, Yale University Library, New Haven, Connecticut). The history picture commemorating the king's visit to the city, begun a year after the event, was the <span class="italic">Entrance of George IV at Holyrood House</span> (exh. RA, 1830; Royal Collection), over 6 feet long. Although incorporating portraits, it has almost no documentary value, being a fancy kindred to Scott's when he invented the spectacle for the occasion; none the less the picture remains a serious construction, Rubensian in derivation.<br>
<br>The fourth unfinished work was the other history picture begun in 1823, the large <span class="italic">Preaching of Knox before the Lords of the Congregation</span> (exh. RA, 1832; Tate collection); it went to Peel. Wilkie was shortly to write: &#145;The question of Catholic and Protestant I have considered a theme for art&#146;  (Cunningham, 3.113); his interest in the theme had been deepened by his observations on the continent. The picture was critically received as an assured achievement in the historical branch of art.<br>
<br>The king appointed Wilkie his painter in ordinary in 1830, in succession to Sir Thomas Lawrence; he was confirmed in the office later that year by William IV, and in 1837 by Queen Victoria. He found state portraits difficult; they, and repetitions from them, took much time. With Queen Victoria he failed, and lost favour. His office under the crown, as well as the need of money despite his economical way of life, made it difficult for him to avoid requests for full-length formal portraits of persons of eminence, among them <span class="italic">Viscount Melville</span> (exh. RA, 1831; University of St Andrews); the <span class="italic">Duke of Wellington as Constable of the Tower</span> (exh. RA, 1834; Merchant Taylors' Company, London); and a lord mayor of London, <span class="italic">M. P. Lucas</span> (exh. RA, 1839; Guildhall Art Gallery, London). He continued to paint private portraits.<br>
<br>Although Wilkie had returned from the continent with a new style, it would appear that for the next ten years or so he had an imperfect sense of direction. This is, in a manner, indicated by the increase in the variety and originality of his subject matter: <span class="italic">Columbus in the Convent of La Rabida</span> (exh. RA, 1835; North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh) is one of six pictures on Spanish themes, one commissioned from New York; the <span class="italic">First Earring</span> (exh. RA, 1835; Tate collection), painted for John, sixth duke of Bedford, was the first of five pictures treating upper-class female domestic life. Reversions to scenes of cottage domesticity are represented by the <span class="italic">Cotter's Saturday Night</span> (exh. RA, 1837; Glasgow Art Gallery), a pious and moralizing subject found in the poem by Robert Burns and painted for the print publisher F. G. Moon. <span class="italic">Napoleon and the Pope</span> (exh. RA, 1836; NG Ire.)&#151;an encounter of 1813&#151;was painted for John Marshall, the Leeds linen manufacturer. Restricted to the two figures, &#145;my largest picture&#146; attracted remarks on matters of detail and on the nature of history painting, but none arising from the politics of the event shown. As surely as the picture of Knox preaching, this was a statement on the conflict between temporal and spiritual power. Thematically akin, and of a more immediate political pertinence, was the <span class="italic">Peep-o'-Day Boy's Cabin</span> (exh. RA, 1836; Tate collection), painted for Robert Vernon. Wilkie's Spanish subjects had been novel in British painting, and a success. In 1835, looking for more new material, he went to Ireland, until then visited only by a few English topographers. There, as in the highlands in 1817, his attraction was to the primitive in rural life. The picture described this; further, by centring the narrative on one of the old protestant bands, still at odds with the indigenous Catholic population, it opened the sensitive issue of political responsibilities in London.<br>
<br>Since Wilkie's return in 1828 a large number of his critics&#151;and of his public too, no doubt&#151;had felt disappointed when they found that he had abandoned his old subject matter and manner of presentation, above all the strong characterization that outshone his seventeenth-century models. Many had seen in Wilkie an heir to Hogarth; few can have been aware of the nervosity that had lowered his manual capacity. The feeling was, and persists even now, that a source of enlightening entertainment went when Wilkie Europeanized his style. Yet in this he was to venture further.<br>
<br>Wilkie had not been unwilling to enter into portraiture when he could blend it with history, so to invest it with anecdote; &#145;portraits in action&#146; was his phrase. One such picture had been that of George IV at Holyrood; another was to be the <span class="italic">First Council of Queen Victoria</span> (exh. RA, 1838; Royal Collection). Also of the sort, although the portrait in it was posthumous, is <span class="italic">Sir David Baird Discovering the Body of Tippoo Saib</span> (exh. RA, 1839; NG Scot.). Over 11 feet high, and the result of four years' work, this heroic image was begun in 1835 at the request of Baird's widow. Wilkie regarded it as a commission &#145;of first rate consequence&#146;  (Wilkie, MS letter to Knighton, 20 Sept 1834, Mitchell Library, Glasgow). If his phrase was portentive it might be explained by his interest in what he had seen of the revival of fresco painting in Rome and in Germany, and which, since the burning of the houses of parliament in 1834, had become a prospect in England.<br>
<br>In 1839 Wilkie began a still more forward-looking picture, <span class="italic">John Knox Dispensing the Sacrament at Calder House</span> (NG Scot.), a commercial undertaking to give Moon a subject for engraving as a companion to the existing print after the picture of Knox preaching. In formal contrast to the latter, this carefully deliberated composition is overtly formed on high Renaissance precedent. For Wilkie the scene concerned &#145;the restoration of a holy ordinance to its primitive simplicity&#146;  (Cunningham, 3.232). The painting was not to be finished.<h2>
<a name="TheHolyLand18401841"></a>The Holy Land, 1840&#150;1841</h2>As Wilkie was beginning the picture of Knox, he also began one of <span class="italic">Samuel Ministering before Eli</span>. Always careful to lend truth to his historical works by working from evidences of their period, this subject provoked questions about what the world of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> had looked like. On the continent he had already wondered at anachronisms in biblical paintings. Now he wrote to Gordon, who had commissioned the subject: &#145;The researches of travellers must assist greatly in the representation of Scripture subjects&#146;  (Wilkie, MS letter to Gordon, 21 Oct 1839, priv. coll.). David Roberts had shown him drawings he had recently made in Palestine, but Wilkie's allusion was rather to the rising number of illustrated accounts of the Levant published in the 1830s&#151;themselves part of a wider popular attraction to the region, raised by political, military, and missionary interests there.<br>
<br>On 15 August 1840 Wilkie left London for the Holy Land. Like most travellers then, he used the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as his guidebook. Intending only to gather authentic materials for further engagements in scriptural subjects, he limited his painting equipment to that necessary for making studies. He was to express his larger purpose in writing to Peel of &#145;the great work to be essayed of representing Scripture history&#146;  (Cunningham, 3.415); behind this was a democratic wish that, with government help, painting should be enjoyed at large in public places.<br>
<br>The war in Syria delayed Wilkie at Constantinople from October to January, so that he did not reach Jerusalem until February 1841. There his attention was largely drawn to remains associated with the life of Christ and to the manners of the existing Jewish community. At Jerusalem he made small compositions in oil, two of which survive in private collections. In them he presents scenes from the life of Christ in which the physical types, costumes, and settings are those about him in the city. At the age of fifty-six Wilkie seemed on the verge of a significant new departure.<br>
<br>Wilkie left Jerusalem for home in April. Waiting for a steamer at Alexandria he used the time to paint a small portrait, <span class="italic">The Pacha of Egypt</span> (Tate collection), as he had painted <span class="italic">The Sultan of Turkey</span> (Royal Collection) at Constantinople. Wilkie died of a sudden illness on 1 June 1841, aboard the SS <i>Oriental</i>; he was buried at sea, off Malta. At the Royal Academy, in the following year, his loss was marked by two imaginary representations of burial at sea: the <span class="italic">Funeral of Sir David Wilkie</span> (priv. coll.) by his friend George Jones, and <span class="italic">Peace: Burial at Sea</span> (Tate collection) by his old sparring partner J. M. W. Turner.<h2>
<a name="Afterword"></a>Afterword</h2>Wilkie was held in high esteem as a man and as an artist. Among artists, some particular friends were William Allan, Francis Chantrey, William Collins, John Constable, Andrew Geddes, B. R. Haydon, John Jackson, C. R. Leslie, and Thomas Phillips. When Lawrence died, Wilkie was near to succeeding him as president of the Royal Academy, but knew he was not constituted for so contentious an office. He was an honorary member of foreign academies; was made doctor of civil law at Oxford on 13 June 1834; was knighted on 15 June 1836; and in 1841 was nominated a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. On his death a public subscription was raised for a memorial, and in the end a marble statue by Samuel Joseph was presented to the National Gallery in 1844 (Tate collection). An extensive retrospective exhibition was mounted at the British Institution in 1842.<br>
<br>Wilkie revealed almost nothing of his private life, which was essentially domestic. In congenial surroundings he could be amusing; in his earlier years at least he played the fiddle. He did not marry, although he had at least one hope. By inference, he lost his Presbyterianism to the Church of England; his patriotism was as a Briton pleased to be Scottish. In the 1830 he went, if not very attentively, to meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; he does not appear to have been much given to reading, and he mastered no foreign language.<br>
<br>Of a number of surviving portraits of Wilkie, the most valuable are by William Beechey (exh. RA, 1809; Scot. NPG), Andrew Geddes (exh. RA, 1816; Scot. NPG), and Thomas Phillips (exh. RA, 1829; Scot. NPG); each was engraved. There is also a life mask of uncertain date (Scot. NPG). Of the few self-portraits, notable are those from 1805&#150;6 (Scot. NPG), 1813 (NPG), and 1840 (Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Pau).<br>
<br>Wilkie painted a total of some 500 works in oil, including some 170 portraits; many of these works were small studies and sketches, and about half the total can no longer be accounted for. Of the total, he exhibited in London eighty-seven subject pictures and thirty-seven portraits. He was a prolific and distinguished draughtsman, for figures perhaps the finest of his age; he exhibited six drawings at the Royal Academy. His will, made on 21 July 1825 and proved on 10 August 1841, provided that the contents of his studio, copyrights in prints, and personal effects&#151;his house was evidently leased&#151;should be sold, the proceeds to be held in trust for his sister Helen and brother Thomas, then portioned among nephews and nieces. The arrangement, complicated in its care for equity, resulted in sales by his trustees at Christies on 25&#150;30 April and 3&#150;4 May 1842, and on 20&#150;21 June 1860; the catalogues of these are greatly informative.<br>
<br>Latterly, Wilkie employed assistants, among them John Ballantyne, J. Z. Bell, Alexander Fraser, John Simpson, and W. S. Watson. He took an interest in the training of young painters, and gave them advice and letters of recommendation. Some painters, of genre in particular, developed from him. C. W. Cope, Daniel Maclise, and John Phillip are examples; others, such as Thomas Webster and Thomas Faed, simply followed in his footsteps. Wilkie's considerable influence on Victorian painting, which remains to be charted accurately&#151;so too his influence abroad&#151;was depressed variously by the aesthetic values of John Ruskin, J. A. M. Whistler, and Roger Fry. A reassessment was begun with the Wilkie exhibition at the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Academy in 1958.<br>
<br>Much of Wilkie's writing&#151;letters (many survive), journals (lost), and his &#145;Remarks on painting&#146;&#151;was published in 1843 by his first biographer, Allan Cunningham, whose account, although he made excisions and alterations on occasion, remains indispensable. The major collections of Wilkie's paintings are in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, and the Tate collection. There are substantial holdings of his drawings in Aberdeen Art Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, the British Museum, the Courtauld Institute, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
