<span class="headword">Pakenham, Sir  Hercules Robert</span>  (1781&#150;1850), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, third son of Edward Michael, second Baron Longford (1743&#150;1792), and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 12 March 1816), second daughter of Hercules Langford Rowley, was born on 29 September 1781. He was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21138/', "Sir Edward Michael Pakenham")</script>, and brother-in-law of the first duke of Wellington. He was appointed ensign 40th regiment on 23 July 1803, became lieutenant on 3 February 1804, was transferred to the 95th rifles in April the same year, and obtained his company there on 2 August 1805. He served in the expedition to Copenhagen and in Portugal, where he was wounded at Obidos on 16&#150;17 August 1808. &#145;He is really one of the best officers of riflemen I have seen,&#146; wrote Sir Arthur Wellesley, recommending him for promotion  (Gurwood, 3.129). He was promoted to a majority in the 7th West India regiment on 30 August 1810, but remained with the Peninsular army, and was assistant adjutant-general of Picton's division up to the storming of Badajos, where he was wounded.<br>
<br>After being repeatedly recommended for promotion, Pakenham was made a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 27 April 1812, was appointed lieutenant-colonel 26th Cameronians on 3 September 1812, and transferred as captain and lieutenant-colonel to the Coldstream Guards on 25 July 1814, from which he retired on half pay in 1817. He was made brevet colonel and aide-de-camp to the king on 27 May 1825, became a major-general on 10 January 1837, was appointed colonel 43rd light infantry on 9 September 1844, commanded the Portsmouth district from 1843 to 1846, and became a lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846. He was made CB on 4 June 1815 and KCB on 19 July 1838.<br>
<br>Pakenham married, in November 1817, Emily (<i>d</i>. 26 Jan 1875), fourth daughter of Thomas Stapylton, Lord Le Despenser; they had six sons (one of whom was killed at Inkerman and another at the relief of Lucknow) and three daughters. He died suddenly at his residence, Langford Lodge, co. Antrim, on 7 March 1850.<br>
