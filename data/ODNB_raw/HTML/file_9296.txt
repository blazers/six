<span class="headword">Fenton, Sir  Geoffrey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1539&#150;1608), <span class="occ">translator and administrator in Ireland</span>, was one of seven children (six sons, one daughter) of Henry Fenton from Stretton-le-Steeple in Nottinghamshire and Cicely, daughter of John Beaumont of Coleorton, Leicestershire. Little is known of Fenton's early life, but, as he acknowledges in his first published work, he travelled extensively, possibly to Spain and Italy, and definitely to France. Two of his works (<span class="italic">Actes of Conference in Religion</span> and <span class="italic">Monophylo</span>) are dedicated to Lady Elizabeth Hoby, widow of Sir Thomas Hoby, the ambassador to France, which suggests that Fenton may have been part of Hoby's entourage in Paris in the 1560s before the latter's early death in 1566.<br>
<br>Fenton had a productive career as a translator of French and Latin works. His first work, <span class="italic">Certain Tragicall Discourses of Bandello</span> (1567), was a translation of the Italian novels of Matteo Bandello, from the French translations made by Fran&ccedil;ois Belleforest and Pierre Boaisteau. The work was dated 22 June 1567 from his chamber at Paris and dedicated to Lady Mary Sidney; her husband, Sir Henry, was then lord deputy of Ireland. Fenton, whose choice of translations and prefatory comments to them indicates a staunchly protestant faith, appears to have gravitated towards the protestant faction at court. The dedicatory epistle contains fulsome praise of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, its unofficial leader. There were also a number of commendatory verses, including one by George Turberville.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Certain Tragicall Discourses</span> is one of the first collections of Italian prose fiction in English, along with William Painter's <span class="italic">Palace of Pleasure</span> (1566) and George Pettie's <span class="italic">The Palace of Pleasure</span> (1576). Fenton suggests, in line with contemporary humanist and protestant wisdom, that the variety of tales should be read as moral exempla, some&#151;such as the story of Lucrece&#151;showing fine moral behaviour that should be imitated, others revealing the dire effects of immoral behaviour. When Roger Ascham made his famous attack on the malign influence of Italian romance in <span class="italic">The Scholemaster</span> (1570), it is likely that he had Fenton's work in mind (although had he read the work carefully he might well have found it to be rather more orthodox than he assumed). <span class="italic">Certain Tragicall Discourses</span> is clearly one of Fenton's most important works and its influence was recognized by Thomas Warton who referred to it as &#145;the most capital miscellany&#146; of Italian novellas in English  (Warton, 3.478).<br>
<br>Fenton produced a number of translations in the next few years on political and religious subjects. <span class="italic">An Epistle or Godlie Admonition, of a Learned Minister of the Gospel &hellip; to the Pastoures of the Flemish Church in Antwerp</span> (1569) was a translation of a work pleading for unity in the church and dated 10 December 1569. <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Civile Warres and Late Troubles in Fraunce</span> appeared in 1570, dedicated to Sir Henry Sidney. In the prefatory epistle Fenton argued that it was vital for Englishmen to know about the horrors of the recent religious wars in France, and argued, as he had done with regard to prose fiction in his first work, that history taught a series of good and bad examples that should be imitated or avoided. The work was dated 24 May 1570, and gave Fenton's address as London. In 1571 he published a translation of a French religious treatise, <span class="italic">Actes of Conference in Religion, Holden at Paris</span>, dedicated to Lady Hoby, which sought to mediate between the extremes of Catholicism and protestant sectarianism, also written in London and dated 4 July 1571; a translation of a philosophical dialogue dealing with how to live a moral life, <span class="italic">Monophylo</span>, appeared in 1572, again dedicated to Lady Hoby, and dated 6 April 1572; <span class="italic">A Forme of Christian Pollicie</span>, another translation of a French work, appeared in 1574, dedicated to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and dated 16 May 1574 from the author's chambers in Blackfriars; and in 1575 Fenton published <span class="italic">Golden Epistles Contayning Varietie of Discourse both Morall, Philosophicall, and Divine</span>, dedicated to Burghley's daughter, Lady Anne, countess of Oxford, also written at his chambers in Blackfriars and dated 4 February 1575. This last work, a selection of letters offering advice and consolation, was popular enough to be reprinted twice.<br>
<br>In the next few years Fenton must have been at work on his most ambitious project, a translation of Francesco Guicciardini's <span class="italic">Storia d'Italia</span> from the French version. This eventually appeared in 1579 entitled <span class="italic">The Historie of Guicciardini</span>. It was dedicated to Elizabeth, perhaps indicating that Fenton was being rewarded by patrons for his work and was now moving in more exalted circles. The history narrated the conflicts between the various Italian city states and their allies between 1490 and 1534 and was a major work of European history. Fenton's translation had a significant influence on English historiography, especially the &#145;Tacitean&#146; history produced in the late 1590s, which tried to provide a detached view of political offices and processes. As in his earlier work, Fenton suggested that Guicciardini's history was best read as a series of good and bad examples. It was reissued in 1599 and in 1618 after Fenton's death. Fenton's son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3133/', "Richard Boyle, first earl of Cork")</script>, regarded the <span class="italic">Historie</span> as one of his most treasured possessions  (Canny, 28).<br>
<br>Fenton produced no more translations. In 1580 he went to live in Ireland, where his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9293/', "Edward Fenton (d. 1603)")</script> was serving as a captain under Sir William Pelham. Geoffrey may also have served under Pelham, because Pelham wrote to Sir Francis Walsingham on 16 February 1580 to recommend Fenton as a secretary to the new lord deputy, Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton, one of the earl of Leicester's clients. Fenton wrote to Burghley from Limerick on 22 July to say that he had been sworn in as secretary to Grey. Fenton would have served alongside Edmund Spenser, another secretary to Grey, who arrived with the lord deputy on 12 August. Spenser moved in the same protestant circles and they both married into the powerful and wealthy Boyle family in Munster.<br>
<br>Fenton married Alice, daughter of Dr Robert Weston, formerly lord chancellor of Ireland, and widow of Dr Hugh Brady, bishop of Meath, in June 1585. They had one son, Sir William Fenton, and a daughter, Catherine, who married Richard Boyle, later first earl of Cork, on 25 July 1603, making Fenton the grandfather of Robert Boyle and the dramatist Lord Orrery. Fenton's advice on land grants and law helped Boyle to secure his position as the richest man in the British Isles.<br>
<br>Fenton pursued an active career as a major civil servant in Ireland: his name appeared frequently in the state papers as a policy maker, adviser to the lord deputy, and channel of information and an informer to the queen. In this last role, unsurprisingly, he made a number of powerful enemies. Fenton delivered a message personally to Elizabeth in December 1580, which was probably the start of his close relationship with her. His official letters are notably eloquent and stylish.<br>
<br>Fenton assumed the role of principal secretary of state in Ireland in the 1580s, serving under a number of lord deputies until his death. He was also MP for Carlow (1585&#150;6). Fenton had a particularly unfortunate relationship with Sir John Perrot, lord deputy, 1584&#150;8. Fenton was sent to London in June 1585 to get the queen's permission to divert funds from St Patrick's College, Dublin, to the newly established protestant university in the city, Trinity College. He returned to Ireland after a prolonged stay in March 1586, bringing a whole series of charges against Perrot. Perrot retaliated by publicly humiliating Fenton, having him arrested on a charge of debt (he owed Perrot &pound;70), carried through the streets on a market day, and thrown into debtor's prison in January 1587. Fenton was eventually released on the orders of Elizabeth. From 1590 to 1591 Fenton was seconded to London to serve as a commissioner for the impeachment of Perrot. In 1589 he began a long-running feud with Sir Richard Bingham. Throughout Fenton's career complaints were made at the wealth he had amassed through his offices.<br>
<br>Fenton was knighted in 1589 during the deputyship of Sir William FitzWilliam. In the 1590s he was one of the most prominent and influential policy makers in the administration, serving as a commissioner for Ulster and Connaught and acting as surveyor of the queen's possessions, as well as serving on the Irish privy council. He was generally in line with the hardliners who favoured stern military action to sort out any opposition to English rule or rebellion, but he often stressed also that Ireland could not be properly governed without the consent of the natives, and was especially keen to promote the spread of the protestant faith, principally through preaching.<br>
<br>Early on in his career Fenton was an advocate of the Munster plantation, suggesting in 1583 that the English should occupy the rebels' land and the Irish be transported into the interior. He frequently complained that Ireland lacked the tools of judicial torture such as the rack and was quite prepared to use underhand methods to deal with troublesome Irish leaders. He advocated the assassination of various chieftains in the 1580s and 1590s, including Florence McCarthy Mor, leader of the McCarthy clan in Desmond (co. Kerry). When negotiations failed in 1597 and 1598 Fenton also suggested a similar end for Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, a plan which he frequently urged Robert Cecil to carry out in the late 1590s. He played a crucial role in the government campaign in the Nine Years' War, and the negotiations which brought it to an end. Elizabeth trusted Fenton to act as her official messenger and to convey letters to Tyrone.<br>
<br>Fenton was in danger of losing his exalted position with the accession of James. He had frequently expressed hostile attitudes towards the Scots in official communications, and had opposed using them to colonize Ulster, as others advocated. He was suspicious of James and warned Cecil that the Scottish king was really in league with Tyrone and Spain and so was helping to undermine stability in Ireland. When James acceded to the English throne Fenton asked Cecil to help preserve his position, but also sounded out the opinions of other leading courtiers, a move which may have undermined his relationship with Cecil. Fenton was obliged to share the office of secretary with Sir Richard Coke, a relationship that undoubtedly caused considerable tension, but he was confirmed in his position for life in 1604.<br>
<br>Fenton clashed with the new lord deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester, who held the post from 1605 to 1616, over the principles and progress of the Ulster plantation. Fenton argued that Chichester was excessively lenient in his actions and plans, mixing natives and colonists and granting too many pardons to rebels. Fenton's views seem to have held sway, and the plantation was established with a rigid separation of Scots and English settlers from Irish, Ulster being treated as a conquered country in need of control (although practice soon undermined theory).<br>
<br>Fenton died in Dublin on 19 October 1608, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral in the same tomb as his father-in-law.<br>
