<span class="headword">West,  Robert</span>  (<em>b. </em>1649, <em>d.</em> in or after 1712), <span class="occ">lawyer and conspirator</span>, was born in December 1649 and baptized on 30 December in Banbury, Oxfordshire, the eldest surviving son of James West (<i>bap</i>. 1614, <i>d</i>. 1684), mercer and rising townsman of Banbury, and his wife, Bridget Bentley (<i>bap</i>. 1616, <i>d</i>. 1696). On 1 December 1665, aged fifteen, he matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a demy until 1668. On 27 October that year he was admitted to Gray's Inn; he was called to the bar in 1674. At an unknown date he married Sarah, daughter of Thomas Cox.<br>
<br>The native of a proverbially puritan town West became keenly active in radical and dissenting politics. According to Bishop Gilbert Burnet he was &#145;a witty and active man, full of talk, and believed to be a determined atheist&#146;  (Burnet, 2.357). A member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script> he was probably the Robert West who signed the May 1679 whig petition presented to London's court of aldermen calling for a parliament and a redress of the nation's grievances. In March 1681, amid fears of popish plotting, he was questioned by the authorities for allegedly spreading the rumour that Holborn would be burned and that the streets would run with blood. On 15 June West transferred to the Middle Temple and in August he and fellow whig lawyer Aaron Smith were employed by the earl of Shaftesbury as counsel for the infamous &#145;Protestant Joiner&#146;, Stephen College, during his trial for treason at Oxford. In Oxford West lodged with John Locke at the home of the mathematician John Wallis. In November 1682, like so many radicals, West armed himself by having a sword made by a sword-cutler in Fleet Street.<br>
<br>West's political radicalism brought him into contact with many discontented protestant dissenters. In 1682, when East New Jersey was put up for auction, West along with eleven other men, headed by William Penn, purchased it for &pound;3400. West was the only non-Quaker. On 14 March 1683 the duke of York confirmed the sale of the province of East New Jersey to twenty-four proprietors. Unlike the original twelve, the twenty-four proprietors were an extremely mixed group. They included the Stuart loyalist and future Catholic convert James Drummond, earl of Perth, his brother John Drummond of Lundie and many other Scots, some of whom were Quakers, and some not. Most of the proprietors were artisans and traders. West was the only lawyer. Each proprietor originally received 10,000 acres. In July 1683, while under arrest for treason, West conveyed his property to Thomas Cox, who remained a close associate of West's and was sometimes designated &#145;trustee for West&#146;  (Pomfret, 249). Although West never visited the plantations in East New Jersey, his American connections along with his knowledge of proprietary affairs remained an important source of income for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1682 and 1683 West was deeply involved in the radical whig underground that was planning a general insurrection to overthrow the Stuart monarchy. He was part of a lower cabal of conspirators that included John Ayloffe, Nathaniel Wade, Colonel John Rumsey, Edward Norton, and Richard Goodenough among others. After the original ringleader of the discussions, Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, absconded to Holland in November 1682, West and Ayloffe told Nathaniel Wade that they felt abused by the great men for &#145;bringing us into discourses on things that should rather be done than talked of&#146;. At that point several members of the lower circle of plotters resolved to go to West's plantation in America, only to find the &#145;grant to Mr West and his partners not so large as we were informed&#146;; consequently &#145;we broke off from that design&#146;  (Wigfield, 153). In June 1683, shortly before the Rye House plot was exposed, West met Wade, Norton, Rumsey, Richard Walcot, James Holloway, and Richard Goodenough and his brother, Francis, at the Young Devils tavern within Temple Bar to plan an insurrection. They divided London and Westminster into twenty parts and calculated that they would need at least 4000 men. [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93794', "Rye House plotters")</script>]. He was arrested shortly after Josiah Keeling revealed the plot to authorities on 12 June. He readily gave evidence against his former friends, writing to the earl of Rochester on 22 June that he was resolved to &#145;unburden my soul to you or the Secretary or Council as I shall be required and to be ingenuous&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683</i>, 334). The duke of Ormond described &#145;West the lawyer&#146; to the earl of Arran as &#145;a man of quick wit and fluent tongue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 65). Along with Colonel John Rumsey, West turned king's evidence. During interrogations between 23 and 27 June he told a story of how London whigs had contrived two plans to prevent the accession of the Catholic duke of York and what they believed would be the consequent introduction of popery and arbitrary government. One plan was to raise a general insurrection throughout England and another was to assassinate the king and duke of York in their coaches at Rye House mill as they returned from Newmarket. West claimed that he told the others that since he was &#145;incapable of serving in their design&#146;, presumably as an assassin or soldier, he would &#145;undertake to buy some arms&hellip;on pretence of sending the same into America&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.391). West was also aware of whig efforts to engage Scottish dissidents gathered around the ninth earl of Argyll. West's main connections were with Robert Ferguson, John Wildman, Richard Goodenough, Richard Rumbold, Nathaniel Wade, Richard Nelthorp, and above all, Colonel Rumsey, who was the godfather of West's son. He claimed little contact with the so-called &#145;Protestant Lords&#146; concerned in the plotting, who, he understood from Ferguson, were the duke of Monmouth, William, Lord Russell, Lord Grey of Wark, and Lord Howard of Escrick. Burnet believed that Rumsey and West, who were &#145;perpetually together&#146;, forged the story of the Rye House assassination plan and that when they started contradicting each other Rumsey charged West &#145;with concealing some things&#146;. Thus West was &#145;laid in irons and was threatened with being hanged. For three days he would eat nothing, and seemed resolved to starve himself, but nature overcame his resolutions and then told all he knew and perhaps more than he knew&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.498, 503). It is true that Rumsey accused West of not revealing all that he knew and gave the authorities a list of questions to be put to West. But West confessed few new details, and his story remained similar to others told amid the interrogations and trials. His testimony, along with the testimony of Rumsey and Lord Howard, was later used to convict Captain Thomas Walcott, an associate of the earl of Shaftesbury, on 12 July, and Algernon Sidney, on 21 November, of treason for their participation in the plot. Both were executed. West was pardoned of all treasonable activity on 5 December 1684. He did not participate in either the Monmouth rebellion in 1685 or the revolution of 1688&#150;9. In 1692 he received a grant from the proprietors of East New Jersey for 960 acres &#145;out of a grateful sense of ye good services done to the concerns of ye said Province&#146;, particularly for aiding the proprietors in their defence of the right of government against the encroachments of the monarchy  (Whitehead, 176). West remained in contact with Thomas Cox and William Penn in the 1690s and early 1700s. He is briefly mentioned in a letter of 10 December 1700 from William Penn to his London agent, Charlwood Lawton. In May 1712 his name appears as one of the witnesses of William Penn's will along with that of Sarah West, who may have been West's wife. Penn's will, written in haste, seems to have been botched, probably because both Penn and West had suffered from recent strokes.<br>
