<span class="headword">Herbert,  Henry</span>, ninth earl of Pembroke and sixth earl of Montgomery  (<em>c.</em>1689&#150;1750), <span class="occ">architect and patron</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13050/', "Thomas Herbert, eighth earl of Pembroke and fifth earl of Montgomery (1656/7&#150;1733)")</script>, and his first wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1706), daughter of Sir Robert Sawyer of Highclere, Hampshire. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1705, at the time when the dean, Henry Aldrich, was working on his &#145;Elementa architecturae&#146; (printed <i>c</i>.1708), and the precociously Palladian Peckwater quadrangle was being built. On his grand tour in 1712 he visited Venice, Rome (where he met William Kent), and Naples (where he met Lord Shaftesbury). With the accession of George I he was appointed lord of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales and, as first lord of the bedchamber and from 1735 groom of the stole, he remained a close associate of George II after he became king.<br>
<br>Son of a famous antiquary and collector, Herbert shared these tastes but was most distinguished for his interest in architecture. This was acknowledged by Jonathan Swift, and George Vertue; according to Horace Walpole, &#145;no man had a purer taste in building&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.486), even if to a sour critic such as Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, Herbert's attention to architectural decorum was ridiculed as no more than a talent to &#145;imitate ill whatever was useless&#146;  (Scott Thomson, 54) in the buildings of Jones and Palladio. While still a bachelor, he built a house in Whitehall to the design of Colen Campbell. This was completed by 1724, when he began a long connection with that architect's junior associate Roger Morris. The connection is tantalizingly imprecise: Morris, whose own Palladian ideas were developing at this time, seems to have been content to act as the builder for an aristocrat who left few traces of professional involvement, although for one commission he demanded substantial payment for &#145;explanations of [Lord Herbert's] directions&#146; to the workmen involved  (BL, Add. MS. 61477, fol. 34). Architectural drawings by William Townsend for the Column of Victory at Blenheim Park, Oxfordshire, had to be submitted to Lord Herbert's examination in 1727. Horace Walpole recorded that the water tower on his father's estate at Houghton (<i>c</i>.1730) was designed by him. At this level, Herbert could be seen as typical of several dilettanti, but specific architectural details were left to his decision at Castle Hill, Devon (1729), and he played a part in the design of Wimbledon House, Surrey (1730&#150;33).<br>
<br>More significantly, Marble Hill, Twickenham, Middlesex (1724&#150;9), and Westcombe House, Blackheath, Kent (1727&#150;8), where Herbert was closely involved, mark important and widely imitated developments in the evolution of the English Palladian villa. Their fa&ccedil;ades are divided in three parts both horizontally and vertically; details of door and window proportions demonstrate the fastidious restraint which characterizes the English adoption of Palladian ideas; and their pyramidal roofs emphasize the handling of mass which makes these buildings more than mere two-dimensional patterns copied from engravings. At Marble Hill, Herbert acted the intermediary between the owner, Henrietta Howard, mistress of the prince of Wales, and Morris; at Westcombe he was himself patron. Their close partnership is also apparent at Wilton, Wiltshire where, after Herbert had succeeded his father as ninth earl in 1733, the Palladian bridge was built in the grounds of the house. George Vertue stated that it was &#145;the design of the present Earl and built by his direction&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 5.130), but other sources suggest that the design was Morris's. In 1734 this ten-year architectural collaboration was marked by the gift of a silver cup, bearing the head of Inigo Jones, to Morris from his patron.<br>
<br>Pembroke's most important architectural activity involved neither his own estates nor the houses of his friends, but a major transport artery, in London: here he acted not as architect, but as tireless promoter. Amid much pamphlet controversy, an act of parliament sanctioning the building of a bridge at Westminster was passed in 1738; Lord Pembroke laid the first stone in January 1739 and the last one (of the main structure) in 1747. The last of his 120 attendances at meetings of the bridge commissioners was on the morning of his death. He was the consistent supporter of the engineer Charles Labelye, whose original idea for construction by the use of caissons faced continuous opposition from other contestants for the arduous commission, as spiteful as they were inexpert. When a pier subsided in 1747, Pembroke was lampooned in <span class="italic">The Downfall of Westminster Bridge, or, My Lord in the Suds</span>. Besides architecture, Pembroke put more of his famed energy into litigation than into politics. At court, although a long-standing and close servant, he was not particularly intimate with the king; he gained little from attempts to mediate in the bitter disputes between George II and Frederick, prince of Wales. Despite a powerful role in the parliamentary constituency of Wilton, his participation in wider politics was slight. In the great family house, he promoted the cataloguing, under the supervision of Sir Andrew Fountaine, of the extensive collections built up by his father, and redecorated some of the rooms of the south front.<br>
<br>Lord Pembroke married Mary (1707&#150;1769), eldest daughter of Richard, Viscount Fitzwilliam, in August 1733; their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13034/', "Henry Herbert, later tenth earl of Pembroke and seventh earl of Montgomery")</script>, was born in July 1734. Constantly active, playing tennis daily and enjoying swimming, he is shown in the portrait bust by Roubiliac at Wilton to have been powerfully built and strong. But in the winter of 1743 he spent weeks at Bath and had experienced difficulty in breathing; Walpole mentions asthma in his detailed account of Pembroke's collapse and death on 9 January 1750 at Pembroke House, Privy Gardens, Whitehall. Another report suggests that the fatal seizure was occasioned by anger at disagreeable business at the bridge commission. Horace Walpole summed up Pembroke's contradictory character as &#145;public-spirited and inflexibly honest, though prejudice and passion were so predominant in him, that honesty had not fair play&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.108&#150;9); Queen Caroline felt &#145;he wishes well, but he is as odd as his father was, not so tractable, and full as mad&#146;  (Hervey, 3.828). He was buried on 16 January 1750 at Wilton.<br>
