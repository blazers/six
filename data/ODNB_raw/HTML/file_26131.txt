<span class="headword">Spencer <span class="st"> [Spenser; <em>alias </em>Tyrwhitt]</span>,  John</span>  (1600&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Jesuit and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Lincolnshire on 10 August 1600. On the basis of Spencer's alias, Foley and Gillow suggest that his mother may have been from the Tyrwhitt family of Ketilby. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1618 and during his time in Cambridge converted to the Roman Catholic church. He joined the Society of Jesus in Watten on 14 March 1626. From the noviciate he moved to Li&egrave;ge to study theology in either 1628 or 1629. He was ordained priest on 18 March 1632. He completed his final year of Jesuit formation, tertianship, in Ghent in 1634. From 1635 until either 1636 or 1637 he worked in Watten as prefect of the church, catechist, and missionary. In 1637 or 1638 he was sent to England to work in the residence of St Dominic (Lincolnshire). By 1641 he was back in Flanders as professor of moral theology or convener of discussions on controversial theology at Li&egrave;ge. He was professed of the four vows at Li&egrave;ge on 5 August 1641. Sent to Antwerp in 1644 he served there as procurator of the English province until late 1646 when he was transferred to Ghent. From that base he served as a military chaplain until 1655, when he returned to Antwerp as procurator. Between 1655 and 1658 when he reappeared at Antwerp, he is not listed in the official provincial catalogues, but from his involvement in a disputation with the Anglican divines Peter Gunning and John Pearson it is known that he spent some of that time in England.<br>
<br>Although Spencer had presided over controversial theological discussions at Li&egrave;ge in 1643 he published nothing in the field until <span class="italic">Scripture Mistaken</span> (Antwerp, 1655). It is possible that he returned to controversial theology because of proselytizing Anglicans during his years as Roman Catholic chaplain to the English forces in Flanders. Protestants, according to Spencer, conceded that they could not withstand Catholic arguments based on historical succession, tradition, patristics, and so on. But scripture, the word of God, was a more powerful weapon and it was firmly held in protestant hands. However, Spencer argued that protestants tortured scripture to support their arguments which, upon detailed examination, rested on nothing but errors, mistakes, and faulty translations. His work was intended to demonstrate the veracity of traditional Catholic teaching on justification by faith, good works, purgatory, and real presence. Henry Ferne replied with <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. Spencer's Book Intituled Scripture Mistaken</span> (London, 1660).<br>
<br>For reasons unknown Spencer revived an old debate in his second book, <span class="italic">Questions propounded for resolution of unlearned pretenders in matters of religion, to the doctors of the prelatical pretended reform'd church of England</span> (Paris, 1657). It was a reply to William Laud's <span class="italic">A Relation of the Conference</span> (2nd edn, London, 1639).<br>
<br>According to Charles Dodd (that is Hugh Tootell), Spencer &#145;was an able controvertist: and recommended himself to the world by a controversy, he and doctor [John] Lenthal[l] (formerly a Protestant divine of Cambridge) had with doctor Peter Gunning, and doctor John Pearson, anno 1657&#146;  (Dodd 3.312, col. 2). In May 1657 the four disputants argued &#145;Whether those of the Roman Church, or those of the English Protestant Church be Schismatiques&#146;. Through personal encounters or letters the debate continued until June 1658. At the start all promised that the discussions would be published only with the consent of all, but &#145;if either Party were guilty of a culpable neglect, or delay, in the prosecution of the business, the other Party should be at liberty to print&#146;  (J. Spencer, <span class="italic">Scisme Unmask't</span>, Paris, 1658). The account, thus named, accused Gunning of procrastination and negligence. Gunning's rejoinder, <span class="italic">A Contention for Truth</span> (London, 1658), appeared shortly thereafter. During the reign of James II extracts from <span class="italic">Scripture Mistaken</span> on the schismatic state of the Church of England were published separately.<br>
<br>From 1659 until 1667 Spencer was at the residence of St George (Worcestershire) and from 1659 until 2 August 1666 he was superior. In either 1668 or 1669 he moved to London. During his final illness he was taken into Grafton Manor, a house of the earl of Shrewsbury in the residence of St George, where he died on 17 January 1671.<br>
