<span class="headword">Watson,  James</span>  (1739/40?&#150;1790), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Dublin of unknown parentage and received his early training in the schools of the Dublin Society. He went to London as a young man, probably as a pupil to his fellow Irishman James Macardell. He became a very fine engraver in mezzotint, his plates delicate and carefully finished. He exhibited with the Society of Artists from 1762 until 1775, and during those two decades was regarded as a leading master. He was a fellow of the society and a director in 1770. After 1765 he inherited Macardell's role as principal engraver to Joshua Reynolds, and interpreted fifty-six of his paintings in sixty plates. His work included notable portraits of friends of Reynolds such as Edmund Burke and Samuel Johnson, as well as expensive, full-length society portraits. He also scraped many excellent mezzotints from pictures by Gainsborough, Cotes, Catherine Read, Van Dyck, Metsu, Schalken, Rubens, and others. Most early plates were published by major printsellers such as Ryland and Bryer, Bowles, Sayer, and Parker and Bakewell, but Watson began to publish some of his own work about 1762, at first from the Golden Head, in Craven Buildings, off Drury Lane. By 1766 he was at 45 Little Queen Anne Street, from which he moved in 1775 to no. 64. He had done well enough by 1778 to be living in semi-retirement. Among his last work was six plates for Boydell's <span class="italic">Houghton Gallery</span>. In a working life of thirty years he scraped 200 plates, the vast majority being portraits. Goodwin writes: &#145;these are notable achievements, brilliant in their lights, luminous in their shadows, delicate in the modelling of the flesh, rich in the draperies&#146;  (Goodwin, 73).<br>
<br>Watson's marriage to Mary (<i>b. c.</i>1740), daughter of Reuben Judkins, produced a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28830/', "Caroline Watson (1760/61&#150;1814)")</script>, who studied under her father and achieved fame in her own right, and a son, James Edmund Watson, who became a lawyer. Mary predeceased him; at the time of his death, probably in Fitzroy Street, London, on 20 or 22 May 1790, Watson was still paying interest on the sum of &pound;200 that he had borrowed from his sister-in-law Elizabeth Judkins; this loan was transferred to Caroline, the remainder of his estate being divided between his children. He was buried in St Marylebone cemetery.<br>
