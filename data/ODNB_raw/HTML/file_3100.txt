<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boycott <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Boycatt]</span>,  Charles Cunningham</span>  (1832&#150;1897), <span class="occ">land agent</span>, from whose surname the word &#145;boycott&#146; is derived, was born on 12 March 1832, the eldest surviving son of Revd William Boycatt (who changed his name to Boycott in 1862), rector of Wheatacre, Burgh St Peter, Norfolk, and Elizabeth Georgiana, daughter of Arthur Beevor. He was educated in Blackheath and Woolwich, and in 1850 was appointed ensign in the 39th regiment. After leaving the army in 1852 with the rank of captain, he farmed 500 acres near Loughmask, co. Mayo, in Ireland. In 1873 he became agent for Lord Erne, who owned 12,000 acres in co. Mayo.<br>
<br>In 1879 the Land League was formed to fight against tenant evictions and to discourage people from taking a farm from which a tenant had been evicted. In 1880 the Land League demanded a 25 per cent reduction in the rents paid by Lord Erne's tenants, and in September Boycott had to be placed under police protection following mob attacks.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Charles Stewart Parnell, in a speech at Ennis on 19 September 1880, advised tenants who could not obtain the reductions they demanded to take action against their landlord or his agent by &#145;isolating him from his kind as if he were a leper of old&#146;  (Hammond, 192&#150;3). Parnell was not the first to recommend this course of action: it had been used since the mid-century and by the Land League since 1879, when John Dillon urged that if any man took up land from which another had been evicted &#145;let no man speak to him or have any business transaction with him&#146;. But Parnell's speech encouraged Lord Erne's tenants to apply this treatment to Boycott.  (Kee, 211). Labourers refused to work for him, his walls were pulled down and his cattle scattered, he was unable to obtain provisions from the neighbourhood, and food had to be brought to him by steamer. He was hooted and spat on in the road, and only with great difficulty did he receive letters and telegrams.<br>
<br>Appeals to the government for assistance were at first made in vain, and on 18 October he sent a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> complaining of his treatment. A month later a party of fifty Ulstermen, chiefly from co. Cavan (afterwards known as &#145;emergency men&#146;), volunteered to harvest Boycott's crops, and they were given an escort of 900 soldiers. This was seen as a victory by the Land League, which was able to boast that thanks to its actions it had taken nearly 1000 men to gather in the produce of one farm. The number of evictions declined as a result. Once the harvest was completed, Boycott went to the United States. On his return to Ireland in the autumn of 1881 he was mobbed at an auction at Westport, and his effigy was hanged and burnt. He also received letters signed &#145;Rory of the Hills&#146;, threatening him with the fate of Lord Leitrim, who had recently been murdered. But things gradually improved and by 1883 were back to normal.<br>
<br>In 1886 Boycott left Ireland and became agent for Sir Hugh Adair's estates, in Suffolk. Boycott soon lived down his unpopularity and he even took his holidays in Ireland, but he was unable to obtain any compensation from the government. On 12 December 1888 he gave evidence before the special commission appointed to investigate the charges made by <span class="italic">The Times</span> against the Irish leaders, though he was not cross-examined.<br>
<br>The word &#145;boycott&#146; first came into use at the end of 1880. In the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> of 13 December it was printed in capitals. Joseph Gillis Biggar, MP for co. Cavan, was among those who used it to signify all intimidatory measures that stopped short of physical violence. It came into general use to describe measures used to isolate an institution or a country.<br>
<br>Boycott was a shortish man with a bald head, a heavy white moustache, and flowing white beard. In 1853 he married Annie, daughter of John Dunne. He died on 19 June 1897 at Priest's House, Flixton, Suffolk. He was survived by his wife.<br>
