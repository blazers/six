<span class="headword">Sinclair,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1656), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born in Scotland. The Swedish peerage notes him as the son of William Sinclair of Seba and his wife, Barbara Halcro, the daughter of Baron Hugo Halcro, although this could not be supported in the Scottish peerage (Scottish lairds were commonly called barons in seventeenth-century Sweden). David went to Sweden in 1630 or 1631 with his elder brother John and his father, and they all entered military service. John became a lieutenant-colonel in 1632 but died soon after at Thorn in Prussia.<br>
<br>David Sinclair appears to have begun his military career as an ensign in Colonel Robert Cunningham's regiment in 1633, but he also served in Andreas Dynn's recruited squadron that year. He may have been in William Gunn's recruited infantry squadron in 1636 but the following year he had returned to Cunningham's regiment, serving alongside his father. In 1638 Sinclair was a lieutenant in his father's regiment. There is no further reference to Sinclair in the Swedish military records for the next eleven years. From 1640 he was involved in the Scottish and later English civil wars. He was known as a staunch royalist in Swedish circles and used to bear the Stuart symbol of a white cockade. However, after the execution of Charles I Sinclair reappeared in Swedish service in Johan Wittkopf's cavalry regiment as an unspecified officer in 1649. He also served in Joakim Ernst Goertzke's cavalry regiment that year. David was soon promoted to lieutenant-colonel and then became the colonel of a foreign recruited cavalry regiment after 1650. Realizing the futility of the royalist cause, David used his father's money, which had been set aside for the family's return to Scotland, to buy property at Finnekumla in &Auml;lvsborg in Sweden. In 1651 he married Catherine Makel&eacute;er (<i>b</i>. 1637), the daughter of the Scottish merchant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63433/', "John Maclean (d. 1666)")</script>, who was based at G&ouml;teborg and had become a staunch royalist. They had three children, and one of them, William, later became Baron Sinclair. David Sinclair served as an interpreter for the Cromwellian ambassador Bulstrode Whitelocke on his 1654&#150;5 embassy to Sweden, and the political tendencies of his and his wife's families must have made for interesting conversations. According to the ambassador's diary, Sinclair went to great lengths to inform Whitelocke of the size and strength of G&ouml;teborg's fortifications, perhaps in an effort to reveal the power available to the Scottish royalists in Sweden. Sinclair's integration into Swedish society continued as he was ennobled and introduced to the Swedish house of nobility in 1655. He remained in military service on the Polish campaigns of Karl X and was fatally wounded by a cannon-ball while leading a charge at Warsaw in 1656. Although he died shortly afterwards his name was still listed as the colonel of a regiment in the Swedish military muster rolls until 1661.<br>
