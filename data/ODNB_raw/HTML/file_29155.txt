<span class="headword">Waymouth <span class="st"> [Weymouth]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1587&#150;1611), <span class="occ">navigator</span>, was the younger son of William Waymouth of Cockington, Devon. In 1587 George's grandfather, also William Waymouth, made his will: to his son he left a half-share of the ship <i>Lyon</i>, and to George the eventual possession of his chattels. The younger William Waymouth probably took part in the Newfoundland fishery in the 1570s, and from the 1580s was building ships, for which he received royal subsidies. From his father George Waymouth almost certainly learned the shipbuilder's trade and gained a knowledge of the north Atlantic. Then on 24 July 1601 he proposed to the East India Company a voyage to discover a north-west passage to the East. His proposal was accepted and on 2 May 1602, provisioned for eighteen months, bearing a letter from the queen to the emperor of China, and with the Revd John Cartwright, recently returned from Persia, as his mentor, he left London with the <i>Discovery</i> of 70 tons and the <i>Godspeed</i> of 60.<br>
<br>On 28 June Waymouth was off the American coast, in all likelihood Resolution Island. Coasting along the eastern shore of Baffin Island, he reckoned that he was almost in latitude 69 degrees north when during the night of 19&#150;20 July, their morale destroyed by days of fog and ice, the crews mutinied and, encouraged by Cartwright, persuaded Waymouth to turn back. On his way south he sailed 100 leagues into the Hudson Strait before bad weather drove him out again (26 July&#150;5 August). By mid-September London knew of his return to Dartmouth; a month later (13 October) the ships were in the Thames. He was examined by the privy council, his examination being relayed to the company on 25 October. His optimism regarding the likelihood of finding a passage led the company to sanction a second voyage, but the project was soon allowed to lapse, and by 1609 his log book of the voyage was in Amsterdam, where Hudson saw it before sailing on his last voyage.<br>
<br>In 1604 Waymouth twice presented the king with versions of his treatise <span class="italic">The Jewell of Artes</span>. In five sections of unequal length, he emphasized the explorer&#150;colonizer's need for a knowledge of navigational instruments, shipbuilding, machinery, gunnery, and fortification. This last incidentally assumed that colonists would live together in towns rather than scattered over the countryside. Doubtless the treatise was intended to justify Waymouth's employment on other voyages of exploration, and this goal it achieved. In 1605 he found sponsors from the worlds of commerce and colonization: Plymouth merchants interested in the cod fishery; Sir Thomas Arundell, who wished to establish an American colony for Roman Catholics; and possibly Arundell's brother-in-law the earl of Southampton. Waymouth's true destination was perhaps the region between Chesapeake Bay and Cape Cod, but, sailing from London in the <i>Archangell</i>, he took two months to reach the New England coast (5 March&#150;14 May). Pushed further north by bad weather, he was off Monhegan Island four days later. For a month he reconnoitred the Maine coast, and traded with the Abenaki Indians, five of whom he brought back with him. The return to Dartmouth took only a month (16 June&#150;18 July).<br>
<br>Once again Waymouth intended a sequel that was not to occur. On 30 October 1605 Sir John Zouche appointed him his second-in-command on a (possibly crypto-Catholic) colonizing venture that was to sail within six months, but during 1606 the voyage was superseded by the much larger expedition to the Chesapeake commanded by Christopher Newport. Nevertheless, Waymouth was not entirely passed over: he was probably the Captain Waiman said in August 1607 to have been &#145;taken &hellip; shipping himself to Spaine with intent as is thought to have betrayed his friends and shewed the Spaniards a meanes how to defeat this Virginian attempt&#146;  (Quinn and Quinn, 61). If Waiman was indeed Waymouth, he is more likely to have been a double agent helping to expose Spanish espionage, for on 27 October 1607, pending his further advancement, he received a royal pension of 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a day, and in March 1609 he joined a commission inquiring into Phineas Pett's building of the <i>Prince Royal</i>.<br>
<br>Alone among the commissioners Waymouth was the object of Pett's animosity, Pett terming him, <i>inter alia</i>, &#145;a great braggadocio, a vain and idle fellow&#146;, and alleging on one occasion that Waymouth was &#145;between drunk and sober&#146;. According to Pett, Waymouth had said that the <i>Prince Royal</i> &#145;was unfit for any use but a dung boat, with many other such false opprobrious defamations, wherein he was better practised than in any other profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography of Phineas Pett</span>, 38, 40). Pett's unsupported allegations of incompetence are unlikely to be true. Waymouth had studied mathematics &#145;these twenty years&#146; and &#145;during this time applied myself to know the several ways of building and the secrets of the best shipwrights in England and Christendom, and have likewise observed the several workings of ships in the sea in all the voyages I have been&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 309, fol. 68). He has been considered the author of an anonymous manuscript entitled &#145;A most excellent briefe and easie treatize&#146;  (Perrin, &#145;Introduction&#146;, in <span class="italic">Autobiography of Phineas Pett</span>, lxxiv), but recent scholarship regards this identification as questionable  (Lavery, 9).<br>
<br>Those who respected Waymouth included court figures such as Sir Walter Cope, the earl of Northampton, Sir Edward Cecil, and even Prince Henry. In 1610 Waymouth accompanied Cecil to the siege of Julich, later that year writing for the prince &#145;A Journall relation &hellip; of the taking &hellip; of Gulicke &hellip; with a platt of the town and castle as it is againe to be fortified&#146;  (BL, Royal MS 13. B. xxxiii). In 1611 Sir James Bond, a London merchant, commissioned from him a vessel of 40 tons in which he was to make a year-long voyage with twenty men. Whether or not she was built is unclear, but she may be the vessel that Pett alleged Waymouth had built and sailed to Antwerp in such circumstances that orders for his arrest as a pirate were given.<br>
<br>Waymouth's career is thus a mystery at its beginning and its end. There seems no reason to doubt that he was a knowledgeable mathematician, a skilled navigator, and a competent designer of ships and fortifications, but the stop&#150;start nature of his career at sea suggests that he lacked necessary qualities of leadership.<br>
