</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gwynne,  (Alban) Patrick</span>  (1913&#150;2003), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 24 March 1913 at Portsdown House, Portchester, Hampshire, the eldest of two children and the only son of Commander Alban Lewis Gwynne (1880&#150;1942), a naval officer based at the Portsmouth submarine school, and his wife, Ruby Muriel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bond (1888/9&#150;1942), the daughter of a cavalry officer who grew up in India. The family soon moved to Esher, Surrey, where they rented and then bought Homewood, a large Victorian house sited by the Portsmouth Road with 8 acres of land behind it. Here Gwynne's sister, Noreen Gwyneth (known as Babs), was born in 1915.<br>
<br>Gwynne spent a happy childhood and was educated at Sandroyd preparatory school (from 1921) and Harrow School, which he entered in 1927. Neither academic nor sporty, he took art as an extra subject to get out of cricket. He became skilled in sketching and measured drawing, and discovered the modern movement, whose work was then beginning to be covered by the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span>, for which he took out a subscription. Harrow ran sketching classes to the countryside, including one to Amersham, where he encountered Amyas Connell's pioneering modernist house High and Over (1928&#150;9). That &#145;sold me&#146;  (Bingham, interview) and convinced him that he should become an architect. He had initially agreed with his father's wish that he should train as a chartered accountant, but his father accepted his vocation and gained him a pupillage. From 1930 Gwynne served articles with John Coleridge, a former assistant of Sir Edwin Lutyens, whose architecture Gwynne later described as &#145;traditional but very decent&#146;  (ibid.). He divided his free time between designing houses and furniture, motoring, and being part of his sister's d&eacute;butante dance circuit. A keen motorist, Gwynne received a Wolseley Hornet as a twenty-first birthday present and drove through France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with an old school friend in 1934, visiting the modernist houses of Stuttgart's Weissenhof estate (1927), overseen by Mies van der Rohe, and Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye (1929), near Paris.<br>
<br>Having completed his pupillage Gwynne sought work with a modern practice&#151;placing an advert in the <span class="italic">Architects' Journal</span> without success. He was then introduced to Swedish friends of the Canadian architect Wells Coates, who held a party so that the two could meet. Coates initially offered Gwynne a job on a two-week trial basis, and this became two years, during which time he assisted in the detailing of Coates's Lawn Road flats, Hampstead, and Embassy Court flats, Hove. Here he also worked with Denys Lasdun and (George) Edric Neel (1914&#150;1952). Working independently he designed a house&#151;Shipwrights (1937) in Benfleet, Essex&#151;in which most of the accommodation was set on the first floor.<br>
<br>Gwynne's father's family were members of the Welsh landed gentry from whom he had inherited an estate in the seaside town of Aberaeron. This Commander Gwynne sold in 1936, and from the subsequent investments he put &pound;10,000 towards a new house at Esher, situated away from the increasingly noisy Portsmouth Road. Not wanting to leave their garden, Alban Gwynne and his wife agreed to Patrick's suggestion that he design a modern house set at the rear of the site. Gwynne talked to his parents daily about their requirements for the new residence, later explaining how &#145;they completely accepted the basic idea behind the house and its modern manner&#146;  (Bingham, interview).<br>
<br>Construction of The Homewood began in October 1937 and was complete seven months later. The result was an accomplished and striking work of modernism, raised on <i>pilotis</i> or stilts, and constructed from reinforced concrete. Though clearly influenced by the Villa Savoye, and one of the most confident statements of Le Corbusier's ideal in British domestic architecture, The Homewood also retains an English flavour, shaped by Coates, as well as&#151;in its large, single living space and use of rich materials&#151;by van der Rohe's Tugendhat House, Brno. Gwynne's Homewood was prominently featured in the <span class="italic">Architectural Review</span> (Sept 1939), but the family enjoyed only &#145;one good year&#146; there. In 1940 Patrick joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, and was sent in the following year to Canada, where he designed airstrips at Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and Goodridge, Ontario. Both of his parents died in 1942 and Gwynne and his sister returned to The Homewood alone. Babs married soon afterwards, while Patrick, rejecting work in public housing, set up his own architectural practice in the ground-floor wing of the house.<br>
<br>Gwynne's first post-war success came in 1950, when he was placed second (out of sixty-seven entries) in a competition for a restaurant for the Festival of Britain. It led to a commission for the Crescent Restaurant in the Festival Gardens, Battersea, for which he designed a regency-style tent, painted in different colours to last a second year, and managed by Forte Holdings. Gwynne went on to design further restaurants, including that at the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park for Charles Forte in 1963&#150;4. He was inspired by the sight of people walking with umbrellas in the park to create a design around a series of concrete hexagons supported on mushroom columns; the glazing was set back behind the columns, breaking down the building's bulk and giving an indeterminacy to its definition of indoors and outdoors. It was demolished in 1990 but a small version survives as the Serpentine restaurant, also in Hyde Park, and it led to a similar structure being adopted as the foyer of the York Theatre Royal (1967) after its director, Donald Bodley, had lunched in the park. The foyer includes top lighting to ensure that even by day it is possible to see inside the building from outside, while for evening performances it is totally illuminated. A further commission for Forte was Burtonwood service station (1974), two octagons with sweeping copper spires on the M62 motorway near Warrington. In 1954 Gwynne also designed London's first Japanese restaurant, finished using black lacquer, as well as numerous shops, none of which has survived.<br>
<br>Following the success of The Homewood, Gwynne came to specialize in private house design, mainly for a close network centred on his friends, the builder Leslie Bilsby, whom he had met through Wells Coates, and the quantity surveyor Kenneth Monk, with whom he worked on all his domestic designs. Gwynne's first house was the rebuilding of Bilsby's Victorian home in Blackheath, south London, in 1949. From the late 1950s his houses adopted strongly geometric shapes, usually with the garden frontage wider than that to the street, and the principal rooms gathered around a central top-lit stair. This was first seen at The Firs, Hampstead (1958), and two houses in Beechwood Close, all for German &eacute;migr&eacute;s who admired his mixture of modernism, dignified materials, and ability to incorporate the latest appliances. Many features included in these houses also appeared at The Homewood, including fitted furniture, simulated Japanese grass paper for the walls, and murals by Stefan Knapp and Peter Thompson. Gwynne's second house in Blackheath Park for Bilsby (1968&#150;9), described as &#145;a design which sets out to shock&#146;  (Pevsner, 276), comprises pentagonal rooms lined in black plastic with sliding red lacquer doors that could be thrown open for drinks parties. Such houses epitomized 1960s executive living at its most stylish and futuristic. Smaller versions appeared in a speculation of four houses for Monk at Coombe, Kingston upon Thames, and a seaside house for him at Angmering, Sussex (1970), where the food servery and drinks cabinet were given equal standing. A last house for Bilsby (1979) was a cluster of octagonal rooms, each with its own cone-shaped roof. Gwynne also had many friends in the worlds of music and theatre, for whom he built or converted houses, including the pianist Sir Clifford Curzon and the actors Laurence Harvey and Jack Hawkins. His largest house was Witley Park, at Brook, near Godalming, Surrey (1961&#150;3). Built for the department store owner Gerald Bentall, the design was of underlying hexagonal forms incorporated into an overall boomerang-shaped plan.<br>
<br>Gwynne had a strong independent streak and was willing to walk away from commissions if clients would not accept his advice. He took a fastidious and logical approach to the design process&#151;acknowledging a meticulous nature inherited from his mother&#151;and he could be self-critical and ruthless if he decided something was not right. In 1993&#150;4 he bequeathed The Homewood to the National Trust, though he continued to live and work there for the remainder of his life, advising on its restoration and refurnishing, maintaining his mischievous humour, and searching for perfection in design to the end. Patrick Gwynne died, unmarried, on 3 May 2003 of heart failure, at his home of more than sixty years; he was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the garden. Opened to the public by the National Trust in 2005, The Homewood is notable&#151;along with Ern&ouml; Goldfinger's 2 Willow Road, Hampstead&#151;as one of the few inter-war modern houses with fittings and grounds intact.<br>
