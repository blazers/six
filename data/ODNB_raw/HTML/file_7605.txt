<span class="headword">Dickinson,  James</span>  (1659&#150;1741), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was born in April 1659 at Lowmoor House in the parish of Dean, Cumberland, the son of Matthew Dickinson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1669) and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1666). Before his parents died&#151;his mother when he was about seven and his father when he was ten&#151;they taught him Quaker principles, but for a time he engaged in worldly pursuits before embracing Quakerism in 1678. A dealer in animal skins (and later a glover), he spent much of the rest of his life travelling on behalf of the Friends. He began with his witness to a presbyterian congregation at Tallentire, near Cockermouth, and a Baptist church at nearby Broughton, and after preaching in Westmorland, the Yorkshire dales, Durham, and Northumberland, in 1680&#150;81, he went in 1682 to Ireland, where he travelled with Thomas Wilson. He made his initial foray into Scotland in 1683 and then traversed Westmorland, Lancashire, the West Riding, Cheshire, and Wales, before returning to Ireland by 1685, this time with Thomas Trafford.<br>
<br>Dickinson made his first trip to southern England in 1686, going from Cornwall and Devon, where he was briefly arrested at Kirton, to Kent, London, Essex, and East Anglia. With Peter Fearon he went to the Netherlands, where they arrived safely after their vessel was chased by a Turkish ship. He journeyed throughout much of the country, engaging in a disputation in the Jewish synagogue at Amsterdam, and went as far as the German city of Emden. He returned again to Ireland, where he met John Burnyeat and was once again accompanied by Wilson. By 1688 he visited south-western England before going to London and York for the yearly meetings. As he criss-crossed England in 1689, he preached in Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Bristol with John Tiffin. In deciding where and when to travel, he followed what he believed to be the Holy Spirit's leading, as in 1690, when he &#145;had a Concern upon me to visit Friends in <i>Scotland</i>&#146;  (Dickinson, 44); on this trip he met Robert Barclay.<br>
<br>After a journey to the eastern counties in early 1691, Dickinson and Wilson voyaged to Barbados; they left on 9 July and escaped a French fleet <i>en route</i>, under cover of fog and darkness. In Barbados they participated in large meetings before sailing to New York, where they arrived on 23 November. On their American peregrination, which extended from Carolina to New England, their pacifist message enjoyed some success because the colonists were apprehensive of war. They sailed from Boston on 17 August 1692, and stopped at Barbados, Antigua, and Nevis, before reaching Britain on 15 April 1693. Dickinson was now engaged to a member of the Quaker meeting at Pardshaw, Cumberland, though they delayed marriage while he continued his itinerant preaching. On another visit to southern England, he had a confrontation at Reading with a follower of the Quaker schismatic John Story. Dickinson then went to Ireland again, where he &#145;travell'd hard, and had good Service&#146;  (Dickinson, 67&#150;8). He married in late 1694, though within weeks he was on his way to London where, following the queen's death, he walked through the streets exhorting the people to repent.<br>
<br>After further trips through northern and central England, Dickinson returned to America, landing in Virginia on 23 July 1696. While awaiting passage he had written <span class="italic">A Salutation of Love to the Seed of God</span> (18 February 1696), urging Friends to remain humble and feel divine power within them. In America he was accused of being a Jesuit, defended mainstream Quakerism against George Keith's disciples, and enjoyed some success witnessing to Welsh immigrants at Haverford. After leaving the colonies on 7 May 1697, he reached Plymouth on 22 June and briefly met with William Penn. During the ensuing years he not only continued to preach throughout much of England but twice returned to Ireland and Scotland (in 1698&#150;9 and 1701). With Wilson he sailed a third time to America, stopping on the way at Dublin and leaving there on 8 December 1713. After trekking up and down the seaboard, they departed on 17 February 1715 and reached Cork on 30 March. By the time Dickinson was back in Cumberland, he reckoned he had travelled 12,000 miles. In the spring of 1717 he apparently played a role in healing the long-standing breach among the Friends at Reading.<br>
<br>Periodically Dickinson pursued his trade: &#145;When I was at Liberty I laboured diligently in my outward Business, not only because of the Benefit I received there-from, but that I might be exemplary among my Neighbours&#146;  (Dickinson, 162). According to his fellow Friends he made a total of twelve trips to Ireland, the last of which, in 1727, took place during his campaign to persuade Friends in England and Ireland to compile a catalogue of Quaker sufferings; the eventual result was the collection published by Joseph Besse in 1753. Dickinson's wife died in 1726, and in the ensuing years his own health began to fail. About 1740 he and Jane Fearon related their narrow escape from murderers on a visit to Scotland, a tale published as <span class="italic">A Memorable Instance of Divine Guidance</span> (1793). Dickinson apparently suffered a stroke in 1740 that paralysed one side of his body and impaired his speech. Following his death at Moorside on 6 May 1741, he was interred on 8 May in the Quaker burial-ground at Eaglesfield, Cumberland.<br>
