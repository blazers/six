<span class="headword">Wanostrocht,  Nicholas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Nicholas Felix]</span>  (1804&#150;1876), <span class="occ">cricketer and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 5 October 1804 at Alfred House Academy, Peckham Road, Camberwell, the eldest son of Vincent Wanostrocht (1783&#150;1824). He was educated (<i>c</i>.1809&#150;<i>c</i>.1820) at the academy, which had been founded by his great-uncle.<br>
<br>The family, of Flemish origin, had come to England in the 1770s, when <a name="cosubject_28666"></a><span class="headword">Nicolas Wanostrocht</span>  (1745&#150;1812)<span class="occ"></span>, uncle of Vincent, was appointed tutor to the children of Henry Bathurst, second Earl Bathurst, at Cirencester Park. By 1795 he was financially able to found a school known as the Alfred House Academy in Camberwell, a location, according to the prospectus, &#145;very convenient on account of the coaches going to and from London every hour&#146;. He wrote a number of textbooks on French language, grammar, and syntax, mostly for children's use. With his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1820), he compiled <span class="italic">Le livre des enfans</span> (4th edn, 1808). The school itself was ahead of its time in encouraging the teaching of French rather than the classics and in its civilized approach to both discipline and leisure. Nicolas Wanostrocht, who printed the letters LLD after his name, died, probably at Alfred House, on 19 November 1812, aged sixty-three. He was buried at St Giles, Camberwell. After his death the school was continued by his nephew Vincent Wanostrocht, who as a child in 1789 had been allowed to leave France for England because of a pass signed by Robespierre. Besides revising his uncle's editions of the French classics, Vincent published in 1823 <span class="italic">The British Constitution, or, An Epitome of Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England</span>, which, although intended for school use, ran to 845 pages. Vincent Wanostrocht died in Camberwell on 25 January 1824.<br>
<br>Although only nineteen, Nicholas succeeded his father as headmaster of Alfred House. He was &#145;facetious, jostling, merry, lively and amusing&#146;, a character far removed from the notion of a schoolmaster of the time. This perhaps explains why &#145;the notch-making Felix&#146; played his cricket under a happy pseudonym with which he concealed his cricketing activities from the parents of his pupils. He gradually developed into a brilliant left-handed bat, with an effective cut to the off side from the shoulder. His slow &#145;lobs&#146; were described as fatal to batsmen. His first match at Lord's was suitably marked by the fact that he, a classical scholar, and one Pontifex took thirteen wickets between them. In 1831 he first played for the Gentlemen against the Players, and he continued to appear spasmodically in that fixture down to 1851. In 1832 Wanostrocht moved his school to Blackheath in Kent, and between 1831 and 1852 he made fifty-five appearances for the county, for which Alfred Mynn also played. The two &#145;chimed in together&#146; in friendship, although twice, in 1846, Mynn defeated Felix in single-wicket matches. In June 1846 he received the first benefit ever awarded to an amateur in a game &#145;in his honour&#146; at Lord's. Although he was not a member, the MCC initiated the game in the knowledge that he had not made much money as a schoolmaster but had given much pleasure as a player. Before &#145;an immense assemblage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>, 7 June 1846), including the prince consort, twenty-two of the best players available played a match hailed for its brilliance, although no record survives of how much money Felix received. His own eleven lost to that of Fuller Pilch, who admired Wanostrocht's left-handed batting as &#145;a beautiful thing to see&#146;.<br>
<br>The grace and fluency of Felix's batting were mirrored in his skill as an artist. Of some 200 works in pencil, pastel, or watercolour, many show his cricketing contemporaries, while his group portraiture created a harmonic unity in which each individual was allowed to be a solo performer in his own right. Thus the <i>All-England Eleven</i> of 1847 shows the elegance and authority of Mynn and Pilch, as pillars on either side of the picture, with Felix himself modestly in the second row. He also commissioned the rising young artist George Frederick Watts, who attended evening classes at his school, to produce a series of lithographs to illustrate batting techniques. Felix himself was the model and knew that, as a left-hander, the printed image in reverse would be particularly useful in instruction. They are the finest examples of cricketing art in the age before photography.<br>
<br>In 1845 Wanostrocht published <span class="italic">Felix on the bat; being a scientific enquiry into the use of the cricket bat, together with the history and use of the Catapulta</span>, which forms one of the classics of cricket. Although not the first instructional book, it was the first to give practical and illustrated advice. Felix's sense of humour was expressed in drawings showing what to do and what <i>not</i> to do. The lithographs illustrating particular strokes are attributed to Watts but it would be more correct to say that they are in his style and based on the work that he had done for Felix eight years earlier. It seems probable that those used in 1845 were modelled on drawings by Felix himself and John Gilbert. The Catapulta was the first bowling machine ever devised. The original idea for such a machine was Felix's, and once it had been developed a demonstration took place at Gravesend in 1845, with Pilch participating. It was intended both for practice and for coaching: Harrow School and the newly formed Surrey county club were the first purchasers. Felix was also responsible for some other important cricketing innovations. To protect batsmen in a time of uncertainty in bowling actions, as well as roughness in pitches, he designed batting gloves and leg-guards placed inside a player's trousers. He also devised a cap that was more suitable than the conventional top hat. None of his inventions, however, brought him much money as he was content to sell his patents modestly to others.<br>
<br>Wanostrocht began to suffer from rheumatism in the 1850s and gave up his school in 1854. He moved to Brighton and subsequently, in 1871, to Wimborne in Dorset. His first wife, Elizabeth Heale (<i>b</i>. 1806), whom he had married in 1825, died in 1863 and in the same year he married a widow, Catherine Bolls (1816&#150;1900). The last years of his life were marred by ill health, but consoled by a happy marriage, encouraged by occasional painting commissions, and supported by an annuity of &pound;50 from a capital sum raised through the endeavours of the Revd James Pycroft and Frederick Lillywhite. Wanostrocht died at his home, 1 Julian Villas, Wimborne, on 3 September 1876 and was buried in Wimborne parish church cemetery.<br>
