<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Britten,  James</span>  (1846&#150;1924), <span class="occ">botanist and Roman Catholic propagandist</span>, was born on 3 May 1846 at 18 Shawfield Street, Chelsea, London, the son of James Alexander Britten, bookseller, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Shepard). His father was a prominent active member of the local community, and Britten Street was named after him. Educated privately, by the age of ten Britten had become interested in plants, aided by Anne Pratt's <span class="italic">Flowering Plants of Great Britain</span> (1855). Intending a medical career he spent four years from 1846 onwards with a doctor at High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, but in 1869 abandoned medicine for botany and was appointed a junior assistant in the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where he was befriended and encouraged by Daniel Oliver. He had already (1863) contributed a note on plants found near Kew Bridge and while at Kew prepared an account of the <i>Crassulaceae</i> for Oliver's <span class="italic">Flora of Tropical Africa</span> (1871).<br>
<br>In 1871 Britten moved to the department of botany at the British Museum, where he worked until he retired in 1909. His interest in field botany led to publications on the plants of Buckinghamshire (especially those of High Wycombe) and other counties. Undoubtedly his major task, appreciated by amateur and professional botanists alike, was editing the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span> from 1879 until his death in 1924. This became the esteemed and convenient medium for the publication of records of British plants, descriptions of new species, obituaries, and articles on botanical bibliography (which particularly interested Britten&#151;a bookman in the broadest sense). Britten's editorial notes and reviews were entertaining, critical, and sometimes caustic. The management of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, with its ambition to absorb the department of botany, British Museum (Natural History), was a frequent target for witty attacks. Thiselton-Dyer considered one so libellous that he threatened a lawsuit, and to avoid this Britten agreed to make a large donation to a charity. He gave it to Richmond Hospital whose grateful governors, ignorant of the reason for his donation, made him a privileged life governor, to his lasting amusement.<br>
<br>Editing the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span> for forty-five years was only a part of Britten's activities. Between 1879 and 1891 he published in parts a well-illustrated pteridological work, <span class="italic">European Ferns</span>. <span class="italic">A Dictionary of English Plant Names</span> (in collaboration with Robert Holland, 1878&#150;81), and, in collaboration with George Simmonds Boulger, <span class="italic">A Biographical Index of British and Irish Botanists</span> (1891). He was also responsible for the publication of a reprint (1892) of Turner's <span class="italic">The Names of Herbes</span> (1549) and of <span class="italic">Illustrations of Australian plants collected in 1790 during Captain Cook's voyage &hellip; by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander</span> (1900&#150;05). His paper, &#145;Some early Cape botanists and collectors&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journal of Linnean Society&#150;Botany</span>,  (45, 1920, 29&#150;51) reveals his detailed knowledge of botanical history.<br>
<br>About 1867 Britten entered the Roman Catholic church and served it thereafter with ardour and industry; he was for some years honorary secretary of the Catholic Truth Society, wrote some of its polemical publications, and bequeathed most of his estate to Roman Catholic charities. Described as &#145;the most active Catholic layman&#146;  (Rendle, 340), he received the knighthood of St Gregory in 1897 and was promoted to knight commander in 1917. He died suddenly on 8 October 1924 in Bedford Street, London, and was buried at Isleworth cemetery, near his home in Brentford. He never married.<br>
<br>Britten had a ready wit and keen sense of humour, possessed a strong visual memory, held very firm views sometimes virulently expressed, and was appreciated for his scholarship and willingness to share his knowledge. The botanical names <i>Brittenia</i> Cogniaux (1890) and <i>Jamesbrittenia</i> O. Kuntze (1841) commemorate him.<br>
