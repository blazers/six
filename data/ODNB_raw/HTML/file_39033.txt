<span class="headword">Owen,  Owen</span>  (1847&#150;1910), <span class="occ">department store owner</span>, was born on 13 October 1847 at Cwmrhaeadr, near Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, Wales, the oldest child in the family of three sons and three daughters of Owen Owen (1818&#150;1872), tenant farmer, of Cwmrhaeadr, and his second wife, Esther Elizabeth (1814&#150;1855), daughter of William Evans, a Wesleyan Methodist minister. His father's first wife died in 1843, leaving two sons, one of whom, Thomas, was MP for Launceston from 1892 to 1898. His father married for a third time in 1857. Owen was educated at the Wesleyan college (later Queen's College), Taunton, and in 1860 went to Bath as an apprentice to his uncle, Samuel Evans, who had built up a large linen drapery business. His half-brother, Thomas, had been working there since 1853, and became his uncle's partner in 1863.<br>
<br>In 1868 Owen moved to Liverpool to set up his own drapery business, hoping to attract the large Welsh population in Liverpool, and leased premises in London Road. He concentrated on rapid turnover and low profit margins, and expansion was so rapid that by 1873 he had over 120 employees and a quarter of an acre of floor space. He insisted on a high standard of service, and in the early days he himself greeted the customers as they entered the store. In 1881 his youngest brother Jabez entered into a partnership with him, which lasted until the former's fatal illness in 1885. Owen soon began to acquire neighbouring properties, and in the 1880s knocked many of them down in order to build hostels for his staff, who were mostly from Wales. He saw his staff as an extended family, and later, when he bought an estate in Wales, he invited many of them there for weekends, and even paid for some of them to go abroad for the sake of their health. Owen was one of the first big shopkeepers to introduce a weekly half-holiday for his employees, and he also set up the Owen Owen Trust in 1900 to help retired members of staff.<br>
<br>Unlike most other early department store owners, such as David Lewis, also in Liverpool, Owen Owen was not interested in extending the range of goods sold, and although the store had many departments, it remained a drapery business, with dress and curtain materials at the centre of the business. His clientele now came from as far away as north Wales, with people prepared to travel long distances for the good quality merchandise at low prices. Owen was similarly not interested in opening new stores in other cities, and in the 1880s he began instead to invest his profits in other enterprises, notably in North American railways. He helped other members of his family to establish their own businesses, including the drapery businesses started by his brother William in the 1870s, and his brother-in-law R. O. Davies in the 1880s, in Bayswater, London, and in 1889 he became a director of Evans and Owen Ltd in Bath.<br>
<br>On 19 December 1891 Owen married a shop assistant at Gorringe's store in London, Ellen Maria (<i>b</i>. 1858/9), daughter of George Richards, an innkeeper, of Southsea, Hampshire. They had two sons and two daughters. Owen moved to London, but continued to supervise the Liverpool store, which had become a limited company in 1899. It continued to grow, and by 1906 shares in Owen Owen were paying a 16 per cent dividend. The store was now one of the largest in the north. In 1906 Owen went on a fact-finding visit to the United States to investigate American department stores, and he was particularly impressed by the bargain basements and by the advertising: &#145;Americans don't have sales, they have advertising campaigns&#146;  (<span class="italic">Draper's Record</span>, 21 June 1906), he reported.<br>
<br>From the 1890s onwards, however, Owen became involved mainly in property transactions in London. In 1892 he bought a building in Kensington High Street, which he developed, and sold to Derry and Tom's in 1896 at a profit of &pound;9000. Other developments included Gwydir Chambers in High Holborn (1900&#150;03), and the Dollis Hill housing estate in north-west London, built on 22 acres of open land which he bought in 1903. In 1909 he formed his own property company, Owen Owen estates. Owen also continued to invest in other drapery businesses and department stores. In 1892 he made a substantial investment in the Bon March&eacute; store in Brixton, which was in financial difficulties, and in 1897 he began to buy shares in John Barnes &amp; Co. in the Finchley Road. He became a director of both of these.<br>
<br>Brought up in a Wesleyan Methodist family, Owen became a Unitarian in the 1880s. He was a Liberal, a supporter of W. E. Gladstone and home rule, and a friend of D. Lloyd George, whom he first met at Grasgarth, in Acton, the home of his brother-in-law R. O. Davies. Throughout his life he supported Welsh causes, particularly education and the arts. He was an influential member of the Welsh National Society of Liverpool, and was later at the centre of London Welsh society. He made generous donations to the national eisteddfod of Wales (which was held in Liverpool in 1884), and the North Wales College, and became a governor of the University College of North Wales at Bangor. He was a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion from 1886. He also made donations to the Liverpool University fund from 1902, and took a great interest in the Warehousemen, Clerks, and Drapers' schools at Purley, Surrey. He was involved in setting up the Linen and Woollen Drapers' cottage homes at Mill Hill for retired retail trade workers in 1897. An enthusiastic cyclist, who moved from the tricycle to the bicycle after a course of lessons in 1897, and a tennis player, Owen bought his first motor car in 1907, and travelled in it to and from the estate at Tan-y-Foel, Penmaen-mawr, in Caernarvonshire, which he had bought in 1902. He also bought the Garthgwynion estate, near Machynlleth, in 1906; this included Bwlch, his ancestral home, which his father had had to sell in 1841. He was a JP for Caernarvonshire. <br>
<br>Owen Owen died of cancer, after an operation, on 27 March 1910, at his London home, the Manor House, 37 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 30 March 1910, and his ashes were scattered on the family grave in the Machynlleth nonconformist cemetery. His wife survived him. In the years following his death the Owen Owen store in Liverpool ran into difficulties, but in 1925 his son-in-law, Duncan Norman, took it over, built a new store, and revived its fortunes by appealing to a more fashionable market.<br>
