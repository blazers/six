<span class="headword">Atkinson,  William</span>  (1774/5&#150;1839), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Bishop Auckland, co. Durham; he was probably the son of a William Atkinson who worked during the 1760s as a builder at nearby Auckland Castle, the palace of the bishops of Durham. The younger William began as a carpenter and in the mid-1790s came to the attention of the prominent architect James Wyatt, then making alterations to the castle, who took him, with Bishop Barrington's support, as a pupil into his London office. In July 1796 Atkinson, aged twenty-two, entered the Royal Academy Schools and in 1797 he won the gold medal for his designs for a court of justice. He was until 1811 an occasional exhibitor at the academy.<br>
<br>In 1805 Atkinson published, in the villa book genre, <span class="italic">Views of Picturesque Cottages</span>, comprising asymmetrical elevations to complement picturesque landscapes, and irregular plans arising from utilitarian needs. His observations of Tudor Gothic on which the plates, among the earliest of their kind to be published, were based did not seriously suggest revivalism, representing rather the loss of playful eighteenth-century eclecticism before the onset of the archaeologically more rigorous Gothic revival. That want of sensitivity characterized much of Atkinson's architecture, of which by far the major part comprised country houses.<br>
<br>Atkinson's career as an independent architect began about 1800. His almost fifty commissions were broadly distributed in the north of England and the Scottish lowlands, and London and the surrounding counties, with occasional excursions to Herefordshire, Staffordshire, and Ireland. In 1812&#150;16 he had an office in Manchester, where, of the seven churches, including Durham Cathedral, on which he worked countrywide, All Saints', Newton Heath (1814&#150;16), was the only one wholly rebuilt to his designs. Between 1804 and 1834 some twelve country houses were built or remodelled to his designs in the Gothic or castle style. His gothicization of Chequers, Buckinghamshire (1823), was considered exquisite by Sir Alexander Croke  (Major, 48). Of four houses in Scotland, as well as his Gothic reconstruction (1803&#150;12) of Scone Palace for the third earl of Mansfield, Abbotsford (1816&#150;23) for Sir Walter Scott was notable, with contributions in the old Scottish style to what remains Atkinson's design, from the architect Edward Blore and others (including Scott himself) and other contributions, in the invention of detail, from the workers. Atkinson seems never to have executed entire classical buildings, in which style, of only about six examples, his work consisted before 1825 of additions or alterations to country houses, such as Bretton Hall (1807) and Broughton Hall (1809&#150;11), both in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Gorhambury, Hertfordshire (1816&#150;17), and Hylands, Essex (1819&#150;25). The handful of public buildings to which Atkinson made minor modifications, mostly associated with his post as architect to the Board of Ordnance after 1813, were all in the capital, and included the Ordnance office (dem.) in Pall Mall, the Tower of London, and Woolwich arsenal. Also in London, his work on town houses included the addition in 1819&#150;20 of the Flemish picture gallery to Thomas Hope's house in Duchess Street, Portland Place, to the designs of Hope, for whom Atkinson had recently remodelled his country seat, Deepdene, in Surrey.<br>
<br>Besides architecture, Atkinson's great interests were chemistry, geology, and particularly botany. He combined the first two when, about 1810, he successfully introduced to the London market a Roman cement, known as &#145;Atkinson's cement&#146;, rivalling other recently patented types of stucco and mastic, used either externally or internally as stucco or rendering. Its significant ingredient, lime-bearing calcareous clay, he extracted from land in north Yorkshire belonging to the first earl of Mulgrave, for whom he had recently remodelled Mulgrave Castle, near Whitby; he then shipped the clay to Westminster, where he owned a wharf. Lord Mulgrave, at that time master-general of the ordnance, was instrumental in Atkinson's succeeding James Wyatt, on 1 October 1813, after the latter's sudden death on 4 September, as architect to the Board of Ordnance, a post he retained until his department was abolished on 1 January 1829.<br>
<br>Atkinson was a most able architect, sound in both theory and practice and sometimes, as his Regency interiors at Broughton show, outstanding. He was also a successful businessman. In the opinion of the Architectural Publication Society's dictionary in 1852 &#145;he particularly excelled in alterations to existing edifices&#146;  (Papworth, 1.119). He attracted numerous pupils, including Thomas Allason, Robert R. Banks, Peter Hubert Desvignes, Matthew Habershorn, John Burgess Watson, and his nephew Thomas Tredgold. Of his two sons, William and Henry George Atkinson, the younger also became an architect.<br>
<br>Atkinson indulged his passion for horticulture by often planting rare species, for example in the gardens of the villa which he built for himself about 1818 at Grove End in Paddington and, later, in the 170 acre estate he purchased about 1830 at Silvermere, near Cobham, Surrey, where he also built himself a house. It was here that he died on 22 May 1839, aged sixty-six. He was buried at nearby Walton-on-Thames.<br>
