<span class="headword">Dick,  John</span>  (1764&#150;1833), <span class="occ">United Secession minister and theological writer</span>, was born on 10 October 1764 in Aberdeen, the son of the Revd Alexander Dick, minister of the associate congregation of the Seceder church there, and his wife, Helen Tolmie, who was regarded as a woman of intellect and piety, and the daughter of a Captain Tolmie of Aberdeen. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and King's College, Aberdeen. He was accepted as a student for the ministry by the Secession church, studied under the famed John Brown of Haddington, and in 1785 was licensed as a probationer. In the same year he accepted a call from the congregation of Slateford, near Edinburgh, and was ordained there. On 8 August 1789, at Colinton, Edinburghshire, he married Jane or Jeanie, daughter of the Revd G. Coventry, of Stichill, Roxburghshire, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6473/', "Andrew Coventry")</script>, professor of agriculture in the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>After a successful ministry in Slateford, in 1801 Dick accepted a call to the congregation of Shuttle Street, Glasgow (known as Greyfriars from 1821), and he remained minister there until his death. This congregation was one of the oldest and wealthiest of the Secession congregations. Dick's sermons were regarded as models of clarity, conciseness, and simplicity of style. In 1815, he was awarded the degree of DD by Princeton College, USA. In 1820 he was appointed professor of theology to the Associate Synod of the newly formed United Secession church. At first only students belonging to his own synod attended, but his ability and tact soon ensured that those from the other Secession synod (the General Associate Synod) attended also.<br>
<br>In 1788 Dick played a prominent part in the attack mounted by several leading figures in the Secession church on the doctrines of the Revd William McGill of Ayr, who was regarded by many as having espoused Socinian views. When the established church failed effectively to prosecute McGill for heresy, Dick published a sermon entitled <span class="italic">The Conduct and Doom of False Teachers</span> (1788) and almost certainly was involved in several other contributions to the attack. During the 1790s he joined the debate in the Secession church over adherence to the Westminster confession of faith, especially regarding its doctrine on the relationship of church and state. His sermon, preached at the opening of synod in October 1796, was published as <span class="italic">Confessions of faith shown to be necessary, and the duty of churches with respect to them explained</span> (1796), and led to a heated pamphlet war with some of those who were of the &#145;old light&#146; party in the church and who were opposed to Dick's position. In his sermon, which was argued in a calm and candid spirit, Dick vindicated the use of confessions but supported frequent revision of them and tolerance of minor disagreements. He was also a strong supporter of the foreign missionary movement, then in its infancy.<br>
<br>Dick's reputation as a theological writer was established in his <span class="italic">Essay on the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments</span> (Edinburgh, 1800). This work, which derived from the dispute in the Secession church over continuing adherence to the Scottish covenants, advocated the doctrine of plenary inspiration; that is, that all parts of scripture, including both words and ideas, were written under the movement, direction, and assistance of the Holy Spirit. Dick accepted, however, varying kinds or degrees of inspiration depending on the subject matter or previous states of minds of the authors. His strong commitment to the principles of plenary inspiration explains his being chosen president of the Glasgow auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society at the height of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> controversy, which arose largely over Scottish opposition to the society's preparedness to publish bibles containing the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> for distribution on the continent.<br>
<br>Dick's most influential work, published posthumously by his son, Andrew Coventry Dick, was his four-volume <span class="italic">Lectures on Theology</span> (1834). This work was reprinted frequently and was also widely used in the Presbyterian churches in the USA. The work commences with fifteen lectures dealing with subjects such as Christian evidences and the doctrine of scripture, before moving on to cover the attributes of God, the Trinity, the divine decrees of creation, providence, and the fall of man and their execution, the covenant of grace, the mediator, the application of redemption, eschatology, and ecclesiology. The section on the mediator is particularly extensive, though it follows the traditional divisions of prophet, priest, and king. The subject of the means of grace receives extended attention, and the ten commandments are considered in the concluding lectures. While Dick held a high position on the doctrine of inspiration, and while as a result his confidence in revelation was absolute and allowed no trust in reason as a guide in religion, outside the area of revelation he was fearless in applying the test of reason to argue for what he termed &#145;natural theology&#146;. By this he meant &#145;the knowledge of God which the light of nature teaches, or which is acquired by our unassisted powers, by the exercise of reason, and the suggestions of conscience&#146;. He was careful to limit this, however, to inferring the existence of an invisible creator, and not to innate ideas of God. The leading Reformed theologians in America were well aware of this work and Archibald Alexander, president of Princeton College, rated it as the best systematic theology available in English.<br>
<br>Dick continued actively in the ministry until his death, which occurred suddenly in Glasgow on 25 January 1833.<br>
