<span class="headword">Lynn,  Samuel Ferris</span>  (1836&#150;1876), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Fethard, co. Wexford, the son of Henry Johnston Lynn, lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Margaretta Ferris. He studied modelling at the Belfast School of Design, and architecture with his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63609/', "William Henry Lynn")</script>, who established a highly successful architectural practice. He moved to London in 1854 and enrolled as a pupil at the Royal Academy Schools, where he achieved early success as an exhibitor, being awarded a silver medal in 1857 for a model from life and a gold medal in 1859 for the best historical composition, <span class="italic">Lycoan Imploring Achilles to Spare his Life</span>. His group <span class="italic">Procris and Cephalus</span> won for him the academy's travelling studentship. He remained a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy throughout his life, while he participated in the Royal Hibernian Academy exhibitions in Dublin on only four occasions. His first exhibited work in Dublin (1864) was a subject piece, <span class="italic">Evangeline</span> (plaster), previously exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1858 and at the International Exhibition in London in 1862. This sad and reflective figure, representing the heroine of Longfellow's poem of the same title, was illustrated and discussed in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in 1865. Lynn lived most of his working life in London, where he was engaged in the early 1860s as assistant to Patrick MacDowell and later to John Henry Foley, both of whom were also Irish sculptors and whose influence remains evident in his work. His wide range of expression in his ideal works, from the violent and vigorous to the gentle and sensitive, echoes the range of MacDowell. Foley was engaged on work for the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens when Lynn was working in his studio and his portrait style reveals itself in Lynn's monumental portrait work.<br>
<br>Like most Victorian sculptors, Lynn executed a considerable number of imaginative works while making his career as a portrait sculptor. Among his monumental portrait sculptures, most of which are in Northern Ireland, the marble statue of Lord Farnham in Cavan, co. Cavan, executed in 1871, was described in the <span class="italic">Irish Builder</span> as &#145;evincing great artistic learning, diligent study and marked ability&#146;. Farnham is shown in the robes of the Order of St Patrick. Shortly before this work Lynn received the commission to execute the statue of Prince Albert for W. J. Barre's Albert memorial clock tower in Belfast, completed in 1869. Surely influenced by Foley's many statues of the prince, Lynn's portrait, executed in Portland stone, was described as &#145;noble and commanding&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 5 Feb 1870, 153). In 1873 his bronze statue of the marquess of Downshire, less formally grand and more casual in appearance, was unveiled on his estate at Hillsborough, co. Down. A further statue in Belfast (and one of Lynn's last works), commemorating the Revd Dr Henry Cooke, erected in College Square in 1876, replaced a statue of the earl of Belfast by Patrick MacDowell which was removed indoors. The MacDowell statue, executed in bronze, had been labelled &#145;the Black Man&#146;, a name which transferred to the bronze Lynn portrait. A tomb monument by Lynn commemorating Joseph Makesy (1868), taking the form of an angel uncovering a medallion portrait of the deceased, is in Waterford Cathedral. Lynn was also engaged to carry out architectural sculpture, examples of which are at the Lancashire Insurance office in Manchester (1861) and the Provincial Bank (now the Allied Irish Bank) in College Street, Dublin (1864). The pediment of the bank building shows a representation of Commerce and Agriculture by Lynn.<br>
<br>Lynn had a short but full career; he died on 5 April 1876, at the age of forty, at his home in Crumlin Terrace, Belfast. While he failed to be elected to the Royal Academy in his lifetime, he did become a member of the Institute of Sculptors in London in 1861 and was elected an associate of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1872. On the presentation of two of Lynn's statuettes to the Belfast Municipal Art Gallery in 1907, Thomas Drew, president of the Royal Hibernian Academy, described &#145;the grace of pose and dignity&#146; in his monumental sculpture and drew attention to his mastery of drapery  (<span class="italic">Belfast Municipal Art Gallery and Museum Quarterly</span>, 6). His obituary describes a &#145;man whom to know was to love; a kinder and better friend it was impossible to meet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, 7 April 1876). This is further supported by the words of a contemporary and friend, Dr Kyle Knox, who wrote about Lynn in 1916 on the occasion of a joint exhibition of the works of the Lynn brothers in the Belfast Municipal Art Gallery. Knox described a &#145;bright, happy and pleasant companion, &hellip; always ready for jokes&#146;  (Knox, 11).<br>
