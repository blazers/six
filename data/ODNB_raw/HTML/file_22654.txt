<span class="headword">Powell,  Joseph</span>  (1780&#150;1834), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and printmaker</span>, may possibly have been a son of the Joseph Powell and Mary March who married at St Marylebone in September 1776, and it is likely that he had family connections with Herefordshire and Worcestershire. He often painted there, and his sketchbook in the Victoria and Albert Museum is signed &#145;J. Powell, Salop, Bridgnorth&#146;. Despite having been Powell's pupil, Samuel Redgrave misnamed him John in his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Artists</span> and confused him with an enamel painter, J. Powell. The incorrect forename was repeated in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. When Powell first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1796 and 1797, he was living in the Lambeth house of Benjamin Thomas Pouncy (<i>d</i>. 1799), the engraver and topographer, whose pupil he probably was. He was also connected with the watercolour painter Michael &#145;Angelo&#146; Rooker, publishing an engraving after Rooker's drawing of Netley Abbey in 1800. He also etched after such old masters as Domenichino, Salvator Rosa, and Gaspar Poussin, and about 1810 made a series of soft-ground etchings of Egyptian scenes. There is, however, no other intimation that he ever travelled abroad. It is likely that some of his oil paintings and watercolours have been credited to more prestigious names, but his known watercolours are often both impressive and poetic. He was a very accomplished sketcher. By 1800 Powell had moved to Old Cavendish Street, and after living in John Street and Great Poland Street in 1819 he settled at 14 Allsop's Buildings, between Baker Street and Regent's Park. This remained his London address. Family tradition had it that a quarrel with William Turner of Oxford led to Powell's being blackballed at the Society of Painters in Water Colours. There is no record of this in the Old Watercolour Society's archives, but he aspired to membership of the Associated Artists (1808&#150;11) and was the first president of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours set up in 1831 to combat what he and his fellows regarded as the selfish monopoly of the older body. He exhibited with them until 1834, and appears to have died towards the end of that year. His wife's first name was Harriet, and their eight children were baptized at St Marylebone. They were Charlotte Harriet (<i>bap</i>. 1820), Richard Foulkefs [<i>sic</i>] (1822), Joseph Rubens (1823&#150;1896), Emma Roslin (1825), Clara (1827), Louisa Caroline (1828), Agnes (1830), and Adelaide (1832). Joseph Rubens Powell studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 1844, exhibited precociously from 1835 to 1871, and worked for the most part in oil. He died at Canterbury on 26 January 1896, leaving his effects to his spinster daughters and son John Christopher Powell, a machine manufacturer. The British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London, Brighton Art Gallery, and Manchester City Galleries hold examples of Joseph Powell's work.<br>
