<span class="headword">Clift,  William</span>  (1775&#150;1849), <span class="occ">museum curator and scientific illustrator</span>, was born at Burcombe, near Bodmin, Cornwall, on 14 February 1775, and was baptized (as William Cleft) in the Bodmin parish church on 12 April that year. He was the youngest of the seven children (Elizabeth, Joanna, Robert, Thomas, John, one of unknown name, and William) of Robert Clift (1720&#150;1784), a miller, whose death left his wife, Joanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coutts (<i>bap</i>. 1733), a seamstress, and family in poverty. Clift was sent to school at Bodmin, and his abilities at illustration drew the attention of Walter Raleigh Gilbert of The Priory, Bodmin (one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to George III), and his wife, Nancy Hosken, &#145;a lady of great accomplishments&#146;. Mrs Gilbert had been a schoolfellow of Anne Home, who married the celebrated surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14220/', "John Hunter (1728&#150;1793)")</script> in 1771. Mrs Gilbert recommended Clift as an apprentice to Hunter to replace his former anatomical assistant, William Bell, emphasizing his abilities as an artist. Clift arrived in London on 14 February 1792, and was accepted by Hunter as his apprentice for a six-year period without the payment of the standard apprenticeship fee, on the understanding that he was to make drawings, copy dictation, and assist in the care of the anatomical museum which Hunter had created on the property between his two residences on Castle Street and Leicester Square.<br>
<br>While Hunter lived this arrangement proved satisfactory to both of them: Clift assisted Hunter with his dissections and wrote from his dictation from early morning until late at night. Hunter's sudden death on 16 October 1793 passed his two residences to his wife, Anne, and his son John and daughter Agnes. His massive collection of 18,682 anatomical preparations was willed to his brother-in-law Everard Home and assistant, Matthew Baillie, with instructions to offer it for sale to parliament. Wartime economies made parliament reluctant to purchase it, however, and during negotiations for sale Clift was engaged during 1793&#150;9 by Hunter's executors to watch over the collections, living with an old housekeeper in Hunter's residence on Castle Street; for this he received a meagre income. He was solely responsible for the safety and preservation of the collection, and guarded it with zeal. Fearing for its safety Clift copied out for private keeping nearly half of Hunter's unpublished manuscripts (thus saving this material from Home's intentional destruction of the main body of the original manuscripts in 1823). Clift was a tireless curator and when parliament agreed to purchase the collection in 1799 it was reported to be in a better state than at its owner's death. The Company of Surgeons, incorporated in 1800 as the College of Surgeons of England, was asked by parliament in 1799 to assume the charge of the collection, to which it agreed in December that year.<br>
<br>One of the first acts of the trustees of the new college was to retain Clift's services, dignifying him with the title of conservator of the Hunterian Museum at a salary of &pound;80 per annum. From that date his time and talents were devoted to the collection. Under his supervision Hunter's collections were twice moved without damage, first in 1806 from their Castle Street location to a temporary warehouse on Lincoln's Inn Fields, where they remained until 1813 while the original College of Surgeons buildings were constructed, and again during the rebuilding of the museum and college in 1834&#150;7. Clift was a scrupulous record-keeper and his surviving diaries covering the years 1811 to 1842 supply a detailed insight into the workings of the College of Surgeons, the Hunterian Museum, and London scientific life generally. He lived to see the museum enriched and enlarged to become the foremost museum of comparative anatomy in the world. On 21 January 1801 Clift married Caroline Harriet Pope (1775&#150;1849) at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. His only son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58060/', "William Home Clift (1803&#150;1832)")</script>, a fine illustrator whom Clift was preparing as his successor, died on 17 September 1832 from injuries sustained in a carriage accident. His only daughter, Caroline Amelia Clift, was born in September 1801 (<i>bap</i>. 10 January 1802) and died on 7 May 1873. She married Clift's assistant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21026/', "Richard Owen (1804&#150;1892)")</script> at St Pancras New Church on 20 July 1835; their only child, William (1837&#150;1886), left one son, Richard Startin Owen.<br>
<br>Clift's dedication to science and his reputation for care and thoroughness gave him a standing in the scientific community that went beyond his limited scientific publications. He was praised by the surgeon John Flint South, Sir Benjamin Brodie the elder (1783&#150;1862), Sir Joseph Banks, William Wollaston, and Humphry Davy, and through the influence of the latter was elected FRS on 8 May 1823. He was also a member of the Society for Animal Chemistry, a small London scientific association created as an assistant society of the Royal Society of London in 1809, and drawn from members of the Royal Institution and the College of Surgeons. This group was dedicated to the study of physiology and animal chemistry, communicating results through publications in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>. It died out in 1825.<br>
<br>Clift was also interested in palaeontology and geology and was a fellow of the Geological Society. His knowledge of palaeontological and geological issues was acknowledged by Gideon Mantell, Georges Cuvier, and Charles Lyell. Clift's skills as an anatomical illustrator were early displayed in print in Matthew Baillie's <span class="italic">A series of engravings &hellip; to illustrate the morbid anatomy of some of the most important parts of the human body</span> (1799&#150;1803), for which he was the unnamed illustrator. Similarly, many of the 320 illustrations in Home's 100 papers on anatomical subjects in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> were by Clift. Clift himself contributed papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1815 and 1823, to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal</span> for 1831, and to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society</span> in 1829 and 1835. His paper &#145;On the fossil remains &hellip; found on the left bank of the Irawadi&#146; in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society</span> for 1829 was reprinted in an appendix to John Crawfurd's <span class="italic">Journal of an Embassy from the Governor General of India to the Court of Ava</span> (1829). Richard Owen published in 1861 two volumes of <span class="italic">Essays and Observations on Natural History, Anatomy, &amp;c., by John Hunter</span>, drawn in the main from the private copies made by Clift of Hunter's manuscripts between 1793 and 1800. Clift himself had contemplated their publication and drawn up some notes for that purpose, but never carried this out. Some of these had been previously published in part in Owen and Clift's <span class="italic">Descriptive and illustrated catalogue of the physiological series of comparative anatomy contained in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons</span> (1833&#150;1840), but the whole collection was not placed in Owen's hands until a short time before Clift's death. With Owen's assistance, Clift was also the primary compiler of the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Hunterian Collection of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of London</span> (1830&#150;31).<br>
<br>In 1842 Clift retired from full-time duties at the museum and moved with his wife to Stanhope Cottage, Mornington Crescent, Hampstead Road; he was replaced as curator by his son-in-law. Caroline Clift died on 8 May 1849 and Clift himself died of unspecified causes at his home shortly afterwards, on 20 June 1849. Both were buried in Highgate cemetery. His esteem in the scientific and medical communities is indicated by several laudatory obituaries that appeared on his death in such periodicals as <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of London</span>.<br>
<br>Clift's personal effects were sold at auction in August 1849, and his papers were either retained by the College of Surgeons, were passed to Owen, or were acquired at auction. Those in the possession of Owen, including the main collection of the Clift correspondence, are now in the Natural History Museum as part of the Owen papers. An additional collection of manuscripts was obtained by the College of Surgeons in 1945 from materials that had been in the possession of Thomas Madden Stone, assistant librarian to the college from 1832 to 1853.<br>
