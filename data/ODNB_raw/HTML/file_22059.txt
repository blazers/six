<span class="headword">Pett, Sir  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">lawyer and author</span>, was baptized on 31 October 1630 at St Nicholas's Church, Deptford Green, Kent, the son of Peter Pett (1592&#150;1652), master shipwright at Deptford, and his wife, Elizabeth Johnson (<i>fl</i>. 1623&#150;1652). He was the grandson of Peter Pett of Wapping, shipbuilder, and great-grandson of Peter Pett (<i>d</i>. 1589), the Elizabethan royal master shipwright. Having been educated at Greenwich School and St Paul's School, he was admitted as a pensioner to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1645. After graduating BA in 1648 he migrated to Pembroke College, Oxford, and in 1649 was intruded into a fellowship at All Souls (from which he was ejected in 1660). He graduated BCL in 1650, was entered as a student at Gray's Inn, and settled there &#145;for good and all&#146; about a year before the Restoration.<br>
<br>When the Royal Society was formed, in 1663, Pett was one of the original fellows, elected on 20 May, but was expelled on 18 November 1675 for &#145;not performing his obligation to the society&#146;. He was probably absorbed in other interests. From 1661 to 1666 he sat in the Irish parliament as MP for Askeaton. He also participated profitably in the farm of Irish tax, and obtained Dutch property confiscated there. A prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey, he was appointed advocate-general for Ireland, where he was knighted by the duke of Ormond in 1663.<br>
<br>Back in London in the 1670s, Pett acted as the earl of Anglesey's man of business, entering politics under the earl of Danby. He opposed exclusion and moved closer to the political centre with the accession of James II, but became &#145;badly tarred with the brush of popery&#146; in the process  (Goldie, 251).<br>
<br>The editor of the memoirs of the first earl of Anglesey and Thomas Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, Pett is best known as a polemicist. In a <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning Liberty of Conscience</span> (1661) he argued for the comprehension of protestant &#145;dissent&#146; within an Anglican establishment broadened along the lines proposed by Archbishop James Ussher before the civil wars. Although intolerant of the kind of radical protestant ideology which had issued in regicide, he was prepared to accept peaceful unorthodoxy, and was generally latitudinarian in his belief in the passing of the age of religious controversy. He defended James II's declaration of indulgence in his <span class="italic">Obligation Resulting from the Oath of Supremacy</span> in 1687, albeit largely on pragmatic grounds. His most famous work is <span class="italic">The Happy Future State of England</span>, begun in 1681 and published in 1688, in which he followed the lead of Halifax and Anglesey in exploring the possibility of tory pragmatism. He was sceptical in his thinking, an Erastian ultimately indifferent to the theological differences between protestant and Catholic, believing first and foremost that the menace of popery must be eradicated from within both churches as a threat to the authority of the civil magistrate.<br>
<br>Pett died, unmarried, on 1 April 1699, and was buried on 19 April at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. In his will he bequeathed to his old school friend Samuel Pepys the ring given to Howard of Effingham by the admiral of the Spanish fleet in 1588. Pett has been often confused with his father's first cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22058/', "Peter Pett")</script>, commissioner of the navy at Chatham, who is separately noticed.<br>
