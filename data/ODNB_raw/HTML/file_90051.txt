<span class="headword">Parkes,  Terence</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Larry]</span>  (1927&#150;2003), <span class="occ">cartoonist</span>, was born on 19 November 1927 at 134 Heathfield Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, the only child of Walter Thomas Parkes, a welder in a motor-car factory, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hirons. At the time of the registration of his birth his parents lived at 2 Anglesey Street, Lozells, Birmingham. He was educated at Handsworth grammar school, Birmingham, and in September 1939 he and his classmates were evacuated to Stroud in Gloucestershire, returning to Birmingham soon after the fall of France. He started drawing cartoons while still at school and began to study fine art at the Birmingham College of Arts and Crafts but his training was interrupted by national service as a gunner in the Royal Artillery (1946&#150;8), stationed in Wales, co. Durham, and Portsmouth. After completing his art course he went on to qualify as an art teacher for the newly formed secondary modern schools. At about this time his first published cartoons appeared in the <span class="italic">Birmingham Sunday Mercury</span> and <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette</span>. On 26 July 1952 he married (Jean) Pauline Woodward, daughter of Ernest Edward Woodward, technical supervisor. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Parkes began work as an art teacher at Lincoln Road secondary modern school, Peterborough, Northamptonshire, in 1951, and it was there that he acquired his pseudonym, Larry, a nickname given to him by his pupils in honour of Larry Parks, star of <span class="italic">The Jolson Story</span> (1946), which was screened in the city in 1954. The same year he returned to Birmingham and worked as a progress-chaser in the Lucas Turbines factory (1954&#150;6) while continuing to produce cartoons in his spare time. His first drawings were accepted by <span class="italic">Punch</span> and <span class="italic">Lilliput</span> in 1954, and in the autumn of 1956 he was briefly a staff cartoonist on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> before turning full-time freelance in 1957. He moved to Solihull in 1959 and soon began working for numerous newspapers and magazines including (eventually) the <span class="italic">Birmingham Evening Mail</span> (sports cartoons), <span class="italic">Soldier</span>, <span class="italic">Punch</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>, <span class="italic">The Oldie</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Opera Now</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>. He also drew advertising cartoons for Double Diamond beer, HMSO, and the Inland Revenue, among others, produced cartoons and commentary for Granada TV's <span class="italic">Afternoon Edition</span> (1963&#150;4), supplied visual jokes for the TV comedian Marty Feldman, drew cartoons for the title credits of the comedy films <span class="italic">Carry On Up the Khyber</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Carry On Camping</span> (1972), and was a scenery painter at Joan Littlewood's Theatre Royal, London (1973&#150;4). He also produced greetings cards, calendars, plates, and bathroom tiles, and illustrated many books, including James Herriot's <span class="italic">Vets Might Fly</span> (1976), George Mikes's <span class="italic">How to be Poor</span> (1983), Stephen Pile's <span class="italic">The Return of Heroic Failures</span> (1988), and the <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> &#145;Colemanballs&#146; series (1982&#150;96).<br>
<br>Larry's first big cartoon success came in the late 1950s with his captionless <span class="italic">Punch</span> series &#145;Man in Apron&#146;, about a balding middle-aged, middle-class husband attempting to cook and do housework. The series (which had been suggested to him by Russell Brockbank, the art editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>) caught on quickly and led to a dozen books from <span class="italic">Man in Apron</span> (1959) to <span class="italic">Man on Holiday</span> (1973). Larry later said that the character was based on his father: &#145;Indefatigable he was&#151;though, like me, he always had a good head of hair. The reason I drew him bald was to distinguish him from the women&#151;my cartoon faces always look the same, male or female&#146;  (<span class="italic">Larry on Larry</span>, 9). Larry's jokes about fine art were also very popular&#151;the first collection of these was <span class="italic">Larry's Art Collection</span> (1977), followed by <span class="italic">Larry on Art</span> (1978)&#151;and in 1992 he began experimenting with three-dimensional clay cartoons on art themes. Other collections of his drawings included <span class="italic">The Larry Omnibus</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Best of Larry</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Larry at War</span> (1995). A light-hearted autobiographical book, <span class="italic">Larry on Larry</span>, appeared in 1994.<br>
<br>Larry won many awards for his cartoons, was elected an honorary fellow of Birmingham Polytechnic in 1991, and had his work exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, and in many commercial galleries in Britain and overseas. Some of his drawings were also included in the major exhibition, &#145;Drawn and quartered: the world of the British newspaper cartoon, 1720&#150;1970&#146; at the National Portrait Gallery in 1970. Examples of his work are held in such public collections as the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings, Essex University, the British Cartoon Archive at the University of Kent, and the Cartoon Museum, London.<br>
<br>A great fan of the humour of Jacques Tati, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, W. C. Fields, Will Hay, and Sid Field, Larry also admired the art of Daumier, Lautrec, and Van Gogh. His favourite cartoonist was Leslie Starke. Though Larry's drawing technique was entirely his own (it was Russell Brockbank who encouraged him to keep his loose, sketchy line by publishing drawings he had originally submitted as roughs), he later admitted that his &#145;big-nose style&#146; was influenced by the work of the French cartoonist Jean-Maurice Bosc. He worked very quickly, using an old-fashioned Rolinx dip pen and Pelikan or Rotring black ink (sometimes also coloured inks or watercolour) on ordinary typing paper. He rarely used words in his cartoons and was once described by the former <span class="italic">Punch</span> editor Alan Coren as &#145;the only great silent comedian still in business&#146;  (foreword, <span class="italic">The Best of Larry</span>, 1983).<br>
<br>Larry was 5 feet 10 inches tall and was normally clean-shaven with a full head of grey (formerly black) hair. He died after a short illness in Warwick Hospital on 25 June 2003, and was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
