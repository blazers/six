<span class="headword">Oliver,  John</span>  (1600/01&#150;1661), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was possibly born in Kent, although his father may have been the John Oliver (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1627) who was rector of Little Laver in Essex from April 1599 to May 1607, for it was to this rectory that Oliver himself was later presented. He matriculated from Merton College, Oxford, on 26 January 1616 aged fifteen, graduated BA from Magdalen in 1619, became a fellow in 1621, proceeded MA in 1622, and became tutor to Edward Hyde, later earl of Clarendon. He was incorporated MA at Cambridge in 1626, and was awarded the Oxford degree of BD in 1631. That year he was instituted to Eastmanstead Chenies, Buckinghamshire, on the presentation of the earl of Bedford, and between 1632 and 1638 he held Broughton Poges, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Oliver remained a fellow of Magdalen until about 1639, and it was probably towards the end of his tenure that &#145;his eminence in learning, and orthodox principles in religion being conspicuous&#146;, he was appointed a domestic chaplain to Archbishop William Laud  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.510). Gilbert Burnet stated that Laud sponsored his promotion in the church, and about this time more lucrative benefices came into Oliver's possession. In 1637 he acquired Little Laver, Essex, from 1638 to 1639 he was rector of Monks Eleigh, Suffolk, and in 1639 of Adisham in Kent. Also in 1639 he was awarded his doctorate. Collated on 19 August 1638 and installed on 21 September as canon of the twelfth prebend of Winchester Cathedral, he held the dignity for the next twenty-three years, though for most of that period its income was denied him. On 25 September 1640 Laud wrote from Lambeth to the earl of Pembroke recommending him for a chaplaincy-in-ordinary to the king, vacant through the death of Thomas Jackson. Oliver had &#145;preached twice to his Majesty with great approbation. I will be answerable for him every way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.583). Oliver was by this time well acquainted with Michael Oldsworth, secretary to Pembroke in his post of earl chamberlain. Five years later Laud bequeathed a watch to John Oliver.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1644, following the resignation of Accepted Frewen on 11 May, Oliver, nominated by all the fellows, and with Laud's backing, was admitted to the presidency of Magdalen College, Oxford. The day following, as Charles and his entourage watched from Magdalen tower on the eastern extremity of the city, the army of the earl of Essex moved towards them, drawing up on Bullingdon Green. The attack on Oxford was delayed for over two years, but when it came the fall of the royalists' military headquarters threatened also their control of the university. In May 1647 Oliver was one of the delegates elected by the university convocation which sought to delay on legal and procedural grounds the purge expected in the wake of the parliamentary visitors, but on 14 December 1647 the committee of the two houses declared several university figures, including the vice-chancellor and John Oliver, guilty of a &#145;high contempt of authority of Parliament&#146;. On 6 January 1648 they declared Oliver's removal from his place as president, and on 17 March, as he had not removed, sent an order demanding obedience on pain of arrest. By this time, however, Oliver had left Oxford, though retaining the keys to the presidential lodgings. On 12 April the earl of Pembroke arrived in the city; the doors of Magdalen were broken down and John Wilkinson, appointee of the visitors, was admitted as president of the college.<br>
<br>Nothing is certainly known about Oliver's activities during the 1650s, but he may have been the John Oliver who was vicar of St Margaret at Cliffe in Kent from 1655 to 1658. After the Restoration Oliver was readmitted to his prebend of Winchester. On 7 July 1660, through the influence of Edward Hyde, Oliver received the royal patent for the deanery of Worcester, subscribing to the articles before his installation on 12 September 1660. Oliver's chief concern in that year, however, was to reclaim his place as president at Magdalen. He petitioned as early as 18 May 1660, and was readmitted soon after. Named to two commissions of inquiry set up to visit the university, he appears not to have been very active in either. The restoration to their places at Magdalen of all living unmarried fellows and scholars led to tensions between this group and the Independent and presbyterian members who continued in residence. Oliver made it his business to try to keep the peace, and seems to have enjoyed considerable success. But the work seems not to have been to his taste. &#145;This most learned, meek, and pious person&#146;, reports Wood, &#145;was strangely desirous to leave this world, though few alive had then such temptations to stay in it&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 1.510). Oliver died on 27 October 1661 and was buried in Magdalen College chapel three days later; the funeral sermon was preached by Edmund Diggle. Oliver left money to the poor of several Oxfordshire and Kentish parishes and bequests for maintenance to the cathedrals of Worcester and St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.<br>
