<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moynihan,  Berkeley George Andrew</span>, first Baron Moynihan  (1865&#150;1936), <span class="occ">abdominal surgeon</span>, was born in Malta on 2 October 1865, youngest of three children and the only son of Captain Andrew Moynihan VC (1830&#150;1867), of the 90th regiment, afterwards of the 8th foot (the King's regiment), and Ellen Anne, younger daughter of Thomas Parkin, cabinet-maker, of Hurst near Ashton under Lyne. His father, of Anglo-Irish origin and the third generation of the Moynihan to serve in the army, died of brucellosis (Malta fever) when Moynihan was about eighteen months old; his mother then settled in Leeds with her sister, the wife of Police-Sergeant Alfred Ball. Supported by a small army pension to his mother and a scholarship as an officer's son, and helped by the reputation of his father's decoration for gallantry, Moynihan was educated in London at Christ's Hospital (1875&#150;81) and the Royal Naval School, New Cross (1881&#150;3). He made little intellectual impact but did well at swimming, which remained his favourite recreation. Although he was originally intended to follow his forebears into the army, he opted instead to study medicine and entered the Leeds medical school, which was then at the Yorkshire College. He graduated MB, BS (London) in 1887.<br>
<br>Loyal to his home institution Moynihan refused offers of a job elsewhere and was appointed house surgeon to William Mayo-Robson at the General Infirmary at Leeds, a post he held until early in 1889. Some (unrecorded) time in Berlin followed and he was then appointed resident surgical officer at the General Infirmary, a post which gave unrivalled experience of urgent admissions for surgical illnesses and which was generally regarded in the organization of large teaching hospitals as the path to preferment for an appointment to the consultant staff. In this post Moynihan attracted the attention of Thomas Richard Jessop, one of the senior surgeons in the area. Moynihan became Jessop's assistant in 1894 and also began his own private practice, but he was not elected to a vacancy which occurred at the infirmary in the same year, probably owing to (as his biographer notes) his youth and arrogance. However, two years later he became assistant surgeon at the infirmary; was advanced to full surgeon in 1906; and, after serving the then statutory twenty years, was appointed consulting surgeon in 1926. In 1909 he was made professor of clinical surgery in the University of Leeds, an institution which had been founded some years previously. In later years he had an additional practice in London by commuting from Leeds and employing assistants who profited professionally from the association.<br>
<br>From 1896 the progress of Moynihan's surgical career was rapid, not only locally but also on the national and international stage. In this Moynihan was aided by his manual dexterity, his thoughtfulness about the underlying principles of the rapidly expanding discipline of abdominal surgery, by his undoubted qualities of oratory, and by his craftsmanship in the written word. According to E. W. Hey Groves:<blockquote>He took great care of his hands, keeping the skin from getting rough or cracked; while constantly, in idle moments, he practised feats of manual dexterity&#151;for example, knotting and unknotting a piece of string with the fingers of one hand, both left and right. (Groves, 13 April 1940, 604)</blockquote>He also had a feel for the apt descriptive phrase: &#145;making the patient safe for surgery&#146; (referring to the need for pre- and post-operative care), and &#145;the pathology of the living&#146; (a plea for the study of disease in its early stages), being but two examples. The growth of his clinical practice was rapid and was certainly helped by what his <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> entry called (perhaps a shade unfairly) his &#145;consummate showmanship&#146;. Nevertheless, his pre-eminence had yet been little recognized in Britain when, in May 1903, he was invited by the American Surgical Association (the senior surgical body in the USA) to read a paper at its meeting. The experience enabled him to form lasting friendships with surgeons who were at the helm of the discipline in the United States, such as the brothers William and Charles Mayo, and George Crile. Publication of a number of texts&#151;now inevitably dated but classics in their time&#151;took place over the years 1903&#150;24 and enhanced his reputation. Virtually nothing that he wrote has stood the scientific test of time, though his interpretation of the cause of duodenal ulcer was justified by the knowledge then available. The analytic approach he adopted was, however, of importance in the development of his clinical method of careful assessment, gentle surgery, and good decision-making, all of which have survived. He was an advocate, though not a practitioner, of the scientific approach to surgery, including the need for surgical research; in particular some of his lectures, including the Hunterian oration in 1927 and the Romanes lecture in Oxford in 1932, endorse this view.<br>
<br>Moynihan is remembered by surgeons chiefly for his surgical artistry but his influence went beyond this. He was part of the surgical establishment: elected to the council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1912 and its president from 1926 for six years, he fostered its wider influence. He felt that eminent senior practising clinicians such as himself and Lord Dawson of Penn (president of the Royal College of Physicians) should develop and control medical research policy, and he was indeed able to persuade the college of surgeons in 1928 to establish an institute for research relevant to surgery at Buckstone Browne Farm (opened in 1933). However, the influence of the colleges on research was trenchantly opposed by Walter M. Fletcher, then largely responsible for the direction that the Medical Research Council was to take, who espoused the argument that it was not, in Gowland Hopkin's words to Fletcher, &#145;&#147;Distinguished Clinicians&#148; who think the great thoughts which advance medicine&#146;. The view which prevailed after a lengthy and often bitter clash both in public and in private correspondence was not that of Moynihan but of the non-clinical scientists, unfairly dubbed by him as truants from clinical research. Both sides had selective experience to support their views but it can be credibly argued that Moynihan's persistence and rhetoric entrenched an attitude that still persists in medical research in the UK. Moynihan was also unable to gain membership of the Royal Society, which he felt, without objectivity, was his due. He was also, because of his background as a &#145;provincial&#146; surgeon in Yorkshire, convinced of the need for a more vociferous role for those outside London and campaigned for and founded both the <span class="italic">British Journal of Surgery</span> in 1913 and the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in 1920. In addition his flamboyance and success resulted in the formation in 1909 of a surgical club&#151;ultimately to be called, when his baronetcy was awarded, the Moynihan Chirurgical Club&#151;which to the end of the century allowed a group of distinguished members of the profession to travel between centres of surgical activity.<br>
<br>Between 1914 and 1915 Moynihan served in France as a consulting surgeon, rising to the rank of major-general. In this role he was influential in setting up the medical services for the British expeditionary force, particularly helped by his good command of both German and French. Later he continued as chairman of the Council of Consultants (1916&#150;19) and as a member of the army medical advisory board. In 1917 he went to the United States as a semi-official delegate of the British government to promote American involvement in the war, a mission he conducted with great success&#151;largely the outcome of his ability to sway an audience. Moynihan was knighted in 1912; appointed CB in 1917 and KCMG in 1918; and made a baronet in 1922. He then, in the same year, became a peer as Baron Moynihan of Leeds. In the Lords he was less successful than would have been predicted from his oratorical experience elsewhere but he had some influence on the affairs of the day in medical fields such as osteopathy. His other honours were numerous and included many honorary doctorates and memberships of societies.<br>
<br>Moynihan was married on 17 April 1895 to Isabella Wellesley Jessop (<i>b</i>. 1872/3), second daughter of his mentor in Leeds, Thomas Jessop. They had a son and two daughters. Lady Moynihan died on 1 September 1936, which seemed to remove Moynihan's will to live; he suffered a fatal stroke six days later at their home, Carr Manor, Meanwood, Leeds. He was buried, in spite of an offer of Westminster Abbey, in the Lawnswood cemetery at Leeds, the city with which he had identified throughout his career.<br>
<br>Moynihan was a complex personality. He had exceptional skills in his chosen field, marked ability for self-promotion, a sense of his own importance, and the possession of the physical and mental ability to achieve. He answered to his own description of the &#145;ideal&#146; surgeon: &#145;a handsome man of distinguished presence, a man of wide knowledge and general culture, a man of great technical skill and sound judgment, and a man of compassionate heart&#146;. Whether he fulfilled his own definition is open to some lingering doubt. He stood 6 feet tall and was broad in proportion; until middle life his hair was a fiery red. He was widely read and had an organizational ability that carried him to the front of his profession. Many of his contemporaries thought him over-indulgent of his own skills and the younger generation in the 1920s and 1930s felt that his attitudes should give way to a more truly analytic and scientific approach. However, his was a landmark in the development of British surgical practice and he mixed his individualistic personality with real contributions to surgical care and organization.<br>
