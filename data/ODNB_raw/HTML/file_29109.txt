<span class="headword">Westcott,  George Blagden</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1798), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized at Honiton on Otter, Devon, on 24 April 1753, the son of Benjamin Westcott, possibly a baker, at Honiton; his mother, Susanna, whose obituary is given in the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span> (29.352), died at Honiton in 1813 aged eighty-two. Westcott joined the frigate <i>Solebay</i> (28 guns), as master's mate, under the command of Captain Lucius O'Bryen, in 1768. As master's mate, able seaman, and midshipman he continued in the <i>Solebay</i> for nearly five years under O'Bryen and George Vandeput. He then served for three years in the <i>Albion</i> as midshipman with Samuel Barrington and John Leveson-Gower, and passed his lieutenant's examination on 10 January 1776 when he was described as &#145;appearing&#146; to be &#145;more than twenty-two&#146;. On 6 August 1777 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Valiant</i>, still with Leveson-Gower, and afterwards with Samuel Granston Goodall. In this position he saw action at the battle off Ushant on 27 July 1778, and served in the fleet under Sir Charles Hardy the younger in the summer of 1779, and under Vice-Admiral George Darby at the relief of Gibraltar in April 1781.<br>
<br>In November Westcott was moved into the <i>Victory</i>, and he thus carried the flag of Rear-Admiral Richard Kempenfelt in his brilliant attack on the French convoy on 12 December, and of Richard, Lord Howe, in the relief of Gibraltar and the action off Cape Spartel in October 1782. Gaining scarce peacetime employment in the <i>Medway</i>, he became, in 1786, first lieutenant of the <i>Salisbury</i>, carrying the broad pennant of Commodore John Elliot, the commander-in-chief in Newfoundland, and on 1 December 1787 he was promoted commander. In 1789&#150;90 he commanded the sloop <i>Fortune</i>, and from her he was promoted captain on 1 October 1790, during the Nootka Sound crisis with Spain, and he was thereafter appointed to the <i>London</i> as flag captain to his old chief Goodall. The <i>London</i> was paid off in late 1791, at the conclusion of the Ochakov confrontation with Russia.<br>
<br>Westcott remained on half pay until September 1793, when he joined the <i>Impregnable</i> as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Benjamin Caldwell, with whom he took part in the battle of 1 June 1794. Afterwards he followed Caldwell to the <i>Majestic</i>, went with him to the West Indies, and remained there with Sir John Laforey, whom he brought to England in June 1796. As a private ship the <i>Majestic</i> then joined the Channel Fleet, was with John Colpoys off Brest in December, and with Lord Bridport during the mutiny at Spithead in April and May 1797. Towards the end of the year she joined the fleet off Cadiz under the earl of St Vincent, and in May 1798 she was one of the ships sent up the Mediterranean to join Sir Horatio Nelson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96379', "Nelson's band of brothers")</script>]. In the battle of Abu Qir Bay (1 August 1798) her position in the rear of the line made her one of the last to join the action, and in the darkness and smoke she ran afoul of the French <i>Heureux</i>, in which position she remained caught for several minutes and suffered heavy loss. At this time Westcott was killed by a musket-ball in the throat. He was buried at sea in Abu Qir Bay on 2 August.<br>
<br>It is as one of the celebrated &#145;band of brothers&#146; and by his death in the hour of victory that Westcott is best known. Lord Collingwood wrote of him: &#145;A good officer and a worthy man; but, if it was a part of our condition to choose a day to die on, where could he have found one so memorable, so eminently distinguished among great days?&#146; For Samuel Granston Goodall:<blockquote>He sleeps in the bed of honour, and in all probability will be immortalised among the heroes in the Abbey. <i>Requiescat in pace</i>. Never could he have died more honourably. I have him to lament among many deserving men whom I have patronised, that have passed away in the prime of their lives. (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters of &hellip; Nelson</span>, 3.86&#150;7)</blockquote>A monument to his memory was erected at the public expense in St Paul's Cathedral. At Honiton also a monument was erected by subscription. However, it must be noted that he had no close links with Nelson, and in fact he was one of five captains never called to Nelson's ship. Samuel Hood remarked uncharitably that his loss was &#145;not felt&#146;  (Lavery, 218).<br>
<br>Westcott was survived by his wife, about whom further details are unknown, and their daughter. In January 1801, while passing through Honiton, Nelson invited them to breakfast, and presented Westcott's widow with his own Nile medal, saying, &#145;You will not value it less because Nelson has worn it&#146;. On 17 January 1801 he wrote to Lady Hamilton:<blockquote>At Honiton I visited Captain Westcott's mother&#151;poor thing, except from the bounty of government and Lloyd's, in very low circumstances. The brother is a tailor, but had they been chimney-sweepers it was my duty to show them respect. (Gamlin, 1.64)</blockquote>
