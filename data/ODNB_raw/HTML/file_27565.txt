<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Torrens,  Robert</span>  (1780?&#150;1864), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was the first of three children of Robert Torrens (<i>fl</i>. 1758&#150;1790) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1762&#150;1790), third daughter of the Revd Skeffington Bristow and his wife, Elizabeth Gore Grattan. He was born either at his paternal grandfather's house, Hervey Hill rectory, near Kilrea, Londonderry, or at the house of his maternal grandfather, Hazelwood, Resharkin, co. Antrim. He was probably educated at Derry diocesan school.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>On 1 February 1796 Torrens was commissioned second lieutenant in the corps of marines; he was promoted first lieutenant on 18 November 1797. He served at Plymouth, Chatham, and Woolwich divisions and in detachments aboard Royal Navy ships on escort service and policing British waters. He was with HMS <i>Glenmore</i> on the Cork station when he married Charity Herbert (<i>c</i>.1784&#150;1854), second daughter of Richard Chute (<i>fl</i>. 1770&#150;1820), of Chute Lodge, Cork City, and Chute Hall, Roxborough, co. Kerry, at St Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cork, on 8 November 1801. Their four children, born in Cork and co. Kerry, included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27566/', "Robert Richard Chute Torrens")</script>, first premier of South Australia and author of the <span class="roman">Torrens Act</span>. By September 1819 Torrens had &#145;long been separated and for some time divorced&#146; and was robbed of &#145;a fortune more than sufficient&#146; by the death of his intended second wife  (Torrens to Place, 30 Sept 1819, BL, Add. MS 37949, fol. 79). He somehow nullified his Irish marriage (but legitimized his children by having them rebaptized at St Mary's, Woolwich, in 1819). On 12 December 1820 he married a minor English heiress, Esther Sarah Serle (1778&#150;1874), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25097/', "Ambrose Serle RN")</script>, commissioner of transport, and his wife, Martha Priaulx.<br>
<br>Torrens was promoted captain on 26 July 1806. While participating in the economic warfare of Britain's &#145;continental blockade&#146;, he began writing the first of about ninety books and pamphlets on economics, politics, and social questions. <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Catholic Question</span> (1808) supported Catholic emancipation and described his Irish nationalism. Six months later his d&eacute;but in political economy, <span class="italic">The Economists Refuted</span> (1808), grounded his thinking on free trade and colonies. Two &#145;delightfully naive&#146;  (Corry), &#145;very bad&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>) novels followed. <span class="italic">Coelibia Choosing a Husband</span> (1809), the heroine of which is a budding political economist, advocated higher education for women and pilloried Hannah More's <span class="italic">Coelebs Choosing a Wife</span> (1808) and its imitators. <span class="italic">The Hermit of Killarney: a Catholic Tale</span> (1813) fictionalized Torrens's frustration at the failure of emancipation, his support for which cost him a seat in the Commons. &#145;Habits of patient investigation&#146; were interrupted by Torrens's appointment in August 1810 to the Isle of Anholt in the Kattegut off Copenhagen under Captain J. W. Maurice RN. On 27 March 1811 Torrens's 380 marines repelled a Danish landing involving 4000 personnel. Wounded slightly, he was gazetted brevet major on 9 April and the Admiralty promised him a major's pay and the Anholt command after Maurice. Relations with Maurice soured and Torrens was relieved in January 1812 for insubordination, yet pressed charges against Maurice; Torrens used his accommodating withdrawal in August for patronage over the next twenty years. He led his marines at the storming of Antwerp in February 1814 and sought, unsuccessfully, a variety of commands and staff appointments. Recruiting (mainly) and a new bayonet drill (briefly) were all the corps offered after 1815 as duties collided with aspirations. Annual applications (1815&#150;22) to retire owing to ill health were denied. He became lieutenant-colonel by brevet on 12 August 1819. &#145;Private interests&#146; forced the Admiralty to give him half-pay in September 1823. He returned to full pay in 1830 and on 4 June 1831 was appointed major. Three times he tried to sell out as a lieutenant-colonel, but was allowed to dispose only of a majority (17 October 1834).<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareerandeconomicthought"></a>Political career and economic thought</h2>Meanwhile, fuelled by his brand of Irish nationalism and a thinly veiled desire for personal advancement, Torrens consolidated his contemporary reputation. The anti-bullionist <span class="italic">Essay on Money</span> (March 1812) led to an offer of a Treasury borough that lapsed because of his refusal to abandon emancipation. Converted to the bullionist credo by 1826, Torrens went on to lead the currency school. More important in his early career was his systematic and creative critique of Ricardo, which asserted that capital rather than labour was the better measure of value. <span class="italic">An Essay on the External Corn Trade</span> (1815) discovered the principle of comparative advantage in international trade and shared with Ricardo and Malthus the discovery of the law of diminishing returns. Torrens also subverted Malthus by advocating colonization to alleviate overpopulation. His publications of this period culminated in his most general treatise, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Production of Wealth</span> (1821), but this neither lived up to earlier promise nor received its advertised sequel on distribution.<br>
<br>Torrens was politically unorthodox too, as he courted men of all parties to have his economic views pass into public policy. He endorsed Francis Burdett's reform proposals in 1809 and, after failing to win Rochester in June 1818, bore them out in his justificatory <span class="italic">Letter to the Freemen</span> (1819). He won Ipswich for the whigs in mid-June at a cost of &pound;5000, determined to be independent, though friends feared he would &#145;feel his way to some place&#146;. His maiden speech occurred during a corn law debate (24 November 1826), but he was unseated the following February. Unsuccessful at Pontefract (July 1830), he won Ashburton for its owner, without party support (June 1831). King William wanted him cashiered for suggesting, in September 1832, the abolition of the House of Lords. Instead, the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> abolished Torrens's seat at Ashburton&#151;not before a &#145;tipsy speech&#146; preceded being &#145;as sick as a dog in the Long Gallery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Thomas Babington Macaulay</span>, 11 March 1833, 2.232). He topped the polls at Bolton in December 1833 but was defeated in January 1835 and did not contest a further seat. He was &#145;generally listened to with attention in the house&#146;, though an &#145;unmusical&#146; voice (his Ulster burr?) and affected manner detracted from his otherwise &#145;effective speeches&#146;  (Grant, 188&#150;91).<br>
<br>Newspapers gave Torrens his livelihood and his chief conduit for receiving and giving patronage, as a publicist for reform and economics. During 1820 Torrens led a syndicate that made <span class="italic">The Traveller</span>, a London evening paper, whig and a mouthpiece of political economy. Merging it with <span class="italic">The Globe</span> (30 December 1822) also made it England's second-largest daily; by 1828 it monopolized the evening paper market. Torrens retired as manager by mid-1826 but, &#145;chief though dormant partner&#146; still, he continued to influence policy and management as late as 1858. Even under Brougham's sway, the paper was usually &#145;ministerial&#146; on the Liberal side. For professional debate&#151;fellowship of the Royal Society (10 December 1819) being inadequate to the purpose&#151;Torrens helped form the Political Economy Club, and chaired its inaugural meeting on 30 April 1821. The club broke Ricardo's dominance of discussion.<br>
<br>Ricardo's death (September 1823) enhanced Torrens's standing as a theoretician and freed him to do his greatest work: to force the Colonial Office's hand on colonization and emigration, thereby modernizing the empire. From March 1825 he promoted the idea of commercial colonization through the New Zealand Company and kept the government's focus on the subject throughout 1826&#150;31. He had petitioned (1816) to be governor of New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land; to a renewed application for the latter he added another for a large land grant and a senior post at Swan River (1828&#150;31). Under-secretary Wilmot Horton promised him a seat on any &#145;colonial board&#146; that eventuated (1826) and, in the Commons on 15 February 1827, Torrens supported Horton's successful motion for another emigration committee. Torrens sought &#145;parliamentary or official employment&#146; from liberal ministers (1827&#150;32) but received only the contract for the new <span class="italic">Police Gazette</span> (28 January 1828). Denied membership of the colonial land board (1828) and the Irish and emigration commissions (1831), Torrens was by 1832 the acknowledged leader of the &#145;systematic colonisers&#146; clandestinely dominated by E. G. Wakefield, though Torrens's variant, &#145;self-supporting colonisation&#146;, encouraged the peasant proprietorship that Wakefield abhorred. He chaired the National Colonization Society (formed in 1830), led its negotiations with the Colonial Office, and helped float the South Australian Land Company (1832&#150;3). He was integral to the South Australian Association's wrangles with four successive colonial secretaries (1833&#150;5). When the <span class="roman">South Australia Act</span> established a commission to sell colonial land and dispatch emigrants (August 1834), he used political credit to be gazetted chairman (5 May 1835). Three weeks later he completed <span class="italic">The Colonization of South Australia</span> and the commissioners set about preliminary land sales, recruiting emigrants and raising loans. Torrens alienated Wakefield over the appropriate price for land and became the experiment's chief manager.<br>
<br>Torrens then proposed additional remedies for Ireland. Early in 1836 he lobbied to set aside a portion of all colonial land revenues for an Irish emigration fund. The resulting select committee on the disposal of colonial lands was a victory for Wakefield's opinions over Torrens's. Wakefield went on to colonize New Zealand, though he had to compromise with Torrens's New Zealand Company of 1825. Torrens failed to have emigration included in the new Irish poor law (1837&#150;8), so in Dublin, in July 1839, he helped form the South Australian Colonization Society. Adversaries called him the &#145;Irish exterminator&#146;, as Irish investment and emigration picked up during 1840&#150;42 to Torrens's envisioned &#145;New Hibernia&#146;. By then Lord John Russell had replaced the South Australian commission with the colonial land and emigration commission (15 January 1840). Torrens was chairman, making him (briefly) the chief executive officer of the British empire. When South Australia's bankruptcy was clear (January 1841), he agreed to resign for purchasing land in the colony contrary to an 1835 ruling by Lord Glenelg. He gave up office when Russell's committee of inquiry reported unfavourably (9 April), though without indicting him. He began lobbying immediately for reinstatement and compensation, relenting only when, on Torrens's resignation from the Political Economy Club in February 1851 owing to ill health, Russell granted him a civil-list pension of &pound;200 p.a. (July 1851) not as South Australian compensation but for &#145;services to political economy&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1841 Torrens began the notorious series of pamphlets <span class="italic">The Budget: on Commercial and Colonial Policy</span> (1844), which abrogated classical doctrine by proposing a theory of reciprocity of import tariffs as a protectionist exception to international free trade. Torrens cultivated Benjamin Disraeli along these lines (1847&#150;52). He also renewed pressure for colonization to aid famine-stricken Ireland in <span class="italic">Ireland Saved</span> (1847, 1849). But it was banking that dominated Torrens's last twenty years. Peel's <span class="roman">Bank of England Charter Act</span> 1844 owed much to Torrens's &#145;currency scheme&#146; and &#145;bank arrangement&#146; of 1836 (for which he sought a &pound;10,000 gratuity from the Bank of England), and to his currency controversy with Thomas Tooke, 1840&#150;44. Torrens's classic defence of the act went through six manifestations (1847&#150;58). During 1856&#150;7 he worked on &#145;a treatise on money&#146; and in July 1860 on a reply to Michael Chevalier on the value of gold, but he admitted to &#145;failing powers&#146;. His last original work was his review of &#145;Lord Overstone on metallic and paper currency&#146; in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (January 1858). His final public activity was to dispute the withdrawal of his <span class="italic">Police Gazette</span> contract, and compensation, with the Treasury and Home Office (1858&#150;62).<br>
<br>Torrens settled at 36 Regency Square, Brighton, in 1857 after living in London in coffee houses, hotels, clubs, and rooms, and since the age of sixty in Welsh mountain towns and at the English seaside to combat perennial bronchitis. In 1861 he moved to 16 Craven Hill, Bayswater. He died there of an abscess on the lung on 27 May 1864 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 30 May. His estate, &#145;under &pound;16,000&#146;, consisted of annuity interests in a freehold estate, considerable funds, and some railway shares, his colonial investments having been long since realized or conveyed to his surviving son, Robert.<br>
<br>Torrens has undergone a respectable rehabilitation since his work was adjudged &#145;devoid of interest&#146;  (Harris, 550). His writings may be grandiloquent, pompous, and clogged with arithmetical examples, but his intellectual positions place him &#145;high up in the second class&#146; among classical economists  (Robbins, 1&#150;2). Torrens, &#145;gentlemanly and prepossessing&#146;, had a &#145;finely proportioned figure&#146; and &#145;an intellectual expression&#146;  (Grant, 191). Politicians did not always esteem his support yet they underrated his tenacity; economists found him combative though courteous in debate; colonizers found him inconsistent and indecisive; South Australian historians blame him for corrupting Wakefield's vision and bringing the colony to its knees. Friends and family thought him tender and generous, and his great-nephew William Torrens McCullagh Torrens, a reforming politician and writer on free trade, added Torrens to his surname in 1863 as a mark of respect.<br>
