<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Longworth,  Maria Theresa</span>  (1833&#150;1881), <span class="occ">plaintiff in a case of disputed marriage and author</span>, was born at Cheetwood, near Manchester, the youngest of six children of Thomas Longworth, silk manufacturer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fox. Thomas Longworth's business, and at one time his residence also, was in a large house at the corner of Quay Street and Longworth Street, Manchester. Maria's mother died when she was very young, and she was educated at an Ursuline convent school in Boulogne, France, where she became a Roman Catholic. She spent two years in Italy completing her education. On her return to her father's house at Smedley near Manchester, disagreements with him on religious subjects arose, and she spent much of her time with a married sister in Boulogne, or on visits to friends.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1852, while crossing the channel with some friends, Maria Longworth was introduced to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30216/', "William Charles Yelverton, afterwards fourth Viscount Avonmore")</script>, and a correspondence between them began. In 1855 she served as a nurse with the French Sisters of Charity during the Crimean War, and met Yelverton again at the Galata Hospital, when she accepted his proposal of marriage. Yelverton's relatives disapproved of the engagement and it was broken off for a time; but on 12 April 1857 the couple went through a private ceremony of marriage in Scotland, when Yelverton read aloud the Church of England marriage service at Maria Longworth's lodgings at 1 Vincent Street, Edinburgh. They were afterwards married by a priest at the Roman Catholic chapel at Rostrevor in Ireland, and then lived together in Ireland and Scotland.<br>
<br>On 26 June 1858, while Maria was in Edinburgh, Yelverton formally married Emily Marianne Forbes, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9824/', "Professor Edward Forbes")</script>. On 31 October 1859 Maria Longworth, claiming to be Yelverton's wife, sued him for restitution of conjugal rights in the London probate court, but the court decided that it had no jurisdiction over the marriage. In 1861 an action was brought in Dublin by Mr Thelwall, in whose house Maria Longworth had been living, to recover from Yelverton money Thelwall had supplied to her. This action lasted from 21 February to 4 March 1861, and the validity of both the Scottish and the Irish marriage was established in the Irish court. In July 1862 on appeal the Scottish court of session annulled the marriage, and the judgement was affirmed by a majority of the House of Lords on 28 July 1864, although Lord Brougham declared in Maria Longworth's favour. Her attempt to reopen the case at Edinburgh in March 1865 failed, and the House of Lords on 30 July 1867 supported the Scottish court. Finally her appeal to the court of session, on 29 October 1868, to set aside the judgment of the House of Lords was rejected. Much sympathy was shown to her in this long and unsuccessful struggle, and a subscription was raised on her behalf in Manchester. A novel based on the affair, <span class="italic">Gentle Blood</span>, was published by J. R. O'Flanagan in 1861. In 1867 <span class="italic">A Wife and not a Wife</span> by Cyrus Redding appeared, similarly inspired by Maria Longworth's case.<br>
<br>Maria Longworth spent her later years in travel, and died of dropsy at Pietermaritzburg, Natal, on 13 September 1881. She was buried the next day in the Church of England cemetery in Pietermaritzburg.<br>
<br>What money Maria Longworth had was spent in the litigation, and she largely supported herself by writing. Her chief works were <span class="italic">Martyrs to Circumstance</span> (1861), <span class="italic">The Yelverton Correspondence, with Introduction and Connecting Narrative</span> (1863), <span class="italic">Zanita: a Tale of the Yo-Semite</span> (1872), and two books about travel.<br>
