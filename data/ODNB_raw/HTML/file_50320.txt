<span class="headword">Dufour <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Sarratt]</span>,  (Elizabeth) Camilla</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">singer and writer</span>, made her d&eacute;but in a concert at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, on 11 February 1796 and that season sang at the Pantheon and in Johann Peter Salomon's Hanover Square concerts. Her father arranged that Michael Kelly and Anna Maria Crouch should give her lessons in singing and acting in return for a percentage of her salary. She was to have been introduced at Kelly's benefit in May 1797 and then have a summer season at the Haymarket, with a specially written prologue for the d&eacute;but there of &#145;this little native of Britannia's Isle&#146;  (Young, 277). However, her parents broke with Kelly and negotiated a lucrative contract with Richard Brinsley Sheridan at Drury Lane, where she made her first stage appearance in the soprano role of Adela in Stephen Storace's <span class="italic">The Haunted Tower</span> on 19 October 1797. She sang well but lacked the acting skills to compensate for her short, plump figure, and during that season made only four appearances as Adela and four more as Amphitrite in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>.<br>
<br>Miss Dufour was a soloist in the Covent Garden oratorios in Lent 1798 and sang again at Drury Lane only as one of the priestesses in Sheridan's <span class="italic">Pizarro</span> in May and June 1799. She turned to writing, producing stories for periodicals and, in 1803, <span class="italic">Aurora, or, The Mysterious Beauty</span>, a translation of J. J. M. Duperche's French novel based on F. J. H. von Soden's play <span class="italic">Aurora, oder, Das Kind der H&ouml;lle</span>. <a href="#cosubject_50320">Jacob Henry Sarratt [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the future &#145;professor of chess&#146;, was writing for the same publisher and they married at St Leonard, Shoreditch, on 30 December 1804. Mary Julia Young, in her <span class="italic">Memoirs of Mrs. Crouch</span> (1806), wrote: &#145;it would be difficult to find a more accomplished, a more amiable, or a happier couple, than Mr. and Mrs. Sarrat&#146;  (Young, 312). Mrs Sarratt was for a time the leading singer in John Philip Conway Astley's company, which performed at Astley's Amphitheatre, Wesminster Bridge, in summer and at the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, in winter. In 1809 she played Polly to Robert Elliston's Macheath in his burletta version of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at the Royal Circus. Her last stage appearance seems to have been at the Royal Circus on 30 October 1809. Sarratt died, after a long illness, in 1819. By 1843 his widow had been living in Paris for some years, giving chess lessons to numerous pupils, including members of the aristocracy. Over the next three years a subscription was raised for her, to which King Louis-Philippe and many French and English chess amateurs contributed. In December 1846 the chess magazine <span class="italic">Le Palam&egrave;de</span>, which had been active in her support, reported that she had died in Paris after a short illness, aged eighty-five, although she was probably about fifteen years younger than that.<br>
<br>Mrs Sarratt's husband, <a name="cosubject_50320"></a><span class="headword">Jacob Henry Sarratt</span>  (1772/3&#150;1819), was remembered as &#145;the famous Sarratt, the great <span class="occ">chess teacher</span>, whose fee was a guinea a lesson&#146;  (Tuckwell, 65). His early life is obscure. He married his first wife, Marie Bruzard (<i>d</i>. 1802&times;4), at St Saviour, Jersey, on 3 July 1790, and they were settled in London by late 1799. They had at least two children, Mary Ann Louisa, born on 11 December 1799, and Susan Catherine, born on 1 February 1802. He worked as a schoolmaster, and wrote <span class="italic">The History of Man &hellip; Adapted to the Capacities of Youth</span>, two translations of Gothic novels, <span class="italic">The Three Monks!!!</span> and <span class="italic">Koenigsmark the Robber, or, The Terror of Bohemia</span>, and a useful pocket guide, <span class="italic">A View of London</span>, all published between 1802 and 1804. As &#145;Lieut. Sarratt, of the Royal York Mary-le-bone Volunteers&#146;, he published his <span class="italic">Life of Buonaparte</span> (1803), a rousing attack on &#145;the tyrant who swears eternal hatred to Britons&#146;  (p. 285). Sarratt had become interested in chess before the death of the French master Fran&ccedil;ois-Andr&eacute; Danican Philidor in 1795 and learned much from Verdoni, Philidor's successor as professional at the English Chess Club. With Hippolyte de Bourblanc he enjoyed &#145;an uninterrupted friendship of fifteen years' duration&#146;  (J. H. Sarratt, <span class="italic">A New Treatise on the Game of Chess</span> 1821, 29), until Bourblanc's death in 1813. They frequently played chess together without a board &#145;while strolling in the pleasant meadows then skirting the north of London&#146;  (Walker, 117). After Verdoni's death in 1804 Sarratt became London's leading chess professional. Under his influence the London Chess Club (founded in 1807) adopted the continental rule that a game ending in stalemate was a draw, not a win for the player stalemated, as hitherto in England. <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Game of Chess</span> by &#145;J. H. Sarratt <i>Professor of Chess</i>&#146; came out in 1808, and he later published <span class="italic">The Works of Damiano, Ruy-Lopez, and Salvio</span> (1813) and <span class="italic">The Works of Gianutio, and Gustavus Selenus</span> (1817), translations which made the writings of earlier masters accessible to English players. William Hazlitt came to know &#145;old S[arratt], tall and gaunt&#146; as a fellow habitu&eacute; of the Salopian Coffee House. Hazlitt's <span class="italic">On Coffee-House Politicians</span> includes a portrait of this extraordinary man, who had once been a prize-fighter and was still proud of his strength, a great reader who could recite Ossian by heart but whose memory &#145;tyrannised over and destroyed all power of selection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 195&#150;6). Sarratt's health was apparently in decline by autumn 1817, and he died on 6 November 1819, when he was said to be in his forty-seventh year. His last work, <span class="italic">A New Treatise on the Game of Chess</span>, which included a beginners' section in question-and-answer form, was published in 1821. William Lewis, his most distinguished pupil, oversaw a revised version of Sarratt's 1808 <span class="italic">Treatise</span> in 1822. In the same year Lewis, in his preface to his own translation of Pietro Carrera, described Sarratt as &#145;the finest and most finished player&#146; he had ever seen, &#145;alike excellent in attack and defence&#146;.<br>
