<span class="headword">Poyntz, Sir  Anthony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1532/3), <span class="occ">naval commander</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70796/', "Sir Robert Poyntz (b. late 1440s, d. 1520)")</script> and Margaret, the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29937/', "Anthony Woodville, second Earl Rivers")</script>. He was descended from a cadet branch of the family based at Iron Acton in Gloucestershire since the early fourteenth century. Poyntz served Henry VIII as a naval officer and played a minor part in Wolsey's ceremonial diplomacy between 1518 and 1521. In 1513 he commissioned and led a small flotilla of ships from Bristol as part of the fleet in Edward Howard's ill-fortuned expedition against Brittany. He was knighted the same year. Nine years later, as captain of the <i>Santa Maria</i>, he joined the force led by Howard's brother, the earl of Surrey, on another raid against the Breton coast and participated in the small but bloody battle of Morlaix. In 1523 he was given the <i>ad hoc</i> title of vice-admiral, and between April and September was entrusted with the task of intercepting the duke of Albany should he attempt to bring French support to Scotland. That Albany succeeded in transporting 5000 soldiers via the Irish Channel was largely the responsibility of the admiral, Sir William Fitzwilliam, who denuded the western seas by leading a fruitless raid against Tr&eacute;port.<br>
<br>Poyntz's diplomatic duties were purely ceremonial. He took part in the festivities arranged to celebrate the treaty of London in November 1518, although he was not included in the embassy subsequently dispatched to France. He was also among Henry's entourage at his meetings with Fran&ccedil;ois I at the Field of Cloth of Gold and the emperor Charles V at Gravelines, both held in July 1520. The few records remaining that detail Poyntz's administrative and judicial activities are no doubt a poor reflection of the responsibilities that as a leading member of the gentry he almost certainly undertook. In May 1521 he sat on the jury at Bristol that indicted the duke of Buckingham. He was appointed sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1527 and in 1530 was part of the commission appointed to inquire into Wolsey's possessions. He married twice: first, before 1510, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Huddesfield of Shillingford, Devon, with whom he had a son and heir, Nicholas; and second, by April 1527, Joan, widow of Sir Richard Guildford. He died between September 1532 and February 1533.<br>
