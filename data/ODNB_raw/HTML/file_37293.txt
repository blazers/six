<span class="headword">Clerke,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1572&#150;1596), <span class="occ">navigator and privateer</span>, claimed to have been born at Buckhurst, Essex, but is generally referred to as &#145;of Weymouth&#146;. He presumably learned his trade in the ships of the latter port, being master of the <i>Pilgrim</i> between Weymouth and Bordeaux in 1572. Part at least of the next ten years was evidently spent in the Newfoundland fishing trade, as he developed a specialist knowledge of the waters round that island. He entered the service of Henry Oughtred of Southampton, a major international merchant and shipowner. In command of Oughtred's <i>Susan Fortune</i> he accompanied the <i>Popinjay</i> of Sir John Perrot to Newfoundland in 1582. Oughtred claimed he had suffered losses in Spain and employed Clerke to help recover them from Spanish (in fact Portuguese) vessels in Newfoundland. At Fermeuse the two English vessels attacked and robbed three Portuguese vessels, lading their catch and goods into the <i>S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o</i>, which they brought back to Southampton, presumably dividing the returns between Perrot and Oughtred. Masters of English ships at Fermeuse were shocked at this disruption of a peaceful fishing community. The Portuguese took an action against Clerke in the high court of admiralty, supported by testimonies from an English ship's master who had been at Fermeuse, though no conclusion to the action has been found.<br>
<br>When, later in 1582, Sir Humphrey Gilbert was preparing an American colonizing expedition, Clerke entered his service and, between June and August 1583, served as master of his flagship, the <i>Delight</i>, first under William Winter as captain and then under Maurice Browne. The <i>Delight</i> met with opposition at St John's harbour from the mixed fishing community, but on sight of the queen's commission the squadron was admitted, and Gilbert went through the ceremony of annexing Newfoundland to England and issuing passes to non-English vessels to fish there. Clerke had a shallop built for exploration of the harbours of south-eastern Newfoundland, and fortunately it remained on tow when the ships left for the mainland. Off Sable Island&#151;Clerke maintained as the result of a changed order from Gilbert&#151;the <i>Delight</i> went aground, losing most of her men and all the data so far collected. Clerke bravely secured the shallop and with fifteen men contrived to sail northward to Newfoundland. Without stores or adequate sails they suffered great hardships, but eventually arrived in south-west Newfoundland, where Clerke knew the French Basques had fishing stations. They took his men, restored them to health, and brought them safely to Pasaje, where they were nearly taken by the Spanish, but eventually they reached England at the end of 1583 to find that Edward Hayes, whose <i>Golden Hind</i> was the only vessel to survive, accused Clerke of having cast away the <i>Delight</i>. Clerke made a technical and convincing reply, illustrating his knowledge of these waters. Richard Hakluyt printed both versions of the disaster in 1589.<br>
<br>Clerke presumably returned to the Newfoundland fishery, as he is not found in the Armada lists. He was still involved in the fishery in 1596, when he took the <i>Pilgrim</i> of Newport, Isle of Wight, into St John's harbour to purchase additional salt. He was received in a friendly fashion by the master of a French Basque ship of St Jean-de-Luz, who then turned on him, imprisoned him and his men, and stripped the <i>Pilgrim</i> of all but a minimum of food and sails. Clerke had to make his way home with such limited resources but succeeded in doing so successfully. He then fades out of the records.<br>
