<span class="headword">O'Connor,  James</span>  (1836&#150;1910), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born on 10 February 1836 in the Glen of Imaal, co. Wicklow, to Patrick O'Connor, a farmer, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kearney, of Donard in the same county. Following education at a local national school, he entered a commercial career and then was an early member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (Fenians). When its organ, the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, was established in 1863 with John O'Leary as editor, he joined the staff, working mainly as a bookkeeper though he seems to have had a limited aptitude for business. Along with other members of the newspaper when it was suppressed, O'Connor was arrested on 15 September 1865, convicted, and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. His incarceration was mainly in Millbank and Portland prisons and he was released in 1869 along with Charles Kickham, who later lived with O'Connor's family from November 1879 until his death on 22 August 1882. After his release O'Connor joined the staff of Richard Pigott's Fenian newspapers, becoming chief writer on <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> and editor of <span class="italic">The Shamrock</span>. Meanwhile he resumed work in the Irish Republican Brotherhood: a younger brother, John, was the long-time secretary of the supreme council and in 1870 James was an envoy to the Clan na Gael in the United States. He also attended the meeting at the Bilton Hotel in Dublin on 19 May 1870 at which the modern home rule movement was founded.<br>
<br>Initially O'Connor opposed the so-called &#145;new departure&#146; (1879) which linked Fenianism and Charles Stewart Parnell, but like many of his compatriots he drifted towards support of the land war (1879&#150;82), joining the Land League. When Pigott's newspapers were sold to a consortium headed by Parnell in mid-1881, he moved to the successor newspaper, <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>, as sub-editor. In December 1881 he was detained without trial under the <span class="roman">Protection of Person and Property Act</span> (1881) in Kilmainham gaol with Parnell and other leaders of the agrarian agitation, and he was released with them in mid-1882. He remained on <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> until December 1890, when he supported the anti-Parnellites and was ejected from his position. When rival journals were established in March 1891, O'Connor was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly National Press</span>. At the general election of 1892 he successfully stood as an anti-Parnellite for Wicklow County West, and he retained the seat (which was contested in 1895, 1900, and 1910) until his death at Kingstown, co. Dublin, on 12 March 1910.<br>
<br>O'Connor's first wife, Molly, with four of their children, died on 30 June 1890 from eating poisonous mussels at Monkstown, co. Dublin. He was survived by his second wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> McBride) and their daughter. After a funeral mass at St Michael's Roman Catholic Church, Kingstown, he was buried in Glasnevin cemetery alongside his first wife (14 March). A public monument was erected over their graves.<br>
