<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  William Brabazon</span>, first Baron Ponsonby  (1744&#150;1806), <span class="occ">politician and sportsman</span>, was born on 15 September 1744 in Dublin, the eldest of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22498/', "John Ponsonby (1713&#150;1789)")</script>, speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish (1723&#150;1796), second daughter of William Cavendish, third duke of Devonshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22495/', "George Ponsonby")</script>, later Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was his brother.<br>
<br>In the first half of the eighteenth century the Ponsonbys became one of the most powerful political families in Ireland, their modest personal electoral interests in co. Kilkenny and, after 1744, in Newtownards, co. Down, being bolstered by kinship with the dukes of Devonshire, who had extensive estates in counties Waterford and Cork. By the 1750s the Ponsonby connection, which had been formed out of a combination of personal, inherited and &#145;borrowed&#146; interests, constituted one of the &#145;undertakers&#146;&#151;the select group of Irish families who managed the Irish parliament on behalf of the British government.<br>
<br>Ponsonby entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1760 and in 1764 he was returned for Cork City to the Irish House of Commons; he continued to represent this constituency until the dissolution in 1776. He represented Bandon Bridge from 1776 until the general election of 1783 when, having been returned on the family interest both for Newtownards and co. Kilkenny, he chose to sit for co. Kilkenny, a seat he continued to represent until his elevation to the peerage in 1806. On 26 December 1769 he married Louisa Molesworth (1749&#150;1824), fourth daughter of Richard, third Viscount Molesworth, and his second wife, Mary Usher; they had five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22505/', "Sir William Ponsonby")</script>, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Throughout his parliamentary career Billy Ponsonby acted in conjunction with the rest of his family. Initially he was a beneficiary of his father's position on the revenue board and he was appointed examiner of customs. In 1770, however, he was a victim of Lord Townshend's dismantling of the undertaker system and, having accompanied his father in opposition, he was removed from his post. Some years later he and his family renewed their support for Dublin Castle under the viceroyalty of Lord Buckinghamshire; Ponsonby's own objectives were to be elected to the powerful speakership, vacated by his father in 1771, and, more generally, to defend the Irish protestant &eacute;lite in the political system. It was the latter cause that led him to oppose Henry Flood's <span class="roman">Parliamentary Reform Bill</span> on 29 November 1783.<br>
<br>Although the Ponsonbys were allies of the Rockingham whigs in 1782&#150;3&#151;Ponsonby was a relative of Rockingham's political heir, the duke of Portland&#151;they threw in their lot with Pitt in 1784. Ponsonby was appointed joint postmaster-general of Ireland and he became a member of the Irish privy council and the Irish linen board. He also gradually assumed the headship of the Ponsonby connection in the room of his ageing father, although the pleasures of hunting were a powerful distraction. However, neither the chase nor his official duties prevented him from opposing the Irish commercial propositions in 1785 or from even mounting an aborted campaign to be elected to the speakership of the Irish Commons on that ticket&#151;a desertion which Pitt felt strongly but which failed to lead to Ponsonby's dismissal and did not stand in the way of his obtaining the deputy governorship of co. Kilkenny in 1787. The fair-weather support of the Ponsonby group, which amounted to between ten and fourteen MPs and was the second largest in the Irish Commons, was evidently too important to the government.<br>
<br>In the regency crisis of 1788&#150;9 Ponsonby and his colleagues took the side of the prince against Pitt and Ponsonby was dismissed from the Post Office. At the end of the year Ponsonby's father died and he succeeded to the family estates. On this occasion the change of direction was permanent. He had been elected an original member of the Whig Club, founded in Dublin on 26 June 1789; and he and his brother George&#151;whom some regarded as the more effective leader of the family group&#151;aligned themselves with Fox and gathered together the various small groups of Irish whigs to form a party of systematic opposition under their own leadership. One of the party's first operations was another unsuccessful campaign to have Ponsonby elected speaker in 1790, a failure which his brother-in-law Lord Shannon attributed to Ponsonby's &#145;indolence and obstinacy&#146;  (Hewitt, 8). Moreover, although the circumstances were different, the ultimate objective of their leadership was similar to that of Fox and the English whigs&#151;to re-establish the political influence of the landowning classes and to diminish that of the crown. In 1793, 1794, and 1797 Ponsonby introduced measures of parliamentary reform with this objective in mind and he became committed to the necessity of Catholic relief in order to enable the protestant &eacute;lite to earn the credit and prolong its ascendancy.<br>
<br>Pitt's coalition with the Portland whigs in July 1794 and Earl Fitzwilliam's consequent appointment as lord lieutenant gave Ponsonby and his followers the opportunity they had been looking for since their humbling by Townshend in 1770. The chief beneficiary then had been John Beresford and it appears that it was Ponsonby who was instrumental in persuading Fitzwilliam to dismiss Beresford from his post as head of the revenue on the grounds of alleged corruption. This inaugurated a political crisis that led in 1795 to Fitzwilliam's recall, Beresford's re-instatement, and Ponsonby's humiliation. Thus, although he had been on the brink of becoming secretary of state and had sat ostentatiously on the Treasury bench, Ponsonby found himself in opposition once again and he apparently admitted that the case against Beresford was in essence more political than moral. As a consequence his enthusiasm for politics, like that of the Foxites in Britain, waned and he spent more time in the country. As he told Fitzwilliam on 29 May 1797, in words that reveal his deficiencies as a leader of the relatively new but by now demoralized party:<blockquote>You know I consider myself as an Irish country gentleman. I take no part in public affairs but when I think my good wishes to the country call upon me to do so, and I do so then without fear or expectation. (Jupp, 866)</blockquote>Ponsonby was a prominent opponent of the Union, but in his first speech as a Westminster MP he recommended that &#145;the wisest policy&#146; in the future was for British governments &#145;to treat the people of Ireland like the people of England&#146;  (Jupp, 866). In keeping with these assimilationist views he, three other Ponsonbys, and two of their relatives became part of the whig opposition, voting against the Addington and Pitt ministries and in favour of the prince of Wales and Catholic relief. It is a measure of his declining influence, however, that by 1803 Fox regarded Ponsonby's younger brother, George, as the spokesman for the Irish whigs. By the time the Foxites took office in 1806 his health was poor, with the result that his wife pressed his claims for a peerage, arguing that it was merited by the &#145;persecution&#146; that his family had suffered since the 1760s, by his &#145;formidable&#146; opposition to the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> and the Union, and by his staunch support for the Foxite whigs at Westminster  (ibid., 867). As a consequence he was raised swiftly to the British peerage on 13 March 1806 as Baron Ponsonby of Imokilly in the county of Cork. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 25 April, but never took part in the debates. He died in Seymour Street, Hyde Park, London, on 5 November 1806, and was buried in Ireland. His widow, who married on 21 July 1823 William Wentworth Fitzwilliam, died on 1 September 1824.<br>
<br>The rise and decline of the Ponsonbys after the 1730s was one of the more dramatic trajectories in the history of the Irish protestant &eacute;lite. Ponsonby himself must bear some of the responsibility for the downward movement. At a personal level he was as interested in sport as he was in politics and he was said to have kept &#145;the best hunting establishment in Ireland&#146; in Bishop's Court, his seat in co. Kildare, where it was also reported that he lived &#145;in the most hospitable and princely style&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 10.576). In addition, he was a man who was easily irritated, especially if his status and pretensions went unacknowledged. As A. P. W. Malcomson puts it: &#145;He seems to have been a man who sought to engross power, not to share it&#146;  (Malcomson, 403). Thus, although he played a part in creating a whig opposition in Ireland in the 1790s, he overplayed his hand in 1795 by trying to settle old scores, and then relapsed into intermittent and ineffective activity.<br>
