<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Robert</span>, baronet  (1860&#150;1938), <span class="occ">engineer and businessman</span>, was born on 21 January 1860 at Regent Quay, Aberdeen, one of seven children of William Williams (<i>bap</i>. 1822, <i>d</i>. 1866), whisky distiller, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of John Duthie, shipbuilder. After completing his time at the Gymnasium School, Old Aberdeen, Williams was apprenticed to the Aberdeen engineers Blaikie Brothers, where he was taught business and engineering design. He supplemented this training with evening classes at the Aberdeen Mechanics' Institute. In 1881 he was sent by Blaikie's to Kimberley's diamond fields in Africa. There he met Cecil Rhodes and rapidly established himself as a mining engineer. He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of Alexander Bayne, on 12 July 1886, at Kimberley Presbyterian Church. They had one son, who predeceased his father, and two daughters. Williams returned to Scotland with his wife, but after a brief period in the family distillery he returned to Africa, and again worked with Rhodes; they formed the Zambesia Exploring Company in 1891, to locate and develop mineral deposits in Southern Rhodesia. In 1895 the prince of Wales asked Rhodes to give a concession to one of his mistresses, Frances Evelyn Greville (&#145;Daisy&#146;), countess of Warwick. Some 6000 square miles of Northern Rhodesia were allocated, but financial disagreement and the Jameson raid halted development. The countess resumed negotiations, in 1898, which led to the formation in 1899 of Tanganyika Concessions Ltd (Tanks), of which Williams was managing director. At Lake Tanganyika, Tanks had on the southern shore a 2000 acre concession (which in fact was never developed) and responsibility for floating a steamer on the lake; the SS <i>Cecil Rhodes</i> was launched in October 1901.<br>
<br>By then George Grey, younger brother of Sir Edward Grey and a personal friend of Rhodes, had completed exploratory work for Williams in the area of Northern Rhodesia along Katanga's south-western border. Grey had absolutely no training as a geologist or mining engineer, but he was by no means unique in colonial Africa in that he was a younger member of a noble family who wanted some kind of job. His cousin, Albert Grey, later Earl Grey, governor-general of Canada, considered him &#145;Just a fine, plucky young Englishman full of refreshing honesty&#146;. Grey located the Kansanshi mine&#151;ultimately a better water well than a copper mine&#151;outside the limits of the area later known as the copperbelt. More significantly, Grey strayed into Katanga where he found the region's extensive copper deposits. Jules Cornet, a Belgian geologist, had considered development costs too high, but Williams's enthusiasm and willingness to shoulder the greater part of the initial financial burden overcame the reservations of King Leopold II and his colleagues. In 1906 the Union Mini&egrave;re du Haut-Katanga was formed to develop the new fields, with Tanks holding a 40 per cent stake; the remainder was held by Katanga's administering chartered company, the Comit&eacute; Special du Katanga. Williams was a vice-president of Union Mini&egrave;re and on its board of directors until his death.<br>
<br>To provide access to the coast, Williams, with Lady Warwick's help, secured a Portuguese concession to build a railway from Benguela, Angola, to the Katanga border in 1902, with the Portuguese government receiving a 10 per cent stake in the enterprise. The concession was taken over by the Companhia do Camino de Ferro de Benguela. Construction began in 1904 but was halted by the war in 1914 and only completed in 1931. A supposedly temporary expedient linked the mines to the existing, financially troubled Rhodesian rail network via the Chemin de fer du Katanga, and the Rhodesia&#150;Katanga Junction Railway, to the port of Beira in Mozambique. After the war, though the most difficult section of the line to construct had been completed, Williams found it difficult to raise further finance. He tried to secure a secondary guarantee of interest payments on Benguela Railway Company debentures from the British government under the terms of the 1921 <span class="roman">Trade Facilities Act</span> intended to help alleviate unemployment in Britain. This met with strong opposition from General Smuts, South Africa's prime minister, who considered the Benguela railway a threat to the Rhodesian railway system at a time when he hoped to persuade that colony's white settlers to become part of the Union of South Africa. Construction could only proceed slowly until white settlers voted for responsible self-government in 1923, and Smuts was voted out of office in 1924, opening the way for government support, but only on the basis of a prior guarantee of debenture interest from Tanks. The line was completed to the border in 1928. In the same year the Chemin de fer du Bas-Congo au Katanga (BCK) reached its terminus and became the politically preferred line for Katanga traffic; it was subsidized to protect its position, even after the Benguela line was finally linked to the mines in 1931.<br>
<br>Largely because the Benguela Railway never carried the large volume of Katanga traffic on which its profitability depended, Tanks was forced to provide considerable financial support. So great were the Benguela railway's demands that, as Union Mini&egrave;re expanded, Tanks was unable to sustain its 40 per cent investment in the company, and the figure fell to 14.5 per cent. Although the completed Benguela route did not fulfil its original purpose, it did serve as an important supply line during the Second World War and as a basis for mineral and commercial development in Angola; this was never sufficient to compensate. Williams was considered, not without justification, something of a visionary or romantic idealist, seeing the Benguela railway as a spectacular means of opening and developing Africa's interior, with himself as a major figure in that development, the man on whose shoulders the &#145;mantle of Rhodes&#146; had settled. His commitment to the railway bordered on the obsessive, and he seemed totally unable to appreciate either the political conflicts or the competing economic pressures which ensured that the BCK and Rhodesia Railways would continue to be the preferred access routes for Katanga. Tanks's corporate health would certainly have benefited if Williams had abandoned the Benguela line after 1918. His attitude towards Africans was paternalistic at best, not unlike many other Europeans linked to imperial expansion in Africa.<br>
<br>Throughout his business career Williams, like most businessmen involved in exploiting Africa's human and mineral resources, spent the greater part of his time in Europe. He was a well-known figure in London's West End, where he entertained royally and frequented the theatre. Following the First World War he was able to fulfil a long-time ambition by acquiring Park House, a late-Georgian mansion on the River Dee at Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, with fishing rights and several hundred acres of farmland. As he grew older he spent an increasing proportion of his time there. His special philanthropic interest was Aberdeen's hospital. Williams was granted the freedom of the city of Aberdeen, and he was created a baronet in 1928. He also became a grand officer of the order of the Crown and commander of the royal order of the Lion of Belgium and a knight commander of the Portuguese order of Christ. The Angolan town of Ca&aacute;la was renamed Vila Robert Williams.<br>
<br>Accompanied by his wife, Williams made a last tour of Africa in 1934. After two minor operations and gently declining health, he died at his Deeside home, Park House, Drumoak, on 25 April 1938 and was buried two days later at Drumoak parish church. He was survived by his wife.<br>
