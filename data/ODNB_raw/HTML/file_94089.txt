<span class="headword">Younger,  Alan Christopher Wyrill</span>  (1933&#150;2004), <span class="occ">stained-glass artist</span>, was born on 13 March 1933 at 3 Princes Garth, Forest Hill, London, the second son of Henry Walter Younger, a provision buyer for the food retailer Sainsbury &amp; Co., and his wife, Elizabeth Blakemore, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wyrill. He was educated at Alleyn's School in nearby Dulwich and at Rossall in Lancashire, where the school was evacuated during the war. His national service years were spent in Egypt and there his prowess at cricket earned him a place in the Combined Forces Mediterranean team. After leaving the army in 1953 he enrolled part-time at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in Holborn, London. There memorable life-drawing classes were taught by Mervyn Peake. To earn a living Younger worked for the stained-glass artist Carl Edwards at his studio in the old mortuary above the Apothecaries Hall in Blackfriars. Younger researched coats of arms and historical detail as well as technical data needed by Edwards in the creation of new windows for war-damaged buildings including Liverpool's Anglican cathedral and the House of Lords. Six years spent in this way gave Younger invaluable experience in learning the techniques required to make stained-glass windows to a high professional standard. His first window was made under Edwards's supervision for the stairwell of the Temple Church, near Fleet Street.<br>
<br>On 8 November 1957 Younger married (Hazel) Zo&euml; Evans, a secretary and the 27-year-old daughter of Leslie Birchmore, a coalmining trainer. The couple moved to Forest Hill to a flat on Taymount Rise where their two daughters were born, Louise Sarah in 1958 and Johanna Elizabeth in 1963. In 1959 Younger left Carl Edwards to join the studio in Penshurst, Kent, of Lawrence Lee, professor of stained glass at the Royal College of Art. Lee had many commissions following the resounding success of his stained-glass windows in the nave of the recently completed Coventry Cathedral. Younger proved an ideal assistant while Lee encouraged him to adopt a looser, more spontaneous, approach to working on glass which undoubtedly extended his visual vocabulary. Meanwhile Younger's own work was taking shape. In 1961 he won the Worshipful Company of Glaziers' prize and in 1962 was awarded the Sir Arthur Evans travelling scholarship, which enabled him and his family to tour France and Germany studying the work of contemporary glass artists as well as the continental heritage of medieval stained glass. His first two commissions were east windows: Haselbech church in Northamptonshire (1966) and Boldre church in Hampshire (1967). His individual approach to design was immediately apparent in the deployment of varied textures on white and coloured glass, his concern for the orchestration of the lead line within the composition, and his passionate attention to detail.<br>
<br>In 1969 the family bought a house, 44 Belvedere Road, near Crystal Palace, London. A studio was built in the garden with a north-facing window, workbench, and kiln. In this confined space Younger designed his windows, assembled the glass and cut out the shapes, and painted, stained, and fired the glass pieces. The only part of the process assigned to others was the glazing and fixing of the windows into the building. Demand for Younger's stained glass was now considerable as church clients responded to his charm, evident depth of knowledge, and the beauty of the finished windows. Significant commissions from this period include the Bede window in the Galilee chapel of Durham Cathedral (installed 1973); among his other church commissions were windows for Tamworth parish church, Glasgow university chapel, the Suzy Lamplugh memorial window at All Saints', East Sheen, London, two memorial windows for field marshals James Cassels and Mike Carver at the Royal Military Academy chapel, Sandhurst, and a lancet window at St Aldhelm's chapel, Worth Matravers, Dorset. Younger's competence as an architectural designer also brought him to the notice of organizations besides the church. During the 1980s the decorative glass makers Goddard and Gibbs sought artists who were able to offer contemporary interpretations of Arabic patterns for the decoration of mosques, palaces, and airports in the Middle East. With great sensitivity Younger designed windows for royal pavilions, private villas, and mosques in Saudi Arabia while the Queen Mother Marriage Hall, Kuwait, was an outstanding example of his work in this field. In Britain his secular commissions included windows for St John's College, Cambridge, and University College, Oxford, and two entrance panels for Putney shopping centre.<br>
<br>In September 1987 Younger was invited to create new glass for the rose window at St Albans Cathedral to replace that installed during Lord Grimthorpe's late nineteenth-century rebuilding of the north transept. Completed in 1989 and dedicated by Diana, princess of Wales, the new window was a resounding success. Dramatic colour and a well worked out mathematical design made this one of the few modern rose windows to compare favourably with those of the middle ages. Other prestigious commissions followed. In 1993 Younger made three windows for Chester Cathedral, commissioned by the duke of Westminster, while in 1998 he won the competition to create new glass for the clerestory east window of Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey. Looking back over this demanding work&#151;which depicts the Virgin Mary and angels and took two years to complete&#151;Younger wrote:<blockquote>I was in complete agreement that the window should be figurative but did not want this element to dominate and be immediately apparent. A window that revealed its content slowly after a first impression of abstraction and rich jewel like colour, with an important ration of &#145;whites&#146;, in the manner of 15th century English glass would be preferable, endeavouring to convey a feeling that the glass had always been in that position and &#145;belonged&#146; to the chapel, but at the same time was undoubtedly of &#145;today&#146;. (Younger, &#145;Glazing the clerestory&#146;)</blockquote>This window was installed in October 2000 and was his last major work. Another rose window, for St Katherine's Foundation in Rotherhithe, had been designed before Younger was diagnosed with cancer in early 2004; it was completed after his death by his friend the glass artist Caroline Benyon, daughter of Carl Edwards, and her husband, Tony Benyon. Besides his glasswork Younger was a lively and much loved teacher at Kingsdale School, the pioneering comprehensive in West Dulwich. From 1971 he also lectured in art history and life drawing at the American International University at Richmond. A member of the Art-Workers' Guild and liveryman of the Company of Glaziers, he was also an active fellow and vice-president of the British Society of Master Glass Painters and a much-valued trustee of the Stained Glass Museum, Ely. He died at his home in south London on 12 May 2004 and was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
