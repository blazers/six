<span class="headword">Gruffudd ap Llywelyn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1063), <span class="occ">king of Gwynedd and of Deheubarth</span>, was an aggressive and powerful ruler of Gwynedd from 1039 to 1063 and, after a series of attempts to secure the south, he ruled Deheubarth from 1055 until his death.<br>
<br>Gruffudd's father, <a name="cosubject_16873"></a><span class="headword">Llywelyn ap Seisyll</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1023)<span class="occ"></span>, was a man of obscure parentage. While Seisyll cannot be linked with any known lineage, later genealogies suggest that Llywelyn's mother was Prawst, a descendant of Rhodri Mawr of Gwynedd (844&#150;878). Llywelyn himself married into the ruling dynasty of Deheubarth; his wife, Angharad, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18040/', "Maredudd ab Owain")</script> (<i>r</i>. 986&#150;99). The brief record of his career shows him to have been active in north and south Wales. In the north, in 1017 or 1018, he defeated and killed Aeddan ap Blegywryd, who has been identified as a usurper seeking to rule Gwynedd, or (since his name does not occur in any royal genealogy) as a powerful local figure who had to be won over or subdued by any legitimate claimant. From 1018 Llywelyn was ruler of Gwynedd. In south Wales an Irish adventurer, Rhain, claiming to be a son of Maredudd ab Owain, seemed likely to establish himself as the ruling prince until Llywelyn defeated him in battle at Abergwili in 1022. The sources do not establish whether Llywelyn was then acting as a representative of the southern dynasty of Hywel Dda, or as an aggressive ruler of the northern kingdom pursuing ambitions in Deheubarth. In what was clearly a year of crisis, each version of the <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> records a flattering encomium of his quality.<br>
<br>His death in 1023, which was noted without further comment, marked a temporary eclipse of his dynasty. In that year the old line of Gwynedd was re-established when Iago ab Idwal became ruler. He held power until he was killed and replaced by Gruffudd ap Llywelyn in 1039. Writing many years later, in the 1180s, Walter Map drew on border traditions and presented Gruffudd growing up as a spineless youth, lacking in confidence and drive. His sister, seeking to urge him to action, reproached him, as the only son and heir of his father, for his lack of purpose. By 1039 that phase had passed. Gruffudd may have been, as the <span class="italic">Brenhinedd y Saesson</span> claims, responsible for the death of Iago. Certainly, as soon as he became king of Gwynedd, Gruffudd was involved in battle with the men of Mercia whom he defeated at Rhyd-y-groes on the Severn. Whether he or the Mercians took the initiative in seeking that encounter is not known. For the next sixteen years his main objective was to make himself master of Deheubarth, but he was thwarted by the resilience and resistance of the two princes ruling south Wales, Hywel ab Edwin, between 1039 and 1044, and Gruffudd ap Rhydderch, between 1044 and 1055. Twice, in 1039 and 1041, he defeated Hywel but failed to take his kingdom. In 1041, after the battle of Pencader, he captured Hywel's wife and &#145;took her as his own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, 13). He was himself captured by a Scandinavian force in 1042. Hywel made alliance with the Scandinavians&#151;the Ostmen&#151;based in Ireland, but, as the <span class="italic">Brut</span> makes clear, Gruffudd overcame them and finally defeated and killed Hywel in 1044. He could not prevent Gruffudd ap Rhydderch from establishing himself as king in Hywel's place.<br>
<br>There was heavy fighting between the northern king and Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and his brother, Rhys, in 1045. In the following year Gruffudd ap Llywelyn allied with an English earl, Swein son of Godwine, and they campaigned together in Wales. It is generally assumed that this alliance was an attempt to dislodge his rival in the south. The struggle for power was checked by a crisis, little short of a disaster, within Wales. The men of Ystrad Tywi attacked Gruffudd ap Llywelyn's bodyguard&#151;his <i>teulu</i>&#151;and about 140 of them were killed. It was a great loss: Gruffudd had the strength to seek revenge in Ystrad Tywi, but not to renew hostilities on a large scale, and the southern prince was left undisturbed for a number of years. A raid on Herefordshire in 1052, extending as far as Leominster, was attributed to him by John of Worcester; it remains inherently unlikely, though John's claim cannot lightly be put aside. With the deaths of Rhys ap Rhydderch in 1053 and of Gruffudd ap Rhydderch in 1055, the southern kingdom could not produce a strong candidate, and Gruffudd ap Llywelyn could establish himself as ruler of Wales.<br>
<br>From 1055 to 1063 Gruffudd was primarily concerned with relations with England. His policy was, in part, a continuation of the aggressive policy pursued on the English frontier by Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and, in part, a reaction to political events in England. In 1055 &AElig;lfgar, son of Leofric, earl of Mercia, was forced into exile in the course of a power struggle between the earls of Wessex and Mercia. &AElig;lfgar countered by recruiting a fleet from the Scandinavians settled in Ireland and by forming an alliance with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, who was the most prominent leader of the combined force. The defence of the southern frontier had been entrusted to Ralph de Mantes, earl of Hereford, who relied on castles and knights, on the continental pattern. When the attack came the English defence collapsed and Ralph's army suffered heavy casualties. Hereford was taken; the town and its cathedral were destroyed by fire, and Gruffudd returned to Wales with substantial plunder. Reinforcements were brought from all over England under Harold, earl of Wessex, but he was content to refortify Hereford, and to negotiate at Billingsley peace terms which, all too soon, were compromised. Leofgar, the new bishop of Hereford, one of Harold's clerical followers, was secular and belligerent in outlook. In June, 1056, he led an army against Gruffudd, and was soundly defeated, again with heavy losses.<br>
<br>His action put Earl Harold's integrity at risk, and peace was restored only by calling on Earl Leofric and Ealdred, bishop of Worcester, and ultimately on King Edward. Despite his military dominance, Gruffudd accepted by a formal oath that he would be a faithful under-king, perhaps content with recognition by the English of his territorial and other acquisitions. Walter Map recorded an anecdote which demonstrates a generous trait in Gruffudd's character. The two rulers faced each other on opposite banks of the Severn, waiting for the other to make the first move. When Edward the Confessor set out from Aust in a small boat, Gruffudd leapt into the river to meet him and carried him on his shoulders to the shore. The Mercian&#150;Welsh alliance was strengthened by a marriage between Gruffudd and Edith [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/307/', "Ealdgyth")</script>], daughter of Earl &AElig;lfgar. It was called into action again in 1058, when &AElig;lfgar and Gruffudd were once more linked with a Norwegian fleet, but the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> does not make explicit the cause or the development of this obscure episode.<br>
<br>Nor are the events of 1062 wholly clear. Earl &AElig;lfgar was the recipient of a royal writ late in the summer of 1062, and apparently died soon afterwards. At Christmas, Earl Harold was sent on a surprise attack on Gruffudd's court at Rhuddlan, but the prince escaped by sea. A campaign and blockade mounted in the summer of 1063 by Earl Harold and Earl Tostig left him with less hope of survival. He moved inland, and was killed in August by enemies in Wales. His head was taken to Earl Harold, and ultimately delivered to Edward the Confessor. Gwynedd and Powys were given to his half-brothers, Bleddyn and Rhiwallon, who ruled as client kings, and in the south the old dynasty of Deheubarth was restored.<br>
<br>Of his family little is known. He had a liaison with the wife of Hywel ab Edwin, taken as part of the spoils of war in 1041. He married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/307/', "Ealdgyth")</script>, daughter of Earl &AElig;lfgar, and they had a daughter, later the wife of Osbern fitz Richard; their daughter married another marcher lord, Bernard de Neufmarch&eacute;. Walter Map wrote of a wife of great beauty whom Gruffudd loved; that may be a reference to Ealdgyth, noted for her beauty. No sons were recorded in any genealogy, but two sons are named in chronicle sources, Maredudd and Ithel (<i>recte</i> Idwal), both of whom died in 1069. An Owain ap Gruffudd who died ten years earlier may have been a third son.<br>
<br>Gruffudd's reign was important for Wales. Territorial gains which he had made along the northern frontier as far as Bistre, (Bishopstree, near Mold), and which he and Gruffudd ap Rhydderch had made in the south, extended Welsh rule eastwards. He had a court poet, Berddig, who was given three rills, with five plough teams in Gwent. There were substantial losses after his final defeat and death. His alliance with Mercia gave him greater influence in English affairs than any other Welsh ruler of the eleventh century. In terms of English domestic politics it also made him a dangerous figure in the eyes of the earls of Wessex and Northumbria, and for that he eventually paid a heavy price. He gave Wales unity for a brief eight years. When the writer of the <span class="italic">Brut</span> praised him as &#145;the head and shield of the Britons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, 15), he was looking at the past. At no point in Gruffudd's reign could the possibility of the succession of a Norman king in England be identified as a future problem for Welsh princes. He disappeared from the scene before the Norman invasion of England in 1066 produced new and potentially dangerous problems for Wales. When that threat emerged, the country had returned once more to its traditional pattern of multiple kingship and disruptive rivalries.<br>
