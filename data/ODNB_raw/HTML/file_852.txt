<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Matthew</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Paul of St Francis]</span>  (1656&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar</span>, was born in Yorkshire and entered the Franciscan order on 27 December 1673 at St Bonaventure's Franciscan College, Douai, where he had been educated. He took the name Paul of St Francis. After ordination he lectured in philosophy and theology. Relieved of teaching because of failing eyesight and ill health, he was sent on the English mission in 1687, joining the friary in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He became prefect of choir, novice master, and, finally, definitor.<br>
<br>The friars dispersed in 1688 after attacks on their house by the mob following the landing of William of Orange. Two were imprisoned but Atkinson zealously continued his pastoral work in London for twelve years until the bishop of London had him arrested. On 28 August 1700 he was convicted at the Middlesex sessions for exercising the function of a popish priest by hearing the confession of Elizabeth Rich and absolving her contrary to the statute lately made, <span class="roman">An Act for Further Preventing the Growth of Popery</span> (II Will. 3.c.4). She testified that she had been an apprentice with a family living in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields who were Roman Catholics and that she had been &#145;perverted to the Romish Church by two Popish priests, Cornwall and Atkinson&#146;. Atkinson was sentenced to perpetual life imprisonment and committed to Newgate prison. There he began to convert his fellow prisoners, to the alarm of the bishop, who had him transferred to Hurst Castle on the Solent, facing the Isle of Wight, lately designated to be the prison for &#145;every Popish Bishop, Priest, Jesuit or other Papist&#146; condemned to perpetual life imprisonment. In the event he was the only one ever confined there. He arrived on 3 October 1700. At first he was treated leniently by the governor. According to local tradition, he was able to move about the neighbourhood and even to educate some local children. He was said to have lived there with cheerful composure, beloved and respected by the keeper of the castle and the whole neighbourhood as an unfortunate, amiable man, until some strangers, who happened to visit Hurst, complained to the authorities about the governor's indulgence and, to avoid causing him further trouble, Atkinson retired to his miserable cell and did not go out again.<br>
<br>Several unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain Atkinson's release, notably by the French ambassador, the duc d'Aumont. In the thirtieth year of his imprisonment he became ill owing to the dampness of his prison and the raw sea air and he died on 15 October 1729. His body was brought to Winchester by members of the Catholic nobility, who came from all parts of the country. There he was laid to rest in the ancient Catholic cemetery of St James, Romsey Road, Winchester, perhaps the last man in England to suffer perpetual life imprisonment for exercising the function of a Catholic priest. His gravestone has a Latin inscription which, translated, reads: &#145;Here is buried Reverend Paul Atkinson, Franciscan, who, on October 15<sup>th</sup>, 1729, in the 74<sup>th</sup> year of his age, died in Hurst Castle, having been a prisoner there for thirty years. Rest in peace&#146;.<br>
