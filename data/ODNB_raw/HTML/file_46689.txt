<span class="headword">Buchanan,  James</span>  (1784&#150;1857), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 10 March 1784. Nothing is known of his ancestry or early life. He married twice. With his first wife, whose name is not known, he had a son, William. He married his second wife, Isabella Anderson, in Edinburgh and was living at Haddington in 1812 when his son Ebenezer was born. A weaver by trade and a Primitive Methodist lay preacher, he served in the militia in Scotland during the Napoleonic war, moving to New Lanark in June 1814 to obtain employment in the recently opened mills.<br>
<br>Buchanan's association with Robert Owen began in January 1816 when the Institution for the Formation of Character was opened and he became the first master in a &#145;rational infant school&#146;. This day school for children aged between two and six was an integral part of the system, which included evening classes for older children and adults. Kindness was all-important, corporal punishment was forbidden, and competition had no place. Buchanan received specific instructions from Owen on many aspects of child education and evolved his own approach with emphasis on music, marching, movement, gymnastics, and concern for moral welfare. In 1819 Buchanan was recruited by Henry Brougham to open the first infant day school in England (the Westminster Free Day Infant Asylum), &#145;according to Mr. Owen's Plan&#146;, at 23 Brewers Green, later moving to Carey Street, Vincent Square, Westminster. The original school was administered by a committee representing mainly whig, radical, and nonconformist interests, charging no fees and relying solely on private philanthropy; but by 1824 a weekly fee of 1<i>d</i>. was charged, substantially less than the fees then current in dame-schools and child-minding establishments.<br>
<br>Buchanan's methods, predominantly personal, reflected the view that moral education was as important as basic subjects in the curriculum for working-class children. An excellent storyteller, he encouraged children's self-expression during simple object lessons when they did most of the talking, learning to observe and describe. Such interaction between teacher and child differed from the usual monitorial school relationships and impressed numerous influential visitors to Westminster, which served as a model for other infant schools. Contemporaries recalled that he never grew up, was simple-hearted and natural with a child's power to imagine and dramatize. Mystical, eccentric, completely unpractical, he was unable to cope with everyday school activities without the assistance of his wife, who was responsible for maintaining basic standards of behaviour and cleanliness.<br>
<br>Buchanan was an active member of the New Jerusalem Church based on Emanuel Swedenborg's doctrines which endorsed the innocence of infancy and believed knowledge was derived from the senses. Samuel Wilderspin, who opened Spitalfields infant school in 1820, and David Goyder, master of Bristol Meadow Street infant school in 1821, both Swedenborgians, frequently visited Buchanan's school and acknowledged his influence on infant school methodology which they subsequently developed and publicized. Thomas Bilby, another prot&eacute;g&eacute;, who taught at Vincent Square, opened infant schools in Chelsea and the West Indies and published <span class="italic">The Infant Teacher's Assistant</span> in 1831.<br>
<br>Buchanan conducted the London infant school, with the assistance of his wife and daughter Anne, for almost twenty years, with only a year's absence in 1826 when he established an infant school at Crich in Derbyshire. In 1839 he accepted an invitation from the New Zealand Land Company to promote infant schools but on reaching Cape Town, where his eldest son was living, he was persuaded to stay and was joined by his wife and daughter. Buchanan continued to support infant school development, moved to Natal in 1856 to join his sons, and died in Pietermaritzburg on 14 January 1857.<br>
