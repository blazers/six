<span class="headword">Latey,  Gilbert</span>  (1626&#150;1705), <span class="occ">Quaker activist</span>, was born at St Issey, Cornwall, in February 1626, and was baptized there on 20 March. He was the youngest son of John Latey, a prosperous yeoman, maltster, and innkeeper. His mother, whose maiden name was Hocking, was &#145;a gentlewoman born&#146; and came &#145;of the best family then in the parish&#146;  (Hawkins, 2); her brother married a sister of Charles I's attorney-general Sir William Noy. Latey served his apprenticeship to a tailor and then worked in Plymouth but left his employment owing to doubts about his master's religious sincerity. In November 1648 he arrived in London and soon set up business as a tailor in the Strand. His nephew and biographer, Richard Hawkins, noted that &#145;he grew into great reputation in the world &hellip; being employed and respected by persons of the first rank and quality&#146;  (ibid., 4).<br>
<br>In 1654 Latey was attending four sermons a day but was disturbed by religious doubts, for &#145;his mind and desires were still to find peace with the Lord&#146; and so he remained in a &#145;seeking condition&#146;  (Hawkins, 4). He was convinced of the Quaker message at the house of Sarah Matthews, a widow in Whitecross Street, after hearing Edward Burrough speak. He at once joined the movement and shortly became one of its most influential members in London, testifying about 1659 against the schismatic John Perrot. As a result of his new beliefs he refused to make coats superfluously adorned with lace and ribbon and &#145;came under a conscientious concern not to meddle therein &hellip; which made some say he was mad&#146;  (Hawkins, 19). Latey discussed his objections in the tract <span class="italic">To All You Taylors and Brokers who Lyes in Wickedness</span> (1660) in which he remarked that &#145;people look like apes and fools&#146; rather than &#145;sober men and women&#146; and deprecated such practices as the bedecking of servants in liveries  (ibid., 45&#150;6). As a consequence most of his wealthy customers left him, and his trade, which had been prosperous, for a time declined, so that he had to release his servants and go and &#145;work at day labour for his bread&#146;  (ibid., 20).<br>
<br>In 1659 Latey went to St Dunstan's Church, Fleet Street, and after the sermon openly charged the preacher, the presbyterian Thomas Manton, to prove his doctrine. As the congregation came to &#145;a fermentation&#146; a constable was sent for and Latey was taken before a magistrate. The latter told him that Manton was a very learned man and could doubtless give scriptural proof for what he said; according to his nephew, Latey replied &#145;that was all he desired, but could not obtain&#146;  (Hawkins, 24&#150;5). The magistrate then dismissed him with the remark that he had understood the Quakers to be &#145;mad, whimsical folks&#146; but that Latey seemed rational enough  (ibid., 26). Soon afterwards Latey and about sixteen others were thrown into a small dungeon at the Gatehouse, Westminster, for meeting together. The cell was dark and only 10 feet by 11, which meant that they had to take turns to lie down. Latey afterwards succeeded in proving charges of cruelty and extortion against Wickes, the master of the prison.<br>
<br>Following his release Latey signed the petition of 600 Friends, presented through Sir John Glanville, that they might lie body for body in place of those already in prison, though the request was refused. About 1660 Latey and George Fox attempted to arrange the release of two female Quakers from prison in Malta and the former took the matter up with Lord d'Aubigny, lord almoner to the queen mother. On one visit he was invited to her chapel and &#145;the power of the Lord worked so much on Gilbert, that he stepped up on &hellip; a private altar, and the word of the Lord came to him to preach truth&#146;  (Hawkins, 54). He continued to visit d'Aubigny who eventually secured the women's release.<br>
<br>Latey constantly visited the numerous meetings in and around London, at Kingston, Hammersmith, Barking, and Greenwich. While riding to Greenwich on one occasion he was stoned by a mob. In 1661 he was taken by a party of the King's foot guards from a meeting in Palace Yard, Westminster, and confined under the Banqueting House in Whitehall. He was again arrested at the end of 1662 for being present at a meeting in the home of Elizabeth Trot in Pall Mall, where the Quakers continued to meet until 1666 when they moved to Westminster.<br>
<br>By the 1660s it would appear that Latey was taking an important role in the affairs of the central Quaker meetings. In 1668 he was one of the keepers of the society's national stock and remained so until 1682. He was frequently chosen to represent the society regarding sufferings and often did so with George Whitehead, who described Latey as his &#145;true companion in laborious solicitations&#146; on behalf of Friends  (George Whitehead's testimony concerning Gilbert Latey, in Hawkins, sig. A5). In 1663, for example, Whitehead procured, after a personal appeal to Charles II, the release of sixty-three Quakers imprisoned at Norwich and the remission of their fines. During the plague of 1665 Latey was in constant attendance on the sick, distributing money collected among the Friends, particularly to those confined to houses in the parishes outside Temple Bar. He caught the infection himself in October but, as he told Margaret Fell, &#145;the Lord was good unto him, and, having further service for him to do, raised him up again&#146;  (Braithwaite, <span class="italic">Second</span>, 48). In September 1670 he held meetings in Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, but on learning that Sir John Robinson, governor of the Tower of London, had given orders for the pulling down of several meeting-houses in London, Latey hurried back and managed to prevent the demolition of the one in Wheeler Street to which he held the title. In 1671 Latey was arrested and fined for preaching at Hammersmith in spite of the warning of his patron, Sir William Sawkell, that he had orders to arrest all who should be present.<br>
<br>On 23 March 1674 Latey married Mary Fielder (<i>d</i>. 1714), only daughter of John and Ann Fielder of Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. They had eleven children, most of whom died at an early age; certainly only their daughters Sarah and Mary appear as beneficiaries in Latey's will of 1705. Mary Latey gave a picture of her husband's character in a testimony to him, writing that &#145;he was a man given up to serve God, and his people, never sparing himself to do what good he could&#146;  (M. Latey, &#145;A testimony concerning my dear and well-beloved husband Gilbert Latey&#146;, in Hawkins, sig. A).<br>
<br>Latey was a key member of the meeting for sufferings, which met weekly from 1676. In 1679 he again went by Bath and Bristol to Cornwall where he visited Thomas Lamplugh, bishop of Exeter, hoping to moderate the persecution of Friends in the west country, a venture which, judging by a letter from the bishop of March 1684, appears to have been successful. On behalf of the meeting for sufferings Latey attended Charles II on many occasions, for example at Hampton Court in 1683, where he discussed the plight of prisoners in Norwich as well as Quaker customs such as the refusal of hat honour. Soon after the accession of James II, Latey and Whitehead, who had always been well received at court under his brother, induced the new king after long attendance at Whitehall to order the release from prison of 1500 Friends and to remit their fines of &pound;20 a month for non-attendance at church. Subsequent interviews with James led to the discharging of other Friends in Bristol and elsewhere and, in 1686, to the restoration of meeting-houses at the Savoy and at Southwark which had been seized as guardhouses for the king. Latey's house at the Savoy communicated with the meeting-house by a stone passage and flight of steps. In December 1687 a third visit paid by Latey and Whitehead to the king was followed by another proclamation of pardon. With William and Mary, Latey's personal influence was exerted no less successfully. On their accession he presented an address on behalf of a hundred Quakers, most of whom were in prison for refusing the oath of allegiance, and was successful in securing their release. It was owing to Latey's and Whitehead's personal and persistent applications at court that parliament passed the act in 1696 by which the Quaker affirmation became acceptable instead of an oath, an act which was made perpetual in 1715.<br>
<br>A number of character testimonies exist for Latey, including that from his nephew and biographer, Richard Hawkins, who wrote that &#145;His parts were quick, and his apprehension lively; his memory good, and his judgement sound and strong; his example shining in self-denial; yet he was of a generous and free spirit&#146;  (R. Hawkins, &#145;The testimony of Richard Hawkins concerning &hellip; Gilbert Latey&#146;, in Hawkins, unpaginated). An unnamed &#145;very eminent Friend&#146; said of Latey that &#145;of all the men, among Friends, that he ever knew or heard of, he never followed a man that had a sweeter character&#146;  (Hawkins, 154). Being mostly involved in organizational affairs, Latey apparently had little time for writing. Apart from his tract of 1660 he contributed to <span class="italic">A Salutation or Testimony of True and Brotherly Love</span> (1672) and was a signatory to Edward Burrough's <span class="italic">A Declaration from the People called Quakers</span> (1659).<br>
<br>Latey continued to preach at Hammersmith and elsewhere until his death there from consumption on 15 November 1705; he was buried at Kingston upon Thames on 20 November. His widow died eight years later, on 18 February 1714.<br>
