<span class="headword">Paneth,  Friedrich Adolf</span>  (1887&#150;1958), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 31 August 1887 in Vienna, the second of the three sons of Joseph Paneth, a distinguished physiologist, and his wife, Sophie Schwab, the daughter of a leading industrialist. His mother was unusually well educated, and had a strong interest in the natural sciences and philosophy. Both his parents were of Jewish descent but he and his two brothers were brought up as protestants. He was educated at the Schotten Gymnasium and the University of Vienna. He then studied for a year under Adolph von Baeyer (1835&#150;1917) in Munich before returning to Vienna to obtain his PhD in 1910.<br>
<br>As a research student Paneth worked on organic chemistry, but his interests changed when in 1912 he became assistant to Stefan Meyer in the recently established Radium Research Institute attached to the Vienna Academy of Science. The institute rapidly became a leading international centre for the study of radioactivity; after his five years there Paneth remained an inorganic chemist for the rest of his life. On 6 December 1913 he married Else Hartmann, daughter of the distinguished medieval historian Ludo Moritz Hartmann (1865&#150;1924), who served as Austrian ambassador in Berlin after the First World War. She was a doctor of medicine and practised in Vienna and later in Edinburgh. They had two children, Eva and Heinrich Rudolf, the latter of whom, known generally under the name Heinz Post, became a distinguished philosopher of science. In 1917 Paneth joined the Deutsche Technische Hochschule at Prague, and two years later he went as assistant professor to the University of Hamburg. In 1922 he became head of the inorganic department of the Chemical Institute of the University of Berlin. In 1929 he received a call to become a full professor at the University of K&ouml;nigsberg and was also made head of the chemical institute there, an unusual distinction for an inorganic chemist.<br>
<br>When Hitler came to power in 1933 Paneth was on a lecture tour in Britain and decided to remain as a guest lecturer at the Imperial College of Science and Technology. In 1938 he was appointed reader in atomic chemistry at the University of London. In 1939 he was invited to the chair of chemistry at Durham. In 1943&#150;5 he was in charge of the chemistry division of the joint British&#150;Canadian atomic energy team in Montreal. In addition to his long experience in radioactivity studies, staff at Montreal also appreciated his efforts to inject &#145;an element of old world courtesy and culture&#146;  (Emel&eacute;us, 229) into the often tense atmosphere of wartime research. After the war he returned to Durham where he established the Londonderry Laboratory for Radiochemistry and resumed his former researches. When he reached the age of retirement in 1953 he accepted an invitation to become director of the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry in Mainz where the last five years of his life were spent in building up an active research school.<br>
<br>One of Paneth's first pieces of research was an unsuccessful attempt to separate radium <i>D</i> from radiolead. George Hevesy was engaged in a similar attempt in Manchester and the results of their investigations, which proved negative, were published in a joint paper in 1913. The consequent probability that radium <i>D</i> was inseparable from lead was immediately put to use. Early in January 1913 the first joint investigation with radioactive tracers was carried out in the study of the solubility of lead sulphide and lead chromate; labelled lead and bismuth were also used in electrochemical studies. In the ensuing years Paneth carried out several important studies applying radium <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> and thorium <i>B</i> as tracers. One of these was the study of adsorption of Th<i>B</i>, Th<i>C</i>, and Ra on such compounds as titanium, chromium and manganese oxides, barium sulphate and chromate, and the silver halides. Adsorption was strong when the radioelements formed an insoluble compound with the electronegative component of the adsorbing material. This work was embodied in <span class="italic">Radioelements as Indicators and other Selected Topics in Inorganic Chemistry</span> (1928).<br>
<br>Before he left the Radium Research Institute Paneth discovered the existence of a volatile polonium hydride, which led to the discovery of volatile bismuth and lead hydrides. After he left Vienna he discovered a volatile hydride of tin and much enlarged the knowledge of an already known germanium hydride. These studies led to the recognition that all elements with atomic numbers which have one to four units less than a rare gas are capable of forming gaseous hydrides. Through these investigations Paneth became the greatest authority of his time on volatile hydrides.<br>
<br>At Hamburg Paneth continued his important studies on surface adsorption and worked out a method which enabled him to determine the surface area of powders by using radioactive indicators.<br>
<br>Possibly Paneth's most important work, the demonstration of the existence of free radicals, was to a large extent carried out while he was at K&ouml;nigsberg. The preparation of free methyl had been attempted by Kolbe in 1849 and the concept of an organic radical had since been prominent in many theories of organic reactions, although direct proof was lacking. Paneth and his co-workers succeeded in showing that free methyl radicals produced in the gas phase could persist for a small but measurable time before recombining to form methane. Free ethyl was similarly produced from lead tetraethyl and shown to react with zinc, cadmium, antimony, and lead. He also succeeded in estimating the mean half-life of radicals.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1913 Paneth spent a few months with Frederick Soddy at Glasgow where he became interested in gas analytical methods which he later developed extensively and applied to the study of the isolation and measurement of minute amounts of helium and other atmospheric gases. He then applied these methods of helium analysis to the determination of the age of meteorites, and published <span class="italic">The Origin of Meteorites</span> (1940). He arrived at very high values for the age of some meteorites but the discovery of the production of helium by cosmic rays led him in 1952 to re-examine some of his conclusions. He arrived at the result that a substantial part of the helium present in iron meteorites was composed of <sup>3</sup>He and the age of the meteorites was correspondingly less. According to his paper published in 1954 the age of most meteorites is between 100 and 200 million years and some very much less. He investigated numerous meteorites and bequeathed to the Radium Research Institute in Vienna his collection of over a hundred specimens together with literature on the subject. His studies of meteorites led him on to the problem of the formation of the elements and the universe. He also made numerous contributions to the study of the stratosphere. Always a most fascinating lecturer, he was especially stimulating on these topics.<br>
<br>The methods of separating and measuring very small quantities of helium and other rare gases were used in other ways by Paneth. The first recorded measurement of a microscopic product in a nuclear reaction involving neutrons was made by him when he succeeded in measuring the helium formed in the neutron irradiation of methyl borate. Excited by this result, he presented it with characteristic flair. Describing the experiment to produce helium from methyl borate in such a way as to echo the alchemical pursuit of transmutation, he called it the &#145;Chemical detection of artificial transmutation of elements&#146;, and announced: &#145;for the first time, so far as we are aware&#151;an artificially produced element has been separated, spectroscopically observed, and measured. We presume that the old alchemistical goal can be achieved today in other cases too&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 136, July&#150;Dec 1935, 950).<br>
<br>An urbane man, Paneth&#151;in his various posts in Britain, Germany, and Canada&#151;was skilled in establishing an academic climate in which national differences among his staff were irrelevant, and in which values and opinions were freely exchanged. He encouraged chemistry students to take an interest in the history of science, a subject on which he lectured periodically from his earliest days as a university teacher, and on which he wrote many papers for journals such as <span class="italic">Nature</span>, <span class="italic">Discovery</span>, and <span class="italic">Endeavour</span>. These interests were reflected in his own way of life as a scientist. In a tribute to Frederick Soddy  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 180, July&#150;Dec 1957, 1086) he attributed Soddy's &#145;tragic isolation&#146; in part to his inability as a chemist to come to terms with the increasing influence of physicists on the study of radioactivity. Paneth, for his part, while expressing understanding of Soddy's predicament, promoted a historical understanding of the nature of chemistry as the antidote to such disciplinary resentments. Specifically, in an article entitled &#145;The role of chemistry in the study of atomic transmutation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 137, Jan&#150;June 1936, 560&#150;62), he urged that his parallel between the alchemical pursuit of transmutation and the modern field of radioactivity provided the kind of historical context that could assist chemists to carve out a specifically chemical role for themselves at the same time as working co-operatively with physicists.<br>
<br>Some of Paneth's general writings were published posthumously in 1964 under the title <span class="italic">Chemistry and beyond</span>, edited by H. Dingle and G. R. Martin. At Durham he energetically championed the reputation of the forgotten Durham cosmologist Thomas Wright (1711&#150;1786), whose work had influenced Immanuel Kant. Few knew that the round stone tower at Westerton near Durham had been Wright's observatory. Paneth succeeded in arousing public interest with the result that a memorial plaque was affixed to the tower and the two hundredth anniversary of the publication of Wright's <span class="italic">Original Theory</span> duly celebrated in 1950. Paneth was naturalized in 1939. He was a member of the Athenaeum and was elected FRS in 1947. He died at 78 Billrothstrasse, Vienna, on 17 September 1958 and was buried in the suburban churchyard of D&ouml;bling, where by his wish the inscription on his grave bears no more than his name followed by the letters FRS.<br>
