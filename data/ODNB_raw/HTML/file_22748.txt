<span class="headword">Price <span class="st"> [Prys]</span>,  Ellis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>y Doctor Coch]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1594), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of Robert ap Rhys (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1534) of Foelas and Plas Iolyn, Denbighshire, chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey and, as chancellor of St Asaph, the cardinal's principal agent in north Wales. The family had served the Tudors since 1485. As a member of St Nicholas's Hostel, Cambridge, Ellis Price (or Prys) distinguished himself in a disputation with two Oxford students. He graduated BCL in 1533 and DCL in 1535, and was known to his fellow Welshmen as <i>y Doctor Coch</i> (&#145;The Red Doctor&#146;), a sobriquet that has been variously explained as denoting either his red hair or his scarlet doctoral gown. He married Ellyw, daughter of Owen Pool, priest, of Llandecwyn, Merioneth; they had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Price was one of the monastic visitors in Wales in 1535. Despite the support of Rowland Lee, president of the council in the marches, he was suspended from his duties when his fellow commissioners complained of the scandal caused by his youthful indiscretions and &#145;progeny&#146;. He was rehabilitated in 1538, when at Thomas Cromwell's instigation he was appointed commissary-general and chancellor of the diocese of St Asaph. In the meantime he and his brother Richard, abbot of Aberconwy, sought to have the house exempted from the dissolution of the smaller monasteries. Along with his kinsman John Lloyd, Ellis was sued in the court of chancery in 1537 by the vicar of Llanarmon-yn-I&acirc;l, in the newly formed shire of Denbigh, for misappropriation of tithes. Ellis was later ejected from the rectory of Llangwm, but retained the sinecure rectories of Llandrillo-yn-Rhos and Llanuwchllyn.<br>
<br>Price was an assiduous iconoclast in implementing the new laws against the &#145;superstitious&#146; abuse of images and religious practices. In 1538 he drew Cromwell's attention to the continued veneration by pilgrims of the image of Derfel Gadarn in the diocese of St Asaph. He was careful to inform Cromwell that he had spurned a bribe offered by the incumbent and parishioners of Llandderfel to spare the image. Cromwell used it as kindling for the burning of the Observant friar John Forest, condemned for denying the royal supremacy. An active member of the convocation of 1547, Price was appointed by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer in 1549 to a commission to visit the diocese of St David. But after the Henrician <span class="roman">Acts of Union</span> of Wales with England he was mainly involved in civil administration. He was <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Merioneth in 1543, and from 1555 until his death, and served as sheriff of Merioneth, Anglesey, Caernarfon, and Denbigh during three reigns. He was elected knight of the shire for Merioneth in Mary's last parliament and in Elizabeth's second.<br>
<br>In 1560 Price became a member of the council in the marches of Wales. After 1564 he assumed the role of chief agent of the earl of Leicester in his lordship of Denbigh and the forest of Snowdon. As steward of Denbigh he was one of the four chief tenants who represented the Welshry of the lordship in negotiations with the earl for the commutation of their customary dues. He also served on the last of three commissions obtained by Leicester to search out concealed lands in the forest of Snowdon (1573). Some of the gentlemen of Ll&#375;n who resisted these inquiries were subsequently imprisoned. The commotion was commemorated in the <i>cywydd</i> by Edmund Prys (1544&#150;1623), archdeacon of Merioneth, &#145;yn erbyn anllywodraeth y Cedyrn&#146; (&#145;against the unruliness of the great&#146;). In 1560 Price had secured from the crown the manor of Tir Ifan, parcel of the lands of the knights hospitaller at Ysbyty Ifan, Dolgynwal, which became one of the family seats. His younger brother Cadwaladr established another branch of the family with an estate at Rhiwlas, Merioneth. By 1561 Ellis was chancellor of the diocese of Bangor, where he also held the parsonage of Llaniestyn. When in February 1566 the earl of Pembroke nominated Price to the vacant see of Bangor, Archbishop Parker appealed to William Cecil to prevent the appointment, he &#145;neither being priest nor having any priestly disposition&#146;. Parker would rather run the risk of offending Pembroke than commend a &#145;doubtful man&#146; to the queen for consecration. In a later letter to Cecil, Parker added another reason for taking pause before filling the vacancy. The &#145;wise men&#146; he had consulted, some of them from the country there, had advised against appointing a Welshman to Bangor, for the Welsh &#145;band so much together in kindred, that the bishop can do not as he would for his alliance sake&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 257&#150;61).<br>
<br>This objection was overcome with the appointment to the see of the Welshman Nicholas Robinson, with whom Price seems to have co-operated well enough on a commission of 1578 to investigate the recusants of the Ll&#375;n peninsula. He was particularly assiduous in searching Plas-du, Caernarvonshire, the home of Thomas Owen, who maintained regular correspondence with his Catholic exile brothers Hugh and Robert. Price was one of the assistant justices in the trial at Wrexham in October 1584 of the schoolmaster Richard Gwyn (alias Richard White) for denying the queen's supremacy. The anonymous Catholic author of <span class="italic">The Life and Martyrdome of Mr Richard White</span> doubted whether Ellis, &#145;who is known to be as prophane a life as any in the world&#146;, was a fit man to sit in judgment on &#145;the servant of God&#146;, alleging that he had had children with his own sister  (Thomas, 104, 108).<br>
<br>The bard Wiliam Ll&#375;n commended Price as a Hebrew and classical scholar, but he took no discernible role in promoting the contribution of the reformers to consolidating the status of Welsh as a language of learning and worship. During a dispute over property rights in Wrexham in the reign of Henry VIII, Price was arraigned in the court of Star Chamber on a charge of assaulting his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24546/', "William Salesbury")</script>, the humanist scholar and translator. He was present in the Commons when the bill for translating the prayer book and <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Welsh was introduced in late February and early March 1563, but was absent from parliament for its final reading. However, Price may well have been responsible for devising the act 8 Eliz. c. 20, passed in this parliament's session of 1566. It repealed the measure of 1534 which provided <i>inter alia</i> for the trial in Caernarvonshire and Anglesey of offences committed in Merioneth. Merioneth was in a particularly anomalous position among the Welsh shires: another provision of the act of 1534, authorizing the trial in the border shires of suspects arrested in the marcher lordships, had in the second <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1543 been extended to apply to Merioneth as well, so that crimes committed there were also triable in Shropshire as the nearest English shire. As a crown official Price had experienced the difficulties of administering the provision of 1534 in a case involving his own household. In July 1553, at the sessions held at Shrewsbury for trial of offences committed in Wales, five men were indicted for murdering Ellis's servant in Denbighshire. Three of the defendants were executed, one was found guilty of manslaughter, and one acquitted. Price continued to intervene in Merioneth electoral politics after he had ceased to represent the shire in the Commons. He supported the Owens of Llwyn in their feud with the Salesburys of Rug, but his influence declined after Leicester's death in 1588. In an exchequer case of 1590 he and his son and heir were accused of unlawful entry into lands in the county.<br>
<br>Ellis Price's name figures prominently in the royal commission set up by the council in the marches for organizing the eisteddfod at Caerwys in October 1567. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22766/', "Thomas Price (c.1564&#150;1634)")</script>, became a bard and buccaneer of renown, and his own patronage kept his reputation sweet among the bards. Wiliam Ll&#375;n, one of the most distinguished poets of the age, lauded him as a &#145;second Moses&#146; endowed with great attributes of character and wisdom in exercising divinely ordained authority. In the verse of Si&ocirc;n Tudur, chief apprentice bard at the Caerwys eisteddfod, he is depicted as a protector of the country who was dedicated to imposing the rule of law. In gauging his reputation, the conventional praise of the bards must be weighed in the balance against the colourful accounts of his oppressions and &#145;indirect dealings&#146; left by his opponents. He was remembered in the community long after his death as a ruthless exploiter of opportunities for his own advancement. Thomas Pennant in his <span class="italic">Tours in Wales</span> describes him as &#145;the greatest of our knaves in the period in which he lived; the most dreaded oppressor in his neighbourhood, and a true sycophant&#146;  (Pennant, 3.140). Price's devoted service to Leicester is well documented, though the surviving correspondence with his patron does not bear out Pennant's claim that his invariable form of address was &#145;O Lord, in thee do I put my trust&#146;.<br>
<br>Price died on 8 October 1594, but his will was not proved until 24 May 1596; in it he charged his heir and executor, Thomas Price, to protect the interests of his brothers and sisters, and to &#145;place my base sons in some service, and not to suffer them to go a begging&#146;. Pennant refers to a portrait of him dated 1605 preserved at Bodysgallen, Conwy, which was presumably a copy, but its present whereabouts have not been traced.<br>
