<span class="headword">Livingstone <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stickney]</span>, Dame  Adelaide Lord</span>  (<em>c.</em>1881&#150;1970), <span class="occ">peace campaigner</span>, was born in the United States, the daughter of Charles Daniel Stickney of Fall River, Massachusetts, and his wife, Mrs Sutherland Orr. Little is known of her early life but she was educated privately in America and Europe, variously in Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and France. On 14 May 1915, while an American citizen resident in London, she married William Henry Darley Livingstone (<i>b</i>. 1876), a landowner of Belclare, Westport, co. Mayo, Ireland, the son of Henry Darley Livingstone; she then acquired British nationality. At the time of their marriage her husband was a lieutenant in the motor machine-gun service.<br>
<br>During the First World War Adelaide Livingstone worked for the Friends' Emergency Committee, set up in 1914 to counteract the mass hysteria surrounding &#145;enemy aliens&#146; in England. She also worked for the International Women's Relief Committee from November 1914 to May 1915. While in Brussels she organized repatriation parties, escorting British citizens back to the UK. In May 1915 the British government appointed her a member of the committee on the treatment of British prisoners of war, of which she became honorary secretary later in 1915. She spent some time in Switzerland investigating the system of repatriating British prisoners of war from Germany. In 1917 and 1918 she was sent to Holland with the British delegation to investigate the treatment of prisoners. At the end of the war she was appointed the Army Council head of the War Office mission to trace British soldiers reported as &#145;missing&#146; in France and Flanders. In this capacity she travelled widely in Europe, managing a staff of officials from both Germany and England. Between 1920 and April 1922 she was assistant director of Graves Registration and Enquiries in central Europe, with headquarters in Berlin and with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. For her wartime services she was among the first women to be created DBE in 1918.<br>
<br>A prominent pacifist, Livingstone joined the staff of the League of Nations Union (LNU) in 1923 and became head of special activities from 1928 to 1933. In 1934 she was seconded by the LNU to the National Declaration on the League of Nations and Armaments, which organized the national peace ballot. Between November 1934 and June 1935 half a million volunteers were organized to deliver and collect ballot forms in which the public were asked to vote on issues such as international disarmament and collective security. Over 11 million people took part in this voluntary poll, whose results were published in <span class="italic">The Peace Ballot: an Official History</span> (1935), written by Livingstone and her colleagues on the National Declaration Committee. They revealed overwhelming support for multilateral disarmament (90 per cent) and British membership of the League of Nations (nearly 96 per cent), but the ballot was soon rendered redundant by the collapse of collective security.<br>
<br>From 1936 to 1940 Adelaide Livingstone was secretary of the International Peace Campaign and became a leader of the United Nations Association in 1945. She obtained a divorce from her husband in 1924; there were no children of the marriage. She died at her home, 80 Carlisle Mansions, Westminster, London, on 14 September 1970.<br>
