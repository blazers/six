<span class="headword">Kennaway,  James Peebles Ewing</span>  (1928&#150;1968), <span class="occ">novelist and scriptwriter</span>, was born on 5 June 1928 at Kenwood Park, Auchterarder, Perthshire, the younger of two children of Charles Gray Kennaway (1894&#150;1941) and Marjory, daughter of G. T. Ewing of Pitkellony, Muthill. Both parents were of Perthshire stock. His father was a wealthy lawyer who also acted as factor to several Perthshire sporting estates, while his mother had trained as a medical practitioner. Kennaway was educated at Cargilfield School in Edinburgh (1937&#150;42) and at Trinity College, Glenalmond, Perthshire (1942&#150;6), but the even tenor of his childhood was destroyed by his father's sudden death from tuberculosis of the kidney in January 1941.<br>
<br>The death had a profound effect on the young Kennaway: he claimed that it gave him an early sense of mortality and awakened a need to experience life to the full. As he wrote to his mother in a letter in 1956, having seen his father die young he did not want to suffer the same fate. &#145;Just now I want to blaze, in every direction, right or wrong, just so I shan't sink with too much left undone, too much never tried, too many sensations missed.&#146;<br>
<br>After leaving school in 1946 Kennaway was called up for national service and was commissioned in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, serving with the 1st Gordon Highlanders in Germany. In 1948 he entered Trinity College, Oxford, to read philosophy, politics, and economics and on graduating in 1951 became a publisher with Longmans, Green. On 6 October 1951 at St Mary Magdalen, Oxford, he married Mary St Joan Howard Edmonds (<i>b</i>. 1930), known as Susan, daughter of Bertram Eric Edmonds of Fairford, Gloucestershire, publisher. They set up home in north London and had four children: Emma (<i>b</i>. 1953), Jane (<i>b</i>. 1955), Guy (<i>b</i>. 1957), and David (<i>b</i>. 1959).<br>
<br>While working as a publisher Kennaway had started writing fiction and had achieved modest success with &#145;The Dollar Bottom&#146;, which was published in the January 1954 issue of <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>. Suitably encouraged, he completed his first novel, <span class="italic">Tunes of Glory</span> (1956), which centres on the rivalry between two men from different backgrounds for the command of a highland infantry battalion. It was well received by the critics: writing in the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> Peter Quennell forecast that Kennaway would &#145;take his place amongst the finest storytellers of the day&#146;. In 1957 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>The novel's success brought financial as well as critical rewards and in April 1957 Kennaway turned down the opportunity to become manager of the Longmans, Green office in Hong Kong. Instead he decided to concentrate on writing and in 1961 published his second novel, <span class="italic">Household Ghosts</span>. Set within the claustrophobic confines of an aristocratic Scottish family, it reveals the childhood fantasies and frustrated passions which lie behind an intense relationship between a brother and his sister, and her attempt to find with a lover the sexual satisfaction denied to her by her husband. During the same period Kennaway had begun a second career as a film scriptwriter and his first scripts included <span class="italic">Violent Playground</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">Tunes of Glory</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Although Kennaway still considered himself to be primarily a novelist, scriptwriting provided more substantial financial rewards. His script for <span class="italic">Tunes of Glory</span> proved that he could write commercially successful films, and in 1961 he was invited to work in Hollywood. The experience unnerved him in that it prevented him from concentrating on his novels. Also, away from his wife, he engaged in a number of casual affairs, claiming that an active sex life was the regenerative source of his literary ability. Later, in a diary entry, he characterized the split between the reliable family man and the philanderer as &#145;James et Jim, man and artist, wild boy and introvert&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1961 and 1962 the Kennaways travelled widely, living at different periods in California, Majorca, and Kashmir. On their return to London, Kennaway completed <span class="italic">The Bells of Shoreditch</span> (1963), a novel about marital infidelity and scandal in the financial world. The following year his marriage was again shaken when Susan Kennaway began a sexual relationship with David Cornwell (the novelist John le Carr&eacute;). The two men were friends and literary rivals. The discovery of the affair led to a period of intense anxiety on Kennaway's part. Throughout the experience, which came to an emotionally violent climax in January 1965 during a skiing holiday at Zell am See in Switzerland, Kennaway kept a detailed diary and notes. These were later edited and published by Susan Kennaway in <span class="italic">The Kennaway Papers</span> (1981). From them it is possible to see the extent to which Kennaway was prepared to dramatize his own life in order to provide material for his fiction. His third novel, <span class="italic">Some Gorgeous Accident</span> (1967), concerns a triangular relationship and many of its scenes are echoes of the relationship between himself, his wife, and le Carr&eacute;.<br>
<br>Following a period of separation, the marriage survived and in 1966 the Kennaways returned to live in Britain at the Manor House, Fairford, Gloucestershire. His other novels are <span class="italic">The Mindbenders</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The Cost of Living Like This</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Silence</span> (1972). He also continued to write for the cinema, including the script for <span class="italic">The Battle of Britain</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">Country Dance</span> (1970), based on his novel <span class="italic">Household Ghosts</span>.<br>
<br>Kennaway was killed in a motoring accident on 21 December 1968 while returning from London to Fairford. He was subsequently found to have suffered a heart attack at the time of the accident. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Fairford, Gloucestershire.<br>
