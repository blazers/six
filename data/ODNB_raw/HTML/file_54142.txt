<span class="headword">Boyd family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1480), <span class="occ">landowners and administrators</span>, rose to prominence from a landed base in Ayrshire. The first member of the family to achieve national eminence was <a name="cosubject_54142"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Boyd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1333)<span class="occ"></span> under Robert I, even though he played an uncertain role in the early stages of the wars of independence. Certainly following the general submission of 1304 he entered English service as coroner of Ayr and Lanark, and he was still associated with English agents in early 1305. But he was part of Robert Bruce's entourage later in that year and rebelled with Bruce in early 1306, taking Rothesay, besieging Inverkip, and attacking the earl of Strathearn. After the battle of Methven he escorted the Scottish queen to Kildrummy, although the account of his capture there is unlikely to be true, as he was not executed. According to chronicle sources, he was with Bruce, now Robert I, on Rathlin in the winter of 1306&#150;7, and accompanied Edward Bruce in an attack on Galloway in 1308. Thereafter he was prominent in all Robert I's campaigns, and attended that king's first parliament in 1309. It is very likely he fought at Bannockburn, following which he received the barony of Kilmarnock, forfeited by the former King John (John de Balliol), and the lands of Noddsdale in May 1315. Between 1309 and 1329 he witnessed a significant number of royal charters, although he was not constantly with the king. He is last recorded in the Scottish army at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333&#151;it is said that he was captured there and died soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Subsequent Boyds were less important for several generations. Sir Robert's great-grandson, Thomas Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1432), was briefly a hostage for James I's release from imprisonment in England in 1424. Thomas's son, Sir Thomas Boyd, was briefly imprisoned on 13 May 1424 as part of James I's attacks on the Albany Stewarts. In 1438 he killed Alan Stewart of Darnley, and was himself killed in revenge on 7 August 1439 by Alexander Stewart, in a feud over ambitions in the Lennox. He was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_3110"></a><span class="headword">Robert Boyd</span>, first Lord Boyd  (<em>d.</em> 1481/2)<span class="occ"></span>, who was involved in the murder of Sir James Stewart of Ardgowan on 31 May 1445. He was made a lord of parliament by James II in June 1452, along with a number of south-westerners, as a way of securing support in the wake of the king's murder of the eighth earl of Douglas. He witnessed the parliamentary forfeiture of the ninth earl of Douglas in June 1455, but was not particularly prominent in royal business at any time before 1466. Instead it is his brother, Sir Alexander Boyd of Drumcoll, who is most visible in the governmental records. A bond of 10 February 1466 makes it clear that at this time Alexander, the keeper of Edinburgh Castle and chamberlain, was virtually a partner with Gilbert, Lord Kennedy, in the governorship of the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14589/', "James III")</script>. Lord Boyd used his brother's links with Kennedy to enable the coup of 9 July 1466, when he led the seizure of James III following the exchequer audit at Linlithgow and took him to his brother's stronghold at Edinburgh. A parliament of October 1466 appointed him guardian, and witnessed the king's declaration, undoubtedly made under duress, that Lord Boyd had acted on his orders. Alexander Boyd was then discarded. He was excluded from the parliamentary apologia, and by early 1467 Lord Boyd had assumed his brother's offices.<br>
<br>Self-aggrandizement was used to reinforce a very narrowly based regime. Boyd's son <a href="#cosubject_3115">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a> was made earl of Arran, and early in 1467 was married to the king's sister Mary, while his daughter Elizabeth married the earl of Angus. In contrast, very little patronage was given to those who had taken part in the coup, or were sympathetic to it. To the antagonism of the nobility was added the irritation of the now nearly adult king, angered by Arran's marriage to his sister. On 25 April 1468, in order to prop up his authority, and to avoid calling a hostile parliament, Boyd had to make an agreement with prominent members of the council, by which they promised to defend Boyd's guardianship.<br>
<br>Boyd's period of office saw one notable success, with the ratification on 8 September 1468 of the treaty of Copenhagen by which Margaret of Denmark was betrothed to James III, the &#145;annual&#146;&#151;the payment due to Norway since 1266&#151;for the Western Isles was cancelled, and Orkney and Shetland were pawned to Scotland, in the first step to their subsequent annexation. But in the summer of 1469, while Lord Boyd was in England on embassy, and Arran still in Denmark, the king assumed control of government, presumably with the help of his councillors, and probably his half-uncles, the earl of Atholl and James Stewart of Auchterhouse. Lord Boyd, Arran, and Alexander Boyd were forfeited in parliament on 22 November 1469 for their treasonous seizure of the king three years before, although only the unfortunate Alexander was present to be executed. Lord Boyd had joined his son in exile in Bruges by early 1470. By 1471 he was in England, where Edward IV gave him a yearly pension of 200 marks, and was residing in Alnwick in 1475, to the annoyance of James III. He died in England in 1481 or 1482. He married Mariota, daughter of Sir John Maxwell of Calderwood, and had three sons.<br>
<br>The eldest of these, <a name="cosubject_3115"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Boyd</span>, first earl of Arran  (<em>d.</em> before 1474)<span class="occ"></span>, had been contracted on 20 January 1466 to marry Lord Kennedy's daughter, as part of Lord Boyd's wooing of the Kennedy regime. Instead, following the July 1466 coup, he was married to Princess Mary (<i>b</i>. 1451), elder sister of James III, and created earl of Arran by his father's influence, shortly before 26 April 1467. The marriage was undoubtedly unpopular, particularly with the king who later claimed to have wept at the wedding, as it was seen as a waste of a valuable dynastic commodity, not to mention an insult to the royal family. Arran's most important public role was as one of the ambassadors who concluded the treaty of Copenhagen in September 1468. When the Boyds fell in the summer of 1469 Arran was still abroad, and he was forfeited on 22 November. In October 1471 Arran, Lord Boyd, and Princess Mary attempted to return to Scotland. After stopping first in England, Mary went ahead, but was detained by the king. She was subsequently married to James, Lord Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1479), a rising star in James III's council, probably following Arran's death, which took place in England, before 1474. Nevertheless, Margaret maintained a residual loyalty for her first husband's family, and in the crisis of 1482 made an (eventually) abortive attempt to secure the succession of her son with Arran, James, to the Boyd lordship. Arran remained in England until his death.<br>
<br>The rise of the Boyds was short-lived, generally unpopular, and unsustainable in the face of parliamentary hostility and the coming of age of the king. However, they were part of a larger process in the 1460s, by which successive factions, largely based on south-western support, played out the rivalries of their region on a national stage.<br>
