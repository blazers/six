<span class="headword">Jenkins,  Vivian Gordon James</span>  (1911&#150;2004), <span class="occ">rugby player and journalist</span>, was born on 2 November 1911 at 24 Pentyla, Aberafan, Glamorgan, the son of Thomas Gordon Jenkins, schoolmaster, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James. At the age of nine he was sent to Llandovery College, from which he claimed to have returned during his first year suffering from malnutrition. His sporting talents developed as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the rugby master T. P. Williams, but he also represented the school at cricket and hockey and captained the cricket team for three years. He played senior rugby while still a schoolboy, making his d&eacute;but for Bridgend against Blaengarw in 1929. In 1930 he went to Jesus College, Oxford, as a classics exhibitioner, graduating with fourth-class honours in 1933. He won what he termed &#145;a decidedly lucky&#146; rugby blue during his first term when another player was injured  (Beken and Jones, vii), and as &#145;a centre of the solid, bullocking type&#146; played against Cambridge in all his three years as a student  (Arlott, Wooller, and Edelston, 123). Cricket honours in 1933 made him the first &#145;double blue&#146; from a Welsh school.<br>
<br>By the time he graduated from Oxford Jenkins was also an international rugby player. Hopeful of winning a Wales trial as a centre he received his selection to play full-back for Bridgend against Newport on Boxing day 1932 with &#145;not, I admit, the best of grace&#146;, since &#145;I thought my chance of a trial had gone&#146;  (Lawrie, 171). He played so well that he was chosen for the trial at full-back, and three weeks later made his d&eacute;but for Wales against England at Twickenham. Taken ill with flu, he was told by a team-mate, &#145;you may never get another chance to win a cap&#146;  (Hignell, <span class="italic">Turnbull</span>, 170); consequently he played with a 102 degree temperature and a sore throat in Wales's 7&#150;3 win, the first Welsh victory at Twickenham since the ground had opened in 1910. He was Wales's regular full-back until 1939. During this time Wales won eight and drew two of his fourteen international matches, losing five of the six he missed. He scored thirty-six points, including the first ever try by a Wales full-back, against Ireland in 1934 (a feat not repeated until 1967), two conversions in the 13&#150;12 defeat of New Zealand in 1935, and a penalty goal against Ireland to seal a Welsh championship in 1936. In 1938 he was vice-captain of the British Lions touring team to South Africa. He kicked three penalty goals (one from 8 yards inside his own half) in the first match against the Springboks, but was then forced to sit out the rest of the tour due to injury.<br>
<br>Jenkins was large and powerful at 6 feet tall and 13&frac12; stone in weight. He brought to the position of full-back the attacking instincts of the three-quarter he had been and a cricketer's certainty under the high ball, watching opponents' eyes in order to anticipate their next move. His frequent team-mate Wilfred Wooller recalled that he &#145;would tilt his head slightly on one side as he took the ball. It reminded one of an inquisitive bird wondering what was coming its way&#146;  (Arlott, Wooller, and Edelston, 124). He was an accomplished kicker, both at goal and from the hand. E. H. D. Sewell rated him the best kicker among inter-war full-backs: &#145;One seemed almost to feel the thump when &#147;VGJ&#148; let her have it; leaving us to gaze in admiration at the ball boring its way torpedo-like and getting valuable distance against the wind in a manner none watching had thought possible&#146;  (Sewell, 90).<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford Jenkins had secured a teaching post at Dover College. He played for London Welsh, captaining them in 1936&#150;7 and winning selection for Kent and London counties. He also played forty-four matches of county cricket as an amateur for Glamorgan from 1931 until 1937, occasionally deputizing as wicket-keeper. In all first-class cricket he scored 1328 runs at an average of a little under eighteen runs per innings.<br>
<br>In 1939 Jenkins joined the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, but on the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the Territorial Army, rising to captain in the anti-aircraft command. He continued to play rugby when the opportunity arose, but his last serious match was for the British army against France in Paris in February 1940. On 1 April that year he married Susan (Sue) Fraser, the 25-year-old daughter of Thomas Hallett Fraser of Maidenhead. They had one son, David. Demobilized in 1946 he rejoined the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> and covered the England cricket tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1946&#150;7 and the West Indies in 1947&#150;8. As in his time as a player, rugby eventually became more important in his career in journalism than cricket. He joined the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> as its rugby correspondent on the retirement of the veteran Dai Gent in the early 1950s, staying on to his own retirement in 1976. He was also editorial technical adviser to <span class="italic">Rugby World</span> magazine from its foundation in 1960 to 1985, and founding editor, taking charge of the first twelve editions, of <span class="italic">Rothmans Rugby Yearbook</span> (1972&#150;83).<br>
<br>A rumbustious personality with an acute sense of humour, he particularly enjoyed British Lions tours, on which he was accompanied by a &#145;substantial portmanteau which generally contained the answer to every emergency&#146;, once extracting a miner's helmet with a lamp on its front when light faded in the press box. He wrote books on the Lions tours of 1955 (South Africa) and 1959 (New Zealand). His contemporary J. B. G. Thomas described him as &#145;methodical and detailed in his approach and, of all my colleagues, the most insistent upon accuracy&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">Rugby</span>, 212). The much younger official historians of the Welsh Rugby Union reckoned him &#145;one of the most perceptive writers of the modern period&#146;  (Smith and Williams, 414), although he was also described as a &#145;muscular rather than elegant&#146; writer  (private information). He was an early campaigner for significant reforms later taken for granted, like the differential penalty, introduced in 1978, and neutral referees at international matches.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife, Susan, in 1984 Jenkins divided his time between his home in Harpenden and New Zealand, where he developed a close friendship with Elinor Stewart, the widow of Ron Stewart, a New Zealand rugby player. He died at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Luton, on 5 January 2004, of septicaemia and a urinary tract infection. He was survived by his son.<br>
