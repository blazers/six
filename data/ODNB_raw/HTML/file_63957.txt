<span class="headword">Bloom,  Ursula Harvey</span>  (1892&#150;1984), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 11 December 1892 in Springfield, Chelmsford, Essex, the only daughter of James Harvey Bloom, a Church of England clergyman, and Mary Gardner (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1915), both from Norfolk families. Her mother, whom Ursula called Polly, left her philandering husband just before the First World War, moving Ursula and her younger brother, Joscelyn, from the rectory at Whitchurch near Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, to less comfortable circumstances at St Albans, Hertfordshire. Ursula was self-educated and at seven privately published her first book, <span class="italic">Tiger</span>. She was taught the piano and violin, and first worked as a cinema pianist to help support her family.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1916 Bloom married Captain Arthur Brownlow Denham-Cookes (<i>b</i>. 1890/91) of the 24th London regiment, who died in 1918 of influenza; they had one son, Philip. Her first novel was <span class="italic">The Great Beginning</span> (1924), and in the following year she began her normal output of two books annually. On 28 November 1925 she married Commander Charles Gower Robinson RN. In the 1930s she became a crime reporter for the <span class="italic">Empire News</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, then a feature writer for the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> and beauty editor of <span class="italic">Woman's Own</span>. She also wrote &#145;agony aunt&#146; columns.<br>
<br>Bloom was disciplined in her writing, striving for 10,000 words a day, and in her life, neither smoking nor drinking, and in 1937 joining George Bernard Shaw to support Gymnosophist societies that promoted nudity. Bloom began to have migraines in the 1940s when living in Malta, where her husband was stationed, and spent considerable time in hospitals seeking a cure. This experience was recounted in <span class="italic">No Lady in Bed</span> (1944) and led to several hospital novels under the pseudonyms Sheila Burns and Rachel Harvey. She wrote four stage plays in the 1940s and several radio plays in the 1960s.<br>
<br>In all, Bloom published some 560 books (she was once in the <span class="italic">Guinness Book of Records</span> as the world's most prolific female writer). These were mostly atmospheric romances that were insignificant but inventive and well constructed with a fluent, readable style. She admitted to being not romantically inclined, and thought her romantic novels were silly and light. She wrote them variously under her real name and as Sheila Burns. Most novels had emotive titles, such as <span class="italic">Love is Everything</span> (1933), <span class="italic">The Tides of Spring Flow Fast</span> (1955), and <span class="italic">Perchance to Dream</span> (1971). As Mary Essex, Bloom wrote modern romances, and as Lozania Prole she produced historical novels beginning with <span class="italic">Our Dearest Emma</span> (1949), based on the life of Emma Hamilton. She also wrote two slightly inaccurate biographies of her parents, recounting her father's life in <span class="italic">Parson Extraordinary</span> (1963) and her mother's in <span class="italic">Price above Rubies</span> (1965). Her seven autobiographies and memoirs included <span class="italic">Mistress of None</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Rosemary for Stratford-on-Avon</span> (1966), <span class="italic">A Roof and Four Walls</span> (1967), and <span class="italic">Life is No Fairy Tale</span> (1976). Her non-fiction included biographies such as <span class="italic">Hitler's Eva</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">The Duke of Windsor</span> (1972), and books on various subjects like religion, careers, needlework (for which she was noted), cookery, and beauty.<br>
<br>Bloom's second husband died in 1979, the year in which she wrote her last novel: the optimistic <span class="italic">Sweet Spring of April</span>. She died on 29 October 1984 at the Winton Nursing Home, Nether Wallop, Hampshire.<br>
