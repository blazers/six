</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newman, Sir  George</span>  (1870&#150;1948), <span class="occ">medical officer of health</span>, was born on 23 October 1870 at 14 Broad Street, Leominster, Herefordshire, the fourth child and second son of Henry Stanley Newman, a Quaker and for many years editor of <span class="italic">The Friend</span>, and his wife, Mary Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pumphrey. He began his education at a local dame-school before becoming a boarder at Sidcot School in Gloucestershire in 1881, then at Bootham School in York, 1885&#150;8. At the age of twelve he resolved to become a missionary, though his father, himself the founding secretary of the Friends' Foreign Missionary Society, favoured a career in the Indian Civil Service. Some time in 1886, however, Newman read John Lowe's <span class="italic">Medical Missions</span> and decided that medicine was his calling. He sat and failed the matriculation examination of Edinburgh University in October 1887, but passed on his second attempt six months later, and began his studies at the university in May 1888.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsinmedicine"></a>Early years in medicine</h2>Newman's early years as a medical student were undistinguished. He devoted much of his energy to religious activities, reviewing books for <span class="italic">The Friend</span> and joining the University Christian movement. Here he fell under the spell of the liberal evangelical Henry Drummond, who subsequently became a close friend and a model for Newman's own increasingly rationalistic faith. During his second year in Edinburgh Newman began holding weekly services in a lodging house in the Cowgate, experiencing for the first time the circumstances of slum life. He was equally shocked by the moral laxity of his fellow medical students, among whom he preached temperance. In 1890 he became one of the secretaries of the Medical Students' Christian Association. By 1892 he was applying himself more conscientiously to his medical studies, winning distinctions in medicine, surgery, obstetrics, and public health in the spring of that year, and graduated MB.<br>
<br>Shortly thereafter Newman moved to London. He became assistant physician to the London Medical Mission in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields in December 1892, but found the institution deficient in Christian spirit and resigned four months later. He continued to be involved in running a girls' club in the neighbourhood, however, and late in 1893 he became the warden of Chalfont House, a Quaker settlement in Bloomsbury. By this time his evangelical energies were increasingly being channelled into public health work, which he had studied in Edinburgh under Sir Douglas Maclagan. While at the medical mission he had addressed public meetings on temperance, and in February 1893 he began lecturing on hygiene and ambulance work for Essex county council. He also spent two years working part time for the medical officer of health to the Strand board of works, Francis Allan, collecting evidence for Allan's inquiry into the living conditions of the local population. In autumn 1894 Newman began studying at King's College, London, for the Cambridge diploma in public health, which he obtained in October 1895. Also in 1895 he took the Edinburgh MD and gold medal with a historical dissertation on the decline of leprosy in England and India, which he studied in the library of the prominent Quaker surgeon Jonathan Hutchinson. The dissertation won the university's Alison prize for medical jurisprudence and public health, and was published by Hutchinson's New Sydenham Society.<br>
<br>In January 1896 Newman was appointed part-time demonstrator at King's College, London, at a salary of &pound;100 per annum, teaching practical classes under the professor of bacteriology, Edgar Crookshank. The post also provided him with the opportunity to conduct bacteriological research, which resulted in the publication of a book, <span class="italic">Bacteria</span>, in 1899 and, with Harold Swithinbank, <span class="italic">The Bacteriology of Milk</span> in 1903. In March 1896 Newman applied unsuccessfully for the post of medical officer of health to Clerkenwell. Later that year he was offered a position as a medical inspector to the Local Government Board to oversee the practice of vaccination, but Newman wished to pursue a wider perspective on public health and turned it down. In January 1897 he was appointed part-time medical officer to the Holborn board of guardians. In April that year he became engaged to Adelaide Constance, the daughter of Samuel Thorp of Alderley Edge. An accomplished artist, she was herself a member of the Society of Friends, and the couple met through their common involvement in the Frideswide Girls' Club. They married in August 1898 and moved into a home in Woburn Square, Bloomsbury, though Newman retained the wardenship of Chalfont House. Meanwhile he was becoming increasingly involved in the liberal wing of the Society of Friends, though he did not always find favour among more conservative Quakers; in February 1900 a group of Friends publicly criticized him as a vivisectionist. He began editing <span class="italic">The Friends' Quarterly Examiner</span> at the end of 1899, and continued to do so anonymously for the next forty years; he took particular pleasure in the lively leaders that he wrote from &#145;The House of the Four Winds&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Publichealthwork"></a>Public health work</h2>Newman's career in public health was by this time beginning to gain momentum. In October 1897 he was offered the post of government bacteriologist to the India Office to study and advise on the control of plague, but he was increasingly of the view that Britain's public health needs must come before those of the dominions, and he declined the appointment. On 1 April 1900 he was appointed part-time consulting medical officer for Bedfordshire at a salary of 50 guineas. Also in April 1900 he was made temporary medical officer of health to Clerkenwell, whereupon he resigned from the wardenship of Chalfont House and from his demonstratorship at King's College. In June 1900 he secured his first permanent full-time position as medical officer of health to the new metropolitan borough of Finsbury, a poor and overcrowded area of London with a growing immigrant population and very high death rates, especially among children.<br>
<br>Newman's first real test as a public health doctor came with an outbreak of smallpox in the summer of 1901. He initiated a policy of intensive surveillance, isolation, and investigation of contacts, to which he attributed the comparatively small number of deaths in the area under his jurisdiction. He was also concerned at the very high death rate from tuberculosis in the borough, to combat which he instituted strict inspections of food outlets including dairies, ice-cream parlours, and the meat trade, and established a scheme of voluntary notification and inspection of cases coupled with instruction in healthy living habits. These initiatives secured him a position on the council of the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, but had little impact on the incidence of the disease in Finsbury. Increasingly Newman was coming to the view that tuberculosis and other infectious diseases were as much an index of moral as of physical ill health, and must be countered by moral education as much as medical intervention. This view informed his campaigns against infant mortality in particular. In 1904, with charitable funds, he opened a milk depot under the control of the Finsbury Social Workers Association. Here nursing mothers received not only clean milk, but also education in infant management and the maintenance of a hygienic home environment. The milk depot was officially taken over by the borough council in 1906. In the same year Newman published <span class="italic">Infant Mortality: a Social Problem</span>, which described his work in Finsbury and the philosophy behind it. During this period he also served as a smallpox consultant, lecturer, and examiner to the Royal Sanitary Institute; as a member of the council of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; and from 1905 as lecturer in public health to St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school. He collaborated with Sir Arthur Whitelegge on a thoroughly revised edition of the latter's <span class="italic">Hygiene and the Public Health</span>, which appeared in 1905, and in 1907 his own book on <span class="italic">The Health of the State</span> was published.<h2>
<a name="Intocentralgovernment"></a>Into central government</h2>In 1906 Newman was contacted by Beatrice Webb, who had recently been appointed a member of the royal commission on the poor laws. Webb was keen to use the commission as a forum in which to argue for the creation of a universally available state medical service under the control of the public health authorities. Newman sympathized with her ideas and presented evidence to the commission that became a key source for many of the arguments she incorporated into her minority report of 1909. Most importantly, he put forward the view that under an appropriately organized system of state medicine the provision of personal health care by general practitioners might be oriented to the work of preventive as much as curative medicine. Through his association with Webb, Newman also met her friend and ally Sir Robert Morant, permanent secretary to the Board of Education. It came as a surprise to Newman when, presumably through Morant's advocacy, in August 1907 he was offered the new post of chief medical officer to the Board of Education, with responsibility for setting up a new school medical service. He took up the post in December, at a salary of &pound;1200. Newman's appointment met with outspoken hostility from many in the medical profession, who feared that the school medical service represented an encroachment of state medicine on private practice, and from the London county council, who initially refused to implement the scheme of medical inspection that Newman drew up. In recognition of his work for the service Newman received a knighthood in the new year's honours list for 1911.<br>
<br>In 1911 the government passed the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span>, which provided, among other things, for the establishment of a system of national health insurance to provide free medical care to a significant proportion of the working population. This scheme, which eventually came into being in 1913, fell far short of the vision of a state medical service that Webb had sketched for the royal commission on the poor laws. Nevertheless, the act of 1911 created opportunities for further expansion in specific aspects of public health medicine. Most notably, it made special provision for the treatment of tuberculosis cases, and in 1912 a departmental committee chaired by Lord Astor was appointed to recommend an appropriate scheme of services. Newman served on this committee, where he helped to ensure that tuberculosis treatment was brought under the aegis of the public health authorities and was expanded to cover not just the insured but the entire population. The committee also considered how best to make use of the penny per insured person that the <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> set aside for medical research, and in June 1913 its recommendations resulted in the establishment of the Medical Research Committee (later Council). Five months later Newman was offered the post of secretary to the new committee. He was tempted to accept, in the hope that the committee would provide a base from which to further his aim of creating a state medical service, but in the end he decided that he would be able to do more for public health if he remained with the Board of Education and the school medical service.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war led to serious delays in the development of the school medical service as government funds were reallocated, local education authorities cut back their inspection programmes, and doctors enlisted in the forces. Newman's energies, too, were diverted into war-related work. In May 1915 he was appointed medical officer to the central control board for liquor traffic, established under the defence of the realm regulations to minimize manpower wastage due to alcohol. In this capacity he was able to give practical expression to his temperance sentiments, particularly by promoting the establishment of factory canteens as an alternative to the attractions of the public house. Four months later he was also appointed chairman of the Health of Munition Workers Committee of the Ministry of Munitions, which oversaw research into a variety of problems including industrial fatigue, TNT poisoning, and other conditions. He also undertook war work in a voluntary capacity. In autumn 1914 he became involved in the establishment of the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which provided medical care for soldiers and civilians in the war zone, and following the introduction of conscription in 1916 he helped to negotiate exemptions for Quakers serving with the ambulance unit. With all this on his plate he felt unable to continue his lectureship at St Bartholomew's Hospital and resigned in January 1916. His contribution to the national effort was officially acknowledged when he was appointed KCB in 1918.<h2>
<a name="MinistryofHealth"></a>Ministry of Health</h2>By 1916 the government was beginning to give serious thought to the problems of post-war reconstruction. Among the schemes under consideration was the creation of a new Ministry of Health which would unify responsibility for the various medical services scattered around different departments of government. For the next three years Newman worked closely with Morant, who from 1911 had overall charge of the national insurance administration, and Christopher Addison, the minister for reconstruction, to draw up a scheme for combining the medical functions of national insurance and the Local Government Board in a single administrative department. Fulfilment of this scheme was delayed by political resistance from poor law and insurance interests, but on 1 April 1919 Newman was appointed chief medical officer to the Local Government Board, and two months later the new ministry was constituted with Newman as chief medical officer, Morant as permanent secretary, and Addison as minister. They envisaged a new kind of ministry in which the medical staff would be given parity of status and remuneration with the lay officials, in contrast to the distinctly subordinate position of technical experts in the old Local Government Board. They were only partially successful in securing this aim, however. Newman was given a salary of &pound;2100, subsequently raised to &pound;2300 in June 1921, but not the official rank of permanent secretary that he hoped for; although he was given the right of direct access to the minister this was an <i>ad hominem</i> concession and did not attach to the post of chief medical officer.<br>
<br>Newman's influence within the ministry was subsequently undermined when Morant died suddenly from influenza in March 1920, to be replaced by the far more conservative figure of Arthur Robinson, and again when Addison was forced to resign as minister in the following year. Though Newman remained in post until retirement in 1935, when he was appointed GBE, he was unable to effect any further major reforms in medical administration. Much of his energy was devoted to summarizing the state of the nation's health in a series of monumental annual reports to the ministers of health, and to reiterating his personal vision of preventive medicine in a wide range of official memoranda and public lectures, including the annual oration to the Hunterian Society in 1926; the Dodge lectures, &#145;Citizenship and the survival of civilization&#146;, at Yale University in 1926&#150;7 (published in 1928); the Charles Hastings lecture of the British Medical Association in 1928; the Linacre lecture at Oxford University in the same year; the Halley Stewart lectures, &#145;Health and social evolution&#146;, in 1930; the University of London's Heath Clark lectures, &#145;The rise of preventive medicine&#146;, in 1931; and the Harveian oration to the Royal College of Physicians in 1932. He also served as crown nominee on the General Medical Council, 1919&#150;39, and was latterly its senior treasurer. He enjoyed good relations with leading medical men&#151;the patrician culture in which they moved evidently appealed to him&#151;and he did much to persuade them that the concerns of private practice could be reconciled with the demands of state medicine. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1928, and subsequently of the New York Academy of Medicine; he received the Bisset-Hawkins gold medal from the Royal College of Physicians in 1935, and the Fothergill gold medal from the Medical Society of London in the same year.<h2>
<a name="LateryearswiththeBoardofEducation"></a>Later years with the Board of Education</h2>As well as serving as chief medical officer to the Ministry of Health Newman retained the post of chief medical officer to the Board of Education until his retirement, with the aim of ensuring co-ordination between the school medical service and other health services. He oversaw renewed expansion of the school medical service after provision of treatment by local education authorities was made compulsory under the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1918, but in the context of inter-war economic depression his privileging of health education over more material forms of provision provoked frustration among many public health doctors. He also used his position at the Board of Education to pursue reforms in medical education, which he saw as another means of reorienting doctors towards the practice of preventive as well as curative medicine. In particular he was firmly of the view that control of clinical training should be taken away from the &eacute;lite private practitioners who dominated the work of the teaching hospitals at the start of the twentieth century and handed over to university based academic teachers.<br>
<br>In 1908, when the Board of Education had begun to award grants to medical schools, Newman had acquired the leverage to start nudging clinical teaching into more academic channels. Then in 1913 the royal commission on the University of London urged that clinical teaching in several of the metropolitan medical schools should be brought entirely under university control. Working first through the Board of Education then subsequently, from 1919, as medical assessor to the new University Grants Committee, Newman was largely responsible for the negotiations which led to the establishment of full-time university chairs of medicine, surgery, and gynaecology in a number of schools. He also played a major part in drafting the 1921 report of the Athlone committee on postgraduate medical education, which paved the way for the establishment of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1924.<br>
<br>Thereafter, however, the initiative in the reform of medical education passed increasingly to the Medical Research Council, and Newman's distinctive view that medical training should serve the needs primarily of general practice and preventive medicine tended to be forgotten. The universities appreciated his efforts, however, and his honorary degrees included a DCL from the University of Durham (1919), a DSc from Oxford (1936), and the LLD from London, Edinburgh, McGill, Toronto, Glasgow, and Leeds.<br>
<br>Newman was rather short in stature, but made up for this by his vivacious and dramatic manner in conversation and his eloquence in lectures. As a politician and administrator, he inclined towards an evangelical faith in the power of the written word, as his enormous literary output attests; as a result he was most effective when working with others more pushy than himself, and by far his most fruitful period was marked by his partnership with Morant. He largely withdrew from public life after his retirement, though he found the time to publish <span class="italic">The Building of a Nation's Health</span> in 1939, and to speak at the centenary of the Quaker journal, <span class="italic">The Friend</span>, in 1943. His wife died in April 1946; they had no children. Newman himself died at The Retreat, York, on 26 May 1948, and was buried in the historic Quaker burial-ground at Jordans.<br>
