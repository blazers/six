<span class="headword">Stairs,  William Grant</span>  (1863&#150;1892), <span class="occ">army officer and traveller</span>, the third son of John Stairs (<i>d</i>. 1888) of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and his wife, Mary Morrow (<i>d</i>. 1871), was born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 1 July 1863. He was educated until the autumn of 1875 at Fort Massey Academy, Halifax, and afterwards at Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh, until July 1878 when he entered the Royal Military College at Kingston, Ontario, Canada. In September 1882 he went to New Zealand, where he was employed as a civil engineer in surveying and mapping the district near Hawke's Bay. On 30 June 1885 he was gazetted lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, and went through a course of professional instruction at Chatham. This was completed in 1886, and at the end of that year he was the first candidate selected by H. M. Stanley for service on the Emin Pasha relief expedition, during which he was to be placed in charge of the newly invented Maxim gun. He sailed with the expedition, on leave from the War Office, on 20 January 1887, and arrived at the Congo River on 18 March. The expedition reached Leopoldville, near Stanley Pool, on 21 April, and the advance in steamers up the river commenced on 3 May. At Bolobo on 12 May the expedition was formed into two columns. Stairs accompanied the advance column under Stanley, and commanded the second company of Zanzibaris. The ill-fated rear column was left behind at Yambuya, 1300 miles from the sea, under Major Walter Barttelot, James Jameson, John Troup, and Herbert Ward.<br>
<br>The march of the advance column eastward from Yambuya began on 28 June 1887. Stanley, writing of the qualities of the four members of his staff then with him (Stairs, Captain R. H. Nelson, Arthur Mounteney Jephson, and surgeon Thomas Heazle Parke) observed: &#145;Stairs is the military officer, alert, intelligent, who understands a hint, a curt intimation, grasps an idea firmly, and realises it to perfection&#146;. On 13 August at Avisibba, in one of many violent encounters with local forces, Stairs was wounded by a poisoned arrow, but, under the skilful care of Parke, recovered. Then followed an exhausting march of 156 days through dense tropical forest. The party dropped fifty men on 19 September at Ugarrowa's settlement, and on 6 October left Nelson and Parke and fifty-two men at Kilonga-Longa's. But Stairs, with Stanley and the rest of the party, emerged out of the forest into open country near Indesura on 4 December 1887. Another battle took place on 10 December, Stairs leading one of the columns; and desultory engagements continued until, on 13 December, Stanley and Stairs reached Lake Albert.<br>
<br>Apparently unable to learn anything of Emin Pasha or to obtain canoes on the lake, the expedition on 16 December retraced its steps to West Ibwiri, where Fort Bodo was constructed. On its completion, on 18 January 1888, Stairs was dispatched with 100 men to bring up Nelson and Parke. By 12 February Stairs had successfully accomplished his mission, which involved a journey of 79 miles each way. Four days later he was sent to escort couriers as far back as Ugarrowa's (183 miles) and see them safely across the river. Later in the year Stanley left Stairs in command at Fort Bodo while he went in search of the rear column, of which nothing had been heard for a long time.<br>
<br>Stanley returned without any information on 20 December 1888, and on the 27th Stairs was sent forward with 100 rifles to hold the ferry at Ituri River. On 9 January 1889 Fort Bodo was burned, and the whole force crossed the river and established a camp in the village of Kandekore, on the east side. Here Stairs was left in command, in company with Parke, while Stanley went to find Emin and Jephson. Stairs joined Stanley on 18 February at Kavalli's on Lake Albert, where Emin Pasha had already arrived. On 10 April a start for Zanzibar was made, the column being 1500 strong. On 6 June Stairs was sent with a party to explore Ruwenzori, popularly known as the &#145;mountains of the moon&#146;. Although he was able to ascend only some 10,000 feet, this venture was regarded as one of the few contributions to geographical knowledge accomplished by the expedition. Zanzibar was reached on 6 December 1889.<br>
<br>Stairs arrived in England in January 1890, and was appointed adjutant of the Royal Engineers at Aldershot. He received from the khedive of Egypt, under the authority of the sultan of Turkey, the third class of the order of the Mejidiye, and permission to accept and wear it was gazetted on 18 February 1890. On 25 March 1891, influenced by a desire to obtain greater freedom for travel, Stairs accepted promotion out of the Royal Engineers to be captain in the Welsh regiment (the 41st). In May, with permission from the War Office, he took command of an expedition of the Belgian Katanga Company to Msidi's country, in the extreme south-east of the territory assigned to the Congo Free State. The Belgian Katanga Company, in which there was a good deal of English capital, was formed to open up the country by trading in indiarubber and ivory.<br>
<br>Stairs left Belgium for Zanzibar in May 1891. Eventually, with German aid, he got together 500 men on the African coast, and on 4 July started for Lake Tanganyika along the beaten caravan track. With further help from the Germans, he reached the lake, and, crossing it, made an unprecedentedly rapid march to Ngwena on the River Luapula. He suffered from fever during the journey, but otherwise all went to plan. Katanga was reached, and the region found to be in turmoil following the death of Msidi.<br>
<br>Stairs then took the caravan to the River Shire, and by way of that river and the Zambezi on to the coast. While waiting at Chinde for a ship to Zanzibar, he fell ill of gastric fever and he died on 9 June 1892. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Stairs was described by one of his contemporaries as a &#145;tall, fair and delicate-looking young man; at first sight, very unlike the typical African traveller&#146;. Nevertheless, in contrast to many of his colleagues on the Emin Pasha relief expedition, his reputation appears to have been unscathed by the controversy over the fate of its rear column which developed during 1890.<br>
