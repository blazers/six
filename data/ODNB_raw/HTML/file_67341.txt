<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Linklater,  Eric Robert Russell</span>  (1899&#150;1974), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 8 March 1899 at Penarth, Glamorgan, the only son and elder child of Robert Baikie Linklater (1865&#150;1916), master mariner, of Dounby, Orkney, and his wife, (Mary) Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1867&#150;1957), daughter of James Young, master mariner. Though herself no Scot, Elizabeth Linklater was passionately Scottish and Orcadian in her loyalties. She insisted on maintaining a holiday house in Orkney, where the Linklaters had lived for many generations, and once it became possible she transferred the family home from Cardiff to Aberdeen. Eric Linklater, who would also see himself as both Scottish and Orcadian, attended Aberdeen grammar school from 1913 to 1916.<br>
<br>In 1914 Linklater enlisted in a territorial battalion of the Gordon Highlanders, but when war broke out he was rejected for service because of his poor eyesight. In 1917, however, by which time his father had died in Ceylon after an engagement with a German U-boat, he contrived to get himself accepted by the army and then posted to France. He served with the Black Watch in late 1917 and early 1918, until wounded in the course of the German spring offensive. Ironically, given the basis of his previous rejection, he became a sniper. In spite of grudgingly admitting to terror of the mud, the bullying, and the sudden slaughter of the western front, he was exalted. The war was for him a deep and intense emotional experience, as he recorded in <span class="italic">Fanfare for a Tin Hat</span> (1970):<blockquote>My few weeks as a sniper gave my life an excitement, an intensity which I have never known since. I have, on the whole, had a happy life, and I have known much pleasure. But in my nineteenth year I lived at a high pitch of purpose, a continuous physical and mental alertness, that has never again suffused my brain and body. (Linklater, <span class="italic">Fanfare</span>, 67)</blockquote>His head wound was near fatal; he was saved only by the legendary tin hat.From 1918 to 1925 Linklater was a student at Aberdeen University, first, unsuccessfully, in medicine, a course of study which he had begun in 1916 and which provided material for his first novel, <span class="italic">White Maa's Saga</span> (1929). This was only the first example of his use of his own life experience as material for fiction. He subsequently studied English, and graduated MA in 1925, with first-class honours, being awarded the Seafield medal, the Minto memorial prize, and the Senatus prize in English. The unforgotten intensity of the eighteen-year-old, however, would leave the mature writer liable to search for novelty, change, and action, and ensured that travel would be a central feature of Linklater's life and writing. He spent the years 1925 to 1927 in Bombay, as an assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Times of India</span>. There followed a year in Aberdeen (1927&#150;8) as assistant to the professor of English, and two years (1928&#150;30) in the USA as a Commonwealth fellow, based first at Cornell and then at Berkeley.<br>
<br>Linklater's literary career proper began in 1929, and his output was both varied and prolific. He published twenty-three novels, three volumes of short stories, two children's books, two books of verse, ten plays (including several &#145;conversations&#146; for radio during the Second World War), three fine autobiographies, and another twenty-three books of miscellaneous essays and histories. His greatest popularity was in the earlier part of his career. His reputation was effectively established by his third novel, <span class="italic">Juan in America</span> (1931), a richly comic, picaresque extravaganza rather in the manner of Byron's <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, but based on his observation of the United States, then in the grip of the extreme absurdities of prohibition and the resultant gangsterism.<br>
<br>But, characteristically, Linklater hated to repeat himself, and he deliberately dashed the expectations of the vast readership of <span class="italic">Juan in America</span> by following it with <span class="italic">The Men of Ness: the Saga of Thorlief Coalbiter's Sons</span> (1932), a spare, laconic viking adventure in which traditional heroism is defeated, and the survivor, Gauk, is a small, comic figure, in some ways a precursor of the eponymous hero of <span class="italic">Private Angelo</span> (1946). This is only the most obvious example of Linklater's preoccupation with Orkney life and Old Norse literature and culture. He wrote in a letter to a friend that he wanted &#145;to make Scotland &#147;Viking-conscious&#148;&#146;  (Parnell, 126), and he had a personal belief in an aesthetic evaluation of action behind the viking way of life. In <span class="italic">The Ultimate Viking</span> (1955), he wrote:<blockquote>They were unabashed by social obligation, undeterred by moral prohibition, and they could be quite contemptuous of economic advantage and the safety of their own skins. But they saw clearly a difference between right and wrong, and the difference was aesthetic. If what they did became a story that would please the ear, then it was right and beautiful. (E. Linklater, <span class="italic">The Ultimate Viking</span>, 8)</blockquote>Linklater's son Andro recognized fatalism as a major element in his father's life and work, and saw Linklater as &#145;a convinced, unwavering pagan&#146;, perceiving a major preoccupation in his father's stories as &#145;the proper way to confront an inevitable fate&#146;  (A. Linklater, &#145;Introduction&#146;, to E. Linklater, <span class="italic">The Goose Girl</span>, vii, x). Julian D'Arcy, who devoted a book to the influence of Old Norse literature on Scottish writers, detailed Linklater's studies in the sagas, and, although he found Linklater's interpretation of viking saga and ethos a trifle slanted, concluded that he &#145;was so steeped in Old Norse lore and literature in both his personal and literary life, that it would be perhaps appropriate to give him the epitaph of the &#147;Ultimate Viking&#148; of modern Scottish literature&#146;  (D'Arcy, 238).<br>
<br>In 1933 Linklater experimented with the world of the &#145;Scottish Renaissance&#146; in literature and politics, and stood as the Scottish nationalist candidate in a parliamentary by-election in East Fife. This resulted in <span class="italic">Magnus Merriman</span> (1934), a light-hearted and thinly fictionalized account of his disastrous campaign, including much fairly affectionate satire on contemporary Scotland, and a parodic representation of C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) in the poet&#150;leader Hugh Skene. On 1 June 1933 he had married <a href="#cosubject_67341">Marjorie MacIntyre [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and after a period in Italy the couple settled at Dounby in Orkney; they had two daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Linklater's experiences in the First World War had made him particularly sensitive to the paradox of the horrors of war on the one hand, and its broadening of experience on the other. He repeatedly illustrated this paradox in his writing, and also continually expressed his unfailing admiration and love for the soldiers who carried on the war. He wrote a great deal about combat, in military histories and pamphlets as well as fiction. Between the wars he saw communism as just as dangerous as fascism, and was emotionally disabled by the Spanish Civil War, finding it impossible to support either side wholeheartedly. His fictional response took the form of <span class="italic">The Impregnable Women</span> (1938), a loose adaptation of the <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span> of Aristophanes, inspired by angry revulsion against the prospect of the war's renewal. <span class="italic">Judas</span> (1939), however, with its themes of loyalty and treachery, was inspired by the way in which Britain and France in particular had deserted the cause of Czechoslovakia in the name of appeasement.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1941 Linklater commanded the Orkney fortress company, Royal Engineers. He was then posted to the directorate of public relations in the War Office, where he wrote pamphlets on several aspects of the army at war; he also produced at this time, in his personal capacity, a number of conversation pieces on war aims. From 1944 to 1945 Linklater served in Italy, and it was there that he had the experiences central to his most successful war novel, <span class="italic">Private Angelo</span> (1946), a work dedicated to the Eighth Army. Linklater described his love affair with Italy as &#145;a state of idealistic adultery&#146;. &#145;[T]he subject of my novel was not only war and its capacity for destruction, but Italy and its genius for survival&#146;  (Linklater, <span class="italic">Fanfare</span>, 316). The work's protagonist, Angelo, has led a rout of Italians fleeing from battle, and is dismissed in the first sentence as lacking the gift of courage. But the novel goes on to re-examine the idea of courage, and to stress the importance of understanding. By the end Angelo has served in three armies (Italian, German, and British) and has become the father of children, three of them illegitimate, one English, one Polish, and one Moroccan. The tenor of the book is against nationalism, and Linklater prefigures Heller and Waugh, and even Henry Kissinger, when he has the innocent Angelo say: &#145;I hope you will not liberate us out of existence&#146;. As armies bomb their own troops, and Angelo repeatedly deserts, the reader is shown the essential folly of war. But the wandering refugees, and the rapes of both Angelo and his fianc&eacute;e, keep the serious horror in the forefront, and serve to maintain Linklater's conviction that, despite everything, this is a just and necessary war.<br>
<br>In 1945 Linklater was elected rector of Aberdeen University, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1946. In 1947 the Linklaters left Orkney, where conditions had changed greatly during the war, for Pitcalzean House in Ross-shire. Here they lived until 1972 when, faced with oil-related developments in the locality, they moved to Aberdeenshire. In 1951 he published a semi-official history, <span class="italic">The Campaign in Italy</span>, and visited Korea with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1954 he was appointed CBE; from 1968 to 1973 he was deputy lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty; and in 1971 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Linklater's novels in this later period are well written and ingenious, but to an extent lack the comic energy of their predecessors; and finding himself less in rapport with the public, he turned more to history as time went on. At the end of the twentieth century, however, they had yet to receive serious critical evaluation, which some certainly deserve. Linklater's best fiction often uses myth as a central structuring device, as with his use of Byron in <span class="italic">Juan in America</span>. <span class="italic">A Man over Forty</span> (1963) repeats that appropriateness by juxtaposing the worlds of twentieth-century television and ancient Greek myth: Edward Balintore is a television personality who unconcernedly submits to a gruelling interview on air, only to collapse suddenly and dramatically after confessing he is afraid of being found out. The book charts his comic journey in search of peace, his gradual self-discovery, and the exorcizing of his guilt. The basic myth is that of Orestes, and Balintore's buried memory of matricide and his pursuit by twentieth-century Furies forms the sober centre of a comic novel which combines all of Linklater's best ingredients.<br>
<br>Linklater was notable for his craftsmanship, his sense of style, his love of wit, and his zest for life, all of which are apparent in his autobiographies. As a novelist he excels mainly in providing civilized entertainment for intelligent middlebrow readers. Although he travelled widely his roots were deep in Scottish rural life: he loved fishing, walking, and boating, and once described himself as &#145;an old peasant with a pen&#146;  (Linklater, <span class="italic">Fanfare</span>, 326), although his lifestyle was in fact more that of a country gentleman. His manner tended to the brusque and military. In appearance, his most striking features were a high domed forehead, prematurely bald head with a deeply indented skull due to his war wound, rimless spectacles, and a moustache. He died in St John's Nursing Home, Aberdeen, on 7 November 1974 after a thrombosis, and was buried in the Harray churchyard in Orkney on 11 November.<br>
<br>Linklater's wife, <a name="cosubject_67341"></a><span class="headword">Marjorie Linklater</span>  (1909&#150;1997), <span class="occ">campaigner for the arts and the environment</span>, was born on 19 March 1909 at 19 Northumberland Street, Edinburgh, the daughter of Ian MacIntyre (1869&#150;1946), writer to the signet, Scottish rugby international, and later Unionist MP for West Edinburgh, and his first wife, Ida (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Charles Van der Gucht. Educated at St George's School, Edinburgh, Downe House, Berkshire, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, and considered a great beauty, she acted in small West End parts, then returned to Scotland. She met her future husband while campaigning for a Scottish national theatre. One of their sons described their marriage as &#145;turbulent and ultimately consoling&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 5 July 1997). Following the family's move to Ross-shire in 1947 she was a member of Ross and Cromarty county council (1953&#150;69), involved in conservation and education issues. She was also a member of the Scottish Arts Council (1957&#150;63). After her husband's death she moved back to Orkney, to which she was devoted. She was active in local heritage, arts, environment, and politics, successfully opposed uranium mining and off-shore nuclear-waste dumping, was chairman of the Orkney Heritage Society (1977&#150;81), helped establish the St Magnus festival, and campaigned for the Scottish National Party. She died on 29 June 1997 at 20 Main Street, Kirkwall, Orkney, and was survived by her four children, one of whom, Magnus (<i>b</i>. 1942), was editor of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (1988&#150;94) and chairman of the Scottish Arts Council (1996&#150;2001). Another, Andro Linklater (1944&#150;2013), was a prolific journalist and biographer, who began his writing career by completing the history of the Black Watch left unfinished on his father's death.<br>
