<span class="headword">Amherst,  William Amhurst  Tyssen-</span>, first Baron Amherst of Hackney  (1835&#150;1909), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was born at Narford Hall, Swaffham, Norfolk, on 25 April 1835, the eldest son of William George Daniel-Tyssen (1801&#150;1855), who had added Tyssen to his surname in 1814 on his marriage to Amelia, daughter of Captain John Amhurst RN, a native of Kent, and Mary, eldest daughter of Andrew Fountaine, of Narford. His maternal grandmother, Mary Tyssen, was daughter and heir of Francis John Tyssen, from whom the family inherited extensive property in Hackney. Together with his father he took by royal licence, on 6 August 1852, the name of Tyssen-Amhurst, for which he substituted Tyssen-Amherst on 16 August 1877.<br>
<br>A relationship with the Amhersts of Kent, descendants of the general, was remote. More direct was one with Sir Andrew Fountaine, the eighteenth-century virtuoso, among whose collections of books, coins, and works of art Tyssen-Amhurst grew up at Narford. He was educated at Eton College and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 19 May 1853. He was still an undergraduate when his father died in 1855, bequeathing him large properties in London and Norfolk. His country estates at Didlington Hall, near Brandon, and elsewhere totalled 9488 acres in the returns for 1881; he farmed on a large scale and was a noted breeder of Norfolk polled cattle. He was Conservative MP for West Norfolk (1880&#150;85) and for South-West Norfolk (1885&#150;92); he also served as high sheriff of his county in 1866. Tyssen-Amhurst married, on 4 June 1856, at Hunmanby, Yorkshire, Margaret Susan (1835&#150;1919), only child of Robert Mitford, of Mitford Castle, Northumberland, and of Hunmanby Hall. They had seven daughters, of whom six survived him. These included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73167/', "Alicia Margaret Amherst (1865&#150;1941)")</script>.<br>
<br>Collecting books and antiquities was Tyssen-Amhurst's chief interest, and he gathered a library rich in ecclesiastical history, especially of the Reformation and the Church of England, and in editions of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> (of which his collection was inferior only to that of Lord Ashburnham). Equally strong was his interest in the history of the spread of printing, and historic bookbindings. He bought steadily from the 1860s, often in friendly rivalry with the earl of Carysfort, and had the benefit in the saleroom of the regular agency of Bernard Quaritch. His library included seventeen Caxtons, in its day one of the two or three best collections in private hands, and his early printed books illustrated the spread of typography in practically every European country. He was a member of the Roxburghe Club and presented to his fellow members an edition (by I. H. Jeayes) of <span class="italic">Norfolk Letters of Philip Gawdy, 1579&#150;1616</span> (1906); he also presented volumes to the Hakluyt Society and the Scottish Text Society.<br>
<br>A detailed catalogue of Tyssen-Amherst's collection was in preparation by the distinguished bibliographer Seymour De Ricci, who gratefully recorded that he owed to Tyssen-Amherst's &#145;kind lessons in English bibliography &hellip; my own earliest interest in that difficult science&#146;. However, owing to the dishonesty of Charles Cheston, the solicitor entrusted with the administration of Tyssen-Amherst's estate and trust funds, a sale of the library at Didlington proved urgently necessary. De Ricci's <i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> had to be reduced to a much abbreviated (though still substantial) hand-list, speedily produced for private circulation in 1906. A major sale by Sothebys was organized: its two sections commenced on 3 December 1908 and 24 March 1909, and the total realized was &pound;32,592. The seventeen Caxtons were sold privately to John Pierpont Morgan for &pound;24,000. (Later sales were held by Sothebys on 12 December 1911, and on 17 January and 14 November 1921.)<br>
<br>Tyssen-Amherst also took a pioneering interest in Egyptian antiquities by collecting some important papyri, of which two catalogues were issued: by P. E. Newberry on the Egyptian papyri in 1899, and by B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt on the Greek in 1900. Both sections were eventually bought by Pierpont Morgan in 1913. Tyssen-Amherst's other antiquities included old Gobelins and other tapestries, French and English furniture, Limoges enamels, and English maiolica; these were sold by Christies on 11 December 1908 for &pound;38,796, with a further &pound;3500 being raised from prints and paintings.<br>
<br>Tyssen-Amherst, who had made little mark in the House of Commons, but who was rich and well connected, was created Baron Amherst of Hackney in Lord Salisbury's dissolution honours in 1892, with a special remainder to his eldest daughter, Mary Rothes Margaret, wife of Lord William Cecil, a son of the third marquess of Exeter, and their children. Lord Amherst was &#145;of middle height and sturdy appearance, of genial and unassuming manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He died suddenly on 16 January 1909 at 23 Queen's Gate Gardens, London, and was buried on 20 January in the family vault at Didlington.<br>
