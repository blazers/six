<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heywood,  Peter</span>  (1772&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at the Nunnery, near Douglas, Isle of Man, on 6 June 1772, the youngest of the seven children of Peter John Heywood (1739&#150;1790), deemster of the Isle of Man and son of a former chief justice there, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Spedding of Whitehaven, Cumberland. His uncle was Captain Thomas Pasley RN, and probably for this reason Heywood entered the navy, on 11 October 1786, after schooling in Cheshire and Westmorland. Friendship between the Heywoods and Richard Betham, William Bligh's father-in-law, persuaded Bligh to take Heywood as a volunteer aboard the <i>Bounty</i> on 27 August 1787 and on 28 October to promote him to midshipman.<br>
<br>When the mutiny broke out on 28 April 1789, Heywood's attitude was ambiguous. At his court martial he claimed to have been asleep, without knowledge of the mutiny until that moment, and then kept below by force until the launch was ready to receive Bligh and his party. But later statements, by John Adams in 1825 and in the journal of James Morrison, boatswain's mate, indicate that Heywood knew of Christian's plans to desert or take the ship by force. Heywood was unable, convincingly, to refute statements that he had laughed at Bligh while held captive, had held a cutlass and helped hoist out the launch. In the confusion of the moment he may well, as a boy of sixteen, have done so. He admitted at his trial that he was afraid of going to almost certain death in the launch with Bligh and since it could not hold all those who wished to go, remained in the <i>Bounty</i> [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96371', "Bounty mutineers")</script>].<br>
<br>The mutineers landed at Tahiti and then split into two parties, some, including Heywood, remaining on land, and the others taking to sea again in the <i>Bounty</i>. When, on 23 March 1791, the <i>Pandora</i>, under Captain Edward Edwards, arrived in search of the mutineers, Heywood at once surrendered. The remainder were arrested by the next day and all fourteen were immediately put in irons, and into a specially built roundhouse, nicknamed &#145;Pandora's box&#146;, 11 by 18 feet, built on the after part of the quarter-deck, ventilated through two small iron gratings. Here they were kept under a 24-hour guard, though on full rations. Captain Edwards was afraid the prisoners would infect his own crew with mutiny and his harsh treatment was meant to prevent this. Nothing was discovered of the mutineers who had quitted Tahiti in the <i>Bounty</i>, despite a prolonged, though increasingly perfunctory, search. On 28 August the <i>Pandora</i>, while negotiating the Endeavour Strait, struck on the reef since known by her name. Three prisoners were released to man the pumps and all the remaining prisoners, bar one, were released in the last minutes, but four were drowned as the ship sank rapidly. For nineteen days the survivors remained on a small nearby key, preparing to sail on to the nearest European settlement, the Dutch colony of Timor. All were in great distress but the prisoners were left naked, without shelter or sufficient food. Both at Batavia, and on the passage to the Cape of Good Hope in a Dutch merchant ship, this severe treatment continued. Yet at Batavia, Heywood was permitted to send his family the first news of his survival they had received.<br>
<br>At the Cape, Heywood was transferred to the <i>Gorgon</i>, where he was allowed daily exercise on deck, and was less rigorously confined. On arrival at Spithead on 19 June 1792 Heywood was sent on board the <i>Hector</i> (74 guns) whose captain, afterwards Sir George Montagu, a close friend of Captain Pasley, treated him with humanity. Pasley arranged legal advice for his nephew and a counsel, Aaron Graham, former deputy judge-advocate at courts martial on the Newfoundland station. But in letters to Heywood's sister, he regretted that Heywood had made no public protestation of loyalty during the mutiny and at best had appeared neutral, which alone was sufficient to condemn him. Heywood's request for a separate trial was rejected and on 12 September he, with the other prisoners, was court-martialled on the <i>Duke</i>. Heywood was fortunate in his connections for, among the members of the court, were Captain George Montagu and Captain Albermarle Bertie, a relation by marriage, both of whom had already shown him much kindness, while his family used all the interest at their command to support and protect him. The trial lasted for six days, and on 18 September they were all sentenced to death; but Heywood was strongly recommended to mercy and received a royal pardon on 27 October.<br>
<br>Lord Hood, who had been president of the court, advised Heywood to continue in the service, and offered to take him with him in the <i>Victory</i>. But on 17 May 1793 he joined his uncle Pasley's ship, the <i>Bellerophon</i>, later moving to the frigate <i>Niger</i> with Captain Legge. On 23 September 1793 he was moved into the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, bearing the flag of Lord Howe, with Sir Roger Curtis, captain of the fleet, Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas, and Captain Sir Hugh C. Christian, all of whom had been members of the court martial, and who remained his friends and patrons. In the actions of 28 and 29 May and 1 June 1794 Heywood acted as captain's aide-de-camp, and on the return of the fleet to Spithead was one of the two midshipmen appointed to attend the side when the king came on board the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>.<br>
<br>Once doubts as to Heywood's fitness to hold naval rank after his court martial were resolved, Lord Howe gave him an acting commission as lieutenant in the <i>Robust</i> in August 1794, which was confirmed on 9 March 1795, when he was appointed to the fire-ship <i>Incendiary</i>. On 23 June he was lieutenant of the <i>Nymphe</i> in the action off Lorient. He joined the East India station in the <i>Fox</i>, early in 1796, remaining in her until 18 June 1798 when he was moved with his captain and cousin, Pulteney Malcolm, into the <i>Suffolk</i> bearing the flag of Vice-Admiral Rainier. Heywood had been recommended to Rainier by Earl Spencer, then first lord of the Admiralty, who believed Heywood's conviction should not debar him from further promotion, especially in consideration of his subsequent good behaviour. In August 1800 Heywood was accordingly promoted commander of the bomb-vessel <i>Vulcan</i> and thereafter by acting orders from Rainier commanded various post ships until 5 April 1803, when he was confirmed in post rank. In January 1805 as a result of ill health and the death of his eldest brother, Admiral Rainier gave him leave to return home, warmly commending his services and character.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1806 Heywood was appointed flag captain to Rear-Admiral George Murray in the <i>Polyphemus</i> first at the Cape of Good Hope and later in the River Plate. In May 1808 he commanded the <i>Donegal</i> off Brest and in the Bay of Biscay. While in company with the <i>Caesar</i> and <i>Defiance</i>, on 25 February 1809 he attacked and destroyed three French frigates, part of a squadron which had escaped earlier from Brest and taken shelter in Sables d'Olonne. For this he received the Admiralty's thanks, on 18 March, and in the following May took command of the <i>Nereus</i>, a newly built frigate, in which he went out to the Mediterranean, and in April 1810 brought Lord Collingwood's body back to England. In retirement Heywood considered Collingwood had been a brave, able, refined, and cultivated man, equal in merit to Nelson, whom he thought a &#145;rough kind of fire-eater&#146;.<br>
<br>Heywood remained in the <i>Nereus</i>, employed on the east coast of South America, receiving the thanks of British merchants at Buenos Aires twice in 1811 and again in 1813, for his protection of their interests. He returned to England, in October 1813, in the <i>Montagu</i> to take command in the North Sea until April 1814. Having accompanied Louis XVIII to France and evacuated part of the British army from Bordeaux, at the subsequent naval review the <i>Montagu</i>, wearing the flag of Sir Thomas Byam Martin, led the fleet in manoeuvres before the allied sovereigns.<br>
<br>On Napoleon's escape from Elba, Heywood, still in the <i>Montagu</i>, joined Lord Exmouth in the Mediterranean on 20 May 1815, and transported British and imperial troops from Naples to Genoa and Marseilles. Heywood then served as senior officer at Gibraltar until February 1816 when he rejoined Exmouth in his first mission to the Barbary States. The <i>Montagu</i> was paid off at Chatham on 16 July, and Heywood did not serve again, though in 1818 he was offered the command of the Canadian lakes and later the post of Admiralty hydrographer, for which he successfully recommended Rear-Admiral Francis Beaufort. This offer indicates the respect in which his abilities as a hydrographer were held. While in the East Indies he had surveyed much of the east coast of Ceylon and the adjoining mainland. Admiralty charts published later were based on this work Heywood presented to the Admiralty in 1805. In South America he carried out a number of surveys, the best known being of the River Plate. His work here and in the East Indies was used by James Horsburgh, hydrographer to the East India Company. After his court martial Heywood had prepared a Tahitian vocabulary, based on over two years' contact with the language. This useful work was presented to the first British missionaries sent there in 1796. Though it survives only in fragments, chiefly in the correspondence of the London Missionary Society, it is historically important for the period when the European impact on Tahitian culture was first felt.<br>
<br>On 31 July 1816 Heywood married Frances Joliffe (1782&#150;1863), the daughter of Colonel Graham of Stirlingshire and widow of an East India Company servant. Mrs Joliffe may have heard of Heywood from her uncle Aaron Graham, but she first met him in the scientific and literary circle she entertained at Dulwich, where she lived with her only child, Diana, and which included Sir Joseph Banks and other fellows of the Royal Society. After their marriage the Heywoods lived first at Clapham, then at Highgate, where their house was a centre for political, religious, and literary discussions. Among their friends were Sir Thomas Phillips, collector of manuscripts, and San Mart&iacute;n, the South American patriot, and they were early patrons of the painter Clarkson Stanfield. Heywood was attached to his stepdaughter and in 1830 promoted her marriage to Captain Edward Belcher RN.<br>
<br>Heywood was at his best in conversation with small groups of friends, when &#145;his serious sort of countenance &hellip; brightened in argument&#146;  (<span class="italic">United Service Journal</span>, 1831, 481). A contemporary description of him as &#145;rather above middle size, of a spare habit&#146;  (ibid.) but with good features, is confirmed by his portrait. In politics he was a whig who favoured Roman Catholic emancipation. He became ill in 1827, possibly with a heart complaint, since he reputedly found Highgate Hill too taxing. For this reason, in 1829, the family moved to the recently built Cumberland Terrace, where Heywood caught a chill in 1831. He died there, at number 26, after a short illness, on 10 February and was buried on 18 February in the crypt of the chapel of St Michael, Highgate School. A plaque to Heywood was unveiled at the chapel in 2008.<br>
<br>Heywood once declared he would be glad to live his life over again, exactly as it had been. For most men, the mutiny on the <i>Bounty</i> and its aftermath would have proved an irreparable block to future advancement, but strong naval interest and connections, in the customary eighteenth-century manner, ensured Heywood not only a pardon but an honourable and modestly distinguished career, with few of the gaps in employment and thus promotion most naval officers experienced. Heywood did not forgive Bligh for jeopardizing his life, and his lengthy contribution to Marshall's <span class="italic">Royal Naval Biography</span> in 1825 is, in part, an attack on Bligh's fitness to command, in justification of Heywood's part in the mutiny. This provided the basis for the subsequent, traditional picture of Bligh as an incompetent tyrant, reinforced by, among others, Lady Belcher in her book of 1870 on the mutineers. Yet Heywood's advancement was also the result of his professional abilities, and he formed one of a group of more scientific naval officers devoted to improvements in charting and surveying an expanding empire and to wider intellectual and liberal concerns.<br>
