<span class="headword">Lyon,  John</span>  (1710&#150;1790), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman and antiquary</span>, was the son of John Lyon, a blacksmith or ironmonger, and his wife, Sarah; who lived at the poorer end of Stephen Street in Dublin; he was probably born and was baptized on 5 October 1710 at St Bride's. Admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1724, as a pensioner, he was elected scholar in 1727, received his BA in 1729, his MA in 1732, and his DD eventually in 1751. His modesty and discretion gained him the patronage of Swift, who prized such qualities in young clergymen, as early as 1736. With Swift's help Lyon became a curate at St Bride's (October 1737) and a minor canon at St Patrick's Cathedral (July 1740). By this time, at Swift's request, Lyon had moved into the deanery to keep Swift's accounts, serve as his almoner and amanuensis, and generally &#145;to have an Eye upon him and his Affairs on Account of his departing Memory&#146;  (Lyon, &#145;Materials&#146;, facing p. 124). From Swift or his executors he received a large portion of Swift's private papers. In 1743 he also inherited the papers of Rebecca Dingley, the companion of Esther Johnson and co-recipient of the letters from Swift published as the <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>. Eventually Lyon disposed of most of his Swift letters, including those from the <span class="italic">Journal</span>, for publication in additional volumes of John Hawkesworth's edition of Swift's works (1766). Some of the remaining manuscripts later passed to Sir Walter Scott for use in his own Swift edition (1814). In 1765, for George Faulkner's projected quarto edition of Swift, which was never published, Lyon wrote his &#145;Materials for a life of Dr. Swift&#146;, arguably the most reliable of all early accounts of the dean, comprising extensive additions and corrections entered in a loosely interleaved copy of an earlier life by Hawkesworth. This volume next passed to the London editor John Nichols, who, without knowing its author or title, published Lyon's work in his 1779 supplementary volume to the Hawkesworth edition of Swift. By then a quarter of Lyon's original interleaved pages were missing, and several more were lost before the volume finally came into the possession of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The missing sections were published after the discovery in 1997 of a near complete early transcript.<br>
<br>Lyon passed most of his later career at the two Dublin churches where he began. St Bride's he served as incumbent after 1764, and at St Patrick's he was successively prebendary of Rathmichael (1751&#150;64), Tassagard (1771&#150;87), and Mulhuddart (1787&#150;90). From its inception in 1746 he served as secretary to the governors of St Patrick's Hospital, founded under Swift's will, and was elected a governor in 1773. A gifted antiquary, he built up an extensive archive of notes relating to Irish church history, using records that have since been largely destroyed. Much of his collection was later dispersed. &#145;Although Dr. Lyon did not, himself, publish any work on the subject of Irish antiquities,&#146; William Monck Mason remarked in 1819, &#145;there is no one to whom the Irish antiquarian is more indebted; to his diligence we chiefly owe the preservation of whatever remains of the ecclesiastical antiquities of Dublin&#146;  (Mason, lxiii). At St Mary's, Dublin, on 12 January 1754, Lyon married Sarah Hatfield (<i>d</i>. February 1790), who apparently brought him a modest fortune and some connections in the church hierarchy. He died, without surviving issue, in Dublin in June 1790 and was buried on the 12th in St Patrick's churchyard.<br>
