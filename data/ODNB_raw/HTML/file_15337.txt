<span class="headword">Kempe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brunham]</span>,  Margery</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1373, <em>d.</em> in or after 1438), <span class="occ">visionary</span>, was the author of the earliest surviving autobiography in English. She was born at Bishop's Lynn, Norfolk, the daughter of John Brunham (<i>d</i>. 1413), merchant, who was five times mayor and six times MP for Lynn between 1364 and 1391. The identity of Kempe's mother is unknown. At about twenty she married John Kempe, the younger son of a Lynn skinner, also called John (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1393). John Kempe the younger was admitted to the freedom in 1393, and was a chamberlain of Lynn in 1394. He is recorded as a brewer in 1403&#150;5. Margery Kempe became pregnant soon after their marriage, and when the child was born she experienced a severe post-partum depression, lasting for eight and a half months. She was finally cured when Jesus appeared and sat at the end of her bed, speaking words of comfort. This marked the beginning of her conversion, though Kempe continued for several years in her old way of life: she ran a brewing business which collapsed, and then a short-lived horse-mill. These failures convinced her that she was being punished for her sinfulness, and she embarked on a life of penance.<br>
<br>Almost everything known about Margery Kempe derives from her <span class="italic">Book</span>. Kempe could not write, but determined in the early 1430s to record her spiritual autobiography. She employed as amanuensis an Englishman who had lived in Germany, but he died before the work was finished, and his writing was anyway illegible. Kempe persuaded a local priest to begin rewriting on 23 July 1436, and on 28 April 1438 he started work on an additional section covering the years 1431&#150;4. Only one manuscript survives, now in the British Library (Add. MS 61823), and previously in the possession of the Butler-Bowdon family of Lancashire. It was copied about 1450 by an East Anglian scribe named Salthows, and later in the century was owned by the Yorkshire Carthusian priory of Mount Grace. Until the manuscript was identified by Hope Emily Allen in 1934, Kempe's <span class="italic">Book</span> was known only from excerpts printed by Wynkyn de Worde <i>c</i>.1501, and by Henry Pepwell in 1521 (where the author is described as &#145;a devoute ancres&#146;). The <span class="italic">Book</span> was first published complete in 1936, in a version in modern English by William Butler-Bowdon. A critical edition for the Early English Text Society by Sanford Brown Meech and Hope Emily Allen followed four years later. Other versions have followed since, including one in the <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span> series in 1985.<br>
<br>The chronology of Kempe's life is unclear from her <span class="italic">Book</span>, and few events, including her encounters with authority, can be documented from other sources. She had another thirteen children before she finally persuaded her husband, in the summer of 1413, to agree that they should live chastely. Kempe then sought permission from Philip Repyndon, bishop of Lincoln, to become a vowess and wear the characteristic mantle and ring, to which she proposed adding white clothes symbolizing her spiritual purity. Repyndon sent her to Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, who received her kindly, but it is not certain that she took a formal vow. Possibly that year, Kempe visited Julian of Norwich to seek reassurance about the authenticity of her visions. Later in 1413 she left Yarmouth on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, via Constance and Venice, living on alms. After reaching Jerusalem, she visited Calvary and the holy sepulchre, where she first manifested the uncontrollable crying which for many years was to be the hallmark of her devotion. She travelled in the Holy Land before re-embarking for Venice, and then went to Assisi and Rome, where she wore white clothing, and where her roaring in church caused much hostility. Throughout this period Kempe had frequent visions, which included a mystical marriage to the Godhead in Rome. While there she met a former servant of the visionary St Bridget of Sweden. She returned to England after Easter 1415.<br>
<br>Back in Lynn, Kempe was a source of scandal, with her white clothing and noisy weeping. In 1417 she set off again on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. While waiting for a ship in Bristol she was welcomed into the household of Thomas Peverel, bishop of Worcester, who had known her father and treated her as a holy woman. On her return from Spain she visited the shrine of the holy blood at Hailes, in Gloucestershire, and then went on to Leicester. The political climate, in the aftermath of Oldcastle's revolt of 1414, was not favourable to unusual styles of religion. Earlier, in Canterbury, Kempe had been called a Lollard and threatened with burning by people in the street; here she was brought before the mayor, charged with Lollardy, and imprisoned. After being harassed, verbally and sexually, by the steward of Leicester, she was examined on the eucharist in the mayor's presence by the abbot of the town's Augustinian house, and by the dean of Leicester. She was pronounced orthodox, and made her way to York. Here her white clothing, her sobbing during communion, and her following in the city once more made her suspect. She was examined by minster clergy and then brought before the archbishop of York, Henry Bowet, at Cawood, where she was again accused of heresy and again found to be orthodox. Bowet had her escorted out of the area, but she was rearrested by royal authorities and taken to Beverley. Bowet released her again and gave her a letter certifying her orthodoxy. Once across the Humber she was arrested yet again and released, before going to London to secure a letter from Henry Chichele, archbishop of Canterbury, allowing her frequent access to confession and communion. She returned to Lynn some time in 1418.<br>
<br>Several years of painful illnesses followed, which made Kempe less mobile than before. The intense spiritual life recorded in her <span class="italic">Book</span> includes extended visions, conversations with Jesus, and bouts of noisy crying. A priest read works of contemplation to her over a period of years, including the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and commentaries, the <span class="italic">Revelations</span> of St Bridget, Walter Hilton's translation of the <span class="italic">Stimulus amoris</span>, and the <span class="italic">Incendium amoris</span> of Richard Rolle. She also knew of Marie d'Oignies (<i>d</i>. 1213) and Elizabeth of Hungary (<i>d</i>. 1231). Although much criticized, she always had supporters among the clergy, including the Dominican anchorite of Lynn, himself a visionary, her parish priest, Robert Springolde, who succeeded the anchorite as her principal confessor, Thomas Hevingham, prior of the Benedictine monastery in Lynn, Richard Caister, vicar of St Stephen's, Norwich, and William Southfield, Carmelite of Norwich, also a visionary.<br>
<br>In the 1420s Kempe lived apart from her husband. When he was accidentally injured, and later became senile, she nursed him until his death about 1431, in penance for her pleasure in his body when young. Their son, who lived in Germany, returned to Lynn with his wife and died, shortly before his father. In April 1433 Kempe left Ipswich, without her confessor's permission, to accompany her daughter-in-law back to Danzig. Their ship was blown off course to Norway, but eventually reached Danzig, from where Kempe travelled with difficulty to Wilsnack in Brandenburg to see the miraculous Holy Blood. Then she went to Aachen and its holy relics, and returned via Calais to London. She visited the Bridgettine abbey at Syon, probably in August 1434, where she received the Lammastide indulgence for pilgrims, and then returned to Lynn to be reconciled with her confessor. In 1438, when the <span class="italic">Book</span> was completed, a Margeria Kempe, who may be its author, was admitted to the prestigious Trinity Guild of Lynn. The date of Kempe's death is unknown.<br>
