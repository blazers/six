<span class="headword">Hart,  Thomas John</span>  (1907&#150;1970), <span class="occ">marine biologist</span>, was born on 17 September 1907 at Cintra Lodge, Little Shelford, near Cambridge, the eldest of the four sons of John Henry Arthur Hart (1876&#150;1952), theological lecturer and librarian of St John's College, Cambridge, and later a clergyman, and his wife, Katherine Mary Gwatkin (1873&#150;1961), who was an occasional schoolteacher in biology. The family had wide-ranging interests, especially in natural history and the sea, and spent holidays on their converted coal barge beached on Blakeney Point, Norfolk. Hart was educated at Lady Manners School, Bakewell, and Leeds University, where he graduated with first-class honours in zoology in 1929. Subsequently he was awarded the degrees of MSc in 1934 and DSc in 1935. On 17 June 1931 he married Edith Angood (1907&#150;1989), also a graduate in zoology from Leeds University. They later had three sons.<br>
<br>Immediately after graduating in 1929 Hart had joined the <i>Discovery</i> investigations, established by the Colonial Office for marine research around the Falkland Islands. He served on Royal Research Ship (RRS) <i>Discovery II</i> in the Southern Ocean on her first, third, and fifth commissions (1929&#150;31, 1933&#150;5, and 1937&#150;9). He also served on RRS <i>William Scoresby</i> in 1936&#150;7 and 1950. During the Second World War he was commissioned for a short time as lieutenant RNVR but was invalided out and continued his <i>Discovery</i> investigations work at Plymouth in the laboratories of the Marine Biological Association. In 1949 <i>Discovery</i> investigations were transferred to the newly established National Institute of Oceanography and Hart remained a member of its staff at Wormley until his death.<br>
<br>Hart's task on joining <i>Discovery</i> investigations was to continue work begun by A. C. Hardy on the phytoplankton of the Southern Ocean. His two major <i>Discovery</i> reports, &#145;On the phytoplankton of the south-west Atlantic and the Bellingshausen Sea, 1929&#150;31&#146; (1934) and &#145;Phytoplankton periodicity in Antarctic surface waters&#146; (1941), provided the foundations for subsequent investigations of phytoplankton ecology in Antarctic seas. In his later work he used the newly developed technique of colorimetric estimation of chlorophyll as a measure of total phytoplankton. The importance of his observation that dense phytoplankton growth followed the stabilization of the water column by melting of ice was fully recognized four decades later.<br>
<br>Hart distinguished different types of water by their diatom floras and described how a particular species could be used to trace water movements. A report &#145;On the diatoms of the skin film of whales&#146; (1935) showed that whales accumulate these films only in Antarctic waters and that their density is an index of the condition of the animal. Another <i>Discovery</i> report by Hart, on behalf of his late colleague E. R. Gunther, dealt with trawling surveys on the Patagonian continental shelf. A later paper, &#145;Some observations on the relative abundance of marine phytoplankton populations in nature&#146; published in <span class="italic">Some Contemporary Studies in Marine Science</span> (1966) summarized much information from his previous studies, together with that from ships' meteorological logbooks. In all Hart published some twenty-two scientific papers. In 1930 Hart and H. E. Marshall were the first people to land on Thule Island in the South Sandwich group. During the war Hart pressed for the continuation of work in the Antarctic and his efforts helped result in the establishment of the Falkland Islands dependencies survey. His last major work at sea was as scientist in charge of a whale-marking expedition in RRS <i>William Scoresby</i> in 1950, but he had to leave the ship early because of ill health.<br>
<br>Hart was a quiet, retiring man with a dry sense of humour, whose wide knowledge of marine science and Antarctic affairs was always available to others. Outside his work he enjoyed rowing, football, cricket, sailing, choir singing, chess, and woodwork. He was awarded the polar medal in 1940 and Hart Rock, off Laurie Island, South Orkneys, was named after him. He died of heart failure at his home, Sherborne, Petworth Road, Witley, Surrey, after returning from work on 4 May 1970. His ashes were consigned to the north Atlantic from RRS <i>Discovery</i>.<br>
