<span class="headword">David, Sir  Percival Victor David Ezekiel</span>, second baronet  (1892&#150;1964), <span class="occ">financier and collector of Chinese art</span>, was born in Bombay on 21 July 1892, the fifth and youngest child in the family of three sons (the elder two of whom died at the age of two) and two daughters of Sir Sassoon Jacob David, first baronet (1849&#150;1926), cotton and yarn merchant, mill owner, and later founder and chairman of the Bank of India, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49031/', "Elias David Sassoon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58221/', "Sassoon family")</script>] of Bombay. He was educated at Elphinstone College and Bombay University (BA, 1909), and succeeded his father as baronet in 1926. He married his cousin, Vere Mozelle, daughter of Abraham (Aubrey) David, financier, on 26 January 1913. They had two daughters, the younger of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>David was always reticent about his personal history, but his public renown grew with his status as collector of Chinese art and promoter of art study as a key to the understanding of the Chinese intellect. Active in his family's business, he visited China in 1927 and there resolved to devote his life to Chinese connoisseurship. His frequent presence in Peking (Beijing) afforded him unprecedented opportunities of acquisition among the art objects released on the market as the old social order of China broke down.<br>
<br>After joining in 1930 the Oriental Ceramic Society, founded in London a decade earlier, David began a career of scholarship with papers read to that body, distinguishing himself by identifying the imperial <i>ru</i> ware made between <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1107 and 1127. In 1930 he funded a lectureship in Chinese art and archaeology at the then School of Oriental Studies at the University of London. In 1931 central funding was made available by the university for a chair; however, in 1932 this was moved to the newly established Courtauld Institute of Art. David was the chief instigator and director of the international exhibition of Chinese art held in London at Burlington House in 1935&#150;6. It fulfilled his ambition of showing items from the Chinese imperial collection together with the best of Western collections. For the safety of transport from China the request of protection by the British navy was not thought inappropriate. The exhibition may be said to have motivated the adoption of Chinese art studies in Western universities.<br>
<br>The porcelains, stonewares, and books David had collected in China provided the contents of the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art which he gave to the University of London in 1950 and which was attached as his exclusive benefaction to the School of Oriental and African Studies in 1952, housed in a building, also his gift, at Gordon Square, Bloomsbury. A condition of the donation was that the university chair in Chinese art and archaeology should again be filled. The David collection has no rival outside China for post-Tang ceramics.<br>
<br>Captured by the Japanese in 1941, David was interned in Shanghai for nine months, and contracted the sclerosis which caused him difficult last years and finally ended his life.<br>
<br>David was made a DLitt by London University in 1950, became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and was an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. Following a divorce in 1953, David married on 15 October of the same year Sheila Jane Yorke, daughter of Arthur Yorke Hardy, mining engineer, of Harrow. They had no children and the baronetcy became extinct when David died on 9 October 1964 at 53 Gordon Square, London, of the sclerosis he had contracted in Shanghai. His last work, <span class="italic">Chinese Connoisseurship: the Ko Ku Yao Lun</span>, was published posthumously in 1971, and saw the first translation of the fourteenth-century album of connoisseurship <span class="italic">Gegu yaolun</span>.<br>
