<span class="headword">Cook <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Faringdon]</span>,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1539), <span class="occ">abbot of Reading</span>, was probably professed as a Benedictine monk before 1500. Born Hugh Cook, he subsequently adopted the arms of the Cook family of Kent, though his monastic surname suggests that he originated from Faringdon in Berkshire. He seems to have received his education entirely within the abbey, and, having previously served as sub-chamberlain, was elected abbot on the death of Thomas Worcester in September 1520. Almost at once he assumed the temporal duties expected of a mitred abbot, being placed alongside temporal landowners on commissions of the peace and other governmental commissions for Berkshire from 1526 to 1538.<br>
<br>During Faringdon's rule the grammar school attached to the abbey flourished greatly, attracting sons of the nobility and gentry who in 1534 included James Bassett, the son of Lady Lisle from an earlier marriage and stepson of Lord Lisle, the governor of Calais. About 1524 Edward Cox, the school's humanist master, published a treatise, <span class="italic">The Arte or Crafte of Rhethoryke</span>, which he dedicated to the abbot. In his last months of freedom in 1539 the abbot concluded a new teaching agreement between the abbey and Cox.<br>
<br>Midway between London and Oxford, and not far from Windsor, the abbey frequently received royal and academic visitors. Faringdon first entertained Henry VIII in January 1521, when the king made an oblation to the image of &#145;the Child of Grace&#146; at the monastery; by 1532 the abbot had been appointed one of the royal chaplains and in the autumn of 1537 he both sang a requiem mass for Queen Jane Seymour at Hampton Court and participated in her burial at Windsor.<br>
<br>In 1528 Thomas Garret stopped at Reading Abbey on route to Oxford, and sold a number of heretical books to the prior, John Shirbourne, who was subsequently imprisoned for a time in the Tower. Faringdon took firm action against his errant monk, refusing in 1532 to permit him to return to the abbey. He similarly showed little sympathy with three monks who later in the decade appealed to the bishop of Salisbury against Roger London, the abbey's anti-Lutheran divinity reader, and successfully withstood the bishop's attempt to impose Richard Cobbe, a married man and former priest, as divinity lecturer upon the house.<br>
<br>Faringdon appears always to have been conservative in his religions opinions, and was among the minority in convocation in April 1533 who believed the pope could dispense from the impediment of affinity with a brother's widow, even when the marriage had been consummated. Nevertheless, he still managed to retain the government's favour almost to the end. A frequent attender of the House of Lords, in 1530 he had signed the petition to the pope against the delay in the divorce proceedings, offering the king the use of his abbey's library to find arguments for the annulment of his marriage. He took the oath recognizing the royal supremacy, and in 1536 he acquiesced in the act authorizing the dissolution of the lesser monasteries, though this may have been in the hope that the greater houses might yet be spared. From at least 1534 the abbot had been paying an annuity of 20 marks to Cromwell. In 1537 Cromwell heard that the abbot had been associating with favourers of the bishop of Rome, but took no action against him. Early in 1538 the abbot and convent of Abingdon yielded their house to the crown, and when Cromwell's officials came to Reading to suppress the grey friars in the following September, they took the opportunity to draw up an inventory of the abbey's relics, at the same time commenting approvingly that there was a daily scripture lecture in the chapter house in Latin and English. On this visit Faringdon put himself at the king's command, but still took no steps to surrender his abbey.<br>
<br>In mid-August 1539, however, Cromwell received a report that Faringdon was selling the abbey's sheep, corn, and woods to the king's disadvantage. This seems to have precipitated his removal to the Tower on a charge of treason, and on 19 September, in his absence, crown officials suppressed the house.<br>
<br>Much speculation has arisen over the precise nature of Faringdon's sedition. The French ambassador believed the abbot had some complicity in the Exeter conspiracy, and certainly John Rugge, one of his associates, a former prebendary of Salisbury who had retired to the abbey, was closely connected with the Pole circle. The charges in Faringdon's indictment, however, relate exclusively to his religious opinions, alleging that on no fewer than three occasions he had upheld the papal supremacy. Together with Rugge and John Eynon, priest of St Giles, Reading, he was found guilty of treason and hanged before the abbey gatehouse on 14 November 1539. Since no members of the community were involved in Faringdon's treason the government allowed the monks of Reading their pensions at the dissolution.<br>
