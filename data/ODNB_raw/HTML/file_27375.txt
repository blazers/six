<span class="headword">Thorpe,  Benjamin</span>  (1781/2&#150;1870), <span class="occ">Old English scholar</span>, is of obscure origins. Nothing is recorded of his parentage, birth, early life, or education. Contemporaries refer only to his works, which are self-effacing. Having decided to study early English antiquities, then much neglected in Great Britain, Thorpe set out about 1826 to Copenhagen, attracted there chiefly by the fame of the great philologist Rasmus Christian Rask, who had recently returned from the East and been appointed professor of literary history at the Danish University. While he was living in Copenhagen he made the acquaintance of Mary Anne Ott&eacute;, whom he married. In 1830 Thorpe published at Copenhagen an English translation of the second edition of Rask's <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Grammar</span> (a second edition of this translation appeared at London in 1865). He took his wife and her daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35342/', "Elise Charlotte Ott&#233; (1818&#150;1903)")</script>, back to England in this same year. Thorpe taught Elise several languages, perhaps launching her lifelong interest in linguistics, but apparently their pedagogic relationship grew more taxing as time went on, and the increasing strain is certainly cited by Edmund Gosse as one of the reasons for Ott&eacute;'s departure for the United States in 1840, though E. S. Day denies the severity of Gosse's interpretation (Gosse, 15; Day, 83).<br>
<br>In 1832 Thorpe published <span class="italic">C&aelig;dmon's metrical paraphrase of parts of the holy scriptures in Anglo-Saxon; with an English translation, notes, and a verbal index</span>. This was hailed at the time as one of the best Old English texts yet issued. It was followed in 1834 by <span class="italic">The Anglo-Saxon version of the story of Apollonius of Tyre, upon which is founded the play of &#145;Pericles&#146;</span> and by <span class="italic">Analecta Anglo-Saxonica</span>, a useful anthology of Old English texts, which was promptly adopted by the Rawlinsonian professor of Old English at Oxford (Robert Meadows White). In this Thorpe sought to promote &#145;the study of the old vernacular tongue of England, so much neglected at home, and so successfully cultivated by foreign philologists&#146;  (Preface, iv). The <span class="italic">Analecta</span> was praised with discrimination by his peer John Mitchell Kemble, and up to 1876, when Henry Sweet's <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Reader</span> appeared, though beginning to be dated, it remained, with Vernon's <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Guide</span>, the chief book in use.<br>
<br>In 1835 appeared <span class="italic">Libri psalmorum versio antiqua Latina; cum paraphrasi Anglo-Saxonica &hellip; descripsit et edidit B. Thorpe</span> and then in 1840 Thorpe's well-known <span class="italic">Ancient Laws and Institutes of England</span>, which formed two volumes of &#145;supreme value to the student of early English history&#146; (Adams, 474; cf. <span class="italic">QR</span>, 281). Two more volumes were published by Thorpe in 1842, <span class="italic">The Holy Gospels in Anglo-Saxon</span> and <span class="italic">Codex Exoniensis: a Collection of Anglo-Saxon Poetry, with English Translation and Notes</span>. Next came, for the &AElig;lfric Society, <span class="italic">The Homilies of the Anglo-Saxon Church</span>, with an English translation, published in ten parts between 1843 and 1846). In recognition of the importance of all this unremunerative work, in 1835 Thorpe was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;160, which increased on 17 June 1841 to &pound;200 per annum.<br>
<br>As early as 1834 Thorpe had begun a translation of J. M. Lappenberg's works on old English history, but had paused, feeling the inadequacy of his own knowledge. By 1842 better informed, he began another version, with numerous alterations, corrections, and notes of his own. This was published in two volumes in 1845 as <span class="italic">A History of England under the Anglo-Saxon Kings</span>. It was followed in 1857 by a translation and revision of the same writer's <span class="italic">History of England under the Norman kings &hellip; from the battle of Hastings to the accession of the house of Plantagenet</span>. The literary introduction to both these works, though valuable, was largely superseded by the works of Kemble, and other later Anglo-Saxon scholars. Of more lasting importance was Thorpe's two-volume edition of Florence of Worcester, issued in 1848&#150;9 as <span class="italic">Florentii Wigorniensis monachi Chronicon ex chronicis ab adventu Hengesti</span>, collated and edited with English notes. In 1851, after a long negotiation with Edward Lumley, Thorpe sold to him for &pound;150 his valuable <span class="italic">Northern Mythology &hellip; from Original and other Sources</span> (3 vols.), a work containing meticulous notes and illustrations. Continuing in the same vein of research, he produced in 1853 his <span class="italic">Yule Tide Stories: a Collection of Scandinavian and North German Popular Tales and Traditions</span>, which appeared in Bohn's <span class="roman">Antiquarian Library</span>. For the same library he produced in 1854 <span class="italic">The Life of Alfred the Great</span>, a translation from the work by R. Pauli. In 1855 appeared Thorpe's <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Poems of Beowulf</span>, with translation, notes, glossary, and indexes. Kemble's literal prose translation had appeared in 1837, and Wackerbarth's metrical version in 1849, but Thorpe's text was collated with the Cottonian manuscript before Kemble's; and as the scorched edges of that manuscript, already &#145;as friable as touchwood&#146;, suffered further detriment very shortly after his collation, a particular value attaches to Thorpe's readings, which vary in many respects from those of his predecessor. In 1861 Thorpe gained the lasting gratitude of historical students by his &#145;excellent edition&#146; for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> of <span class="italic">The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, According to the Several Authorities</span>. Volume 1 prints synoptically the Corpus Christi, Cambridge, the Bodleian, and the various Cottonian texts, with facsimiles and notes; volume 2 provides a translation  (cf. <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 1861, 1. 653). Four years later, through the liberality of the antiquary and collector Joseph Mayer of Liverpool, Thorpe was enabled to publish his invaluable supplement to Kemble's <span class="italic">Codex diplomaticus aevi Saxonici</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Diplomatarium Anglicum aevi Saxonici: a Collection of English Charters, 605&#150;1066</span>. His last work, done for Tr&uuml;bner in 1866, was <span class="italic">Edda S&aelig;mundar hinns fr&ocirc;&eth;a: the Edda of S&aelig;mund the Learned, from the Old Norse or Icelandic</span>, with a mythological index and an index of persons and places, issued in two parts.<br>
<br>Thorpe, who was an FSA and a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Munich and of the Society of Netherlandish Literature at Leiden, spent the last twenty years of his life at Chiswick. He died at The Mall, Chiswick, aged eighty-eight, on 19 July 1870. Of his own generation he was the great exception to Kemble's charge against English scholars of apathy in relation to Anglo-Saxon literature and philology. His widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;80 in 1872.<br>
