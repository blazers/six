<span class="headword">Fisken,  William</span>  (1812&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and inventor</span>, was born on Gelleyburn Farm, near Crieff, Perthshire, on 16 September 1812, the son of Thomas Fisken, a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Gray. After attending school at the neighbouring village of Muthill, he studied for the ministry at St Andrew's College, under Professor Duncan. He then attended the University of Glasgow, and after 1843, the Divinity Hall of the Free Church. While there he taught at a school at Alyth, near his birthplace. Upon receiving licence in the presbytery of Dundee, he began his career as a preacher in the Free Church. He visited various places throughout the country, including the Orkney Islands, where he would have received a call had he cared to accept it. He was next sent to the presbytery at Newcastle upon Tyne, and preached as a probationer at the nearby village of Stamfordham, where in 1847 he received a call, and was duly ordained, ministering there until his death. As governor and secretary he did much to promote the success of the scheme of the endowed schools at Stamfordham.<br>
<br>Fisken and his brothers Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1815), a schoolmaster at Stockton-on-Tees, and David (<i>b</i>. 1802) studied mechanics. Thomas and he designed a steam plough. Messrs Fowler, implement manufacturers in Leeds, contested their claim to have invented the steam plough, but the Fiskens won the ensuing case. William Chartres of Newcastle upon Tyne, the Fiskens' solicitor, used to tell how the two brothers wrote to him on the same day about the final discovery, which they made independently but simultaneously, but that he received William's letter first. William also invented a potato-sowing machine, a safety steam boiler, a propeller, an apparatus for heating churches, and the &#145;steam tackle&#146;, patented in July 1855, which helped to make the steam plough practically useful. This system of haulage obtained second prize at the royal show at Wolverhampton and was exhibited in Scotland in 1852, at Carlisle in 1855, and at the show of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1863; but it had largely been superseded by the time of Fisken's death. It worked on the fly-rope system: an endless rope, set into motion directly by the flywheel of the engine, drove windlasses of an ingenious type, which set the mechanism in motion. Fisken was the author of two undated pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Cheapest System of Steam Cultivation and Steam Cartage</span> and <span class="italic">On the Comparative Methods of Steam Tackle</span> which gained the prize of the Bath and West of England Society.<br>
<br>Fisken was a man of liberal views, widely read, and popular with his contemporaries. On 8 September 1880 he married Mary Isabella (1843&#150;1907), widow of William Turnbull and daughter of John Tillman, shipowner. He died at his manse at Stamfordham, on 28 December 1883.<br>
