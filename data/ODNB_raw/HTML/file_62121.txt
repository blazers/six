<span class="headword">Conti,  Italia Emily Stella</span>  (1873&#150;1946), <span class="occ">actress and founder of the Italia Conti academy of theatre arts</span>, was born on 9 September 1873 at 265 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, the eldest child of Luigi Conti (<i>d</i>. 1884), lyric singer, and his wife, Emily Mary (1844&#150;1914), daughter of Henry James Castle (1809&#150;1891), professor of civil engineering at King's College, London. Luigi Conti was born in Italy and had sung in opera there before going to Paris. When the Germans invaded France in 1870, he made his way to England, where he gave singing lessons to earn his living. After Italia's birth the family moved to Duncannon House, Brighton. Five more children were born there: Ferdinand (<i>b</i>. 1875), Arthur Catalani (<i>b</i>. 1876), Evelyn Martheze (1877&#150;1931), Ad&egrave;le Bianca (<i>b</i>. 1879), and Guy Benevuto (1881&#150;1906).<br>
<br>Following their father's death in 1884, Italia Conti became a boarder at Kensington Academy; the boys, through their father's masonic lodge, received scholarships to Emmanuel School and Clapham grammar school, while Evelyn went to the Royal Masonic School. Their mother, needing a source of income, acquired a private school, Eversley, in Clapham Park Road, where she took in a dozen or so pupils as boarders. Her own children returned for the holidays and here Italia, aged fifteen, recruited her siblings and other children as actors, and their parents as audience, for her first stage performance&#151;of Shakespearian tableaux, followed by a children's play.<br>
<br>Now determined to become an actress, Italia Conti frequented the theatres and she became so enthralled with the productions of Ellen Terry and Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre that she wrote to Terry, and to her great delight was invited to call on the star in her dressing-room. Terry was impressed by Italia's enthusiasm and arranged for her to have lessons with Macklin, a former member of the Lyceum company. When the Lyceum was taken over by Augustin Daly and his American company, Italia secured a small walk-on part in <span class="italic">The Last Word</span>. It was her first paid role. She also learned about voice production from the comedian Adah Rehan. After a part in <span class="italic">Diplomacy</span> on tour, she spent the next few years appearing at venues around the country with various companies.<br>
<br>In 1911 the actor&#150;manager Charles Hawtrey, impressed by Italia's handling of children in the fairy scenes of <span class="italic">The Two Hunchbacks</span>, invited her to train children for the first production of <span class="italic">Where the Rainbow Ends</span>, a Christmas play for children, set to Roger Quilter's incidental music. The play was a great success, and after its run the children begged Italia to continue their training. She gave up most of her own acting, and recruited her sister Bianca to help her. Thus, informally, the Conti stage school came into being, its first studio being in a basement room under a public house. The children thrived on her teaching, and she found them employment. A second <span class="italic">Rainbow</span> season was equally successful, and the school moved to a gymnasium at the Passmore Edwards settlement in Tavistock Square. Overwork and pleurisy drove her into a nursing home in 1918, but she was able to sit on a government advisory committee dealing with regulations affecting children on the stage. At her urging, under the act of 1921 licensing was transferred from the magistrates to the local authority, and this enabled travelling licences to be granted to children working in touring companies.<br>
<br>Between the wars the Conti school expanded. Bianca was joined by the ballet teacher Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Heyman and Grace Seppings, a former pupil; other friends and relatives joined the staff, while Italia dealt with auditions, contracts, rights, and arrangements for care of her charges while they were on tour. An operation for breast cancer in 1921 slowed her down only briefly. When Hawtrey died penniless in 1923 she bought his rights in <span class="italic">Rainbow</span>, which brought her a continuing income. She moved it to the Holborn Empire, installing her brother Ferdinand in a small office there as her business manager. Bertie Murray, husband of her sister Bianca, was stage manager. Bianca took classes at a studio in Paddington Street; Evelyn kept the accounts at Great Ormond Street.<br>
<br>In 1925 the Conti school moved to 15 Lamb's Conduit Street, where it occupied several rooms under the meeting place of the Ancient Order of Druids. Ruby, a young dancer who had been at the school since the age of nine, moved in as a companion to Italia and ran the household. In 1931, after Ruby left to get married, Italia moved to a modern house, named Evelyn Cottage after her recently deceased sister, on the clifftop at Southbourne, near Bournemouth. During the summer months her child pupils came down from London to enjoy the house and garden and her private beach. To replace Ruby, Arthur Conti's daughter Ruth, who was keen to take singing lessons, lived with her. Italia enjoyed an extremely busy social life, invited to every theatrical occasion: birthdays, presentations, first nights, and other celebrations. In 1937 she took a flat at 6 Russell Mansions, in Southampton Row. But with the outbreak of war and the mass evacuation of children, her world fell apart. The school closed, though a few of the children were taken to Bournemouth. Ruth and some of her other younger assistants were called up. In May 1940 bombs fell on Lamb's Conduit Street, destroying the studio; a few weeks later the Holborn Empire suffered a similar fate. With no income from pupils or rights, Italia faced financial ruin.<br>
<br>Within months, however, matters improved. Rooms were taken at Tavistock Little Theatre. Children began to return, classes restarted. Italia managed to keep <span class="italic">Rainbow</span> on the provincial road from 1941. In 1943 Ruby, whose daughter Hilary was now at school, was enticed back, to share teaching with Bianca. It was Ruby's idea to start an educational side, to harmonize all the teaching and theatre work, although Italia was not in favour of this. Touring the thirty-fifth production of <span class="italic">Rainbow</span> during the winter of 1945&#150;6, Italia caught a cold, which failed to respond to nursing. It progressed to pneumonia and she died, unmarried, at Evelyn Cottage a few days later, on 8 February 1946. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered at Southbourne.<br>
<br>Italia Conti was a lady of immensely strong character, passionately fond of children, and able to discern and develop their nascent abilities. Her pupils included No&euml;l Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Anton Dolin, Jack Hawkins, Hermione Gingold, Richard Todd, and Roger Livesey. The school continued to prosper after her death, in the hands of Bianca (who inherited the <span class="italic">Rainbow</span> rights), Ruth, and Hilary. Now the Italia Conti academy of theatre arts, it includes a school as well as performing arts studios and has links with the South Bank University.<br>
