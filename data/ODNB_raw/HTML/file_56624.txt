<span class="headword">Hasluck,  Frederick William</span>  (1878&#150;1920), <span class="occ">archaeologist and ethnologist</span>, was born at Eythan Lodge, Southgate, Middlesex, on 16 February 1878, the son of Percy Pedley Hasluck and his wife, Edith Louisa (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Battley). He was educated at the Leys School, Cambridge (May 1893&#150;July 1897), where he won a prize for his original drawings of Cambridgeshire antiquities. He then went to King's College, Cambridge, with a foundation scholarship, gaining a first in the classical tripos part one and (with distinction) part two, and thereafter a fellowship. He spent the years from 1899 to 1916 mainly in Greece and Anatolia. He was noted for his gentleness, refinement, and gift for friendship. His witty letters, very much influenced by the allusive style of Edward Lear, charmed his friends. Extracts of his letters to Richard Dawkins were published by his widow in 1926 as <span class="italic">Letters on Religion and Folklore</span>. He was well known in the Levant as a traveller and latterly as a student of the Bektashi order of dervishes then to be found in Albania, Serbia, and northern Greece. He was widely believed to know more of their customs and history than they did themselves.<br>
<br>In 1901 Hasluck became a student of the British School of Archaeology at Athens and in 1905 its librarian for one year. From 1905 to 1910 and again from 1911 to 1915 he was assistant director and librarian of the British School, building up the library holdings in early travellers and in medieval and post-medieval Balkan culture and history. On 26 September 1912 he married Margaret Masson Hardie (1885&#150;1948) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69310/', "Hasluck, Margaret Masson")</script>], who joined the British School in 1911, and who shared his interests in contemporary Balkan culture. They did not have children. In the same period he travelled widely in the Greek islands and in Anatolia with the school's director, Richard Dawkins. These travels resulted in more than fifty articles and three books, building on the fieldwork of Sir William Ramsay, with whom he often disagreed. Most of this work, dealing with medieval and modern Smyrna, the development of the monasteries of Athos, and Genoese and Venetian influences on the Aegean, remains of great value and some of it still the only work in the field. His study of the city of Cyzicus and its environs (<span class="italic">Cyzicus</span>, 1910) was his only foray into classical archaeology and, for its time, a model of competent field archaeology. It is still a starting point for any research on that area. His other books were <span class="italic">Athos and its Monasteries</span>, published posthumously in 1924, and, with H. H. Jewel, <span class="italic">The Church of Our Lady of the Hundred Gates at Paros</span> which appeared in 1920: both works are still consulted. In the spring of 1913 Hasluck visited Konia and became interested in the interrelationship of Christianity and Islam. The fruit of his labours was the monumental <span class="italic">Christianity and Islam under the Sultans</span>, published posthumously in 1929. It is a fine example of interdisciplinary research and writing notable not just for its arcane material but for the sensitivity, acumen, and sheer knowledge of its author. This was Hasluck's most important work. As a reference work it may be read as much for pleasure as for instruction.<br>
<br>Hasluck's knowledge of the Levant was put to use in the summer of 1915 when he joined the intelligence department of the British legation in Athens, working among the refugees who came to the city. Something of his work in this role as well as insights into his character may be gleaned from Compton Mackenzie's <span class="italic">First Athenian Memories</span> (1931). It was work which Hasluck did not enjoy and it certainly led to the breakdown of his health. In 1916 tuberculosis forced him to retire to France and in 1917 to a sanatorium, Beau R&eacute;veil, Leysin, Switzerland, where he died on 22 February 1920, a few days after his forty-second birthday.<br>
<br>He was survived by his wife, Margaret. After his death she spent much time researching in Albania, living at Elbasan until April 1939, and editing Hasluck's manuscripts for publication, in addition to her own books. There is a wall monument in Hasluck's memory in the Penrose Library at the British School in Athens.<br>
