<span class="headword">Clinton,  Henry Pelham Fiennes  Pelham-</span>, fourth duke of Newcastle under Lyme  (1785&#150;1851), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was the elder son of Thomas Pelham-Clinton, third duke of Newcastle under Lyme (1752&#150;1795), and his wife, Lady Anna Maria Stanhope (1760&#150;1834), fifth daughter of William Stanhope, second earl of Harrington. He was born at Walton, Essex, on 30 January 1785. His father held the dukedom from 22 February 1794 to his death, 17 May 1795, when Henry succeeded him. He was educated at Eton College (1796&#150;9), where he was appalled by its irreligion; in 1829 he founded the Newcastle scholarship there as a prize for divinity and classics. In 1803 he was abroad with his mother and stepfather when war with France was resumed; he was taken prisoner and detained at Tours for three years. After his return to England in 1806 he married, on 18 July 1807 at Lambeth Palace, Georgiana Elizabeth (1789&#150;1822), second daughter and heir of Edward Miller Mundy of Shipley, Derbyshire, and his wife, Georgiana, widow of Lord Middleton. She brought him a sum of &pound;190,000 and &pound;12,000 p.a. They had twelve children and she died aged thirty-three giving birth to twins, on 26 September 1822. Her death seems to have removed a stabilizing influence.<br>
<br>Newcastle was appointed to the usual offices appropriate to his station: lord lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in 1809, and in 1812 knight of the Garter and steward of Sherwood Forest and of Folewood, Nottinghamshire. But he was &#145;a manic-depressive, prone in periods of euphoria to see himself as the saviour of his country and to take impetuous initiatives only subsequently to lapse into long periods of despondency and inaction&#146;  (Wolffe, 23). From about 1826 he was one of the leaders of the tory &#145;ultras&#146; and a fervent opponent of Catholic emancipation, consequently condemning Wellington's government in 1829 and behaving like a radical agitator in trying to bring a crowd to Windsor to frighten the king with an anti-Catholic petition. He published a <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Kenyon</span> (1829) on this subject. He saw the reform proposals of 1830 as literally catastrophic, and became the most notorious of the opponents of the government's bill. In October 1829, when reproached for evicting tenants who voted against his candidate, he wrote publicly: &#145;Is it presumed then that I am not to do what I will with my own?&#146;  (Brock, 63), a remark he repeated in the Lords on 3 December 1830. He was reported as making further politically motivated evictions in September 1830, which led to the rebuke from <span class="italic">The Times</span> (29 September 1830) that his actions did much more to justify reform than to prevent it. Newcastle was already unpopular in Nottingham for leasing land only to members of the Church of England. On 10 October 1831, in one of several local incidents, a crowd burnt to the ground his mansion, Nottingham Castle (never rebuilt); he fortified his house at Clumber, and the windows of his London house in Portman Square were broken by a crowd. He complained bitterly at not being a member of the special commission to inquire into the Nottingham episode. Newcastle was one of twenty-two peers to vote against the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> on its third reading on 4 June 1832. He published his views of the catastrophe in <span class="italic">An Address to All Classes and Conditions of Englishmen</span> (1832). As a result of the bill he lost the patronage and interest of six boroughs, worth, he believed, about &pound;200,000.<br>
<br>Newcastle had used his patronage in the cause, as he saw it, of establishmentarian protestantism. After 1832 he maintained this objective. On his son Lord Lincoln's recommendation he gave the young tory W. E. Gladstone his first seat&#151;Newark, which was still effectively a nomination borough. He strongly opposed the grant to Maynooth College, and when Gladstone voted for the grant in 1845, withdrew the nomination, though they continued to share a detestation of concurrent endowment. He presented Protestant Association petitions to the Lords and vehemently opposed the <span class="roman">Diplomatic Relations [with Rome] Bill</span> in 1848. In Nottinghamshire he was equally energetically establishmentarian and in 1839 was dismissed as lord lieutenant following his behaviour over the appointment of two nonconformists as magistrates.<br>
<br>Newcastle had no more success as a landowner than as a reactionary. His estates, though in a prosperous and burgeoning county, declined and he left his heir a wasting inheritance. In 1833 he paid &pound;70,000 for an estate in Cardiganshire and in 1839 &pound;370,000 for Worksop Manor, which proved a bad investment. In two years in the 1830s he spent &pound;450,000, most of it borrowed, on land in Nottinghamshire. He ended his life estranged from most of his children, including his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5686/', "Henry Pelham Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, fifth duke of Newcastle")</script> and colonial secretary. Suffering from typhus in January 1851, he is said narrowly to have escaped being buried alive when in a coma. He died at Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire, on 12 January of that year and was buried in nearby Markham Clinton church on 21 January, having gained the reputation of representing all that was worst about the English aristocracy.<br>
