<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Panufnik, Sir  Andrzej</span>  (1914&#150;1991), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born on 24 September 1914 in Warsaw, the younger son of Tomasz Aleksander Panufnik (1865&#150;1953), who had trained as an engineer but who became Poland's finest stringed instrument maker, and his wife, Matylda Maria Thonnes (1883&#150;1945), daughter of Jan Thonnes and his wife, Henryka Szuster. Both parents were Polish; however, Jan Thonnes's father was of part English and half Polish descent. Andrzej's elder brother, Miros&#322;aw 
    (Mirek; 1910&#150;1944)
  , was reading mathematics at the University of Warsaw when his studies were interrupted by the Second World War; he served valiantly in the underground and was killed during the Warsaw uprising.<h2>
<a name="Poland"></a>Poland</h2>A frail child, Panufnik experienced the generally benevolent neglect of his parents and formed a close attachment to his maternal grandmother, Henryka, who became his first piano teacher. Following kindergarten he attended a succession of secondary schools in Warsaw: the Lorentz Gimnazjum (1924&#150;5), the Szko&#322;a Mazowiecka (1925&#150;7, interrupted by typhoid), and the Municipal Gimnazjum (1927&#150;9). He was enrolled as a junior student at the Warsaw conservatory in 1925 but, through a bout of nerves, failed his public performance examination at the end of the academic year and was advised to abandon any hope of a career in music. He reluctantly chose engineering as a profession and attended the State Engineering School, Warsaw, from 1929 to 1930; but after increasing disillusionment and depression he finally acknowledged that music was his true vocation. His parents agreed to support his decision provided that he first return to the Municipal Gimnazjum to complete his <i>matura</i> (1930&#150;32). Dividing his time between academic studies and preparation for the entrance examinations at the conservatory, he also began to compose jazz pieces influenced by Gershwin and Ellington. One of these, &#145;Ach pardon&#146;, a foxtrot with lyrics by Marian Hemar, became a hit for Adolf Dymsza; his next song with Hemar, &#145;I want no more&#146;, was also a success, but Panufnik's love of serious music soon ended the collaboration.<br>
<br>Owing to his lack of formal musical training and technique, Panufnik managed to secure a place at the Warsaw conservatory only as a part-time percussion student in February 1932. Nevertheless he had advanced enough to enter the conservatory as a part-time student in the autumn, studying in the faculty of theory and composition. By 1936 he graduated in half the usual time as both composer and conductor, and he was awarded by unanimous decision the highest honour of a diploma with distinction. As a laureate of the conservatory, he conducted the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra in the premi&egrave;re of his <span class="italic">Symphonic Variations</span>. He then obtained a grant from the state-run Foundation for National Culture to study conducting with Felix von Weingartner in Vienna. Called up for national service, he was forced to postpone his plans until 1937. Weingartner proved to be an inspirational teacher, but the Anschluss brought his studies to an end.<br>
<br>After returning to Warsaw, Panufnik secured a commission to compose and direct the music for a film by Stanis&#322;aw Wohl and Eugeniusz C&#281;kalski, <span class="italic">Ghosts</span>; the fee enabled him to travel to Paris to study conducting with Philippe Gaubert. After six months he travelled to London in March 1939; unimpressed by the &#145;dull and conservative&#146; programmes of music  (Panufnik, <span class="italic">Composing Myself</span>, 91), he turned to studying the works of eighteenth-century English composers at the British Library&#151;an experience that later proved of great value during his career as a conductor.<br>
<br>Although urged to remain in England with war impending, Panufnik returned to Poland. Following the surrender to Germany on 1 October, the dreadful economic conditions forced him to abandon all thoughts of serious composition. He entered into a three-year partnership with Witold Lutos&#322;awski as a piano duo in artistic caf&eacute;s, and was active in the underground, composing (under a pseudonym) patriotic songs, notably &#145;Warszawskie dzieci&#146; (&#145;Warsaw children&#146;). His <span class="italic">Tragic Overture</span>, the first of his compositions to explore the small-cell method that later became characteristic of his music, was composed during the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto in 1943. By moving his mother to a safe place outside Warsaw, he inadvertently escaped the worst effects of the 1944 uprising. In May 1945 he returned to Warsaw to arrange a proper interment for his brother. During his stay he discovered that all his manuscripts had been mistaken for rubbish and had been burnt by the new occupants of his apartment.<br>
<br>Having secured accommodation for his family in Cracow in 1945, Panufnik took up the position of musical director of the Polish army film unit based at &#321;&oacute;d&#378;. At the request of the ministry of culture he also became musical director and conductor of the Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra. He helped to found Polskie Wydawnictwo Myzyczne (PWM), the state music publishing house, and his method of substituting blank spaces for staves with rests in music printing was adopted in the interest of musical clarity; this innovation found favour with many modern composers and became a standard feature of musical notation. He returned to composition and reconstructed from memory the <span class="italic">Tragic Overture</span>, <span class="italic">Five Polish Peasant Songs</span>, and the piano trio.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1946 Panufnik was appointed director of the newly reconstituted Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra; he also represented Poland at the International Festival of Contemporary Music, and conducted concerts in Paris and Z&uuml;rich. He resigned his post with the Warsaw Philharmonic and returned to Cracow in 1947 in protest at reneged promises of accommodation for musicians from outside the capital and the failure to provide a permanent venue. His first major post-war composition, <span class="italic">Nocturne</span>, won the Karol Szymanowski competition in 1947. In 1948 he was appointed to the governing body of the Composers' Union and elected vice-president; his vocalise <span class="italic">Hommage &agrave; Chopin</span> of the same year was commissioned by UNESCO in Paris for the centenary of Chopin's birth.<br>
<br>Tragically, the blossoming of Polish art was to be short-lived, as Stalinist doctrine was imposed across eastern Europe. Panufnik was forced to accept an appointment to the bogus Polish committee of the defence of peace, and soon afterwards the general assembly of Polish composers was forced to embrace Stalinist cultural doctrine by which all artistic endeavours were expected to serve an ideological purpose; modernism was condemned and socialist realism became the only official means of expression. Initially, confusion over the definition of socialist realism allowed composers a certain latitude, and Panufnik's first major post-war symphonic work, the <span class="italic">Sinfonia rustica</span>, gained the first prize at the Chopin competition in Warsaw in 1949. Nevertheless, in a complete reversal of official policy, it was judged &#145;formalistic&#146; and was expunged from the state-approved repertory. After moving back to Warsaw in 1950, Panufnik met Marie Elizabeth (Scarlett) Rudnicka (<i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Mahoney), and he married her the following year. They had one daughter, Oonagh.<br>
<br>With the banning of the <span class="italic">Sinfonia rustica</span>, Panufnik's musical focus shifted largely to the reconstruction and adaptation of early Polish music, although he was still seen by the authorities as Poland's foremost composer and conductor; he was awarded state laureates in 1951 and 1952 even though he steadfastly refused to join the Communist Party. With the combination of conducting and administrative duties, and the increasingly repressive regime, he found little time or inclination to compose works other than those for his continuing job with the film unit. In 1953 he was coerced into being named leader of the cultural delegation to China and conducted a series of concerts of approved music, including two in the presence of Mao Zedong. However, the death of his daughter forced him to return prematurely to Warsaw.<h2>
<a name="England"></a>England</h2>With personal despair added to his concern at the plight of Polish artists, Panufnik concluded that he could best serve the cause of Polish artistic freedom by defecting. With help from colleagues in the West he was invited to Z&uuml;rich; after successfully slipping his minders, he arrived in London on 14 July 1954 and sought asylum. This was granted, and he was naturalized in 1961.<br>
<br>Panufnik's publishing contract (1955) with Boosey and Hawkes Ltd marked the beginning of a lifelong association with the firm. In 1956 he received a BBC commission for the tenth anniversary of the Third Programme: <span class="italic">Rhapsody</span> (performed in January 1957) included an invented hybrid rhythm based on Polish dances&#151;the <i>Krakowiak</i> (binary) superimposed on the <i>Mazurek</i> (ternary). Financial considerations led to his accepting the post of musical director and conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra for the seasons 1957&#150;8 and 1958&#150;9; during his fruitful tenure he raised the orchestra to international standards. Living in Birmingham, however, led to irreparable strains on his marriage, which ended in divorce in 1958.<br>
<br>In 1959 Panufnik received the Feeney Trust commission for his piano concerto and conducted the premi&egrave;re of the BBC commission <span class="italic">Polonia</span> at the Promenade Concerts. However, with the almost exclusive emphasis on serialism instituted by the new BBC controller, William Glock, Panufnik's music disappeared from programming for almost a decade; the irony of this happening in the country in which he had sought asylum was not lost to him. The next three years proved an unsettled time, during which he composed only <span class="italic">Autumn Music</span>. He gave up his flat in London and undertook conducting engagements abroad in 1960; on his return to England he lived in a series of small villages as well as spending time in France and Spain.<br>
<br>Early in 1961 Panufnik received a fellowship of the (Polish&#150;American) Ko&#347;ciuszko Foundation to compose a symphony for Poland's millennium in 1966 and began work on <span class="italic">Sinfonia sacra</span>, destined to be one of his most popular and enduring works. In 1963 the symphony, inspired by the earliest known Polish hymn, &#145;Bogurodzica&#146;, was awarded the prix de composition Prince Rainier de Monaco, and was placed first of 133 entries from thirty-eight countries. On 27 November that year Panufnik married the author and photographer Camilla Ruth Jessel (<i>b</i>. 1937), daughter of Commander Richard Frederick Jessel, a much decorated Royal Navy officer. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>With his second marriage, and a settled life near the Thames in Twickenham, Panufnik felt that he could no longer draw on his Polish roots and withdrew from composition for almost four years in the search for a new, original means of expression. It was only in 1968 that he fully devised the small-cell method of composition, out of which all his later works were derived; a limited number of intervals with their permutations and transpositions were employed as the basic building blocks from which large-scale compositions could be created. Pope's <span class="italic">Universal Prayer</span> provided the inspiration for his first full-scale use of small-cell composition; the violin concerto, commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin, followed in 1972. The chance encounter with tantric philosophy not only provided the inspiration of a BBC television commission (<span class="italic">Triangles</span>) but also led to a fully integrated system of composition combining the small-cell method with the perfection of geometric form. From this point each work would draw on a pre-prepared structure&#151;an &#145;unseen skeleton&#146; from which the music, &#145;unfrozen architecture&#146;, would grow.<br>
<br>The first half of the 1970s saw the composition of the <span class="italic">Sinfonia concertante</span> (1973) and the <span class="italic">Sinfonia di sfere</span> (1975). Through recordings, leading choreographers too began to discover and make use of Panufnik's music. His growing confidence with his almost structuralist method of composition was almost certainly spurred on by the fortuitous relaxations of restrictions on broadcasting his works by the BBC and of censorship in Poland where, at the insistence of the Polish Composers' Union, the <span class="italic">Universal Prayer</span> was performed at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1976. From that year, major works appeared annually, including the <span class="italic">Sinfonia mistica</span> (1976), <span class="italic">Metasinfonia</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">Concerto festivo</span> (1979). The growing recognition of his works in Poland encouraged him once again to draw inspiration from his native land, albeit transformed through his personal musical language. In 1980 the <span class="italic">Sinfonia votiva</span>, dedicated to the Black Madonna of Cz&#281;stochowa, was commissioned for the Boston Symphony Orchestra's centennial in 1982. During the period of composition Panufnik also produced chamber works including the string quartet no. 2 (&#145;Messages&#146;) of 1980, based on childhood memories of the sounds of wooden telegraph poles vibrating in the wind.<br>
<br>In 1983 Panufnik was selected as the first laureate of the prix Prince Pierre de Monaco in recognition of his entire &#339;uvre. He continued to conduct, primarily premi&egrave;res of his own works and the works of Mozart. For his seventieth birthday celebrations in 1984 he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra; in that same year he was made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music, London. The crowning achievement of the year was the New York premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Arbor cosmica</span>; commissioned in 1982 by the Koussevitsky Foundation, this piece&#151;with its underlying structure reflecting both Panufnik's lifelong love of trees and the metaphoric &#145;cosmic tree&#146;&#151;remains one of his most popular works.<br>
<br>The second half of the 1980s marked the final flowering of Panufnik's genius, beginning with the bassoon concerto (1986), the ninth symphony (<span class="italic">Sinfonia della speranza</span>, 1987), and <span class="italic">Harmony</span> (1989). The symphony no. 10 marked Panufnik's decision no longer to title his works; a joint centennial commission by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Sir Georg Solti, the work was premi&egrave;red in 1990, with the composer conducting. Later that year, following the collapse of communism, Panufnik made a triumphal return to Warsaw after thirty-six years of exile, conducting the Warsaw Philharmonic in an all-Panufnik programme which opened the Warsaw Autumn Festival.<br>
<br>In 1991 Panufnik was knighted in the new year honours, and later in that year he received an honorary PhD from the Fryderik Chopin Academy of Music, Warsaw. Struggling with cancer, he continued to draw inspiration and comfort from both his music and his family. He made his final conducting appearance recording the symphony no. 9 and the piano concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra, and completed the cello concerto, commissioned by the same orchestra for Mstislav Rostropovich, a month before his death. He died at his home, Riverside House, Riverside, Twickenham, on 27 October, and was buried at Richmond cemetery on 5 November. He was survived by his second wife, Camilla, and their two children. He was posthumously awarded the knight's cross of the order of Polonia restituta by President Lech Wa&#322;&#281;sa.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Panufnik's compositions include a number of fine chamber works as well as short orchestral pieces. He published a short pamphlet, <span class="italic">Impulse and Design in my Music</span>, in 1974, documenting the underlying theoretical structures of several major works. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Composing Myself</span> (1987), presented a vivid account of his eventful life; written from memory because Polish documents were inaccessible, it is remarkably accurate.<br>
<br>Many younger American composers came to regard Panufnik as one of the originators of minimalism; however, this arose from an erroneous perception of the small cell as a compositional tool. Unlike the minimalists, Panufnik constructed large and complex structures from small phrases; moreover, the small cell represented an inspirational point of departure rather than rigidly dominating his compositional method. He was firm in his refusal to attach himself to any school of composition, developing a unique musical language. His works helped to revitalize the symphony and advanced it at a time when its very validity was being called into question. Much of his sensitivity to orchestral forms stemmed from his broad experience as conductor; by all accounts he could have enjoyed an international career at the highest level in the latter profession, but he was firm in his conviction that composition was his calling. He remained true to this conviction throughout his life, declining several important commissions for operas, ballets, and films because he did not feel comfortable with that genre.<br>
<br>Despite enjoying a wide social life, Panufnik was a very private person when it came to his music and never took on any students of composition. He eschewed all forms of self-promotion, preferring his works to stand or fall on their own merits. Despite his feeling uncomfortable posing for photographs, many fine examples, primarily taken by Lady Panufnik, exist. These show a handsome, classically Slavonic face, and great sensitivity tempered by a hearty sense of humour. Despite the vicissitudes of his life before settling in England, the child of early surviving photographs is easily recognizable in those of his maturity.<br>
