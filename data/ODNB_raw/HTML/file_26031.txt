<span class="headword">Sondes,  George</span>, first earl of Feversham  (1599&#150;1677), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in November 1599 at Lees Court, in the parish of Sheldwich, near Feversham in Kent, the son and heir of Sir Richard Sondes (1571&#150;1645) of Throwley in the same county and afterwards of Lees Court, and his wife, Susan, daughter of Sir Edward Montagu (1532&#150;1602) of Boughton in Weekley, Northamptonshire. He was of an old Kentish family, and his grandfather Sir Michael Sondes lived in Sheldwich from 1576 to 1587. George was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he entered in 1615 and where his tutor was Dr Preston, but he does not appear to have proceeded to a degree. On 10 September 1620 he married Jane (1603&#150;1637), daughter and heir of Ralph Freeman of Aspeden, Hertfordshire, lord mayor of London in 1633&#150;4. They had three children&#151;Freeman, who died in infancy, George, and a younger son, also called Freeman. Sondes was created KB on 1 February 1626 upon Charles I's coronation, and he represented Higham Ferrers in Northamptonshire in the parliament of 1628&#150;9, while as a staunch royalist he was made sheriff of Kent in 1637&#150;8. He sought election as knight of the shire in 1640, but failed. On the outbreak of the civil war he was named a deputy lieutenant for Kent, and was on the royalist committee for the county in 1643, despite having resolved, as he later claimed, &#145;to sit still, and not do&#146;  (Ferris, 457).<br>
<br>When the parliamentary cause proved triumphant Sondes suffered greatly in his estate, and was imprisoned from 1645, first in Upnor Castle and then in the Tower; he was released in May 1650, but not finally discharged until 25 June following, after compounding for his estate by a payment of &pound;3350. Altogether he computed that he lost not less than &pound;30,000 by the civil war. On his release, however, he began rebuilding Lees Court from the plans of Inigo Jones, but his pursuits were interrupted by a terrible calamity which befell him in 1655. On 7 August in that year his younger son, Freeman, a sullen youth of eighteen or nineteen, apparently actuated by jealousy, killed his elder brother, George, who was asleep in an upper room in Lees Court, by a deadly blow on the back of the head with a cleaver. The murderer, who at once apprised his father of his crime, was taken to Maidstone next day and arraigned at Maidstone assize on 9 August. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to death, and was hanged at Maidstone on 21 August, meeting his end with resignation. The fratricide proved a fruitful theme for the pulpit, and is still memorable on account of the curious pamphlet literature that it evoked. Robert Boreman at once issued <span class="italic">A mirrour of mercy and judgment, or, An exact true narrative of the life and death of Freeman Sonds, esq.</span> (1655). Other ministers and godly men of the vicinity, less compassionate than Boreman, traced the &#145;visitation&#146; to Sondes's own moral remissness. He had failed (it was said) to continue the endowment of Throwley Free School as purposed by his father, had improperly executed the will of his father-in-law, Sir Ralph Freeman, and had generally mismanaged his sons' education. Sir George answered the charges with humility in a <span class="italic">Plaine Narrative to the World of All Passages upon the Death of his Two Sonnes</span> (1655); this is scarcely less steeped in religious sentiment than Robert Boreman's avowedly edifying tract. There followed from other pens <span class="italic">The devils reign upon earth: being a relation of several sad and bloudy murthers lately committed, especially that of Sir George Sonds his son upon his own brother</span> (1655) and <span class="italic">A funeral elegie upon the death of George Sonds, esq. &hellip; by William Annand Junior of Throwllgh, whereunto is annexed a prayer compiled by his sorrowful father</span> (1655).<br>
<br>On 25 February 1656 Sondes married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of Sir William Villiers, bt, of Brooksby. They had two daughters, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1657), who on 19 March 1676 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8309/', "Louis Duras, Baron Duras of Holdenby")</script>, and Katherine (<i>bap</i>. 1658), who married Lewis Watson in 1677. On the Restoration, Sondes was again appointed deputy lieutenant for Kent. In a bid to avoid forfeiture of property in consequence of his youngest son's felony, he returned to parliament for the first time in thirty-two years, representing Ashburton, Devon, from 1661 to 1676. An almost entirely inactive parliamentarian, it was due solely to the services of his son-in-law, Lord Duras, favourite and close confidant of the duke of York, that in 1676 he was created baron of Throwley, Viscount Sondes of Lees Court, and earl of Feversham, with remainder to Duras, who succeeded him when he died at Lees Court on 16 April 1677; Sondes was buried at Throwley on 30 April. Thomas Southouse had dedicated his <span class="italic">Monasticon Favershamiense</span> to him in 1671. Sondes's second son-in-law, Lewis Watson, in 1689 became Baron Rockingham, and upon the death of the second earl of Feversham was created Baron Throwley, Viscount Sondes of Lees Court, and earl of Rockingham (19 October 1714).<br>
