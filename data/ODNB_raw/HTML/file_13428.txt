<span class="headword">Hodgkin,  John</span>  (1800&#150;1875), <span class="occ">barrister and Quaker minister</span>, was born on 11 March 1800 in Penton Street, Pentonville, London, and grew up in Pentonville and in Tottenham. He was the youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13427/', "John Hodgkin (1766&#150;1845)")</script>, tutor and calligrapher, and Elizabeth Hodgkin, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rickman (1768&#150;1833). Both parents belonged to long-standing Quaker families. Their only other child to survive infancy was the medical writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13429/', "Thomas Hodgkin (1798&#150;1866)")</script>. Both boys (who were close friends all their lives) were educated at home, chiefly by their father. They received a thorough classical training and some knowledge of science. It was a sheltered upbringing, which John Hodgkin felt was responsible for his painful sensitivity as a young man. In his childhood and for the rest of his life periods of intense intellectual work alternated with ill health.<br>
<br>Advised by his family and by Joseph John Gurney (1788&#150;1847), Hodgkin chose to become a barrister rather than follow his father into teaching. In 1819 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn (where his Quaker principles made it necessary to ensure that his dues would not subsidize the chaplain and thus the established church) and from 1821 to 1824 he trained in the chambers of George Harrison, the first Quaker to be called to the bar. Hodgkin rarely appeared in court but had a large practice and was in considerable demand as a teacher. His specialism was conveyancing, and his chief concerns were clarity and concision: in an 1829 pamphlet he proposed simplifying the conveyancing process by setting up a general register of titles to property.<br>
<br>In 1829 Hodgkin married Elizabeth Howard (1803&#150;1836), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13928/', "Luke Howard (1772&#150;1864)")</script>, Quaker chemical manufacturer and meteorologist. Hodgkin credited her with vivifying his previously austere life, bringing him a conception of religion based on love rather than law. They lived in Tottenham and had four surviving children, including the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33915/', "Thomas Hodgkin (1831&#150;1913)")</script>. In 1836 Elizabeth Hodgkin died in childbirth.<br>
<br>The 1830s brought the Beaconite controversy: the Society of Friends divided over the perceived aridity of Quaker orthodoxy. Dissidents called for greater appeal to the emotions and less stress upon law. Hodgkin's marriage had connected him with Friends who left the society, but he remained a member and sought to synthesize the two approaches. Shortly after his first wife's death he urged reconciliation at his local meeting&#151;his first &#145;offering&#146;&#151;and in 1840 he was officially recorded as a minister.<br>
<br>The 1840s were a pivotal period for Hodgkin. In 1843 he married Anne Backhouse (1815&#150;1845); they had one child before her death of Bright's disease. Also in 1843 he retired from legal practice after a breakdown in his health, although he continued to advise Friends on legal matters and retained an interest in legal reform. Conversely, he poured energy into his activities as a minister, travelling frequently in this capacity. In 1850 and 1851 he was clerk to the yearly meeting in London. By the end of his life he had visited almost all the Friends' meetings of the United Kingdom and many abroad, always preaching strictly extempore and being noted for his empathy with the particular circumstances of his listeners.<br>
<br>In 1847 and 1849 Hodgkin visited the Friends' meetings in Ireland and in 1850 married Elizabeth Haughton (1818&#150;1904), an Irish Quaker. They had six children. Participation in Irish famine relief efforts (he took a particular interest in the fishing settlement of the Claddagh, near Galway) involved him in drafting the <span class="roman">Encumbered Estates Act</span> (1849) which aimed to encourage Irish landlords to invest in their properties, but he turned down a position administering the act.<br>
<br>In 1857 Hodgkin left Tottenham for Lewes in Sussex, his mother's home town. He remained energetic in the Friends' cause. A visit to the United States in 1861 coincided with the outbreak of civil war, in which Friends found themselves caught between the conflicting principles of anti-slavery and pacifism. In 1863 he went to Spain as one of a delegation to plead for imprisoned protestants. In November 1874 he suffered a stroke which left him paralysed. He died at Durley Dean in Bournemouth on 3 July 1875 and was buried at Winchmore Hill, Middlesex.<br>
