<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cross, Sir  Kenneth Brian Boyd</span>  (1911&#150;2003), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 4 October 1911 at The Rest, East Cosham, Fareham, Hampshire, the son of Pembroke Henry Cokayne Cross, an estate agent and surveyor, and his wife, Jeannie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boyd. He had three sisters and a younger brother, Ian. He was educated at Hilsea College, Portsmouth (1918&#150;27), and Kingswood School, Bath (1927&#150;8), where he played rugby for the first fifteen. He then worked at a Ford depot in Portsmouth until he was eighteen and could apply for a short service commission in the RAF. He was accepted and reported to the RAF depot at Uxbridge in April 1930 for a preliminary course, before being posted to 3 flying training school at Grantham, Lincolnshire. There he learned to fly on the Avro Trainer and Armstrong Whitworth Siskin. He played rugby for the station and gained his &#145;wings&#146; in April 1931, then was posted to 25 (fighter) squadron, which flew Siskins and subsequently Hawker Furies at Hawkinge, near Folkestone. He served with this squadron until November 1934, taking part in the 1933 and 1934 Hendon air displays.<br>
<br>From December 1934 Cross was at the Central Flying School at Wittering, near Stamford in Lincolnshire, training as an instructor. He also played rugby for Harlequins. When qualified he was posted in April 1935 to 5 flying training school at Sealand, near Chester, joining the Bulldog flight. He captained the station's rugby team in the 1935/6 season and was selected to play for the RAF. He was awarded a permanent commission in 1936 and by then had acquired his nickname, Bing, after Bing Crosby&#151;for, parallel with his reputation as fighter pilot and rugby player, he enjoyed a reputation as a man-about-town (with several girlfriends) and as a crooner at dances. In October 1938 he was promoted to squadron leader, then posted to 12 group headquarters, on the staff of Air Vice-Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Cross was given command of a Hurricane squadron, no. 46, based at Digby but operating from North Coates, taking over at the end of October 1939. In April 1940 he was sent to Norway by the assistant chief of the air staff (Air Vice-Marshal Sholto Douglas) to investigate the possibility of Hurricanes operating from Andalsnes, to support a Gladiator squadron (no. 263) mauled by the Luftwaffe. Although this mission was abortive it was his own squadron, no. 46, which was sent to Norway in May 1940&#151;with tragic consequences. Its Hurricanes, having been flown up to Abbotsinch, were hoisted aboard powered barges and taken down the Clyde to Greenock where the aircraft carrier HMS <i>Glorious</i> was anchored. They were then lifted by crane onto the flight deck. After some delays and a realization that there was tension between the captain, Captain Guy D'Oyly-Hughes, and his commander flying, Commander John Hughes, the Hurricanes made their first ever take-off from an aircraft carrier and landed at Sk&aring;nland&#151;moving from there to Bardufoss, which was a more suitable landing-ground. The squadron had several operational successes against the Luftwaffe, but on 24 May the British government decided to evacuate north Norway, and on 8 June the Hurricanes successfully landed on HMS <i>Glorious</i>&#151;as did the Gladiators of 263 squadron. With no forward reconnaissance the carrier and her two destroyer escorts were intercepted and sunk by the German battleships <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>. There were only seven survivors&#151;one of them Squadron Leader Cross. He described this horrifying episode in his autobiography, <span class="italic">Straight and Level</span> (1993). On 11 June they were picked up (one survivor dying later of gangrene) by a Norwegian fishing-vessel and taken to the Faroes, eventually reaching Rosyth on 18 June aboard HMS <i>Veteran</i>.<br>
<br>In September 1940 Cross was awarded the DFC; then, only partly recovered from his ordeal&#151;&#145;still encased in carpet slippers&#146;&#151;he was posted to 12 group air staff (operations and training), where he had &#145;a clear if remote view&#146; of the closing stages of the battle of Britain. When fit enough he resumed flying duties and requested a more active role, being posted to the Middle East&#151;to 252 wing at Alexandria, as wing commander. To get there he was instructed to sail by the aircraft carrier HMS <i>Furious</i> in convoy to west Africa, in charge of a consignment of forty Hurricanes which were to be delivered to Cairo. In January 1941 he led the first of the Hurricanes off the carrier to fly the short distance to Takoradi on the Gold Coast; then he flew in convoy (with a Blenheim leading) to Heliopolis, Cairo. He then took up his appointment in command of 252 (air defence) wing, and in July was promoted group captain. He made it clear, however, that he wished to be closer to western desert operations; and after the Eighth Army and western desert air force were formed in September 1941 he was posted to the latter as group training officer. He was involved in planning for operation Crusader, scheduled for 18 November. In September he was given command of 258 wing, and during the swirling battles which followed the failure of Crusader his skilful handling of his fighter squadrons and personal bravery earned him the immediate award of a DSO, the citation saying that he had displayed &#145;inspiring leadership&#146;&#151;and that &#145;in spite of his ground control duties&#146; he had consistently participated in air operations and his &#145;indomitable courage&#146; had contributed to the fighting skill of the force he commanded.<br>
<br>At the beginning of April 1942 Cross left the western desert to take up his former command, as air officer commanding 252 wing at Alexandria. After the battle of El Alamein and the Afrika Korps's retreat he was promoted to air commodore and given command of 212 group at Benghazi&#151;a short-lived appointment; for from February 1943 he was made air officer commanding 242 group&#151;the equivalent of the western desert air force with the British First Army. Its task after the capture of Tunis in May 1943 was to protect the First and Eighth armies in the invasion of Sicily. This was successfully accomplished by the middle of August, and on 2&#150;3 September the Eighth Army invaded Italy, whose forces surrendered on the 8th. At the end of September Cross was awarded an American decoration, the Legion of Merit, with the degree of commander. Like other battle-experienced Middle East leaders, he was then posted back to the UK&#151;to the allied expeditionary air force, from February 1944, to train RAF and USAAF squadrons in a ground-attack role in preparation for operation Overlord.<br>
<br>On 30 March 1944 the second great personal tragedy of Cross's life occurred, when his brother, Ian (a Wellington pilot with 103 squadron, who had been shot down when attacking <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> in their &#145;Channel dash&#146;, and subsequently made a prisoner of war), was one of fifty prisoners of war shot on Hitler's orders after the successful tunnel escape from Stalag Luft 3. More happily, on 15 January 1945, after a whirlwind courtship, Cross married Brenda Megan Powell, a WAAF officer, and daughter of Frank James Bickley Powell, RAF officer&#151;a marriage which was to last for fifty-seven years. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Cross was selected for the first post-war course at the Imperial Defence College, and in January 1947 was posted to the British forces of occupation in Germany, holding this appointment during the Berlin airlift, for which he was senior planner. After this tour he was appointed to command Horsham St Faith, a fighter station in 2 group, from July 1949; then in August&#150;September he took a flying refresher course at RAF Finningley, being subsequently appointed sector commander, eastern sector, from 1950 as an air commodore, until posted to the Air Ministry as director of operations&#151;a title later changed to director of operations (air defence). From February 1956 (as an air vice-marshal) he took up the first of two appointments at Bomber Command, though he had no experience of bombing operations. The air officer commanding-in-chief, Air Chief Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst, also had a fighter background: the idea was to energize the command, with its four-jet bombers, into a quick-reaction role as the spearhead of Britain's nuclear deterrent forces.<br>
<br>After three years as air officer commanding-in-chief 3 group Cross was appointed air officer commanding-in-chief Bomber Command, in May 1959. In that year's birthday honours he was appointed KCB; he had been made CBE in 1945 and CB in 1954. He brought the V-bombers and Thor missiles to their highest ever state of readiness during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and established a good professional and personal relationship with the USAF strategic air command. In September 1963 he relinquished his Bomber Command appointment, and in December of that year took up his last one, as air officer commanding-in-chief Transport Command. In that less stressful environment his reputation as a tough commander&#151;not only in the bomber world but also in some of the Second World War's crucial campaigns&#151;made an indelible impression.<br>
<br>Cross retired from the RAF in January 1967 and was active in the British Red Cross, serving as director first of the Suffolk and then of the London branch. On 4 September 1991 he suffered his third great personal tragedy, when his wife Brenda was murdered on the premises of the antiques business she ran with a partner. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Straight and Level</span> (written in conjunction with Vincent Orange), reflected his personal character&#151;honest, courageous, and unpretentious. He died on 18 June 2003 at Gorseway House, a retirement home in Hayling Island, Hampshire, following a stroke. He was survived by his three children.<br>
