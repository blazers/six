<span class="headword">Norwood,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1610&#150;1654), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, is of obscure origins: as yet no trace has been found of his father and mother. The family name was not uncommon and is found in Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Yorkshire, and particularly in Kent, from where it may have originated. Robert Norwood was put apprentice to Thomas Stocke of the Grocers' Company on 19 March 1628, and gained his freedom on 6 April 1636. In December 1639 Norwood began living at the sign of the Chequer in the parish of All Hallows, Bread Street, London. Some years later he claimed that before the calling of the Long Parliament he suffered imprisonment, seizure of goods, and long, tedious suits at the hands of Charles I and his privy council. He seems at this time to have shared mutual business interests with his elder brother (or perhaps cousin) the presbyterian John Norwood (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1602, <i>d</i>. in or after 1662), and to have acted on behalf of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20365/', "Richard Norwood")</script> of Bermuda. In September 1642 he signed the petition in favour of the appointment of Lazarus Seaman as rector of All Hallows, Bread Street. On 15 November 1642 Norwood was appointed a commissary of horse, and in the same month an assessor (Bread Street ward) for raising money for the defence of the kingdom. By the following summer he was commissioned as captain of a troop of horse in Colonel Edmund Harvey's regiment. His banner displayed a newly granted coat of arms and crest. It also carried the motto taken from <span class="roman">Zechariah</span> 4:7 of Zerubbabel's encouragement to finish the Temple, a device that may have been suggested by Thomas Goodwin's fast sermon of that name preached before parliament in 1642. Norwood's nominally sixty-strong troop of horse was mustered in London on 18 August 1643 and thereafter probably saw heavy fighting at the first battle of Newbury in September that year. In December, after further encounters with royalist troops, Norwood was stationed at the garrison town of Newport Pagnell with a nominally 48-strong troop of horse, besides officers. In May 1644 the troop was mustered again at Colnbrook. Norwood probably served with Colonel Harvey until June 1644, perhaps even later.<br>
<br>Following the new modelling of Harvey's regiment under the command of Colonel John Hurrey, Norwood was sent to the west of England as part of the spring campaign of 1645. Thereafter, he appears to have temporarily returned to civilian life. It was during this time that, by his own account, Norwood was &#145;threatned&#146; for publicly opposing &#145;the Scotish interest then on foot&#146;  (Norwood, <span class="italic">Case and Trial</span>, 20). In April 1648 he was one of several men appointed to bring in the arrears of the assessments for the army, and in February 1649 one of sixty-four men appointed to sit on the court for the treason trials of the five lords&#151;Norwood was one of the thirty-five men who on 6 March 1649 signed the warrant for the execution of James, earl of Cambridge (the duke of Hamilton). Norwood's services were also required as a cavalry officer in the Irish campaign of 1649. His troop seems to have been mustered in the spring of 1649, quartering at Chester before landing at Dublin on 26 July 1649. Commanding a nominally eighty-strong troop of horse, besides officers, Norwood may have supported Colonel Michael Jones's forces in their victory over the earl of Ormond at the battle of Baggotsrath. Four days later, on 6 August 1649, Norwood and his cavalry troop repulsed Sir Thomas Armstrong's forces in a skirmish outside Dublin. It is possible that Norwood was wounded in these engagements. In November 1649 it appears that he returned to England, perhaps docking at Liverpool. The following year, on 26 March 1650, Robert Norwood was made a member of the high court of justice. Despite incurring, by his own account, a &#145;just debt&#146; of about &pound;3000 in the state's service, Norwood at this time still appears to have been a relatively wealthy merchant  (Norwood, <span class="italic">Form of an Excommunication</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>). He had committed himself to a millenarian scheme to establish a utopia in the Bahama Islands, and seems also to have had interests in foreign trade. In common with a number of London merchants, Norwood was a congregant of Sidrach Simpson's gathered church that met at St Mary Abchurch.<br>
<br>On Thursday 25 April 1650 TheaurauJohn Tany, the self-proclaimed prophet and Lord's high priest of the Jews, issued a broadside. Its title was <span class="italic">I Proclaime from the Lord of Hosts the Returne of the Jewes</span>, and it is possible that Norwood may have helped pay towards its printing. Norwood was, at any rate, to contribute an epistle to another of Tany's works, <span class="italic">His Aurora in Tranlagorum in Salem gloria</span> (1651). On Sunday 13 April 1651 Tany addressed a large gathering at Norwood's house in the parish of St Mary Aldermary; similar concourses apparently followed. In March that same year members of Sidrach Simpson's gathered church, troubled by Norwood's &#145;erroneous opinions&#146;, had spoken with Norwood at his home  (Norwood, <span class="italic">Case and Trial</span>, 1). The following month, on 21 April 1651, Robert Norwood made a public profession of faith at St Mary Abchurch before the whole assembled church. Simpson, implacable, admonished Norwood for failing to repent his &#145;blasphemous Errors&#146; and excommunicated him from his church in early May  (Norwood, <span class="italic">Form of an Excommunication</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Afterwards, by his own account, Norwood was summoned before Oliver Cromwell, and there entreated by Joseph Caryl and John Owen to retract his errors. Evidently he was setting a bad example. Norwood, however, remained unrepentant. In June 1651 he was brought by warrant of Thomas Andrewes, lord mayor of London, before the bench at the sessions house in the Old Bailey. At the next sessions an indictment was prepared jointly against himself and Tany. The principal charges were that the two maintained that &#145;the soul [of men and women] is of the essence of God&#146; and that &#145;there is neither hell nor damnation&#146; (Norwood, <span class="italic">Case and Trial</span>, 9&#150;10; Norwood, <span class="italic">Brief Discourse</span>, title-page, 3&#150;4). On 20 June 1651 Norwood was removed from his place on the high court of justice by order of parliament. Five days later Norwood and Tany appeared at the Old Bailey and pleaded not guilty to the charges presented against them. Proceedings continued. Then on Wednesday 13 August 1651, after adjournments the two previous days, at 7 o'clock in the morning Tany and Norwood again appeared at the Old Bailey to answer the charges presented against them in the indictment. Norwood at the last wavered, and seems to have been ready to recant&#151;to no avail. The two were convicted of blasphemy by a jury of twelve men and sentenced to six months' imprisonment each in Newgate. Norwood was to intimate that his conviction owed much to the plotting of Thomas Andrewes, a long-time member of Sidrach Simpson's church, and another merchant, Alderman Stephen Estwick (<i>d</i>. 1657). Even so, it was on the charge of blasphemy that he became notorious.<br>
<br>Following their conviction for blasphemy, Tany and Norwood were committed to Newgate. The conditions for those that could not afford the services of the gaoler were intolerable. Norwood, it appears, was nearly financially drained by the experience. There followed a series of legal proceedings in the court of upper bench as Norwood brought forward a writ of error in an attempt to overturn the guilty verdict found against himself and Tany. The cardinal points of error in the writ were that two persons were not to be joined in one indictment&#151;&#145;their charge being severall&#146;, that judgment should not be given jointly, and that the defendants' alleged opinions fell outside the ambit of the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span>: Norwood and Tany had been convicted for supposedly saying that &#145;there is no hell nor damnation&#146;, whereas the act condemned only those that maintained that &#145;there is neither Heaven nor Hell, neither Salvation nor Damnation&#146;  (Norwood, <span class="italic">Brief Discourse</span>, 1, 4). Moreover, even though Norwood and Tany professed that the soul of man is of the essence of God, none the less the theological leap that the pair thus affirmed the mere creature to be very God had been provided by the framers of the indictment. On Tuesday 10 February 1652 the judges of the upper bench appear to have made their judgment. Chief Justice Henry Rolle rejected the writ.<br>
<br>On Monday 16 February 1652 Robert Norwood and TheaurauJohn Tany, having served their terms of six months' imprisonment, were each released upon &pound;100 bail&#151;pending good behaviour for one year. In Easter term 1652 Robert Norwood prosecuted a new writ of error in the court of upper bench. After several hearings the judges deferred proceedings until the following law term. And then on Monday 28 June 1652, in Trinity term, after two more hearings, the judges ordered that &#145;the Judgement&#146; against Norwood be reversed and the &#145;p[ar]tie restored&#146;  (TNA: PRO, KB 21/13, fol. 212<i>r</i>). Wary of setting a precedent, the judges of the upper bench had adhered to the strict letter of the law. Indeed, their decision to reverse the guilty verdict pronounced upon Norwood at the Old Bailey made manifest the discontiguous relationship between the <span class="roman">Act against Atheistical, Blasphemous and Execrable Opinions</span> and the supposed errors of doctrine propagated on the streets and public places of London: Tany and Norwood were convicted by inferring and taking out of context the true sense and meaning of their words, thereby making their opinions rigidly conform to the strictures of the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Act</span> of August 1650.<br>
<br>Following their release from Newgate, relations between Tany and Norwood appear to have cooled. Norwood, it seems, may have believed that the spirit of God had deserted Tany. During this period he wrote one pamphlet in which he advocated the readmission and toleration of the Jews and two other works, both published in the summer of 1653. These last two tracts, the one entitled <span class="italic">A Pathway unto England's Perfect Settlement</span>, the other <span class="italic">An Additional Discourse</span> (both printed by Richard Moone), were concerned with constitutional theory, and in part derived from John Sadler's <span class="italic">Rights of the Kingdom, or, Customs of our Ancestours</span> (1649). <span class="italic">England's Perfect Settlement</span> was dedicated to Oliver Cromwell. It bears some resemblance to &#145;Mr. Norwoods proposalls for settlement&#146;, an undated manuscript of about 1649 addressed to the republican army officer and politician Sir Arthur Hesilrige, suggesting the printed text may have been a reworked and substantially enlarged version. These publications were censured in turn by John Spittlehouse, a former member of the army, and a group of six presbyterian booksellers. John Lilburne, however, commended Norwood's <span class="italic">An Additional Discourse</span>, calling it &#145;one of the excellentest pieces that lately I have read in England, for clearing up the ancient fundamental laws, rights, and liberties&#146;, and thought its author a &#145;sober and rational man&#146;  (J. Lilburne, <span class="italic">The Upright Mans Vindication</span>, 1653, 29&#150;30). On 8 June 1654 Norwood was back with Tany, witnessing his claim under the name ThauRam Tanjah to the seven crowns of England, France, Reme, Rome, Naples, Sissiliah, and Jerusalem. It may have been about this time that Norwood became acquainted with Roger Crab (<i>c</i>.1616&#150;1680), a former army agitator who had taken to a hermit's life. Crab subsisted on a vegetarian diet consisting of bread, bran, herbs, roots, dock leaves, mallows, and grass. It was said that Norwood, &#145;enclining&#146; to his &#145;opinion, began to follow the same poore diet till it cost him his life&#146;  (R. Crab, <span class="italic">The English Hermite, or, Wonder of this Age</span>, 1655, &#145;To the reader&#146;). Robert Norwood died at one Mr Manning's house, in Enfield, on 17 September 1654. Administration of his estate was granted to his brother John Norwood on 24 October 1654. His place of burial, however, is unknown.<br>
