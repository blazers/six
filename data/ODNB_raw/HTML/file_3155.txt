<span class="headword">Brabourne,  Theophilus</span>  (1590&#150;1662), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Norwich, the elder of two sons of Henry Brabourne, a hosier with puritan sympathies, who wanted Theophilus to &#145;prove a godly minister&#146;  (Brabourne, <span class="italic">A Reply</span>, 94). He was educated at the Norwich Free School until he was fifteen, and at seventeen, instead of proceeding to Cambridge, he was sent to London as a wholesale agent in the family business. Clergy with puritan leanings were already being silenced for non-compliance, and Henry Brabourne reasoned that it was not an auspicious time for his son to take holy orders. Theophilus remained in London until his marriage, about 1619, to Abigail, daughter of Roger and Joane Galliard of Ashwell Thorpe, a union which was to produce five children. He then returned to Norwich, and with a renewed interest in ministry applied himself to study under the tutelage of &#145;three able divines&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;compensation, perhaps, for a lost undergraduate training. In 1621 he took the MA degree, and in September of that year he was ordained by Thomas Dove, bishop of Peterborough and formerly dean of Norwich, thus becoming one of a very few to have been ordained in the Anglican tradition without having received a formal university education. He was licensed for the Norwich diocese in April 1622, and in 1630 was noted as curate at Catton in Norfolk. Details of his clerical appointments are meagre, and by 1654 he had relinquished active ministry to devote his time to study, writing, and the management of his not inconsiderable properties. He had by then achieved notoriety as a heretic, and had established a reputation as an able writer and controversialist.<br>
<br>Brabourne's claim to recognition rests in his vigorous and sustained sabbatarianism, particularly his <span class="italic">Discourse upon the Sabbath Day</span> (1628), the first work in the English language to advocate observance of Saturday as the sabbath, and its sequel, <span class="italic">A Defence of &hellip; the Sabbath Day</span> (1632). These works were catalysts in the development of seventh day doctrine and practice in early seventeenth-century England, and their influence was to extend well beyond their own day and beyond English shores. Although Cox is incorrect in regarding Brabourne as the founder of the Seventh Day Baptists  (Cox, 1.157&#150;8), it is none the less true that the <span class="italic">Discourse</span> and the <span class="italic">Defence</span>, together with Brabourne's other works on the sabbath, contributed significantly to the adoption of seventh day principles by Baptists and others in the seventeenth century and later. Brabourne, however, remained an Anglican, eschewed believers' baptism, and wishing to avoid schism did not openly observe the seventh day himself, fearing that it would bring confusion &#145;to see a few keep Saturday for Sabbath, and a multitude to keep Sunday&#146;  (T. Brabourne, <span class="italic">A Defence</span>, 1632, 229). Despite this reticence few argued the necessity of seventh day observance more cogently or consistently, or with more adverse effects, than Brabourne. Between 1628 and 1660 he published in all ten works which wholly or in part advocated the Saturday sabbath. Brabourne's theology of the sabbath derived from a threefold conviction: that the moral law as expressed in the ten commandments was perpetually binding; that the practice of Christ and the early church necessitated observance of the seventh day; and that the identity of the seventh day, despite changes in the calendar and arguments to the contrary, remained indisputably Saturday. Later sabbatarian apologists would return to the arguments found in his writings, but it was Brabourne who laid the foundation for a revival in the English-speaking world of an ancient practice that was to continue into the twenty-first century.<br>
<br>The appearance of the <span class="italic">Defence</span> in 1632 had unforeseen consequences. Alexander Gordon believed that its publication was one of the reasons that induced Charles I to reissue the so-called <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> in 1633  (Gordon, 567). For Brabourne himself it marked the beginning of a journey to the court of high commission and Newgate gaol. The <span class="italic">Defence</span> was boldly dedicated to Charles, who referred it to Francis White, bishop of Ely, for a response. White's reply, <span class="italic">A treatise of the sabbath-day &hellip; a defence of the orthodoxal doctrine of the Church of England against sabbatarian novelty</span>, appeared in 1635, too late to prevent the spread of Brabourne's &#145;heresy&#146;, which White himself admitted might already &#145;have poisoned and infected many people with this Sabbatarian error, or some other of like quality&#146;  (White, &#145;Epistle Dedicatory&#146;). It was also too late for Brabourne. By October 1633 he was in prison, and in April and June of 1634 he found himself before the court of high commission charged with holding and disseminating &#145;erroneous, heretical, and judaical opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 126). He admitted authorship of the <span class="italic">Defence</span> and to holding sabbatarian views, &#145;as much bound to keep the Saturday Sabbath as the Jews were before the coming of Christ&#146;  (ibid.), and was pronounced a Jew, a heretic, and a schismatic. It was ordered that he be deprived of all ecclesiastical privileges, deposed from holy orders, excommunicated, fined &pound;1000, and required to make a public retraction of his errors at such time and place and in such form as the court should approve.<br>
<br>Brabourne was remanded in custody pending further consideration of his case and the possibility of handing him over to the secular authority should he persist in his views. One of his prosecutors, Sir Henry Marten, moved during the trial that the old anti-Lollard legislation <span class="italic">De haeretico comburendo</span> be brought against him, and only the personal intervention of William Laud prevented it. Brabourne remained in gaol for the next eighteen months while proceedings continued. Eventually in February 1636 he was released, having finally agreed to a submission acceptable to the court. Although it was received as a recantation, Brabourne later claimed that he had only retracted the word &#145;necessarily&#146; in the statement &#145;Saturday ought necessarily to be our Sabbath&#146;. This had been &#145;rashly maintained&#146;, he agreed, but withdrawal of the word &#145;necessarily&#146; had been but the retraction &#145;of a rash word, not the matter&#146;  (Brabourne, <span class="italic">A Reply</span>, 100&#150;01). It was, it seems, the only element of the original sentence that was finally imposed.<br>
<br>Brabourne returned to Norwich and, after keeping a low profile for some years, resumed publication in the 1650s on a range of topics. His <span class="italic">Of the Changing of Church-Discipline</span> (1653) and <span class="italic">The Second Part of the Change of Church Discipline</span> (1654), which advocated a form of Erastianism against the papal system, and against presbyterians and Independents, attracted the wrath of a local presbyterian, John Collings (or Collins), a bitter opponent of all non-presbyterians. A vitriolic exchange ensued between Collings and Brabourne which quickly degenerated into a mutual attack <i>ad hominem</i>, bringing no credit to either party, and in which Collings taunted Brabourne over his lack of education and aborted ministry, calling him a &#145;Boltpoak, Weaver, Hostler, Maltster, and now a non-sensical scribbler&#146;  (J. Collings, <span class="italic">A New Lesson for the Indoctus Doctor</span>, 1654, title-page). Brabourne, undeterred, continued to advocate observance of Saturday, in opposition to Daniel Cawdrey, joint author with Herbert Palmer of the important <span class="italic">Sabbatum redivivum</span>, and against Jeremiah Ives and Edward Warren, both of whom had also opposed him over the seventh day. He also published on other issues. There are eight known pamphlets from his pen in the 1650s and 1660s, in addition to his works on the sabbath and the exchanges with Collings, in which he defended the authority of the king and parliament, supported the oath of allegiance, advocated liberty of conscience, and attacked the Church of England. In <span class="italic">The Humble Petition of Theophilus Brabourne unto the Honourable Parliament</span> (1661) he returned to the temporal power of the church, arguing that archbishops and bishops should &#145;own the king's supremacy&#146; in fact as well as in theory, claiming that the structure of the Church of England had been taken from the papal system and maintaining that Charles I had &#145;unadvisedly&#146; delegated ecclesiastical power to his bishops  (T. Brabourne, <span class="italic">Humble Petition</span>, 1661, 2, 8&#150;9). In <span class="italic">Sundry Particulars Concerning Bishops</span> (1661) he called for a radical restructuring of the Church of England, including abolition of the office of bishop, on the grounds that Anglican orders were derived from Rome, and that the money could be put to better use.<br>
<br>Brabourne died at Norwich between 28 April 1662, when a codicil was made to his will, and 4 November, when it was proved. He was predeceased by his wife and four of their five children. His estate, consisting largely of property and land, was left mainly to his surviving daughter and her children and to his thirteen other grandchildren, with the exception of a few small bequests and with provisions for outstanding debts to be settled from rental income. He left &pound;10 for &#145;the poor Sabbath-keepers in Norwich, to be distributed by Mr Pooly [Christopher Pooley] and his elders&#146;. Brabourne's wider legacy to posterity, however, remains his writing on the sabbath, the influence of which is still evident today.<br>
