<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Thomas Francis</span>  (1788&#150;1879), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Dalquharran Castle, Ayrshire, on 11 November 1788, was the only son of Thomas Kennedy of Dunure and Dalquharran, and great-nephew of Thomas Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1754), Scottish judge. His mother was Jane, daughter of John Adam of Blair Adam, Kinross-shire, architect. Kennedy was educated first under James Pillans, afterwards professor of humanity at Edinburgh, then at Harrow School, where he was a contemporary of Byron, and subsequently at the University of Edinburgh, where he attended Dugald Stewart's lectures and studied law, but took no degree. He was called to the Scottish bar in 1811, and in 1818 he entered parliament for Ayr burghs, which he continued to represent until his retirement from political life in 1834. A strong whig, he took from the first a prominent position in the House of Commons. In 1819 he introduced, but failed to carry, a measure for the reform of the Scottish poor law, and subsequent attempts met with no better success. He was more successful with a measure for substituting a system of ballot with peremptory challenge on the part of the prisoner for the arbitrary power which the Scottish judges then possessed, and sometimes abused, of nominating juries in criminal cases. His measure was adopted by the government in 1825 and carried into law (6 Geo. IV c. 22). Kennedy also advocated the abolition of the inquisitorial powers vested by the Scottish law in the public prosecutor, and of the Scottish law of entail. He took great interest in the salmon fisheries of Scotland, and was chairman of a committee appointed in 1824 to inquire into the laws relating to them, which initiated the measure passed in 1828 for their preservation (9 Geo. IV c. 39). In 1831 he piloted through the House of Commons the government bill providing for the eventual extinction of the Scottish court of exchequer.<br>
<br>In general politics Kennedy supported the removal of religious disabilities, the extension of the franchise, and the reduction of the corn duties. He was the close friend of Henry Cockburn, Lord Minto, Jeffrey, and other eminent members of the whig party in Scotland, in concert with whom he prepared in 1830 a scheme for the extension of the franchise in that country, and gave notice of motion on the subject in the House of Commons, but withdrew it on the government's announcing their intention of introducing a comprehensive measure of reform. He forwarded to Lord John Russell for ministers' consideration a memorandum, &#145;Proposed reform in Scotland&#146;, which was adopted as the basis of the government's measure. In recognition of his services to the cause of reform, Grey gave him, in February 1832, the post of clerk of the ordnance, and in the following November promoted him to a junior lordship of the Treasury.<br>
<br>Financial embarrassment, due in great measure to Kennedy's voluntary assumption of responsibility for his father's debts, compelled his retirement from political life in 1834. In 1837 he was appointed to the newly created office of paymaster of the civil services in Ireland, and sworn of the Irish privy council. He administered this office with great efficiency until 1850, when he exchanged it for a commissionership of woods and forests. High-handed action against several employees in this department led to complaints to the Treasury. Gladstone, as chancellor, recommended his dismissal and in 1854 Aberdeen dismissed him without a pension, an action which led to a substantial row between Russell and Gladstone. Kennedy's correspondence with Russell on the affair was published as <span class="italic">Letter to &hellip; Russell from the Rt. Hon. T. F. Kennedy &hellip; with Lord John Russell's reply and remarks and correspondence</span> (1854).<br>
<br>For the rest of his life Kennedy resided mainly on his Ayrshire estates, occupying himself with county affairs, stock-breeding, sanitation, and the application of science to agriculture. He did not, however, lose interest in politics; he approved of the reform movement of 1867&#150;8, and of the <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> of 1870. Kennedy was chosen as an extraordinary director of the Highland Agricultural Society in 1835, and was a deputy lieutenant and a justice of the peace for Ayrshire. He married in 1820 Sophia, only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24050/', "Sir Samuel Romilly")</script>; they had one son. Congestion of the lungs led to Kennedy's death at his home, Dalquharran Castle, on 1 April 1879.<br>
