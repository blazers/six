<span class="headword">Kyffin,  Maurice</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1598), <span class="occ">author and soldier</span>, is more than likely to have been the son of Thomas Kyffin and Catrin Llwyd, who are known to have had four children. If so, he may have been born before his parents were married. Both his probable parents belonged to landed families in or near Oswestry, then a largely Welsh-speaking town. Kyffin's coat of arms is depicted as the end-piece of his best-known work, <span class="italic">Deffynniad Ffydd Eglwys Loegr</span>. He was clearly a man of learning, but all that is known about his education is that he studied poetry under the most famous Welsh bard of his age, Wiliam Ll&#375;n, who lived in Oswestry, and that in London, from 1578 to 1580, he was one of the pupils and friends of the polymath John Dee. About 1580 to 1582 he was tutor to Lord Buckhurst's three sons, whom he prepared for entry to Oxford University. He appears to have been on close and friendly terms with a wide circle of scholars and litt&eacute;rateurs, who numbered among them such celebrated figures as John Dee, William Camden, Edmund Spenser, Sir John Harington, William Morgan, Dr David Powel, Gabriel Goodman, Roger Cook, and his own brother, Edward. He wrote a considerable amount of verse in English and Welsh, and many of his Welsh poems are preserved in manuscript form. His most celebrated English poem is <span class="italic">The Blessednes of Brytaine</span>, the first impression of which was printed in 1587 and the second in 1588. Inspired by the dire threat to Elizabeth and her realm from her Catholic enemies at home and abroad, it praised in lavish terms the &#145;inestimable benefits&#146;, especially in religion, conferred upon the kingdom by the queen's &#145;incomparable blessed rule&#146;. It was dedicated to the earl of Essex and recounted the close, but unspecified, connection between its author's father and the earl's father and grandfather. In 1588 Kyffin also published an English prose translation of the comedy <span class="italic">Andria</span>, written by the Latin poet Terence. In the same year he was appointed surveyor of the muster rolls to the English army in the Netherlands and in 1591 deputy treasurer to the English forces in Normandy.<br>
<br>Maurice Kyffin returned to London in 1594 to complete his literary masterpiece, <span class="italic">Deffynniad Ffydd Eglwys Loegr</span>, a translation into Welsh of Bishop John Jewel's <span class="italic">Apologia</span> for the faith of the Church of England, which had originally appeared in 1562. Kyffin's Welsh text, published in 1595, became one of the classics of the language. In spite of its author's having lived much of his adult life outside Wales and his being reluctant to publish in Welsh, believing that he might achieve greater fame by writing in English, his book is remarkable for its smooth and powerful expression. He avoided the pitfalls which often beset translators, for instance of being too dependent on the style and idiom of the original author. Yet his own misgivings were not wholly unjustified; his name was virtually unknown in Wales until 1671, when a second edition of <span class="italic">Deffynniad Ffydd</span> was published. A Welsh poem written by him <i>c</i>.1595 indicated that he spent some time in the Fleet prison. He also directed an English sonnet to Sir Robert Cecil asking for his help in distress and a petition to the queen seeking service in France.<br>
<br>It was not in France, but in Ireland, however, that in 1596 Kyffin found an opening as comptroller of the musters to the army, although the eighteen months or so that he spent there proved to be a very stormy period. In his dispatches to Burghley and others he described the appalling conditions he encountered in Ireland: a country devastated by famine, rebellion, brutal warfare waged by both sides, and especially the exploitation of populace and soldiers as a result of the corrupt practices of commanders and officials. He was particularly downcast by the intrigues and peculation indulged in by his colleague Sir Ralph Lane. Kyffin himself was praised by Burghley and other leading figures for his honesty and conscientiousness. He died on 2 January 1598 and was buried in Christ Church, Dublin, though his grave has since been lost. In his will, drawn up in 1595, he did not mention his parents but only his brother, Edward, to whom he left &pound;130 and most of his books, and two sisters, Elyn Kyffin, or Davies, and Thamesine (later Onslow). The will was emphatically protestant in its opening phrases and provided legacies for the poor of the French church (&pound;3) and the Italian church (&pound;1) in London, and &pound;3 for the poor, especially the parents of maimed and diseased children. His brother was his executor and proved the will on 20 April 1599.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67992"></a><span class="headword">Edward Kyffin</span>  (1557/8&#150;1603), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, is believed to have been &#145;my brother Edward Kyffyn preacher&#146;, who is named in, and proved, the will of Maurice Kyffin. He was born at Oswestry and educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, but does not seem to have graduated. He was ordained deacon at London on 14 May 1585, at the age of twenty-seven, and priest at Bangor on 28 September 1590. He was also recorded as a witness at an ordination in Bangor on 26 September 1593. He was curate of St Martin Outwich, London, and it may have been there that he died from the effects of the great plague in 1603. Since his brother, Maurice, refers in the preface to his <span class="italic">Deffynniad Ffydd</span> to the urgent need for a metrical version of the psalms in clear, intelligible Welsh verse, it may have been at his instigation that Edward undertook his translation. He was the author of <span class="italic">Rhann o Psalmae Dafydd Prophwyd Iw canu ar &ocirc;l y d&ocirc;n arferedig yn Eglwys Loegr</span> (&#145;Part of the psalms of the prophet David to be sung according to the tune customary in the Church of England&#146;), which was printed by Simon Stafford for T[homas] S[alisbury] in 1603. In a letter to Sir John Wynn of Gwydir, Thomas Salisbury claims that Kyffin had composed about fifty metrical psalms before falling victim to the plague. However, the printed version, of which only one copy is known to be extant and which may never have been published, contains only the first twelve psalms and the first five verses of the thirteenth. They are set in simple free stanzas, known in Welsh as <i>awdl gywydd</i>, side by side with the biblical text. In the dedicatory epistle to his fellow countrymen, Kyffin explained that his reasons for undertaking the translation were that he believed Welsh to be one of the oldest languages in creation and that it had been preserved by God's providence down the centuries with some particular object in mind&#151;presumably to bring the Reformation to the Welsh in their own tongue.<br>
