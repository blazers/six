<span class="headword">Coward, Sir  Henry</span>  (1849&#150;1944), <span class="occ">chorus master</span>, was born at Liverpool on 26 November 1849, the only son of Henry Coward, a Sheffield-born cutler who became an innkeeper and black-face minstrel, and his wife, Harriet Carr, who was also a singer. A hard youth as a cutler's apprentice in Sheffield was followed from 1870 by seventeen years of schoolteaching, of which sixteen were spent as headmaster of various elementary schools, a considerable achievement given that he was self-educated and at the age of twenty-one could hardly write or spell. Coward developed an interest in music after joining a tonic sol-fa class; in 1876 he founded the Sheffield Tonic Sol-fa Association, later named the Sheffield Musical Union, and directed it for nearly sixty years (1876&#150;1933).<br>
<br>In 1887 Coward left teaching and devoted himself to music. He obtained at Oxford the degrees of BMus in 1889 and DMus in 1894. From 1896 to 1908 he was chorus master of the Sheffield music festival, which quickly achieved worldwide fame by setting up and maintaining a new standard of choral excellence. In 1906 and 1910 he took a Yorkshire chorus to Germany. In 1908 he was training and conducting choral societies in Sheffield, Leeds, Huddersfield, Newcastle, and Glasgow. In that year he and his singers toured Canada and in 1911 they made a round-the-world tour of the empire. These years were the zenith of Coward's career, and he was much requested as an adjudicator at various music festivals and as teacher, lecturer, and examiner. He was a music master at the Sheffield Training College and lecturer in music at Sheffield University. In later years his effects were criticized as mere tricks, and unfortunately the scope of his musicianship was always limited by his inability to handle an orchestra. A valuable exposition of his methods is given in his <span class="italic">Choral Technique and Interpretation</span> (1914) and its supplement <span class="italic">&#145;CTI&#146;, the Secret</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Coward was somewhat formidable at a first encounter, but those who came to know him learned to admire his humanity and integrity. He was knighted in 1926, and was made an honorary freeman of the city of Sheffield and of the Cutlers' Company of Hallamshire. In 1933 he received the honorary degree of DMus from the University of Sheffield. He was a lifelong advocate of the tonic sol-fa system of sight-singing and was president of the Tonic Sol-fa College in London (1929&#150;43).<br>
<br>Coward was married three times: first, in 1875, to Mary Eliza, daughter of Charles Best, a silversmith of Sheffield; secondly, in 1894, abroad, to Louisa Hannah Best, the sister of his first wife, who had died; and thirdly, after the death of his second wife, in 1911, to Semima Alice, the daughter of Simeon Dewsnap, a cabinet-case manufacturer of Sheffield. There were four sons and four daughters of the first marriage. Coward died, a wealthy man, at his home, 6 Kenwood Road, Sheffield, at the age of ninety-four, on 10 June 1944.<br>
