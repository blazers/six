<span class="headword">Nesbitt,  Colebrooke</span>  (1755/6&#150;1798), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was one of two natural sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53420/', "Arnold Nesbitt (bap. 1721, d. 1779)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53421/', "Nesbitt family")</script>], a prominent merchant and banker in the City of London and MP for Winchelsea in Sussex and Cricklade in Wiltshire, and Martha Yeates (<i>fl</i>. 1756&#150;1798). From 7 June 1773, when he became an ensign in the 32nd regiment of foot, in which he was gazetted lieutenant on 25 October 1775, his career followed the usual advancement by purchase. He became a captain in the 82nd on 5 January 1778 and a major in the 19th on 3 May 1782. He transferred to the 52nd on 9 May 1789 and was gazetted lieutenant-colonel on 21 June 1789, brevet colonel on 26 February 1795, local major-general on 3 May 1796, an aide-de-camp to George III, also in 1796, and major-general on 8 January 1798.<br>
<br>Nesbitt is presumed to have served in Ireland with the 32nd, in North America with the 82nd, and in the West Indies with the 19th. With the 52nd he took part in the Third Anglo-Mysore War of 1790 against Tipu Sultan. On 21 December 1791 he led the successful assault on the hill fort of Savanadrug without loss to the British. That victory helped prepare the way for Lord Cornwallis's final and successful attack on Tipu's stronghold at Seringapatam, which began on 6 February 1792. During the preliminary stages Nesbitt's insistence on adhering to clearly erroneous orders for an assault on the mosque redoubt, although achieving the establishment of the right-hand division before Tipu's camp outside Seringapatam, resulted in heavy British casualties.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1795 Nesbitt was appointed inspector-general of all the foreign corps raised for the crown after the outbreak of war with France in 1793. His brief was to muster all the corps already serving or about to be engaged to serve as part of the British army on the continent, and his correspondence and reports show that he carried out his tasks energetically and efficiently. He was based in Hanover, chiefly at Stade on the River Elbe, throughout 1795 and in the autumn of 1796. Early in 1796 he established a London office in John Street, near Berkeley Square, though he was sometimes at Southampton to oversee the embarkation and disembarkation of troops.<br>
<br>On 26 or 27 May 1797 the duke of York sent Nesbitt, as &#145;an officer whose discretion and prudence could be thoroughly depended upon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 2.582), to take command at Gravesend during the naval mutiny at the Nore. The same qualities may have occasioned his appointment in January 1798 as commander of an expeditionary force to Haiti.<br>
<br>The moiety of an estate in Grenada which Arnold Nesbitt devised to him in tail male in 1779 may have been his chief source of income. He had married Elizabeth Sneyd (1766/7&#150;1835), the daughter of his father's friend Jeremy Sneyd, at St George's, Hanover Square, on 7 November 1789. They had one son, Douglas, and two daughters, Mary Elizabeth Emma and Caroline. From 1798 the Nesbitts had a leasehold house in St James's Place, Piccadilly. They also had a house at Crookham, and often stayed with Jeremy Sneyd at Testwood House.<br>
<br>Nesbitt's only known liaison was with Christiana Skellhorn, who, as Christiana Nesbitt, was living with their daughter Carolina at Brunswick in Germany in 1798. His closest friends were Major-General Sir James Craig, Colonel John Moore (both of whom received bequests in his will), Major-General George Don, and Robert Ballard Long, for whom he negotiated the succession to the lieutenant-colonelcy of Ferdinand Hompesch's mounted riflemen in February 1798. Accompanied by Long, Nesbitt embarked at Portsmouth on 6 February 1798 as commander of an expeditionary force to Haiti, but while becalmed at Cowes fell ill with &#145;a violent bowel complaint&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/150, fol. 153), possibly caused by an intestinal obstruction. After putting in at Funchal, Madeira, for treatment, he eventually returned to London, where he died, at his home in St James's Place, on 21 July 1798. He was buried in the south vault of St James's, Piccadilly, on 25 July.<br>
