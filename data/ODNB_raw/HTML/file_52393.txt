<span class="headword">Staveley,  May Christophera</span>  (1863&#150;1934), <span class="occ">university teacher</span>, was born at Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, on 14 May 1863. She was the fourth daughter of Eastland Staveley, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Ann, who educated her largely at home, though she may have attended a school in London. She entered Somerville College, Oxford, in 1895 at the age of thirty-two. She obtained a second class in honours modern history in 1898 and the Dublin MA available to women not yet granted degrees at Oxford. Later Bristol awarded her an honorary MA. From Somerville she went to Birmingham to become the first warden of its women's university settlement. In 1905 she became head of the women's hall of residence, at Liverpool University, and lecturer in history there. In 1907 she moved to Bristol University as lecturer in history and tutor to women students.<br>
<br>At Somerville she had been an older contemporary of Eleanor Rathbone; some were disappointed that in Liverpool she held aloof from the political campaign for women's suffrage. Nor did she, as a Quaker, play an active part in specifically Quaker movements. (As a member of Somerset education committee she eventually became a governor of Sidcot, a Quaker school.) She became known, however, as a courageous and strenuous worker for women's causes. Women had been admitted to University College, Bristol, from its opening in 1876. May Staveley was determined to encourage women from outside the city to enter. She got together a committee including members of the Fry and Wills families, and when Clifton Hill House came on the market in 1909 took what its historian calls &#145;the almost reckless initiative&#146; of persuading her committee to buy it. Fifteen students came into residence in September 1909, before the house had been paid for or its equipment fully provided. During the two years before the university took it over, Clifton Hill House was run independently. The warden's salary was paid out of profits and would not exceed &pound;100.<br>
<br>May Staveley's venture succeeded. Anonymous donors made it financially secure. By the time the university took over there was constant pressure for more accommodation. Clifton Hill House itself had been built in 1750 in the Palladian style. More recently it had been the greatly loved home of John Addington Symonds, who believed both house and garden had &#145;a special grace&#146;. May Staveley remained its warden for the rest of her life, combining her duties with her lectureship and her office as tutor of all the women students of the university. She became president of the Bristol branch of the Federation of University Women. It is said that she actively supported sixteen causes, including animal welfare. It is also said that she spent much of the night answering letters from former students.<br>
<br>May Staveley's wardenship lasted from the Edwardian period through the First World War to the depression of the 1930s. In a long period of immense social change legends accumulated: of her disapproval of smoking, of her devotion to Pekingese dogs, of her supposed opposition to the plan to open a men's hostel near Clifton Hill House. She may have been less permissive than other wardens in the Somerville tradition, but increasing numbers of women students came to Bristol. Residents of Clifton Hill House recalled the grace and kindness of the warden, and the beauty of their surroundings. There was a general impression of unsophisticated fun. May Staveley died there, after a long illness, but still in office, on 20 December 1934. The vice-chancellor asked for the funeral to be on Saturday so that members of the university could attend. There was a large gathering at the simple ceremony at the Quaker burial-ground at Kingsweston.<br>
