<span class="headword">Corrie,  George Elwes</span>  (1793&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was born at Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, on 28 April 1793, youngest of eight children of John Corrie (1746&#150;1829), the curate there, and his first wife, Anne McNab (1751&#150;1798). One of his three brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6351/', "Daniel Corrie")</script>, became bishop of Madras. The family was Scottish but a tradition claiming descent from Cluny Macpherson is decidedly improbable. Corrie was educated at home, followed country pursuits, and entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1813. Upon graduating in 1817 he was elected to a fellowship and soon after, at what was for the time a young age, was made tutor of his college. He held that post until 1849, with growing distinction because his old-fashioned churchmanship in unsettled times, studied courtesy, and concern for the spiritual development of the young, gave an attractive tone to the society and greatly increased its numbers. He took a BD degree in 1831 (DD 1853), and filled most college offices, often holding several at the same time.<br>
<br>Corrie had a huge appetite for business and for ecclesiastical and theological scholarship, and in the years between 1845 and 1858 edited Latimer's <span class="italic">Sermons and Remains</span> and <span class="italic">The Homilies</span>, Nowell's <span class="italic">Catechism</span>, Twysden's <span class="italic">Historical Vindication</span>, Burnet's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, and Wheatly's <span class="italic">Common Prayer</span>. Other works included a timely <span class="italic">Historical notices of the interference of the crown with the affairs of the English universities</span> (1839), and a biography (with his surviving brother, Henry) of Bishop Corrie. The anonymous <span class="italic">On Endowments of the Parish Churches in England</span> (n.d. [<i>c</i>.1835]) is attributed to him. He also wrote for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society of which he was a founder and four times president, and was for many years president of the Cambridge Architectural Society. As Norrisian professor of divinity (1838&#150;54) Corrie, a little under middle height, silver-haired, and with a patrician mien, was a strong influence on the Cambridge educated clergy. He was expected to succeed to the mastership of St Catharine's in 1845, but his pupil, Henry Philpott was elected. It was a grievous and unmerited disappointment to him. In 1849, however, his friend Bishop Turton of Ely (to whom he was chaplain) presented him to the mastership of Jesus College, Cambridge, and later added the rectory of Newton near Wisbech. He remained as active as before in college and comfortable in his parish, for at heart he was a country priest. Corrie theological prizes were established at St Catharine's and Jesus.<br>
<br>Corrie prided himself on consistent conservatism and spent much time and energy going against the tide of affairs in church and university. He opposed Catholic emancipation and the admission of dissenters to degrees, and cordially disliked both ritualists and radicals. As master of Jesus (and in 1850 as vice-chancellor), he refused to co-operate with parliamentary commissioners, and snubbed the chancellor, Prince Albert. He lived to see fellows married when he believed their duty lay in celibacy: he remained a bachelor. The last ditch was his spiritual home, and Adam Sedgwick, Prince Albert's local secretary, described him as &#145;obstinate as a mule &hellip; he, perhaps, never believes himself to be in the wrong&#146;  (Winstanley, 234). Yet he had a dry, sometimes self-conscious humour as in his letter to a railway company to say that proposals to bring &#145;foreigners and others&#146; to Cambridge on Sundays were &#145;as distasteful to the authorities of the University, as they must be offensive to Almighty God and to all right-minded Christians&#146;  (Holroyd, 271&#150;2). And when the 1877 commissioners asked about the main wants of the university he replied that the first was &#145;exemption from the disturbing power of Royal or Parliamentary Commissions&#146;. Too frail to take much part in public affairs, he nevertheless retained his mental faculties until he died &#145;of natural decay&#146; at Jesus lodge on 20 September 1885; he was buried at Newton. His large library was sold by Sothebys.<br>
