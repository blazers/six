<span class="headword">Hurlestone,  Randall</span>  (1525/6&#150;1587?), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was one of seven children of Richard Hurlston of Picton, Cheshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of James Shawcrosse of Manchester. The records of Hurlestone's education, and indeed of his entire career, are obscured by some uncertainty, to no small degree because of the many variant spellings of his name. Both Venn and Sterry claim that he is the Ralph Hurleton who attended Eton College between approximately 1539 and 1543, and who was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, on 12 August 1543, aged seventeen, and left without a degree, despite having been made a fellow, in 1546&#150;7.<br>
<br>About 1550 Hurlestone published <span class="italic">Newes from Rome concerning the blasphemous sacrifice of the papisticall masse with dyvers other treatises very godlye and profitable</span>, a pamphlet containing four dialogues which he claimed to have translated. The first dialogue, writes Hurlestone:<blockquote>teacheth playnly that the papisticall Masse is no sacrifice, but rather a blasphemie of Christes passion invented by man. The next techeth how God must be worshypped aryght. The third how sayntes ought to be worshypped. The last what is Christian lybertie.</blockquote>The introductory matter also attacks popish practices. In a preface to Thomas Howard, Hurlestone berates the &#145;beggerly ceremonies fetched out of the bottome of hell&#146;. He writes that he has published the pamphlet, so that &#145;your hole posteritie may knowe what religion your lordshyp followed: forsakynge throughly the Romisshe ydoll, with al his toyes and invencions contrary to gods holy worde&#146;. In a subsequent letter to the reader, Hurlestone calls for Christian teaching to be grounded in the reading of the scripture; he also attacks Catholic teaching, ceremony, and icons, in particular the assumption that the Catholic mass is &#145;a ful sacrifice <i>ex opere operato</i>&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1551 Hurlestone appears to have been in the employment of Lord Dacre: his name is appended to an order for certain items of clothing for Lord Dacre  (BL, Add. MS 5751A, fol. 55). One Ranulph or Randulph Hurleston, who is said to come from Picton and who may very well be the same as the Randall Hurlestone above, was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1553. He was called to the bench in 1569, and made reader in 1572 and treasurer in 1582. He appears frequently in the Inner Temple records until 1587, when he appears to have died. He had no children, but his nephew, John Hurlestone, also applied for admission to the Inner Temple.<br>
