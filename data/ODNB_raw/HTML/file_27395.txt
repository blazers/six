<span class="headword">Throsby,  John</span>  (1740&#150;1803), <span class="occ">antiquary and artist</span>, was born in the parish of St Martin's, Leicester, on 21 December 1740, the eldest son of Nicholas Throsby (<i>bap</i>. 1700, <i>d</i>. 1782), a tailor and alderman of Leicester who was the younger son of Robert and Ann Throsby of Anstey, Leicestershire. His mother was his father's second wife, Martha Mason (<i>bap</i>. 1701, <i>d</i>. 1797), daughter of Anthony Mason of St Nicholas's, Leicester. He was baptized at St Martin's, Leicester, on 13 January 1741 and remained in Leicester all his life, for a large part resident in the High Street.<br>
<br>Educated at the free grammar school, Throsby was apprenticed as a woolcomber on 29 September 1754 and admitted as a freeman of Leicester on 29 September 1760, during his father's mayoralty. He was married by licence at St Martin's, Leicester, on 29 October 1761 to Ann Godfrey (<i>bap</i>. 1743, <i>d</i>. 1813), daughter of Richard and Ann Godfrey of that parish. They had seventeen children, although at least six of these died in infancy. The struggle to maintain such a large family was to be a constant preoccupation. When on 24 September 1770 he was appointed parish clerk of St Martin's, a post he was to hold until his death, Throsby was first able to indulge his taste for writing.<br>
<br>Throsby's first work, <span class="italic">The Memoirs of the Town and County of Leicester</span>, appeared in six volumes between 1777 and 1778, and contained a historical account from pre-Roman times onwards, drawn from previous antiquarian writings and his own research. In 1789 he raised sufficient subscriptions to commence issuing in twelve parts <span class="italic">Select views in Leicestershire from original drawings containing the seats of the nobility and gentry, town views and ruins</span>, in which he published his own drawings with an accompanying historical account and description. One part of the series appeared every two months but delays in printing the plates meant that the last part was not issued until 1792. His supplementary volume, entitled <span class="italic">A Series of Excursions in the Year 1790 to the Villages and Places of Note in the County</span>, also appeared in 1792.<br>
<br>There followed, again in parts, Throsby's <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Ancient Town of Leicester</span>, which he intended to be completed in 1791, as the title-page suggests, but which was actually finished in 1793. A portrait of the author aged fifty appeared as a frontispiece. Also between 1790 and 1797 he worked upon a new edition of Robert Thoroton's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Nottinghamshire</span> (1677). The portion dealing with Nottingham, containing also &#145;all that is valuable in Deering&#146;, appeared first in 1795. In 1797 this volume was reprinted as part of a three-volume series entitled <span class="italic">Thoroton's History of Nottinghamshire Republished with Large Additions</span>, illustrated again with Throsby's drawings.<br>
<br>As a collector and antiquarian, Throsby followed with interest the unearthing of archaeological remains. In 1793 he published an open letter to the president of the Society of Antiquaries entitled <span class="italic">Letter to the earl of Leicester on the recent discovery of the Roman cloaca or sewer at Leicester with some thoughts on the jewry wall</span>. Reporting in detail on the discovery of Roman remains, he urged a closer investigation. Among other pamphlets, in 1795 he published <span class="italic">Thoughts on the provincial corps raised and now raising in support of the British constitution at this awful period, by a private in the Leicestershire regiment</span>, drawing on his own experience of service with the Loyal Leicestershire volunteer cavalry.<br>
<br>In later life Throsby suffered a lingering illness and impoverished circumstances, and was supported by the efforts of friends who raised money by subscription. He died on 5 February 1803 and was buried on 8 February at St Martin's, where a tablet in his memory was erected over the old vestry door.<br>
<br>A man of humility and integrity, Throsby enjoyed great respect locally, although he suffered from the prejudice of other scholars owing to his relative poverty and lack of education. John Nichols incorporated much of his work in his own history of the county, particularly relating to Leicester, and purchased the copperplates for Throsby's Leicester volume after his death. Although he recalled Throsby as &#145;a man of natural genius&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities</span>, 1.602), Nichols, in emphasizing the difficulties suffered by Throsby in later life, effectively belittled his achievements. Throsby deserves fuller credit both for his own research and for his drawings.<br>
