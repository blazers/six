<span class="headword">MacDougall,  Alexander</span>, lord of Argyll  (<em>d.</em> 1310), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, succeeded his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49384/', "Ewen MacDougall (d. in or after 1268)")</script>, as head of his kindred. Himself the son of a king&#151;for Ewen had been king in the Hebrides under the crown of Norway&#151;he served two kings of Scots, Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1249&#150;86) and John (John de Balliol, <i>r</i>. 1292&#150;6), and two kings of England, Edward I (<i>r</i>. 1272&#150;1307) and Edward II (<i>r</i>. 1307&#150;27), and bitterly opposed a third king of Scots, Robert I (<i>r</i>. 1306&#150;1329). For a time he seemed set to recreate the hegemony of his ancestor Somerled (<i>d</i>. 1164), king of the Hebrides and <i>regulus</i> of Argyll and Kintyre; but he died in old age, in exile, in English service.<br>
<br>In 1275 MacDougall was one of the leaders of a Scottish expedition sent to subdue the Isle of Man. In 1284 he was among the Scottish magnates who took the oath acknowledging Margaret, the Maid of Norway, as heir-presumptive to the crown. Subsequently Alexander supported John de Balliol in the competition for the throne of Scotland and acted as one of his auditors. MacDougall's wife was a Comyn of Badenoch, and this, together with the fact that his dynastic rivals, the MacDonalds, supported the Bruce claimant, helps to explain his support for Balliol, who as king conferred important administrative powers on MacDougall as part of a policy of extending royal authority in western Scotland. But private quarrels continued, and in 1299 Alexander MacDougall killed Alexander MacDonald, chief of his kindred, who may have been his son-in-law&#151;&#145;the person who was best for hospitality and excellence that was in Ireland and Scotland&#146;, according to the Ulster annals  (Hennessy and MacCarthy, 2.393). Some years previously the MacDougalls had accounted for Cailin Mor Campbell, head of another prominent west highland family.<br>
<br>After the deposition of John, king of Scots, in 1296, MacDougall at first opposed Edward I. Later, however, he and his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54284/', "John MacDougall")</script> of Argyll, became committed supporters of the English king, and in 1305 Alexander was appointed to Edward I's council for Scotland. The slaughter of John Comyn of Badenoch in 1306 intensified the MacDougalls' opposition to Robert Bruce, who was inaugurated king of Scots in that year. In 1307 and 1308 King Robert broke Comyn and MacDougall power. After the fall of his mainland castle of Dunstaffnage in 1308, Alexander MacDougall (although not his son John) came briefly into the king's peace, and attended his parliament at St Andrews in 1309. Shortly afterwards, however, he fled to England, where both Alexander and John attended a council held by Edward II at Westminster in June 1310. Alexander MacDougall died at the end of 1310, perhaps in Ireland, where he and John had been directed in English service.<br>
<br>From Alexander MacDougall and his son John descend the later chiefs of clan MacDougall to the present day, some accounts to the contrary notwithstanding. A daughter, Christian, married Maolmuire Lamont, and another married Lachlan MacRuari.<br>
