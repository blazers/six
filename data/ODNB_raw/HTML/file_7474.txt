<span class="headword">Dendy,  Walter Cooper</span>  (1794&#150;1871), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at or near Horsham in Sussex. After an apprenticeship in that area he moved to London about 1811 and entered himself as a student at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1814 and commenced practice in Stamford Street, Blackfriars; soon after he moved to 6 Great Eastcheap. He was made a fellow of the Medical Society of London, of which he became president.<br>
<br>Dendy was noted for his cultivated taste and polished manners; he was also an excellent speaker. He held some unusual religious views but he was considered too much of an enthusiast to be a materialist. He was the author of many books, including <span class="italic">On the Phenomenon of Dreams</span> (1832), <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Mystery</span> (1841), and <span class="italic">Psyche: a Discourse on the Birth and Pilgrimage of Thought</span> (1853). His other writings included works on medical and geographical topics. Dendy was a skilled draughtsman and illustrated his own works. He also contributed to medical journals and published a number of papers in the <span class="italic">Psychological Journal</span>. For many years he acted as senior surgeon to the Royal Infirmary for Children, in the Waterloo Road. On 2 April 1867 he was nominated a fellow of the Anthropological Society of London; on 3 November 1868 he read a paper &#145;Anthropogenesis&#146; before the society, which contained a trenchant attack on Darwinian theories.<br>
<br>Dendy was somewhat retiring by nature and, with the exception of the annual dinner of the Medical Society and the biennial festival of the students of Guy's Hospital, he seldom appeared at the profession's social events. Having retired from practice he spent much of his time in the reading-room of the British Museum, where his eccentric costume made him a well-known character. After a short illness he died at his home, 25 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, London, on 10 December 1871.<br>
