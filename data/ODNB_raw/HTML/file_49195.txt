<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Musson, Dame  Ellen Mary</span>  (1867&#150;1960), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 11 August 1867 at The Castle, Clitheroe, Lancashire, one of the twelve children of William Edward Musson (1831&#150;1917), surgeon, and his wife, Susanna Catherine Robinson (1839&#150;1911). Musson received a good education at home (1870&#150;85), travelled in France and Germany, and worked as a governess before deciding at the age of twenty-seven to become a nurse. She undertook a three-year training (1895&#150;8) at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where she was the gold medallist in her final year. The matron at that time was Isla Stewart, a leading personality in nursing politics and education, and Musson spent eight years working with her as night superintendent, sister, and assistant matron. In 1906 she moved to Swansea to become the matron of the Swansea General and Eye Hospital, and two years later was appointed matron of the General Hospital, Birmingham.<br>
<br>As a matron of a large provincial hospital from 1909 until 1923, Musson was very aware of the needs of the emerging profession of nursing, and she worked to improve the nurses' working conditions and salaries. She also understood the need for proper professional education for nurses and developed the training syllabus, post-certificate courses in radiography, and the treatment of venereal disease, and established an important school of massage. Before leaving Birmingham she fulfilled one of her dreams, to open a club for nurses and professional women, with the financial support of Mrs Cadbury, the lady mayoress of Birmingham, and the local branch of the College of Nursing.<br>
<br>Musson joined the Territorial Force Nursing Service when it was established in 1908, and at the start of the First World War was appointed a principal matron. She was responsible for recruiting a large number of nurses for service at home and overseas, as well as for the supervision of the nursing in the 1st Southern General Hospital, based at Birmingham. This hospital started the war with 520 beds and finished it with over 6000. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross, first class, for her services.<br>
<br>Musson shared the view of the leaders of the campaign for the state registration of nurses, believing that nurses required professional independence. She took an active part in the various societies campaigning for state registration, and was a member of the influential League of St Bartholomew's Nurses and president of the General Hospital Birmingham Nurses' League. In 1916 she became one of the first supporters of the College of Nursing, despite the opposition of the leaders of the state registration campaign: she believed that the college offered a chance for unity within the profession. Her decision was a turning point for the party of moderation in the battle for control of the nursing profession, and through her influence and active support she contributed to the college's success. She was involved with the college for the rest of her life, as a member of the council until 1939, as honorary treasurer from 1938 to 1950, and as vice-president from 1950 to 1960. One of her main concerns was the poor economic position of nurses and she worked hard to improve this: one of her finest achievements was the establishment of the federated superannuation scheme for nurses in 1928.<br>
<br>Apart from her work for the College of Nursing, Musson had a distinguished career with the General Nursing Council for England and Wales (GNC). In 1923, when she was elected to this new statutory body responsible for registration under the 1919 <span class="roman">Nurses' Act</span>, she retired from full-time work in Birmingham and moved to Pevensey Bay, Sussex. In 1926 she became the first elected chairman of the GNC; she held this position until she stood down in 1943. As the first nurse chairman of the GNC she had a difficult task: not only was the profession divided ideologically but it was also at odds with the Ministry of Health. The government was more concerned with recruitment levels and the cost of running the hospitals than with raising the standard of nurses' professional education and status.<br>
<br>In the inter-war years the biggest concern for the profession was the shortage of nurses and the large number of untrained &#145;assistant nurses&#146; who made up the shortfall. In 1937 Musson was one of the four nurses to be appointed to the interdepartmental committee on nursing services, chaired by the earl of Athlone. This government committee made many recommendations concerning the conditions, discipline, and social life of nurses, but its report was overshadowed by the start of the Second World War. The recommendations were taken up by the Royal College of Nursing, which appointed a special committee in 1941 to consider how they could be implemented. Musson was also a member of this committee, chaired by Lord Horder, which published several influential reports concerning the assistant nurse, recruitment, education and training, and the social and economic conditions of nurses. After the war, when the National Health Service was being organized, many of the ideas of the Athlone and Horder committees became the foundation of future policy, including the recognition of the assistant nurse.<br>
<br>In 1925 Musson attended the first post-war congress of the International Council of Nurses (ICN), held in Helsinki, as a representative of the College of Nursing, which had been invited by the president of the Finnish Nurses' Association to send an observer. (The college was not affiliated to the national association in Britain, the National Council of Nurses, because of the opposition of Mrs Bedford Fenwick, the founder of the latter and of the ICN.) Musson was very surprised to find herself elected honorary treasurer of the ICN at the meeting. This manoeuvre on the part of the organizers of the ICN illustrates Musson's status as a bridge between the two parties in British nursing. She was a very successful and popular treasurer of the ICN, and was persuaded to remain in office until 1947, when, at the age of eighty, she insisted on retiring. She contributed to the work of the ICN in many fields, including in 1934 the establishment of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation to provide funds for postgraduate study for nurses, as a memorial to Miss Nightingale. On Musson's retirement she was granted honorary membership of the ICN, and at the age of eighty-two she was persuaded to attend its fiftieth anniversary congress, held in Stockholm, when she was made an honorary member of the Swedish Nurses' Association.<br>
<br>Musson's many tributes included appointment as CBE (1928) and DBE (1939), an honorary LLD degree from the University of Leeds (1932), and the international Florence Nightingale medal (1939), and she held many distinguished offices, including the presidency of the National Council of Nurses of Great Britain and Ireland (1945). She devoted her life to the profession of nursing, and to everything she did she brought a first-class brain and integrity. Despite the very real divisions within the nursing profession in Britain, she was accepted by all parties as fair. She was good-looking, with a kind face, and described her hobbies as motoring and travelling. She spent the last fourteen years of her long life, which stretched from the days of Florence Nightingale's nursing reforms to those of the National Health Service, with her brother and sister at their home in Eastbourne. Musson died at the age of ninety-three on 7 November 1960, at her home, Badlesmere, 10 Trinity Trees, Eastbourne, and was cremated in the town on 11 November.<br>
