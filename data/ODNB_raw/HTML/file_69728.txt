<span class="headword">Swalwell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1539), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and archivist</span>, became a monk of Durham Cathedral priory about 1483. In 1486 he is recorded as a scholar at Durham College, Oxford, where he qualified as a doctor in theology in 1503. His notes for lectures on Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span> survive in the margins of one of the many early printed books that he owned and annotated in his distinctive handwriting. Some of these annotations were directed towards preaching and teaching, and they reveal Swalwell's very wide range of reading, from the Fathers through to contemporaries, and a conservative interest in such matters of current debate as the eucharist and papal authority, together with a great concern for decorum in the conduct of the liturgy. He provided many manuscripts in the community's collections with detailed lists of contents, so facilitating their use, and he catalogued the books at Durham's cell at Finchale.<br>
<br>Swalwell was entrusted with important offices in the monastery, as guest-master and chief land agent for ten years (1504&#150;14), and then as almoner for over twenty, with responsibility for four hospitals and a school. It was perhaps the period between 1496 and 1500 when he was monastic chancellor that first stimulated his abiding concern for the monastic archives, where he broke new ground in important ways. He gathered up and arranged the series of annual accounts, presented by some twenty-five different monastic office-holders over a period of more than two centuries, and he devised a subject classification for a substantial proportion of the more miscellaneous material. These activities probably made a decisive contribution to the survival of very important sections of Durham Cathedral's muniments, which now form one of the most significant medieval archives in Britain. Swalwell died, probably in Durham, in the second half of 1539, shortly before the monastery where he had spent most of his long life was dissolved on the last day of the year.<br>
