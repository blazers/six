<span class="headword">Barclay,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1632), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born in Aberdeen of unknown parents. He was sent to Bordeaux in the 1580s to study the Latin and Greek humanities and philosophy at the municipal Coll&egrave;ge de Guyenne. This was one of the leading schools in France and had strong Scottish connections. George Buchanan had taught there earlier in the century, and one of Barclay's professors was the later principal, Robert Balfour. On leaving the college, Barclay probably studied law at the University of Bordeaux before gaining employment in the early 1590s as professor of rhetoric at the Toulouse Coll&egrave;ge de l'Esquille, another municipal humanist powerhouse. He taught there for three or four years under the principal, Simon Tubeuf, then, in the middle of the decade, returned to the Coll&egrave;ge de Guyenne as professor of philosophy. This time, though, he stayed no more than a year or two before being recalled to the Coll&egrave;ge de l'Esquille in 1596 as principal on Tubeuf's death. Barclay presided there for twelve years and proved an effective administrator, persuading the municipality to double its annual subsidy and building up its boarding facilities by getting the councillors to outlaw private lodgings in the city with more than six pupils. He himself taught philosophy, and he had two other Scots on his teaching staff: his brother, Patrick, a Catholic priest, and Thomas Dempster. Barclay resigned as principal in 1608 and at some date in the next few years took up a chair of law at the University of Poitiers, where he lectured on Justinian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>. In 1614&#150;15 he represented the University of Poitiers at the royal court, but almost immediately gave up his professorship to move to a chair in the more prestigious law faculty at Toulouse. He held this position until his death at Toulouse in 1632, serving as the university's rector in 1621.<br>
<br>Barclay was married, possibly in 1600 when he paid a flying visit to Scotland, and had three children: Fran&ccedil;oise (who became the wife of a financial official), Jean-Antoine, and Thomas (whose careers are unknown). He owned an expensive town house in Toulouse, purchased in November 1608, and a farm in the neighbouring countryside. Nothing is known about his abilities as a professor, but he must have been highly thought of by contemporaries to hold the posts he did. Toulouse was so keen to engage his services as a law professor that he was apparently appointed without having to demonstrate his learning alongside other candidates in a series of disputations, as was the custom. Barclay left no printed works, but a transcription of his course on the <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, given at Toulouse in 1619, survives (Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, Toulouse, MS 429). He should not be confused with William Barclay (1546&#150;1608), a contemporary Scottish law professor on the continent.<br>
