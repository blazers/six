<span class="headword">Ludlow <span class="st"> [Ludlowe]</span>,  Edmund</span>  (1616/17&#150;1692), <span class="occ">army officer and regicide</span>, was born in Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire, the son of Sir Henry Ludlow (1592?&#150;1643) of Maiden Bradley and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of Richard Phelips of Montacute, Somerset.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Ludlow (who used the spelling Ludlowe) matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 10 September 1634, aged seventeen. He graduated BA on 14 November 1636, and in 1638 was admitted to the Inner Temple. Sir Henry Ludlow represented Wiltshire in the Long Parliament, and was one of the most extreme critics of the crown. On 7 May 1642 he was rebuked by the speaker for saying that the king was not worthy to be king of England. Edmund Ludlow, moved by his father's persuasion, enlisted at the beginning of the civil war among the hundred gentlemen who formed the bodyguard of the earl of Essex. He was present at the skirmish at Worcester (23 September 1642), where the guard ran away, and at Edgehill (23 October 1642), where it distinguished itself in a more honourable manner. At the close of the first campaign he returned to his native county and became captain of a troop of horse for Sir Edward Hungerford's regiment (10 April 1643). When Hungerford took Wardour Castle, Wiltshire (8 May 1643), he appointed Ludlow its governor. Ludlow made himself famous by the tenacity with which he endured a three months' siege. His answer to the summons sent him by Sir Francis Dodington was published by the newspapers of both parties&#151;by <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span> to show his obstinacy, by <span class="italic">Mercurius Britannicus</span> to show his fidelity.<br>
<br>After a short imprisonment at Oxford, Ludlow was exchanged early in the summer of 1644 and became major of Sir Arthur Hesilrige's regiment of horse in the army under Sir William Waller (10 May 1644). On 30 July 1644, however, Waller gave him a colonel's commission and sent him into Wiltshire to raise a regiment of horse. Parliament about the same time made Ludlow sheriff of his native county, and for the rest of the war he was engaged in endeavouring to reduce it to obedience. He took part, however, in the second battle of Newbury (27 October 1644), in the siege of Basing House (November 1644), and in an expedition for the relief of Taunton (December 1644). At the beginning of January 1645 his regiment was surprised by Sir Marmaduke Langdale at Salisbury, and Ludlow himself escaped with great difficulty. On the formation of the New Model the committee for the selection of officers, ardently backed by Sir Arthur Hesilrige, recommended Ludlow for the command of a regiment, but the Wiltshire committee professed that they could not spare him. Ludlow was elected as member for Wiltshire on 12 May 1646. To him the parliamentary cause was God's cause, to be understood in providentialist and apocalyptic terms. He believed in the almost total separation of church and state. He was a Baptist and worked closely with other Baptists. In theology he was a firm Calvinist predestinarian. His religious intensity did not impede his co-operation with men of other priorities. In parliament he allied with Henry Marten and the most radical critics of the monarchy. He sympathized with the Levellers and was trusted by them.<br>
<br>As a parliamentary speaker Ludlow did not distinguish himself, and his later political importance was due to his influence outside the Commons rather than within it. He took the part of the army in their quarrel with parliament in the summer of 1647, and signed the engagement of 4 August. But the negotiations of the army leaders with the king, and their suppression of the army Levellers, roused his suspicions. He opposed the vote of thanks given to Cromwell for his conduct at the Ware rendezvous, and was still further alienated from him by his avowed preference for monarchy. Nevertheless in the summer of 1648, when Major Huntington accused Cromwell, Ludlow wrote to encourage the latter and to promise him support. Convinced of the danger of a treaty with the king he urged Ireton and Fairfax to put an end to the proposed negotiation by force, and was one of the chief promoters of Pride's Purge in December 1648. He was appointed one of the king's judges, was present at eleven meetings of the court, and his name is the fortieth in the list of those who signed the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Charles's execution was to Ludlow a righteous use of the sword, demanded by biblical injunction, to punish tyranny and bloodguilt.<h2>
<a name="Theinterregnum"></a>The interregnum</h2>On 7 February 1649 Ludlow was ordered to draw up instructions for the proposed council of state. He was himself elected a member of that body on 14 February, and was also a member of the second council elected in February 1650. He married, about 1649, Elizabeth (1629/30&#150;1702), daughter of William Thomas of Wenvoe, Glamorgan, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Sir John Stradling of St Donatus in the same county.<br>
<br>When Cromwell returned from Ireland in June 1650 he thought it necessary to appoint a second in command to Ireton who would replace him in case of death or illness. For this post he selected Ludlow, to whom he privately vindicated his former conduct, and professed his desire to effect that reformation of the clergy and the law on which Ludlow had set his heart. Ludlow hesitated to accept, pleading the condition of his estate, but was nominated by the council of state on 27 June and approved by parliament on 2 July following. He received a commission from Cromwell as lieutenant-general of the horse in Ireland, and from parliament as one of the commissioners for the civil government of that country. In the latter capacity he was paid a salary of &pound;1000 a year. Ludlow, however, complained that during the four years he served in Ireland he expended &pound;4500 out of his own estate over and above his pay. He landed in Ireland in January 1651, passed the Shannon with Ireton in June, and took part in the siege of Limerick. On the death of Ireton (26 November 1651) the commissioners of the parliament issued a circular letter ordering the army to give obedience to Ludlow, but on 9 July 1652 parliament voted Fleetwood commander-in-chief.<br>
<br>Fleetwood did not land until October 1652, so that Ludlow held the chief command for nearly a year. Galway, the only important place in the possession of the Irish at Ireton's death, surrendered in April 1652, and the rest of the war consisted of skirmishes and capitulations. Ludlow narrated at length the hardships of campaigning in Ireland, and the severe measures which he used to force the Irish to submit. The royalist lord deputy, the earl of Clanricarde, proposed to Ludlow (March 1652) a treaty for the settlement of the country, which the latter refused, saying that the settlement of the nation belonged to the English parliament. On 22 June 1652 Ludlow concluded an agreement with Lord Muskerry for the surrender of his forces, and on 28 June the earl of Clanricarde also capitulated. Ireland was practically conquered before Fleetwood landed.<br>
<br>In the settlement of Ireland the confiscated estate of Walter Cheevers of Monkstown, near Dublin, was granted to Ludlow as satisfaction for his pay. Of the policy of the transplantation, and of the principles on which the settlement was based, he thoroughly approved, and he took part in the preliminary measures. The news that Cromwell had expelled the Long Parliament (20 April 1653) did not prevent Ludlow continuing to act both in his civil and military capacity. He broke with Cromwell in December, when Barebone's Parliament was dissolved and Cromwell became protector. Detestation of that &#145;usurpation&#146;, which Ludlow regarded as a fatal sacrifice of God's cause to the &#145;lust&#146; of Cromwell's &#145;carnal&#146; ambition, would stay with Ludlow all his days. On hearing of the coup he rallied opposition among the Baptists in Ireland. He obstructed for several weeks the proclamation of Cromwell as protector, and refused to sign it himself (30 January 1654). After it took place he refused to act further as civil commissioner, lest he should seem to acknowledge Cromwell's authority as lawful, but he resolved to keep his commission as lieutenant-general until it should be forced from him. Cromwell's son Henry, who had been sent to Ireland to assess the state of feeling among the officers, attributed Ludlow's stance to the fact that the military office was the more profitable. After failing to convince Ludlow of the lawfulness of the government, Henry recommended his removal. But the protector was reluctant to proceed to extremities, and Ludlow was allowed to continue in his anomalous position until January 1655, when it was found that he was circulating pamphlets hostile to the government. Fleetwood then demanded the surrender of his commission. To avoid this Ludlow engaged to appear before Cromwell within a couple of months in order to answer the charge, and meantime to act nothing against his government (30 January 1655). But Cromwell's council preferred to keep Ludlow in Ireland, and forbade him to come to England. On receiving a second and still more definite engagement (29 August), Fleetwood gave him leave to go, but the Irish council was against it and had him arrested as soon as he landed in England (October 1655).<br>
<br>After remaining six weeks a prisoner at Beaumaris, Ludlow was allowed to proceed. He had an interview with Cromwell at Whitehall on 12 December 1655. Throughout he persistently refused to engage not to act against the government. He asserted that the present government was unlawful and, while denying that he was privy to any plot against it, refused to pledge loyalty lest providence should lead him into opposition. On 1 August 1656 Ludlow was again summoned before the council and ordered to give security to the amount of &pound;5000 for his peaceable behaviour. Though threatened with imprisonment for his refusal to give security he was allowed to retire with his relations to Essex, where he spent the rest of the summer. His whereabouts in the remainder of Cromwell's lifetime are uncertain. The government was anxious to keep him out of his own county for fear he should obstruct the election of its partisans to the ensuing parliament. Both in 1654 and in 1656 a numerous party in Wiltshire wished to elect Ludlow as one of their members, but in each case the opposition of the presbyterian clergy and the influence of the government prevented it. After Cromwell's death, however, Ludlow was returned to the parliament of January 1659 to represent Hindon. At first he would not take his seat, as he objected to the oath by which members were required to oblige themselves not to act or contrive anything against the protector. Then he slipped in quietly, and, though attention was called to the fact that he had not taken the oath, was allowed to continue sitting.<br>
<br>Before the parliament met, Ludlow and the other leaders of the opposition had arranged their plan of campaign. He spoke often, though apparently not at length. He opposed the bill for the recognition of Richard Cromwell as protector, and sought to set limits to the protector's power over the military forces. &#145;I honour his highness&#146;, he declared, &#145;as much as any man that sits here. I would have things settled for his honour and safety, but if we take the people's liberties from them, they will scratch them back again&#146;. He denied also the right of the members for Ireland and Scotland to sit in the house, and attacked the new upper house with special vehemence. &#145;The men who sat there&#146;, he protested, &#145;had been guilty of all the breaches upon the liberty of the people&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 3.145, 282; 4.173). Before and after the dissolution of the parliament he negotiated with the army leaders for the overthrow of Richard Cromwell and the recall of the Long Parliament.<br>
<br>The recall of the Long Parliament (7 May 1659) and the re-establishment of the Commonwealth made Ludlow a man of great importance. The parliament at once appointed him a member of the committee of safety (7 May), one of the council of state (14 May), and one of the seven commissioners for the nomination of the officers of the army (4 June). He obtained the command of a regiment in the English army (9 June), but was next month chosen commander-in-chief of the Irish army with the rank of lieutenant-general and the command of a regiment of horse and another of foot (4 July). At the end of July he landed in Ireland. There he reorganized the army, changed many of the officers, and put in their places men of his own principles. He also dispatched a brigade to England to aid in the suppression of Sir George Booth's rising. When his work was finished he appointed Colonel John Jones to command in his absence, and returned to England.<br>
<br>Ludlow landed at Beaumaris in October 1659 and was met by the news that Lambert and the army had again expelled the Long Parliament. After hastening to London he used all his efforts to reconcile the army and the parliament, and in conferences with the leaders of the two parties strove to moderate their animosities and make them sensible of the danger of their quarrels to the republic. The army endeavoured to win him by appointing him one of their committee of safety (26 October) and one of the committee for the consideration of the form of government (1 November). He refused to act with them, but complied so far that his parliamentary friends suspected him. He opposed the calling of a new parliament which the army announced, and objected to their scheme for the establishment of a select senate. His own plan was to summon a representative army council and to recall the expelled parliament. The essentials or fundamentals of the republican cause were to be clearly stated and declared inviolable, and twenty-one &#145;conservators of liberty&#146; were to be appointed to watch over them and decide any difference between parliament and army  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.749, 756, 759, 766).<br>
<br>During these discussions Ludlow learned first that Jones and the Irish army had declared for the army, and next that Sir Hardress Waller and other dissentient officers had seized Dublin Castle (13 December), arrested Jones and the other commissioners, and declared for the restoration of the Long Parliament. Accordingly he set out to restore order, and arrived off Dublin on 31 December 1659. Waller and the officers at Dublin not only refused obedience but prepared to arrest him if he landed. A few officers, however, still adhered to Ludlow, and the governor of Duncannon received him into the fort there (5 January). The Dublin officers openly charged him with neglecting his duty in Ireland and in parliament and with encouraging the usurpation of the army, accusations which he indignantly refuted in a correspondence with Waller.<br>
<br>Sir Charles Coote drew up articles of treason against Ludlow and the three commissioners for the civil government of Ireland, which were presented to the now restored parliament on 19 January 1660 by Colonel Bridges. The news of this impeachment met Ludlow on his return to England, and he hastened to demand a hearing. But before he could be heard Monck arrived in London. Both in his speech to the parliament on 6 February and in his letter of 11 February Monck supported Ludlow's accusers. Privately, however, he told Ludlow that he had nothing to object against him but his favour to the sectaries in Ireland, and protested his own faithfulness to the republic. Ludlow nevertheless urged his friends, in vain, to adjourn parliament to the Tower and collect their scattered forces for armed resistance. Nor was he more successful in getting parliament to set a day to justify his own conduct.<br>
<br>The readmission of the secluded members (21 February) put an end to all hope of maintaining the Commonwealth by parliamentary means, and Ludlow plotted a rising of the republican regiments. Obliged to leave London for fear of arrest he succeeded in getting the electors of Hindon to return him to the Convention (4 April 1660), though he dared not appear personally at the election. He was preparing to join Lambert in his abortive insurrection when he received the news of Lambert's recapture. Thereupon he went to London. He took his seat in parliament on 5 May, and distinguished himself at once by refusing to take any part in nominating the commissioners sent to Charles II at Breda. On 14 May the House of Commons ordered that all persons who had sat in judgment on the late king should be forthwith secured, and on the 18th Ludlow's election was voted void. As he lay concealed in a house near Holborn, he saw the crowds returning from welcoming Charles II to London.<h2>
<a name="Exile"></a>Exile</h2>Ludlow did not long remain in hiding. Though he was not one of the seven regicides capitally excepted by the Commons from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>, he was included among the fifty-two persons excepted for penalties less than death. At the request of the Commons the king issued a proclamation (6 June) summoning all the judges of Charles I to surrender on pain of entire exemption from pardon. Relying on the implied promise contained in this proclamation Ludlow surrendered himself to the speaker on 20 June, hoping to escape with a fine and to gain time to settle his estate. The speaker committed him to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, who allowed him his liberty, accepting sureties for his appearance when wanted. Ludlow provided four men of straw, and waited to see what the king and the lords would do. Before long he discovered that his life was in imminent danger, and at the end of August 1660 made his way to Lewes, and escaped to Dieppe.<br>
<br>The government, ignorant of Ludlow's movements, thought he was still in England and offered a reward of &pound;300 for his arrest (1 September 1660). Twice during the autumn his capture was actually announced. In October 1661 he was said to be lurking in Cripplegate. Spies reported that 40,000 old soldiers were pledged to rise in arms, and sectaries asserted that a few days would see Ludlow the greatest man in England. In reality, although Ludlow remained closely in touch with the nonconformists in England, he advised them against precipitate action, warning them that &#145;the Lord's tyme is not yet come&#146;  (Ludlow, <span class="italic">Voyce</span>, 1978, 11). No rumour about him was too absurd to find credit. In July 1662 he was to head a rising in the west of England. In November he had been seen at Canterbury, disguised as a sailor, and soldiers scoured Kent and Sussex to find him. It was believed that Ludlow had bound himself by an oath never to make his peace with the king, to refuse pardon and favour if they were offered to him, and to wage perpetual war with all tyrants.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Ludlow quietly travelled through France and established himself at Geneva. On arrival he learned of the executions of ten of his fellow regicides in England. He interpreted that measure, and the executions of four more roundheads in 1662, as barbarous acts of revenge which were certain to provoke divine vengeance. Not finding himself sufficiently assured of safety in Geneva, he moved in April 1662 to Lausanne, and in the following autumn to Vevey. On 16 April 1662 the government of Bern granted to Ludlow and his fellow fugitives, Lisle and Cawley, an act of protection by which they were permitted to reside in any of the territories of that canton. Ludlow paid a personal visit to Bern to thank the magistrates, who received him with great kindness and honour.<br>
<br>As soon as the English court discovered that Ludlow had found refuge at Vevey plots against his life began. Irishmen, Savoyards, and Frenchmen were successively engaged in these designs. John Lisle was assassinated at Lausanne on 11 August 1664, but the vigilance of the authorities of Vevey and his own caution frustrated all attempts against Ludlow.<br>
<br>The war between England and the Netherlands (1664&#150;7) seemed to many of the exiled republicans an opportunity for re-establishing by Dutch aid the English republic. Ludlow was urged to come to the Netherlands, and was promised high command in the Dutch service and armed support in this enterprise. D'Estrades, the French ambassador there, sent him a passport to guarantee his safe passage through France. Ludlow resisted these offers. He distrusted the sincerity of the Dutch. He also regarded their decision to hand over to the English government, in 1661, three fugitive regicides, John Barkstead, Miles Corbet, and John Okey, who were executed the following year, as an act of treachery and bloodguilt, of which the Dutch must repent before God's servants could join with them. His friends were disgusted by his caution, and Colonel Blood, who was sent over to persuade Ludlow to head a rising in England, described him as very unsuited to such an employment.<br>
<br>In exile Ludlow watched with great keenness the course of events in England. For more security he adopted a variant of his mother's name, and signed the letters Edmund Phillips. His wife had joined him in 1663, and remained with him for the rest of his exile. One by one he lost the companionship of his fellow regicides. Cawley died in 1666, Nicholas Love in 1682, and Andrew Broughton in 1687. In April 1684 some of the exiled whigs endeavoured to persuade Ludlow to head a rising in the west of England. Their agent found him &#145;no ways disposed to the thing, saying he had done his work, he thought, in the world, and was resolved to leave it to others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Confession of Nathaniel Wade</span>, BL, Harley MS 6845, fol. 269). The revolution of 1688 seemed to open to him the prospect of a return to England. The preface to the first edition of his memoirs states that he was sent for as a fit person to be employed in the reconquest of Ireland. On 25 July 1689 he took a solemn farewell of the magistrates of Vevey, telling them that the Lord had called him home to strengthen the hands of the English Gideon. He went to London, where his house became the rendezvous of the survivors of the godly and republican party. On 6 November 1689 Sir Joseph Tredenham called the attention of the House of Commons to his presence in England, and they resolved to ask the king to issue a proclamation for apprehending Ludlow, who still stood attainted of high treason. An address to this purpose was presented to the king by Sir Edward Seymour on 7 November. William III answered that the desire of the Commons was reasonable and just, and published a proclamation offering &pound;200 reward for Ludlow's arrest. Ludlow escaped to the Netherlands, according to tories with the connivance of the king, and returned in safety to Switzerland. His death, probably in Vevey, is mentioned in Narcissus Luttrell's diary under 26 November 1692.<br>
<br>Ludlow was buried in St Martin's Church, Vevey, and the monument erected there by his widow in 1693 states that he died in the seventy-third year of his age. The epitaph is printed in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">Travels through Italy and Swisserland</span>  (1745, 264) and in the preface to the 1751 edition of Ludlow's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. Over the door of his house at Vevey Ludlow placed a board with the inscription &#145;Omne solum forti patria quia patris&#146;, a Christianized version of a line of Ovid (&#145;to the brave man every land is a fatherland because God his father made it&#146;). The authorities of Vevey set up during the nineteenth century an inscription marking the site of the house in which Ludlow lived. But in one view the inscription is wrongly placed, and should be on the house at 49 rue du Lac.<br>
<br>Ludlow left no children. His widow married, in 1694, Sir John Thomas, bt, and died on 8 February 1702, aged seventy-two. The best portrait of Ludlow is that prefixed to the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. According to a note by Thomas Holles in the copy of the 1751 edition which he gave to the public library at Bern, it is &#145;a bad print from a very good drawing on vellum by R. White, taken from the life when the general was in England in the reign of King William&#146;  (A. Stern, <span class="italic">Briefe Englischer Fl&uuml;chtlinge in der Schweiz</span>, 1874, xi).<h2>
<a name="Ludlowsmemoirs"></a>Ludlow's memoirs</h2>In exile Ludlow composed a huge autobiographical work, &#145;A voyce from the watch tower&#146;. By the later 1660s his narrative had reached recent times, and thereafter the story, which he took up to 1685, was a record of more or less contemporary events. After Ludlow's death his manuscript came into the hands of Slingsby Bethel, who had earlier visited him in Switzerland. Although most of it is lost a substantial portion of it, covering the years 1660&#150;77, was recovered in 1970 and is in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. A heavily rewritten and heavily abbreviated version of &#145;A voyce&#146; appeared as the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span> in 1698&#150;9 in three volumes, nominally published at Vevey but in reality printed by John Darby of Bartholomew Close, London. The editor was probably the deist and republican John Toland. The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> belonged to a cluster of late seventeenth-century publications printed by Darby which included the <span class="italic">Discourses</span> of Algernon Sidney and the works of John Milton and James Harrington. They took advantage of the standing army controversy that followed the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 to promote the cause of the radical and country whigs. Ludlow's puritanism was eliminated, and his views overhauled so as to make him a republican of secular outlook and country party sympathies. Although most of the autobiographical material in the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> has a basis in Ludlow's own words, his style is transformed and there are passages of pure invention. Some doubts were expressed at the time, and again at various moments in the eighteenth century, about the authenticity of the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> but until the 1970s they were generally accepted as authentic.<br>
<br>Ludlow was a prominent figure of the puritan revolution, but it is the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> that have constituted his principal claim on posterity's attention. They have generally been at their most influential at those points where his manuscript was most extensively revised, but Ludlow's editor treated his facts less unfaithfully than his character and views, and the work, which supplies vivid accounts of Ludlow's military and political career, can still be profitably consulted. Ludlow and the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> were admired by eighteenth-century Commonwealthsmen and radical whigs, though by the nineteenth century judgements of both the man and the work had become more critical. There were editions in 1720&#150;22, 1751, and 1771, but that by C. H. Firth (2 vols., Oxford, 1894) supersedes earlier versions. It has extensive supplementary material. The portion of &#145;A voyce from the watch tower&#146; that covers the years 1660&#150;62 was published in the <span class="roman">Camden</span> series of the Royal Historical Society in 1978.<br>
<br>In 1691&#150;3 four pamphlets were published, ostensibly at Amsterdam, in Ludlow's name, but really by another person or persons. Attacking the tyranny of Charles I and praising the Long Parliament they, like the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> after them, were contributions to the radical whig cause. Comtemporaries variously attributed them to Slingsby Bethel, John Phillips (Milton's nephew), Thomas Percival, and John Toland. An ode to Ludlow is in Thomas Manley's <span class="italic">Veni, vidi, vici</span>, 1652.<br>
