<span class="headword">Ashburnham,  William</span>  (1604/5&#150;1679), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the second son of Sir John Ashburnham (1570/71&#150;1620) of Asburnham, Sussex, and Elizabeth (1577&#150;1651), daughter of Sir Thomas Beaumont. His family were long settled in east Sussex and had first represented the county of Sussex in parliament in 1397. However, the family fortunes were in disarray following Sir John's injudicious dependence on the fluctuating profits of wealden iron. Ashburnham's was an unenviable position, though never so bleak as the subsequent comment that he was &#145;not born to a farthing&#146; might suggest  (Henning, 1.554). He was able to call upon the position of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/738/', "John Ashburnham")</script>, in the household of the first duke of Buckingham and became a soldier, seeing service for the states general in the Low Countries in 1625 and then acting on the Scottish border in 1639 and 1640. He also secured appointment to the bench in Bedfordshire and Hampshire from 1636 and was a deputy lieutenant in the latter county by 1640.<br>
<br>About 1627 Ashburnham made a promising marriage to Jane (<i>d</i>. 1672), widow of James Ley, first earl of Marlborough, and daughter of John, first Baron Boteler of Brantfield. The marriage, though childless, was, according to his monument at Ashburnham church, a felicitous one:<blockquote>William coming from beyond sea, where he was bred a soldier, married her, and lived after five-and-fortie yeares most happily with her.</blockquote>The memorial goes on to bring Ashburnham's brother, John, into the picture and to emphasize their family <i>esprit</i>:<blockquote>William lived after her to a great age and gloried in nothing in this world but in this his wife, and the almost love and entire friendship that for about fiftie yeares was between his deare elder brother, John Ashburnham, and himself.<br>
<br>He died without issue, and, by God's blessing, was a happy preserver of his brother's posterity.</blockquote>Through his marriage Ashburnham gained land on the Wiltshire&#150;Hampshire border and its influence probably accounts for his return to the Short and Long parliaments of 1640 as member for the nearby borough of Ludgershall. He was a natural and probably fiery royalist and took part in the army plot of 1641. His expulsion from the Commons followed on 9 December. Charles I made him cofferer of the household in 1642, but soldiering preoccupied him. Lieutenant-colonel of foot in 1639, he became colonel in the first civil war, was a major-general for the 1643 campaign, and governor of Weymouth (which he held against the parliamentary forces) in 1644. He and his wife suffered from the financial exactions of the triumphant parliamentarians: the estate which Jane had brought him at Tidworth in Wiltshire was lost. In 1654 he and his elder brother were arrested for sending money over to the exiled Charles II, and, perhaps, for complicity in the Gerard plot of that year.<br>
<br>The family fortunes, William's among them, had been at a low ebb before and during the civil wars, but were rapidly revived in 1660. Both Ashburnhams, indeed, seem to have been more concerned to profit where they could than to look back in anger at the 1640s and 1650s. Charles II reinstated William to his old office of cofferer of the household. He became a JP for Middlesex and Westminster and an assessment commissioner there. He also served as one of the commissioners for loyal and indigent officers in the capital in 1662. Ashburnham also, symbolically, threw in his lot with the burgeoning companies of the Restoration era. He was a member of the Society of Mineral and Battery Works and of the Society of Mines Royal from 1662 (and deputy governor of the former from 1664 and of the latter from 1675, both to his death). He was an assistant of the Royal Adventurers into Africa in, and at times after, 1664. He was in the Royal Africa Company by 1672 and the Royal Fisheries by 1677. Samuel Pepys knew him well and summed him up as &#145;an old experienced man and a Courtier&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 7.407). Ashburnham's metropolitan contacts and his reputation as a man in favour at court no doubt facilitated his access to money-making schemes. He was a substantial investor in the Duke of York's Theatre in Dorset Gardens. But it must have been his position of cofferer that provided the most substantial and sustained opportunities for building up his resources and his property: he was said to have &#145;got by the Court &pound;50,000&#146;. William and John between them had an eye open for investment opportunities (including, in 1671, the Mortlake tapestry factory) and systematically nursed the family fortunes back to health, doing much to improve the family's main estate at Ashburnham. Ashburnham Place and the church were rebuilt and William built almshouses. Such co-operation between brothers was unusual. In John's will of 1670 he bequeathed to William Molton Park in Northamptonshire in lieu of &pound;5000: this, together with any other property, was to be sold to make up that debt. By the time of his own death William's property included estates at Ampthill in Bedfordshire and the manor of Mountfield, very close to the ancestral estate at Ashburnham in east Sussex. These went to William's great-nephew, John (Baron as from 1689) Ashburnham.<br>
<br>Despite the loss of his Tidworth estate, and probably reliant on support from the Seymours, Ashburnham had been returned to parliament for Ludgershall in 1661. He sat, and remained active, throughout the Cavalier Parliament. He was known, denounced, and celebrated as a consistent supporter of the court. It was only in 1678 that illness began keeping him from the Commons. He did not stand in 1679 and died, in his seventy-fifth year, on 9 December 1679. He was buried at Ashburnham.<br>
