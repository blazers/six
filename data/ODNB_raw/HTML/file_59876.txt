<span class="headword">Rodocanachi,  Peter Pandia</span>  (1831&#150;1899), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born on 22 September 1831 in Leghorn, Italy, the youngest of five children of Pandia Paul Rodocanachi (1786&#150;1846), merchant, and his wife, Marigo, daughter of Theodore Petrocochino. He was a member of one of the most influential families in the Greek merchant diaspora; and the merchant enterprises run by the Rodocanachis, along with those of the Ralli family, were to be among the most important in the City of London.<br>
<br>Rodocanachi is believed to have come to England about 1850, and very soon afterwards he assumed responsibility for his family's commercial interests in London. His eldest brother, Paul, had returned to Leghorn to head the family firm there on the death of their father in 1846, and his other brother, Theodore, left England permanently in the mid-1850s. On 29 September 1860 Rodocanachi married Jenny Sechiari (1842&#150;1927), the daughter of George Sechiari. They had six children, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1860 Rodocanachi set up the trading firm Peter Pandia Rodocanachi &amp; Co., which had links with Theodore P. Rodocanachi &amp; Co., St Petersburg, and Theodore Mavrogordato &amp; Co., Odessa. The firm graduated into finance and continued to operate in banking until 1970. As a banker Rodocanachi in the 1860s was a director of the short-lived Mercantile and Exchange Bank Ltd, and in 1872 he joined with other prominent London-based Greek merchants, to found the Anglo-Foreign Banking Company, which went into voluntary liquidation in 1893, with its assets being acquired by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Generale de Belgique.<br>
<br>An active member of the Greek Orthodox church in London, Rodocanachi served as a churchwarden in 1864, and in 1873 he was one of seven members of the Greek community who supervised the construction of St Sophia's, the Greek Orthodox cathedral in west London. He retired to Worthing in 1890, where he died at 2 Heene Terrace on 18 December 1899. He was buried at the Greek Orthodox cemetery at West Norwood, London.<br>
<br>His eldest son and fourth child, <a name="cosubject_59877"></a><span class="headword">Pandia Peter Rodocanachi</span>  (1865&#150;1936), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born in London on 3 May 1865. He was educated in Paris, and returned after his studies to join the family banking firm. Although he was considered to be a shrewd businessman and was for a time a director of the Commercial Union Assurance Company, his commitment to commerce was half-hearted. He retired from the family firm in 1911, and thereafter the effective control of the firm passed to members of the Mavrogordato family.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1889 Rodocanachi married Alexandra (<i>b</i>. 1870), the daughter of Paul Schilizzi, and they had three sons and one daughter. Like his father, he was a prominent member of the Greek Orthodox community in England, serving as a churchwarden at St Sophia's Cathedral in 1901. In the same year King George I of Greece conferred on him the order of the Redeemer. In 1902 Rodocanachi purchased an estate, The Toft, Dunchurch, Warwickshire, and increasingly he devoted himself to agricultural and social pursuits. He became an enthusiastic follower of local hunts and a successful breeder of hunters. He was a regular exhibitor at shows in Warwickshire and the surrounding counties. Pandia Peter Rodocanachi died on 27 October 1936 at The Toft, Dunchurch, and was interred in the Greek Orthodox cemetery at West Norwood, London.<br>
