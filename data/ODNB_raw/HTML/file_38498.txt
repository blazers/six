<span class="headword">Broome,  Arthur MacLoughlin <span class="st"> [Arthur Eugenius]</span></span>  (1779&#150;1837), <span class="occ">animal welfare campaigner</span>, was born on 18 February 1779 and baptized in Sidbury, Devon, on 28 August 1785. He was apparently the son of Arthur (or Thomas) and Frances Broom. He entered Balliol College in March 1798 and took his BA degree in 1801. Broome was ordained a deacon in 1802 and a priest the following year by the bishop of London. Between 1812 and 1815 he held the curacy at the Kent parishes of Brook and Hinxhill and, from 1816 to 1818, at Cliffe-at-Hoo. In June 1820 he was appointed vicar of St Mary's-Bromley-St Leonard in Middlesex (later Bromley by Bow), but resigned in 1824, presumably to concentrate on his duties as secretary of the newly formed Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).<br>
<br>It is not known how Broome developed his concern for the treatment of animals. In 1822 he published an edited version of Primatt's 1776 essay <span class="italic">The Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals</span>, in which he claimed he had &#145;always felt peculiarly interested&#146; in the subject for its &#145;moral and religious&#146; implications  (Primatt, x). The many editorial comments in the book reveal Broome's interest in the question of whether animals had souls, his fondness for the beauty of nature, and his fear that the practice of cruelty rendered &#145;human nature proportionably less fit for humanity&#146;  (27). The passing of Richard Martin's act to prevent cruelty to cattle in 1822 encouraged Broome to form a society which would enforce the act and promote &#145;the practice of humanity&#146;  (RSPCA, <span class="italic">Prospectus</span>, 201). In 1823 he stated his intention to donate profits from the sale of the second edition of <span class="italic">The Duty of Mercy</span> to the as yet non-existent &#145;Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&#146;. In addition he hired an inspector in December 1823 to watch Smithfield market and prosecute offenders against Martin's act.<br>
<br>The society met for the first time on 16 June 1824. In attendance were the well-known MPs Thomas Fowell Buxton, William Wilberforce, and Richard Martin. Broome was elected secretary and the group immediately set to work: in the first twelve months its inspectors procured 149 convictions and numerous tracts were distributed. However, the new society met with &#145;prejudice and ridicule&#146; and was frequently criticized for attacking pastimes of the lower classes, such as dog-fighting, while leaving upper-class sports, such as fox-hunting, untouched  (<span class="italic">Courier</span>). In addition, the society's finances were suffering. By January 1826 it owed over &pound;168, mostly to printers, and had borrowed over &pound;110 from committee members (more than &pound;80 from Broome himself). As secretary Broome was legally responsible for the debts and hence was imprisoned at king's bench on 27 April 1826. The length of time he spent in gaol is unknown: his absence was noted at an SPCA meeting on 18 May of that year, but he was present at the following meeting on 26 June. By this time his enthusiasm for the society, if not the cause, seems to have diminished: Lewis Gompertz (1784&#150;1861), who had been appointed secretary temporarily during Broome's absence, took over the post completely in 1828 after Broome failed to attend a number of meetings. The committee paid respects to their &#145;benevolent founder&#146;, and Broome remained on the governing committee until 1832; however, he disappears from society records after that time  (RSPCA, <span class="italic">Minute Book</span>, 56). He published a third edition of <span class="italic">The Duty of Mercy</span> in 1831. His whereabouts between 1832 and 1837 are unknown. He died, probably unmarried, on 16 July 1837 of consumption at 44 Bull Street, Birmingham, and on 21 July was given a pauper's burial there at St Philip's Church (now the Anglican cathedral). There is no mention of his passing in the RSPCA records. The society he founded was granted royal patronage by Queen Victoria in 1840.<br>
