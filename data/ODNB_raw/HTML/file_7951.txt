<span class="headword">Dove,  Patrick Edward</span>  (1815&#150;1873), <span class="occ">political theorist</span>, son of Henry Dove, naval officer, and his wife, Christiana Paterson, was born at Lasswade, near Edinburgh, on 31 July 1815. Thomas Dove, bishop of Peterborough, was an ancestor. His family, originally from Surrey, had been connected for many generations with the navy. They lived in Devon after 1716, when Francis Dove RN was appointed &#145;commissioner of the navy&#146; at Plymouth. Henry Dove had retired from active service in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic wars, and held an appointment at Deal connected with the Cinque Ports.<br>
<br>Dove had a desultory education in England and France, until he had to leave school for heading a rebellion against the headmaster. His father would not allow him to follow his own strong desire for naval service. He was sent in 1830 to learn farming in Scotland. He afterwards spent some time in Paris, in Spain, and finally in London, where he became a close friend of Seymour Haden, who was impressed by his &#145;enormous energy, physical and moral&#146;. In 1841 he took the estate of the Craig, near Ballantrae, Ayrshire, where he lived as a quiet country gentleman. A man of great physical power, he was a first-rate rider, a splendid shot with gun and rifle, an expert fly-fisher, a skilful sailor, and an excellent mechanic. Dove wrote the article on gunmaking for the eighth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He was the agricultural adviser of the neighbouring farmers, and, objecting on principle to the game laws, refused to employ a gamekeeper. In the potato famine of the 1840s he did a great deal to provide work for his starving neighbours.<br>
<br>In 1848 Dove lost most of his fortune by an unlucky investment. In 1849 he married Anne, daughter of George Forrester, an Edinburgh solicitor. He spent the next year at Darmstadt, Germany, pursuing the philosophical studies to which he had long been devoted. The first result was a book published while he was still in Germany, <span class="italic">The Theory of Human Progression, and Natural Probability of a Reign of Justice</span> (1850), the first part of a projected treatise on the &#145;science of politics&#146;. It was praised by Sir William Hamilton and Thomas Carlyle; Charles Sumner had it stereotyped in America, and at Sumner's request Dove wrote an article on slavery called &#145;The elder and younger brother&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Boston Commonwealth</span> (21 September 1853). The main principle of the book is that liberty and equality could be reconciled only if rent income were socialized, either as a surrogate for the nationalization of land or as a complement to it. That principle, arrived at independently by Dove, is familiarly associated with more illustrious writers on the &#145;land question&#146;, especially with Herbert Spencer, at least in the first edition of his <span class="italic">Social Statics</span> (1851), and with Henry George, notably in his <span class="italic">Progress and Poverty</span> (1880). Dove was praised by George at a public meeting in Glasgow  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 19 Dec 1884). However, Dove's theories are closer to Spencer than to George, who saw the socialization of rent as a surrogate for the nationalization of land, not as a complement.<br>
<br>After leaving Germany Dove settled in Edinburgh. He lectured at the philosophical institution in 1853 on &#145;Heroes of the Commonwealth&#146;, in 1854 on &#145;The wild sports of Scotland&#146;, and in 1855 on &#145;The crusades&#146;. He took a special interest in volunteer militias. In April 1853 he was captain of the Midlothian rifle club. For six months in 1854 he edited <span class="italic">The Witness</span> during the illness of his friend Hugh Miller, and in the same year he published the second part of his work on politics, called <span class="italic">Elements of Political Science</span>. It included &#145;An account of Andrew Yarranton, the founder of English political economy&#146; (also published separately). In the <span class="italic">Elements</span>, Dove developed his arguments on the ownership of land and on its taxation. This was a continuation of his theoretical ambition of devising a property system that would secure for individuals entitlements not only to the produce of their labour, but also to those natural resources which were distinctively not the product of (human) labour. The third and concluding part was written, but never published, and the manuscript was lost. In 1855 he published <span class="italic">Romanism, Rationalism, and Protestantism</span>, a defence of orthodox protestantism. In 1856 Dove stood unsuccessfully for the chair of logic and metaphysics at Edinburgh University vacated by the death of Sir William Hamilton, but he impressed his successful rival, Alexander Campbell Fraser, as a man who powerfully combined determined practicality with speculative insight. J. S. Blackie, who knew Dove well, spoke of him in similar terms. In the same year Dove published <span class="italic">The Logic of the Christian Faith</span>. In 1858 he published a small book on <span class="italic">The Revolver</span>, with hints on rifle clubs and on the defence of the country, lamenting the depopulation of the highlands. In 1858 Dove moved to Glasgow, where he edited <span class="italic">The Commonwealth</span> newspaper, and was general editor of the <span class="italic">Imperial Dictionary of Biography</span> for its first twenty issues. He also edited with Professor Macquorn Rankine the <span class="italic">Imperial Journal of the Arts and Sciences</span>, and wrote the article &#145;Government&#146; for the 1860 edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He had now developed a rifled cannon with &#145;ratchet grooves&#146;. It was tested by the eminent shipbuilder J. R. Napier, and shown to have great range and accuracy. The ordnance committee before whom it was brought refused to test it further unless the inventor would pay the expenses, which he could not at the time afford.<br>
<br>In 1859 Dove accepted the command of the newly formed 91st Lanarkshire rifle volunteers, and in 1860 he took part in the first meeting of the National Rifle Association at Wimbledon, and won several prizes. He soon afterwards suffered what appears to have been a stroke, which left him partially paralysed. He went to Natal in May 1862 for a change of climate, but returned in April 1863. He died in Edinburgh on 28 April 1873, leaving a widow, two daughters, and a son.<br>
