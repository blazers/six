<span class="headword">Plunkett,  Edward John Moreton Drax</span>, eighteenth Baron Dunsany  (1878&#150;1957), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 24 July 1878 at 15 Park Square, Regent's Park, London, the son of John William Plunkett, seventeenth Baron Dunsany (1853&#150;1899), MP for South Gloucestershire (1886&#150;92), and his wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (<i>d</i>. 1916), daughter of Colonel Francis Augustus Plunkett Burton, of the Coldstream Guards. The Burtons were distant relatives of the Dunsany family and of Sir Richard Burton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35550/', "Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax")</script> was Plunkett's younger brother. <br>
<br>After a first-rate education at Cheam School, Eton College, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Plunkett entered the Coldstream Guards in 1889 and served as a junior officer in Gibraltar and in the South African War. He succeeded as eighteenth Baron Dunsany on his father's death in 1899 and on 15 September 1904 he married Lady Beatrice Child-Villiers (1880&#150;1970), daughter of the seventh earl of Jersey; they had one son. In 1905 Dunsany published <span class="italic">The Gods of Pegana</span>, the first of his many books of dreamlike stories. Unsuccessful in his bid to become MP for Wiltshire in the parliamentary election of 1906, and encouraged by W. B. Yeats, AE, and others, he took up literature rather than politics. The general public liked the gentleman author better than the critics did. His popular short stories include the thriller &#145;A Night at an Inn&#146; and the shocking &#145;Two Bottles of Relish&#146;. With their &#145;sting in the tail&#146; endings, they were applauded for their plot twists. Most of Dunsany's fiction, however, gets by on his graceful escapism and the fairy-tale qualities found even in his easy, genteel essays on life and literature.<br>
<br>Dunsany's plays were sometimes recycled from his short stories and longer fiction. Though slightly fey, they could be focused, for Dunsany had a firm grasp of the theatrical. <span class="italic">The Glittering Gate</span>, in which two burglars go to heaven and find nothing within but laughter, was performed at the Abbey Theatre in 1909. It was his first contribution to the Irish theatre movement. The Abbey also staged <span class="italic">King Argimenes and the Unknown Warrior</span> in 1911. London premi&egrave;res were given to <span class="italic">The Gods of the Mountain</span> (1911) and <span class="italic">The Golden Doom</span> (1912). <span class="italic">The Gods of the Mountain</span> is perhaps Dunsany's best tragedy. In it a group of beggars impersonate the gods who turn them to stone for their insolence. The populace imagines it is their unbelief that has killed them and they beg forgiveness of the new idols. Some of his plays were also staged by amateur theatres and opened in the provinces: <span class="italic">The Lost Silk Hat</span> premi&egrave;red in Manchester in 1913 and <span class="italic">The Tents of the Arabs</span> in Liverpool in 1914. Dunsany's <span class="italic">Five Plays</span> were collected in 1914.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Dunsany served as captain with the 5th Inniskilling fusiliers in France and was wounded during the Easter rising in 1916. He continued to write and publish: <span class="italic">Fifty-One Tales</span> appeared in 1915 and <span class="italic">Tales of War</span> in 1918. A number of his plays were first staged in the United States, including <span class="italic">A Night at an Inn</span> and <span class="italic">The Queen's Enemies</span> (New York, 1916), <span class="italic">Laughter of the Gods</span> (New York, 1919), and <span class="italic">The Murderers</span> (Indianapolis, 1919). These dramas came from an age in which productions, even with exotic settings and costumes, were relatively inexpensive to mount and tickets were affordable for most audiences. Dunsany warned critics not to dig too deep into his works, which were meant (he said) simply to entertain. Yet those who dig find more intellectual substance than expected lying underneath the grotesque and the fanciful or the sentimental.<br>
<br>Dunsany lived with his wife at Dunstall Priory in Kent, but he wrote about his Irish estates, including a castle in co. Meath, and about the ascendancy's sports of hunting, shooting, and fishing. The land of the little people, leprechauns, fairies, and banshees continually fascinated him. Dunsany thought of himself chiefly as a poet, but his poetry was not much better than his amateur pottery. He published seven volumes of verse as well as a collected edition, and T. S. Eliot (whom he thought inferior to Walter de la Mare) appreciated his technical mastery. Yet Dunsany's verse was more gossamer than good; fame, which Dunsany portrayed in his play <span class="italic">Fame and the Poet</span> (1924) as a cheap Cockney harridan, eluded him on that score.<br>
<br>From his excellent first novel, <span class="italic">The Chronicles of Rodriguez</span> (1922), Dunsany showed more promise in fantastic novels of mauve, if not purple, prose. Set in elfland and the spirit world of Welleran with gods older than human history, these chronicle the strange journeys of his eccentric characters Joseph Jorkens (who claimed to have wedded a mermaid) and Colonel Polders. His hero of the age of Don Quixote looks through magic windows into the past and the future and, thanks to a magician, visits distant planets. Joseph Wood Cotton found all this rosy romance too easy and compared Dunsany to a little old lady who cheats at solitaire.<br>
<br>Dunsany's plays continued to be produced throughout the 1920s, including <span class="italic">If</span> and <span class="italic">Cheezo</span> (1921), <span class="italic">His Sainted Grandmother</span> (1926), <span class="italic">The Jest of Hahalaba</span>, and <span class="italic">Mr Faithful</span> (1927). These imaginative works were easily adapted for broadcast to attentive radio fans. Dunsany described his life in such novels as <span class="italic">The Curse of the Wise Woman</span> (1933) and in autobiographical works in the 1930s: <span class="italic">My Ireland</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Patches of Sunlight</span> (1938). He liked to pose as a prolific amateur, dashing off fantasies with a quill pen, but he was Byron professor of English literature at the University of Athens from 1940 to 1941, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and a member of the Irish (and other) academies. He was also president of the Authors' Society and a recipient of an honorary DLitt from Trinity College, Dublin (1940), and of the Harmsworth literary award. He published two further autobiographical pieces during the Second World War: <span class="italic">While the Sirens Slept</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">The Sirens Wake</span> (1945).<br>
<br>In Dunsany's only science fiction novel, <span class="italic">The Last Revolution</span> (1951), computers grow so intelligent they turn on their masters. What is man to do when his technological creatures attain the ability to think for themselves and to reproduce themselves? Having created fairy worlds all his life, &#145;in <span class="italic">The Last Revolution</span>, Dunsany toys with a dystopia&#146;  (Ashley, 153). His contribution to science fiction, small but significant, has never been properly assessed, nor has his later influence on television and cinema fantasies. While snobbery had something to do with a lord of Ireland becoming a lord of literature, Dunsany nevertheless possessed a vivid imagination and an entrancing if mannered style, and, in his day, he enjoyed a loyal and enchanted public.<br>
<br>While dining with friends at Dunsany Castle, Dunsany had an attack of appendicitis and after an unsuccessful operation died at 97 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin, on 25 October 1957. He was buried at Shoreham, Kent.<br>
