<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Borlase, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1576&#150;1648), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in Cornwall, the eldest son of Edward Borlase of London, mercer, and Suzannah Isham. He matriculated as a pensioner from King's College, Cambridge, about 1591 but did not graduate, being admitted to the Middle Temple on 19 October 1595. Pursuing a military career, he fought with distinction in the Low Countries before the 1608 truce, having been knighted in 1606. Thereafter he was frequently on the continent on various missions. In 1620 he was second in command of the expedition sent to the Palatinate and in 1624&#150;5 was made commander of an English regiment serving in the Low Countries. After returning to England in early 1627 he was a military adviser to the government, residing at Medmenham, Buckinghamshire. He married Alice Ravis (<i>d</i>. in or after 1649), widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23175/', "Thomas Ravis (d. 1609)")</script>, bishop of London. They had three sons, the second being the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2907/', "Edmund Borlase")</script>.<br>
<br>In June 1634 Borlase became master-general of the ordnance in Ireland after buying out the previous incumbent for &pound;3000 with the encouragement of the lord deputy, Thomas Wentworth, who held him in high regard. His brief was to reform the Irish army, half of which would be in Dublin at any one time to exercise twice a week under him. His contacts in the Low Countries were also useful in purchasing arms and munitions there. He became an Irish privy councillor in 1638 and was MP for Enniskillen in 1634&#150;5 and Belturbet in 1640&#150;41. On the death of the lord deputy, Christopher Wandesford, he was made a lord justice of Ireland along with Sir William Parsons on 31 December 1640. The king had originally appointed Lord Dillon but as a close ally of Wentworth he was unacceptable to the English parliament. Borlase's appointment was more satisfactory for although he remained loyal to his fallen patron, testifying on his behalf during his trial in London in the spring of 1641, he was viewed as being more malleable. Although well versed in military matters, Borlase was no statesman and was frequently ill. Hence Parsons, a parliamentarian, was <i>de facto</i> governor until he was replaced by the royalist Sir Henry Tichbourne in April 1643. Borlase remained lord justice with Tichbourne until the earl of Ormond's appointment as lord lieutenant in January 1644.<br>
<br>Borlase appeared in London in the summer of 1645, petitioning parliament for a composition, which was granted on 4 October. From the summer of 1646 he advised parliament on Irish military matters. Towards the end of his life he was in financial difficulties, having borrowed money on his own account for the royal forces during his lord justiceship. He died in London on 15 March 1648 and was buried in the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great. His estate in Ireland had suffered so greatly during the rebellion that his wife was forced to petition parliament in 1649 for the cost of the funeral and for her own support.<br>
