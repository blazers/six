<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Eustace</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1215), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Ely</span>, is likely to have been of Norman or French origin. A student at the schools of Paris, alongside Gerald of Wales, who became a lifelong friend, he seems to have been a &#145;consistent benefactor&#146; to the abbey of St Victor, while Roger of Wendover's description of him as &#145;a man of learning both divine and secular&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, 2.114), as well as Gerald's reference to his skill in law, points to a legal as well as a theological training. He is first recorded in 1177 as a clerk of Robert Foliot, bishop of Hereford, and seems to have remained at Hereford, where he became a canon, until at least 1186. By 1190 he was parson of Withcall, Lincolnshire. It is not known when he entered the king's service, but he must have done so well before 20 April 1194, when he acted as deputy for the chancellor in issuing a royal charter at Winchester. Ecclesiastical preferment followed. By 5 May 1194 Eustace was dean of Salisbury, and in 1196 he became successively dean of Richmond, Yorkshire, and treasurer of York. From 1194 onwards he was constantly in attendance on Richard I in Normandy; referred to as the king's seal-bearer, he also continued to act in the place of the chancellor, William de Longchamp. When Longchamp died, on 31 January 1197, Eustace succeeded him as bishop of Ely, the election taking place at Vaudreuil on 10 August 1197; but the king's needs&#151;Eustace was sent to represent Richard at an assembly summoned for 22 February 1198 to elect a new German emperor&#151;prevented his being consecrated until 8 March following, when Archbishop Hubert Walter performed the ceremony in St Katherine's Chapel, Westminster. Later that year, between 18 and 22 May, Eustace was formally appointed chancellor. In October and November 1198 he acted as a justice at Westminster, the only occasion on which he is recorded as having done so. But he then returned to the king's side, and in January 1199 was sent by Richard to the French king to declare an end to the existing truce.<br>
<br>Following the death of Richard I, Eustace was replaced as chancellor by Hubert Walter on 27 May 1199. But this does not mean that he was out of favour with the new king, whose coronation he attended on the same day, and from whom he obtained a charter confirming Ely in its liberties on 23 August. He accompanied John to Normandy in 1200, was present when William, king of Scots, did homage at Lincoln on 21 November, and in both 1202 and 1204 was sent on unsuccessful embassies to the French king. However, although his attestations of royal charters show that he still came to court with some regularity, his energies were increasingly absorbed by the administration of his diocese, and still more by his frequent employment by Pope Innocent III (<i>r</i>. 1198&#150;1216) as a judge-delegate and as an executor of papal mandates. In 1199&#150;1200 he was first a judge-delegate and then an arbitrator in the bitter dispute between Archbishop Hubert Walter and the monks of Canterbury over the former's plans for a collegiate church at Lambeth. In 1200 and 1201 he devoted much time to promoting the canonization of Gilbert of Sempringham. An arbitrator between Bishop Savaric of Bath and the monks of Glastonbury, in 1203 he was appointed to investigate the miracles of Wulfstan of Worcester. In the latter year, and again in 1206, he was employed as an arbitrator in the quarrel between the monks of Evesham, their abbot, and the bishop of Worcester. Towards the end of his life he became deeply involved in the disputes over the election of Hugh of Northwold to be abbot of Bury St Edmunds. The recipient of at least thirty-five letters from the pope, he also addressed correspondence to Rome, on 19 December 1204 drawing from Innocent the celebrated letter <span class="italic">Pastoralis officii diligentia</span>, which contained rulings on some nineteen points of law, every one of which later passed into the law of the church.<br>
<br>Eustace was also closely involved in the difficulties that faced the English church as a result of King John's refusal to accept the election of Stephen Langton as archbishop of Canterbury. Following Innocent III's consecration of Langton on 17 June 1207 the monks of Canterbury who had elected Langton were expelled from their monastery. The pope appointed Eustace, together with William de Ste M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise, bishop of London, and Mauger, bishop of Worcester, all of them former royal servants, to negotiate with King John. Negotiations dragged on until 23 March 1208, when the bishops issued an interdict on England. The king's reprisals were thorough, and a complete seizure of all clerical property began, followed by piecemeal negotiations for its recovery. But those clergy who fled abroad, who inevitably included the three executors of the interdict, did not recover their possessions until 1213. Eustace continued to be involved in Innocent's efforts to put pressure on John, and made several visits to England in aid of these. But negotiations always broke down, and Eustace was present at Arras when John was excommunicated in November 1209. Late in 1212 Eustace went to Rome with Langton and the bishop of London in order to complain of John's oppression of the English church, a visit claimed by some chroniclers&#151;implausibly&#151;to have led the pope to declare John deposed.<br>
<br>When the crisis was resolved on 15 May 1213, by John's becoming a papal vassal, Eustace returned to England, and was present at Winchester when the king received absolution on 20 July, and at St Paul's, London, when John took an oath of fealty to the pope on 3 October. As part of the settlement John was ordered to pay 100,000 marks to the papal legate, Nicol&ograve; of Tusculum, Archbishop Langton, and Eustace of Ely as an earnest of restitution to the ecclesiastics who had suffered serious losses in the previous seven years. Eustace's own damages were variously estimated at &pound;750 and &pound;1050. Finally, at a great council held in St Paul's, London, presided over by the legate, the interdict was formally lifted by Bishop Eustace on 2 July 1214. As John passed from conflict with the pope to confrontation with the barons, Eustace was one of the bishops wooed by the king, who on 15 January 1215 transferred to him the crown's rights of patronage over Thorney Abbey. He is said to have played a leading part in negotiations between John and the rebels, before he died at Reading on 3 February 1215. He was buried in Ely Cathedral, before St Mary's altar, on the south side of the choir.<br>
<br>When circumstances permitted, Eustace was an active bishop. His statute on the tithing of lambs is one of the earliest acts of English diocesan legislation to survive. He appears to have rebuilt and endowed the church of St Mary in Ely; he gave land in Witcham, Somersham, and March to the convent of Ely; and he assigned the church of Impington to the monastic precentor, in order to provide for books. He is also credited with the construction of the Galilee porch at the west end of his cathedral church (though little of his work now survives), with the endowment of a light at the lady altar, and with a grant of land on the west side of the convent enclosure to make a cellar for the monks. Finally, the Ely chronicle records that he gave a number of vestments, a gold chalice and pyx, silver basins and spoons, a pastoral staff, and a little gold cross containing a fragment of the True Cross. Variously praised for his learning, discretion, and authority, Eustace was clearly widely admired by his contemporaries.<br>
