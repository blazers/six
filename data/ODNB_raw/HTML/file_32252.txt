<span class="headword">Calman,  William Thomas</span>  (1871&#150;1952), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, was born at 94 Nethergate, Dundee, on 29 December 1871, the only son and elder child of Thomas Calman (<i>d</i>. 1877), a music teacher blind from childhood, and his wife, Agnes Beatts Maclean. His father's family had been in the shipping trade and were originally from the Anstruther district of Fife. A timid lad with no aptitude for games, Calman became an ardent amateur microscopist and student of pond life while still at Dundee high school, where his scientific interests were encouraged by Frank Young. At sixteen Calman was apprenticed in the Caledonian Insurance Company but was advised, when his term ended four years later, that his stammer made him unsuitable for the work. Meanwhile he had become an active member of the Dundee Working Men's Field Club and joined the Dundee Naturalists' Society, over which he was to preside in 1944. There he met the young professor of natural history at Dundee, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (whose notice he subsequently contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>), whose timely offer of a job as laboratory assistant was eagerly accepted since it enabled Calman to attend classes at University College, Dundee, without payment of fees. He graduated BSc with distinction in botany, physiology, and zoology in 1895. He also found time to learn several foreign languages and assisted with the classification of a large and varied assortment of animals obtained from all parts of the world for the departmental museum. He became interested chiefly, though by no means exclusively, in the crustaceans and published several scientific papers. One of these, which was soon to become a classic, was read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh just before he graduated. He was next appointed assistant lecturer and demonstrator in the natural history department, a post he held until 1903, obtaining his DSc in 1900. He was an excellent teacher and during Thompson's absences abroad was responsible for all the work of the department. In later years he served as external examiner to many universities.<br>
<br>An invitation in 1901 to write the volume on the Crustacea for <span class="italic">A Treatise on Zoology</span> edited by Ray Lankester marked another turning-point in Calman's career. In 1903 he moved to London to take up a temporary post at the British Museum (Natural History) and the following year he was placed in charge of the Crustacea and Pycnogonida, where he worked on specimens of these groups brought back by the <i>Siboga</i> expedition (1899&#150;1900), the British Antarctic <i>Terra Nova</i> expedition (1910), and the <i>John Murray</i> expedition (1933&#150;4). In addition to his official duties he compiled the Arachnida and Crustacea parts of the <span class="italic">Zoological Record</span> for many years. On 28 March 1906 Calman married Alice Jean, daughter of James Donaldson, timber merchant, of Tayport, Fife. She was one of the first women graduates in medicine of St Andrews and in due course their son and daughter both entered the medical profession.<br>
<br>In 1921, the year in which he was elected FRS, Calman became deputy keeper of the department of zoology at the museum, and in 1927 he succeeded Tate Regan as keeper, a post which he held until his retirement in 1936. As a curator he kept the collections under his care in excellent order, while from 1904 onwards, until administrative duties claimed most of his time, he produced a steady stream of scientific papers of the highest order and became the leading carcinologist of his time. To a remarkably retentive memory was added a gift for winnowing the significant from masses of detail. The <span class="italic">Treatise</span> volume, which specialists regard as his masterpiece, was published in 1909 and remained throughout the century as the best introduction to the subject. Much of interest which was unsuited to a textbook was included in his more popular book, <span class="italic">The Life of Crustacea</span> (1911). In 1919 he published a report on marine boring animals injurious to submerged structures in the museum's economic series, ahead of his report for a committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers.<br>
<br>Calman took a prominent part in scientific activities outside the museum. He was a member of the board of studies of London University and served on the council of the Royal Society from 1933 to 1935. He was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club (1927&#150;9) and of the zoology section at the Bristol meeting of the British Association in 1930. As secretary of the Ray Society (1919&#150;46) he edited its monographs. He was zoological secretary of the Linnean Society (1923&#150;8), president (1934&#150;7), and received its gold medal (1949). He was appointed CB in 1935 and made an honorary LLD of St Andrews and an honorary FRS (Edinburgh) in 1937.<br>
<br>Somewhat below average height, Calman was a rather sedate, modest, kind, and sociable man, with a delightful sense of humour. His early appreciation of English literature gave him an unusual command of words and purity of style which were enhanced by the slight hesitancy of speech which replaced his stammer. He was impatient with inaccuracy in any form and as editor and administrator he set a very high standard. But this was no more than he always demanded of himself and his strictness was tempered by his kindly common sense. If he sometimes treated his younger colleagues with benign ferocity he taught them many things besides zoology.<br>
<br>Three years after his retirement Calman moved to Tayport and during the war years he was a part-time lecturer in zoology at St Andrews and Dundee. A series of lectures delivered to his students, <span class="italic">The Classification of Animals</span>, was published in 1949. Following a serious illness he returned to London and died at Woodcote Grove House, his home at Carshalton, Surrey, on 29 September 1952.<br>
