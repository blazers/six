<span class="headword">Longden, Sir  Henry Errington</span>  (1819&#150;1890), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of Thomas Hayter Longden, was born in January 1819. He was educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was appointed to an ensigncy without purchase in the 10th regiment on 16 September 1836. His subsequent commissions&#151;all the regimental ones in the 10th regiment&#151;were lieutenant (1840), captain (1843), brevet major (1849), major (1850), brevet lieutenant-colonel (1856), lieutenant-colonel (1858), and colonel (1859).<br>
<br>After taking a certificate of proficiency in higher mathematics and military drawing at the senior department, Royal Military College, in May 1842, Longden served with his regiment in India, and was present in the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1845&#150;6, including the battle of Sobraon, and in the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1848&#150;9, including the two sieges of Multan, where he commanded the regiment at the attack on the heights on 27 December 1848, and was acting field engineer at the fall of the city. He was also at the capture of Chiniot and the victory at Gujrat, and was promoted brevet major. He served in the Indian mutiny and in September 1857, before Sir Colin Campbell advanced from Allahabad, he dispatched Longden from Benares with a small field force, to assist the Nepali troops in driving the rebels from the Azamgarh and Jaunpur districts. Longden commanded a party of picked marksmen, covering Brigadier Franks's force in the advance to Lucknow, and was attached to the Gurkhas during the siege and capture of the city; he was mentioned in dispatches. He was with Lord Mark Kerr at the first relief of Azamgarh on 6 April 1858, and was chief of the staff of Brigadier Edward Lugard's force at the second relief of Azamgarh, and the operations in the Jagdispur jungles. Longden afterwards retired on half pay, and was adjutant-general in India in 1866&#150;9. He was promoted major-general in 1872 and lieutenant-general in 1877, and retired with the honorary rank of general in 1880.<br>
<br>Longden was a KCB and CSI, and colonel in succession of the Hampshire regiment and the Lincolnshire regiment (late 10th regiment). He died in Bournemouth on 29 January 1890, from a chill caught at the funeral of his old friend Lord Napier of Magdala.<br>
