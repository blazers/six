<span class="headword">Mearns,  Andrew</span>  (1837&#150;1925), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and author</span>, son of John Mearns and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hyslop, was born on 4 July 1837 in Burnside, New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and educated at the Glasgow normal school and Glasgow University. After an early career as a pupil teacher at the Glasgow normal school and an assistant master, first at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then at a school in Maidenhead, Mearns entered the Theological Hall of the United Presbyterian church in Edinburgh in 1860. On completing his training there in 1863, he accepted the co-pastorate of the Congregational church in Great Marlow. From 1866 to 1879 he served as pastor of the new Congregational church in Markham Square, Chelsea.<br>
<br>In 1876 Mearns was elected secretary of the London Congregational Union, Congregationalism's overseeing and co-ordinating body for the capital, and three years later he gave up active ministry (although in 1884 he served as pastor of the Bishopsgate church) to become the union's full-time &#145;secretary without pastoral care&#146;, a post he held for over a quarter of a century. It was in that capacity that he initiated an inquiry into the physical and moral condition of the London slums that resulted in the reform tract <span class="italic">The Bitter Cry of Outcast London. An Inquiry into the Condition of the Abject Poor</span> (October 1883), a twenty-page penny pamphlet that has been called &#145;perhaps the most influential single piece of writing about the poor that England has ever seen&#146;  (Gilbert, 67). The pamphlet, with its dramatic emphasis upon the physical and moral consequences of overcrowding (including incest), created a furore. The Congregational and other churches responded by immediately establishing missions in the East End, and the government responded by appointing the royal commission on the housing of the working classes (1884&#150;5). The pamphlet inspired the settlement house movement and encouraged a widespread, fresh examination of the social consequences of urbanization and unregulated capitalism, and what the Congregational assembly in 1885 termed &#145;the inequalities which unjust laws and customs produce&#146;  (<span class="italic">Congregational Year Book</span>, 1886, 17).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Bitter Cry</span>, issued by the London Congregational Union, was anonymous, and soon after its appearance Congregational minister, W. C. Preston, in a series of letters to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, claimed authorship. Mearns hotly disputed the claim in the same newspaper and in the pages of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, and when he was called as a witness before the royal commission on the housing of the working classes, Mearns laid claim to being the &#145;responsible author&#146;  (&#145;Royal commission&#146;, 30.175, 180). When Mearns offered to bring forward the co-workers on <span class="italic">The Bitter Cry</span> as witnesses on his behalf, Preston did not press his claim. It would appear that the initial conception of the inquiry came from Mearns, and that he gathered the information and compiled the social and economic statistics, and, although he handed over his materials and drafts to be written up by Preston, Mearns wrote much of the text, keeping a firm editorial grip on the whole, and revised the final draft. <span class="italic">The Congregationalist</span> argued, &#145;It is but common justice to say the credit of this entire work belongs to Mr Mearns&#146;  (12, 1883, 908). In 1906 Mearns, who had lived in Chelsea, Bishopsgate, Brixton, and Upper Norwood, retired as secretary of the London Congregational Union and left London to live at 35 The Esplanade, Burnham-on-Sea, near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where, vigorous to the end, he died on 25 August 1925.<br>
