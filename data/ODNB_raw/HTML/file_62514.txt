<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ponting,  Herbert George</span>  (1870&#150;1935), <span class="occ">photographer and film-maker</span>, was born on 21 March 1870 in Market Place, Salisbury, Wiltshire, the son of Francis William Ponting, a bank manager, and his wife, Mary Sydenham. After a restless youth he emigrated to California, USA, where he took up fruit farming, learned photography, and married. But the lure of travel, once he was armed with a camera, proved incompatible with domesticity. In 1901 he left his wife and young children and embarked on the first of many photographic trips to the Far East, where he visited Japan, Manchuria, Korea, and Russia, and recorded the Russo-Japanese War. Although he travelled in China and India in 1906&#150;7, and also visited Java and Burma, his great love was Japan, which led to his first illustrated book, <span class="italic">In Lotus-Land Japan</span> (1910).<br>
<br>Having also photographed Swiss and French mountains, Ponting was regarded as the best outdoor cameraman in the world when in 1909 Captain Robert Scott invited him to join the Antarctic expedition he was organizing. Convinced that moving pictures were now an essential aspect of expedition coverage (and financing), he set about learning their technique with a crash course from the manufacturer Alfred Newman, one of whose Newman-Sinclair cameras was specially adapted for polar conditions. Ponting began his record of the expedition on board the <i>Terra Nova</i>, when his requests for poses became known affectionately as &#145;the peril of ponting for Ponko&#146;. During the long Antarctic winter of 1911 he developed all his breathtaking photographs and thousands of feet of film, as well as teaching photography to his companions and entertaining them with lantern slide lectures on his travels. In October 1911 the first fruits of his &#145;&#147;live&#148; chronicles of life among the snows&#146;, as the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> described it, were seen in London; although it would be over a year before the world had confirmation of Scott's fate.<br>
<br>Ponting bought out Gaumont's rights to the film footage and began lecturing with a combination of film and slides almost daily throughout 1914. He later toured with the same programme and sent copies of the films to the western front, as they began to be regarded not only as Scott's memorial but also as exemplars of moral &#145;devotion to purpose, ideals and duty&#146;. In 1921 Ponting published a long-awaited book on the expedition, <span class="italic">The Great White South</span>, and in 1924&#151;ironically, at the lowest ebb of British film production&#151;issued a feature-length compilation under the same title. None of Ponting's business ventures prospered. He lost his own money on almost all presentations of the Antarctic material, bickered with other surviving expedition members over alleged infringement of his rights, and invested in a variety of disastrous novelties, such as the &#145;Distortograph&#146; system for producing photographic caricatures. Determined that his film should become &#145;a national possession&#146;, he succeeded in having it formally accepted by the duke of York (later George VI) on behalf of the short-lived British Empire Film Institute in 1929, but was again disappointed by the financial outcome.<br>
<br>With the coming of synchronized sound, Ponting decided that this would &#145;very greatly add to the interest of the story&#146;, and embarked on three years of painstaking work to create a new version at what was then the vast cost of &pound;10,000. His confidence was justified, when the resulting <span class="italic">Ninety Degrees South</span> (1933) was acknowledged to be highly effective, with an introduction by Scott's former second-in-command, Lieutenant (now Vice-Admiral) E. R. G. Evans, and commentary by Ponting, drawing on his years of experience in presenting the material. Reworking the material restored the story's intrinsic, if understated, drama, allowing its humour and intimacy, as well as its outstanding wildlife material, to balance the monumental beauty of Ponting's &#145;mastery of ice subjects&#146; that Scott had admired. The film also made use of models and animation to cover the final unphotographed trek, combined with the poignant eloquence of Scott's own diaries. &#145;The Chief&#146;, Ponting recalled on the soundtrack, had joked that he &#145;couldn't wait to see the film at his local cinema&#146;; and here the irony is moving. Sadly, the film did not prove a commercial success and Ponting, by his own account, was &#145;run down physically and cleaned out financially&#146;. He died of a heart attack on 7 February 1935 at 44 Oxford Mansions, Market Place, Oxford Circus, London. Thanks to video, the film has now re-emerged to take its place as an authentic British epic, while Ponting's reputation as a photographer, both of landscape and of the expedition, is secure.<br>
