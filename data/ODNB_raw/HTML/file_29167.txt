</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wharton,  Henry</span>  (1664&#150;1695), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and historian</span>, was born on 9 November 1664 at Worstead, Norfolk, and baptized, probably in the parish, on 20 November, the eldest son of Edmund Wharton (<i>bap</i>. 1635, <i>d</i>. 1717), vicar of Worstead, rector of adjacent Sloley and later of Saxlingham in the same county, and his wife, Susanna, daughter of John Burr, a wealthy clothier of Dedham, Essex. Henry had a younger brother, Edmund, and a sister, Susan. He was born with two tongues, both of the same size and shape. As an infant, he was examined by natural philosophers. The lower tongue gradually receded until it was no longer an impediment.<br>
<br>When he was six Wharton attended school at North Walsham, Norfolk, for a year; thereafter he was taught at home by his father. The surviving extracts from his autobiography record his teenage achievements in Latin and Greek composition and, according to the posthumous biography of him by his near-contemporary Thomas Green, his father's thorough teaching, especially in the classical languages, ensured that &#145;at his entrance into the university he had the reputation of an extraordinary young man&#146;  (Green, sig. A3<i>r</i>). He was admitted pensioner at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 17 February 1680, matriculated the same year, and was elected scholar of his college in November. He graduated BA in 1684. Wharton was a brilliant student, excelling in classics, philosophy, French and Italian, and mathematics: in the last he was one of &#145;a select Company&#146; taught by Isaac Newton &#145;in his private Chamber&#146;  (ibid., sig. A4<i>r</i>). At Cambridge, his biographer observed, Wharton was &#145;in all his Conversation exemplary for Sobriety and good Government of himself, and innocent and obliging in his Behaviour, duly observant of College Orders, and constant in frequenting the Prayers and Sacraments in the Chapel&#146;  (ibid., sig. A4<i>v</i>). <h2>
<a name="Careerandworks"></a>Career and works</h2>However, Wharton was unable to obtain a fellowship, and upon the recommendation of a senior fellow of his college he became the assistant to the church historian William Cave, a position he held from 1686 to 1687. Cave allowed him a salary of &pound;10 a year and access to his library, while Caius allowed him to keep his scholarship until Michaelmas 1687. Wharton collaborated with Cave on his <span class="italic">Scriptorum ecclesiasticorum historia literaria</span> (1688), an account of European writers from ancient times to the Reformation. Wharton wrote most of the section that dealt with the period after 1300, and felt that his contributions were not properly acknowledged. On 27 February 1687 he was ordained deacon by Thomas White, bishop of Peterborough, and in July proceeded MA, the degree being conferred on him by proxy as at the time he was sick with smallpox.<br>
<br>Wharton worked on medieval manuscripts at Cambridge University and in the royal library at St James's during 1687 and 1688. In the latter year he wrote or edited four books which assailed Roman Catholic doctrines for their lack of scriptural and historical foundation. His patron for these works, which included <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Celibacy of the Church</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise Proving Scripture to be the Rule of Faith</span> (both published in 1688) was Thomas Tenison, vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, and future archbishop of Canterbury. In <span class="italic">The Enthusiasm of the Church of Rome Demonstrated</span> (1688) Wharton argued that the &#145;extraordinary Illuminations&#146; of Catholic saints like Loyola testified to the irrationalism and fanaticism of the Roman church, as opposed to the &#145;rational piety&#146; of Anglicanism  (<span class="italic">Enthusiasm</span>, 15).<br>
<br>William Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, became Wharton's patron in 1688. Much impressed by Sancroft's piety and support of learning, Wharton wrote that he could not &#145;be otherwise than diligent&#146; in his scholarship  (Douglas, 143). He was made one of Sancroft's chaplains, ordained priest by him on 9 November 1688, and was licensed to preach throughout Canterbury. Wharton was nominated by him to the rectory of Minster, Kent, in October 1688 and to the rectory of Chartham in the same county in September 1689, positions which he held for the rest of his life. Many of Wharton's clerical duties were performed by curates, thus allowing him time for his scholarly pursuits. He befriended two of Sancroft's domestic chaplains, John Battely, archdeacon of Canterbury, and Henry Maurice, both of whom were scholars of church history.<br>
<br>Wharton was an amazingly productive scholar. He added to the manuscripts in Lambeth Palace, transcribed the treatises in them, and catalogued the collection, sixteen volumes in all; this catalogue forms the basis of the printed catalogue of Lambeth manuscripts and is thus a valuable resource for scholars. He also edited a new edition of Archbishop James Ussher's <span class="italic">Historia dogmatica</span> (1689) and wrote <span class="italic">A defence of pluralities or holding two benefices with cure of souls as now practised in the Church of England</span> (1692). In all his works, Wharton wrote as a champion of the church and defender of its doctrines.<br>
<br>Relations between Wharton and his patron became strained when in 1689 Wharton took the oath of allegiance to William and Mary and publicly prayed in Lambeth chapel for the new sovereigns. Sancroft refused to swear allegiance, and told Wharton not to mention the new sovereigns again in the public prayers. The archbishop was deprived of church office and became the leading nonjuror. He personally scolded Wharton for his breach of faith. During his final illness Sancroft wanted only nonjurors in his company, and Wharton was thus excluded. Nevertheless Wharton remained on friendly terms with Sancroft and with other nonjurors, including George Hickes&#151;sharing their high-church views. In his last days Sancroft turned over to him the diary and manuscripts of the high-church martyr William Laud, which Wharton edited and published in 1695 as <span class="italic">The History of the Troubles and Tryal of &hellip; Dr. William Laud</span>. Wharton called Laud a &#145;Blessed Martyr&#146; who strove to re-establish &#145;the Beauty, the Honour, and the Force of religion&#146;  (unpaginated preface).<br>
<br>Wharton's association with Sancroft hindered his advancement in the post-revolution church. His prospects for preferment were not helped by a literary attack he launched in 1693 against Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who was well connected in church and state. Wharton, employing the pseudonym Anthony Harmer and a sarcastic tone, wrote <span class="italic">A Specimen of Some Errors and Defects in the History of the Reformation &hellip; by Gilbert Burnet</span> (1693), in which he suggested that as a &#145;foreigner&#146; the Scottish Burnet was not up to the task of writing about the English Reformation  (Wharton, pt 4, 161). This provoked a spirited rejoinder from the bishop who, among other things, accused Wharton of aiding and abetting popery in his <span class="italic">Specimen</span>.<br>
<br>Relations between Wharton and Burnet were strained even before Wharton's critique. The whiggish Burnet was an adversary of Sancroft and rebuffed Wharton when he approached him after the revolution in hopes of winning his favour. Wharton believed that Burnet blocked his attempt to become one of Queen Mary's chaplains. Burnet, who had criticized Wharton's <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> (discussed below) in 1691, believed it was revenge which motivated Wharton to write the <span class="italic">Specimen</span>. He complained of the incivility and &#145;sourness&#146; which Wharton had displayed in the <span class="italic">Specimen</span>  (Burnet, 28).<br>
<br>Not all of Wharton's relations with whig eminences were so contentious. His connection to Thomas Tenison has already been noted. Tenison's predecessor as archbishop, John Tillotson, allowed Wharton continued access to the Lambeth manuscripts. While he was Sancroft's chaplain, Wharton befriended William Lloyd, bishop of St Asaph (1680&#150;89) and of Lichfield and Coventry (1692&#150;9). Lloyd had urged Burnet to write his <span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span> and offered him valuable assistance on the project. Indeed Burnet's retort to Wharton's <span class="italic">Specimen</span> was his <span class="italic">Letter &hellip; to the Ld Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield</span> (1693). <h2>
<a name="Historianofthemedievalchurch"></a>Historian of the medieval church</h2>Wharton wrote or edited over twenty books during his short life. His most important work was <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> (1691), written in Latin and published in two folio volumes of over 1500 pages. <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> was a collection of medieval manuscripts that chronicled the history of the English church. The first volume consisted of histories, written by monks, of the monastic cathedrals&#151;Canterbury, Winchester, Rochester, Norwich, Coventry and Lichfield, Bath and Wells, Durham, and Ely. The second volume contained the lives of bishops and the history of their sees. Wharton wrote the concluding sections of the narratives, which continued the chronicles to the Reformation. A letter in 1689 described his research:<blockquote>Considering that the history of our church before the Reformation was little known, and that great numbers of the civil antient histories were already published &hellip; I resolved to make a collection of histories purely ecclesiastical, and publish them together &hellip; When I had gained many of these histories and caused them to be transcribed out of several libraries, I found that they were all particular of some one church, relating almost wholly to the affairs of that church of which the writer was a monk or canon. Hence I immediately conceived, that if such histories could be found of every episcopal see, a perfect history of our bishops would then arise &hellip; I have turned over innumerable registers, histories etc., and procured much from other persons. (Douglas, 145&#150;6)</blockquote>Wharton did not completely realize his vision. He finished his history of the monastic sees, but not of those served by secular canons.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> made a major contribution to the sources of medieval English history. It enabled scholars to canvass and compare a wealth of medieval chronicles. The lives of many English prelates appeared in print for the first time, including John of Salisbury's life of St Anselm, William of Malmesbury's life of Wulfstan, and Eadmer's lives of Bregwim and St Oswald. <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> was used extensively by later scholars. John Lingard and William Stubbs were among the nineteenth-century historians who drew upon it.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span> ran counter to the conventional wisdom of Wharton's time which held that the pre-Reformation church, mired in superstition and popery, was not a subject that merited extensive scholarly research. Similarly, his pseudonymous <span class="italic">Specimen of Some Errors</span>, though far less influential than <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span>, was an original work of scholarship. In this 200-page book Wharton anticipated modern historians by arguing that the late medieval church showed many signs of spirituality and vitality, and challenged the commonplace view, expressed by Bishop Burnet, that the pre-Reformation church was corrupt and oppressive. Where Burnet saw only ignorance and sloth in the monastaries, Wharton found learning and piety.<br>
<br>Burnet was wrong when he said that suffragan bishops had been abolished in the late medieval church and were only revived with the Reformation. &#145;If the Historian&#146;, wrote Wharton, &#145;had pleased to acquaint himself with the State of the Church of England before the Reformation, he could not have been Ignorant, that for about 200 years before the Reformation, Suffragan Bishops had been frequent in England&#146;  (Jones, 123). And Wharton objected to the anti-clerical, Erastian bias of Burnet's <span class="italic">History</span>. He took issue with Burnet's view that papal interference increased during the late middle ages. Kings frequently had their way in the appointment of bishops, no more so than in the sixty years before the Reformation.<br>
<br>Wharton disputes Burnet's view that the papacy imposed &#145;cruel exactions&#146; over kings and parliaments right up to the Reformation. &#145;Our Ancestors&#146;, he wrote, correctly, &#145;had before the Reformation got the better of the Court of Rome in many points converted between them&#146;  (Wharton, 8). He argues, against Burnet, that the <span class="roman">Statutes of Provisors</span> and <span class="italic">Praemunire</span> were effective in limiting papal interference. Throughout the <span class="italic">Specimen</span> Wharton compared Burnet's transcription of documents with the originals and found them to be faulty: he submitted that &#145;the Reformation of our Church was begun and carried out with so much piety, wisdom, and fulness of due Authority that a faithful and exact Account is the best Vindication and defence of it&#146;  (Wharton, 160).<br>
<br>There is no contradiction between the anti-Catholic works which Wharton undertook for Thomas Tenison and the balanced portrayal of the pre-Reformation church displayed in the <span class="italic">Specimen of Some Errors</span> and <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span>. The latter was a major work of scholarship, but its empathetic portrayal of the medieval church also reflected the Laudian, high-church view that the pre-Reformation church, though marked by abuses, was a true Christian church, meriting close study. Wharton's anti-Catholic works were written under the direction of a whig churchman who was campaigning against the widely perceived threat of popery in the reign of James II. The paradox was that many Restoration clerics, like Wharton, decried the errors of Rome, but did not view Roman Catholicism as idolatrous. <h2>
<a name="Personaltraitsanddeath"></a>Personal traits and death</h2>Wharton was of middle height, handsome, strong, with a dark complexion. Devoting his life to scholarship, he never married. In his autobiography he recounted how he resisted the temptations of vice and preserved his virginity. He was very serious, self-assured, and energetic. He worked tirelessly on his scholarship, more than twelve hours a day, standing up as he wrote. He ignored cold weather, writing until his hands and feet were numb. This disregard for his health may have contributed to his early death. He continued to live at Canterbury until 1694, when he moved to his rectory in Chartham. In his final months he was burdened with clerical duties and regretted that his scholarly activity languished. He fell ill during the summer of 1694 and travelled to Bath, Somerset, in hopes that the mineral waters there would cure him. But he died in Chartham on 5 March 1695, probably of tuberculosis, at the age of thirty.<br>
<br>Wharton was buried in Westminster Abbey on 8 March. His funeral was performed by Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester and dean of Westminster, and there were many bishops (including Tenison and Lloyd, who had both visited him during his last illness) in attendance, as well as the abbey's prebendaries and the king's scholars. Anthems were written specifically for the occasion by Henry Purcell. The pomp and ceremony of Wharton's funeral indicate that his scholarly achievements were not unrecognized during his lifetime. Posthumous publications included a two-volume collection of the sermons that he had preached at Lambeth prefaced by Green's biography, which went through three editions (1697&#150;8, 1700, and 1728). His autobiography in Latin apparently no longer survives. However, extensive extracts from it were copied by Thomas Birch and were eventually published in 1821 as an appendix to George D'Oyly's biography of Archbishop Sancroft.<br>
