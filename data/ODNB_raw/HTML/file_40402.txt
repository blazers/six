<span class="headword">Hastie,  William</span>  (1754/5&#150;1832), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, arrived in Russia in 1784, aged twenty-nine, as one of a group of seventy-three Scottish workmen recruited by the architect Charles Cameron (1745&#150;1812) to work for the empress Catherine the Great at Tsarskoe Selo near St Petersburg. Many of them returned to Scotland in 1790 after the expiry of a second three-year contract, when work on the cold baths complex and the colonnade that became known as the Cameron Gallery was at an end. Hastie, a stonemason by trade, was apparently among those who were offered an extension and an opportunity in his case to develop a talent for architectural drawing and design that may well have been encouraged by Cameron, who had advertised, initially and unsuccessfully, for &#145;two clerks &hellip; who can draw well&#146; (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span>, 21 Jan 1784, cited in Cross, &#145;Cameron's Scottish workmen&#146;, 53).<br>
<br>It is as apprentice architect or &#145;architectural candidate&#146; that he entered state service in 1792, and as such, two years later, in August 1794, he submitted for the empress's approval an album of fifty-seven designs of country houses and garden pavilions, generally drawn in Indian ink and sometimes water-coloured and inspired in part by existing English essays in the neo-classical and neo-Gothic. Catherine was impressed: &#145;c'est un sujet tres recommandable: il a fait des choses charmantes&#146;  (Cross, &#145;Cameron's Scottish workmen&#146;, 68). Recommend she did, and within months, on 5 July 1795, Hastie, or Vasily Geste, as he was known in Russia, was invited by Prince Platon Zubov, the last of the empress's favourites and recently made governor-general of the Yekaterinoslav and Taurida regions, to become his principal architect. Hastie, probably with his new wife Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bryce, daughter of one of his fellow stonemasons, whom he had married in St Petersburg on 23 January 1795, travelled to the Crimea, where he remained until his dismissal on 3 July 1799. The only evidence of his work there was yet again an album, preserved today in the St Petersburg public library. It comprises thirty-four sheets of views of all the principal towns, and historically important measured drawings of monuments, among which, most notably, was the former palace of the khans at Bakhchisaray.<br>
<br>Hastie's first employment on his return to St Petersburg presents yet another unexpected twist in his career, for he is next encountered in 1801, already into the reign of Alexander I, drawing up plans for the reconstruction of the admiralty's Izhora ironworks at Kolpino, south of the capital. He was reunited with James Wilson (1749&#150;1821), a master smith from the 1784 group of Scottish craftsmen, and the latter's eldest son, Alexander Wilson (1776&#150;1866), who later achieved extraordinary eminence in Russia as an engineer. All were subordinate to yet another Scot, Charles Gascoigne (1738&#150;1806), former director of the Carron ironworks at Falkirk, who had arrived in 1786. It was during this period that Hastie was introduced to the new techniques of cast-iron construction that he was soon to put to practical use in his next appointment to the Office of Waterways, where from 1804 he designed the series of bridges in St Petersburg that brought him wide recognition. On 14 November 1806 the Police Bridge, spanning the River Moika at the junction with Nevsky Prospect, was officially opened. Eighty-eight feet long and consisting of fourteen bolted cast-iron arches, it set the standard design for bridges over the capital's waterways, constructed by Hastie and others. He himself was responsible for building five of the ten bridges he designed between 1806 and 1810. In 1817 he was awarded a state pension specifically for his work as a bridge designer, although his career had by then taken another decisive turn, bringing him an even greater reputation as a town planner.<br>
<br>Continuing to work in the capital, Hastie was appointed chief architect at Tsarskoe Selo in 1808, when the tsar raised it to the status of a regional town and ordered nearby Sofia, which Cameron had designed and where Hastie and his fellow workmen had lived, to be dismantled. Hastie produced a plan, but did not oversee the town's construction, which was delayed by the war of 1812&#150;14. The present-day town nevertheless preserves some of the essential features of Hastie's original layout; and one of the few houses he built there&#151;a two-storeyed wooden house built in 1820&#151;still stands and was the home of the poet Anna Akhmatova in her early years.<br>
<br>Hastie's appointment at Tsarskoe Selo had been a consequence of his contribution to the building committee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which he had joined in 1806, along with the architect Adam Menelaws (1749&#150;1831), yet another eminent graduate of the 1784 group. In 1809 he produced in collaboration with the Italian architect Luigi Rusca an album of standardized fa&ccedil;ades for private two- and three-storeyed houses in towns throughout Russia that became part of a grand overall strategy to impose classical conformity and regularity. House design was but part of Hastie's overall responsibilities and involvement. In 1811&#150;12 he produced and published in 450 sets a series of twenty-six plans for standardized town districts and squares in all manner of variations. By this time he had been assigned to the Ministry of Police, which had assumed responsibility for the planning and regulating of towns. He was to be given enormous authority and power and for nearly twenty years he was the empire's master town planner.<br>
<br>After the Moscow fire in 1812 Hastie produced a plan for the city's reconstruction that won the tsar's approval but was ultimately rejected as impossibly expensive and impractical. It proposed vast open squares, raking prospects, and wide boulevards on a scale only achieved in the Soviet period. His imprint was to be more lasting, for better or worse, on many other Russian towns, from Belorussia and the Baltic to Siberia (Omsk and Tomsk), from Onega in the north to Kiev and Yekaterinoslav in the south. He visited far from all of the towns on which his standard designs were imposed and far from always was he alive to the problems of local topography. He was the standard-bearer of uniformity and its common companion, monotony, and throughout his career he remained true to his concept of the town planned on classical principles, such as he had encountered in Cameron's Sofia. None the less his influence on Russian town planning, extending beyond his death, was enormous and far-reaching. He died on 4 June 1832 and was buried in the protestant cemetery at Tsarskoe Selo.<br>
