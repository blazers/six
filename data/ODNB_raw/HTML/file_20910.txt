<span class="headword">O'Sullivan Beare,  Donnell Cam</span>, count of Bearehaven in the Spanish nobility  (1560&#150;1618), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was the son of Donnell, chief of the O'Sullivan Beare in co. Kerry, and Margaret O'Brien, daughter of the O'Brien of Thomond. In 1563 his father was killed by a McGillycuddy and was succeeded by Donnell's uncle Owen O'Sullivan Beare. Owen regarded his young nephew as a threat and banished Donnell to his mother's country, in Eyeries on the south side of the Kenmare River. He was educated in Waterford and learned to speak fluent English. When, in 1580, Owen was imprisoned in Limerick on suspicion of conspiring to rebel, he agreed to put Beare, in co. Cork, in Donnell's charge. In return, Donnell acknowledged Owen as his adopted father, a decision he subsequently regretted. During this confused period, as guardian of Beare, Donnell appears to have been in rebellion against the crown, probably on the advice of Owen's supporters. Certainly, in December 1581 he engaged and routed in battle at Carberry a raiding party composed mainly of Gaelic allies of the crown.<br>
<br>Owen was probably released early in 1582, and he granted Donnell a portion of land within his lordship. However, this accommodation soon broke down and Donnell was expelled once more. Donnell then turned to the English law of primogeniture as a means of regaining his father's country, and from 1584 appeared regularly in London to plead his case. Owen and Donnell vied to prove their loyalty to the crown, and each accused the other of involvement in the Desmond rebellion of 1579&#150;83. Neither was entirely innocent, but Owen had much the longer record of disloyalty.<br>
<br>In May 1587 the case was heard before the lord deputy and privy council of Ireland, who recommended that Donnell receive a portion of Beare after Owen's death and be given a pension paid out of Owen's rents until then. However, Donnell, dissatisfied, appealed to the English privy council in London. When Donnell and Owen outlined their respective positions before the privy council in London in July 1591, it could not come to a decision because of a lack of reliable evidence and decided to send a commission to Beare to examine witnesses. Finally, on 5 June 1593 the privy council ruled that Beare be partitioned between Donnell, Owen, and Owen's brother Phillip. Crucially, although Owen was granted the bulk of the land, Donnell received the castle of Dunboy and its environs. Dunboy was probably the best harbour in south-west Ireland, enabling its possessor to levy tolls on Spanish and French fishermen who trawled the thriving fisheries off the coast of Cork and Kerry. The loss of these revenues undermined Owen's authority, and in 1594 Donnell was formally elected O'Sullivan Beare in his stead.<br>
<br>Donnell's gains were soon jeopardized by the growing political instability in Munster, caused mainly by the success enjoyed by Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, in his rebellion against the government. For the next seven years O'Sullivan appeared outwardly loyal, and when Tyrone marched triumphantly into Munster in 1600 O'Sullivan was one of the few chieftains who ignored his summons. However, his real attitude towards the crown may well have been more ambiguous. He was close to another ostensibly loyalist Gaelic chieftain, Florence McCarthy Reagh, who was secretly encouraging Spanish intervention in Ireland on behalf of the rebels. It should also be noted that sources of O'Sullivan's later years show him to have been a very zealous Catholic.<br>
<br>When the Spanish landed at Kinsale on 2 October 1601 O'Sullivan supported them enthusiastically and handed over Dunboy to a Spanish garrison. He led about 1000 men under Tyrone at the disastrous battle of Kinsale on 24 December 1601. Following the battle he attempted to submit to the government, but the English refused to pardon him. Before fleeing back to Ulster, Tyrone appointed O'Sullivan head of the rebel forces in Munster. O'Sullivan commanded about 2000 men and over the next year became the main symbol of continued Irish resistance.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in January 1602 the leader of the Spanish expedition agreed terms with the English, which included the handing over of Dunboy. O'Sullivan hastened back to Beare, and through subterfuge managed to seize Dunboy from its Spanish garrison. He immediately dispatched letters to the king of Spain, apologizing for his actions and appealing for further aid. Some help did eventually arrive from Spain, but not enough to make a difference. The sheer inaccessibility of Dunboy and its surrounds enabled O'Sullivan to engage in a protracted, but hopeless, rearguard action. The strategic importance of Dunboy prompted Sir George Carew, lord president of Munster, to devote all his resources to taking it. The castle fell in late June 1602 after a skilfully conducted siege by Carew. During the latter half of 1602 O'Sullivan's allies melted away, and by year's end he was effectively cornered in Bantry. In late December a royal force of about 2000 engaged the remnants of his forces at Glengariff. After a fierce battle the English made off with O'Sullivan's cattle, leaving him with no means to sustain his army. Starved of supplies, he decided to march out of Munster, hoping to link up with Tyrone. In the epic march that followed his forces suffered terribly from almost continuous attacks from English forces and from Irish eager to prove their loyalty. They enjoyed a brief respite on crossing the Shannon at Portland, co. Tipperary, but on reaching Aughrim, in co. Galway, were confronted by numerically superior forces commanded by Captain Henry Malby and Henry Burke. O'Sullivan roused his men into a desperate assault, which routed their surprised enemies. On 14 January 1603 he and thirty-four survivors reached the relative safety of Leitrim, having traversed 200 miles in fourteen days in the depths of winter. After resting, O'Sullivan entered Ulster only to discover that Tyrone had already surrendered.<br>
<br>In June 1603 O'Sullivan accompanied Tyrone and Rory O'Donnell to London to speak with the newly crowned James I. However, he was refused a pardon. He returned to Ireland and, in spring 1605, sailed into La Corunna, Spain, with several hundred followers. There he helped found the Irish college at Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. Early in 1606 his men were shipped to Flanders, but he went to Madrid to pursue a career as a courtier. He was granted a pension, admitted to the prestigious Spanish order of Santiago in 1607, and created count of Bearehaven in 1617. Shortly before his death O'Sullivan was apparently involved in plans to initiate a rebellion in Munster. On 16 July 1618 O'Sullivan was killed by John Bathe outside Madrid, apparently after a dispute over money. The circumstances of his death are obscure and quite suspicious, given that Bathe was a spy for the English government. O'Sullivan had two sons with his wife, Elena, daughter of O'Sullivan Mor.<br>
