<span class="headword">Kirk,  Thomas</span>  (1781&#150;1845), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Cork, the son of William Kirk, a native of Edinburgh, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bible. His parents moved to Cork from Newry, co. Down, but Kirk settled in Dublin in early life and studied in the drawing schools of the Royal Dublin Society where he won medals in 1797 and 1800. He was then employed as an ornamental stonecarver by Henry Darley, a stonecutter. He established himself as a sculptor at 21 Jervis Street and became noted for his fine work in relief on mantelpieces and monuments. His busts also gained him a rapid reputation, and they were considered remarkable for the delicate handling of the marble and for distinctness of detail. Seventy of these have been recorded; many are described in W. G. Strickland's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Irish Artists</span>. In March 1808 he married Eliza Robinson (1788&#150;1869), daughter of Joseph Robinson, a builder, of Golden Lane, Dublin; they had twelve children. One son, Joseph Robinson Kirk (1821&#150;1894), became a sculptor and a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy; others were the Revd William Boyton Kirk DD, and the Very Revd Francis J. Kirk of St Mary of the Angels, Bayswater, London. Of their four daughters&#151;Mary, Anne, Elizabeth (Eliza), and Margaret (or Catherine)&#151;Eliza Kirk (<i>b</i>. 1812) became a sculptor.<br>
<br>In 1810 Kirk exhibited <span class="italic">Piety and Chastity</span> (Dublin Pro-Cathedral) at the Society of Artists in Dublin&#151;the first time he had shown at that institution. On the foundation of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1823 he was chosen as one of the founder members, and he exhibited there for the rest of his life. He was successful in the competition for the Nelson monument in Dublin, and executed the 13 foot high statue of the admiral in Portland stone on the memorial column in Sackville Street (O'Connell Street; 1808, destr. 1966), which established his reputation. Another major public monument was the colossal statue of Thomas Spring-Rice, Lord Monteagle, at Limerick, exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1821. He also executed a marble statue of George IV in the Linen Hall, Dublin (exh. RHA 1827) and one of the duke of Wellington (exh. RHA 1829); and a model for that of George III for the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, which was carried out in marble by John Bacon the younger. Possibly his most important work was the statue of Admiral Sir Sidney Smith (exh. RA, 1839), commissioned by parliament and placed in the Royal Naval Hospital in Greenwich. Many of his busts, which were esteemed for their accurate and expressive modelling and their faithfulness as likenesses, are in the premises of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Royal Dublin Society, the library of Trinity College, and elsewhere in Dublin. Among them are busts of Thomas Moore (exh. RHA 1829 and other versions), J. Wilson Croker (1819, Hawkins Street, Dublin), Angelica Catalani (exh. RHA 1826), Francis Johnson (exh. RHA 1827, destr.), and Bartholomew Lloyd, provost of Trinity College, Dublin. Among his groups were <span class="italic">The Young Champion</span> and <span class="italic">The Young Suppliant</span> (both exh. RHA 1843), executed for Lord de Grey when lord lieutenant, and <span class="italic">The Orphan Girl</span> (1832, Thomas Abbot memorial) and the Nathaniel Sneyd memorial&#151;both in Christ Church, Dublin; in his funerary memorials he favoured reliefs on the theme of the good Samaritan. Other works were <span class="italic">The Young Dogstealer</span> for Viscount Powerscourt (1840) and figures of Hibernia, Mercury, and Fidelity (1817) on the pediment of the General Post Office in Dublin. One of his finest was <span class="italic">The Parting Glance</span>, the memorial to Lady Rossmore (exh. RHA 1843) in Monaghan&#151;a neo-classical deathbed scene tempered with Victorian sentiment. He also made the figure of a sailor (1817), 12 feet high and cast in metal, as a navigational aid at the entrance to Sligo harbour. Kirk died in Dublin on 19 April 1845 and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery in Dublin. On his tomb is a life-size female figure, the work of his son, Joseph Robinson Kirk.<br>
