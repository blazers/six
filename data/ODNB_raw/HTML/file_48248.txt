<span class="headword">Jones,  Jenkin</span>  (1779&#150;1837), <span class="occ">insurance company manager</span>, was the son of Jenkin Jones and Sophia Jones (<i>d</i>. 1823) of Molesey, Surrey. In 1792, at the age of twelve, he joined the staff of the Phoenix Fire Office, Britain's second largest fire insurer, and the world's leading insurance exporter, and rose rapidly through the clerical ranks to become assistant secretary in 1802. In 1805, aged only twenty-five, he was appointed secretary to the company. He became assistant director in 1833.<br>
<br>Within two months of his appointment as secretary, Jones travelled to Germany and Scandinavia on the first of several trouble-shooting missions abroad, which became landmarks in his career. In 1807, following a huge fire on the Caribbean island of St Thomas, which nearly bankrupted Phoenix, with its extensive insurances of the sugar trade, Jones set sail for Barbados on his lengthiest and most difficult tour. Recognizing the danger of this wartime mission, Phoenix granted Jones &pound;1000 in advance for his services, and effected an assurance on his life to provide a &pound;150 annuity for his mother. Between November 1807 and July 1809 he visited some twenty cities and towns in the West Indies, Canada, and the eastern seaboard of the United States. In Grenada he fell ill with malaria, in Washington he was introduced to President Jefferson, and while in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore he negotiated tariff agreements with local offices, the first such agreements concluded anywhere abroad by a British insurer. On behalf of Phoenix's sister office, Pelican Life, he also appointed Phoenix's agent in Philadelphia as the first life-assurance agent in the United States.<br>
<br>Jones's reports to the Phoenix board, often accompanied by detailed drawings, were notable for their clarity and vigorous comment on the quality of the company's agents, the spread of risks insured, the standards of urban construction, and the level of competition from other insurance offices. The overall result of his work was to rationalize the system of foreign underwriting and to reinforce the company's belief in the market opportunities offered by the New World. Partly as a result of this, Phoenix, and by extension Britain, retained its dominance of the world's insurance exports well into the nineteenth century. Acknowledged as the foremost expert on overseas insurance, at home Jones worked for greater co-operation between provincial and London insurers. In 1830 and 1833, over months of arduous negotiations, he brought together nearly two dozen fire offices in local tariff agreements for Scotland and Liverpool, a success which foreshadowed the more comprehensive tariff co-operation of the 1840s and beyond. Jones also pioneered the development of the modern merger strategy. Beginning with Phoenix's purchase of the Glasgow Fire Office in 1811, he negotiated eight further take-overs, culminating in the purchase of the Protector Fire Office in 1837, probably Britain's biggest corporate merger of the first half of the nineteenth century. Although his underwriting instincts were not always sound, Jones had the charm and tactical judgement of a successful diplomat. His greatest strength lay in his awareness that good information is the lifeblood of good insurance practice, and that such information must be managed effectively.<br>
<br>From about 1820 Jones lived with his wife, Hannah Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1834), and widowed mother in the &#145;neat Gothic Cottage&#146; on Holders Hill, Hendon, Middlesex. On 11 April 1837, during the final stages of the Protector negotiations, he collapsed suddenly in the street, while walking home from the London coach, and died &#145;almost immediately&#146;. An exhumation and inquest were only narrowly averted by Jones's relatives after two anonymous letters were received by the Middlesex coroner from &#145;an old inhabitant of Hendon&#146; demanding, on behalf of Hendon residents, and in the name of &#145;legality&#146;, an inquest into the sudden death. Jones was interred in Hendon churchyard next to his wife and near his mother, both of whom had predeceased him.<br>
