<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemp,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1610?), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was the most important stage clown working in the late Elizabethan period. He was the original performer of some of Shakespeare's most famous comic roles, but contemporaries knew him best as a maker of jigs and merriments, of which the most celebrated was his feat, performed in 1600, of dancing a morris from London to Norwich. His comic persona was that of a plain man who surmounted his social disadvantages through his surprising wit and physical dexterity.<br>
<br>Kemp's parentage is unknown, though it has been conjectured that, despite his plebeian performance persona, he was linked in some way to the Kempes of Ollantighe, near Ashford in Kent, who were a wealthy Catholic dynasty. Sir Thomas Kempe (1517&#150;1591) did indeed have a son named William; however, the claim that this William Kempe was the actor cannot be correct, since he was buried at Wye church on 27 March 1597 (Honneyman, 125&#150;9; Bannerman, 3; private information, A. Findlay). Nonetheless, this putative connection might help explain the otherwise surprising story&#151;dramatized in the play <span class="italic">The Travailes of the Three English Brothers</span> (1607) by Day, Rowley, and Wilkins&#151;that when William Kemp the actor was in Italy in 1601 he had an encounter with the celebrated traveller Sir Anthony Shirley: for Sir Anthony and his two equally famous brothers were related to the Ollantighe Kempes through their mother, who was Sir Thomas Kempe's daughter. Possibly, then, the actor had some tie of kinship to Ollantighe, at an outlying point on the family tree; or perhaps in recommending himself to Shirley he was just opportunistically taking advantage of the name he shared with Shirley's mother.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Kemp's earliest notices link him to the Earl of Leicester's Players in the 1580s. He was not, as sometimes stated, the &#145;Mr Kempe&#146; to whom the corporation of Ipswich sent a letter in 1580 at about the date that Leicester's Men were performing there  (Eccles, 293). He did, though, perform with the earl's company at Leicester House in London in May 1585, and was one of fifteen players who travelled to the Netherlands in November, when Leicester took up his post as general of English forces in the Netherlands. Kemp seems to have contributed to the general air of ostentation that marked Leicester's disconcertingly regal entourage. He would have performed in shows such as &#145;The Forces [=Labours?] of Hercules&#146; at Utrecht in April 1586, but he also provided special feats of impromptu clowning and athleticism. One record has him leaping into a ditch while the earl was out walking with Prince Maurice: presumably this was some kind of tumbling trick. Leicester had already singled Kemp out for an individual reward of 10<i>s</i>. in May 1585, and he received further special payments in the Netherlands. The earl's nephew Sir Philip Sidney called him &#145;William, my Lord of Leicester['s] jesting player&#146;, and used him in January 1586 to carry correspondence home to Lady Sidney  (<span class="italic">The Complete Works of Sir Philip Sidney</span>, ed. A. Feuillerat, 4 vols., 1912&#150;26, 3.167). Unfortunately Kemp embarrassed Sidney by delivering his letters to Lady Leicester, who was the subject in them of some undiplomatic remarks.<br>
<br>Returning to London in May 1586, Kemp immediately embarked on a second continental journey by joining five other English &#145;instrumentalists and tumblers&#146; in the entourage of the Danish ambassador, Henrik Ramel  (Sjogren, 121). This group, which included two future members of Shakespeare's company, George Bryan and Thomas Pope, accompanied Ramel home to the Danish court at Elsinore and worked for three months in the employ of Frederick II. There they probably provided music and pastimes for banquets and other social occasions. When Kemp next becomes locatable, in 1592, he was again in company with Bryan and Pope, performing in England with Lord Strange's Men. However, in the interim he had pursued his own way, for he did not follow the others to Dresden but left Elsinore in August, a month before the rest, and with a month's wages as a gift. Travelling independently with his &#145;boy&#146;, Daniel Jones, Kemp may still have been operating essentially as a solo entertainer.<br>
<br>By 1590 Kemp had begun to amass a considerable reputation as a comic performer. Richard Tarlton, the revered clown of the Queen's Men, died in 1588, and Kemp rapidly replaced him in public esteem as the most admired comedian of the next decade. The earliest testimony to his popularity comes in Thomas Nashe's <span class="italic">An Almond for a Parrat</span> (1590). This satirical tract opens with a mock dedication from &#145;Cuthbert Curry-knave&#146; to &#145;that most comical and conceited cavalier, Monsieur du Kemp, jestmonger and vice-gerent general to the ghost of Dick Tarlton&#146;, asking Kemp to receive his pamphlet and &#145;with the credit of thy clownery protect thy Cuthbert from carpers&#146;. Cuthbert claims that during a visit to Bergamo he had met &#145;that famous francatrip Harlicken [i.e. Harlequin]&#146;, who asked &#145;if I knew any such parabolano here in London as Signior Ciarlatano Kempino&#146;, adding that &#145;for the report he had heard of his pleasance, he could not but be in love with his perfections&#146;. This was an elaborate spoof designed to preface the ensuing pamphlet with a disclaimer of serious intent, but it signalled how famous in London Kemp's &#145;pleasances&#146; had become. Two years later, another of Nashe's pamphlets twitted Gabriel Harvey by suggesting that his actions would &#145;fall to [Kemp's] lot for a merriment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, 1.287, 3.342&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Kempsmerriments"></a>Kemp's merriments</h2>Kemp's merriments were of two kinds. The anonymous play <span class="italic">A Knack to Know a Knave</span>, printed in 1594 with &#145;Kemp's applauded merriments of the men of Gotham&#146;  (title page), indicates that in some plays he provided independent comic episodes, self-contained farcical skits with minimal integration into the surrounding action. In the play the &#145;madmen&#146; of Gotham, a cobbler, a miller, and a smith, squabble over who is to present a petition at King Edgar's visit. With much malapropism and absurd logic they compete over who will do it most wisely, but when the petition is read, it is a ridiculous request that travellers arriving in their town be compelled to purchase ale. It is easy to see how, through improvisation and by-play, this inconsequential scene could be elaborated beyond its intrinsic interest into a clowning routine that temporarily hijacked the action. It has been plausibly suggested that the semi-detached scene in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> involving a common man who mistakes words, and who is sent on a fool's errand resulting in his execution, was an episode written in for Kemp  (Wiles, 34). A reference in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man out of his Humour</span> (1599) to Kemp throwing his shoe at another player perhaps preserves a memory of one more merriment. In the anonymous play <span class="italic">The Return from Parnassus</span>, part 2 (performed at St John's College, Cambridge, at Christmas 1601&#150;2), in which Kemp is brought on stage as a character, his comic turn is a speech parodying a foolish justice of the peace.<br>
<br>Kemp's other speciality was the jig or comic afterpiece, a song-and-dance routine that was customarily performed at the end of a play by up to five actors led by the clown: as Nashe explained, &#145;the quaint comedians of our time &hellip; when their play is done do fall to rhyme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, 1.244). Danced to ballad tunes and rooted in folk culture and popular story-telling, jigs were a distinctly low form of comedy. Their rambunctious and frequently bawdy humour often contrasted radically with the plays to which they were attached, and they acquired a reputation for coarseness and scandal. When, in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (II.ii), Polonius interrupts the first player's tragical &#145;Pyrrhus&#146; speech, the prince's put-down&#151;&#145;he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry&#146;&#151;is meant to be cutting. None the less, jigs had a loyal audience following, and some spectators would arrive at a play's close simply for the sake of the ensuing afterpiece.<br>
<br>At least six of Kemp's jigs had reached print by 1595, and he must have been responsible for more of which we have no record. Four survive, two of which are in German (the jig being a European, and not a narrowly English, form). In the jig <span class="italic">Rowland</span>, extant only in German, the clown has been cheated of his mistress by a sexton, but wins her back by lying in one of the sexton's graves and surprising the couple with his resurrection. In a German companion piece, <span class="italic">Von den Mannern</span>, the clown's wife catches him out by playing the same trick on him, pretending she has died and punishing him for the infidelities on which he at once embarks. In <span class="italic">Rowland's Godson</span>, the servant John has seduced his master's wife, and by a cunning plot he simultaneously dispels his master's suspicions and arranges for him to be beaten. And in <span class="italic">Singing Simpkin</span>, Simpkin uses a contrivance involving concealment in a chest to enable him to cuckold an old man and outwit a blustering soldier who is trying to seduce the same woman. It will be seen that Kemp's jigs were neatly ironical domestic farces featuring sexual competition and comical violence. Their hero was an ordinary but resourceful man who generally managed to win through despite the odds stacked against him. In the 1590s these beautifully focused and ingenious skits earned Kemp the adulation of the playhouses, though not the approval of more sedate spectators. As one satirist complained in 1598:<blockquote>
<div>whores, beadles, bawds and sergeants filthily<br>
</div>
<div>Chant Kemp's jig.<br>
</div> (Baskerville, 110)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="TheLordChamberlainsMen"></a>The Lord Chamberlain's Men</h2>The 1590s saw Kemp's career at its height. In 1592&#150;4, and probably earlier, he worked with Strange's Men, at this time England's most successful playing company. Led by Edward Alleyn, Strange's performed (when in London) at the Rose in Southwark, and here Kemp would have acted in Kyd's <span class="italic">Spanish Tragedy</span>, Marlowe's <span class="italic">Jew of Malta</span>, and, perhaps, <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span>. Then in 1594 the London companies were completely reorganized. In the new groupings, Kemp emerged with the Lord Chamberlain's Men (Burbage and Shakespeare's company), playing at the Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, with whom he created his remarkable sequence of Shakespearian clowns. He must have become a considerable force in the company. In March 1596, he (together with Shakespeare and Richard Burbage) was the payee for the company's court performances during Christmas 1595&#150;6, and in February 1599 he was one of five players invited by Richard and Cuthbert Burbage to help finance the building of the Globe, in return for a share of the profits. In <span class="italic">The Return from Parnassus</span> (1601&#150;2), Kemp is brought on stage as one of London's two most famous stars: &#145;He's not counted a gentleman that knows not Dick Burbage and Will Kemp&#146;  (Leishman, 339).<br>
<br>Kemp's parts for the Chamberlain's Men are a litany of famous roles: Costard in <span class="italic">Love's Labour's Lost</span> (1594), Peter, the Nurse's servant, in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (<i>c</i>.1595)&#151;the 1599 quarto includes the direction &#145;Enter Will Kemp&#146;&#151;Bottom in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1595&#150;6), Lancelot in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (1597), Dogberry in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (1598), and Cob in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span> (1598). Some scholars think he also created Falstaff, and Lance in <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span>. <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen</span> is an early play, and Lance could easily have been written in later, though Kemp is not otherwise known for a double act with a dog. Falstaff is a difficult case. He has self-evident clown features, such as direct audience address and farcical misadventures, but his role is much more developed than Kemp's usual parts, and his age, size, and gentility do not match Kemp's athleticism and plainness. It is significant that John Lowin, the Falstaff of the next generation, was not a clown but a tragedian. All of Kemp's other attested roles are unpretentious men who plough a fine line between vulgar ignorance and demotic cunning. Often intellectually at sea in the complex affairs into which they stray, they none the less possess a shrewd common sense that allows them more insight into their world than that possessed by their betters&#151;the classic instances being Bottom and Dogberry, who are their plays' real, if unofficial, heroes. All have Kemp's trade marks to a greater or lesser degree: verbal mistaking (such as Dogberry's malapropisms), upside-down epiphany (as in Bottom's &#145;dream&#146;), direct audience address, puzzled soliloquy, and scope for improvisation. Without Kemp in his company, Shakespeare's output in the 1590s&#151;though not unimaginable&#151;would clearly have been significantly different.<h2>
<a name="Theninedayswonderandafter"></a>The nine days' wonder and after</h2>Yet despite these glorious roles, Kemp left the company some time in 1599 to resume a career of solo clowning. He sold his share soon after its purchase, and was a conspicuous absentee from the cast of Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man out of his Humour</span> (late 1599). Possibly he stayed in Shoreditch when the Chamberlain's Men moved to the Globe, for in September the German traveller Thomas Platter saw a clown performing at the Curtain with an unnamed company. His next certain appearance was the famous morris dance from London to Norwich, a 130-mile journey begun on 11 February 1600 and completed a month later. This small-scale but fantastic adventure seems to have combined financial speculation with canny self-advertisement. Travelling with an overseer whose job was to certify he really did dance all the way, Kemp laid money with backers, who promised to return three times the sum should he complete the feat, and gave further small gifts as financial pledges to sympathetic spectators <i>en route</i>. In the pamphlet he wrote to publicize his achievement, <span class="italic">Kemp's Nine Daies Wonder</span> (1600), he described in picaresque detail his encounters along the road, the amusement, companionship, and occasional competition he provoked. He also complained that many who wagered against his reaching Norwich failed to pay up when he returned, and threatened to publish their names in a supplement. None the less, the preface suggests that the journey was sufficiently successful to encourage him to attempt another solo continental tour.<br>
<br>During the ensuing year Kemp made his way into Germany and Italy, eventually arriving at Rome, where he met the English traveller Sir Anthony Shirley, an encounter dramatized in Day, Rowley, and Wilkins's <span class="italic">The Travailes of the Three English Brothers</span>, where the meeting is placed in Venice  (Chambers, 2.326). He may also have been the &#145;Johann Kemp&#146; who in November 1601 was leading an English troupe that had reached Munster by way of Amsterdam and Cologne. But these sparsely documented ventures do not seem to have helped him financially. He was at home in September 1601, complaining of having fallen prey to misfortunes, and in March 1602 he borrowed money from Philip Henslowe, the impresario of Worcester's Men. By this time he had accepted a position with Worcester's Men and was one of their most senior players: he and the dramatist Thomas Heywood were payees for the company's court performance in January 1602. Still, he was probably earning far less from this company than the income he would have received had he remained a sharer at the Globe. Although he had garnered incomparable fame and popular acclaim, the dazzling financial rewards that some contemporary actors acquired largely eluded him.<br>
<br>Why did Kemp leave the Chamberlain's Men? It has frequently been supposed that in 1599 he was the victim of a company coup, for about the time of his departure Chamberlain's recruited a new comedian in Robert Armin. Armin's line was quite different from Kemp's robust athleticism. More witty, musical, and philosophical, he played fools rather than clowns and was less given to improvisation. Not only did Shakespeare reflect Armin's specialisms in the changed character of his subsequent comic parts, but new departures seem to be signalled in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1600). The prince's advice to the players includes severe censure of clowns who &#145;speak more than is set down for them&#146;, intrude laughter into serious passages, and endlessly recycle their &#145;one suit of jests&#146;  (III.i). If, as this suggests, Chamberlain's were trying to move upmarket, Kemp may indeed have felt unwelcome at the new Globe.<br>
<br>Yet the surviving evidence is not clear-cut. Had the Burbages wanted to force Kemp out, they would hardly have offered him a share, as this made him one of the company's most powerful members. For his part, Kemp may not have seen the break as final. At Norwich in 1600 he was still travelling under the title of &#145;the Lord Chamberlain his servant&#146;  (D. Galloway, ed., <span class="italic">Norwich, 1540&#150;1642</span>, 1984, 115), and his pairing with Burbage in the Cambridge <span class="italic">Return from Parnassus</span> perhaps indicates that at some point after returning from Italy he briefly rejoined the Globe company. Still, the tide was against him and the jigs that were his forte. In the next reign a separation started to emerge between the old-style open-air amphitheatres and the much smaller and more exclusive indoor playhouses that were gradually being built. In this new landscape, jigs were increasingly associated with playhouses like the Fortune and the Red Bull, where audiences were overwhelmingly plebeian and the repertoire had failed to move on. In Richard Brome's <span class="italic">The Antipodes</span> (1638), a character directing a play within the play rebukes his clown for disrupting the performance with impromptu jokes. That, he says, was the way:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">of Tarlton and Kemp,<br>
</div>
<div>Before the stage was purged from barbarism<br>
</div>
<div>And brought to the perfection it now shines with.<br>
</div> (Wiles, 35)</blockquote>In the more fashionable and socially segregated theatres of Stuart London, nostalgia for jigs connoted a taste for outmoded and inferior dramatic forms.<br>
<br>Kemp's most important roles with Worcester's Men would have been in Dekker and Webster's <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Wyatt</span> (1602) and Heywood's <span class="italic">A Woman Killed with Kindness</span> (1603). His last certain mention comes in a costume payment in Henslowe's accounts for September 1602. He may or may not have been &#145;Kemp, a man&#146; who was buried at St Saviour's, Southwark, on 2 November 1603. Latterly, though, a reference has surfaced to a gratuity paid to &#145;William Kempe, my Lady Hunsdon's man&#146;, in November 1610  (Duncan-Jones). Lady Hunsdon was the wealthy widow of George Carey, who as Elizabeth's lord chamberlain had been patron to the company in which Kemp and Shakespeare performed in the 1590s. If this payment was to Kemp the actor, it suggests he had returned to his old patronage network, perhaps retiring from the stage and spending his final years as a member of Lady Hunsdon's household.<br>
<br>The possibility that Kemp lived on to about 1610 is strengthened by various early Jacobean allusions to him. The most striking comes in a poem by Sir John Strangways prefacing Thomas Coryat's <span class="italic">Crudities</span> (1611, sig. D1v), which says<blockquote>
<div>Kemp yet doth live, and only lives for this<br>
</div>
<div>Much famous, that he did dance the morris<br>
</div>
<div>From London unto Norwich.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>However, &#145;yet doth live&#146; could mean that he was in fact dead, and remained metaphorically alive in the memory that people still had of his morris. He is also mentioned in Thomas Heywood's <span class="italic">Apology for Actors</span> (1612), though Heywood's wording does not explicitly say that he was alive, and places him in company with other actors whom Heywood positively states were dead. He had certainly died by 1615, for in a lawsuit over shares in the Globe he is described as <i>defunctus</i>  (Wallace). Whether in this putative retirement Kemp made any guest appearance on the public stage, or even acted as himself in <span class="italic">The Travailes of the Three English Brothers</span>, inevitably remains a matter of conjecture.<br>
