<span class="headword">Ripley,  Dorothy</span>  (1767&#150;1831), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 24 April 1767 in Whitby, Yorkshire, the second daughter in the large family of Dorothy and William Ripley (1739&#150;1784), of Whitby. Her father was a master mason and a Methodist minister. Dorothy learned to pray at two or three, and felt chosen to preach the gospel to the heathen from eleven. Her teenage years were turbulent, marked by a suicide attempt in 1783, and in 1784 the death of her beloved father. At about twenty, on her way &#145;to meeting&#146;, she encountered a group of sailors who had just stripped, tarred, and feathered a beautiful girl &#145;ruined by a snare&#146;. Ripley &#145;became servant to this miserable female&#146;, helped her on with borrowed clothes, &#145;lifted up my eyes to Heaven, and asked, Why is this not me Lord?&#146; Later, in her prison visiting, she always sought out prostitutes for kindness.<br>
<br>In 1802, already a minister for ten years, Dorothy Ripley set out to preach to &#145;Ethiopia's children&#146; living under &#145;base tyranny&#146; in &#145;the large cities of America&#146;. Several times she returned home because of illness, but never for long. She maintained links with the Quakers but made a point of religious independence: &#145;As I am not a member of any community, no society can answer for my irregular conduct.&#146; She valued herself on being self-supporting, &#145;enabled to pay my own expenses many times, at Inns, by printing&#146;. At Chester in England in October 1807 she spent two days editing a slim volume of letters addressed to her by several &#145;Africans and Indians&#146;, including a black bishop, proto-feminist Indian women, and a convicted felon.<br>
<br>In New York in 1810 Ripley issued her <span class="italic">Extraordinary conversion, and religious experience &hellip; with her first voyage and travels in America</span>. She stated that this was the first volume and reprinted it in London in 1817, but never produced a second volume. A similar work prepared for the press soon after this one appeared only in 1819, in Philadelphia, as <span class="italic">The Bank of Faith and Works United</span>. That year she also published an account of a nineteen-year-old woman executed for arson. Her memoirs in jaunty verse (including &#145;A Hymn from my Nativity&#146;, written in 1819) and prose (written in late 1821, in Mythe near Tewkesbury) appeared together at Bristol as <span class="italic">An Address to All in Difficulties</span>. A second, revised and expanded edition of <span class="italic">The Bank</span> in 1822 earned her a passage to the southern states of America, her ninth Atlantic crossing. On yet another voyage, from New York to France in 1826, she found time to write a preface to her father's recently discovered memoirs, published in Philadelphia in 1827.<br>
<br>Ripley's texts reflect the contradictions of her career. The language of her faith and preaching was other-worldly, yet she was deeply concerned with social issues and the roots of crime and poverty. She was selfless in religious commitment, yet delighted in displaying herself in print as a spiritual heroine. Dorothy Ripley died on 23 December 1831 in Mecklenburgh, Virginia. She was unmarried.<br>
