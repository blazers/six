<span class="headword">Coldstream,  John</span>  (1806&#150;1863), <span class="occ">physician</span>, only son of Robert Coldstream, merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Phillips, daughter of John Phillips of Stobcross, Glasgow, was born at Leith on 19 March 1806. After attending Edinburgh high school, he continued his studies at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MD in 1827. That year he also took his diploma at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and proceeded to Paris to continue his medical education. In 1829 he settled down as a practitioner in Leith with Dr Charles Anderson, to whom he had been apprenticed when he began his medical studies. Anderson was an eminent practitioner in Leith and one of the founders of the Wernerian Society, of which Coldstream became a member on 9 January 1830.<br>
<br>Coldstream was considered to have been so &#145;devoted to both Christianity and natural science&#146; that &#145;these subjects seem to have engaged his energies more than did medicine&#146;  (Boyd, 522). He took an early interest in <span class="roman">Bible</span> and missionary societies, and in 1822 he wrote the report of the Leith Juvenile Bible Society. For the rest of his life he remained a deeply religious man.<br>
<br>Coldstream also gained a great love of natural history early in his life. On 18 March 1823 he was elected as a member of the Plinian Society, and he acted as secretary and treasurer that same year. He was chosen as one of the society's presidents in 1824 and 1825. In 1828, having become so well known in the field of natural history, he was offered the post of assistant in the Natural History Institution at Portsmouth, which he declined. On 7 May 1835 Coldstream married Margaret Menzies, the youngest daughter of the Revd William Menzies of Lanark. They were to have ten children.<br>
<br>About 1840 the subject of medical missions began to occupy Coldstream's attention. With his friend Benjamin Bell he became associate secretary of the Medical Missionary Society. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1845, but scarcely took any part in its proceedings. In October 1846 he helped to establish at Leith a hospital for the sick poor; however, the following year he moved to York Place, Edinburgh, his weak health making him unable to cope with the workload of his practice at Leith. He was instrumental in the establishment in 1855 of the Home and School for Invalid and Imbecile Children, in Grayfield Square, Edinburgh. He was almost a daily visitor at this home for nearly five years. In September 1857 he went to Berlin to attend the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance in order to bring to its notice the cause of medical missions. During the winter of 1858&#150;9 Coldstream first became ill with an organic disease of the stomach which eventually proved fatal. However, he was well enough to deliver a course of lectures on ethnography in the winter of 1859&#150;60. After this the state of his health obliged him to move about from place to place.<br>
<br>Coldstream was a &#145;complex man with a high intellect and enquiring mind&#146;  (Boyd, 524). He wrote widely on a variety of medical, scientific, and religious subjects, presenting many papers to scholarly meetings and contributing to the transactions of the Plinian Society, the Wernerian Society, the Royal Medical Society, and the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Society, among others. Of his works, &#145;On the periodicity of disease as connected with sol-lunar influences&#146; (1827) and &#145;On a case of catalepsy&#146; (1854), both in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, are of particular interest. Coldstream died at his home, Irthing House, near Carlisle, on 17 September 1863.<br>
