</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Copleston,  Edward</span>  (1776&#150;1849), <span class="occ">bishop of Llandaff and moral philosopher</span>, was born on 2 February 1776 at Offwell in Devon, where his father, John Bradford Copleston, was rector. He was educated at home until the age of fifteen when, in 1791, he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Further meritocratic progress ensued: the chancellor's prize for Latin in 1793, a fellowship (by invitation) at Oriel College in 1795, the English essay prize in 1796, a college tutorship in 1799. He was destined for a traditional career as an Oxford don, albeit an educationally reforming one: he was one of six Oriel fellows who gratuitously conducted the first examinations under the examination statute of 1800. Ordination followed in 1800 and the vicarage of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford, usually held by an Oriel fellow, together with further college and university preferment. He became professor of poetry in 1802, and as senior treasurer of Oriel for six years from 1806 substantially improved the college's finances. His genealogical hobbies led to his election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1804. He never married.<br>
<br>In his thirties Copleston entered a wider public stage. This was principally due to his successful support in 1809 for the candidacy for the office of university chancellor of the pro-Catholic politician Lord Grenville. As a result, not only did he gain prominence in the university (he was elected unopposed provost of Oriel in 1814, succeeding Provost Eveleigh, one of the sponsors of the examination statute) but also entry to the liberal tory political world. He became a frequent visitor to Dropmore, Grenville's country house, and to Althorp, the home of the second Earl Spencer. In the 1820s he was consulted by Robert Peel and William Huskisson on financial questions. It was also in this period that he wrote his most important publications: on education (the <span class="italic">Three Replies to the Calumnies of the Edinburgh Review</span>, 1810&#150;11), economics (the letters to Sir Robert Peel on the currency and pauperism, 1819), and theology (the <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Doctrines of Necessity and Predestination</span>, 1821).<h2>
<a name="AnAnglicanpolemicist"></a>An Anglican polemicist</h2>Copleston's promotion of educational reform, political economy, and Christian apologetics all served an essentially conservative enterprise: to ensure the continued existence of an Anglican ruling &eacute;lite and the dominance of Anglican institutions. Thus his <span class="italic">Three Replies</span> were a defence of Oxford University and a classical education against the charges of the Edinburgh Reviewers (contained in a series of articles by John Playfair, Richard Payne Knight, and Sydney Smith) that the university neglected, to the detriment of the country, the new social sciences as well as the physical sciences. In political economy he was a champion of the gold standard, and attacked the inflationary speculation of the wartime years. He sought to return the economy to the order of nature. In his theological writings he attacked the external threats to Anglican orthodoxy, in particular the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. However, his methods were liberal: he utilized new means for conservative ends.<br>
<br>Copleston recognized that a university education served a national purpose and that the English universities were answerable to public opinion. He was not, therefore, averse to reform in order, as he wrote in the <span class="italic">Three Replies</span>, that &#145;the lifeblood of England&#146; might be &#145;invigorated by healthy food&#146;. Not only did he support the introduction of the new examination statute, as noted above, he also supported the abolition of closed scholarships and fellowships, and developed the tutorial system which made Oriel famous. Through his teaching he sought to develop an Anglican meritocracy. This involved changes to the curriculum; he almost singlehandedly promoted the teaching of logic at Oxford, albeit deductive Aristotelian logic rather than the Baconian inductive reasoning favoured by the Edinburgh Reviewers, as well as reviving the analogical reasoning of Joseph Butler (1692&#150;1752). Although he believed that the Oxford trinity of logic, divinity, and mathematics should exclusively form the basis of a degree, he supported the teaching of the new natural and social sciences outside the colleges by means of university professors. Paradoxically, in view of the attacks of the Edinburgh Reviewers, through his admiration for the work of Dugald Stewart and in particular his <span class="italic">Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind</span>, Copleston introduced the work of the late Scottish Enlightenment to Oxford, and so too, it is generally considered, to the first Oxford political economists: Nassau Senior (1790&#150;1864) and Richard Whately (1787&#150;1863).<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Letters to Robert Peel</span> on the gold standard and the poor laws, Copleston characteristically began with the assertion that it was only by reference to the first principles of the science of political economy that it was possible to sustain an argument about practical measures. By clearing away the undergrowth of false reasoning and by applying the deductive method to a few axiomatic truths it was possible to reach certain conclusions. In this way, despite the existence of the evils of unemployment and poverty, it was possible to see the divinely created order even in the current economic chaos. Thus, he argued, political economy was emphatically not a secular science. In his <span class="italic">First Letter</span> he attributed the economic dislocation of post-Napoleonic war England to the depreciation of the currency, and urged the government to remove such obstacles as it was able to the self-correcting mechanism of nature. In his <span class="italic">Second Letter</span>, although he agreed with the evangelical John Bird Sumner (1780&#150;1862) that economic life was one of the trials of man, and thus that governments should not effect by human laws what God had provided by the laws of nature, he did not concede that misery was the necessary consequence. He argued that it was possible to provide by law for the preservation, but not the propagation, of life. He thus tempered the apparent &#145;evil&#146; of Malthus's natural check to population growth. The object of the poor laws was not radically inconsistent with the principle of population where it embodied the Christian duty of charity but did not usurp the natural order by encouraging population growth. Moreover, as the state of society improved, so would the standard of poor relief. However, Copleston's liberality in the face of demands for the abolition of poor-law relief should not be exaggerated: he opposed public works programmes and the purchase of land for cultivation by the poor, and approved of checks being imposed on the administration of relief by justices of the peace. The purpose of his support for relief was better to punish vagrancy and mendicity.<h2>
<a name="Theologicalandphilosophicalwritings"></a>Theological and philosophical writings</h2>In theological matters Copleston applied the principles of natural theology to the interpretation of revealed religion in order to demonstrate the reasonableness of revelation. He argued, invoking the aid of the eighteenth-century Bishop Butler, that if the difficulties of revealed religion were no greater than those of nature, and the divine creation of the latter were acknowledged, those difficulties should not be regarded as objections to the credibility of revelation but as evidence of its truth. Thus in his <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Doctrines of Necessity and Predestination</span> (1821) he argued that just as in the natural world free will is compatible with divine order, by analogy in the revealed world the existence of divine foreknowledge is compatible with man's exercise of choice and the punishments and rewards which God administers as a result. The Calvinist error in construing the biblical passages on divine foreknowledge as evidence of predestination was, according to Copleston, to place too human a construction on them. The Calvinist forgot that God's attributes are described imperfectly, in human terms only, since it is impossible for man to know the true nature of the divine. Indeed this was not the purpose of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#151;which was to teach man how to feel and act towards God, not to explain his nature. However, by restoring &#145;the pure substance of the Gospel&#146; in this way, Copleston arguably diminished its strength in the long run by opening it to the critical scrutiny of the natural sciences.<br>
<br>Copleston's writings were chiefly ephemeral in nature and do not reflect his breadth of interests nor do justice to his importance in the intellectual life of the country. His principal intellectual legacy, in the best Oxford tradition, was his students, who wrote the substantial works which his occasional pieces anticipated. Copleston was the leader of the early Noetic school at Oxford, centred around Oriel College, and so called from the Greek <i>noesis</i>, meaning reason [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45620/', "Noetics")</script>]. This school was responsible to a large degree both for the intellectual revival of the university and a distinctive Anglican apologetic which, in the 1820s, combined a &#145;high&#146; view of the church, as an externally visible, divinely appointed society, with a rational defence of the Christian creed. His main disciple was Richard Whately (1787&#150;1863), fellow of Oriel and archbishop of Dublin. His books on logic and rhetoric in particular owed much to Copleston, who at one stage had contemplated writing a treatise on logic and who, in his pamphlet published in 1809, <span class="italic">The Examiner Examined, or, Logic Vindicated</span>, a review of Henry Kett's <span class="italic">Logic Made Easy</span> (1809), had declared that logic was &#145;the guide for Reason&#146;. Whately also wrote an introductory treatise on political economy which Copleston was equipped, but failed, to provide. Another student was Baden Powell (1796&#150;1860), also a fellow of Oriel, whom he recommended for the Savilian chair of geometry. His controversial views on the non-divinely ordained nature of the sabbath (also shared with Whately) Copleston foreshadowed in a book review of William Buckland's <span class="italic">Reliquiae diluvianae</span> (1823). Renn Dickson Hampden (1793&#150;1868), fellow of Oriel, regius professor of divinity, and bishop of Hereford, was a third pupil, whose Bampton lectures for 1833 continued Copleston's revival at Oxford of the works of Bishop Joseph Butler.<br>
<br>At the height of his Oxford dominance Copleston is said to have been of august and commanding presence: he was physically fit, a noted equestrian, and tireless walker (he once walked all the way from Oxford to Offwell). He had the air and polish of a man of fashion, rather than of a university don, as befitted a member of the Alfred, a London club much patronized by senior clergy and superior lawyers, and a guest of society drawing-rooms. His sonorous voice was much imitated by undergraduates. He was also capable of rudeness and irritation when his quickness of mind was not followed by others. Above all, he was noted for his precision of thought, a characteristic trait of the Oriel common room at that time, which attributed much intellectual error to incorrect definitions and loose reasoning.<h2>
<a name="BishopofLlandaff"></a>Bishop of Llandaff</h2>With such talents and connections, it is perhaps surprising that Copleston did not achieve greater ecclesiastical preferment. He became dean of Chester in 1826, and in 1827 dean of St Paul's and bishop of Llandaff, one of the poorest sees, with no episcopal residence and a net income in 1828 of only &pound;924; he resigned the provostship of Oriel in January 1828. Part of the explanation may be that in the 1820s he was caught in the cross-fire between the Canningites (with whom he was associated and whom he praised in his publications) and the ultra-tories, with the result that he was passed over for the see of Oxford in 1826 which instead went to Peel's candidate and former tutor, Charles Lloyd. It may also have been the result of his anti-sabbatarian views, with which William Howley, then bishop of London and subsequently archbishop of Canterbury, who was consulted by the king on the Oxford bishopric, was not in sympathy. From the 1820s onwards he also began to suffer from the depression which in his later years is said to have clouded his intellect.<br>
<br>As bishop of Llandaff, Copleston participated in the conference at Lambeth which determined the form of declaration which was to replace the sacramental test abolished by the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> in 1828. He also amended the declaration in the House of Lords by inserting the words &#145;upon the faith of a Christian&#146;, turning it into a religious test designed to exclude non-Christians from office and provoking the protests of the whigs Lord Holland and Henry Brougham. He supported Catholic emancipation in 1829, but this, however, was the limit of his liberalism. Although much consulted by the whig governments of the 1830s on ecclesiastical appointments, he was never truly in sympathy with their politics. He voted against the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> on its second reading in the Lords in October 1831, although he subsequently changed his mind; he opposed the abolition of church rates in the 1830s, and was not in favour of substituting a payment out of the consolidated fund; he disapproved of non-denominational Christian education; he opposed repeal of the corn laws and the <span class="roman">Jew Declaration Bill</span>, and voted against the increase in the grant to Maynooth College in 1845. His friend and former pupil, Richard Whately, was right to term him in the context of post-Reform politics &#145;a most decided tory&#146;.<br>
<br>Copleston's diocese, which had been predominantly rural, had a rapidly expanding population due to the development of the south Wales coalfields and the coal ports of Newport and, subsequently, Cardiff. In response he encouraged the construction of both parsonage houses, to encourage a resident clergy, and churches. Between 1827 and 1853 the number of cures without a resident minister fell by approximately 60 per cent. He also promoted parochial schools and reformed the administrative structure of the diocese: a deanery was created in 1840 and a second archdeacon appointed in 1844. On average he personally expended in occasional donations and subscriptions connected with his diocese, both public and private, sums greater than his annual episcopal income. Such activities, however, were unequal to the task of stemming the growth of Welsh dissent. Nor did they exempt him from the charge that, by failing to present Welsh speakers to Wesh benefices, he had weakened the church. However, as much of the population growth was due to English immigration, and as he only had twelve livings in his personal gift, such a failure (denied by his biographer), if true, can scarcely have had the consequence alleged.<br>
<br>Copleston's theological and economic views in the 1840s were unaltered from those he expressed in the 1820s. He opposed the &#145;mysticism&#146; of the Tractarians and their opposition to science and literature. He saw the Irish famine of 1846 as a providential message of the truth of Malthusianism. In his later years he became increasingly irritable and oversensitive as his health deteriorated: he gave up horse-riding in 1844. Copleston died on Sunday 14 October 1849 at Hardwick House, near Chepstow, and was buried on 23 October in the lady chapel of Llandaff Cathedral, the first bishop to be buried there since 1674.<br>
<br>Copleston's life exemplified the transitional position which he occupied in early nineteenth-century England. By comparison with many of his contemporaries he was a liberal reformer, promoting both the revival of learning and liberal politics at Oxford. But he chose not to pursue the consequences of the liberal speculations which he encouraged in his pupils. He had no desire to see either the natural or social sciences displace classical learning at Oxford, nor reason undermine Anglican doctrinal truth. He wished only for a revivified English establishment, which, instead of retreating into reaction, was capable of fighting new heresies on their own territory. This, however, was a task principally undertaken by his students.<br>
