<span class="headword">Bunbury, Sir  (Thomas) Charles</span>, sixth baronet  (1740&#150;1821), <span class="occ">horse-racing administrator and politician</span>, was born in Suffolk (probably at Mildenhall) in May 1740, the elder son of the Revd Sir William Bunbury, fifth baronet (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1764), and his wife, Eleanor Graham (<i>d</i>. 1762), daughter of Vere Graham of Wix Abbey, Essex; his brother was the caricaturist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3937/', "Henry William Bunbury")</script>. The family had been prominent landowners in Cheshire for several centuries and his father, the vicar of Mildenhall, inherited estates in Suffolk also. He was educated at a school in Bury St Edmunds, at Westminster School, London, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, from where he matriculated in 1757 and graduated MA in 1765. He travelled to France and Italy on the grand tour in 1760&#150;61.<br>
<br>Bunbury entered parliament as MP for Suffolk at the general election in 1761 and held his seat until 1812, apart from a break from 1784 to 1790. He held briefly the post of secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Weymouth, from May to July 1765. He was a whig and later a supporter of Charles James Fox. Fox was a nephew of his first wife, Lady Sarah Lennox (1745&#150;1826) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48897/', "Napier, Lady Sarah")</script>], whom he married on 2 June 1762. She was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16450/', "Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond and Lennox (1701&#150;1750)")</script>, courtier, and Lady Sarah Cadogan (<i>d</i>. 1751). Lady Sarah, whose beauty had attracted the young George III, was unsuited to life with a good-natured but neglectful sporting gentleman who preferred the company of grooms and jockeys. She had several affairs and the daughter she gave birth to during the marriage was not her husband's but Lord William Gordon's. The union was dissolved by act of parliament on 14 May 1776.<br>
<br>Bunbury's main interest was horse racing and he regularly attended meetings at Newmarket, which was near his country seat at Barton Hall, Great Barton, Suffolk. He was co-founder of the Oaks (1779) as well as of the Derby. The story goes that he lost the toss of a coin with the earl of Derby for the privilege of having a new race at Epsom named after him. Ironically he won the first running of the Derby with his colt Diomed in 1780, and he owned two more winners of the race, Eleanor and Smolensko. He also bred Highflyer, the greatest stallion of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Bunbury was steward of the Jockey Club for the first time at the age of twenty-eight and for many years he ruled racing even when not in office. At first the club had authority only at Newmarket, but under his leadership it became the governing body of the turf throughout the country. He transformed the pattern of racing and helped to create the modern thoroughbred by replacing 4 mile heats with races that demanded greater speed and precocity. His determination to eradicate sharp practice in racing was shown in 1791 when he took action over the inconsistent running of Escape, a horse owned by the prince of Wales, who subsequently withdrew from racing at Newmarket.<br>
<br>Bunbury was a mild, kindly man but decisive in promoting the interests of the sport he loved. Little is known of his second wife, Margaret (1744?&#150;1822), except that she was of humble origins and little education. He died at his London house in Pall Mall on 31 March 1821 and was buried in the family vault at Mildenhall ten days later, on 10 April. His widow died on 6 February 1822. He had no children and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3936/', "Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Bunbury (1778&#150;1860)")</script>.<br>
