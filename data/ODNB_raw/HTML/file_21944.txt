</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Hugh</span>, second duke of Northumberland  (1742&#150;1817), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born in the parish of St George's, Hanover Square, London, on 14 August 1742. He was the eldest son of Sir Hugh Smithson (<i>bap</i>. 1712, <i>d</i>. 1786) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21943/', "Percy, Hugh, first duke of Northumberland")</script>] and Lady Elizabeth Smithson (1716&#150;1776) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59609/', "Percy, Elizabeth")</script>], who in April 1750 adopted the name Percy in place of Smithson on Sir Hugh's inheriting the title of earl of Northumberland from his wife's father, Algernon Seymour, seventh duke of Somerset. From 1750 until his father became first duke of Northumberland in October 1766, Hugh Percy was styled Lord Warkworth. Thereafter, until he inherited his father's dukedom, he was generally known as Lord or Earl Percy.<br>
<br>Percy was educated at Eton College from 1753 to 1758, and then at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1760. On 1 May 1759, not yet aged seventeen, he was gazetted ensign in the 24th foot; four months later he exchanged to the 85th with the rank of captain. He may have served at the battle of Minden as a volunteer, and in 1762 he became lieutenant-colonel of the newly raised 111th foot and received a commission as a lieutenant-colonel in the Grenadier Guards.<br>
<br>In 1763 and again at the 1768 general election, Percy was elected, unopposed, an MP for Westminster. In the Commons he supported the Grenville ministry, and in February 1766 he voted against the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. He aligned himself with the Chatham administration, and in December 1768 became colonel of the 5th foot. In 1770 Percy and his father went into opposition to the new ministry led by Lord North. Nevertheless, George III threw his electoral weight behind Percy and Lord Thomas Clinton in the 1774 general election, mainly because the alternative candidates for Westminster were Wilkite radicals of whom the king disapproved still more. The decisive factors in Percy's victory, however, were probably the local influence of his father and the direct involvement of his mother, who, according to Walpole  (Walpole, 428), &#145;Sat daily at a window in Covent Garden making interest for her son&#146;.<br>
<br>Percy himself took no part in the election campaign; he had departed with his regiment in May 1774 for service in North America. He watched with increasing dismay as the situation deteriorated in New England: &#145;this Country&#146;, he told his father on 12 September, &#145;is now in as open state of Rebellion as Scotland was in the year 45&#146;  (Percy papers, vol. L, pt A, fol. 16). When at length hostilities began at Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775 Percy played a crucial role in saving Lieutenant-Colonel Smith's force from destruction as it retreated to Boston. Percy's brigade, together with two field pieces, met Smith's beleaguered column on the road between Menotomy and Lexington. Percy's troops held the enraged Massachusetts militiamen at bay while Smith's men regrouped, and then escorted Smith's battered command back to Boston under heavy fire. His coolness was widely praised, and he became the hero of the hour in besieged Boston. In July 1775 he was appointed major-general in America, and in September major-general in the army.<br>
<br>In 1776 Percy was involved in the campaign in and around New York. After the British victory on Long Island (27 August 1776) he wrote that the Americans &#145;will never again stand before us in the Field. Things seem to be over with Them &amp; I flatter myself now that this Campaign will put a total End to the War&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 69)&#151;a misjudgement, but one shared by many of his colleagues. He took part in the storming of Fort Washington on 16 November 1776, and at the beginning of December he went with General Clinton on the expedition to occupy Newport, Rhode Island. In January 1777 Clinton left Rhode Island for England, leaving Percy in charge of the garrison.<br>
<br>Over the next few weeks Percy's relationship with General Sir William Howe (1729&#150;1814), the British commander-in-chief in America, rapidly deteriorated. Percy complained at Howe's decision to reduce the number of troops under his command in order to reinforce the army operating in New Jersey. He was further aggrieved when Howe pressed him to send a large quantity of forage to New York, which Percy believed could not be spared. When Howe criticized a civil appointment that Percy had made on Rhode Island, then reversed the decision of a court martial over which Percy had presided, and finally implied that he should have taken Providence as well as Newport in the preceding December, Percy decided that he would not allow himself to be &#145;subject to another such indignity&#146;  (Willcox, 127&#150;8). Howe, for his part, regarded Percy as over-sensitive and too status-conscious: &#145;he thinks I have not treated him according to his rank as an Offr. &amp; <i>Heir apparent</i> to ye Dukedom of Northumberland&#146;  (Howe to General James Grant, 18 March 1777, Macpherson Grant papers, bundle 252). Percy returned to England on 5 May, his departure lamented by both the army and the civilian population of Rhode Island, where his humanity and concern for the inhabitants earned him much popularity. Ostensibly, he left America to inherit the Percy barony from his mother, but the real reason for his return home was soon widely known.<br>
<br>Back in England, Percy was promoted in August 1777 lieutenant-general, but he played no further active part in military operations during the American war. In November 1784 he was appointed colonel of the second troop of Horse Grenadier Guards. He inherited his father's dukedom in June 1786, and was lord lieutenant and vice-admiral of Northumberland in 1786&#150;99 and 1802&#150;17. He was promoted general in October 1793, and was colonel of the Royal Horse Guards from December 1806 to 1812.<br>
<br>Percy married on 2 July 1764 Lady Anne Stuart (<i>b</i>. 1746), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792)")</script>; they had no children. The fashionable <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> of London alleged in 1772 that Percy was virtually impotent from masturbation at school and frequenting brothels in his youth, and that his wife was a &#145;notoriously promiscuous adulteress&#146;  (Stone, 258). He divorced her by act of parliament (16 March 1779) for criminal conversation with William Bird of Trinity College, Cambridge. Percy then married on 25 May 1779 his sister-in-law Frances Julia (1752&#150;1820), third daughter of Peter Burrell of Langley Park, Beckenham, Kent; they had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21924/', "Algernon Percy")</script>, and two daughters. He was one of the richest men in England, his wealth increased by mines in Northumberland. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary his annual income was estimated at not less than &pound;80,000. He was extravagant and generous. He paid fares home for widows of men of his regiment killed in America. After 1815 when agricultural prices fell he reduced his rents by a quarter; his grateful tenants erected a memorial column in 1816.<br>
<br>In politics, although at first an admirer of Pitt, Percy veered towards the opposition, was a leader of the &#145;armed neutrality&#146;, during the 1789 regency crisis, and subsequently joined the prince of Wales's circle. When in 1797 he was approached by Lord Moira with a view to reviving the &#145;armed neutrality&#146;, he eventually withheld support, remarking that no ministry could last two whole sessions of parliament against both Pitt and Fox. In 1803 he declined joining on attack on Addington, on the grounds that it would make room for Pitt, whose principles he detested. That year, on the resumption of war with France, he resigned the lord lieutenancy of Northumberland in protest at the military arrangements then put in place. Nevertheless, in view of the threatened invasion he raised at his own expense a volunteer unit from his tenantry. He was also dissatisfied with the 1806 coalition of the Foxite whigs with his hated cousin Lord Grenville. Complaining he had not been consulted, he initially instructed his parliamentary interest (principally his Cornish boroughs) to withhold support from the ministry of all the talents. It took the prince of Wales's intervention to secure Percy's reconciliation with Fox. Percy was a competent soldier but very mediocre politician: his family pride militated against success in either field.<br>
<br>Percy died of rheumatic gout at Northumberland House, Strand, London, on 10 July 1817 and was buried on 19 July 1817 in the family vault (built in 1776 for his mother) in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21945/', "Hugh Percy (1785&#150;1847)")</script>.<br>
