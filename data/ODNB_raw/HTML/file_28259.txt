<span class="headword">Vesey, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (1672/3&#150;1730), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory</span>, was born at Cork, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28258/', "John Vesey (1638&#150;1716)")</script>, successively dean of Cork, bishop of Limerick, and archbishop of Tuam, and his wife, Rebecca Wilson. His education began in Cork, was said to have continued at Eton College, and brought him to Christ Church, Oxford, whence he matriculated in July 1689, aged sixteen. The family fortunes having been depleted by the Jacobite revanche in Ireland, he was helped through university by the future archbishop William Wake. He graduated BA in 1693 and two years later became a fellow of Oriel College. His father was already regarded as a notable nepotist and the fortunes of the family were further improved by Thomas Vesey's marriage, on 27 July 1698, to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1746), the only surviving daughter and heir of Denny Muschamp, muster-master-general of Ireland, and Elizabeth, daughter of Michael Boyle, the long-lived archbishop of Armagh; Vesey's stepmother had also been a Muschamp. Following this access of wealth Vesey was made a baronet on 28 September 1698. Also, in common with two of his half-brothers, he took holy orders, being ordained priest on 24 June 1700. His father immediately appointed him to the archdeaconry of Tuam, which he held in conjunction with two livings in the same diocese and the rectory of Drumcree in the diocese of Armagh. In 1703 the new lord lieutenant, the duke of Ormond, made him a chaplain, whereupon he resigned the archdeaconry. Ormond's patronage suggested tory leanings; these, together with assiduous courtship of the important in London, helped Vesey to the bishopric of Killaloe, where he was consecrated on 12 July 1713. In the following year, on 18 February 1714, he was translated to Ossory&#151;convenient for Ormond's bailiwick of Kilkenny and for the bishop's recently acquired estate at Abbey Leix, Queen's county. Vesey and his wife devoted much energy and money to embellishing both house and grounds. They also spent long periods in London and at Bath.<br>
<br>George I's accession greatly diminished Vesey's influence and obliged him to be more circumspect in voicing his political opinions. He was still identified with the once powerful tory interest in Ireland. Despite the changed political climate he continued to appear at the Lords' sittings, particularly in 1719 and 1723&#150;4, as one in a sizeable group of bishops who survived from Queen Anne's reign. Like his father he appointed close relatives to the more valuable livings within his diocese. His notoriety in this respect led to his being accused of ordaining &#145;debauchees and troopers&#146; and incurred the disapproval of his superior, the more exacting Archbishop King of Dublin  (Hunt. L., MS 143198&#150;259, fol. 28; quoted in Pilkington, 2.372). Despite Vesey's laxity and worldly preoccupations, standards of residence, educational provision, and regularity of services improved under his episcopate. One contemporary regarded him as &#145;a well-bred gentleman as well as a good bishop&#146;  (<span class="italic">Whole Works of Sir James Ware</span>, 1.599). He died in Dublin on 6 August 1730 and was buried in St Anne's Church. His eldest son, Sir John Denny Vesey, inherited and further improved the Abbey Leix seat and was created Baron Knapton in 1750. His second daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28257/', "Elizabeth Vesey")</script>, married her cousin Agmondesham Vesey and became a celebrated literary hostess.<br>
