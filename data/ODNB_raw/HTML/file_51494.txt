<span class="headword">Bolton,  John Gatenby</span>  (1922&#150;1993), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 5 June 1922 at 3 Clarkehouse Road, Broomhall, Sheffield, Yorkshire, the elder of two children of John Gatenby Bolton (<i>d</i>. 1952), schoolmaster, of Skelton, Cleveland, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kettlewell (<i>d</i>. 1942), schoolteacher of Goole, Yorkshire. He was educated at King Edward VII School, Sheffield, from which he won a state scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1940. The exigencies of war led to a shortened course and in 1942 he was awarded the degree of BA with honours in physics.<br>
<br>In 1942 he obtained a reserve commission in the Royal Navy and after a short course in electronics and radar he was sent to the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern, Worcestershire, to assist in the installation in naval fighter aircraft of the 1&frac12; metre air interception radar already developed for the Royal Air Force night fighters. After D-day he was appointed radio officer to HMS <i>Unicorn</i> of the East Indies fleet. At the end of the war in Sydney he was seconded to the Royal Australian Navy and then to the army, who demobilized him. He remained in Australia for the greater part of the remainder of his life, marrying, in 1948, Letty, daughter of Edward and Ruby Pearl Burke, of Mandurama, New South Wales, and widow of E. T. Leslie, a navigator in Coastal Command who had been killed in action during the Second World War. There were two sons of her first marriage, Brian and Peter, whom Bolton adopted.<br>
<br>In the light of his qualifications, Bolton was advised to meet E. G. Bowen, one of the pioneers in the development of radar in England, who had joined the radiophysics laboratory of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (later the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)) in Sydney in 1944. When Bolton joined the radiophysics division in 1946 Bowen was abroad and J. L. Pawsey was in charge. It was this circumstance that determined Bolton's subsequent research on the radio waves arriving on earth from outer space&#151;a subject soon to be known as radio astronomy. Pawsey's interest was in the recently discovered emission of intense bursts of radio waves by the sun. In February 1942 J. S. Hey of the Army Operational Research Group had discovered, during a secret investigation of the enemy jamming of British radars, that bursts of radio waves were emitted by sunspots and solar flares. It was this phenomenon that Bolton was asked to investigate. He built the appropriate metre wave radio receiver and installed it at Dover Heights, an ex-wartime station near a cliff edge. He did not observe any radio bursts from the sun and decided to direct his aerials over the sea in the hope of observing the radio waves emanating from the Milky Way. When Pawsey discovered this he ordered Bolton to return to the radiophysics laboratory and so this initial excursion to Dover Heights ended. At that stage Bolton joined Gordon Stanley and built equipment to observe the solar radio emission during an eclipse in Brazil, but the equipment was not ready before the last ship, which Pawsey had intended to take to Brazil, had sailed.<br>
<br>This misfortune led to one of the historic events in astronomy. Instructed by Pawsey to find some other use for this radio equipment, in March 1947 Bolton and Stanley returned to Dover Heights and soon they observed the radio emission from a giant sunspot on three widely separated radio frequencies. Their interpretation of these observations formed the subject of their first scientific publication. It was soon realized that on this cliff site, radio waves from the sun or other object reached the aerial through two paths, one direct and the other after reflection from the surface of the sea. From the interference pattern so generated it was possible to locate the source of the emission (in one dimension) to an accuracy of a few minutes of arc. This was the radio analogue of the Lloyd's mirror interferometer in optics.<br>
<br>Bolton and Stanley then searched for sources of extraterrestrial radio emission. In his survey of the extragalactic radio emission J. S. Hey had discovered a localized source of emission in the constellation of Cygnus. He observed that the intensity was fluctuating and concluded that the source of the emission must have small angular dimensions. Bolton and Stanley found that, as this source in Cygnus rose, the chart records of the intensity of the emission showed a maximum and minimum (a fringe pattern) from which it was possible to set an upper limit to the angular size of 8 minutes of arc. The variation in intensity observed by Hey was subsequently discovered to be a consequence of the passage of the radio waves through the earth's ionosphere and was not inherent to the source. By chance Hey had reached the right conclusion for the wrong reason.<br>
<br>Three other extragalactic radio sources of small angular diameter were discovered. There was no obvious optical identification and in order to make possible a search with the large optical telescopes a more precise position for the radio sources had to be determined. Bolton and Stanley moved their interferometer to New Zealand, and by measurements from a number of appropriate cliff sites they were able to place close enough limits on the position of these radio sources to facilitate a search for the optical counterparts by the large American telescopes. These searches with the 200 inch Palomar telescope, particularly by Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski, revealed that one of the radio sources was the supernova remnant of the Crab nebula in the Milky Way. The other two, in Virgo and Centaurus, were shown to be objects of large red shift, that is extragalactic, soon to be accepted as typical of a new class of objects to be known as radio galaxies. Thereby began the radio study of the universe and the mapping of many radio galaxies&#151;faint optically but emitting radio waves of an intensity observable by the relatively crude radio equipment of that epoch.<br>
<br>By 1953 the system at Dover Heights could no longer compete with superior equipment evolving elsewhere for the radio studies of the universe. Pawsey would not agree with Bolton's plans for the future development of his own group, and that prompted Bowen (then head of the radiophysics division) in August 1953 to persuade Bolton to join his cloud physics research. For eighteen months Bolton worked on cloud physics, then in January 1955 took leave of absence from CSIRO to initiate research in radio studies of the universe at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he was appointed a senior research fellow. In 1956 he was appointed professor of radio astronomy at Caltech and resigned his position with CSIRO.<br>
<br>Bolton spent six years at Caltech, during which he created the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. He built an interferometer consisting of two 90 foot diameter steerable paraboloids, on railway tracks so that they could be separated up to 1600 feet either in a north&#150;south or east&#150;west direction. The system, operated at higher radio frequencies than previously, and the location of radio galaxies and their identification using the large optical telescopes, flourished. This equipment measured the accurate right ascension of the radio source known as 3C48, interest in which had been stimulated by the angular diameter measurements at Jodrell Bank, which implied that it could be the most distant object yet known. The subsequent search by the 200 inch Palomar telescope revealed a hitherto unknown type of blue object without a measurable red shift. This result, first presented at the December 1960 meeting of the American Astronomical Society, was the first step towards the conclusion, two years later, that a hitherto unknown class of distant galaxies had been discovered&#151;soon to be known as quasars.<br>
<br>During Bolton's stay at Caltech, Bowen had begun the construction of the 210 foot diameter steerable radio telescope at Parkes, New South Wales. Late in 1960 Bolton left Caltech to supervise the final stages in the construction of this telescope. The Parkes telescope was commissioned in late 1961, and Bolton became the director of this Australian national radio observatory. Under his direction the telescope had widespread use in many radio astronomical researches. His own major interest remained in the discovery and identification of the extragalactic radio sources, and the Parkes catalogue soon extended to many thousands of these sources. In particular he was involved with Cyril Hazard in the precise measurement of the position of the source known as 3C273, by means of lunar occultation. This led to the conclusive discovery that, like 3C48, this was one of the new class of nebulae (quasars) with very high red shifts and hence at great distances in the universe. The catalogue of some 8000 radio sources assembled under Bolton's direction, and the search for the optical identifications, remained his primary interest. With his Australian and American collaborators he found identifications for about 1000 radio sources; this work was published in more than forty papers from 1965 to 1982, and through it he gained considerable experience with the large American optical telescopes. This led to his association with the planning and commissioning of the 4 metre Anglo-Australian optical telescope at Siding Springs.<br>
<br>Bolton was involved on a number of occasions with the NASA space programmes; the signals from Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon in 1969 came via the Parkes telescope, as did the transmissions during the drama of the endangered Apollo 13 mission. He retired as director of the Parkes telescope during the changes of 1971&#150;2, when Bowen retired as chief of the radiophysics division, but he continued to work at Parkes and elsewhere as astronomer-at-large. In 1979 he suffered a severe heart attack but recovered sufficiently to continue the analysis with his colleagues of the Parkes data. In 1981 he retired to Buderim, a coastal resort in Queensland.<br>
<br>Bolton was a keen sportsman; an avid cricketer, he also enjoyed competitive games of golf, table tennis, and billiards. He received many honours and awards, being appointed CBE in 1982. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1973 and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Sciences in 1969. In 1977 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and in 1988 the Bruce medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He died at his home in Buderim after a final attack of pneumonia, following persistent heart trouble, on 6 July 1993. He was survived by his wife.<br>
