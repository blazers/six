<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walwyn,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1600, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">Leveller and medical practitioner</span>, was baptized on 17 August 1600 at Newland, Worcestershire. He was the second son of Robert Walwyn (<i>d</i>. in or before 1616) of Newland, a landed gentleman, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1659), daughter of Herbert Westphaling, bishop of Hereford, and Anne, daughter of William Barlow, bishop of Chichester. Robert Walwyn was a man of &#145;Repute in his Country, and of between three and four hundred pounds Annual Estate&#146;  (H. Brooke, <span class="italic">Charity of Church-Men</span>, 1649, 10).<h2>
<a name="Educationandmarriage"></a>Education and marriage</h2>William's formal education was entrusted to tutors of whom he had a poor opinion. He knew no language other than English and declared that he would have learned Latin &#145;but for the tediousnesse, and impertinancy of my teachers&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 1649, 9). Although Walwyn regretted his lack of Latin he deplored learning &#145;which puffeth up, and makes men scornfull pedants&#146;  (ibid., 9). For his own moral breeding Walwyn honoured his parents, &#145;to whose exemplary virtue I owe more, then for my being&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Fountain of Slaunder</span>, 1649, 1).<br>
<br>In 1619 Walwyn was bound apprentice to a London silk merchant. For seven years he lived with his master in Paternoster Row, during which he was trained as a weaver. Released from his articles, on 17 April 1627 he married Anne, daughter of William Gundell, a chandler in the London parish of St James Garlickhythe. The Walwyns lived in the parish until 1643, remaining in the Thames Street house of Anne's father for at least six years. The parish register records many baptisms and burials of sons and daughters. In separated and revealing statements Walwyn wrote: &#145;I have been married 21 years and have had almost 20 Children&#146;; nine pages later he states that in all the years he and his wife have lived together, &#145;I cannot say she enjoyed a week together in good health&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Fountain of Slaunder</span>, 2, 11). The parish register records that soon after his marriage Walwyn became a master weaver, that he was a vestryman in the church, and that by August 1632 he was a merchant and member of the Merchant Adventurers' Company. In 1643 the Walwyns moved to Moorfields, north of the City wall, where Walwyn maintained his family &#145;in a middle and moderate but contentful condition&#146;  (Brooke, <span class="italic">Charity of Church-Men</span>, 11). Humphrey Brooke, Walwyn's son-in-law, who lived with the family for eight years, wrote with admiration of Walwyn's gentle kindness, describing a loving marriage and family. &#145;The most of my recreation&#146;, said Walwyn, &#145;being a good Book, or an honest and discoursing Friend&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Fountain of Slaunder</span>, 22).<br>
<br>Wide reading enlarged Walwyn's concerns and convictions. He studied theologians, classical works, and humane writers, particularly Montaigne, whose inclusive tolerance enduringly attracted Walwyn. He considered the <span class="roman">Bible</span> &#145;the Book of Books&#146;  (Brooke, <span class="italic">Charity of Church-Men</span>, 5), and his principal guide was the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. Walwyn acknowledged that his critical judgement developed slowly. In his first signed tract he recalled his long inability to judge without the approbation of authors and teachers he admired. The scriptures, &#145;taken in singly, and void of glosse&#146; came to his assistance  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Whisper in the Eare</span>, 1646, 3), and liberated by &#145;that pearle in the field, free justification by Christ alone; I became master of what I heard, or read&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 10).<h2>
<a name="Religiousandpoliticalliberty"></a>Religious and political liberty</h2>Walwyn's conversion from the predestinarian doctrine of Calvinism to belief in free grace, accepting love, and inner peace led to his commitment to unlimited religious freedom. He observed the beliefs and practices of various sectaries and concluded that religious diversity was inevitable: as long as knowledge was imperfect, &#145;men must differ&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Parable</span>, 1646, 4).<br>
<br>Religious conviction, Walwyn believed, was reached in two ways: reason and divine revelation. Jesus and his apostles used &#145;no meanes but argument and perswasion to alter or controle&#146; the views of the Sadducees  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Good Counsell to All</span>, 1644, 86). At the same time Walwyn recognized the limits of reason. That there was a God or that the scriptures were the word of God, &#145;I have not believed them so to be, by force of any argument I have either heard or read&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Still and Soft Voice</span>, 1647, 12). These truths were disclosed by God's revelation. Whether attained by revelation or reason, religious convictions were to be respected and accepted. It was the greatest of sins, Walwyn contended, to compel a man to profess beliefs of which he was not persuaded: to &#145;beleive as the Synod would have us &hellip; [is to] become, as said an honest man, not the Disciples of Christ, but of the Synod&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">The Compassionate Samaritane</span>, 2nd edn, 1644, 42&#150;3).<br>
<br>Walwyn's advocacy of religious liberty was rooted in his belief that it was the way of Jesus. No injunction was ever &#145;given by Christ or his Apostles for the extirpation of the Romans or any others that denyed our God&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Demurre to the Bill</span>, 1646, 4). Between 1641 and January 1646 Walwyn published seven anonymous tracts that contended for inclusive liberty of conscience and particularly urged toleration of sectaries. The tracts indicate that the writer was not a sectary but spoke on behalf of &#145;harmlesse people&#146; whose proponent he became &#145;after much inquiry and examination of their Tenets, and practice&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">The Compassionate Samaritane</span>, 2nd edn, 64&#150;5). No bounds could be set to toleration, not even to one &#145;whose mind is so mis-informed as to deny a Deity&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Toleration Justified</span>, 1646, 9). Walwyn's early appeals for unrestricted toleration were &#145;very hazardable&#146;  (Brooke, <span class="italic">Charity of Church-Men</span>, 11), provoking widespread fear and opposition. It is understandable that they were published anonymously.<br>
<br>Walwyn's political convictions, like his commitment to religious liberty, were inspired by his belief that love was the heart of true religion and that it was possible to serve God only by loving and serving our neighbours. &#145;I am one&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that do truly and heartily love all mankind &hellip; it is from this disposition in me, that I have engaged my self in publick affairs, and from no other&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Whisper in the Eare</span>, 2, 3). With the outbreak of civil war Walwyn found his political cause. In November 1642, three months after the war began, he was appointed the Vintry ward member of a committee to collect assessments to support the war. His second tract, published the same month, carried a political message as well as a plea for toleration. Avowedly written to expose &#145;cunning adversaries&#146; who wished to divide good men religiously, with equal vigour the tract assailed those who would &#145;take away our courages and dull our resolutions by commending peace&#146; which was of no value if unaccompanied by &#145;liberty which we may now if we will our selves obtaine&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Some Considerations</span>, 1642, 4, 13&#150;14).<br>
<br>Throughout the first civil war Walwyn was involved with sectaries and political radicals at Salters' Hall, in London, and he encountered John Lilburne on 19 July 1645 when Walwyn and a deputation came from the hall to accuse Speaker Lenthall of correspondence with royalists and the king. Lilburne, as often, was at Westminster to answer charges about illicit tracts. He promptly joined Walwyn's group and was taken into custody the same day. Walwyn came to Lilburne's defence in a tract which conjoined the biblical roots of his political beliefs with his understanding of natural law: &#145;the common Law of equitie and justice&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Englands Lamentable Slaverie</span>, 1645, 5). Addressing Lilburne, Walwyn stated that the difference between them in religion (Lilburne was a separatist and Calvinist) in no way diminished Walwyn's respect for Lilburne's &#145;undaunted resolution&#146; in defence of liberty, but he chided Lilburne for his reliance on <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> wrested abusive laws &#145;out of the pawes&#146; of kings, but &#145;that messe of pottage&#146; should not be extolled as the birthright of the people. The liberty that Lilburne claimed was &#145;as due you as the ayre you breathe&#146;; it was as unnatural for a man to testify against himself &#145;as to urge a man to kill himselfe&#146;  (ibid., 1, 4, 5). Walwyn's concepts were more advanced than Lilburne's and his intellect was more profound, but he was captivated by the younger man's purpose and courage, and with Richard Overton they led those who would be called Levellers.<br>
<br>Religious freedom was a cornerstone of the birthrights that became the heart of the Leveller programme. Walwyn's <span class="italic">Toleration Justified</span> was the first of many tracts that he published during the religious controversy that flooded the presses in 1646. Walwyn recalled the year as a time when, while parliament's army was victorious,<blockquote>there brake forth here about London a spirit of persecution; whereby private meetings were molested, &amp; divers pastors of congregations imprisoned, &amp; all threatned; Mr. Edwards, and others, fell foule upon them, with his Gangreen after Gangreen, slander upon slander. (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 2)</blockquote>Walwyn's five replies to Thomas Edwards are among his most attractive pamphlets. Edwards's relentless censure of proponents of toleration&#151;which included direct attacks on Walwyn as &#145;a desperate dangerous man, a Seeker and Libertine&#146;  (T. Edwards, <span class="italic">The Second Part of Gangraena</span>, 1646, 26)&#151;were countered by Walwyn's steady appeals to reason, flashes of wit and irony, and ultimate reliance on love. The first reply, with the softly subtle title <span class="italic">A Whisper in the Eare of Mr. Thomas Edwards</span>, is the first tract that Walwyn published over his own name.<h2>
<a name="Levellerleader"></a>Leveller leader</h2>The Levellers were the only proponents of representative democracy in revolutionary England and until 1647 they invariably appealed to the House of Commons for implementation of their proposals. In February 1645, replying to William Prynne's proposal for a national religion, Walwyn wrote that liberty of conscience was beyond the regulation of any elected body: &#145;the people of a Nation in chusing of a Parliament cannot confer more than that power which was justly in themselves &hellip; therefore no man can refer matters of Religion to any others regulation&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Helpe to the Right Understanding</span> 1645, 4). In October <span class="italic">England's Lamentable Slaverie</span>'s defence of birthrights added secular rights beyond the power of parliament. Seven months later, in May 1646, <span class="italic">A Word in Season</span> praised parliament as the guardian of the people's interests and in June <span class="italic">The Just Man in Bonds</span> reiterated faith in the Commons as Walwyn urged them to free Lilburne from his imprisonment by the Lords. Lilburne was not released, and in the first week of July, Overton, with some assistance from Walwyn, released a wider appeal: <span class="italic">A Remonstrance of Many Thousand Citizens</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span> was the first of the great Leveller petitions&#151;and the first comprehensive statement of Leveller goals. Addressed &#145;to their owne House of Commons&#146;, the manifesto reminds members that they hold their trust as representatives of the sovereign people. Amid harsh denunciations of kingship and the Lords, demands emerge: absolute religious freedom; a press free to all; an end to monopolies and discriminatory taxes; unjust laws reformed in &#145;agreement with common equity, and right reason&#146;; kings&#151;&#145;the continuall Oppressours of the Nation&#146;&#151;and the House of Lords abolished  (R. Overton and W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span>, 1646, title, 5, 15).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span> fractured an alliance between the Levellers and Independents. In May, John Goodwin's congregation had contributed 50<i>s</i>. toward the second printing of Walwyn's <span class="italic">Word in Season</span>, which Lilburne distributed in Westminster Hall. After <span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span> was published, two petitions were suppressed because &#145;Goodwins people, and some other of the Independent Churches&#146; contended that it was &#145;against the season&#146;. At the same time a &#145;most shamefull aspertion&#146; was dispersed about Walwyn, who believed that a committee of Goodwin's people was formed to discover &#145;whatsoever I had said, that might tend to my disparagement&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 2&#150;3). Independents concluded that the most dangerous Leveller was &#145;Mr William Walwyn, who (as the Serpent that deceived our first Parents was more subtle then any beast of the field which the Lord God made) is much more crafty then the rest of his brethren&#146;  (J. Price, <span class="italic">Walwins Wiles</span>, 2nd edn, 1649, 2).<br>
<br>From August 1646 until November 1647 Walwyn played the leading role in the co-ordination of the Levellers as a distinct party with a programme and an organization to advance it. Overton had been arrested five weeks after the publication of <span class="italic">A Remonstrance</span>; like Lilburne he remained in custody until autumn of 1647. Neither Lilburne nor Overton was silenced while in gaol, but the organization and promotion of petitions were the work of Walwyn. The petitions were primarily manifestos designed to publicize demands and bring dissidents together. Walwyn later denied &#145;that I, or any that I ever knew, petitioned for such things as we did hope the Parliament would not grant&#146;, although he conceded that &#145;we had cause to doubt&#146; that the parliament would agree  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 5).<br>
<br>Between March and early June 1647 Walwyn advanced four petitions addressed to the Commons. The first, the &#145;large petition&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Gold Tried in the Fire</span>, 1647, A1), which Walwyn subsequently implied was his work, was a response to rising harassment by high presbyterians in the city. Walwyn's principal allies were General Baptists who gave a lead to other sectaries who provided steady support for the four appeals. The large petition (March 1647) presented a programme for the reforms demanded in the 1646 <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>: an end to any negative voice for the Commons; comprehensive law reform published in English; speedy justice and humane treatment of prisoners; dissolution of all monopolies; unlimited religious freedom, and abolition of tithes. Printed copies of the petition were circulated and on 15 March two advocates of the appeal were imprisoned. On the 20th a second petition was presented that asserted the right of petition and demanded that the prisoners be released and the first petition received. On 20 May a third petition again protested the arbitrary arrests and again asked for the right to present the large petition. The house ordered the three petitions burnt.<br>
<br>Meetings with Oliver Cromwell and City Independents alarmed by the growing power of the high presbyterians were followed by a fourth petition &#145;of many thousands&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Gold Tried in the Fire</span>, 11)&#151;&#145;the last and most sharp of any&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 5)&#151;that conjoined grievances of Levellers, Independents, and opponents of summary disbandment of the New Model Army. On 2 June the petition was laid aside by the Commons. Within a fortnight Walwyn reprinted all the petitions with a preface that recounted their history and concluded that there was no good &#145;at all to be expected from those that burn such Petitions as these&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Gold Tried in the Fire</span>, A2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The final petition included a demand for a response &#145;unto all the just and reasonable desires of your Commanders, Officers, &amp; Souldiers&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Gold Tried in the Fire</span>, 12), and the publication of <span class="italic">Gold Tried in the Fire</span> exposed Walwyn's disillusionment with parliament and his move toward the army as the rising political power. Walwyn subsequently wrote that he &#145;perswaded&#146; Cromwell to join the regiments at Newmarket in early June and that when army headquarters moved to Reading a month later he &#145;was by very eminent persons of the Army, sent for to Reading, to be advised withall touching the good of the people&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 6). In addition to &#145;eminent persons&#146;  (ibid.) it is probable that Walwyn met with regimental agitators who, on 6 July, presented Lord-General Fairfax with a paper protesting the imprisonments of Lilburne and Overton. Walwyn's influence was also discernible when the army's general council assembled on 16 July. Agitators immediately submitted a &#145;Representation&#146; that called for a march on London unless parliament responded to demands that included the release and indemnification of all &#145;illegally committed&#146; prisoners  (Firth, 1.171).<br>
<br>Walwyn's accord with senior officers and Independents collapsed in August. The army entered London and Walwyn and his allies journeyed to headquarters to urge Fairfax to put the Tower, City, and borough under the control of citizens rather than regiments. Fairfax decided otherwise, siding with the City Independents. Harsh attacks on Walwyn again circulated and the &#145;great falling out amongst our Friends and theirs in London&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 7) extended to grandee officers who, &#145;notwithstanding their glorious March through London&#146;, had utterly neglected &#145;the prerogative Prisoners in the Tower, New-gate, and elsewhere&#146;  (J. Lilburne and others, <span class="italic">The Second Part of Englands New-Chaines</span>, 1649, 4).<br>
<br>The concurrence of Levellers and army radicals that was indicated at Reading played a major role in the general council that began at Putney on 28 October. The meeting was prompted by <span class="italic">The Case of the Army Truly Stated</span>, which was presented to Fairfax on 18 October. It is unlikely that Walwyn had any part in the drafting of the patchy text, but shortly after the general council convened Walwyn's hand can be detected in the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> that all but replaced the prolix <i>Case</i> during the debates. Under 1000 words overall, the substance of the <span class="italic">Agreement</span> was common to all Leveller penmen but the lucid phrasing of four concise articles and the eloquence of the preamble and conclusion leave little doubt that the final draft was Walwyn's work. Inflammatory demands were avoided and the first three articles concerned the redistribution of parliamentary seats, dissolution of the present parliament, and biennial elections. The heart of the Leveller programme was the final article, which enumerated five rights beyond the power of parliament: freedom of religion; freedom from conscription; freedom from questions about conduct during the war unless excepted by parliament; equality before the law; just laws, not destructive to the people's well-being. &#145;These things&#146;, stated the conclusion, &#145;we declare to be our native Rights, and therefore are agreed and resolved to maintain them&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Agreement of the People</span>, 1647, 5).<br>
<br>Walwyn took no part in the debates at Putney and no known part in the failed November mutiny to establish <span class="italic">An Agreement</span> by force. It is probable, however, that he participated in the November campaign to secure signatures in support of <span class="italic">An Agreement</span>, which became a propaganda device. After the turn of the year the party structure evinced during his petitioning campaign the previous spring was revealed, but Walwyn escaped notice in contemporary accounts of Leveller activities and he apparently published nothing during the first seven months of 1648.<br>
<br>The violence of the second civil war roused Walwyn to ill-considered anger against parliament and senior officers. <span class="italic">The Bloody Project</span> of August 1648 advanced from the (unfair) premise that the war was the &#145;causelesse&#146; design of &#145;Grandee Factions&#146; to a denunciation of the deaths of thousands who had never been told the goals for which they were fighting. How Walwyn would have dealt with royalist forces that initiated the war to defeat parliament and its army was not revealed. Walwyn's desire for an exposition of purpose was not unreasonable, and his harsh criticism of erstwhile allies was followed by reiteration of the Leveller programme. In the postscript Walwyn's appeal for reconciliation advanced sensible compromises including one solution that would be instituted in 1689: &#145;If the Peace of the Nation cannot be secured without the Restauration of the King, let it be done &hellip; and provide against his mis-government for the future; let his power be declared and limited by Law&#146;  (W. P. Gent [W. Walwyn], <span class="italic">The Bloody Project</span>, 1648, title-page, 16).<br>
<br>With the return of peace the Levellers led the way for a new settlement. In November, Walwyn was one of four Levellers on the committee of sixteen established to draw up a constitution. At Windsor the Levellers and Henry Marten prepared a working draft while the army marched to London to &#145;breake up the Parliament&#146;&#151;which, wrote Lilburne, &#145;was very much opposed by M. Walwyn, and many reasons he gave against their march to London at all&#146;  (J. Lilburne, <span class="italic">The Legall Fundamentall Liberties</span>, 1649, 34). The &#145;many reasons&#146;  (ibid.) may have included fear of further violence; there is no indication of how Walwyn would have managed a parliamentary majority poised to surrender to the king. In London, the committee of sixteen completed a draft agreement that prescribed biennial parliaments and a council of state, extended the franchise and reapportioned house seats. Eight explicit rights were reserved to the people, including equal justice under law and the free practice of religion for anyone professing Christianity. The text was presented to the council of officers at Whitehall on 11 December.<br>
<br>Walwyn and John Wildman attended at least one council debate after Lilburne withdrew and published his version of the second <span class="italic">Agreement</span>, and their absence from Leveller activities thereafter suggests a division within the Leveller leadership. Walwyn's withdrawal is explicable. With the end of the second war his innate optimism reappeared as he worked for an acceptable settlement. In April he concluded that the officers' <span class="italic">Agreement</span>:<blockquote>although in many things short &hellip; of what is necessary for the good of the Commonwealth, &hellip; yet, had it been put in execution, we should scarcely have interrupted the proceedings thereof, since therein is contained many things of great and important concernment to the Common-wealth. (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Manifestation</span>, 1649, 7)</blockquote>The Levellers were silent during the trial and execution of the king and the establishment of the republican Commonwealth, but on 28 March, four days after the appearance of <span class="italic">The Second Part of Englands New-Chaines Discovered</span>, the new government arrested Lilburne, Overton, Thomas Prince, and Walwyn. Lilburne was astonished that Walwyn was included, &#145;he having for some moneths by past &hellip; never bin at any of our meetings, where such things were managed&#146;  (J. Lilburne and others, <span class="italic">The Picture of the Councel of State</span>, 1649, 2). Walwyn ultimately concluded that his arrest had been incited by adversaries in John Goodwin's congregation. Less than three weeks before his seizure Walwyn had published harsh attacks on the Independents, questioning their lack of &#145;true piety or reall Christian vertue&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">The Vanitie of the Present Churches</span>, 1649, 23). Three weeks after he was imprisoned a vicious attack, principally if not solely authored by John Price, a lay preacher in Goodwin's church, described Walwyn as skilled in &#145;deluding, cozening and deceiving a plain and honest generation&#146;, a man of &#145;Atheisticall and blasphemous opprobries&#146; who contended that &#145;it would never be well untill all things were common&#146;  (J. Price, <span class="italic">Walwins Wiles</span>, 1649, 3, 9, 13).<br>
<br>Walwyn's decency and charity belie the monster described in <span class="italic">Walwins Wiles</span>. At the same time Walwyn's portrayal of himself as an artless innocent is unsupported by his writings or activities. He was, as he contended, a believer in absolute religious freedom and the power of reason. He was, as his son-in-law Brooke stated, a good and gentle man who treasured his quiet family life yet felt compelled to work for the liberties of all men. He was also a shrewd politician. Independents were right about his skilful use of petitions. Conclusions about his economic beliefs are risky. Walwyn insisted that &#145;turning the world upside down&#146; was &#145;not a work I ever intended&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Walwyns Just Defence</span>, 24), but he never denied that his ideal state included economic as well as political and legal justice. As early as 1643 Walwyn praised the sharing practices of early Christians when &#145;the multitude of beleevers had all things common&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">The Power of Love</span>, 1643, A4<i>v</i>). In 1649 he drafted <span class="italic">A Manifestation</span>, which, even as it denies any intent of &#145;equalling mens estates&#146;, adds that it would be injurious &#145;unlesse there did precede an universall assent thereunto&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">A Manifestation</span>, 1649, 4). Walwyn did not, like Lilburne, repudiate the communism of Gerrard Winstanley and his &#145;true Levellers&#146;  (J. Lilburne, <span class="italic">Legall Fundamentall Liberties</span>, 1649, 75), but there is no evidence that he supported Winstanley and in 1652 Walwyn delineated the essence of capitalism in contending for competition in a free market. He may have assisted a communal plan projected by Peter Cornelius Plockhoy in 1659, but the evidence is tenuous, and Walwyn made no known statement about economic equality after 1649.<h2>
<a name="InterregnumandRestoration"></a>Interregnum and Restoration</h2>By the time the four Leveller prisoners were released on 8 November 1649 the party they had created was shattered. Walwyn took the engagement of loyalty to the Commonwealth the day he left the Tower and resumed his quiet life in Moorfields. Nothing suggests that he again associated with dissidents and the only political pamphlet that he published includes an expression of confidence in the Commonwealth. <span class="italic">Juries Justified</span> was provoked by Henry Robinson's proposal to replace juries in small jurisdictions with judges named by parliament. The plan was contrary to the Leveller belief in judgment &#145;by twelve sworn men of the Neighbor-hood&#146;  (J. Lilburne, and others, <span class="italic">An Agreement of the People of England</span>, 1649, art. 25). In a masterful defence of a &#145;fundamental essential liberty&#146; Walwyn refuted Robinson point by point as he upheld the willingness of freeborn Englishmen to serve and their ability to judge fairly, concluding that his defence probably is not necessary &#145;for certainly Juries cannot in time of Parliament be in any danger&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Juries Justified</span>, 1651, 1, 14).<br>
<br>Five months later Walwyn presented the council of state's committee for trade and foreign affairs with a paper supporting free-traders in dispute with the Levant Company. Free trade was a basic Leveller tenet and despite his years of prosperity as a member of the Merchant Adventurers' Company, Walwyn had denounced &#145;the oppressive Monopoly of Merchant-adventurers&#146; in the large petition of March 1647  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Gold Tried in the Fire</span>, 2). His 1652 argument began with a characteristic equation of &#145;a publique good&#146; with &#145;Common Right&#146;&#151;which had &#145;ever proved to include what hath been most proper and commodious for the Common-wealth&#146;. From &#145;the ancient and continuall Claime of Right unto a generall freedome of Trade&#146; Walwyn proceeded to an enumeration of the practical economic benefits of competition. Free trade might not immediately &#145;produce so many wealthy men, as have been in the same time by Companies, &hellip; yet it will produce Thousands more of able men to beare publique Charges or what other publique occasions they may be called unto&#146;. Trade should not, <span class="italic">Conceptions</span> concluded, be restricted to companies that secured monopolies by &#145;a Purchase from prerogative, &hellip; the Common Enemy&#146;, but returned to the people, whose claim &#145;hath its foundation in Common Right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings</span>, 447, 451&#150;2). Reasonable and clearly stated, Walwyn's plea did not prevail.<br>
<br>The summer of 1653 was filled with reports of conspiracies, and on 29 August the council of state issued an order to commit Walwyn to the Tower. No record has been found of his imprisonment or release and it is unlikely that the order was executed. There is no hint that Walwyn had any subsequent brush with officials. His name is last known in a political context during the chaos that preceded the Restoration. A Leveller tract by William Bray included Walwyn among those listed as champions of free parliaments bound to comply with &#145;the Fundamental Lawes and Liberties of the Nation&#146;  (W. Bray, <span class="italic">A Plea for the Peoples Fundamental Liberties</span>, 1660, 9).<h2>
<a name="Medicalpractitioner"></a>Medical practitioner</h2>Some years before the Restoration, Walwyn became a medical practitioner. Precisely when this occurred is not known, but he was dispensing medications by 1654 when he wrote that he had been studying things appertaining to health for many years. Abandonment of trade as a merchant may not have been Walwyn's decision. He had broken his oath of loyalty to the Merchant Adventurers in 1647 and it is unlikely that the company would have overlooked the attack. Whatever the reason for his move Walwyn continued to prosper and his first medical treatise stated that &#145;next the things of everlasting concernment&#146; nothing had given him &#145;so much satisfaction in minde&#146; as the practice of medicine  (W. W. [W. Walwyn], <span class="italic">Spirits Moderated</span>, 1654, 25&#150;6).<br>
<br>Walwyn was singularly qualified for the profession of lay physician. His medical judgement was grounded in his philosophy of love and his natural humanity assisted the thoughtful intelligence with which he considered the needs of the sick. Nothing, he wrote, should be given to the sick that might not safely and profitably be taken by those in health, and such &#145;molesters of the sick&#146; as bleeding, purging, vomiting, sweating, and blistering ought to be &#145;laid asleep for ever&#146;  (W. W. Healths Student [W. Walwyn], <span class="italic">Physick for Families</span>, 1669, 6, 20). The sick should at all times be treated with kindness, quietness, and hopefulness, and be protected from &#145;busie talkers&#146; and &#145;dejected visitants&#146;  (ibid., 1674 edn, 11). Case histories and testimonials recorded from <span class="italic">Healths New Store-House Opened</span> (1661) through four editions of <span class="italic">Physick for Families</span> suggest that Walwyn's &#145;Milde and pleasant&#146; potions  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Spirits Moderated</span>, 14) were harmless and consequently achieved the customary success that follows inert treatment.<br>
<br>Walwyn did not immediately disparage professional physicians. His medicines were first dispensed from the Aldgate house of his physician son-in-law, Dr Humphrey Brooke, who doubtless gave Walwyn some guidance. Both men were concerned with prevention as well as cure, and Walwyn advises a sensible diet and recourse &#145;to the judicious and conscionable Physitian, in times of Sickess&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Spirits Moderated</span>, 4). Fifteen years later, before vivid descriptions of &#145;molesters of the sick&#146;, Walwyn questioned &#145;the Worth or Ability of Physitians&#146; compared with &#145;the Reality and Excellency of Medicines&#146;. One practice he most harshly condemned was repeated bleeding, &#145;a hazard of a strange nature for Patients &hellip; upon which Death so often follows&#146;  (W. W. Healths Student, <span class="italic">Physick for Families</span>, 9&#150;10). The title page of Walwyn's second medical tract describes him as &#145;Health's Student&#146;  (<span class="italic">Healths New Store-House Opened</span>, 1661, title-page), and the two editions of <span class="italic">Physick for Families</span> published in his lifetime are by &#145;W. W. Healths Student&#146; (1669, A3<i>v</i>; 1674 edn, title-page). There is no known evidence that Walwyn used a different title for any publications.<br>
<br>By 1661 Walwyn's medicines were being sold at The Star in Postern Street joining Little Moorfields, the area where Walwyn had lived since 1643. Presumably the potions continued to be available at The Star through Walwyn's lifetime, including during the plague of 1665 when Walwyn moved his family to Surrey but took care that his preparations were obtainable while he was away. The 1681 posthumous edition of <span class="italic">Physick for Families</span>, &#145;By William Walwyn Physician&#146;, advertised the medicines for sale at the house of Richard Halford, Walwyn's son-in-law, of Finsbury, Little Moorfields, who stated that he had assisted Walwyn &#145;for many years&#146; and possessed &#145;all his Secrets and Receipts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Physick for Families</span>, 1681 edn, title-page, last page verso of unpaged index).<br>
<br>Walwyn died in January 1681 and was buried on the 16th of that month at St Giles Cripplegate, London. Halford was executor of his will, which indicated that Walwyn outlived his wife and all his children. The will named two sons-in-law and four grandchildren, and bequests of &pound;200 each to a son-in-law and three granddaughters suggest that Walwyn had no financial difficulties. The will also revealed Walwyn's inherent optimism and joyous expectation that bodily death would be followed by a life of the spirit in the presence of a loving God.<h2>
<a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>Walwyn is an attractive revolutionary. Principled and perceptive, he was a clear thinker, a talented writer, and a respected adversary. Opponents who considered him the ablest of the Leveller leaders were openly dismayed by his proficiency in framing and managing petitions promoting the Leveller programme. More enduring than his work with petitions are Walwyn's many pamphlets. Love of mankind was the source of his commitment to the rights of all people and his bold proposals were unsurpassed. Unqualified freedom of religion; equal justice; representative governments elected by the sovereign people; an end to harsh and futile treatments for the sick&#151;all these Walwyn advocated in readable prose distinguished by the probity of the writing as well as the humanity of the proposals. Walwyn believed everything he wrote, which gives his works an integrity illuminated by his ability to present radical solutions with civility and conviction.<br>
<br>Walwyn's writings are as revealing of his character as of his intellectual depth and literary skill. Sometimes subtle, often optimistic, and always purposeful, he was as concerned with the individuals whose rights he defended as with their abstract liberties. The gentle goodness and loving family life described by his son-in-law are compatible with Walwyn's avoidance of public notice, rejection of destructive tactics of any kind, and belief that men should follow the golden rule&#151;&#145;whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, that do you unto them&#146;&#151;the &#145;rule of reason and pure nature&#146;  (W. Walwyn, <span class="italic">Toleration Justified</span>, 1646, 14). As long as men were imperfect, contended Walwyn, they would differ, and all differences should be considered by rules of reason: &#145;There being nothing that maintaines love, unity and friendship in families, Societies, Citties, Countries, Authorities, Nations; so much as a condescention to the giving, and hearing, and debating of reason&#146;  (Walwyn, <span class="italic">Fountain of Slaunder</span>, 18).<br>
