<span class="headword">Leyds,  Willem Johannes</span>  (1859&#150;1940), <span class="occ">politician in the Transvaal and diplomatist</span>, was born on 1 May 1859 at Magelang, Java, the second son of Willem Johannes Leyds (1828&#150;1865), a Dutch headmaster, and his wife, Tryntje, <i>n&eacute;e</i> van Beuningen van Helsdingen (1832&#150;1914). Leyds was a musical child and also had a photographic memory. He won a scholarship to the Rijkskweekskool voor Onderwijzers in Haarlem where he trained as a teacher (1874&#150;8); during teaching spells in Breda and Amsterdam he saved money to continue his education and also taught himself Latin and Greek. In 1880 he enrolled as a law student at the University of Amsterdam, where fellow students let him join an &eacute;lite society without having to pay membership fees. He was awarded an LLD <i>cum laude</i> in 1884. In the same year, on 10 July, he married Louise Wilhelmina Susanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roeff (1856&#150;1907). They had three children: Willem Johannes, Louis Willem, and Wilhelmina Johanna. After being introduced to a delegation from the Transvaal (South African/Zuid-Afrikaansche Republic) by his university professors, Leyds was offered the post of state attorney of the republic by President Kruger. Leyds and his wife duly travelled to Pretoria where he was sworn in on 13 October 1884.<h2>
<a name="Stateattorneyandsecretary"></a>State attorney and secretary</h2>Leyds applied himself with great diligence to his new post. His reputation for incorruptibility was enhanced by the sensational trial of the tycoon A. H. Nellmapius in 1886: despite government pressure to drop the case, Leyds refused to do so and succeeded in getting Nellmapius convicted. The scope and complexity of Leyds's work as state prosecutor and supervisor of the police and prison services was increased by the rise in crime after the 1886 gold rush in the Witwatersrand, and he was involved in improving laws and introducing a secret police force. As the judicial adviser of the republic he was also involved in negotiations with the British government concerning Bechuanaland, St Lucia Bay, and the new republic.<br>
<br>Leyds's efficiency was tacitly recognized by several foreign orders which were conferred upon him, including a British knighthood which he politely declined. At only twenty-nine years of age he was elected state secretary of the South African Republic; on 2 May 1889, a day after he had reached the required minimum age of thirty, he was duly sworn in. As secretary, Leyds became Kruger's &#145;right hand&#146;, and they effectively ran the actual government of the republic together. Despite great differences in age, education, and cultural background, both strove to make the republic a strong, independent Afrikaner state and trusted and respected one another. Although they did clash at times, Kruger once told Leyds that he continued to trust him because &#145;you tell me everything to my face; you never do anything behind my back&#146;  (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Leyds's tenure of office coincided with a difficult transitional period when the republic had to transform itself almost overnight into a modern industrial state. He was instrumental in modernizing the Transvaal, creating an efficient administrative system, helping to establish (in 1891) a national bank and a mint, and chairing a monetary conference in 1893 attended by representatives from the Cape, the Orange Free State, and Natal whose outcome was a treaty to create a uniform monetary system. Leyds was also largely responsible for the establishment of the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappij (NZASM) which obtained the sole right to construct and control the republic's railways and resulted in rail links with the Cape (1892), Mozambique (1894), and Natal (1895). His efforts to promote cultural ties with the Netherlands were strengthened by the appointment of N. Mansvelt as superintendent of education. Mansvelt improved existing education along Dutch lines and established a Staatsgimnasium, or Normal College, to train teachers, in 1893. Leyds promoted related projects, such as a botanic garden, a museum, and a bacteriological institute (later the Onderstepoort) in the Transvaal.<br>
<br>Leyds was also closely involved in the South African Republic's unsuccessful overt and covert attempts to obtain an outlet to the sea via St Lucia Bay, Kosi Bay, and Delagoa Bay&#151;schemes which failed mainly owing to British opposition. Negotiations with France and Germany to construct an independent cable connection between Delagoa Bay and Europe also failed. Ever concerned about the security of the South African Republic, Leyds, although generally opposed to the republic's monopolistic concession policy, favoured the maintenance of the dynamite monopoly, since he felt state control of weapons and explosives was necessary. This stance made him unpopular with Rand capitalists but English press reports that the Kruger&#150;Leyds government cared nothing for the mining interests were unfair. Leyds negotiated an agreement with the Mozambique government in 1897, for example, to recruit African workers for the mines. The republic's government saw the influx of foreigners after 1886 as a serious threat to the South African Republic's continuance as an independent Boer republic. Uitlanders were consequently subjected to discriminatory franchise qualifications and Johannesburg was denied a municipality. By not resolving Uitlander grievances the Kruger&#150;Leyds government played into the hands of British imperialists who later used the problem as a <i>casus belli</i>. During the Jameson raid (1895&#150;6) Leyds was on sick leave in Europe. He wanted to use the anti-British feeling aroused by the attempted coup to have the South African Republic's independence and neutrality guaranteed by the major European powers. However, in his absence his opponents in the Transvaal sowed distrust about his aims and about the possible outcome of the plans for the republic; the scheme was therefore aborted. Leyds was the chief target of &#145;Hollander hate&#146; in the Transvaal, generated partly by the number of Hollanders whom Kruger had appointed to high posts. He was nevertheless re-elected as state secretary in 1892 and 1897 with increased majorities.<br>
<br>Leyds's able defence of the South African Republic against claims of British suzerainty and his efficient management of its affairs made British imperialists regard him as the chief obstacle to the overthrow of Kruger's government. Leyds was consequently largely demonized in the jingoistic British press. The British colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, and the under-secretary, Lord Selborne, were therefore surprised when they met him in 1897 to find him &#145;distinctly agreeable&#146;, &#145;clever and good-looking&#146;, and possessed of an &#145;extraordinarily frank and conciliatory attitude&#146;. Selborne warned Chamberlain not to praise Leyds in public, however, because &#145;all British South Africa, from Rosmead to Rhodes and from Hartley to Schreiner are united in believing him to be <i>the</i> enemy, and whether it is true or false, all that you say will be judged in the light of this prejudice&#146;  (Selborne to Milner, 24 May 1897, University of Oxford, MS Milner Dep. 204, fols. 67&#150;8).<h2>
<a name="AmbassadorduringtheSouthAfricanWar"></a>Ambassador during the South African War</h2>In 1898 Leyds was appointed ambassador-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to the courts of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, and Russia; despite British denial of the South African Republic's right to foreign representation, Leyds, whose fluency in five European languages made him eminently suitable for the post, gained accreditation at all six courts, and chose centrally located Brussels as his headquarters. He warned his government not to expect aid from any European government in the event of a South African war and, on a visit to the Transvaal in 1899, he was behind the &#145;great deal&#146;&#151;secret negotiations with Rand capitalists to resolve their grievances. The reconciliation attempt was, however, scuppered through a deliberate leak to the press by an agent of the war-mongering Lord Milner. After the outbreak of the South African War, Leyds tried to persuade one or more of the European powers to mediate and bring about an honourable peace for the Boers. A Russian mediation attempt in March 1900 floundered, however, partly owing to official German opposition. Leyds also launched a pro-Boer campaign, helped by press bureaux in Paris and Dordrecht, raising money for South African War victims, establishing an aid fund, advising pro-Boer groups abroad, and serving as a channel for protests against alleged British contraventions of international conventions, and for petitions for European intervention such as the &#145;Appeal to the nations for justice and peace&#146;.<br>
<br>On 26 July 1900 the Transvaal executive adopted a secret resolution empowering Leyds to withdraw all the republic's considerable assets from European banks and place them under his personal control to be used at his discretion to further the Boer cause&#151;a testimony to their confidence in him. Since Britain controlled the cable links between South Africa and Europe, Leyds made use of secret couriers and neutral shipping lines to maintain communications with the Transvaal. With the aid of secret agents he also purchased arms and ammunition which were smuggled to the Boers by the same means.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>When peace was finally declared, Chamberlain stated that Leyds would not be allowed to return to South Africa. He settled in Holland and resumed his former Dutch citizenship in 1905 but continued to act unofficially as a Boer representative. He declined offers of Dutch academic and diplomatic appointments, drawing on the South African Republic's government archives, which had been sent to him for safe keeping in 1900, to publish twelve books on the republic's struggle against British imperialism, from the British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 to the end of the South African War. Leyds also composed Kruger's <span class="italic">Political Testament</span> of 1904 and, after Kruger's death, arranged for the return of his body to South Africa, personally accompanying the coffin to Cape Town.<br>
<br>Leyds refused to hand over the remainder of the South African Republic's secret funds to Britain after the South African War, as he wanted to use the money to promote the political, economic, and cultural resurrection of the former Boer republics. He purchased stock for the impoverished farms, provided funds for the Christian National Education schools, for the re-emergence of Afrikaans/Dutch newspapers, and for the establishment of the Het Volk and Orangia Union political parties. These projects went against Lord Milner's Anglicization programme and helped to create a spirit of Afrikaner solidarity. Leyds advised Boer leaders such as Botha and Smuts on political tactics to achieve self-government and secretly assisted Smuts in his negotiations with the Liberal government in Britain in 1907 which led to the restoration of self-government in the former Boer republics. In 1907 Leyds's wife died, leaving two children (Willem having died in infancy). He married a second time, on 8 October 1910, taking Anna Castens, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grissee (1868&#150;1942), as his wife.<br>
<br>Leyds visited South Africa in 1908&#150;9 and in 1911 and continued to take a lively interest in South African affairs until his death, corresponding with leading political figures and voicing his opinion on matters such as the rebellion of 1914 and South African participation in the First World War. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of Pretoria and Stellenbosch, in 1936 and 1939 respectively. His home in The Hague was at 237 Frankenslag, and he died in hospital in The Hague on 14 May 1940 during the German invasion of the Netherlands. He was buried alongside his first wife in the Eik en Duinen cemetery, The Hague.<br>
