<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newnes, Sir  George</span>, first baronet  (1851&#150;1910), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician</span>, born on 13 March 1851 at Glenorchy House, Matlock, was the youngest of the six children of the Revd Thomas Mold Newnes (<i>d</i>. 1883), Congregational minister, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of David Urquhart of Dundee. He was educated at Silcoates School, Yorkshire, Shireland Hall, Birmingham, and for two terms at the City of London School. At sixteen he was apprenticed to a wholesale haberdasher in the City, subsequently travelling in haberdashery and managing a shop in Manchester. In 1875 Newnes married Priscilla, daughter of the Revd James Hillyard.<br>
<br>On 24 August 1881, reading the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>, Newnes's attention was arrested by an item, &#145;A runaway train&#146;. In that moment he conceived the idea of a journal made up entirely of entertaining and interesting anecdotes&#151;&#145;tit-bits&#146; as he called them. He failed to obtain outside financial backing for his idea, but scraped together sufficient to produce the first number of his weekly journal, which appeared on 22 October 1881. Within two hours he had sold 5000 copies. <span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span> was to be the matrix of twentieth-century popular journalism. A man of business, all bustle and energy, by bold innovation&#151;prize competitions, free insurance schemes, and treasure hunts&#151;and an unerring sense of the prejudices and preferences of his lower middle-class readers, Newnes ensured his journal's commercial success. But he sought also to improve the literary diet of the masses. It was his earnest hope that readers of <span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span>, saved at least from reading the worst, might develop an interest in better forms of literature. A token of his earnestness was the way he scrutinized every line printed, and he would remove anything he thought unduly lurid, sensational, or smutty. As the contents improved so did the sales. Within a decade <span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span> provided Newnes with an annual income of &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>W. T. Stead, the most celebrated journalist of the day, who had been Newnes's contemporary at Silcoates, agreed to edit a new digest of journals, to be called the &#145;Sixpenny Monthly&#146;. Before its first appearance, in January 1890, it had metamorphosed into the weekly <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>. Two such very different men were never likely to work comfortably together. Newnes distrusted Stead's judgement, fearing writs for libel and even imprisonment. After six months the partnership was dissolved by mutual agreement, Stead buying out Newnes for &pound;3000, &#145;a fair and reasonable price&#146;. Newnes, always concerned about the welfare of his employees, retained the extra editorial staff he had engaged for the <span class="italic">Review of Reviews</span>. He was contemplating a new kind of magazine to employ them. On style and typography he was undoubtedly influenced by American journals, but it was H. Greenhough Smith who gave Newnes the idea that was to become the <span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span>&#151;a monthly, each issue complete in itself, like a book, all stories and articles lavishly illustrated. The first number appeared in January 1891, and the print of 300,000 sold out completely. Monthly sales were soon to exceed half a million, and the <span class="italic">Strand</span> became a perennial best-seller. The magazine exercised an important and beneficial influence upon English short-story writing. It also created and enhanced the reputations of many graphic artists, like Sidney Paget (1860&#150;1908), the first illustrator of Conan Doyle's immortal detective, Sherlock Holmes.<br>
<br>In 1885 Newnes entered parliament as Liberal member for Newmarket; he held the seat for ten years. When defeated in the 1895 election he took it with very good humour. Almost immediately he was offered the safe Liberal seat of Swansea, which he held from 1900 until his retirement in January 1910. His single distinction as an MP was to be nominated one of the best-dressed men in the house. If he said little, he was particularly valued by Lord Rosebery as a press magnate prepared to buy and maintain newspapers favourable to the Liberal cause. Newnes was duly rewarded in 1895 with a baronetcy &#145;for political services&#146;, a euphemism for subsidizing Liberal newspapers. The citation, however, also acknowledged Newnes's &#145;good work &hellip; in the cause of healthy popular literature&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1892, when W. W. Astor bought, in the tory interest, the previously Liberal <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, Newnes seized the opportunity to found a new Liberal paper. &#145;The scheme will find favour with the leading men of the party,&#146; he correctly told E. T. Cook, who became the first editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. From 1896, under J. A. Spender's editorship, the &#145;pea-green incorruptible&#146;, as <span class="italic">Punch</span> dubbed the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, was unchallenged as the honourable, influential, Liberal, heavyweight newspaper. But its circulation was never better than 25,000, and with an advertising revenue of a mere &pound;40,000, the <span class="italic">Westminster</span> was a commercial flop. Newnes would not have it cheapened or vulgarized to increase sales, for nothing should imperil its influence among serious readers. In time the ever mounting debt of the <span class="italic">Westminster</span> wearied even Newnes. In 1908 it was at last sold to a Liberal syndicate headed by Sir Alfred Mond (1868&#150;1930), but continued to lose money.<br>
<br>Newnes's publishing company was one of the first to receive a stock exchange quotation. When the company was restructured in 1897, Newnes was appointed permanent governing director. He was joined on the board by his son, Frank, straight down from Cambridge and more interested in and knowledgeable about golf than publishing, who replaced Lewis Tomalin. The other key board member was Edward Hudson. The Newnes publishing empire expanded to include <span class="italic">Country Life</span> (1897), <span class="italic">Woman's Life</span> (1898), the first women's weekly magazine, and the <span class="italic">World-Wide Magazine</span> (1898), the offspring of an excess of travel and adventure stories submitted by <span class="italic">Strand</span> readers. But not all was success; some new journals were short-lived, artistic and commercial failures. There was the imaginative and original four-coloured twopenny weekly, <span class="italic">The Million</span>. A morning penny newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Courier</span>, edited by Newnes himself and designed to compete with Harmsworth's new, halfpenny <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, crashed within four months. There was also a disastrous venture in Sunday newspapers when Newnes acquired the venerable <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>. Newnes's religious scruples would not allow him to employ the same means as the <span class="italic">Dispatch</span>'s main rivals, the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> and <span class="italic">Lloyd's Sunday News</span>, to win and boost circulation. Eventually he was forced to sell out to Harmsworth for &pound;25,000.<br>
<br>Newnes's capacities as an editor had always been limited. <span class="italic">Tit-Bits</span> exercised a strong sentimental grip and he never altogether rid himself of his delight in scraps of information. His business sense, however, was always acute until, from the mid-1890s, it was undermined and finally overthrown by the ravages of diabetes and alcohol. Public displays of hopeless drunkenness probably cost him elevation to the peerage. As his condition worsened, he would disappear from home, sometimes for weeks at a time. He lost a fortune speculating wildly on oil and rubber. In the City remaining confidence in his business acumen was destroyed, and his company's share quotation and dividends plummeted. In the end his estate was entirely swallowed by debt.<br>
<br>As a son of the manse, Newnes had appeased his conscience about his sudden and enormous wealth by demonstrations of practical concern for the welfare of the less fortunate, public benefactions, and service in parliament. His gifts included a fine library for the citizens of Putney, where he had his London residence; a cable railway for his birthplace, Matlock; and a cliff railway at Lynton where he had his country house. Newnes and his wife had two sons; the death of the elder boy, aged eight, devastated him. The second son, Frank Hillyard (1876&#150;1955), served as a Liberal MP from 1906 until 1910 and was involved in publishing and a range of commercial concerns. Newnes died at Lynton on 9 June 1910, where he was buried. His last years had been tragic for him, his family, and the managers of his various business interests. He deserves, however, to be remembered as the masterful head of a great publishing company, genial, generous, and inspiring. He was the supreme innovator in an industry that succeeded by imitating success. That others imitated him so successfully and made fortunes from his ideas, pleased rather than annoyed Newnes. It had been his enterprise that forged the means to assail illiteracy and gratify the first mass reading public. He believed it was enough &#145;to give wholesome and harmless entertainment to hard-working people craving a little fun and amusement&#146;. If this was, in his own words, &#145;no great ambition&#146;, none could deny that he succeeded in it completely.<br>
