<span class="headword">Watts,  Charles Albert</span>  (1858&#150;1946), <span class="occ">freethought editor and publisher</span>, was born at 72 Hill Street, Walworth, London, on 27 May 1858, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47699/', "Charles Watts (1836&#150;1906)")</script>, secularist and journalist, and his first wife, Mary Ann Tomkins (1836&#150;1870). He was educated at national schools and night school, and at the age of twelve followed his father into the freethought movement. In 1870 he was apprenticed to Austin Holyoake (1826&#150;1874), who ran a printing and publishing business in Johnson's Court, Fleet Street. He continued there when his father took over the business on Holyoake's death, and took it over himself when his father went to North America in 1882; the arrangement was made permanent when his father settled in Canada in 1884. He established Watts &amp; Co. as the leading freethought publisher in Britain, and also initiated new departures in periodicals and organizations. At first he preferred the rubric of agnosticism, under the influence of Herbert Spencer and T. H. Huxley, but he later adopted that of rationalism, on the advice of F. J. Gould (1855&#150;1938).<br>
<br>In 1884 Watts launched the <span class="italic">Agnostic Annual</span>, which continued as the <span class="italic">RPA Annual</span> and later as the <span class="italic">Rationalist Annual</span>, and edited it until 1943. At the beginning of 1885 he launched a monthly paper, <span class="italic">The Agnostic</span>, which lasted only until the end of the year; but in November 1885 he launched another monthly paper, <span class="italic">Watts's Literary Guide</span>, which continued as the plain <span class="italic">Literary Guide</span>, and edited it until 1946 (possibly a record).<br>
<br>Watts took his father's part in the quarrel with Charles Bradlaugh in the National Secular Society in 1877, and joined him in the rival British Secular Union in 1878. When this collapsed on his father's departure, he worked to form a new freethought organization. In 1885 he called for an agnostic press fund and in 1889 for a propagandist press fund. In 1890 he founded the Propagandist Press Committee, which in 1893 was renamed the Rationalist Press Committee and in 1899 incorporated as the Rationalist Press Association Limited (RPA), with the veteran G. J. Holyoake as chairman. He served as managing director until 1930 and as vice-chairman until his death, and was largely responsible for making it the main sponsor of freethought publications in English.<br>
<br>Unlike his father and most other freethought leaders Watts was a poor speaker and writer (all the publications listed under his name in the British Library catalogue were written by his father). He concentrated instead on editing and publishing, and on laying personal and financial foundations for such work. He secured the endorsement of the RPA by distinguished sympathizers as honorary associates and the involvement of wealthy supporters as financial benefactors. The main benefactors were George Anderson, Henry Cooke, Lady Florence Dixie, Sydney Gimson, Clair Grece, Lord Hobhouse, Herbert Leon, T. Pepperell, marquess of Queensberry, and Horace Seal. The honorary associates included William Archer, A. W. Benn, Arnold Bennett, Georg Brandes, J. B. Bury, Georges Clemenceau, Patrick Geddes, J. B. S. Haldane, J. A. Hobson, Julian Huxley, Leonard Huxley, Ray Lankester, H. J. Laski, Cesare Lombroso, Bronislaw Malinowski, Hiram Maxim, John Morley, Bertrand Russell, Leslie Stephen, G. M. Trevelyan, Graham Wallas, H. G. Wells, and Emile Zola. The membership of the RPA rose steadily during the rest of his life, and he launched several successful series of cheap publications which sold millions of copies. He was also a strong though silent supporter of the ethical movement.<br>
<br>In 1930 Watts was forced by ill health to retire from full-time work, though he remained editor of his periodicals and maintained daily contact with the office until his death, when a third generation of the family took over from him. On 14 September 1885 he married Sarah Chater (1862&#150;1915), the daughter of a Nottingham druggist. They had three children: a son, Frederick Charles Chater Watts (1896&#150;1953), who succeeded his father as managing director, and twin daughters Gladys, later Dixon (1886&#150;1971), and Sallie (1886&#150;1915), who also worked for the organization, as later did their granddaughter Marion Watts. On 14 October 1916 Watts made a second marriage, to Bessie Maud Wright (1880&#150;1960), the daughter of a London mariner. In 1938 they left London and settled in the Oxfordshire village of Sibford Gower, where he died on 15 May 1946, having served the freethought movement without pause for seventy-six years, done what he could to make it respectable and reliable, and established some of its most stable periodicals and organizations. A secular cremation was held at Oxford and a memorial service was held at Conway Hall in London on 10 October 1946, after which his ashes were interred at Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Watts contributed editorial material to most issues of his magazines and occasional autobiographical articles to the <span class="italic">Literary Guide</span>, including &#145;About personal matters&#146; (June 1918), &#145;Some reminiscences of no. 17 Johnson's Court&#146; (January 1924), and &#145;Twilight thoughts&#146; (April 1924). Obituaries appeared in the freethought press, including the <span class="italic">Literary Guide</span>, 61/7 (1946) and 61/11 (1946). But, as he said himself, his true biography appeared in his publications and his organization. Although he soon shed the vestiges of his family's Calvinism, he always remained a puritan in his personal and professional character. He worked long hours for most of the days of his extensive career, inspired many colleagues to follow his lead, earned a formidable reputation not only among freethinkers but in the wider world of publishing and the press, and enjoyed a happy private life with his family and friends.<br>
