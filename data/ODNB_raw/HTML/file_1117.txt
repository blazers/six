<span class="headword">Baker,  George</span>  (1773?&#150;1847), <span class="occ">organist</span>, was born in Exeter, the son of John Baker. At the time of his matriculation at Oxford in 1797 he stated his age to be twenty-four, thus dating his birth at 1773. His first music lessons were from his mother's sister, and he was proficient on the harpsichord at the age of seven. His next teachers were William Jackson, organist of Exeter Cathedral, and Hugh Bond, also of Exeter. He was taught the violin by Ward. At the age of seventeen Baker went to London under the patronage of the earl of Uxbridge, and through his patron became a pupil of J. B. Cramer and J. L. Dussek. While in London he performed his celebrated piece &#145;The Storm&#146; at the Hanover Square Rooms, meeting with the approval of Dr Burney.<br>
<br>In 1794 or 1795 Baker was appointed organist of St Mary's Church, Stafford, a new organ by Geib having been purchased five years before. He matriculated in 1797 and took the degree of BMus at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, but he appears not to have taken his doctor's degree while at Stafford, for in the town's corporation books he is called &#145;Mr Baker&#146;. On 5 March 1795 there is an entry to the effect &#145;that the organist be placed under restrictions as to the use of the organ, and that the mayor have a master key to prevent him having access thereto&#146;, and on 16 July 1795 &#145;it is ordered that Mr George Baker be in future prohibited from playing the piece of music called &#147;The Storm&#148;&#146;. During the following years several entries show that Baker habitually neglected his duties, and on 19 May 1800 the record is &#145;Resignation of Baker&#146;. In the previous year he had married the eldest daughter of the Revd E. Knight of Milwich.<br>
<br>In 1810 Baker was appointed to the post of organist at All Saints', Derby, and finally, in 1824, he accepted a position at Rugeley, but from 1839 his duties were undertaken by a deputy. He produced a large number of compositions, including organ voluntaries, piano sonatas, anthems, glees, and violin solos, which were quickly forgotten. He is said to have been very handsome, with a fair complexion. He died on 19 February 1847 at Rugeley.<br>
