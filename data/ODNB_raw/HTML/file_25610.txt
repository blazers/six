<span class="headword">Fychan,  Simwnt</span> <span class="st"> [Simon Vaughan]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1606), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was one of the last great practitioners of the traditional bardic skills in Wales. He gave his paternal pedigree as Simwnt Fychan ap John ap Jenkin ap Hywel ab Ieuan Fychan. As his forebear was named Ieuan Fychan, it would probably be best to assume that Fychan (small, little) was Simwnt's inherited surname, although Thomas Evans, his nephew and disciple, described him in his elegy as being of small stature. In a rental for 1465 his grandfather Jenkin ap Hywel is listed as a bondman in the commote of Llannerch (which comprised the parishes of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd and Llanelidan).<br>
<br>A long-standing oral tradition claims that Simwnt resided in a house called T&#375;-brith in Llanfair. There is, however, contemporary evidence that from 1580 onwards he dwelt in a house in Ruthin on the Thelwall estate. Thomas Evans seems to confirm that Simwnt continued to live in Ruthin up to the time of his death. Although he was not of aristocratic stock on his father's side, Simwnt claimed descent on his mother's side from the princes of Powys; his mother was Jonet, daughter of Marfred. He records that his wife was Lowri, widow of Thomas ap Gruffudd of Bodliwydd in the parish of Llanelidan.<br>
<br>Simwnt is reputed to have been one of the pupils of the bard Gruffudd Hiraethog, and at the second Caerwys eisteddfod (bardic congress), probably held in 1567, he was one of four who gained the highest bardic degree of <i>pencerdd</i> (chief of song). Copies of his graduation certificate have been preserved  (for example Thomas, facsimile facing 81). He composed a very large number of poems, most of which were eulogies and elegies to his patrons in the northern half of Wales. His datable poems show that he was a practising poet for over fifty years, from 1551 until 1603&#150;5.<br>
<br>All of Simwnt's poems were written in the Welsh strict metres. One of the best-known is a biting satire on the contemporary law courts. Another unusual offering from a Welsh bard of the period was a rather free translation of Martial's epigram on the happy life (book X, epigram 47), undertaken at the request, and with the help, of his patron, Simwnt Thelwall. This, according to a current classical scholar, was &#145;the earliest version of a classical work put into Welsh&#146;  (Davies, 67). Simwnt's poem, together with the Latin version and an anonymous English translation, was printed as a broadside in 1571. Another popular poem by Simwnt was his ode to Pirs Mostyn, which is said to have been exhibited at the Caerwys eisteddfod. It contains examples of each of the twenty-four strict metres of Welsh prosody.<br>
<br>There is ample evidence that Simwnt Fychan had mastered the curriculum of the bardic schools. He left a large collection of genealogical material (Cardiff County Library, MS 4.265, and other MSS). The Cardiff manuscript also contains his version of a medieval treatise on heraldry (edited by E. J. Jones in <span class="italic">Medieval Heraldry</span>, 1942). Simwnt Fychan's grammar, &#145;Pum llyfr kerddwriaeth&#146; (&#145;Five books of prosody&#146;), preserved in his autograph in Jesus College MS 15, is the most comprehensive of all the Welsh bardic grammars (reprinted in G. J. Williams and E. J. Jones, <span class="italic">Gramadegau'r penceirddiaid</span>, 1934, 89&#150;142). At the end of his version of the bardic grammar Simwnt included a copy of William Salesbury's treatise on rhetoric, dated 1551, and this copy was annotated and emended by Salesbury himself.<br>
<br>Simwnt died on 5 April 1606 and was buried eight days later in the chancel of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd church. Each of his three elegists, Si&ocirc;n Phylip, Edward ap Raff, and Thomas Evans, lamented the passing of a major poet and a leading authority on Welsh bardic learning.<br>
