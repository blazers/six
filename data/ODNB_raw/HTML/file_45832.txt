<span class="headword">White,  Dorothy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1686?), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, about whose life and parentage very few details are known, was the second most prolific Quaker woman writer in the seventeenth century; yet there are few Quaker figures as unknown. The standard biographical sources, usually quite comprehensive, merely confirm her obscurity; the major source for White's life is her own work.<br>
<br>White was probably resident in Weymouth, Dorset, in the 1650s, and in London following the Restoration. Of the texts relating to her Weymouth connection&#151;<span class="italic">A Diligent Search</span> (1659) and <span class="italic">An Alarm</span> (1660)&#151;the first also describes a brief imprisonment that occurred after White interrupted the service of a local priest. Her association with London emerges in her &#145;sufferings&#146; writing: <span class="italic">The Voice of the Lord</span> (1662) and <span class="italic">To All those that Worship</span> (1664) both indicate that she was imprisoned there. Moreover, in <span class="italic">Upon the 22nd Day</span> (1659), White explains that she was compelled to &#145;leave my own countrey in obedience to the Lord&#146;  (p. 7), confirming that her residence was not ordinarily London. In the cases of persecution both in Weymouth and London, however, White's text is the only surviving record of the assaults on her as there is no corroborative evidence&#151;unusual given the Quakers' meticulous attitude to recording sufferings.<br>
<br>This absence may just possibly be accounted for by the highly speculative idea that White was in (self-imposed?) exile from Quakerism between 1664 and 1684. The undated <span class="italic">Universal Love</span> describes, in language that is feminized and domestic, a prodigal returning home to the fold. The prodigal is an outcast, and the postscript to another text may indicate that White had been excluded from the movement: <span class="italic">A Visitation of Love</span> (1684) contains an endorsement of White's good character, which is arguably unnecessary had there been no dispute over her godliness. Neither of these texts was sanctioned by the Quakers' own publications committee, perhaps further indicating White's marginality.<br>
<br>Equally speculative is the theory that White married John Fincham (<i>d</i>. 1711), a rich Norfolk Quaker who died in Suffolk. Quaker records do no more than identify Fincham's wife as a Dorothy White of Thetford, Norfolk, dating the union to 12 March 1681. Apparently a son, Benjamin (<i>d</i>. 1727), became a banker. However if this marriage was Dorothy's, she later wrote under her unmarried name.<br>
<br>Dorothy White was an authoritative writer, often fashioning a role for herself as a spokesperson for the Quaker cause. When she described the fraught events at the end of the Commonwealth and the beginning of the Restoration as acts of God, her writing aimed to fortify the Quakers' resistance to tyrannical worldly powers. Whereas one would expect less radicalism in the 1680s texts, White's later work shows an interest in prophecy that is consistent with the earlier, more enthusiastic, period of Quakerism. Moreover, her texts seem to evidence considerable erudition: she is exceptionally skilful at writing biblically derivative prose (the &#145;ranterish&#146; source text, the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>, being a favourite). White's poetry, though, is less obviously accomplished. Possibly her spirituality was rather mystical; she certainly says little on the more material issues that commonly concerned Quakers, such as tithes.<br>
<br>Given the difficulty over identification, it is impossible to substantiate the belief that White died of a fever in St Giles Street, Cripplegate, London, on 6 February 1686  (<span class="roman">Dictionary of Quaker biography</span>). However, no woman under the name either of White or Fincham died in Dorset, Suffolk, or Norfolk at that time. Despite the almost total lack of information relating to White's position within the Quaker movement, and the fact that George Fox makes no reference to her, her own words perhaps best express her sense of community with Friends: &#145;my soul doth swim within the sea of love&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Epistle of Love</span>, 1661, 8&#150;9).<br>
