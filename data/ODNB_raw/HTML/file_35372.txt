<span class="headword">Palmer,  George William</span>  (1851&#150;1913), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer and benefactor</span>, was born in Reading on 23 May 1851, the eldest of the six sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21184/', "George Palmer (1818&#150;1897)")</script>, co-founder of Huntley and Palmers of Reading, and his wife, Elizabeth Sarah (1825&#150;1894), daughter of Robert Meteyard, Quaker druggist of Basingstoke. He was educated at the Quaker school of Grove House, Tottenham, and joined his father's firm in 1867, becoming a partner seven years later. He specialized in the production side, two of his brothers and four sons of George Palmer's brother Samuel in due course respectively managing the firm's two departments. In 1879 he married Eleanor, the eldest daughter of Henry Barrett, of Surbiton. They had no children. Soon after their marriage, they ceased to be Quakers and joined the Church of England.<br>
<br>Despite being a full-time partner in Huntley and Palmers, George William Palmer devoted much time to public affairs. In 1882 he was elected to Reading borough council, serving as mayor in 1888&#150;9 and later becoming alderman. He was Liberal member of parliament for Reading from 1892 to 1895, and again from 1898 to 1904, espousing Gladstonian free-trade views that were at variance with those of his conservatively minded brothers. He believed in the payment of MPs, a step not taken until 1912, and pressed for the Church of England to be freed from all state patronage and control. In addition, he served as justice of the peace both for Reading and for Berkshire. In 1902 he was made freeman of the borough of Reading, his father having been the only other person so honoured.<br>
<br>In 1898, after the death of George Palmer senior, Huntley and Palmers became a private limited company. There was no chairman until 1904, when George William Palmer was appointed after resigning his parliamentary seat owing to deafness. For the same reason he resigned the company chairmanship in 1906, the year in which he was given the rare honour, as a former back-bencher, of appointment to the privy council. Often absent on lengthy trips abroad, he scarcely provided the lead to the company that might have been expected of its senior family member. Huntley and Palmers' national and international supremacy in biscuit manufacture was being eroded at this time by Peek Frean, and a number of Scottish biscuit makers, some of which, during Palmer's lifetime, established manufacturing plants in England. Huntley and Palmers only reluctantly began heavy advertising in the popular press, and, although turnover in 1912/13 exceeded &pound;1.5 million for the first time, compared with &pound;1.25 million in 1897/8, net profit had increased only from &pound;165,000 to &pound;193,000.<br>
<br>Palmer's reputation is therefore likely to rest on his benefactions, most notably to Reading University College, on whose council he served from 1902 onwards; he was vice-president from 1905 until his death. He gave &pound;50,000 in memory of his father in 1905, and a recreation ground in 1909. Two years later he and his wife subscribed &pound;100,000 towards an endowment fund of &pound;200,000, intended to enable the college to achieve university status, which it did, in 1926. He founded a scholarship to allow former pupils of Reading School to attend the college. In his will he bequeathed to the college a further &pound;10,000. Over and above <i>ad hoc</i> gifts for building, and other funds of the college, he anonymously contributed large sums in order to wipe out its accumulated debt.<br>
<br>Like many other sons of formidable entrepreneurial pioneers, he was highly strung, peppery, and obstinate when he judged himself to be in the right. Yet he exercised a strong unifying influence throughout the extended Palmer family. A childless couple, he and his wife loved to entertain children, their parents, and other relatives and friends in the over-large mansion into which he had converted his father's modest Newbury residence of Marlston House. Since he detested the new-fangled motor car, he drove himself regularly in his carriage with a fine pair of horses to Newbury Station <i>en route</i> for Reading or London. His recreations included hunting and shooting. He adopted as his heir a nephew, Ronald, younger son of Sir Edward Bagnall Poulton, and a celebrated rugby football blue and international. Ronald Poulton-Palmer, as he became, was killed in 1915 during the First World War. George William Palmer did not live to see that distressing conflict, dying suddenly of a heart attack at Marlston House, on 8 October 1913. He was buried at Marlston, and was survived by his wife.<br>
