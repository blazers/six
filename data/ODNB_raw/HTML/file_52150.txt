<span class="headword">How,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1571), <span class="occ">organ builder</span>, was probably the son of the John Hewe who in 1485 was paid 13<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. for work relating to the organ in the lady chapel at York Minster, and who received the freedom of the city four years later. The younger John How, who also tuned and repaired the minster's instruments in 1531 and 1536, has been identified with the John &#145;Heweson&#146; made free of the city in the 1540s, which has led to speculation that the family originated from York. The Hows' workshop was &#145;at the sign of the Organe Pype&#146; in the London parish of St Stephen Walbrook, where John junior was churchwarden in 1535&#150;6, as his father had been before him. After the latter's death in 1519, How appears to have entered into partnership with John Clynmowe, or Clymmowe, and in 1526 they contracted to build a new organ for Holy Trinity, Coventry, for &pound;30. In 1531&#150;2 Eton College acquired a new instrument from &#145;Clymmo and his brother&#146;, from which it may be inferred that one partner had married the sister of the other.<br>
<br>When the London guild of organ makers was dissolved in 1531, the city gave How permission to transfer to the Skinners', an appropriate move given the use organ builders made of animal hides. It was as a member of this company that he signed a tuning contract with the church of St Andrew Hubbard in 1534, according to which he received an annuity of 12<i>d</i>. for maintaining its instrument. How made similar agreements with other city churches, though his annual fee, which was presumably based on the number and size of the organs, varied enormously. Thus from 1539 to 1554 St Mary Woolnoth paid him just 4<i>d</i>. a year, while at St Dunstan-in-the-West his charges increased from 12<i>d</i>. to 2<i>s</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. over the same period. Altogether he is known to have built or repaired over thirty organs, and there may have been others of which there is now no record. At the height of his career he exercised a virtual monopoly over his craft, and created the most extensive business of any organ builder in England before the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>By 1548 How's son Thomas was assisting him in his work. However, the various Edwardian injunctions against the use of florid polyphony and organs in church spelt financial ruin for the family, and it may have been for this reason that in 1551 How sold his house to the parish, though he continued to live there as a tenant. This arrangement remained in effect until the death of his widow, Anne, in 1585. The Marian restoration of traditional religion may have revived How's fortunes, but several references to him in the 1560s, when London's organs were again dismantled, confirm his decline into poverty. From 1563 his parish paid him an annual stipend of 52<i>s</i>., probably as sexton, and certain churches pensioned him off at his full fee for the last two or three years of his life. He is sometimes referred to as &#145;Goodman&#146; or &#145;Father&#146; How, doubtless in recognition of his age and to distinguish him from his son. How and his family may have harboured Catholic sympathies, for on 23 April 1561 Thomas was examined before the lord mayor of London on suspicion of recusancy, and admitted that he had not received communion since Queen Elizabeth's accession. How died apparently without leaving a will and was buried at St Stephen Walbrook on 20 March 1571.<br>
