<span class="headword">Cockburn,  William</span>  (1669&#150;1739), <span class="occ">physician</span>, about whose early life nothing is known, proceeded MA at Edinburgh on 9 July 1688. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> erroneously described him as a son of Sir William Cockburn of Ryslaw. His name occurs in the register of the University of Leiden as a student of medicine on 29 May 1691, he being then in his twenty-third year. While at Leiden he attended the lectures of his fellow Scot Archibald Pitcairne, and was strongly influenced by Pitcairne's combination of iatromechanism and Newtonian matter theory. Cockburn did not take a degree at Leiden, and returned to Britain about 1693. In that year he published his translation of Walter Harris's <span class="italic">De morbis acutis infantum</span> (1689), describing himself as &#145;W.C. M.S.&#146;, and in the preface praised the medicine of Thomas Sydenham. He dedicated the book to the countess of Roxburghe, alluding to his own &#145;particular ties&#146; to her. The nature of these ties remains unknown, but Cockburn appears to have had a powerful patron, possibly Lady Roxburghe's father, the marquess of Tweeddale. On 2 April 1694 Cockburn became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in London (he never got promotion in the college hierarchy), and about the same time he was appointed by the Admiralty board as physician to the Blue squadron. This was a sought-after position highly dependent upon patronage. His first book, <span class="italic">Oeconomia corporis animalis</span>, was published a year later, dedicated to Admiral Sir William Bridgeman. It was a sort of scheme of general pathology, or first principles of physic. Pitcairne's influence is evident in its mechanistic explanations, although his name is not mentioned.<br>
<br>In 1696 Cockburn brought out a small work entitled <span class="italic">An account of the nature, causes, symptoms and cure of the distempers that are incident to seafaring people</span>. This was a record of his two years' experience as ship's doctor on the home station. Among other things it points out that chills are due to the suppression of the perspiration, and it contains remarks on the cause of scurvy: the &#145;boatswain's favourites&#146;, he pointed out, suffered much more from scurvy than the men set to do the hard work, a diet of salt beef and pork requiring active exercise to carry it off. He had no notion, however, of the importance of citrus and other foods rich in vitamin C. Scurvy was not effectually banished from the fleet until Gilbert Blane's rules of victualling in 1795, and Cockburn was inclined to despise the ignorance of those who, &#145;at the name of scurvy, fly to scurvy-grass, water-cresses, and horse-radishes, but to what advantage may be easily understood by our foregoing theory&#146;. He was sensible enough to see that land scurvy, which the dogmatists of the &#145;scorbutic constitution&#146; discovered under many guises, &#145;is not so very frequent as it is commonly imagined, and that so-called cases of it are something else&#146;.<br>
<br>Through his connection with the fleet Cockburn was able to introduce his secret remedy for dysentery, which made his fortune. The account given (pamphlet on a <span class="italic">Medicine Against Looseness</span>, by La Touche, 1757) is that in July 1696 he was dining on board one of the ships in the company of the Admiral Lord Berkeley of Stratton, and captains Meese and Beaumont when, after some compliments to him, it was remarked that &#145;there was nothing farther wanting but a better method of curing fluxes&#146;. Cockburn replied that he thought he could be of use. The trial was made next day upon about a hundred patients on board Captain Meese's ship, the <i>Sandwich</i>, and proved brilliantly successful. The result was reported to the Admiralty board by Sir Cloudesley Shovell, who was directed to purchase a quantity of the electuary for the use of the Mediterranean squadron. Cockburn supplied the fleet with it for forty years, and it was probably in use also in the army on foreign service. William III conveyed his thanks to the inventor for a benefit of national importance, and Louis XIV tried to buy the secret for the French fleet through his ambassador in London, but war broke out in 1702 and put an end to the negotiations. Its fame brought Cockburn crowds of private patients suffering with fluxes of various kinds. During the spring of 1700 the admiral asked the Royal College of Physicians to comment on Cockburn's suggestion that all naval surgeons should record on a chart the exact symptoms of the dangerous fevers in the West Indies, and the effects of the remedies he proposed. After investigating, the eminent Walter Charleton reported that<blockquote>the Experientes and observations brought by the Dr. as the sole Ground, upon which he builds his new Method of treating the sick, seems to us neither authentick enough to engage our Belief, nor Consistent with those made by other physicians in the same countries. (Cook, 24)</blockquote>The college suggested that the Admiralty should find other cures.<br>
<br>Cockburn also sought fame as a natural philosopher. In 1699 he published an article in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> which attempted to explain, in mechanical terms, the action of a blister in curing a fever. He had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1696. On 26 March 1697 he was granted the degree of MD by King's College, Aberdeen. By about 1700 he had settled in London and begun building a successful career as a physician. He lived for many years on St James's Street, near Piccadilly. Cockburn seems to have kept his connection with the navy for many years, and in 1731 he became physician to Greenwich Hospital. When Swift went to London in September 1710 on the three years' visit chronicled in the <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, the first of his many recorded dinners was with Cockburn. The latter is often mentioned in the <span class="italic">Journal</span>, once as &#145;honest Dr. Cockburn&#146;, and another time as having &#145;generally such a parcel of Scots with him&#146;. Although Swift was more in the company of Drs Freind, Arbuthnot, and Garth, it was Cockburn whom he chose as his medical adviser. Cockburn possessed a large practice, some of it brought to him by his secret remedy for fluxes, and some of it doubtless by his other writings (in which the treatment was also vaguely given at first), on the <span class="italic">Virulente gonorrhoeae</span> (1717) and on the <span class="italic">Symptoms, Nature, and Cure of a Gonorrhoea</span> (2nd edn 1715). The latter was well thought of, went through four editions, and was translated abroad. In the same class of writings was his <span class="italic">Account of the Nature and Cure of Looseness</span> (2nd edn 1710). His other writings were pamphlets connected more or less directly with his secret remedy. One of these, <span class="italic">The Present Uncertainty in the Knowledge of Medicines</span> (1703), was a letter to the physicians in the commission for sick and wounded seamen, in which he remonstrates with them for their dogmatic narrowness of view. Another, <span class="italic">The Danger of Improving Physick</span> (1730), is a well-written rejoinder to the cabal of academical physicians who opposed him on account of his secret remedy, and particularly to John Freind, who turned against him in his <span class="italic">History of Physick</span> (1725) after being on good terms with him for twenty years. &#145;The most learned physicians&#146;, Cockburn says, &#145;are always most subject to obloquy, on account of their superior knowledge and discoveries&#146;.<br>
<br>Cockburn's first wife, whom he married in 1698, was Mary de Baudisson (1663/4&#150;1728), a widow, who died on 5 July 1728, aged sixty-four. On 5 April 1729 he married Lady Mary Fielding, eldest daughter of Basil, fourth earl of Denbigh. According to the contemporary gossip he found the latter, who was his patient, in tears at the prospect of having to leave London owing to her reduced circumstances, whereupon the doctor said, &#145;Madam, if fifty thousand pounds and the heart of an old man will console you, they are at your service&#146;. Cockburn is described as &#145;an old, very rich quack&#146;, and the lady as &#145;very ugly&#146;. He died in November 1739, aged seventy, and was buried on 24 November in the middle aisle of Westminster Abbey. His will was written on 4 December 1738, probably after the death of his second wife, since she is not mentioned. It was proved on 12 December 1739. The executors were Richard Shelley and James Cockburn, secretary to the duke of Argyll. Cockburn left several small bequests to various relatives, revealing his role as a family benefactor: to his cousin Helen Cockburn, Lady Allenbank, he left 100 guineas and his wives' diamonds, and he left &pound;200 to another cousin, Ann Cant, and her niece Amelia White. He forgave the debts of two other cousins. He left the bulk of his estate to Alexander Cockburn of Langtoun, whose relationship to the doctor was not specified. This included an estate at Stockton in co. Durham, which was leased for three lifetimes from the bishop of Durham. Cockburn died a wealthy man, although the exact extent of his wealth is not known.<br>
