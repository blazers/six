<span class="headword">Myers,  William Joseph</span>  (1858&#150;1899), <span class="occ">army officer and collector of antiquities</span>, was born near Primrose Hill, London, on 4 August 1858, the eldest son of Thomas Borron Myers (1826&#150;1882) of Porters Park, near Shenley, south Hertfordshire, and his wife, Margaret Storie, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18540/', "Henry Melvill")</script>, canon of St Paul's Cathedral. In November 1858 Myers's father inherited the family property in Hertfordshire, and Myers spent his boyhood there. He attended private schools at Brighton and Great Malvern, and Eton College (1872&#150;75). He went to a coach at Ehrenbreitstein on the Rhine, and after a short preparation passed into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1877.<br>
<br>Myers was commissioned second lieutenant in the 16th foot on 1 May 1878; he became second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 19 February 1880, lieutenant on 10 November 1880, and captain on 14 March 1888. He served with the 3rd battalion in the Anglo-Zulu War from April to September 1879. From 1882 to 1887 he served in Egypt, acting as aide-de-camp to Sir Frederick Stephenson in operations of the Sudan frontier field force in 1885&#150;6, and taking part in the battle of Giniss (30 December 1885); he was awarded the Mejidiye, fourth class. He also served in Gibraltar, Cyprus, and India. He was on the north-west frontier in 1891 with the 1st battalion, KRRC in the Hazara and Miranzai expeditions&#151;which included the engagements at Sangar and Mastan&#151;and served on the 1892 Isazai expedition. He left the regular army in 1894 and joined the KRRC 7th (militia) battalion in February 1897; he was promoted major in February 1899. He was devoted to, and a generous donor to, Eton College, and from February 1898 was adjutant of the Eton College rifle volunteers. In May they formed a guard of honour at Gladstone's funeral.<br>
<br>Myers had strong artistic and musical tastes and was a keen collector. From his schooldays he collected stamps, in South Africa Zulu weapons and trophies (and the pen with which the treaty of Ulundi was signed), in Egypt oriental fabrics and carpets, and later old prints and furniture. His most important collection was of Egyptian antiquities, purchased during his service in Egypt and on private visits there. At a time when extensive excavations were flooding the market with antiquities, Myers, with the advice and assistance of the German Egyptologist Emile Brugsch of the Bulaq Museum, purchased much from dealers and villagers. Among his friends was Percy Edward Newberry (later professor of ancient history and archaeology at Cairo University) who was to catalogue Myers's collection. It was wide-ranging and idiosyncratic: Myers bought what he considered aesthetically pleasing rather than archaeologically significant. He was especially fond of faience, &#145;Egyptian blue&#146;, glazed steatite, and glass. His collection was among the finest in England, and in 1895 he was one of the principal contributors to the Burlington Fine Arts Club &#145;Exhibition of the art of ancient Egypt&#146;. In 1898 he was elected FSA. He travelled extensively in Europe, Asia, the West Indies, and South America&#151;he rode across the Andes&#151;and attended music festivals, operatic productions, and the Oberammergau passion play. Apparently a confirmed bachelor, he was devoted to his widowed mother, and &#145;it has been said by those who know him best, that after his mother's death, Eton seemed in some sort to supply her place in his heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eton College Chronicle</span>, 19 Dec 1899, 763).<br>
<br>In 1899 Myers went to South Africa to fight in the South African War. He wrote back, &#145;Eton is never out of my thoughts &hellip; we shall all remember <i>Floreat Etona</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eton College Chronicle</span>, 19 Dec 1899, 763). He served with the 1st battalion, KRRC in Sir George White's force based at Ladysmith, Natal. Within three days of reaching the front he took part in White's unsuccessful offensive (variously named the battle of Ladysmith, Farquhar's Farm, Lombard's Kop, and Modder Spruit) on &#145;Mournful Monday&#146;, 30 October 1899. British officers were conspicuous and were targeted by Boer marksmen. Myers was killed, shot in the head, near Farquhar's Farm, near and east of Ladysmith, Natal. The <span class="italic">Eton College Chronicle</span> stated, &#145;We cannot but believe that it was the death of all others that he would have chosen&#146;  (ibid.). He is thought to have been buried at or near Ladysmith. Myers was commemorated by a memorial window in the lower chapel at Eton. He bequeathed his collection to Eton College, to form part of Eton's education and to inspire future generations. It is still held there, in the Myers Museum, together with his diary in thirty-six volumes.<br>
