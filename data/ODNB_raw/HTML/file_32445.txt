<span class="headword">Clerke,  Ellen Mary</span>  (1840&#150;1906), <span class="occ">translator and writer</span>, was born on 26 September 1840 at Skibbereen, co. Cork. She was the eldest of three children of John William Clerke (1814&#150;1890), classical scholar, graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, and manager of a bank in Skibbereen, and his wife, Catherine (1818&#150;1897), daughter of Rickard Deasy of Clonakilty, co. Cork.<br>
<br>Her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32444/', "Agnes Mary Clerke (1842&#150;1907)")</script>, whose middle name, like Ellen's, was an indication of the Clerke family's devout Catholicism, was born two years later. Neither married and the Clerke sisters were to be close companions throughout their lives. Their younger brother, Aubrey St John Clerke, became a Chancery barrister in London. Both women were very intelligent and had wide-ranging interests. They were educated to an exceptionally high degree at home and grew up to share a taste for literature, science, and music. Their father initially taught them astronomy, of which he was a keen amateur student. Both Clerke sisters later wrote about astronomy and Agnes became an eminent authority on the subject&#151;it remained a subsidiary interest for Ellen.<br>
<br>The Clerke family moved to Dublin in 1861 and then, in 1863, back to co. Cork to the small port of Queenstown (renamed Kobh after 1922), presumably in connection with John Clerke's work. By 1867, when Ellen was twenty-seven, they had settled in Italy where they remained for ten years, living mostly in Florence. During her time in Italy, Ellen, ever keen to enlarge the horizons of her knowledge, became fluent in the Italian language. She began to study Italian literature and to translate Italian texts for English publication. She also wrote critiques of Italian literature, samples of which can be read in Richard Garnett's <span class="italic">History of Italian Literature</span> (1897). Her <span class="italic">Fable and Song in Italy</span>, which was eventually published by Grant Edwards in 1899, and which was dedicated to Garnett, gathered together some of her earlier essays which had first appeared in periodicals such as the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. It also included line-by-line verse translations of poets such as Boiardo, a fifteenth-century Tuscan.<br>
<br>Shortly after the family's return from Italy to settle in London, where John Clerke died in 1890, Ellen had published in 1881 by W. Satchell &amp; Co. a volume entitled <span class="italic">The Flying Dutchman and other Poems</span>. It contains some of her own ballads, early and miscellaneous poems, along with some translations from Italian. Like most of her writing, the style, to the modern ear, is too controlled and self-consciously accurate to evince any real passion, though the range of mythological and literary subjects shows a formidable breadth and depth of learning.<br>
<br>Once she had taken up residence in London, Ellen also embarked on a weekly leader column in <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> which she kept up for twenty years. Always a woman of eclectic interests she wrote monographs on Jupiter and on Venus, published by Edward Stanford in 1892 and 1893 respectively. She also wrote occasional pieces for <span class="italic">The Observatory</span>, the journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, founded by William Christie in 1877, though her sister Agnes wrote many more of these.<br>
<br>Ellen was sixty-two before her novel <span class="italic">Flowers of Fire</span> was published by Hutchinson in 1902. It is a well enough written romance, in her usual careful prose, set in the cosmopolitan upper strata of Italian society which she knew so well. Its quaint formality has not worn well, though the physical description of the eruption of Vesuvius in chapter 24 imaginatively and effectively evokes the horror of the flames and fear as the heroine and her lover flee to safety while everyone else in the party perishes.<br>
<br>Ellen Mary Clerke died from bronchitis on 2 March 1906 at 68 Redcliffe Square in Kensington, the home she shared with Agnes, who outlived her by only ten months. Although she had written a great deal and achieved much, she seemed all her life to be overshadowed by her younger and better known sister. When <span class="italic">The Times</span> published its 400-word obituary of Agnes on 22 January 1907 it dismissed her sister with the words: &#145;Her sister Miss EM Clerke, who died a few months ago, also wrote on astronomical matters, though in a far more humble way.&#146; <span class="italic">Agnes Mary and Ellen Mary Clerke: an Appreciation</span> was printed for private circulation in 1907. It was written by Lady Huggins, wife of the eminent scientist Sir William Huggins, with a foreword by Aubrey St John Clerke.<br>
