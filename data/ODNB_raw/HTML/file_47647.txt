<span class="headword">Badley,  John Haden</span>  (1865&#150;1967), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 21 February 1865 in Tower Street, Dudley, Worcestershire, the only son of James Payton Badley, surgeon, and his wife, Laura Elizabeth Best. He had three older sisters to whom he was always very close. The home atmosphere was restricted in some ways but very supportive and affectionate, and he enjoyed a happy childhood. Dr Badley seems to have been a rather remote figure to the children, but he gave his son every possible opportunity, and the money he accumulated&#151;for he was a good man of business as well as a much respected doctor&#151;provided the essential backing for his son's later schemes. Badley went to Rugby School at the age of fifteen and was head of his house for three years. He enjoyed his time there and won an exhibition as the best classic of his year, but he felt later that the Rugby training, with its heavy concentration on the classics, had been very narrow and bookish.<br>
<br>From Rugby, Badley went on in 1884 to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class in part one of the classical tripos in 1887, and was elected to a college scholarship, staying on for a fourth year without taking any examination but reading widely. He wrote later that his Cambridge years, during which he was exposed to the ideas of Edward Carpenter and William Morris, had exerted a major influence on his later life. He met Amy Garrett (<i>d</i>. 1956), the sister of one of his Cambridge friends, whom he married in 1892. They had one son. He felt very uncertain about his future career until a friend, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson of King's College, put him in touch with Cecil Reddie. He joined Reddie's staff when the New School at Abbotsholme, Derbyshire, opened in October 1889, and was a master there until 1892. That short period determined the whole course of his professional life, for it was Reddie who helped him to discover what he wanted to do in education. He spoke later of having been apprenticed to a master craftsman.<br>
<br>Yet Badley's stay at Abbotsholme was to be brief. He disliked Reddie's autocratic system of management. He was anxious to marry, and he knew that there would be no role for his wife at Abbotsholme. In January 1893 he opened his own school at Bedales, near Haywards Heath in Sussex. Growth at first was slow, though the school soon became known in other countries through the writings of the French social theorist Edmond Demolins, who sent his own son to Bedales School. In 1898 a few girls were admitted, so that Badley could claim later that Bedales was the first boarding-school in the country to which boys and girls were admitted on a fully equal basis. The change would probably have occurred anyway since Badley himself was sympathetic and his wife was a supporter of the women's movement. Yet it happened in a curiously informal way when a mother who wished to send her daughters to the school offered to open a house for them. The number of boys and girls did not reach parity until the end of the First World War.<br>
<br>By 1900 the accommodation at old Bedales had become too small, and Badley bought a site and built a new school at Steep, near Petersfield in Hampshire. From then until his retirement in 1935 progress was steady. The school remained small; in 1935 there were 136 pupils, a decline from a high point of 194 in 1922. Badley believed in and practised democratic management, but there was no doubt that he was the leader&#151;a quiet, rather withdrawn figure to many people, though not to the children. After the First World War a school council was set up, although its role was entirely advisory. Towards the end of his life he defined his objectives as three-fold: a healthy environment, a wide range of work with considerable emphasis on the arts and on manual training, and a community structured on family lines. Academic work was taken seriously, and Bedalians had a good record at the universities. There were experiments in the curriculum. During the 1920s there were extensive trials of the Dalton plan of assignment work, and the Montessori method was followed in the junior house. In 1920 the Bedales School Company had been set up to control the school.<br>
<br>Badley had abandoned traditional religious beliefs while he was at Cambridge, but he was deeply interested in the moral aspects of Christianity. He talked and wrote on religious subjects, and he published an edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, re-arranged in historical sequence, <span class="italic">The Bible as Seen Today</span> (3 vols., 1965). His other major works include <span class="italic">Bedales: a Pioneer School</span> (1923), <span class="italic">A Schoolmaster's Testament</span> (1937), and an autobiography, <span class="italic">Memories and Reflections</span> (1955). Badley lived over thirty years after his retirement, dying on 6 March 1967 at the age of 102, at Fairhaven, Steep, Petersfield, Hampshire, a cottage on the school estate where he lived after his wife's death. He was cremated at Woking on 10 March 1967. He was the prophet of a new kind of school life, many of whose ideas have passed into the mainstream of English educational thinking.<br>
