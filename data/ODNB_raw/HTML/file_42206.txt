<span class="headword">Schinkel,  Karl Friedrich</span>  (1781&#150;1841), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Neuruppin, Mark Brandenburg, on 13 March 1781, the son of a pastor, Johann Cuno Christian Schinkel (<i>d</i>. 1787), and his wife, Dorothea, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rose (<i>d</i>. 1800). He studied with the architect David Gilly, between 1798 and 1800, and at the Bauakademie, Berlin, in 1799&#150;1800. In 1809 he married Susanne Berger (1782&#150;1861); they had four children. He had travelled to Italy in 1803&#150;4 and was to go again in 1824, but made only one visit to Britain, between 24 May and 5 August 1826. As Prussian privy councillor for public works he went to Paris and London to study the construction of museums, especially the British Museum, then at an early stage of construction, in preparation for his own work on the Berlin Museum (now the Altes Museum). The study of the British Museum was only one episode in a wide-ranging and eventful visit that took him from London through England, Scotland, and Wales. It is recorded in the manuscript travel diary of seventy-five sides and accompanying letters and additional drawings, known as &#145;The English journey&#146; (&#145;Die englische Reise&#146;, Nationalgalerie, Berlin).<br>
<br>Schinkel's many visits to workshops and factories were set up by his travelling companion Peter Beuth, director of trade and industry in the Prussian finance ministry, whose agenda was to buy samples of and to observe innovative British technology. Consequently their route through Britain was strongly biased towards workshops, factories, and commercial buildings, though Schinkel was able to view the buildings of London and cities on the route. He was generally disdainful of British architecture and speculative building, but was deeply impressed by the innovative use of iron-frame construction he saw almost everywhere. He responded admiringly to engineers he met, such as Henry Maudslay, but had little contact with architects.<br>
<br>Schinkel arrived in London, after three weeks in Paris, on 24 May, and stayed in the capital until 14 June. He visited numerous buildings, workshops, and factories, with trips to the Brighton Pavilion, Greenwich, and Windsor. On 15 June he, Beuth, and Count Danckelmann, went north, passing through Oxford, Birmingham, visiting the Thomason workshop, Dudley&#151;the chimneys here he described as &#145;smoking obelisks&#146;  (Bindman and Riemann, 128)&#151;the Gospel Oaks ironworks, and the Badnal cotton mill at Leek. Admiringly they passed by the Belper mills, and then through Sheffield to Leeds, where they met the industrialist Benjamin Gott at Armley House. Their next extended stop was Edinburgh, where Schinkel expressed a grudging surprise at the quality of the city's new architecture. He made two splendid panoramic drawings of the city  (ibid., plates 140 and 142), and after two days there the party went on to Glasgow, via Robert Owen's New Lanark. In their one full day in Glasgow they visited Charles Tennant's chemical works, Charles Todd's textile mills, and the Hunterian Museum, before heading north-west for a short holiday towards the Hebrides, or &#145;Ossianic Islands&#146; as Schinkel called them. Their objective was the romantic site of Fingal's Cave, where the Prussians sang in harmony to the sound of the waves  (ibid., 170).<br>
<br>Following this break of one week the party returned to London via the west of England and Wales. They reached Manchester on 16 July and Schinkel was appalled by the prospects the industrial city offered of overproduction, financial slump, and dreadful living conditions. He describes the &#145;dreadful and dismal impression&#146;  (Bindman and Rieman, 175) made by the huge cotton mills of Ancoats, but the brilliant drawings he made in the journal of them and the Manchester canal system reveal their fascination for him  (ibid., plates 164 and 165). He conversed in Liverpool with the city architect John Foster the younger, before the party left for Wales. They went through Conwy as far as the Menai Bridge, before returning to England via the great Pont Cysyllte viaduct. Here Schinkel expressed unequivocal enthusiasm for the designer of these two works and the Conwy suspension bridge, noting that they are &#145;All the work of Mr Telford, whose road construction is so arranged that from the Menai Bridge all his great works can be observed&#146;  (ibid., 188). The party went towards Bristol, and Schinkel remarked appreciatively on the ironwork in the Stanley Mill at King's Stanley, near Stroud. They spent a busy day in Bristol and two hours in Bath, which Schinkel found &#145;rather boring and wholly in the mean English style&#146;  (ibid., 197), before arriving back in London on 30 July. They remained in London until 5 August, then returned to Berlin by way of Calais and Belgium.<br>
<br>The effects of Schinkel's experience of British industrial buildings are clearly to be seen in his later architecture, in the Bauakademie (1831&#150;6) and the Neue Packhof warehouses (1829&#150;32), and the influence of his experience of ancient buildings is visible in many neo-Gothic works, but the most profound effect of &#145;the English journey&#146; was perhaps in his later emphasis on function as a determinant of architectural design. He continued to live in Berlin, a high official of the Prussian government, until his early death, brought about, it was widely believed, by overwork, on 9 October 1841. He was buried three days later in the Dorotheenstadt cemetery, Berlin.<br>
