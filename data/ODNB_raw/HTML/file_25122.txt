<span class="headword">Seton,  George</span>, third earl of Winton  (1584&#150;1650), <span class="occ">nobleman and politician</span>, was born in December 1584, the second son of Robert Seton, first earl of Winton (<i>d</i>. 1603), and his wife, Lady Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of Hugh Montgomerie, third earl of Eglinton. He was educated in France&#151;probably, following the tradition of his Roman Catholic family, at the Jesuit college of La Fl&egrave;che. He returned to Scotland before 18 August 1602, since on that date he appeared with his elder brother Robert (<i>d</i>. in or after 1636) before the Haddington presbytery and promised to be a &#145;diligent hearer of the Word&#146;. Following the death of their father, George was from 1604 styled master of Winton, but, after Robert's confinement for insanity and resignation of the peerage, he succeeded as third earl on 12 May 1607. Four years later his younger brother Alexander (1588&#150;1661) succeeded to the estates of their maternal grandfather, taking the name <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19053/', "Alexander Montgomery, sixth earl of Eglinton")</script>. Winton married, on 26 April 1609, Lady Anne (<i>d</i>. 1623&times;5), eldest daughter of Francis Hay, ninth earl of Erroll; they had four surviving children, George (1613&#150;1648), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25114/', "Alexander Seton (1621&#150;1691)")</script>, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Anna died some time between May 1623 and February 1625, and in or before 1628 Winton married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1664), daughter of John Maxwell, sixth Lord Herries, and his wife, Elizabeth Maxwell; they had twelve children, including Sir John Seton of Garleton and Sir Robert Seton (<i>d</i>. 1671).<br>
<br>Winton was sworn of the Scottish privy council on 30 July 1607, and attended thereafter about one in three meetings until the Scottish troubles commenced in 1638. He attended parliament in 1608. He was made justice general of St Andrews (south of the Forth) on 9 March 1608; he was appointed a justice of the peace for Haddingtonshire in 1612; he became a burgess of Glasgow on 11 July 1618; and he was appointed to the standing committee on manufactures on 17 July 1623. In 1620 he erected the additional residence of Winton Castle in the parish of Pencaitland, Haddingtonshire, an original and remarkably striking modification of Tudor architecture after Inigo Jones. He also extended and improved the principal residence at Seton Palace. In Cockenzie he built twelve saltpans and a great harbour, the latter of which was destroyed in a storm in 1635. During his lifetime he acquired lands in Longniddry, Athelstaneford, and Garleton, which he gave to his eldest son by his second marriage, John Seton of Garleton, who was created a baronet on 9 December 1664.<br>
<br>Winton's involvement in local and national issues increased in the reign of Charles I. He was particularly active in the privy council between 1625 and 1630 where, for example, in the period 1629&#150;30 he attended seventy-six out of 127 meetings. The high point occurred when he was made temporary president of the privy council from December 1625 to March 1626. He was made a commissioner of the exchequer on 8 March 1626 and in July of the same year was appointed to the commission for surrenders and teinds, a group established to oversee the king's controversial revocation scheme. His membership of other privy council committees included that for creating baronets in Nova Scotia, to investigate the office of high constable, and the debasement of the coinage. Winton was also appointed to the committee of council to prepare for Charles's coronation visit to Scotland in 1633, and was chosen one of the lords of the articles in the Coronation Parliament of that year. As he had done in 1617 during James VI and I's visit to Scotland, he twice entertained at his own expense Charles I and all of his court at Seton Palace.<br>
<br>Winton was referred to in 1638 by John Maxwell, bishop of Ross, as &#145;popishly affected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Works of Balfour</span>, 2.263), and on the commencement of the first bishops' war in 1639 his estate was sequestrated after he left Scotland to wait on the king. For his support of Charles I he was forced to pay a fine of 36,000 merks in 1643 and had to pay a ransom of &pound;40,000 Scots to the covenanters after his son Lord George Seton was captured on 13 September 1645 following the defeat of the marquess of Montrose at Philiphaugh. Despite this, he was a commissioner of war in Haddington in 1644 and 1646, and was appointed a commissioner for the accounts of Sir Adam Hepburn, treasurer of the army, on 11 November 1646. Two years later Winton fully supported the engagement intended to rescue Charles I from his imprisonment in England. During the mobilization, he was a colonel of horse and foot for the county of Haddington, and a commissioner of war in the counties of Haddington and Linlithgow. He also gave &pound;1000 sterling in free gift for his equipage to James, duke of Hamilton, general of the Scottish army authorized by the Scottish parliament to invade England. When Charles II arrived in Scotland in 1650 Winton constantly attended the young king, but in November returned to his palace in Haddingtonshire to prepare for the coronation at Scone on 1 January 1651. However, he fell sick shortly after arriving home and died at Seton of a palsy on 15 December 1650, aged sixty-five.<br>
