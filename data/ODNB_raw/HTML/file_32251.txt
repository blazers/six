<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Callwell, Sir  Charles Edward</span>  (1859&#150;1928), <span class="occ">army officer and writer</span>, was born on 2 April 1859 in London, the only son of Henry Callwell of Lismoyne, Ballycastle, co. Antrim, and his wife, Maud, fourth daughter of James Martin, of Ross, Connemara. He was educated at home by a German governess, at Haileybury College (1871&#150;6), and at the Royal Military Academy (1876&#150;7), Woolwich. In January 1878 he was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Field Artillery. After a short course for new officers at Woolwich and Shoeburyness, he travelled to India on HMS <i>Serapis</i>. In March 1879 he joined F battery of the 3rd brigade stationed at Dinapore. He was later attached to 10/11 heavy battery, in which he served during the closing stages of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, when he marched through the Khyber Pass to join the Kabul field force. Following his return to India he enjoyed five months' medical leave in Kashmir, before rejoining F battery at Dinapore. Shortly afterwards this battery was ordered to south Africa: it landed at Durban in January 1881, just in time to take part in the final operations of the Anglo-Transvaal War. Callwell returned to Britain in December 1881.<br>
<br>While stationed at Woolwich and then after being transferred to Aldershot, he began regularly contributing articles to the service press, notably the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Artillery Institution</span>, on a range of military issues, as well as preparing for the Staff College examination. In 1883 he returned to India with A/1 battery and was again stationed at Dinapore. In 1884 he passed comfortably first the entrance examination for the Staff College, Camberley, held at Jutogh, while still a subaltern. In the autumn of 1884 Callwell returned home and for the next two years studied at Camberley. While there he was promoted captain in March 1886 and later that year was awarded the gold medal for the Royal United Service Institution prize essay competition, with an essay on the lessons learned from British colonial campaigns since 1865. This established his reputation as a military theorist and was later translated into Italian.<br>
<br>After the course Callwell was briefly posted to the garrison artillery at Portsmouth before being attached to an infantry and later a cavalry unit at Aldershot. He attended as an observer Italian army manoeuvres near Reggio. In October 1887 he was posted as staff captain to the intelligence branch of the War Office in London, as a result of his extensive knowledge of foreign languages and countries; there he was appointed deputy assistant adjutant-general. He joined section E, responsible for Austria&#150;Hungary, the Balkans, Turkey, Egypt, and independent African states. Callwell proved highly successful and served in this post until September 1892, making several tours to Turkey, Greece, Algeria, and Morocco, and in Europe, to gather information. He returned to the garrison artillery at Sheerness before being appointed a year later brigade major of artillery to the western district at Devonport. In March 1896 he was promoted major and that year published <span class="italic">Small Wars: their Principles and Practice</span>, which became a standard text and firmly established his reputation as the army's foremost expert on colonial warfare, and was also translated into French. At the end of the year he was posted to Malta in charge of a garrison artillery company on coastal defence. Following the outbreak of the Graeco-Turkish War in 1897 he was attached as a military observer to the Greek army in the Near East while on leave, and was present at the battle of Domokos. He published <span class="italic">The Effect of Maritime Command on Land Campaigns since Waterloo</span> (1897) and <span class="italic">Tactics of Today</span> (1900).<br>
<br>Following the disasters of &#145;black week&#146; during the South African War, Callwell's company was sent in December 1899 to south Africa, where it was reorganized as a heavy battery. Callwell led his battery in Natal in support of operations under Sir Redvers Buller along the Tugela River, which led to the relief of Ladysmith on 28 February 1900, and then with the Natal army that crossed the Drakensbergs into the Transvaal. Callwell was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel in November 1900 and on 31 July 1901 was given command of a mobile column, operating under Sir John French, hunting down elusive, widely scattered Boer commandos in the western Transvaal and Cape Colony. He was not particularly successful in this role, and fell foul of Sir John French after letting a Boer commando under Van Deventer escape at Brand Kraal. Despite this setback, he remained a column commander until the war ended in 1902. When he returned to Britain he was stationed briefly at Cork and Dover in 1902&#150;3, while also serving on a committee of senior officers to select a new heavy gun for the Royal Artillery. He was then appointed a deputy assistant quartermaster-general in the mobilization branch of the War Office, in the strategical section dealing with the British empire and general questions of imperial defence that he first served in and then led. In October 1904 he was promoted brevet colonel, made substantive shortly afterwards, and was created CB in 1907. He continued writing on military affairs and produced <span class="italic">Military Operations and Maritime Preponderance</span> (1905), on joint operations between the army and the Royal Navy, and <span class="italic">The Tactics of Home Defence</span> (1908). Following the end of this War Office appointment in 1907, Callwell went on half pay and worked for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. After being passed over for promotion by several contemporaries and being offered only minor staff appointments, a piqued Callwell finally retired from active service later in the summer of 1909. He turned to writing as full-time employment, specializing in military affairs and military history. He wrote articles, short stories, and books&#151;including humorous parodies of life in the army and of War Office routine&#151;in various periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. These were later published in <span class="italic">Service Yarns and Memories</span> (1912). Callwell's more serious published work during this period included a didactic account of the 1897&#150;8 Tirah campaign, <span class="italic">Tirah, 1897</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, Callwell was recalled to active service and was appointed, with the temporary rank of major-general, to the influential post of director of military operations and intelligence at the War Office. With few trained and experienced staff officers remaining at the War Office, this was a particularly arduous appointment, and involved working closely with Lord Kitchener. Callwell was unwilling, however, to challenge the views of the overbearing new secretary of state for war, who misunderstood the role of the general staff and was reluctant to make full use of it. Instead, Callwell kept quiet and largely acquiesced in Kitchener's proposals. Perhaps most notably he did not actively seek an opportunity to put forward his personal views opposing a naval action at the Dardanelles, an operation he had studied in considerable detail in the intelligence department before the outbreak of war, and deferred instead to Kitchener's view. Despite his strong scepticism, Callwell was heavily involved in planning the Dardanelles campaign, for whose failure he was in small part to blame. Later Callwell drafted the memorandum that formed the formal basis for the recommendations of the new chief of the Imperial General Staff that Gallipoli should be evacuated. In December 1915 Callwell refused an offer from Sir Douglas Haig to be his military secretary. Callwell remained at the War Office until January 1916, when, following the appointment of Sir William Robertson as chief of the Imperial General Staff, the general staff underwent complete reorganization. Callwell was replaced when his post was split into two and new appointments were made for both positions.<br>
<br>Callwell was sent on two special missions to Russia in January&#150;February and March&#150;May 1916 to discuss the supply of munitions and other issues concerned with Russian co-operation in the war. Following his return to Britain in the autumn of 1916, he served on the War Office's Russian purchasing committee, served in the Ministry of Munitions as an adviser on the supply of munitions to Russia and then other various entente armies, and finally sat on the Milner committee. In May&#150;June 1917 he very briefly stood in for the deputy chief of the Imperial General Staff, was promoted substantive major-general, and created a KCB for his services.<br>
<br>Callwell returned to his previous career as a journalist and writer following the end of the First World War. His post-war work included <span class="italic">The Dardanelles</span> (1919), <span class="italic">The Life of Sir Stanley Maude</span> (1920), and two humorous autobiographical volumes covering his early career and military service between 1914 and 1918. In March 1921 he was awarded the Chesney medal of the Royal United Service Institution for his services to military literature and continued until his death writing for various military periodicals, most notably the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Artillery</span>. His later work included editing the autobiography of General Sir O'Moore Creagh and the memoirs of Sir Hugh MacCalmont and writing a tendentious two-volume biography (1920) of Sir Henry Wilson, whom he had known as a friend since boyhood. His last writing project was a history of the Royal Artillery, written in co-operation with Major-General Sir John Headlam, which appeared in 1937. Callwell died, unmarried, on 16 May 1928 at the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, Millbank, London.<br>
<br>Callwell was an accomplished linguist, a skilled intelligence officer, and a prolific writer of quality on a wide range of military affairs and on military history throughout his career. He acquired a reputation as a skilled theorist and, predominantly, as a staff officer. His only period of field command, however, was in south Africa, where he was not particularly successful. It was this failure and his passion for military writing that perhaps led to his being passed over and his early retirement from the army in 1909. Indeed, Callwell may well have been his own worst enemy by being indiscreet, having a sharp tongue, and writing parodies of military life and service at the War Office. Throughout his life, writing for the service press and military literature occupied a large part of Callwell's attention and he was perhaps more accomplished as a theorist than as a soldier. His <span class="italic">Military Operations and Maritime Preponderance: their Relations and Interdependence</span> was arguably the best study of joint warfare ever written. It is for his <span class="italic">Small Wars: their Principles and Practice</span>, however, that Callwell is best remembered. It remained a standard textbook on the subject for the British army up to the Second World War and, in the view of several historians, established his credentials as the founding father of modern counter-insurgency.<br>
