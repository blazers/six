<span class="headword">Farquhar,  William</span>  (1774&#150;1839), <span class="occ">colonial administrator in Singapore</span>, was born at Newhall, Kincardineshire, on 26 February 1774, the seventh son of Robert Farquhar of Newhall and his second wife, Agnes, eldest daughter of James Morison of Elsick, provost of Aberdeen. Following the entry of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9177/', "Arthur Farquhar")</script>, into the Royal Navy he was appointed to a cadetship in the East India Company, and after his arrival at Madras in 1791 he was gazetted ensign in the corps of engineers. He served in the grand army under Lord Cornwallis in Mysore, and in 1793, as adjutant to the corps of Madras engineers, he took part in the capture of Pondicherry.<br>
<br>Farquhar was engineer in charge of a party of Madras pioneers sent on the military expedition against the Dutch settlement of Malacca in 1795. After its capture he served as chief of staff to the British commandant with the rank of captain-lieutenant. In 1803 he succeeded to the post of commandant, later resident and commandant, which he held until the settlement was restored to the Netherlands in 1818. During his administration the Dutch legal and land systems were modified in accordance with British practice, but the revenues were never sufficient to meet the costs of administration and the East India Company decided to abandon the settlement and destroy the fortifications. Farquhar protested against this decision but it was not until the company's directors received a skilfully worded report from Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1808 that the order was countermanded.<br>
<br>Farquhar was appointed to take charge of military intelligence and of the guides during the British conquest of Java in 1811, and on 26 August he took part in the capture of the Dutch stronghold of Meester Cornelis. He declined the appointment of British resident at the Javanese court of Yogyakarta, and resumed his command at Malacca on 30 October. In the following year he was placed in temporary control of Bangka, where he supervised the construction of a fort and other buildings, and he later returned briefly to the island to report on its military defences. In 1818 he was appointed to conclude commercial treaties with the rulers of Riau, Lingga, and Siak, and he was subsequently ordered to assist Raffles in establishing a trading factory at Singapore. He was appointed first resident and commandant of the new settlement and set about constructing roads and allocating lands to the European merchants, who soon recognized Singapore's commercial potential. He was under instruction to restrict such grants of land to the south of the Singapore River but, because of the unsatisfactory nature of the ground, he was obliged to make temporary grants north of the river. This and other short-term measures brought him into conflict with Raffles, who dismissed him from office in 1823.<br>
<br>Farquhar returned to London in 1824 and protested, unsuccessfully, to the East India Company about his treatment. He settled at Perth in Scotland, and in 1828 married Margaret Loban (<i>d</i>. 1844), daughter of Robert and Isabella Loban of Fochabers, with whom he had six children; he had consorted in Asia with a half-Malay woman named Nonya Clement, or Clemaine, with whom he also had six children. In 1829 he was promoted to colonel and in 1837 to major-general. Farquhar had a keen interest in natural history and his discoveries at Malacca of the Malayan tapir, binturong (or bearcat), and banded linsang were among the most important ever made in Malaysian zoology, though none is named after him. He donated his large collection of natural history drawings, made by Asian artists, to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1826, but this was sold in 1993 and is now in the Singapore Art Museum. Farquhar died at Early Bank Villa, Perth, on 11 May 1839 and was interred in the burial-ground of Greyfriars, Perth, where a substantial monument to him was erected by his widow.<br>
