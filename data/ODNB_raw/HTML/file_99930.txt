<span class="headword">Higgs, Sir  Derek Alan</span>  (1944&#150;2008), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 3 April 1944 at 19 Sherbourne Road, Acocks Green, Birmingham, the only son of Alan Edward Higgs (1912&#150;1979) and his wife, Freda Gwendoline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hope (1914&#150;1984). At the time of his birth his father was employed as the branch manager of a building society, but an entrepreneurial flair led him into the building business, where he profited considerably from the rebuilding of Coventry after the immense damage done to the city during the Second World War. The young Derek and his sister Marilyn enjoyed a comfortable childhood in the west midlands. He was sent to the private Solihull School and went on to read economics at Bristol University, and graduated in 1965. But although he received a somewhat privileged upbringing and education, his father had always made it clear to him and his sister that they would not inherit his wealth, since he believed that inherited wealth took away pride and self-motivation. When Alan Higgs died his &pound;25 million estate was used to set up the Alan Edward Higgs Charity, the objectives of which were to benefit disadvantaged children and fund other socially progressive projects in the Coventry area. Derek and Marilyn Higgs became trustees of the charity.<br>
<br>From university Higgs went to work for the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, but after four years decided that merchant banking would be a more interesting career. Answering an advertisement that declared &#145;no experience necessary&#146;, in 1969 he joined the blue-blooded Baring Brothers as a corporate finance executive. On 30 May the following year he married an economist, Julia Mary Arguile (<i>b</i>. 1945), daughter of Robert Thomas Arguile, civil engineer. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Higgs soon realized that family connections rather than merit paved the way to the top at Barings, and he sought a place to work where skill and commitment mattered more than birthright. This led him, in 1972, to join S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. The bank was already running rings around some of its more establishment competitors, and the culture was entirely suited to both Higgs's nature and his meritocratic instincts. His attention to detail, affable nature, and keen intelligence brought swift promotion, and he soon established himself as one of the most notable deal-makers and trusted advisers in the City of London. He guided many of Warburg's clients through the boom years of corporate finance in the 1980s, where he was the key banker in such high-profile deals as Burton group's contested takeover of Debenhams. By 1986, still in his early forties, he was made head of corporate finance at the bank, a position he held until, in 1994, he was appointed chairman.<br>
<br>One deal, however, eluded Higgs. In 1994 he was one of a number of investment bankers who recognized that their banks needed to increase their capital base if they were to prosper as truly global businesses. He set about negotiating a merger with the American bank Morgan Stanley. After weeks of negotiations, without making public its reasons, Morgan Stanley backed out of the deal. The failure of the merger caused significant damage to Warburg's reputation, from which the bank never fully recovered. In 1995 Warburg was acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation, its standing as the doyen of the investment banking business lost for ever.<br>
<br>After this debacle Higgs resigned to become a director of the Prudential and chairman of its fund management business, a position he held for four years, until 2000. He then joined the boards of several companies as a non-executive director. They included British Land, Egg plc, and Allied Irish Banks. He was also in 2001 appointed senior adviser in the United Kingdom to UBS Warburg (as Warburg's had been renamed, following the merger of the Swiss Bank Corporation and the Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998), and subsequently to UBS Investment Bank (as it was once again renamed, in 2003), thus re-establishing a relationship with the firm with which he had spent the greater part of his working life.<br>
<br>It was for his work as head of a government inquiry into the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors in 2002&#150;3 that Higgs came to widest notice, and for which he was given a knighthood in 2004. His report into what had become known as &#145;corporate governance&#146; unearthed compelling evidence of the ineffectiveness of many existing governance arrangements and proved controversial, mostly because he recommended the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive, and other measures to strengthen the powers of non-executive directors. By the time of his death, however, most of his recommendations were seen as good practice and generally accepted and adhered to.<br>
<br>After the publication of his report Higgs became chairman of the Alliance and Leicester Bank in 2005. In his latter years he was also pro-chancellor of Bristol University (from 2002), a director of various bodies, including the Financial Reporting Council (1996&#150;2004), the City Arts Trust (1995&#150;2001), and the Scott Trust (from 2008), and the owner of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> newspaper, of which he was a lifelong reader. He was also a supporter of Coventry City Football Club, of which he was a director (from 1996 to 2008), and for whose Ricoh Arena he persuaded his father's trust to provide crucial funding. He attended his last Coventry City match two days before suffering a fatal heart attack in London on 28 April 2008. He was declared dead at Charing Cross Hospital the same day, and was survived by his wife, Julia, and their three children.<br>
