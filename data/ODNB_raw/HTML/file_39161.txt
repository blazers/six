<span class="headword">Whittaker,  Thomas</span>  (1813&#150;1899), <span class="occ">temperance reformer</span>, was born on 22 August 1813 near Grindleton, Yorkshire, one of nine children of a tenant farmer. He spent his early years at Clitheroe, where the hell-fire preaching at the Wesleyan chapel made a vivid impression on his imagination, and at the age of six he was sent to work in a local cotton factory. A few years later the family moved to Blackburn and then to Preston, where Whittaker received a little formal education at a night school run by Joseph Livesey (1794&#150;1884), a founder of the teetotal movement. When he was fourteen a drinking incident spoiled Whittaker's prospects in Preston, precipitating a move to Bolton and then to Glossop. At Glossop, aged nineteen, he married, and soon after established his own home.<br>
<br>A few years later, in 1835, Whittaker was involved in a drunken brawl, and he returned to Blackburn, unemployed and temporarily unemployable on account of a shoulder injury. The death of his first child at this point triggered an emotional crisis which formed the background to his signing a pledge of total abstinence at a teetotal meeting the same year. He subsequently renewed his religious commitment, undertook a programme of self-education, and became involved with neighbourhood temperance work. He was invited by Livesey to become a full-time temperance missionary, and, during 1835&#150;6, itinerated throughout Lancashire, Westmorland, Cumberland, Northumberland, and Durham as an agent of the British Association for the Promotion of Temperance. At Holme in Cumberland he acquired what was to become his trademark: a rattle which he used to attract attention when making announcements of teetotal meetings.<br>
<br>In 1837 Whittaker visited London, where, following addresses at Kennington and at Exeter Hall on 20 and 21 May, he was engaged as an agent by the New British and Foreign Society for the Suppression of Intemperance (a London-based national organization which changed its name the following year to the New British and Foreign Temperance Society), a post he held until 1849. During this period he promoted the cause of total abstinence in the capital, the eastern counties, and the west of England. In London Whittaker became a member of the Spitalfields chapel of the Revd Robert Aitkin, the maverick Anglican millenarian preacher who was associated with Methodism in the 1830s. There he met Louisa (1810&#150;1875), the daughter of James Palmer, a coachman, whom he married on 6 August 1838 (his first wife had died in 1837).<br>
<br>In 1849 Whittaker and his wife moved to Scarborough, where he became involved in local politics and journalism. He was often on the Liberal Party's platform, but he failed to gain election to the town council until 1867. He was defeated in the 1873 election, but at a by-election in 1876 he regained a seat which he held until his retirement in November 1884. He was mayor of Scarborough during 1880&#150;81, and was made a JP while in office. His connection with the press began with the establishment of <span class="italic">The Express</span> in 1865, and in 1868 he founded <span class="italic">The Watchman</span>. In 1877 he acquired an interest in the <span class="italic">Scarborough Mercury</span>, to which he contributed comments on local affairs for many years.<br>
<br>Whittaker remained committed to the cause of temperance. He was present at the inaugural meeting of the prohibitionist United Kingdom Alliance in 1853, and he attended all its annual meetings except in 1875, when he visited the United States. In the 1880s, the age of &#145;gospel temperance&#146;, Whittaker was concerned to refute charges that the pioneers of teetotalism had been irreligious.<br>
<br>Louisa Whittaker died on 9 January 1875, having borne six children, three of whom died in infancy. Whittaker remarried in 1880; this marriage produced three children. His third wife died in 1898, and Whittaker himself died at his home, at 1 Belgrave Terrace, Scarborough, on 20 November 1899, following a bout of bronchitis. A funeral service held on 23 November at Westborough Wesleyan church was attended by representatives of temperance organizations from all over the country. Whittaker was buried in Scarborough cemetery.<br>
<br>Whittaker published two autobiographical works, <span class="italic">Life's Battles in Temperance Armour</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">Brighter England and the Way to it</span> (1891), the title of which was a word play on William Booth's <span class="italic">In Darkest England</span> (1890). His life has been characterized by Brian Harrison as epitomizing the temperance movement's &#145;resolute encouragement of working-class self-respect and self-realization&#146;  (Harrison, 27). Whittaker was markedly influenced by Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and George Combe's <span class="italic">Constitution of Man</span> (1828). He placed great emphasis on the laws of nature, which he believed governed both the physical and the moral aspects of life. He was a very popular orator, and his broad dialect and successful blend of wit and common sense appealed especially to working-class audiences.<br>
