<span class="headword">Smith <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Johnson]</span>,  Cornelia Estelle <span class="st"> [Connie]</span></span>  (1875&#150;1970), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer and actress</span>, was born on 29 April 1875 in South Carolina, USA, the daughter of Matthew and Letta Johnson. While she was still young the family moved to Brooklyn, New York. In 1894 she left Brooklyn to tour Germany and Denmark in a stage production of <span class="italic">The South before the War</span>. It was during the tour that she met Levi Augustus (Gus) Smith (1864/5&#150;1927), a pianist and variety artist from Philadelphia. In 1895 they travelled to Britain, where they were booked to appear at the Alhambra Theatre in Hull. Billing themselves as Smith and Johnson, they found work in music halls and their piano duets claimed encore after encore. In 1902 a critic described them as &#145;duettists and cake-walkers who give their amusing turn to appreciative applause&#146; at Sheffield's Grand Theatre of Varieties  (<span class="italic">Encore</span>, 23 Jan 1902). On 1 May the same year, at St Francis Xavier's Roman Catholic Church in Everton, Smith and Johnson married.<br>
<br>In Edwardian Britain black entertainers were still looked upon as novelties, and in some parts of the country many people had never seen a black person. There was much pointing and staring, but Connie Smith later recalled, &#145;We never had any sort of insult or suffered any indignity from the British&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flamingo</span>, April 1962, 42). In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, as American citizens Connie and Gus Smith were offered their fares home, but they declined. Britain became their adopted home, and Connie never saw America again.<br>
<br>After the death of her husband in January 1927 Connie Smith was heartbroken but continued working. Later that year she portrayed Aunt Chloe in a special prologue staged at the London Pavilion in Piccadilly Circus before the screening of the silent film <span class="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span>. In 1928 she returned to the London Pavilion to take part in a charity concert described as &#145;the greatest all-star coloured show ever staged&#146;, organized to raise money for the victims of flooding caused by the swollen River Thames. The lyricist Oscar Hammerstein and the composer Jerome Kern were in the audience, taking notes for the casting of their forthcoming production of <span class="italic">Show Boat</span> at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Connie Smith was invited to understudy Alberta Hunter as Queenie, and sing with the Mississippi Chorus, backing Paul Robeson.<br>
<br>In the 1940s, by now well known among agents, producers, and playwrights, Connie Smith made a successful transition from music-hall player to character actress. Whenever there was a part for an older black woman she was considered. Her earliest dramatic roles included Addie in the West End stage version of Lillian Hellman's <span class="italic">The Little Foxes</span> (Piccadilly, 1942). In 1946 she became one of the first black actresses to appear on British television when she portrayed Mrs Harris in Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">All God's Chillun' Got Wings</span>, transmitted live by the BBC from Alexandra Palace. Also in the cast, playing her daughter, was Pauline Henriques, who later recalled:<blockquote>On stage and screen Connie had a presence, even though she was very small and very quiet. I would say Connie was the first black professional in the theatre that I ever met. She would be on time for rehearsals and she never missed a cue. However tiny the part was, she studied it meticulously. Connie was always encouraging to younger actors, especially those of us who were black. I recognised that she had something very few black actors have had&#151;enormous experience. (Bourne, 15)</blockquote>After the Second World War Connie Smith found herself more in demand than ever. In 1956 she became a member of the distinguished English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre. Her roles included the sorceress Tituba in Arthur Miller's <span class="italic">The Crucible</span> (1956) and Granny in Barry Reckord's <span class="italic">Flesh to a Tiger</span> (1958). In 1961 she made her last stage appearance in a German production of Eugene O'Neill's <span class="italic">The Emperor Jones</span>, learning to cope with a foreign language at the age of eighty-six. She died on 11 May 1970 at St Peter's House, a Catholic nursing home in Meadow Road, Lambeth, London, and was buried in the variety artistes' section of Streatham Park cemetery.<br>
