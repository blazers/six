<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Callaghan,  John Cornelius</span>  (1805&#150;1883), <span class="occ">journalist and historian</span>, was born at Dublin, the son of John O'Callaghan, one of the first Catholics allowed to practise law in Ireland after the partial relaxation of the penal laws in 1793. He was educated at the Jesuit school of Clongowes Wood, co. Kildare, and afterwards at a private school at Blanchardstown, near Dublin. He was called to the Irish bar in 1829 but, preferring to pursue a literary career, did not practise. From 1831 to 1833 he contributed to <span class="italic">The Comet</span>, a weekly newspaper published in Dublin by the influential Comet Club. This paper, to which Daniel O'Connell also contributed, advocated the disestablishment of the Church of England in Ireland. When <span class="italic">The Comet</span> ceased publication, O'Callaghan wrote for the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly Magazine</span>. His pieces in these two journals, along with other writings, were collected and published as <span class="italic">The Green Book, or, Gleanings from the Writing Desk of a Literary Agitator</span> (1840). When the Dublin <span class="italic">Nation</span> was started in 1842 as the organ of the Young Ireland party, O'Callaghan joined the staff and he became an important contributor. The first number of the paper contained, under the pen name Gracchus, his poem &#145;The Exterminator's Song&#146;, subsequently republished in <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Nation</span> (1845), a collection of the poetry of the Young Irelanders.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan was best known as a historical writer and editor. In 1846 he published in Dublin for the Irish Archaeological Society an annotated edition of <span class="italic">Macariae excidium, or, The Destruction of Cyprus</span>. This was a history, using disguised names, of the Williamite war of 1688&#150;91, written in 1692 by Colonel Charles O'Kelly, an officer in James II's army. O'Callaghan's masterpiece, <span class="italic">History of the Irish brigades in the service of France, from the revolution in Great Britain and Ireland under James II to the revolution in France under Louis XVI</span>, was the result of over twenty-five years' research. It was published in Glasgow in 1870, after O'Callaghan failed to interest a Dublin publisher. Superseding an earlier work by Matthew O'Conor, this carefully researched if prolix study became a standard source. O'Callaghan also wrote <span class="italic">The Irish in the English Army and Navy</span> (1843). As a writer he was verbose and addicted to an ornate style modelled upon the French Romantic historians whom he admired. But he was also an accurate, objective, fair, and thorough scholar, who painstakingly verified and critically evaluated his sources.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan was keenly interested in Irish politics. He was a member of Daniel O'Connell's Loyal National Repeal Association, for which he designed a membership card in 1843. At one of O'Connell's &#145;monster meetings&#146; in 1840 at Tara Hill, the crowning-place of ancient Irish kings, O'Callaghan and the sculptor John Hogan placed a laurel crown on the head of the &#145;Liberator&#146;. Although attracted to the more radical Young Ireland party, O'Callaghan remained an admirer of O'Connell, who had aided his historical research.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan died at his home, 15 Belvidere Place, Dublin, on 23 April 1883. Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, a colleague in Young Ireland, described him as tall, strong, and loud-voiced.<br>
