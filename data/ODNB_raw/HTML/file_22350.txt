<span class="headword">Plampin,  Robert</span>  (1762&#150;1834), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the son of John Plampin, of Chadacre Hall, Suffolk, entered the navy in September 1775 on the <i>Renown</i>, with Captain Francis Banks. He was actively engaged on the coast of North America during the opening years of the American War of Independence, but after the death of Banks, in January 1778 he returned to England. That July he went to join the <i>Panther</i> at Gibraltar. In February 1780 he was taken by Sir George Rodney into the <i>Sandwich</i>, and was present in the actions of 17 April, and 15 and 19 May. On 4 July that year he was appointed by Rodney acting lieutenant of the <i>Grafton</i>, and, having returned to England in the autumn of 1781, passed his examination on 15 November and was confirmed lieutenant on 3 December. During the rest of the war he was on the Newfoundland station in the <i>Leocadia</i>, which was paid off at the peace; Plampin was placed on half pay. In 1786 he went to France to study French and in 1787 to the Netherlands to learn Dutch.<br>
<br>During the armament of 1790 Plampin was second lieutenant of the <i>Brunswick</i> with Sir Hyde Parker, at whose recommendation, based on his knowledge of the language and country, he was appointed in 1793 to a command in the squadron of gunboats equipping at Rotterdam for the defence of Willemstad, then besieged by the French under Dumouriez. When the siege was raised and the enemy retired from the country the gunboats were dismantled, and Plampin, after returning to England, joined the <i>Princess Royal</i>, on whose books he had been borne while with the Dutch gunboats. He received in 1793 from the states general a gold medal and chain.<br>
<br>In the <i>Princess Royal</i> Plampin went out to the Mediterranean, and on the occupation of Toulon was appointed interpreter to the governor, Rear-Admiral Samuel Granston Goodall, and afterwards to Lord Hood, the commander-in-chief. On the evacuation of Toulon, Hood promoted him commander, dated back to 30 August, and sent him home with dispatches. In February 1794 Plampin was appointed to the sloop <i>Albion</i> for service in the Scheldt, and that summer was moved to the gun-vessel <i>Firm</i>, in command of a flotilla of gunboats in the Scheldt, until they were driven out by the ice. On 21 April 1795 he was posted to the frigate <i>Ariadne</i> (26 guns), in the Mediterranean; at the beginning of July he was ordered to join the squadron under Nelson in the Gulf of Genoa. On the way he encountered the French fleet, and warned the admiral that the enemy were at sea. In September he was moved into the <i>Lowestoft</i> (32 guns), which, on 7 February 1796, off Toulon, was struck by lightning and dismasted. After a partial refit she was sent home with convoy and paid off.<br>
<br>In November 1798 Plampin again commissioned the <i>Lowestoft</i>, and went to the West Indies in charge of a large convoy. In July 1801 he was ordered to convoy the trade to England, but, going through the Windward passage, was wrecked on the night of 10 August. The next morning he ordered the convoy to proceed in charge of the <i>Acasta</i>, leaving the <i>Bonetta</i> to assist in saving the crew of the <i>Lowestoft</i> and two of the merchant ships lost at the same time. After three or four days' great exertion everyone was got safely on board the <i>Bonetta</i>, together with specie from the <i>Lowestoft</i>. The merchants acknowledged the service by paying the freight for the treasure as if it had been carried to England. A court martial acquitted Plampin on the loss of the ship, and he returned to England in the <i>Endymion</i>.<br>
<br>On the renewal of the war in 1803 Plampin was appointed to the <i>Antelope</i> (50 guns), from which, in the autumn of 1805, he was moved into the <i>Powerful</i> (74 guns) and sailed under the orders of Sir John Thomas Duckworth, too late to take part in the battle of Trafalgar. Duckworth detached the <i>Powerful</i> as a reinforcement to the East India squadron, and she had scarcely come on the station before, on 13 June 1806, she captured the French privateer <i>Henriette</i> off Trincomalee. Learning from her that a very fast and successful cruiser, the <i>Bellone</i> (34 guns), a serious threat to British trade, was also on the coast, Plampin disguised the <i>Powerful</i> as an East Indiaman, and, with the sloop <i>Rattlesnake</i>, captured her also on 9 July. She had won such a reputation in the former war that the merchants at Lloyd's had offered a reward of &pound;10,000 for her capture, but the offer had lapsed at the peace of Amiens and not been renewed.<br>
<br>In the autumn the <i>Powerful</i> was with Sir Edward Pellew on the coast of Java, and, after an independent cruise eastwards, returned to Trincomalee very sickly; Plampin himself was so ill that he was compelled to take sick leave. In 1809 he commanded the <i>Courageux</i> (74 guns) in the Walcheren expedition, in 1810 the <i>Gibraltar</i> (80 guns) as senior officer in Basque Roads, and from 1812 to 1814 the <i>Ocean</i> (98 guns) off Toulon, under the orders of Pellew. On 4 June 1814 he was promoted rear-admiral, and in November 1816 he was appointed commander-in-chief on the Cape of Good Hope and St Helena station, where he relieved Sir Pulteney Malcolm. Some interesting reports of his conversations with Napoleon were given by Ralfe in <span class="italic">The Naval Biography of Great Britain</span>.<br>
<br>On his return to England in September 1820, Plampin applied directly (a method later forbidden) for the KCB for his services at St Helena, but was told by Lord Melville that, creditable as his conduct had been, the appointment as KCB could not be made except for services against the enemy. In March 1825 he was appointed commander-in-chief on the Irish station, a post he was specially allowed to retain for the customary term of three years, notwithstanding his promotion, on 27 May 1825, to the rank of vice-admiral. He died at Florence, Italy, on 14 February 1834 and was buried in Wanstead churchyard, Essex, in which county he had owned much land. He was married, but he and his wife had no children.<br>
