<span class="headword">Leadbetter,  Stiff</span>  (<em>c.</em>1705&#150;1766), <span class="occ">architect and builder</span>, was possibly the eldest son of William Leadbetter (<i>fl</i>. 1705&#150;1715), a tailor at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He rose from humble origins to be one of the most successful architect&#150;builders of the 1750s and 1760s, working for many leading aristocratic families. Apprenticed in 1719 as a carpenter for the modest sum of &pound;5 to Henry Leadbetter of Sherfield-on-Loddon, Hampshire, Leadbetter worked as a journeyman carpenter in the 1720s and 1730s. By the 1740s he was employed as a builder in his own right; in the 1750s and 1760s he was responsible for a steady stream of new country houses, hospitals, and speculative urban development, along with alterations and mundane surveying work. He was so busy at the peak of his career in 1759 that he had to turn work away.<br>
<br>Although in the 1750s and 1760s Leadbetter designed most of the buildings for which he was responsible, his principal activity was as a builder. He also carried out the designs of other architects, including Robert Adam and James Stuart, principally decorative work in shells which he had designed and built. He was an innovative and possibly influential planner at a time when the design of the British country house was undergoing rapid change. His country houses, though plain in their interior and external detail, are imaginative, varied, and above all practical in their planning. Although he was not a leader in stylistic development, Elvills, Surrey (1758&#150;63), was the first completely new house of the Georgian Gothic revival.<br>
<br>Most of Leadbetter's commissions were either centred around Eton or can be explained through a network of closely allied aristocratic families. Leadbetter had settled at Eton by 1731; he acted as carpenter to Eton College from 1740 and leased the Eton College wharf, his principal home and workshop, from 1744. Many of his buildings can be found within 5 miles of Eton, an area popular for suburban villas. Others can be traced through family links, particularly to his patron Francis Godolphin, second earl of Godolphin. Through Godolphin, Leadbetter gained work from the dukes of Portland, Marlborough, and Bedford, the countesses of Essex and Pomfret, Lord Foley, Admiral Boscawen, Sir John Elvill, and others. Leadbetter also had a network of ecclesiastical patrons thanks to his position (from 1756) as surveyor of St Paul's Cathedral, to which he was appointed by the dean, Thomas Secker, later Archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1731 Leadbetter married Elizabeth Hill (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1709), daughter of a London timber merchant; she predeceased him in 1737, as did four of their five children, leaving only their eldest son, Henry. Leadbetter died at his house at Eton College wharf on 18 August 1766. He had raised himself to a position of respectability, being described at the time of his death as &#145;Stiff Leadbetter, gent&#146;. A trustee of the Eton parish almshouses and treasurer of the Colnbrook turnpike trust, he died worth over &pound;3000, with leases of four houses in Eton, a house and workshop in Berwick Street, Soho, London, and Spencer's Farm, near Cookham in Berkshire, which he appears to have used as an occasional retreat.<br>
