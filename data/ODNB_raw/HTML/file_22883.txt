<span class="headword">Puller,  Timothy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1637/8, <em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 17 January 1637 or 1638 at the parish of All Saints, Hertford, the eldest of five children of Isaac Puller (<i>bap</i>. 1612, <i>d</i>. in or before 1693) and his wife, Elizabeth Barber, daughter of Gabriel Barber of Hertford. He came from a family with puritan and parliamentarian sympathies. The conformist vicar of All Saints was deprived of his living by the House of Commons in 1642 because he had refused to admit Timothy's grandfather Abraham as lecturer there. Timothy's father was joint author of the account sent to the Derby House committee of the taking of the earl of Holland at St Neots after the failure of his attempt to raise a force for the king, and served as JP and trier in Hertfordshire and as MP for Hertford in all three protectorate parliaments.<br>
<br>Timothy Puller was admitted pensioner and matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1653, graduating BA in 1657 and MA in 1660 (in which degree he was incorporated at Oxford on 9 July 1661); he proceeded BD in 1667 and DD in 1673. On 12 February 1658 he was admitted student of Gray's Inn, but any intention he may have had to take up the law was soon abandoned: elected a fellow of his college in that year, he remained on the fellowship until 1673. He was ordained priest by the bishop of Ely on 24 September 1664; he is recorded as preaching a funeral sermon at All Saints', Cambridge, in April 1668. On 11 July 1671 he was presented to the rectory of Sacombe, Hertfordshire, to which was added on 23 September 1679 the rectory of St Mary-le-Bow, London: both these livings he held to his death. On 23 December 1676 he took out a licence to marry Alice Codrington (<i>bap</i>. 1646, <i>d</i>. 1723?), spinster, then of Kingston, Surrey, the daughter of William Codrington, citizen and draper of London. They were married in King Henry VII's chapel at Westminster Abbey five days later.<br>
<br>Puller was the author of <span class="italic">The Moderation of the Church of England</span> (1679). In this work he argued that no further measures to comprehend dissenters within the Church of England were necessary as the Anglican church already offered a middle way between popery and puritanism. He believed that royal indulgences had been offered to dissenters not because the constitution of the church was oppressive but out of consideration &#145;of the weakness of the people&#146;  (T. Puller, 29). In fact, because of the intransigence of the dissenters he felt that the censures of the church should be imposed &#145;in full and free vigour for their seasonable reducement and emendation&#146;  (ibid., 520). None the less the work remained a popular statement of Anglican theology and was reprinted several times in the nineteenth century. A book whose frontispiece showed the Church of England as the mother church threatened by popish traitors (Guy Fawkes guided by a Jesuit), by puritans who tore and trampled upon the liturgy and <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and by Jesuit wolves in sheep's clothing was appropriated by a rather different tradition of what constituted the Anglican <i>via media</i> as &#145;a calm and argumentative statement of the views of the church as conclusively set forth in her liturgy, articles and homilies&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Puller died in his parish of St Mary-le-Bow, where he was buried on 27 November 1693. His will, made on 9 October 1693 and proved by his widow on 23 January 1694, made provision for her and their two sons, William and Timothy, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary. Puller bequeathed property in Rugeley, Staffordshire, Tottenham High Cross, Middlesex, and Shrewsbury which was to pass to his sons after the death of their mother, while the daughters were to be provided with marriage portions of &pound;400 apiece. His parishes of Sacombe and St Mary-le-Bow each received 40<i>s</i>. for their poor. Puller's widow is probably the Alice Puller whose body was taken from St Paul's, Shadwell, to be buried at St Mary-le-Bow on 25 September 1723. His younger son, Timothy, followed him to the grave four years later; his elder son, William, graduated BCL from Hart Hall, Oxford, on 29 November 1704, aged eighteen, and was presented to the rectory of Yattendon, Berkshire, which he held until his death.<br>
