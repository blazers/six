<span class="headword">Corbaux,  Marie Fran&ccedil;oise Catherine Doetter <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (1812&#150;1883), <span class="occ">painter and biblical critic</span>, was the daughter of the statistician and mathematician Francis Corbaux FRS (<i>c</i>.1769&#150;1843), an Englishman who lived much abroad. Her sister, Louisa Corbaux (<i>b</i>. 1808), was also an artist. In 1827 her father's health was affected by financial losses and she immediately turned her early artistic talent to lucrative purpose. As women were not admitted to the Royal Academy Schools at this time (an exclusion which she campaigned to remove), and probably lacking funds for a private master, she taught herself by copying works in the National Gallery and the British Institution. She exhibited forty-eight works at the Society of British Artists (1828&#150;40), eighty-six at the Royal Academy (1829&#150;54), fifteen at the British Institution (1830&#150;41), seven at the Royal Manchester Institution (1830&#150;45), twenty-one at the Liverpool Academy (1832&#150;54) and thirty-eight at the New Society of Painters in Water-Colour (1832&#150;54); she was also represented by two works at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1855. Most of her paintings were miniature portraits&#151;on which she relied initially for her living&#151;and larger figure compositions in watercolour. In the latter she favoured female subjects and, specifically, during the 1830s and early 1840s, literary heroines in emotional scenes from the works of Shakespeare, Scott, Byron, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Felicia Hemans, and Caroline Norton.<br>
<br>In the late 1840s and early 1850s Corbaux turned increasingly to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as a source, depicting Naomi, Ruth, Leah, Rachel, Hagar, Hannah, and Miriam. The <span class="roman">Bible</span> was also the subject of her contributions to periodicals during this period. One series, called &#145;Letters on the physical geography of the Exodus&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and another, &#145;The Rephaim&#146;, giving the history of this nation, in the <span class="italic">Journal of Sacred Literature</span>. In addition she wrote an introduction to <span class="italic">The Exodus Papyri</span> (1855) by D. I. Heath.<br>
<br>Recognition came early: between 1827 and 1830 Corbaux was awarded five medals by the Society of Arts, including the large silver medal (1827) and the gold Isis medal (1830) for original miniature portraits, and the large silver Isis medal for an original historical composition in watercolour (1829). She was elected an honorary member of the Society of British Artists in 1830 and a member of the New Society of Painters in Water-Colour in 1839. A number of her pictures were engraved: for <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> (1834, 1839, 1844), <span class="italic">Heath's New Gallery of British Engravings</span> by C. Heath (1846) and <span class="italic">Heath's Book of Beauty</span> (1843), and for the almanac <span class="italic">Eml&eacute;ny</span> (1839), published in Budapest. In addition she designed the illustrations in <span class="italic">Finden's Byron Beauties</span> (1836), Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">Pearls of the East, or, Beauties from Lalla Rookh</span> (1837), and J. C. von Schmid's <span class="italic">Cousin Natalia's Tales</span> (1841). She herself lithographed her portrait of the opera singer Emma Albertazzi (exh. Society of British Artists, 1838; impression British Museum, London). Her exhibits were regularly mentioned in periodicals such as <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> and the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. In 1837 <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> commented that:<blockquote>Miss Corbaux is one of the first paintresses of the day: she excels both in oil and watercolours, and her power in watercolour painting especially is very great: she designs with taste and skill, paints with great depth and brilliancy of colouring, and has a truly intellectual feeling for her art. (18 Feb 1837, 164)</blockquote>In 1871 she received a civil-list pension of &pound;50.<br>
<br>Corbaux and her sister, Louisa, often exhibited from the same London addresses: from 5 Hercules Buildings, Lambeth, between 1828 and 1837, and from 59 Upper Norton Street, Portland Place, between 1839 and 1851. After a long illness she died, unmarried, at her home, 2 Lansdowne Terrace, East Hove, Sussex, on 1 February 1883.<br>
