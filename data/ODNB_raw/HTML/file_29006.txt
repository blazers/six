<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wellesley,  Henry Richard Charles</span>, first Earl Cowley  (1804&#150;1884), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in Hertford Street, Mayfair, Westminster, on 17 June 1804, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29004/', "Henry Wellesley, first Baron Cowley (1773&#150;1847)")</script>, and his first wife, Charlotte Cadogan (1781&#150;1853), daughter of the first Earl Cadogan. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29003/', "Gerald Valerian Wellesley")</script> was his younger brother; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21105/', "Lord Clarence Paget")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21109/', "Lord George Paget")</script> were his half-brothers. His father was a diplomatist of note, ambassador at Vienna and, twice, at Paris. Educated at Eton College (1817&#150;20) and Brasenose College, Oxford (where he matriculated in January 1822), Wellesley left the university without taking his degree to be an unpaid attach&eacute; at the Viennese embassy, then headed by his father. He was promoted paid attach&eacute; at The Hague in 1829 and secretary of legation at Stuttgart in 1832, and married on 23 October 1833 the Hon. Olivia Cecilia (1807&#150;1885), daughter of Charlotte, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness de Ros, and her husband, Lord Henry Fitzgerald. They had three sons and two daughters. His wife's good looks and social gifts were to make her a notable ambassadress. From the diplomatic backwater of W&uuml;rttemberg, Wellesley eventually went to Constantinople (1843) as secretary of embassy, and served as minister <i>ad interim</i> in 1846&#150;8. On his father's death in 1847, he succeeded to his peerage, and in February 1848 was appointed minister to Switzerland.<br>
<br>Although Cowley's politics were tory and he remained a member of the Carlton Club to his death, his career flourished under Liberal foreign secretaries. He was also a favourite at court, trusted, unlike his Liberal masters, by Queen Victoria and her dominant husband, Prince Albert. These connections notwithstanding, he proved himself a serviceable instrument of Palmerstonian policy. He did not take up his post at Bern, but proceeded instead on a special mission to observe the Frankfurt parliament's constitution-making for a liberal Germany. After the parliament's dissolution, and the defeat of the hopes it embodied, he became minister at Frankfurt to the old Germanic confederation (June 1851); a CB since 1848, he was made KCB (1 March 1851). In the following February Lord Granville chose him to succeed Lord Normanby at the Paris embassy; Palmerston had previously suggested him for St Petersburg, but Paris was a surprising promotion for a career diplomat without an established reputation.<br>
<br>The Bonapartist restoration in France in the person of Louis Napoleon as president and, from December 1852, as Emperor Napoleon III was an event of tremendous importance. Handing over the Foreign Office to Lord Malmesbury in 1859, Lord Clarendon told him that &#145;the chief employment of the foreign secretary was to make bridges for the Emperor of the French&#146;  (Martin, 4.406). Cowley made himself indispensable in that context, helped by the fact that Napoleon III was an Anglophile, and Franco-British relations were central to his domestic as well as his foreign policy. He declared that his long-term aim was the gradual liberalization of the imperial dictatorship until it bore some resemblance to a parliamentary monarchy &#145;&agrave; l'anglaise&#146;. Although by no means pro-British in other respects, educated opinion in France tended to measure his internal achievements by British standards of personal and political freedom. At the same time the expansion of French power in continental Europe, dictated by the Bonapartist legend, needed Britain to abstain from making the coalitions faced by the first Napoleon. Cowley's dispatches and correspondence depict the complementary themes of French and British policy as Palmerston, above all, exploited the emperor's inclinations and his needs for British purposes.<br>
<br>A typical Englishman of his class and time in his bearing and outlook, although quite at home in a cosmopolitan world, Cowley was close to Napoleon by the time the Crimean War broke out. &#145;I am not generally of a confiding character in regard to foreigners&#146;, he wrote a little later, &#145;but there is something about that man that always imbues me with a feeling of his sincerity&#146;  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 93). Nevertheless, he was acutely sensitive to the ambiguities and contradictions of the man and his policies: the emperor was &#145;the sole depositary of his intentions&#146;  (Wellesley, 3). While the cynicism and corruption of the regime appalled Cowley&#151;&#145;the jobbery &hellip; amongst the Emperor's entourage exceeds all belief&#146;  (ibid., 110)&#151;he was susceptible to Napoleon's appeals in their conversations for British tolerance and understanding of his problems as ruler of France. His authoritarian rule would change its nature once &#145;time and a settled government&#146; had done their work: &#145;I cannot say what an impression his words and manner &hellip; made upon me&#146;, reported the ambassador  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 117). Cowley responded to Napoleon's candour in private: &#145;there is a great charm in doing business with him, even when we do not agree&#146;  (ibid., 120). He was sympathetic to constantly reiterated complaints of British press hostility, accompanied as those imperial remonstrances were by reminders of what the French alliance was worth in great power politics. Cowley exemplified his countrymen's gratitude to Napoleon for having tamed the revolutionary France of 1848, &#145;not only a terror to herself but to all civilized governments&#146;  (Wellesley, 2&#150;3).<br>
<br>Cowley's diplomatic successes were concentrated in the 1850s. The influence he then enjoyed with the emperor was instrumental in persuading him to reject the terms of peace brokered by Austria in the spring of 1855, when the Crimean campaign was not going well for Britain and France. Cowley enlisted the support of the French war minister against the foreign minister, Drouyn de Lhuys. The three argued in the emperor's presence: &#145;the decision lay with Napoleon and depended on whether Drouyn or Cowley would possess his soul&#146;  (Schroeder, 277). The latter prevailed, and determined the outcome of the war: without the deployment of France's large conscript army the Crimean operations could not have been sustained. Cowley had pressed the government to see that Napoleon, always conscious of being a parvenu among monarchs, received the highest honour in the queen's gift, although Prince Albert shuddered at the mere thought: &#145;Sebastopol is well worth the Garter&#146;  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 62). Once Sevastopol was taken in September 1855, however, Napoleon's liking for Cowley and respect for his judgement did not prevent him from bringing the war to an end, as the army and public opinion in France desired. As one of Britain's plenipotentiaries at the congress of Paris, Cowley was disappointed with the peace treaty (March 1856), which he considered too favourable to Russia. It was an indication of his standing that ministers brought him over to testify in the Lords that no better terms could have been obtained. A privy councillor from 1852 (2 February) and a GCB (21 February 1853), he declined a step in the peerage at this time, but on 4 April 1857 became Earl Cowley. The earlier refusal, like the wish to retire he expressed in 1855, was prompted by his relative poverty in an expensive post. His plight was eased by &pound;2000 paid annually from secret service money.<br>
<br>Cowley was entrusted with the negotiations, moved from Constantinople to Paris, that ended (March 1857) the Anglo-Persian War begun the year before. Apprised by the French of Russian intrigues to delay a settlement in the hope of embarrassing the Palmerston ministry at Westminster, Cowley indulged in some undiplomatic language to his Russian colleague: &#145;There is nothing like showing contempt for these bears, it brings them to reason sooner than anything&#146;  (Wellesley, 107). He could not take that tone with the emperor when Napoleon seized the opportunity presented by Britain's preoccupation with the Indian mutiny (May 1857) to get his way in the matter of Romanian union, with some sharp practice, after an international conference (Paris, May&#150;August 1858) at which Cowley represented his country. Afraid of losing his privileged position with Napoleon&#151;&#145;Sometimes &hellip; he will barely condescend to speak to me&#146;  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 114)&#151;he warned that the emperor resented Britain's independent diplomacy: &#145;it galls him to see that we do not &hellip; obey his behests&#146;  (ibid., 127).<br>
<br>Against this background, the attempted assassination of Napoleon and his empress in January 1858 by conspirators based in Britain introduced a period of Anglo-French tension that tested Cowley's abilities to the full. The Palmerston ministry fell in February, overturned for proposing legislation on refugee conspirators designed to appease French indignation. The tory foreign secretary in 1858&#150;9, Lord Malmesbury, who relied heavily on the ambassador's advice, pursued for many months a distinctly conciliatory policy towards France, in order to buy time while Britain's navy was strengthened. Victoria and her husband were induced to grace a celebration of French power at the naval base of Cherbourg, flattered by Cowley's assurance that &#145;nothing does the Emperor so much moral good as seeing the Queen and Prince &hellip;&#146;  (Martin, 4.256&#150;7).<br>
<br>Behind Napoleon's own desire for the restoration of the Crimean friendship lay his maturing plans to extrude Austria from Italy. Cowley's toryism was evident in the scepticism with which he contemplated a federal, or a unitary, Italian state. Malmesbury authorized him to approach Palmerston in search of an understanding between the parties to resist, by diplomatic means, the drift to war over Italy  (Wellesley, 173&#150;4). The overture was fruitless, as was Cowley's mission to Vienna in March 1859, frustrated by the emperor's &#145;ambiguous words and dark dealings&#146;  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 164&#150;5). Napoleon was bent on war, and Palmerston on supporting him by an active and friendly diplomacy. But the second Palmerston administration (June 1859) saw renewed strain upon the Anglo-French relationship: Cowley himself could not forgive the emperor for the deceptions that French policy in Italy involved. The realization of Napoleon's duplicity over the French acquisition of Savoy and Nice in 1860 completely disillusioned him: &#145;You will never find me ask you to trust &hellip; him again&#146;, he told Lord John Russell  (ibid., 181). Emperor and ambassador clashed in public at a function in March 1860, when Napoleon's &#145;tone and manner were really offensive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, ed. A. C. Benson, Lord Esher, and G. E. Buckle, 2nd ser., 1926&#150;8, 3.390). Although the queen and foreign secretary approved of his behaviour on this occasion, the British court found Cowley still too ready to make excuses for Napoleon, while Palmerston and Russell felt he was too pro-Austrian. He now carried less weight with Palmerston, and complained, at an important juncture, that for all he knew of the premier's thinking, &#145;I might as well be in California&#146;  (Maxwell, ii). Yet, if he currently predicted that a united Italy would have to resort to military rule in the south, he welcomed the reduction of papal authority and prestige: &#145;If the Pope is driven from Rome &hellip; the blessings to mankind will overrule everything else &hellip;&#146;  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 186).<br>
<br>As both Liberal ministers at home and the emperor recognized, Cowley's first priority was unchanging: the avoidance of dangerous frictions between their two countries. If the technicalities were outside his competence, he helped to negotiate the Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1860 as a contribution to repairing a relationship damaged by the invasion scare of 1859 and by France's annexations. The clumsiness of Russell's language and actions at the Foreign Office was agony to him. After the crude rejection of Napoleon's proposed European congress in 1863 was followed by Britain's humiliating isolation in the Schleswig-Holstein crisis, Cowley was &#145;<i>broken hearted</i>&#146;  (Burghclere, 74). The transformation of his personal finances by the unexpected inheritance of a cousin's estate made him anxious to retire, but on the tories' return to office in 1866 their foreign secretary, Lord Stanley, appealed to him to stay in his post. Before he left in 1867, Cowley did a weak government in London and the Emperor, but particularly the latter, a final service by his part in defusing the politically explosive Franco-Prussian dispute over Luxembourg.<br>
<br>While Cowley lost confidence in the emperor, and consequently influence with him, he had interpreted Bonapartist France and Palmerstonian Britain to each other at critical moments, reminding both that it would be &#145;insane&#146; if they were to come to blows, and cutting British fears of a sudden invasion down to size  (Wellesley, 165; Wellesley and Sencourt, 200&#150;205). No Francophile&#151;he thought the French were not a moral people&#151;he preferred Napoleon III's France to Bismarck's Germany, whose victory over Austria in 1866 he observed with misgiving: &#145;if ever she becomes a naval power, she will give us trouble&#146;  (Wellesley and Sencourt, 303). His large private correspondence is a major source for the diplomatic historian. It shows Cowley for what he was: a pragmatist in the best sense, as little cynical as was possible for someone in his calling; temperate and humane, an often amused and amusing observer, who seldom lost sight of the realities he was there to describe, and to reconcile. Some of the praise he received was not disinterested. The best estimate, perhaps, is Stanley's: &#145;Though not a man of first-rate talent, he knows the country and the people thoroughly, and can be relied on&#146;  (Vincent, 258).<br>
<br>Further honours came to Cowley after his earldom: KG (1866) and DCL from Oxford University (1870). He died at his London house, 20 Albemarle Street, on 15 July 1884, after an uneventful retirement, devoted to his property and the social round, and was buried at Draycot parish church, near Chippenham, on 18 July. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William, Viscount Dangan.<br>
