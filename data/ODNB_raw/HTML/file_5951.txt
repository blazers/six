<span class="headword">Collins,  Samuel</span>  (1619?&#150;1670), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the eldest son of Samuel Collins (<i>d</i>. 1667), vicar of Braintree, Essex. From 1635 Collins was a pensioner at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which he left in 1637 without taking a degree. On 1 June 1639 he matriculated at Leiden University. He then travelled to Montpellier in the company of Thomas Bartholin. On 30 October 1641 Collins took his MD at Padua University; he incorporated it at Oxford in 1652. He travelled to Russia in 1660 as one of Tsar Alexis's physicians, after an invitation had been issued to him by John Hebdon, Alexis's agent abroad. However, on 12 March 1662 Collins petitioned to be allowed to return to England, to settle his affairs following the death of his brother. He returned to England with the embassy of Prince Prozorovsky, who had been sent to congratulate Charles II.<br>
<br>In August 1663 Collins was back in Russia, and in the autumn resumed his duties as a royal physician, a position he shared with a German doctor, Andreas Engelhardt. Despite Collins's prolonged stay in Moscow, there is little information about his professional activities there. His main patient was Tsar Alexis, who suffered from extreme obesity; Collins therefore presented a number of notes about the need for a regular diet and moderation in eating and drinking. On 31 May 1664 Collins submitted a paper on phlebotomy which contained a brief general discourse and gave detailed information about the dates suitable for the operation. In June of that year, he submitted a paper about the properties of tea and coffee, and on 20 January 1665 he gave a discourse on obesity, its consequences, and possible remedies. In April 1665 Collins discoursed on the properties of valerian; and in 1666 he issued several prescriptions for a pregnant woman, paying special attention to the changing needs of her frail physique.<br>
<br>During his time in Moscow, Collins, like all royal physicians, was treating large numbers of nobles, as well as the royal family and courtiers. Like every other physician at court, he had orders to write out his prescriptions for treatment; a considerable number of these have survived. Some are in Latin, although most survive (in the State Archive of Ancient Acts, Moscow) in contemporary Russian translations made by the interpreters of the apothecary chancery, the bureaucratic body that governed all aspects of life and work of every foreign medical practitioner in Russia. During most of Collins's time in Moscow, his personal interpreter was John Tewe, the son of Robert Tewe, an English apothecary in the tsar's employ.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1665 Collins was placed under house arrest and his pay was suspended. The matter appears to have been resolved by December, when the order to continue his pay as usual was issued. His salary was the same as that of Engelhardt and any other senior royal physician in Moscow from the 1620s to the 1680s: 1114 roubles a year. It consisted of two parts: a lump sum of 250 roubles and monthly payments of 72 roubles. In Moscow Collins lived consecutively in three houses, the last of which was slightly further away from the Kremlin, the royal residence, than the previous two. Before his final leave Collins was allowed to sell this house to the treasury and received sables worth 2800 roubles.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1667 Collins petitioned for leave, explaining that his contract, renewed in 1664 after the negotiations with the English ambassador, the earl of Carlisle, was for only three years. As the contract had expired, Collins asked for transport to convey him to the border; he nevertheless offered to act as a procurer of royal medical supplies. Although the order releasing him from service was given on 1 July, the customary commendatory letter, a parting present, and the transport were provided only on 21 July 1667.<br>
<br>Through family connections, and the patronage given to his father by the countess of Warwick, sister of Robert Boyle, Collins became acquainted with Boyle himself. Whether they had met before Collins's departure to Russia is uncertain, but they maintained a long correspondence in which they debated medical matters and exchanged information on diseases and their treatment. Collins also assisted Boyle in his research into the effects of extreme cold on elements and on humans. In 1669 Collins was in England and in a letter to Boyle complained of ill health. He had diagnosed himself as having a &#145;catthar&#146; and scurvy, describing, among other symptoms, the weakening of the gums on his left side. Collins hoped that the warmer climate of France would improve his health and he soon left for Paris, where he died on 26 October 1670. In accordance with his will, a memorial plaque was inserted in Braintree church, Essex, where he was buried.<br>
<br>Collins's only book, <span class="italic">The present state of Russia, in a letter to a friend, written by an eminent person residing at the great tzar's court at Mosco for the space of nine years</span>, was first published in London in 1671. It was published in French in 1679. This book provides an interesting and insightful account of Russian life, although it suffered in part from the improbable anecdotes inserted for the entertainment of the reader, probably by the editors of the book. It is illustrated with a number of copperplates.<br>
