<span class="headword">Atcherley, Sir  Richard Llewellyn Roger</span>  (1904&#150;1970), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born at 1 Mount Vale, York, on 12 January 1904, one of twin sons of Major (later Major-General Sir) Llewellyn William Atcherley (1871&#150;1954) and his wife, Eleanor Frances, the younger daughter of Richard Micklethwait. His father, who divided his career between the army and the police, served between 1919 and 1936 as an inspector of constabulary. The family had lived in Shropshire for many years, and could trace their ancestry to the sixteenth century, when a Sir Richard Atcherley was mayor of London. Atcherley was educated at Oundle School, which he left without any special distinction, but with a burning interest in flying. He and his twin brother, David, were guided towards commerce, but applied on their own initiative for cadetships at the Royal Air Force College. Dick was accepted, but for medical reasons David was turned down; he went instead into the army, but managed to transfer later to the Royal Air Force and rejoin his twin.<br>
<br>From childhood until the end of their lives Atcherley and his twin brother were extraordinarily identical in appearance; their voices, movements, and mannerisms were indistinguishable, and they had an uncanny mental affinity even when far apart. If one was posted abroad they would exchange the dog they owned in common, which was said to be unable to tell one from the other. In this remarkable partnership Dick just tended to be the dominant twin, and his career was the more spectacular. Serving first in fighter squadrons, he quickly proved his worth as an exceptional pilot, and in 1926 was selected as an instructor at the Central Flying School, where he brought aerobatic flying to a new degree of excellence. From this already &eacute;lite assembly he was chosen as a member of the Royal Air Force high speed flight then being assembled for the 1929 Schneider trophy contest. Although he was disqualified during the competition, he set up both a new world speed record and a record for the course, flying a Supermarine seaplane of the type which formed the basis of the design of the Spitfire. In the same year, with Flight Lieutenant Stainforth, he won the king's cup air race. When he returned to squadron duty he was established as one of the world's foremost practical high speed pilots and a master of the art of exhibition flying. For the next few years he was invited to American aviation meetings at Chicago and Cleveland, where his flying performances became increasingly entertaining and hair-raising, including such feats as flying an aircraft while riding it pickaback dressed as a huntsman, or disguising himself as an elderly eccentric with no knowledge of flying and then giving a display whose terrifying craziness concealed his underlying mastery of the machine. It is not surprising that his universal nickname was Batchy.<br>
<br>A period in the Middle East was followed by a posting as a service test pilot, which found Atcherley in his ideal medium. He next attended the Staff College, and some less welcome staff duty brought him to 1939 and war. He soon gained the command of a night fighter squadron, a new branch of operations and one beset with every possible problem, both human and technical. From there he was snatched away to command the air element of the British expeditionary force to north Norway. This short, desperate, and finally disastrous campaign gave full play for his energy, imagination, and powers of improvisation, but chiefly showed his ability to inspire those he commanded to efforts beyond anything they had thought possible. When the last of the British forces was withdrawn Atcherley was promoted group captain and appointed to the command of a night fighter training airfield at Drem in Scotland, where he applied all the lessons so bitterly learned in Norway, and for good measure invented a new system of airfield lighting which was later standardized throughout the service. With his brother commanding another Scottish airfield his creative spirit was at its highest, for the twins reacted on one another like spark and tinder, but their effervescence, unthinkable to most officers of their rank, never diverted them from the relentless pursuit of improvements in every aspect of flying which could lead to greater success in air operations.<br>
<br>In 1942 Atcherley was made sector commander first of Fairwood Common and then of Kenley. From there, while flying a Spitfire, he was shot down into the channel and wounded. In 1943 he was sent to north Africa to command a group in the desert air force, and then returned to the staff of allied expeditionary air forces. There he invented the concept and designed the organization of the Central Fighter Establishment; when the war ended he was serving as its first commandant. He followed this by commanding the Royal Air Force Cadet College (1946&#150;8). In 1949 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the new air force of a new country&#151;Pakistan&#151;whose pilots regarded with mingled awe and hilarity a commander-in-chief who could fly any aircraft they possessed as well as they could, and whose sense of humour still remained outrageous and unpredictable.<br>
<br>In 1951 Atcherley was given the command of 12 fighter group, then in 1954 was sent to the United States as commander RAF staff, British joint services mission. His last appointment (1955&#150;8) was as commander-in-chief Flying Training Command. The years had in no way modified his character, and to the end of his career he managed successfully to combine a uniquely flippant style with an underlying sense of duty so strong that he was unhappy during weekends and holidays, and truly at ease only when working. This made his retirement exceptionally hard to bear, but far worse was the loss of his brother David, posted missing on a jet flight over the Mediterranean in 1952. Although he remained outwardly unaffected, it was the heaviest blow of his life.<br>
<br>Atcherley was awarded the AFC in 1940 and bar in 1942 and was promoted air vice-marshal in 1951 and air marshal in 1956. He was appointed OBE (1941), CBE (1945), CB (1950), and KBE (1956).<br>
<br>What made Atcherley memorable was his character rather than his deeds, and particularly his power to combine brilliance and irreverence so that they became indistinguishable. He and his twin were the type of men whose ability, devotion to duty, and intensity of purpose allowed them to survive and prosper through careers studded with crashes, courts martial, and the type of gaffe which offended the more pompous heads of military and civil life. The great majority of their service loved them deeply; a minority, and a great many civilian officials, heaved a sigh of relief when there were no more Atcherleys in uniform. Dick Atcherley set a style which played a major part in determining the traditions of the youngest fighting service and created a legend which continued to influence it far beyond his actual impact upon events. Thus the future inspiration of the Royal Air Force would always include something of the influence of the Atcherley brothers, far more than that of greater and more important men.<br>
<br>From 1959 to 1961 Atcherley was co-ordinator of Anglo-American community relations, and from 1959 to 1965 served as sales director of the Folland Aircraft Company. He was an early member of the British Interplanetary Society. There is a portrait at the Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, by Herbert Holt, and another much better one of his brother David by Eric Kennington at RAF West Raynham, which serves as well.<br>
<br>Atcherley died at the Cambridge Hospital, Aldershot, Hampshire, on 18 April 1970. Neither brother married.<br>
