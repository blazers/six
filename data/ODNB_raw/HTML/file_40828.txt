<span class="headword">Crawford, Sir  William Smith</span>  (1878&#150;1950), <span class="occ">advertising agent</span>, was born in Glasgow on 17 December 1878, son of Robert Crawford (<i>d</i>. 1916), merchant, wholesaler, and newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. His younger brother Archibald Crawford (1882&#150;1960) became a prominent barrister. He was educated at Lenzie Academy, Blair Lodge, and then in Neuwied am Rhein and Frankfurt am Main. Though unhappy in Germany, he gained an international outlook and linguistic abilities that were crucial to his later success.<br>
<br>On his return to Scotland Crawford worked briefly for his father before joining Lizar's opticians in 1902. In 1903 the job took him to Liverpool, where he struck up a lifelong friendship with George Jones of the Meccano model firm. When Crawford abruptly decided to move to London to pursue a career in advertising, he crucially brought the Meccano account with him. Crawford joined the De Wynter company in 1906 and while working as a space canvasser met and then married, on 30 March 1907, Marion Stewart, daughter of William Whitelaw, doctor of medicine, and sister of the cartoonist George Whitelaw. They had two daughters and one son, (Robert) Stewart Crawford (1913&#150;2002), who went on to pursue a distinguished career in the diplomatic service and to receive a knighthood.<br>
<br>After De Wynters was declared bankrupt in 1910, Crawford went to the Frederick E. Potter agency, where he began to specialize in luxury goods and holidays. Brash, gregarious, and heavily jowled, Crawford won the confidence of several clients, most prominently Herbert Morgan of W. H. Smith. This esteem prompted Crawford to rent two rooms on the Kingsway and set up his own agency in April 1914. Having narrowly survived the war, the firm captured the prestigious W. H. Smith account in 1919, before the International Advertising Exhibition at White City in 1920 stimulated a decade of rapid growth. The exhibition served as a forum for American firms looking to move into the British market, but whereas the majority of British advertising firms became tied into unequal associations with much larger American companies, Crawford invested in offices in Berlin and then Paris with the aim of creating a pan-European operation.<br>
<br>Crawford's internationalist vision was matched by unusual organizational sophistication. He established a market intelligence unit in 1921, and his firm was among the first to abandon the advertising &#145;all-rounder&#146; in favour of specialist copywriters and graphic designers. These staffing arrangements allowed W. H. Crawford Ltd to pursue such innovations as the development of new typefaces and to broaden the practice of advertising into a form of design consultancy. In addition to buying newspaper space, W. H. Crawford Ltd offered to redesign letter-headings, stationery, packaging, and the layout of offices and workspaces.<br>
<br>In 1927 Frederick Etchells encased the firm's new premises at 233 High Holborn in a Le Corbusier-style shell of black marble, concrete, glass, and stainless steel. This much discussed extravagance confirmed Crawford's reputation as a lavish patron of modernism. Although Crawford professed to be following in the footsteps of Frank Pick's sponsorship of modern art on London's public transport system, his largesse was also seemingly part of a calculated plan of tax avoidance. Taken to court by the Inland Revenue, Crawford defended the building's grandeur to the prosecutor, &#145;Sir, is it perhaps necessary for you yourself to dress in your present attire&#151;to create an impression?&#146;  (Havinden, 91).<br>
<br>By the late 1920s Crawford's agency was synonymous with a stark visual idiom. This distinctive style was developed by gifted commercial artists like Ashley Havinden and Terence Prentis, who drew inspiration from European modernism and the work of Edward McKnight Kauffer, the most acclaimed and innovative graphic designer of the inter-war period. Indeed Havinden later persuaded Crawford to recruit Kauffer on a part-time basis and to commission such artists as Jean Cocteau, Eric Gill, and L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy. This was an almost accidental corporate enthusiasm. The general strike of 1926 prompted Crawford to switch his printing work to Germany and Holland and thus further exposed him to the &#145;continental&#146; style. Also influential was the realization that fussy pictorial imagery rarely transcended cultural boundaries or survived the &#145;abominable paper and printing characteristics of most of the foreign newspapers&#146;  (Saxon-Mills, 82). Unlike the idealistic Pick, Crawford had arguably merely made a noisy virtue out of a necessity.<br>
<br>The depression temporarily halted the expansion of American firms in Europe and pushed Crawford towards the public sector. As an adviser to the Empire Marketing Board from 1926 to 1931, Crawford came to exert considerable influence over the board's energetic secretary, Sir Stephen Tallents. Crawford's contribution to the board's promotional campaigns led to his being knighted in 1927. The secretary for the dominions, Leopold Amery, joked that in Crawford's case KBE stood for &#145;Keep Buying Empire&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 June 1927). In 1931 he directed the board's Buy British campaign, which attempted to persuade the public that discriminating shopping could spend the nation out of the slump. A giant neon sign was erected in Trafalgar Square, while the aviator Amy Johnson and the train carriages of the Great Western Railway were also enlisted in the cause.<br>
<br>In 1931 Crawford was appointed chairman of the Post Office publicity committee and, following Tallents's transfer to the General Post Office, played an influential part in the rebranding of the Post Office. This role, coupled with consultancy to the Ministry of Health, the Imperial Economic Committee, and the Ministry of Agriculture, cemented his place in the establishment. Accordingly W. H. Crawford Ltd prospered during the Second World War, when it was responsible for many Ministry of Information campaigns, and in the immediate post-war era, when the British state became the largest advertiser.<br>
<br>William Crawford played an important role in reforming the advertising industry. He was a member of the executive council of the Advertising Association from its foundation in 1926. He was a member of the council of the Association of British Advertising Agents and president of the Institute of Incorporated Practitioners in Advertising (1937&#150;40). Crawford tirelessly wrote guidelines and statements of best practice, and facilitated the creation of regulatory bodies such as the Audit Bureau of Circulation in 1931.<br>
<br>Crawford held an apparently genuine desire to reclaim the profession from the &#145;quacks and charlatans&#146; and made strenuous efforts to raise the status of advertising in public life. He used the World Advertising Convention at Wembley in 1924 to lobby such luminaries as the prince of Wales and Winston Churchill, and repeatedly stressed the importance of advertising to national wellbeing in the columns of the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening News</span> and in books like <span class="italic">How to Succeed in Advertising</span> (1931). Crawford also contributed to a variety of co-operative inter-war campaigns to encourage the consumption of milk and fruit, co-writing <span class="italic">The People's Food</span> (1938) to popularize the claims of nutritional science. He died at his home, 5 Chesterfield House, Audley Street, Westminster, London, on 19 November 1950.<br>
<br>W. S. Crawford Ltd was one of the few British advertising agencies in the early twentieth century with an international reach; by the time of Crawford's death the firm had established a global network of thirty-seven offices. Under his direction the agency was instrumental in importing, appropriating, and developing advertising techniques in Britain. Ironically, although the founder of the modern agency, Crawford was fond of <i>bons mots</i> like &#145;I know nothing about advertising&#146;, &#145;You are not proposing to spend enough money&#146;, and &#145;I warn you that you won't like what I am now going to show you!&#146; It was to Crawford's sixth sense and his &#145;remarkable and in some degree mysterious qualities&#146; that Sir Stephen Tallents paid tribute on his death  (Saxon-Mills, 175). W. S. Crawford Ltd later became part of the Dorland Group and was subsumed into Saatchi and Saatchi in 1987.<br>
