<span class="headword">Koc&#382;wara,  Franti&#353;ek</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1791), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born in Prague about 1750. He seems to have been an itinerant musician in Germany and the Netherlands but had moved to England by 1775. He lived in various places around England; the string quartets (op. 3, 1775) indicate that he lived in Bath, whereas the trios (op. 5) of a year later give a London address. In 1783 he moved to Dublin, where he played violin in the band at the Smock Alley Theatre; he also performed at the Chester music festival in September of that year (presumably on his way to Ireland). While in Ireland he composed perhaps his most popular work, <span class="italic">The Battle of Prague</span> (op. 23, <i>c</i>.1788), and performed for the Irish Musical Fund.<br>
<br>According to Pohl, Koc&#382;wara was engaged to play double bass at the new Italian opera house in London by Giovanni Gallini in 1790, but as that theatre was being rebuilt that year and did not open until March 1791 it is possible that as an interim measure he played for Gallini and Giardini at the Little Haymarket Theatre. He had certainly returned to London by May 1791, as he played in the Concerts of Ancient Music and the Handel commemoration of May 1791. F&eacute;tis claimed to have performed, at the age of eight, a Mozart sonata and Koc&#382;wara's own <span class="italic">Battle of Prague</span> (the latter at sight) for the composer when he visited his father's house in Mons, although his dating of spring 1792 is clearly erroneous. F&eacute;tis also described how Koc&#382;wara played the violin, viola, cello, piano, oboe, flute, bassoon, and cittern.<br>
<br>Koc&#382;wara's compositions are mainly piano works and chamber music for piano and stringed instruments. <span class="italic">The Battle of Prague</span>, a sonata for piano and optional violin and cello, was extremely popular, particularly in Boston, USA, where it was &#145;indispensable to climax every concert&#146;. According to Parke, Koc&#382;wara often sought to pass off his own works as being by more popular (and commercially successful) composers such as Haydn and Pleyel, although Newman decries &#145;the utter banality and triteness of this [<span class="italic">Battle of Prague</span>] sonata&#146;.<br>
<br>Koc&#382;wara is most famous for the manner of his death. Although more polite generations would describe his death merely as suicide, the book <span class="italic">Modern Propensities, or, An Essay on the Art of Strangling</span> (London, <i>c</i>.1792) contained the memoirs of Susannah Hill, the woman tried at the Old Bailey on 16 September 1791 for the composer's murder. At her trial, Hill described how, on 2 September 1791 at a house of ill repute in Vine Street, Covent Garden, Koc&#382;wara had drunk a great deal of brandy and asked to be hanged in order to raise his passion. When she cut him down minutes later he was dead. Although auto-erotic asphyxia was not defined for another two hundred years, the case against Hill was dismissed.<br>
