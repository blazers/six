<span class="headword">Dingley,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1710, <em>d.</em> 1781), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was baptized on 12 September 1710 at St Helen's, Bishopsgate, London, the eldest in the family of two surviving sons and four daughters (there were nineteen children in all) of Robert Dingley (1678&#150;1741), a Bishopsgate jeweller and goldsmith, and his wife, Susanna, daughter of Henry Elkin. In August 1726 Robert Dingley senior, together with Sir Randolph Knipe, shipped exceptionally fine silver table services to Empress Catherine I of Russia and for her favourite, the statesman Prince Menshikov FRS. Made freemen of the Russia Company in August 1731, Robert and his brother Charles traded as partners, with an agency in St Petersburg, where, with other merchants, they financed two sugar refineries. Robert represented the company's interests at the Commons and the Admiralty, becoming its consul and auditor in 1759. He was a director of the Bank of England (1757&#150;67) and of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the earliest of its kind, when it was founded in 1762. A member of the Society of Dilettanti from its foundation (<i>c</i>.1736) he devised an influential plan in February 1749 for a public Academy of Arts, and was also an active fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1734&#150;48). Elected FRS in 1748, he contributed useful items to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on gemstones  (44, 1747)&#151;though harshly criticized by John Hill in 1751&#151;and irregular Thames tides  (49, 1756).<br>
<br>As a philanthropist, Dingley served on a committee of the Merchant Seamen's Corporation (established in 1747), and was a governor and an innovative inspector (1758&#150;62) of the London Foundling Hospital. He pioneered the Magdalen Hospital for Penitent Prostitutes, the first English charity of its kind, founded at Prescot Street, Whitechapel, in 1758, and largely designed its second building, which opened at Southwark in 1772. Its treasurer and then, from 1768, vice-president, he is commemorated by Dingley Lane, SW16. Several of his talented architectural designs exist, including engravings of those for rebuilding the king's and queen's baths at Bath (published by I. and J. Taylor, <i>c</i>.1787). His proposals of 1757 as a fellow of the Society of Arts resulted in premiums being awarded for modelling in various media. His exceptional collection of gemstones, engraved gems, drawings, prints, and natural-history specimens was auctioned by White's on 23 June 1785. His brother Charles Dingley (1711&#150;1769), who projected London's New Road and New City Road (1756&#150;61), received the Society of Arts gold medal in 1768 for building a large sawmill at Limehouse.<br>
<br>Dingley owned a house at Little St Helen's, Bishopsgate. From 1753, when he sold two Sussex farms, until the death in 1759 of his wife, Elizabeth (daughter of Henry Thompson, of Kirby Hall, Yorkshire), whom he had married in 1744, his country home was in Charlton, Kent; he moved to Lamorbey, at Bexley, when he married Esther Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1784) in March 1760. He had a son and two daughters (one of whom died very young) by his first marriage. Dingley died at Lamorbey on 8 August 1781, according to the monumental inscription in Charlton parish church, where he and his wives are buried. His portrait, painted and presented in 1762 by William Hoare to the Magdalen Hospital, was engraved in mezzotint by John Dixon and is in a private collection.<br>
