<span class="headword">Lane, Sir  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1603), <span class="occ">soldier and colonist</span>, was of unknown parentage and education. He ranked in that restless corps of Tudor wanderers who schemed the advance of English interests in Ireland and America even as they chased fortunes for themselves. Nineteenth-century scholars presumed that he came from Horton, Northamptonshire, but those presumptions lack the sanction of unimpeachable evidence. However, it is certain that he acquired a taste for adventure through his experiences of the sea and soldiering. From the 1570s his name appears with some regularity in the correspondence of William Cecil and other crown officers, whom he relentlessly importuned for royal preferment. His persistence paid off, for by the mid-1580s he had received several Irish appointments, including the shrievalty of Kerry; he was also equerry of the queen's great stables. He then caught the attention of Sir Walter Ralegh, who recruited him in 1585 to lead a colonizing enterprise in North America.<br>
<br>A year earlier Ralegh had sent an expedition to seek a site more suitable for settlement than Labrador or Newfoundland, inhospitable places that his predecessors had failed to settle. He planned a second foray to America even before his scouts returned to report their discoveries to him. To that purpose he amassed seven vessels, supplies, and upwards of 300 men, whose company included the mathematician Thomas Harriot and the artist and cartographer John White. Command of the fleet went to Sir Richard Grenville, but once the convoy reached their destination it was Lane who would govern the colony.<br>
<br>The voyagers cast off from Plymouth on 9 April 1585. Their navigator, Sim&atilde;o Fernandes, a Portuguese seafarer and long-time employee of English explorers, steered towards their destination&#151;the coast of modern North Carolina, the place Ralegh styled Virginia in honour of Elizabeth I. Stops in the West Indies gave respite from a storm-tossed crossing and allowed Lane to adapt his skill at fortification to American conditions before the flotilla sailed northwards. In June it reached Wococon, one of the barrier islands that formed the outer ring of Pimlico Sound, and Fernandes carelessly ran his flagship aground. Damage proved minor, though the accident cost dearly because the vessel sprang leaks that spoiled a major part of the colony's provisions. Undaunted by their misfortune, Lane and Grenville explored Pimlico Sound, seeking a suitable place to settle. After many disagreements they chose Roanoke Island, where Lane laid out a fort and supervised the construction of housing even as he wrangled fiercely with Grenville. By the time Grenville sailed homewards in August for more supplies the breach between the two men was unbridgeable, and each attacked the other in letters to their superiors in England. Their quarrels foreshadowed troubles that were to dog the colony to the end of its days.<br>
<br>Part of the difficulty lay with Lane. Vain, boastful, and fiery-tempered, he brooked little opposition. Then, too, being of a military background, he relied more upon arms than diplomacy, and that approach soured his dealings with the natives from the start. Moreover, Lane's men were suited more to fighting than to settling. They were mainly soldiers who had been recruited for wages and plunder instead of being picked for their talents as colonizers. In essence, they were a garrison in occupied territory. Everyone's survival therefore depended upon whatever forage the land and its indigenous people might yield. It was not the native way to stockpile surpluses of foodstuffs as trade goods, and so local tribes had little to spare, even though they eagerly bartered with the English until the supply of beads, bells, and other trinkets played out&#151;as it did by December 1585. Ralegh's provisioners had also neglected to include nets and other fishing equipment, which limited the settlers' chances of partaking of abundant fish stocks. Soldierly skill at shooting did not readily translate into marksmanship that successfully brought down game.<br>
<br>Despite these hardships, Lane kept his men safely through the winter of 1585&#150;6. The experience convinced him that time and diligent work might sustain a colony, but a more permanent settlement needed two things not readily found at Roanoke Island, a snug harbour and vendible commodities of high demand on English markets. In spring 1586 Lane set off to locate both. He discovered the one&#151;extant accounts indicate how he trekked northwards to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay&#151;but he never found the other. Instead, he had to battle the natives for survival.<br>
<br>With Lane gone from Roanoke, the natives plotted the destruction of the governor and the colony. The local chieftain, whose name was Pemisapan, put it about that Lane intended to attack the natives above Roanoke, which stirred them to harass the governor and his foragers. In turn, the chief tried to undermine the guardians of the fort with tales of Lane's death and attempts to coax his own tribe to forsake Roanoke Island and so cause the soldiers to die of starvation. However, Lane fought his way back to the fort and eventually defeated his enemy.<br>
<br>Shortly thereafter a fleet of English ships under Sir Francis Drake appeared. Drake volunteered some much needed supplies and one of his vessels to tide the settlers over until the expected arrival of Ralegh's relief convoy. A great storm blew up amid the transfer of the stores, which drove Drake's fleet out to sea and evidently broke the colonists' resolve to tarry longer. News that England and Spain neared war intensified doubts that Grenville might return any time soon, and Lane was hardly eager to confront him again. All things considered, Lane and his men opted to return to England with Drake.<br>
<br>Barely two days after they all left, a relief ship, which sailed ahead of Grenville's main column, appeared off Roanoke. Finding none of their countrymen, the ship's company turned round and sailed for home. Grenville arrived a few weeks later only to discover a deserted fort and huts that bore signs of hasty abandonment. He scouted the area for a time before leaving a small holding party and enough provisions to keep them for upwards of two years and making for England.<br>
<br>As for Lane, he landed at Portsmouth in July 1586. Thereafter he participated in preparing English coastal defences against a possible Spanish invasion. By the 1590s he was back in Ireland, where he became muster-master-general of the English garrisons and fought rebel Irishmen. Knighted for his services by the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir William Fitzwilliam, Lane lived out his remaining days in Dublin. He died there and was buried in St Patrick's Church on 28 October 1603.<br>
<br>The most notable achievements of the Roanoke expedition were not Lane's. They belonged instead to Thomas Harriot and John White. Harriot's <span class="italic">A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia</span> described Virginia as a real land of plants and animals and people to be exploited by the English. White supplied beautifully accurate drawings of the Carolina flora and fauna, and in the hands of the Dutch engraver Theodor de Bry these became illustrations for multilingual editions of Harriot's volume that de Bry marketed all across Europe. Harriot and White's work also informed the writings of the greatest of all sixteenth-century promoters of English colonization, Richard Hakluyt the younger, whose tireless efforts led to the founding of Jamestown in 1607.<br>
