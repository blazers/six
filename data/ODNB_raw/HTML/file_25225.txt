<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Charles Kirkpatrick</span>  (1781&#150;1851), <span class="occ">antiquary and collector</span>, was born at Hoddam (or Hoddom) near Dumfries on 15 May 1781, the third son and seventh child of Charles Sharpe of Hoddam (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1813) and Eleanora Renton (1748&#150;1836), daughter of John Renton of Lammerton. In February 1796 he went to Edinburgh for his education, and from October in that year he attended Professor John Robison's class at the university. He left Edinburgh in May 1798, and after a short period at home, went up to Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 22 November, before graduating BA on 17 June 1802, and proceeding MA on 28 January 1806. Sharpe's education was to have fitted him for a living in the Church of England, but he seems never to have pursued this line with enthusiasm, perhaps because his high-pitched voice was unsuited to the pulpit. After graduation he divided his time between London, Oxford, and Hoddam, but after the death of his father in 1813 he settled with his mother at the family's house at 93 Princes Street, Edinburgh. After her death in August 1836 he lived for a while at 19 West Nicolson Street until, on his eldest brother's death in February 1845, he succeeded to Hoddam, and moved to 28 Drummond Place. He never married, and does not appear to have left Edinburgh or its immediate vicinity between 1813 and his death at home in Drummond Place on 17 March 1851. He was buried at Hoddam.<br>
<br>Sharpe's significance lies in his antiquarian and other intellectual pursuits. As a child he had listened to ballads and songs in Dumfriesshire. His father had known Burns, though Sharpe's acquaintance seems to have been limited to seeing him at a theatre in Dumfries in October 1792. When Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span> appeared in 1802, Sharpe immediately sent him copies of &#145;The Twa Corbies&#146; and &#145;The Douglas Tragedy&#146;. Scott visited Sharpe in Oxford that year, and though each man was alive to the other's weaknesses (and Sharpe could be extremely unkind about those who tried to help him), they remained on good terms until Scott's death. Scott invited him to collaborate in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, but he refused &#145;not only on account of my profound ignorance respecting modern political transactions, but because my style is at least one hundred good years behind that of most people both in strength and eloquence&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 3876, fol. 155). However he wrote some poetry, and published <span class="italic">Metrical Legends and other Poems</span> in 1807&#151;though, in Scott's words in his <span class="italic">Journal</span>, &#145;as a poet he has not a very strong touch&#146;&#151;and he edited ballads. <span class="italic">A Ballad Book</span> appeared in 1823 and <span class="italic">Surgundo, or, The Valiant Christian</span> in 1837.<br>
<br>In prose Sharpe preferred Richardson and Fielding to Scott, whose writing he criticized on both literary and antiquarian grounds, though later in life he both admired and encouraged Harrison Ainsworth. In 1808 he wrote a play of which Scott approved, and &#145;will certainly endeavour to get it acted&#146;, he wrote to his sister Isabella, &#145;but do not whisper one word of it to any mortal, for if it be damned I must never confess myself the author&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. c. 38, fol. 151). He felt himself secure only on antiquarian subjects, and this is where his literary reputation rests. He edited James Kirkton's <span class="italic">Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland</span> in 1817, with elaborate notes. His introduction to Robert Law's <span class="italic">Memorialls</span> (1818), written at Scott's suggestion and with the use of his library, remains to this day a standard history of witchcraft in Scotland. His editorial work for the Bannatyne Club is of a high quality. His historical interests led him into a number of byways. Witchcraft, female criminality, and historical gossip were supported by an exceptional knowledge of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sources. In his copy of Douglas's <span class="italic">Peerage</span> (1764), now at the Royal Library, Windsor, more than half the entries are corrected or expanded by his annotations. Occasionally these are coloured by his high-tory views and his taste for marital scandal, but for the most part he gives authority for what he says. As a display of learning it is astonishing. This learning was available to anyone who asked for it, including Robert Chambers, for whose <span class="italic">Traditions of Edinburgh</span> (1824&#150;5) he was extremely helpful. He also collaborated with the antiquaries Thomas Thomson and David Laing.<br>
<br>Sharpe was a draughtsman and painter of more than amateur skill. While at Oxford he produced portraits of his contemporaries (mostly in seventeenth-century dress); his drawing of &#145;Queen Elizabeth dancing before Melville&#146; caused &#145;inextinguishable laughter&#146;  (J. G. Lockhart, <span class="italic">Life of Scott</span>, 1882, 3.163) when it was received by Scott in December 1808; and his caricature of Madame de Sta&euml;l, whom he met in London in 1813, is unflatteringly accurate. He subsequently illustrated several Bannatyne Club publications as well as some of his own work. Scott tried unsuccessfully to have him appointed king's limner in Scotland.<br>
<br>Sharpe was also a musician. Like his father, he played the fiddle, and at Oxford took piano lessons. His musical library included early printed works, with material he had inherited from his father, acquired from the Edinburgh Musical Society (including the catalogue of its library of orchestral works), or bought. The emphasis is on Handel and the early eighteenth century, and the collection includes Mrs Crokat's music book (1709) (recorded in Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> as long untraced) and music by the earl of Kellie, a selection of whose <span class="italic">Minuets</span> he published in 1836. He was also a noted collector. While still at Oxford he was given Lely's portrait of the duchess of Portsmouth. In 1802 he told his mother that he must leave his college lodgings. &#145;I shall begin then to pack off my knick knacks for Scotland. &hellip; You will be overwhelmed with swinging great boxes and charmed with my <span class="roman">Nell Gwynn</span> and <span class="roman">Lady Aston</span>&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. c. 38, fol. 25). At his death he owned a very considerable number of portraits, including <span class="italic">Margaret Tudor</span> by Holbein, Hogarth's <span class="italic">Sarah Malcolm</span>, Kneller's <span class="italic">Duchess of Marlborough</span>, and twelve previously in Kellie Castle. He also owned pictures by Breughel, Cranach, Van Eyck, Giorgione, Raeburn, Rembrandt, Reynolds, and Rosa. He acquired, from the hoard of twelfth-century ivory chessmen found around 1830 on Lewis, the eleven pieces now in the Royal Museums of Scotland. He was never a rich man, but he bought with care, and his known taste for historical objects ensured that much was offered to him. His collection was dispersed at his death, either in two sales which lasted in total nearly a fortnight, or to various beneficiaries under his will. It was one of the great private collections of nineteenth-century Scotland, but while it was similar in nature to Scott's, Sharpe's exceptional connoisseurship ensured that the quality of the individual pieces he had gathered was greatly superior.<br>
<br>Sharpe lived in and for the past. His clothing throughout his life was that of the Oxford undergraduate of the early nineteenth century; his tastes in music, literature, and gossip remained firmly in the mid-eighteenth; and his relationships with others were conducted in a style long outmoded. But his scholarship was real. In the words of his obituarist in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, his knowledge was like his taste, &#145;a thing perfect in itself. Whatever might be its limits it was complete and faultless within them&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 2511, fol. 3).<br>
