<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nicholson,  (Edward) Max</span>  (1904&#150;2003), <span class="occ">ornithologist and environmentalist</span>, was born on 12 July 1904 at Kilternan, co. Dublin, Ireland, the elder son of Edward Prichard Nicholson (1875&#150;1945), photographer, and his wife, Constance Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oldmeadow (1875&#150;1945), daughter of the chief clerk and chief superintendent of the Cheshire constabulary. At an early age he developed a passion for ornithology, a distrust of government, and a view that his generation had a duty to make things better because the slaughter of younger men in the First World War had left an incompetent old guard in charge of public affairs. These were to determine his life.<h2>
<a name="Educationandornithologicalbeginnings"></a>Education and ornithological beginnings</h2>Nicholson was educated as a scholar at Sedbergh School. However, when his father defaulted even on the reduced fees, he left at the age of seventeen. He lived with his family for a year in Germany, benefiting from being able to observe birds in a somewhat different environment and from being able to reflect on British society from an overseas perspective. In 1923 he took a hack job writing travel guides. His first published work had been a note in <span class="italic">The Field</span> at the age of thirteen; his first newspaper article was published in 1921. He continued to write for newspapers, especially on birds, and by 1925 was well established. Submitting material to <span class="italic">The Times</span> drew him to the attention of the editor, Geoffrey Dawson, who advised him to go to Oxford. A scholarship at Hertford College, supplemented by some small grants and his writing income (he was the Oxford correspondent of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>), allowed him to do so in 1926.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Nicholson read modern history but, while this gave him a lifetime interest in current affairs, he spent more time learning ornithology. This he did from Bernard Tucker, a young don and a driving force in the infant Oxford Ornithological Society. Nicholson had published <span class="italic">Birds in England</span> (1926) before going to Oxford and was soon drawn into the society's affairs. Having already discovered the value of systematic observations and of census work in ornithology, he organized teams to undertake such work in Oxford and, in 1927, the first national census of any British bird, the grey heron. (The census was repeated annually thereafter.) With the support of the ecologist Charles Elton, he set up the Oxford University Exploration Club, and took part in expeditions to Greenland and British Guiana.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Birds in England</span>, Nicholson promoted the new ideas about ornithology that were developing and the need to bring them together, asserting that the old-fashioned collecting mania had to be channelled into something more useful. <span class="italic">How Birds Live</span> (1927) presented &#145;the new ornithology&#146; and <span class="italic">The Art of Bird-Watching</span> (1931) was a practical guide to field observation. Their favourable reception, his experiences of Oxford, and the success of the heronries census led him to found the British Trust for Ornithology in 1933, in order to organize collaborative fieldwork by amateurs, serving as the trust's first honorary secretary and later as chairman (1947&#150;9). In 1938 he and others founded the Edward Grey Institute in Oxford for professional studies linked to the British Trust for Ornithology, though the linkage later withered.<h2>
<a name="PEPandwartimeandpostwaradministration"></a>PEP and wartime and post-war administration</h2>After leaving Oxford with a second-class degree in modern history in 1929 Nicholson had become assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Weekend Review</span>. This advocated planning and, when challenged by politicians to say what he would do were he in government, Nicholson produced &#145;A national plan for Britain&#146; as a supplement to the <span class="italic">Weekend Review</span> in February 1931. Within months the think-tank Political and Economic Planning (PEP) had been set up by a group of advanced thinkers and businessmen, including Nicholson, who served as its second secretary from 1933. Meanwhile, on 6 August 1932 he had married (Eleanor) Mary Lloyd Crawford (1908&#150;1995), daughter of George Eustace Bigelow Crawford, barrister, of Shurdington House, Gloucestershire; they had two sons, Piers and Tom.<br>
<br>Though apparently ignored by government, PEP established the thinking that allowed radical measures to be taken when the Second World War came. The Post War Aims Group was set up under its auspices, with Nicholson as an active member, aiming to avoid the mistakes that had been made after the First World War that were considered to have led to the second; its first report appeared the day after the declaration of war. Nicholson was quickly recruited to the Ministry of Information but he resigned after six weeks, dismayed by the incompetence of the civil service. He was, however, in 1942 persuaded to join the Ministry of Shipping, later the Ministry of War Transport, where he became head of the allocation of tonnage division (responsible for planning virtually all British seaborne freight). Here he displayed his talents for radical thought, for getting around procedural obstacles, for getting the right person into the right job, and for getting people to work together. He invented, as instruments of economic warfare, both the ship warrant scheme and the Middle East Supply Centre. He travelled widely, attending the summit meetings at Quebec, Yalta, Malta, Cairo, and Potsdam. Opportunities for bird-watching were not neglected: he once caused alarm on an Atlantic crossing by innocently revealing that he knew the ship's position&#151;from observing the birds.<br>
<br>Nicholson played a major part in post-war reconstruction, as secretary of the office of the lord president of the council, and Herbert Morrison's most senior civil servant. Morrison and his team played a key role in prioritizing the wealth of legislation that was enacted, on town and country planning, agriculture and forestry, national parks, and nature conservation, Nicholson having a deep personal interest in all of these, especially the last. His main role in the office was to promote economic planning, though he later felt that the government had been mistaken to give this high priority in its manifesto, rather than letting it take its course. This work fell foul of political rivalries in the government, the determination of the Treasury to assert its traditional authority (combined with its suspicion of planning), and the reaction of some civil servants, especially in the Treasury, to an assertive man whose mind worked more quickly than theirs. Nevertheless the loss of the economic planning role to the Treasury freed up Nicholson's time to the extent that he was able, for example, to chair the committee that organized the Festival of Britain&#151;its success being in his mind largely the result of government letting others get on with the job. His organizational skills triumphed over the tight time-scale with which he was faced.<h2>
<a name="TheNatureConservancy"></a>The Nature Conservancy</h2>After Morrison moved to the Foreign Office in 1951 Nicholson decided to leave the civil service. The Nature Conservancy, established by royal charter in 1949, was not flourishing and in 1952 Nicholson was persuaded to become its director-general, in succession to Cyril Diver. Nicholson's appointment heralded the glory years of the conservancy. Not only were nature reserves established but so was the conservancy's responsibility for promoting conservation issues more broadly, on a basis of sound science. Nicholson's passionate belief in basing policy on evidence and rational thinking flowered: he promoted fundamental research as well as that directly applied to managing particular sites; he established a network of research stations; he promoted ecological education, in particular an MSc course in ecology and conservation at University College, London; and he gathered a talented team and inspired them. He also encouraged the voluntary bodies, recognizing that the energies of their armies of skilled field naturalists could provide a wealth of scientific evidence far in excess of what the few professionals could achieve. He reached out to the wider public, funding the Council for Nature to run an intelligence unit for three years, until the media became used to the idea of running stories on the environment. He took up a challenge by the duke of Edinburgh to mount the &#145;Countryside in 1970&#146; conferences (1963&#150;70), the first at very short notice. They massively raised the profile of conservation in Britain.<br>
<br>Although reluctant at first to divert British conservation energies into international activities, Nicholson found a Foreign Office lawyer to draw up a constitution for the International Union for the Protection (from 1956 Conservation) of Nature (IUCN) in 1948, and he remained a strong supporter throughout his time at the Nature Conservancy. As ever he promoted the importance of ecological science to the organization's activities and, as convener of the section on terrestrial conservation in the international biological programme, he sought to create a scientific database for the world's key conservation areas. Victor Stolan pointed out that if the IUCN was to be effective, it needed millions of pounds. In 1960&#150;61 Nicholson discussed with Peter Scott, Guy Mountfort, and others the possibility of setting up a voluntary body to raise such funds, wrote a constitution for it, and got the duke of Edinburgh involved as British patron. So in September 1961 the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was born. As was his habit, having set it up and got a good team to organize the new body, Nicholson largely dropped out.<br>
<br>Nicholson was no mere administrator. Not only did he continue to write and speak on conservation issues but he participated in fieldwork, despite the limp that was a consequence of polio contracted on a survey of Baluchistan for the United Nations Development Programme in 1952. This included participation in Guy Mountfort's expeditions to the Coto Do&ntilde;ana in 1957 and to Jordan in 1964, reports arising from which were influential in promoting nature conservation in both areas.<br>
<br>Politically skilful, as head of the Nature Conservancy Nicholson fought off pressures from the Treasury, landowners, and some politicians that might otherwise have crushed the infant body. But in 1965 it was absorbed into the new Natural Environment Research Council; in 1973 it became the Nature Conservancy Council, a grant-aided body of the new Department of the Environment, but its research functions remained with the research council. By then Nicholson had left the Nature Conservancy, having retired in 1966. Another turning point was his marriage in 1965 to Marie Antoinette (Toni) Mauerhofer (1928&#150;2002), his first marriage having been dissolved the previous year. With his second wife he had another son, David.<h2>
<a name="Establishmentcriticandenvironmentalcampaigner"></a>Establishment critic and environmental campaigner</h2>Nicholson's retirement from the Nature Conservancy allowed him to pursue new projects. The chief of these was a trilogy of books. <span class="italic">The System</span> (1967) was, as its subtitle said, about &#145;The misgovernment of modern Britain&#146;. It criticized the civil service, especially the Treasury, for conservatism, inflexibility, and slowness to respond to need for change or action (or even to recognize it); for its public school ethos; for its denigration of professionalism and rational thinkers, and its technical incompetence; for its failure to adopt rational and experimental approaches or to learn lessons; and for its abandonment of planning. The book saw similar problems in the country at large. It made a case for abolishing the Treasury. Though it received much publicity and led to increased public awareness of deficiencies in the civil service, officials readily persuaded ministers not to attempt fundamental reform. <span class="italic">The Environmental Revolution</span> (1970) was written to inform the growing band of concerned people about the need to address the impact of man on the environment. His view that conservation was essential, not a luxury, was widely accepted. Here again Nicholson felt that the established rulers were not intellectually equipped for the task in hand, but he also felt that there was a revolution in progress, with the technically competent taking over. Strangely, <span class="italic">The Big Change</span> (1973), which argued for a big change in our management of the environment, was a &#145;flop&#146; (his word), and was published only in the USA.<br>
<br>Nicholson was always one to translate vision into action. Another retirement project was therefore to set up, in 1966, Land Use Consultants, to advise industry on how to reduce the environmental damage that might otherwise result from its activities, a new idea at the time. He remained as chairman until 1989. He also helped found the <span class="italic">Ends Report</span>, a journal for environmental managers in industry, and served as managing editor. Among other organizations he was involved in initiating were Earthwatch Europe and the International Institute for Environment and Development. Having been shown the Mallorcan wetlands site of s'Albufera while on a family holiday, he was a key driving force in its study and conservation as a national park. In 1977 he took responsibility for the environment on the committee organizing the queen's silver jubilee celebrations. Having experienced guided walks on nature reserves, he produced the idea of the silver jubilee walkway, to show people London's historic sites and to be a permanent marker of the celebration.<br>
<br>Ornithology remained Nicholson's greatest passion. He had taken over the reins of the important journal of record, <span class="italic">British Birds</span>, on the death of its editor, Bernard Tucker, in 1951. He put together an editorial team of which he remained chairman until 1960, and a member until 1971. In the mid-1960s he led the initiative to produce <span class="italic">The Birds of the Western Palearctic</span>, the first volume of which appeared in 1977 and the ninth, and last, in 1994. Having written the habitats accounts for all but a few vagrant species, Nicholson was the only member of the editorial team to have seen the project through from start to finish.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>In 1996, with a small number of colleagues with experience in the environment and development movements, Nicholson founded the New Renaissance Group, of which he was the first chairman. Its aim was to be a stimulant to move humanity from its patently disastrous course in relation to the environment. As for many years, but still perhaps ahead of his time, Nicholson promoted the view that conservation and development had to go hand in hand, and that environmental, economic, and social considerations had to be pulled together. The New Renaissance Group produced a collection of essays under the title <span class="italic">Where Next?</span> (2000), and organized a workshop that took forward the thinking of those essays to produce the statement &#145;Beyond sustainable development&#146; (2001), in the drafting of which, at the age of ninety-six, Nicholson played a lively part. The secretary of the New Renaissance Group was Teresa Sexton, who had become Nicholson's secretary in 1945 and who worked with him until the end of his life. His success in organizing so many activities in his varied life was underpinned by his ability to inspire such commitment and loyalty in his colleagues.<br>
<br>Described by Israel Sieff as &#145;the cleverest man I have ever met&#146;  (Sieff, 191) and by Bernard Donoughue and G. W. Jones as &#145;A man of mercurial intelligence, firing off ideas like a catherine-wheel&#146;  (Donoughue and Jones, 350), Nicholson was widely honoured. His work with Morrison resulted in his appointment as CB in 1948 and that with the WWF in appointment as CVO (1971) and Commander of the Order of the Golden Ark, of the Netherlands (1973). He was, however, dismissive of those honours that were bureaucratically routine, and twice turned down offers of a knighthood. He died at his home, 13 Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, on 26 April 2003, of old age. He was survived by his three sons, both wives having predeceased him.<br>
