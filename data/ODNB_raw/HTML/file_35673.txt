</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ransome,  Arthur Michell</span>  (1884&#150;1967), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born at 6 Ash Grove, Headingley, Leeds, on 18 January 1884, the eldest in the family of two sons and two daughters of Cyril Ransome, professor of history at the Yorkshire College (later Leeds University), who died in 1897, when Arthur was thirteen, and his wife, Edith (<i>d</i>. 1945), daughter of Edward Baker Boulton, who had been a sheep farmer in Australia. He was educated at the Old College, Windermere, and then at Rugby School (1897&#150;1901), but he was a reluctant pupil. Doggedly determined from early adolescence that he was going to be a writer, he spent two unprofitable terms at the Yorkshire College reading science before he threw in his hand and left for London, where he found a job for 8<i>s</i>. a week at Grant Richards, the publishers. He was then seventeen.<br>
<br>Ransome's bohemian life in London, with a brief period in Paris, lasted for some twelve years. He scratched a living by writing stories and articles, some of which appeared in book form; he reviewed and ghosted. His literary friends included Edward Thomas (who once described him as &#145;exuberant, rash, and Protean&#146;), Lascelles Abercrombie, Gordon Bottomley, Robert Lynd and his wife, Sylvia, and Cecil Chesterton, brother of G. K. Chesterton. There were also actors and artists with whom he would celebrate the sale of an article or a picture by a flagon of Australian burgundy and a meal of macaroni cheese. Many of these met at the studio &#145;evenings&#146; of Pamela Colman Smith (Pixie); he later said that it was from her telling of Jamaican folk-stories that he learned so much of the art of narration. He was very poor but nevertheless avidly bought books, and he later attributed his chronic digestive troubles to the meagre and erratic meals of that period.<br>
<br>If there was time for a brief holiday and he could scrape together the fare, Ransome found himself hurrying &#145;through the big grey archway at Euston that was the gate to the enchanted North&#146; on his way to the Lake District, where, before his father had died, his family had spent blissful summer holidays. There he passed much of his time with the family of W. G. Collingwood, adopted as an honorary nephew by the parents, camping and boating with the children, one of whom was Robin Collingwood. In 1928 he taught the next generation, Taqui, Susie, Mavis 
    (1920&#150;1998, known as Titty)
  , and Roger Altounyan, children of the eldest daughter, Dora, to sail their dinghy <i>Swallow</i>. From the idyllic summer that he spent with them on Coniston Water the story of <span class="italic">Swallows and Amazons</span> evolved, although he later chose to disclaim this. Childlike himself, he did not much care for children unless they could share the activities he enjoyed, but those that did often found themselves featuring in one of his stories of holiday adventure. He hoped to marry Barbara, the second Collingwood daughter, but this never came about, and it was to escape the unhappy marriage that he did make, to Ivy Constance (1882&#150;1939), daughter of George Graves Walker, on 13 March 1909, that he went to Russia in 1913.<br>
<br>The winter of 1912&#150;13 had been one of continual nightmare. A book commissioned by Martin Secker on Oscar Wilde had landed Ransome in a suit for libel issued by Lord Alfred Douglas; although judgment was given against Douglas in April 1913, it was a scarring experience. Meanwhile, seeing Russian folk-stories as the material for a new book, he decided to visit Russia itself. Arriving there in June 1913, he taught himself Russian, collected folklore, and busied himself with writing a guide to St Petersburg commissioned by an English firm. He completed <span class="italic">Old Peter's Russian Tales</span> in 1915, during a bad bout of illness. These skilful retellings of traditional stories were published the following year, by which time he had taken on the post of Petrograd correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. Paying regular brief visits to England, he was to stay in Russia until 1919, becoming friendly with Lenin (whom he habitually sentimentalized in his writing) and other Bolshevik leaders, especially Karl Radek, and making himself unpopular with the British Foreign Office by his pro-Bolshevik stance and opposition to foreign intervention in Russian affairs. Robert Bruce Lockhart, who headed a British mission in Moscow in 1918, described him as &#145;a sentimentalist, who could always be relied upon to champion the under-dog, and a visionary, whose imagination had been fired by the revolution&#146;. In <span class="italic">Six Weeks in Russia in 1919</span> (1919) he gave a picture of Moscow in those days of starvation and high hopes, and in <span class="italic">The Crisis in Russia</span> (1921) he defended the Russian Revolution and pleaded for a more balanced view of its aims. Yet documents discovered in 2002 showed that Ransome was in fact a British secret agent working for MI6 and that he filed regular reports back to his superiors at the secret intelligence service (SIS), who were working to crush the revolution in Russia. It is likely that Ransome was recruited by Clifford Sharp, editor of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, who ran the British propaganda bureau in Stockholm during the war, with the aim of infiltrating Russian revolutionary organizations.<br>
<br>By that time Ransome was living in Estonia with Yevgeniya Petrovna Shelepina (1894&#150;1975), daughter of Pyotr Shelepin. When he had first met her in 1917 she had been Trotsky's secretary. He was to marry her on 8 May 1924, after the dissolution of his first marriage. His connection with the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> ended in 1919 after a change in editorship brought a change in its political viewpoint. But C. P. Scott recruited him for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, for which he was to continue to write until 1930. From Estonia he reported on the scene in Russia, and such time as he could spare from newspaper articles he spent in the fishing and sailing that all his life were an absorbing passion. In the <i>Racundra</i>, a 30 ton ketch, built to his specifications at Riga, he cruised round the Baltic in 1922, accompanied by his superior from SIS, Ernest Boyce. The log of this holiday was published in <span class="italic">&#145;Racundra's&#146; First Cruise</span> (1923), the first book that is characteristic of the sort of writing for which he is now remembered.<br>
<br>At the end of 1924 Scott sent Ransome as correspondent to Egypt and then in 1925&#150;6 to China, but Ransome was growing increasingly weary of political journalism and longing to settle to his own writing, in particular &#145;a brat book&#146; as he himself termed it. (By this time he had bought a cottage, Low Ludderburn, on the fells above Windermere.) In March 1929 he began to write <span class="italic">Swallows and Amazons</span>. Published in 1930, it was slow to sell. Jonathan Cape, the publisher, had received it politely but was more interested in his fishing essays, <span class="italic">Rod and Line</span> (1929), originally published in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Nevertheless he persisted, following it up with a further account of the Walker children and their allies the Blacketts sailing Lake Windermere and exploring the fells&#151;<span class="italic">Swallowdale</span> (1931). But only with his third story, <span class="italic">Peter Duck</span> (1932), did he soar into the popularity that made his nine other books for children best-sellers. (It was in <span class="italic">Peter Duck</span> that he first attempted his own illustrations, a practice he was to continue.) <span class="italic">Winter Holiday</span> (1933) recalled a winter he had spent in the Lakes when he was at preparatory school. There were books such as <span class="italic">Coot Club</span> (1934) about bird-watching and sailing on the Norfolk broads, near which he lived for a time from 1935 on the River Orwell, in Suffolk. For <span class="italic">Pigeon Post</span> (1936) he received the Library Association's first Carnegie medal for the best children's book of the year. He became an honorary DLitt of Leeds University in 1952 and was appointed CBE in 1953. He published his last book, <span class="italic">Mainly about Fishing</span>, in 1959.<br>
<br>Bald, vastly moustached as he became in later life, habitually dressed in a fisherman's sagging tweeds and a thimble of a tweed hat, Ransome still contrived to retain much of the appearance of the round, rosy, bright-eyed schoolboy that can be seen in early photographs. With it went a boyish charm of manner with its mingling of enthusiasm and fierce indignation; a deftness of fingers&#151;especially where tying flies was concerned&#151;and a stimulating ability to say something new and unexpected about almost any subject.<br>
<br>Ransome died on 3 June 1967 at the Royal Hospital, Cheadle, Manchester, and was buried in Rusland church, Lancashire. His first wife had died in 1939, and his second wife died in 1975. He had one daughter from his first marriage, Tabitha (<i>b</i>. 1910).<br>
