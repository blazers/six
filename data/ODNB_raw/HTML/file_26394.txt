<span class="headword">Stephens,  Thomas</span>  (1821&#150;1875), <span class="occ">historian</span>, born at Pontneddfechan, Glamorgan, on 21 April 1821, was the son of Evan Stephens, a shoemaker, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of William Williams, minister of the Unitarian church at Blaen-gwrach. Stephens was educated at a private school at Neath. Early in 1835 he was apprenticed to a chemist at Merthyr Tudful, where subsequently, on his own account, he successfully carried on the business until his death. On 11 September 1866 he married his cousin, Margaret Elizabeth Davies, a granddaughter of William Williams of Penrheolgerrig. They had no children, and she outlived him.<br>
<br>From his earliest days Stephens devoted himself to the study of Welsh history, literature, and institutions. His interest was first stimulated by eisteddfod competitions, in which, from 1840 and almost annually until 1859, and thereafter in 1862, 1866, and 1872, he was awarded prizes for essays on historical, literary, and social subjects. In 1848 he produced &#145;An essay on the literature of Wales during the twelfth and succeeding centuries&#146;, which won him the prize offered in the name of the prince of Wales at the Abergavenny eisteddfod, thereby defeating Thomas Price (1787&#150;1848), a Welsh historian of repute in his day. The essay was published at the expense of Sir John Guest as <span class="italic">The Literature of the Kymry</span> (1849), and was enthusiastically received by the best Celtic scholars, including Hersart de la Villemarqu&eacute;, Henri Martin, and Professor Albert Schulz, many of whom afterwards corresponded regularly with Stephens. In later years Matthew Arnold praised this work in <span class="italic">The Study of Celtic Literature</span> (1867). Schulz, under his pseudonym of San Marte, brought out a German translation of the work, published in Halle in 1864. A second edition, with the author's additions and corrections, was posthumously published, under the editorship of the Revd D. Silvan Evans, in 1876, with a biography by B. T. Williams.<br>
<br>After 1848 Stephens won prizes for historical essays at every eisteddfod at which he chose to compete, being, for example, awarded three prizes at the Abergavenny eisteddfod in 1853. For the eisteddfod held at Llangollen in 1858 he wrote an essay in which he proved the unhistorical character of the Welsh claim to the discovery of America by Madog ab Owain Gwynedd; but the eisteddfod committee, influenced by John Williams ab Ithel, one of the eisteddfod organizers, whose own essay was awarded second place in the competition, withheld the prize from Stephens on the quibbling pretext that he had written on the non-discovery instead of the discovery by Madog. This essay was published in 1893 under the title <span class="italic">Madoc: an Essay on the Discovery of America by Madoc ap Owen Gwynedd in the Twelfth Century</span>, edited by Stephens's friend and scholarly colleague Llywarch Reynolds. Stephens did not again compete at the eisteddfod, though, at the request of that institution, he subsequently drew up a report, along with R. J. Pryse (Gweirydd ab Rhys), on a standard of Welsh orthography, <span class="italic">Orgraff yr iaith Gymraeg</span> (1859). He contributed a series of valuable articles in Welsh on the triads (ancient Welsh classifications of names and legendary references, tripartite in form) to the periodical <span class="italic">Y Beirniad</span> (1861&#150;3), in which he established their medieval as opposed to their prehistoric origin; and in the course of seven articles in English in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> (1851&#150;3) he critically examined the poems traditionally ascribed to Taliesin. Other important articles in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> (1858, 1872) revealed the spurious character of Coelbren y Beirdd, the so-called bardic alphabet, and of the <span class="roman">Book of Aberpergwm</span>. He left a large number of unpublished essays, one of which, probably the most important, was edited by Professor Thomas Powel of University College, Cardiff, for the Cymmrodorion Society, and published in 1888 under the title <span class="italic">The Gododin of Aneurin Gwawdrydd: an English Translation &hellip; [with] a Life of Aneurin</span>.<br>
<br>Stephens was one of the first native Welsh scholars of the nineteenth century (and before the establishment of the University of Wales) to apply a rigidly critical method to the study of Welsh history and literature. His approach was sceptical and iconoclastic, and it made him highly unpopular with Welsh enthusiasts and romantics who accepted Iolo Morganwg's fantastic accounts of Welsh literary history. But his unbiased, questioning attitude gained him the confidence of competent critics. His opinions in other respects were also often unpopular, both nationally and on local issues. He evoked the hostility of dissenters by advocating, from 1847 onwards, a state-aided system of secular education. His attitude towards the Welsh language was ambiguous. In 1840 he had cast doubt on the importance of preserving the language, but nevertheless he became, in 1847, a passionate opponent of the opinions voiced in the report on the state of education in Wales, the &#145;blue books&#146;. In politics he was a philosophical reformer rather than a radical. Among the institutions at Merthyr which largely owed their origin to him was the public library, of which he acted for twenty-five years as honorary secretary, and to which he bequeathed a valuable collection of books. He was high constable of the town for 1858, and in 1864 undertook the management of the <span class="italic">Merthyr Express</span>.<br>
<br>In 1870 overwork brought on paralysis, which, after repeated attacks, ended in his death on 4 January 1875 at 113 High Street, Merthyr Tudful. He was buried at the nearby Cefn cemetery.<br>
