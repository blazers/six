<span class="headword">Violante <span class="st"> [Larini]</span>, Signor</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1727&#150;1728), <span class="occ">ropeslider</span>, was probably from northern Italy. He was the husband of the famous rope-dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64361/', "Signora (or Madame) Violante (1682&#150;1741)")</script>. The Violantes (who also used the name Larini) had a daughter, Rosina, who married George Richard Estcourt Lupino (1710&#150;1787), dancer, and was the ancestress of the Lupino theatrical dynasty, including Ida Lupino and Lupino Lane.<br>
<br>Violante's first recorded appearance was at 8 o'clock on the evening of 31 May 1727, when he descended head first from the steeple of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. The event may have been scheduled to celebrate the birthday of George I. Violante travelled over the rooftops of St Martin's Lane to the west side of the royal mews&#151;a distance of 300 yards in 30 seconds&#151;leaping off the rope only yards from the feather bed laid to receive him. The large audience included the royal princesses; pickpockets &#145;made good Earnings of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 1 June 1727). He was foiled in repeating the feat by the vicar, Zachary Pearce, perhaps because of the death of George I on 11 June, and thwarted in his plan to fly from St Paul's Cathedral over the Thames into Southwark, thereby disappointing &#145;a World of good Company&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 1 July 1727). Violante was then promoted by a Welshman, Mr Powell, as the star attraction at the pleasure gardens at Belsize House in Hampstead, north of London. There from 12 June to 24 July he performed three times and later twice a week &#145;several surprising things&#146; on the rope, including &#145;the greatest Performance that ever was done in the World; he caused a live Ass to fly upon the same Rope as he did, and challenges all Men in England or out of England to do the like&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 28 June 1727). The public's enthusiasm for Violante was turned to devilish satire on the English love of novelty in two pamphlets attributed to John Arbuthnot: <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay at St. James's</span> (1 July 1727), and its sequel <span class="italic">A Little More of That Same &hellip; Particularly &hellip; a Most Surprising Account of the Miracles Perform'd by the Flying Ass at Belsize</span>, abounding in allusion to <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span>&#151;&#145;Dr. Swift avers it to be a young Houyhnhnm&#146;  (p. 11)&#151;which elaborated an earlier full-page letter to the <span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span> (24 June 1727) possibly by the same author.<br>
<br>After 24 July 1727 Violante no longer appeared in advertisements for Belsize House. The next year, on 6 July and again a week later, Violante flew from St Vincent's Rocks at Clifton across the River Severn, a distance of 550 yards in half a minute, firing a pistol in each hand, and was &#145;to do something more curious&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, 6&#150;9 July 1728). No further report of Violante appears to have survived, but he had launched a flying craze that crested with the &#145;flights&#146; of Robert Cadman. Numerous unknown&#151;and less talented&#151;itinerant &#145;High-flyers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The touch-stone</span>, 109) were recorded during the 1730s. One flyer, presumably not Violante and possibly a Frenchman called Gillinoe, featured a &#145;flying&#146; jackass at Newcastle in 1733, but weights strapped to the animal's legs fell off, killing a small girl and injuring many, and at Derby in 1734 a similar accident occurred.<br>
<br>Horace Walpole reminisced that &#145;very early in my life I remember this town at gaze on a man who <i>flew down</i> a rope from the top of St Martin's steeple &hellip; [this] Icarus broke his neck at a subsequent flight&#146;  (Walpole, 9.450&#150;51), possibly confusing Violante with Cadman, who died a similar death at Shrewsbury in 1740. Both Violante and Cadman have been identified as funambulists depicted in Hogarth's <span class="italic">Southwark Fair</span> (1733). According to the <span class="italic">Bristol Mercury</span> (27 May 1826), at some unspecified time Signor Violante accidentally hanged himself while performing, perhaps suggesting that he died at or near Bristol: &#145;This Violante was no doubt a wonderfully clever fellow; but in risking his life a hundred times in <i>descending</i> by rope, he ultimately lost it, by being accidentally compelled to perform the experiment in a contrary direction!&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>).<br>
