</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Osborne,  Thomas</span>, first duke of Leeds  (1632&#150;1712), <span class="occ">politician</span>, best known under his earlier titles of earl of Danby and marquess of Carmarthen, was born on 20 February 1632, and baptized eight days later, the second son of Sir Edward Osborne (1596&#150;1647) of Kiveton, Yorkshire, and his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1666), widow of William Middleton of Stockeld, Yorkshire. He became his father's heir in 1638 when a chimney in the family house at York collapsed, killing his elder brother, Edward. Thomas avoided a similar fate only because he had stopped to play with the family cat which had crawled under a table, an early instance perhaps of his strong survival instinct as well as his persistent dancing with danger. He was well connected on both sides of his family. His father, the grandson of a lord mayor of London, Sir Edward Osborne, had been created a baronet in 1620 and risen under the patronage of Strafford to become vice-president of the council of the north in 1632, a post in which he displayed unswerving loyalty to the king. In 1639 and 1640 Sir Edward superintended the dispatch of troops to the border to take part in the threatened war with the Scots, resigning as MP for Berwick in 1640 because of his military responsibilities, and subsequently became lieutenant-general of the royalist forces raised at York. Sir Edward's first wife was Margaret Belasyse, daughter of Thomas Belasyse, Viscount Fauconberg. Thomas's mother was Sir Edward's second wife, the second daughter of Thomas Walmesley of Dunkenhalgh, Lancashire, and Elizabeth Danvers, who was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7133/', "Henry Danvers, earl of Danby")</script>, and descended from John Neville, fourth Baron Latimer. These connections gave Thomas impeccable royalist credentials and a network of influential relatives, both of which he was to exploit to the full during his later career.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>After defeat at Marston Moor in 1644 Sir Edward Osborne played no further part in the war, but the sequestration of his estate left a legacy of impoverishment that Thomas was later very keen to reverse. The war had also disrupted Thomas's education, for although he appears to have received some tuition in York he did not attend university or an inn of court. Two years after his father's death he left England to tour Europe, accompanied for some time by Sir William Temple, on whose knowledge of international affairs he was later to rely. Having visited Italy Osborne spent 1650 in Paris, where he and other exiles met at the house of Sir Richard Browne, with whose son-in-law, John Evelyn, he became &#145;intimately acquainted&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.14). The diarist's assessment that his one-time friend was &#145;haughty&#146; captures something of Osborne's personality, for his pride was commented on by others  (ibid., 4.20). In 1652 he was back in London, courting a distant cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27109/', "Dorothy Osborne")</script>, but the match was vetoed by his mother. The following year, however, he married a much better connected bride, Lady Bridget Bertie (<i>bap</i>. 1629, <i>d</i>. 1704), daughter of Montague Bertie, second earl of Lindsey. Dorothy Osborne dismissed the match as a piece of fortune-hunting but it seems to have been a loving marriage, which produced three sons, including Edward (<i>d</i>. 1689), the eldest son, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20879/', "Peregrine Osborne")</script>, the third son, the only one who survived his father, and eight daughters. Lady Bridget was depicted by her enemies as a domineering woman responsible for some of her husband's greed if not his success. Thomas and his wife returned to Kiveton, only 6 miles from Welbeck, the seat of the Cavendishes, with whom he became friends. But it was probably not until the Restoration that Osborne secured a connection with George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, who was to be his political patron. In 1661, presumably due to Buckingham's influence, he served as high sheriff of Yorkshire, and his decision to carve out a local career may have resulted from a rebuff to an attempt that year to recover a &pound;1000 fine imposed on the family in the 1640s. Although he was offered &#145;some good peniworths&#146;  (Browning, 2.9) if he would follow Lord Ossory to Ireland he declined to do so. The local knowledge gained by remaining in Yorkshire was to stand him in excellent stead during his ministerial career. In 1662 he was part of a local commission for enforcing the <span class="roman">Corporation Act</span> against dissenters and the following year acquired considerable local standing as a result of his efforts to investigate and uncover a conspiracy, the so-called Yorkshire plot. Complaining to the government when he found others had been insufficiently zealous, he may have discerned the political mileage to be gained out of exploiting fears of rebellion. On 16 January 1665 he was elected as MP for York on Buckingham's interest, against a court candidate.<br>
<br>Osborne followed his patron's hostility to Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon. Both he and Buckingham had been thwarted when Clarendon blocked a bill to restore the council of the north and Clarendon had also ruined Osborne's plan to farm the excise in Yorkshire, a project which he had presented to the king in 1665 and which marked his first foray into fiscal policy. It was therefore probably for factional reasons, rather than ideological ones, that in 1665 he opposed a proposal to extend to the whole nation an oath renouncing taking up arms against the king and promising not to alter the government in church and state. Certainly when there were renewed reports of a conspiracy in the north Osborne refused a commission to investigate, dismissing the danger to the government. His hostility to Clarendon proved the &#145;first step to &hellip; his future rise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 71) because Osborne used it to show his loyalty to Buckingham. This was confirmed when he resigned his deputy lieutenancy to share his patron's temporary disgrace after the mud-flinging which formed Clarendon's counter-attack and again when he opposed the king's attempt to set up his own commission to examine the public accounts, even though Charles attempted to include Osborne on it. Even a long personal conversation with the king on 8 June failed to persuade him. Buckingham's return to favour would therefore mean Osborne's rise.<br>
<br>According to Clarendon's own account Osborne told many before parliament sat that if the lord chancellor &#145;were not hanged he would be hanged himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 3.309) and he certainly began one of the lines of attack; but although he was appointed to the committee that drew up the formal charge against Clarendon and acted as teller of the house on important votes against him, Osborne's part was less prominent than others. Always a solid rather than inspiring speaker he seldom contributed to debates and was distracted by illness and the death of his eldest daughter, Elizabeth. In 1668 he reminded Buckingham of his usefulness by co-ordinating an attack on the duke of Ormond and by harrying Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey. Anglesey was suspended from the treasurership of the navy, and Osborne was rewarded on 5 November 1668 when, on Buckingham's recommendation, he and Sir Thomas Littleton kissed the king's hand for the post. He now had a salary of &pound;1250 p.a, invaluable if he was to make any headway into his &pound;10,000 debt, and was one of Buckingham's key allies. Thus when Clarendon's remaining prop, Sir William Coventry, was removed from privy council Buckingham pressed for Osborne to replace him, but his candidature was blocked in turn by Henry Bennet, the earl of Arlington, who now posed the chief threat to Buckingham's power. Osborne concluded that the duke of York and Buckingham ought to work together and wrote his first survey of party organization to show the advantages of such a collaboration. Although there were defects inherent in the scheme, Buckingham's mishandling of it irritated Osborne who told the duke in December 1669 that he intended &#145;to retire only to the businesse of that imployment I am charged with&#146;  (Browning, 2.24). To some extent he did withdraw, for his only recorded intervention in 1670 was in favour of the new <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, which Buckingham opposed. Osborne's name was still mentioned in March 1670 as a possible member of the new governing cabal, but when he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Buckingham out of his Francophile policy relations between them cooled. By November of that year Osborne told the duke that he found himself &#145;much estranged both from your trust and usuall kindnesse&#146; and, assuring Buckingham of his continuing fidelity, resolved &#145;to retire from all publique employment, in which as I have never received any profitt, so have I been as far from any other satisfaction but that of doing your Grace service&#146;  (ibid., 2.25&#150;6). In fact Osborne dedicated himself to understanding the navy, and both his ambition and his competence pushed him in the direction of rejecting both his patron and his co-treasurer. In the summer of 1671 he accused Littleton of &#145;great disservice to his Majestie&#146;  (ibid., 1.86) and on 11 July privy council resolved that in future there should be a single treasurer. Osborne was duly appointed on 20 September, with an increased salary of &pound;2000.<br>
<br>Having rid himself of his rival Osborne set about using his post to replace the patronage offered by Buckingham with that of the crown. Indeed, he was to acquire the reputation of being false to his friends and to the nation; or, in the words of his enemy Shaftesbury, was &#145;cut out naturally for a courtier&#146;  (Christie, 2.312). His diary shows frequent visits with the king or duke of York to the fleet and these trips appear to have dispelled any bad impressions created by his earlier behaviour. On 29 April 1672 he was offered a seat on privy council, even though this was shortly after the stop of the exchequer, the declaration of indulgence, and the declaration of war against the Dutch, all of which he opposed. The tensions between Osborne and Buckingham over the direction of government policy were evident when Osborne sent him Slingsby Bethel's <span class="italic">The Present Interest of England</span>. It is unlikely that Osborne agreed with Bethel's plea for toleration as a way of promoting trade, but the tract did challenge the basis of the war with the Dutch and extol the virtues of the triple alliance of Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands, positions with which Osborne agreed wholeheartedly. Buckingham replied in <span class="italic">A Letter to Sir Thomas Osborn</span>, which set out the government position and poked fun at the number-crunching Osborne by claiming that it was impossible to make all this &#145;as plain as that two and two make four&#146;  (p. 18). A reply, <span class="italic">Observations on the Letter Written to Sir Thomas Osborne</span>, in turn ridiculed the idea that the Dutch were suited to pursuing imperial ambitions and claimed that France had a &#145;universal design&#146;, thus posing by far the greater threat. The exchange is important, since it marks the foundations of the foreign policy which Osborne was to pursue throughout his career.<br>
<br>For most of the summer Osborne duly absconded from London. His attendance at several meetings of government supporters in late 1672 perhaps encouraged a bid to secure his support in the forthcoming session, for Osborne received, two days before parliament met, a warrant for his elevation to the Scottish peerage as Viscount Osborne of Dunblane. Although he was appointed to the committee drafting the address from the Commons against the declaration of indulgence and spoke against the bill to ease protestant dissenters, arguing that a relaxation of the requirement to renounce the solemn league and covenant would incite them to rebellion, Osborne was more an opponent of the religious policy than of the court itself. Thus although he supported the <span class="roman">Test Bill</span>, he sought to moderate some of its harsher clauses against Catholic officers serving in the army and the duke of York's household. On monetary matters, moreover, he argued the government case, urging for as much money for the navy as possible as the best safeguard against popery. This stance prompted a reconciliation between Osborne and the duke of York, an alliance that lasted until 1678 and which was partly behind his promotion on 19 June 1673 to the post of lord treasurer, though Buckingham's support was also instrumental. Lord Clifford had been forced to resign because of his Catholicism, but, according to Sir John Reresby, Osborne was to pay Clifford half of the salary of his office or, some said, a large one-off payment of &pound;10,000&#150;20,000. At his swearing-in Osborne was treated to a speech by the earl of Shaftesbury, who reminded him that the talents which allowed men to rise were often different from those needed to maintain themselves. Osborne thanked the earl at the time but, when the ambiguity sank in, &#145;sent a gentleman to desire him to return him the thanks he had given him&#146;  (Le Neve, 107). In explaining his friend's rise Evelyn acknowledged that he was &#145;a man of excellent natural parts&#146; but thought he had &#145;nothing generous or gratefull&#146; in him  (Evelyn, 4.20).<h2>
<a name="Lordtreasurer16731679"></a>Lord treasurer, 1673&#150;1679</h2>Promotion brought Osborne new status. On 15 August 1673 he was created Baron Osborne of Kiveton and Viscount Latimer of Danby in the English peerage, allowing him to resign his Scottish title to his son Peregrine. But his appointment did not bring immediate political dominance and there were plenty of obstacles in the way of his further success. Some of these, such as his rivalry with the secretary to the Treasury, Sir Robert Howard, and his own serious illness in the summer of 1673, were petty or personal. But the most important difficulty lay in the structural inadequacies of the king's finances: a shortfall in the revenue to the tune of an annual &pound;500,000 deficit, debts increased by war, salaries in arrears, and advances paid by tax farmers that mortgaged future revenue. Latimer had never supported the war against the Dutch but recognized that on financial grounds alone it had to end. He immediately began disbanding troops and transferring others to the pay of England's ally, France, in order to transfer cost. His guiding principles were set down in a memorandum of October in which he noted his policy &#145;in all things to promote the Protestant interest both att home and abroad&#146; and to maintain fiscal competence  (Browning, 2.63). Latimer further promised he would either break the French alliance or his own white staff. In order to achieve these aims Latimer had finally to ditch Buckingham and create his own following in parliament. He began to foster close ties with the groups around Edward Seymour, whose rising fortunes had mirrored his own, and Sir Heneage Finch. Towards the close of the year the new treasurer submitted a stark assessment to the king: the crown's fortunes &#145;cannot bee amended but by force or by compliance&#146;, he argued  (ibid.). Clearly showing the weakness or rather impracticability of the former course, Latimer highlighted the need to secure the latter, which meant accommodation with parliament over religion. The state of the finances thus reinforced, or were used to reinforce, Latimer's personal convictions about state and church.<br>
<br>The final breach with Buckingham came in 1674 when the duke was attacked in parliament by the earl of Arlington. Although Latimer did attempt to rescue Buckingham's mastership of the horse his inability to do so provoked accusations of ingratitude from the duke and encouraged a rumour that Latimer might resign. Certainly Arlington appeared to emerge a strengthened rival, especially as he took most of the credit for negotiating the peace. But in the longer run Arlington's factionalism had reduced his usefulness to the king and the peace gave Latimer the opportunity to introduce a series of financial reforms. As a memorandum of 17 March 1674 put it, everything depended on Latimer's fiscal skills: &#145;the sinewes of the monarchy are to bee recovered in these three yeares or niver&#146;  (Browning, 2.65). Latimer urged retrenchment and asked, impossibly, for the king's &#145;steddy and unalterable resolutions to assist him&#146;  (ibid.). Using the money from salaries and pensions, Latimer paid off the armed forces and renegotiated the tax farms at more favourable rates. A settlement was also reached with the bankers affected by the 1672 stop of the exchequer. These early successes brought reward. On 27 June 1674 he was promoted to an earldom, using the title of his granduncle Danby. In the same year he was made lord lieutenant of the West Riding and a Scottish privy councillor. More importantly in September 1674 Arlington resigned as secretary of state. At last Danby seemed free of rivals.<br>
<br>Between 1675 and 1678 Danby attempted to consolidate his power in a number of interlinking ways which were summarized in the maxim &#145;to settle the church and state; to defend the one against schismaticks and papists, and the other against commonwealthsmen and rebels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Supplementary Lindsey MSS</span>, 377). First, he sought to rely on the Church of England for political as well as religious support. Second, he used propaganda to attract support for the court by appealing to the cavalier mentality, vilifying his enemies as republicans and dissenters. Third, he sought by these means to cultivate a party in parliament that was loyal to the court. Fourth, he employed the resources of the Treasury to achieve his aims while retaining sound financial policies. Fifth, for both ideological and financial reasons he sought to divert the king from a Francophile foreign policy. Vigour in the first four objectives, and ambiguity over the fifth, helped polarize English politics into embryonic parties.<br>
<br>Danby's alliance with the Church of England was forged early. From October 1674 onwards Danby began meeting with senior clerics to consider how to suppress popery and support the church, and in January 1675 measures were agreed which included the repression of conventiclers and the formal voiding of the 1672 licences under the declaration of indulgence. A further appeal to Anglican cavalier loyalty was made by a plan to erect a statue of Charles I at Charing Cross and re-inter his body. More significantly, in the 1675 session of parliament Danby introduced in the Lords a <span class="roman">Test Bill</span> which would have confined political power to Anglican royalists by requiring officeholders and MPs to take an oath against resistance to the king and promise never to endeavour to alter the government of church or state. The bill was debated for seventeen days in the upper house, with Lord Chancellor Finch as the principal court speaker, before Danby allowed it to be dropped. Even then he continued to promote a strict alliance with, and political power for, churchmen. In 1676 he directed each bishop to prepare a census of papists and nonconformists in their diocese. Although known as the Compton Census the idea originated with Danby, who believed the results should persuade the king of the viability of suppressing both papists and dissenters without provoking rebellion. Danby also allied with the bishops in the Lords to construct a formidable church&#150;court axis.<br>
<br>Defence of the church and reviving memories of the civil war and its aftermath also figured prominently in a brilliant propaganda campaign. Danby, in alliance with secretary Joseph Williamson and licenser of the press Roger L'Estrange, fully appreciated the power of the press, perhaps because he had witnessed how effective William of Orange's propaganda had been during the Dutch war but also because the treasurer was himself the victim of many libels. Perhaps the most famous of these, the <span class="italic">Letter from a Person of Quality</span>, attacked the court for attempting to construct &#145;a distinct party from the rest of the Nation of the High Episcopal Men and the Old Cavalier&#146;  (p. 1). Danby's administration replied with a barrage of tracts, often publicized in the government sponsored <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, which harped on the themes of the church and civil war. But the most effective reply, sponsored by the treasurer and published on the eve of the 1677 session, was <span class="italic">A Paquet of Advices and Animadversions</span>, which undermined the reputation of the earl of Shaftesbury by warning that he sought to lead the nation back along the steps of 1641.<br>
<br>Although ostensibly appealing to moderation, Danby's propaganda and policies were divisive and provoked opposition. In 1675 an attempt was made, supported by Arlington, to impeach him. Although he knew of the attack in advance and it found weak support, it may have prompted Danby to consider the need for a more disciplined court party. During summer 1675 he increased the number of MPs in receipt of a pension from the excise farm, and shortly before parliament reassembled Danby sent out more than 100 letters inviting MPs to attend. The government worked up lists of supporters which reckoned on about 100 loyal members. The scale of such management was new and resented, so that by creating one party Danby was helping to consolidate another: an anti-court or country party. Despite, or perhaps because of, Danby's methods the court suffered defeats on important supply motions and only very narrowly defeated a motion to address the king to dissolve parliament. These failures of management led Charles and Danby to different conclusions. While the king sought refuge in alliance with France, the minister pressed his master to ally with the Dutch and to renew efforts to construct a court party. Between the prorogation in November 1675 and the new session in February 1677 Danby and his manager Sir Richard Wiseman worked hard to increase the number of court dependants. As Bishop Burnet pointed out, where his predecessors had sought to buy off leading opponents, Danby &#145;reckoned that the major number was the surer game; so he neglected the great men who he thought raised the price too high, and reckoned he could gain ten ordinary men cheaper than one of those&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.71). Alternatively, he first made opponents the lowest offer that there was any chance of them accepting; if they agreed, he won his man, but if not he gave out that &pound;100 more would have bought them and thereby &#145;made them odious &hellip; so that take or leave he gain'd his point&#146;  (Le Neve, 26&#150;7). Danby later admitted to spending &pound;252,467 in the three years 1676&#150;9 as &#145;secret service&#146; money and was alleged to have spent almost another &pound;50,000 more. Danby's attempt to build a court party was thus more organized and on a more ambitious scale than anything undertaken before. Initially his methods seemed very successful. Lists compiled between the spring of 1675 and early 1676 named 137 court voters, and when parliament did reassemble the treasurer was able to head off claims made in the House of Lords that it had been dissolved by the long prorogation. The four ring-leading peers, including Buckingham, were sent to the Tower, and on the back of that success the treasurer secured supply. Paper calculations of support in 1678 even put the number of adherents at over 200. Danby's pensioners were nevertheless far from being a reliable or effective block of votes. Moreover, inside the house his methods inspired the country party to new levels of sophistication, and outside it they created the belief that, as Andrew Marvell put it, he sought &#145;the growth of popery and arbitrary government&#146;  (Marvell, <span class="italic">An Account of the Growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government</span>, 1677).<br>
<br>Danby's chief difficulty, however, lay in the king's fondness for alliance with France. In 1677, pursuing a wholly different policy, Danby successfully manipulated parliament into making addresses promising aid if Charles declared war against France. When ambassador Ralph Montagu wrote suggesting that the alarm these caused in Paris could be used to extract money from Louis XIV, Danby suppressed the letter and on 4 April drew up his own statement for the king in which he argued that the success of the session was in part due to MPs' belief in Charles's firmness against France. He went so far as to suggest that failure to continue this policy would not only ruin future sessions but also alienate the nation so far that it would imperil the government. By contrast, he saw in the current situation &#145;the greatest conjunction of honour, wisedome, glory and nationall advantages that ever offered itselfe in any age to any prince or nation&#146;. He added that a stance of war against France would gain arms and money for the crown by the consent of the people, force which &#145;might incourage you to speake boldly&#146; if parliament refused to negotiate a healthy financial settlement  (Browning, 2.66&#150;9). Charles accepted this most important of policy statements; but his insistence on seeing the colour of parliament's money revealed the weaknesses in Danby's parliamentary management, for mistrust of the court put strings on the support for the war. Aware that Charles resented the attitude of MPs, Danby drafted a memorandum in June 1677 in which he desperately pleaded with the king that only &#145;unsteadinesse of resolution in those steps hee has begun&#146; could spoil his domestic affairs. Danby put the situation as bluntly as he felt able:<blockquote>Till hee can fall into the humour of the people [the king] can never bee great nor rich, and while differences continue prerogative must suffer, unlesse he can live without Parliament. That the condition of his revenue will not permitt that. (ibid., 2.69&#150;71)</blockquote>Charles, however, had already decided that his revenue could be improved by underhand deals with France. Danby had little option but to try to wreck the negotiations or, which might have the same effect, maximize the king's demands. Fatefully, he chose the latter, pressing the French for more money in return for a long adjournment of parliament. Aware of the weakness of his position, particularly after the destructive Buckingham was released in July, Danby declared to the duke of York that it was impossible to serve a king who treated his faithful ministers in this way and threatened to retire from public life. Although James appeased him, both men must have known that in order to save his power Danby had conceded one of his major policy objectives. Attempting to salvage something from the situation he continued to haggle with the French for more money and made one last bid to win back the king to his policy by reviving the idea of a marriage between William of Orange and James's daughter Mary. Charles's agreement in October 1677 raised the stakes all round. The match laid the foundations for an important relationship between William and Danby that would have long-lasting consequences, and in the short term Danby gained considerable prestige. But the gambler's throw also provoked French anger against him. A formal offensive league between England and the Netherlands failed to materialize, allowing France to resume its assault on the king's vacillating mind and forcing an adjournment of parliament from 15 to 28 January 1678. This, Danby noted in a letter to Montagu, meant &#145;that nobody will now beleeve other then that the peace is concluded by concert betwixt us and France&#146;  (Browning, 2.332). Such forebodings were abundantly proved right during the subsequent session. When news of Louis XIV's victory at Ghent reached the Commons on 22 February 1678 a motion to draft an address calling for the removal of evil councillors was only narrowly defeated and, despite Danby's pleadings, a motion was passed to address for an immediate war with France. Ironically the treasurer had been forced into opposing a war which he had been trying for years to persuade the king to undertake and in doing so he lost the trust of both Charles and parliament. Moreover, since parliament had granted no supply and had stopped lucrative custom revenues from French goods, the treasurer was in no position to resist a French proposal to give the king money in return for an alliance. On 25 March Danby sent a letter to Montagu, later brandished against him, confirming English demands, though ironically, as he had predicted, the French offers dissolved.<br>
<br>Danby's policies now lay in tatters. When parliament reassembled on 29 April 1678 it attacked him and proved so intractable that Charles had to prorogue it on 13 May without having been granted any money. The treasurer was all too aware that the king, who had been forced to raise troops without supply, was acutely short of money. He had hitherto maintained financial stability by maximizing revenue from the custom and excise farmers; but he had failed to make major innovations elsewhere and an outline of his fiscal policies shows a rather uncreative approach  (Browning, 3.27&#150;31). Thus although Danby refused to sign France's latest treaty on 17 May, he must have been glad of the money it offered. Even then on 18 June, with parliament back in session, he had to declare that the king could not live without an additional supply of &pound;300,000 a year, but the motion for relief was again mishandled by Danby's parliamentary managers and rejected. It was probably an indication of how desperate he had become that the treasurer considered the possibility of using the army that had been raised to maintain royal authority, though it is also clear that he misread the international scene and expected the peace negotiations to fail. Either way, he failed to disband, flying in the face of direct parliamentary provisions to do so and thereby exacerbating fears about his intentions. By the autumn of 1678 Danby had earned the enmity of both France and the English opposition.<h2>
<a name="ImpeachmentandtheTower16781684"></a>Impeachment and the Tower, 1678&#150;1684</h2>The revelation of the Popish Plot, an alleged Catholic conspiracy to murder the king and massacre protestants, therefore offered Danby an opportunity to resurrect his fortunes. Ignoring Charles's desire to avoid bringing the plot before parliament, the treasurer hoped that he could benefit by proving the plot to be true, even though the duke of York's interests lay in proving it to be false. Thus while Danby wanted a parliamentary investigation in order to restore his anti-popish credentials, York wanted a quick examination before privy council. Danby was even prepared to sacrifice the duke for his own advantage, actively considering a bill of limitations &#145;to paire the nailes &hellip; of a popish successor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 157). Such tensions led inevitably to a rupture, which was only temporarily patched up when it became clear to Danby that the plot threatened to backfire on him as well. Such a breach was dangerous, for Danby had few friends, and his enemies now numbered Ralph Montagu, whose ambition to become secretary of state had been frustrated by the treasurer. Supported by France, Montagu intended to reveal what he knew of Danby's role in the secret negotiations with Louis XIV. Danby knew of this plan and attempted to forestall it by seizing Montagu's papers. But at the end of the debate on 19 December 1678 Montagu informed MPs about a casket containing important letters which were then fetched and read. After hearing the letter of 25 March 1678, in which a proposal for money had been made to Louis only five days after the passage of an act authorizing the raising of money for war against France, the house resolved to impeach. On 21 December the committee reported the charges. These were that Danby had &#145;encroached to himself regal power&#146; through his conduct of foreign affairs, that he had endeavoured to introduce arbitrary power by raising an army on pretence of a war, and that he was &#145;popishly affected&#146; and had concealed the plot  (Browning, 2.74&#150;5). For the next six months Danby attempted, without success, to extricate himself from these legal proceedings.<br>
<br>Danby's immediate response was to persuade the king to add an authorization to the drafts of the offending letters, to allow him to hide behind the power of royal command and neutralize the first and perhaps most damaging of the charges. On 23 December he duly made a defence, during which he ridiculed his concealment of the plot, declaring that &#145;this is the first time that any man was accused to be the concealer of that plot whereof he hath been a principal means of procuring the discovery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs Relating to the Impeachment</span>, appendix, 40&#150;48). He even tried to use the occasion to re-state his fundamental hostility to France. He then successfully made his case one of principle between the houses, ensuring that the Lords refused to order him into custody. To break the deadlock the session was prorogued on 30 December. Subsequent discussions between the king and leaders of the opposition offered the prospect that the prosecution might be dropped if Danby resigned, and he may therefore have leant his weight behind the dissolution of 24 January 1679 which was necessary for the deal's success; but in any case the minister had more positive plans. Having already purged his administration of those who had joined his enemies, the treasurer remodelled it further and came to an understanding with York, securing for him a declaration of the illegitimacy of the duke of Monmouth in return for James's temporary exile. He also sought to influence public opinion by publishing <span class="italic">Two Letters from Mr Montagu</span>, which contained his vindicating speech, and <span class="italic">An Explanation of the Lord Treasurer's Letter to Mr Montagu</span>. Nevertheless the general election proved disastrous for Danby's pensioner MPs. On 1 March the king granted him a pardon for all offences committed before 27 February 1679, but he had still not resigned by the time parliament met on 6 March, and a paralysing dispute over the speakership erupted between him and Sir Edward Seymour, another former ally with whom he had fallen out. Seymour claimed that the king did not &#145;valew the Treasurer's power of a fiddlestick&#146;  (Browning, 1.320), but after much wrangling Charles did back Danby, and the house was adjourned in order to choose another candidate. Only then, on 13 March, did Charles ask Danby to resign and he softened the blow with the offer of a pension of &pound;5000 a year for life and a marquessate. The manner in which Danby resigned ruined any chances that the prosecution against him would be dropped. In an attempt to quell the dissatisfaction Charles assured the Lords on 22 March that Danby was innocent of the charges made against him, but, fearful of what might come out in a full-scale trial, urged him into hiding. From his refuge Danby sent the white staff to the king on 25 March, formally ending his period in office.<br>
<br>The impeachment process continued unabated, but first parliament needed to find Danby. On 26 March a bill was introduced in the Lords to ban him from entering the royal presence, from holding any public office or grants, and banishing him unless he surrendered himself by 1 May. Greater pressure was added by the Commons when, on 1 April, a bill of attainder was passed on the grounds that his absence confirmed the treason charges. Danby therefore surrendered himself and was committed to the Tower of London, where he remained until 1684. Having secured their quarry MPs turned their attention to other matters, but on 25 April he pleaded his pardon in an attempt to block further proceedings. This infuriated MPs since it undermined the whole impeachment process and the Commons voted the pardon illegal. This put the two houses in conflict, as Danby may have hoped, and relations were further soured by demands that the bishops should not be allowed to sit during the impeachment because it was a matter of blood. From the Tower Danby poured oil on the flames by warning that the Commons aimed at complete sovereignty and &#145;must either bee shortly dismiss't&#146; or the king would be ruined  (Browning, 2.82&#150;3). Even after Charles prorogued parliament on 27 May, Danby continued to press for a dissolution. With remarkable foresight he also advised the king to issue a declaration and hold the next parliament outside London, policies which he would adopt two years later.<br>
<br>Although Danby could bombard the king with written advice prison limited his influence, so he pressed Charles for his release. The king promised his continuing favour but either feared the reaction or was secretly quite glad to have Danby at arm's length, for the next five years were a continuous round of blocked appeals. For some the length of his imprisonment must have seemed only natural justice for a man who had vindictively locked up Shaftesbury for a year. Thus when Danby canvassed to secure his release in the autumn of 1680 Shaftesbury declared he would &#145;not abate him an ace&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28053, fol. 203). Danby again petitioned the parliament which met at Oxford in March 1681 but its early dissolution deprived him of a hearing. The longevity of his captivity was also due to allegations, which went further than the impeachment charge, that Danby had not only tried to stifle the plot but was also responsible for the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, the justice to whom Titus Oates had revealed the Popish Plot  (<span class="italic">Some Reflections upon the Earl of Danby in Relation to Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey's Murder</span>, 1679). On 16 May 1681 Edward Fitzharris attempted to free himself from a charge of treason by directly implicating Danby in the murder, and on this evidence a Middlesex grand jury (composed of a number of hostile MPs) indicted the earl. Danby petitioned the king to arrange for an immediate trial so that he could clear his name, but the execution of Fitzharris left him without such an opportunity. On 19 May 1681 he moved king's bench to take action against the publishers of Fitzharris's accusations but these proceedings also proved abortive. On 27 May and 29 June 1682 Danby had his plea for habeas corpus heard but refused at king's bench; the lord chief justice's speech made his ears &#145;tingle&#146;  (Le Neve, 98), prompting him to canvass for the case to be referred to the judges rather than parliament, a move disliked by the king. Despite these set-backs and a series of family disasters, including a near-fatal accident for his wife, whom he was nevertheless refused permission to visit, Danby remained resilient. On 17 August 1683 William Longueville found him &#145;pretty well, and ye same good company, and temperate in what he said&#146; about the Rye House plotters who had been executed  (Thompson, 2.35).<br>
<br>Danby spent much of his time in the Tower preparing vindications of his administration. <span class="italic">An Impartial State of the Case of the Earl of Danby</span> (1679) was a spirited defence. But he had also to engage with Sir Robert Howard, who accused him in <span class="italic">An Examination of the Impartial Case</span> (1679) of gross fiscal mismanagement. There was some truth to these allegations, for the gap between income and expenditure was probably greater at the beginning of 1679 than it had been when he took office. On the other hand it was clear that the king's foreign policy had wrecked smooth relations with parliament that might have yielded supply, in return for only about &pound;300,000 of French aid, and that the treasurer had not decreased the revenue. Danby's reply, <span class="italic">The Answer of the Earl of Danby to a Late Pamphlet</span> (1680), sparked a further exchange: Howard attacked in print again in October 1680, in turn provoking <span class="italic">The Earl of Danby's Answer to Sr Robert Howard's Book</span> (1680), in which he floated the proposal that offering incentives to the managers of taxes, as he had done in the case of the excise, would greatly improve the revenue. Vindication of his administration spilt over into a vindication of the king's conduct since Danby had lost office, for in 1681 he also penned a draft declaration for the king to issue after the abrupt dissolution of the third Exclusion Parliament. Although rejected in favour of a shorter version, the text contained the earl's characteristic appeal to memories of the civil war.<h2>
<a name="Releaseandrevolution"></a>Release and revolution</h2>The immediate cause of Danby's release was the king's decision in 1684 not to summon a new parliament as the law required. According to Danby's eldest son, Edward, Viscount Latimer, the king said in February &#145;that if the judges would not baile you (which hee would see and speake with the judges tomorrow) hee would by God free you himself&#146;  (BL. Add. MS 28049, fol. 214). This proved unnecessary, for on 12 February the judges declared that the earl could be bailed. Once free, Danby immediately sought to regain influence, but although f&ecirc;ted by members of a loyalist club the earl received a much more frosty reception from the duke of York. He also found it difficult to persuade the king to show favour, despite a private interview and a pleading memorandum  (Browning, 2.110&#150;12). He therefore withdrew from court and retired to his Yorkshire estate. Illness prevented him from playing any more of an active role but in December he went back to London in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the mastership of the rolls for his son. Rumours that he himself might gain office in a remodelled ministry were crushed by the death of Charles. Yet James's accession did signal a turn in Danby's fortunes. He found &#145;the king and ministers outwardly very civill&#146;  (ibid., 2.128) and on the first day of the new parliament he presented a petition about his impeachment. Three days later the Lords, annulling a decision of 19 March 1679, declared that the impeachment had lapsed. Danby therefore sent James a new memorandum on 6 July reiterating his call for compensation. This time James summoned him, but the discussions about the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, which the king sought to repeal, were evidently unsatisfactory. James called him again in November, perhaps with a view to him replacing the dismissed Halifax, and the king showed him the provocative speech he proposed to make about the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> and army officers. But again the earl's response appears not to have pleased the king. Danby nevertheless avoided open confrontation. He made no recorded speech in the second session, though he did draft a speech proposing to refer the king's dispensing power to the judges. For the next two years he retired into private life.<br>
<br>During this time Danby renewed his links with William of Orange. In 1686 the king refused him permission to travel abroad, and for much of that year the earl was preoccupied with the fall-out from the collapse of the marriage of his son, Peregrine, Viscount Dumblane. But in 1687, when many of his relatives were deprived of their posts as the king purged office-holders, Danby received a visit from William's agent Dykvelt. On 30 May 1687 William was sent a letter in which the earl declared proudly that &#145;no competitor can pretend an equall share&#146; in his service  (Browning, 2.117). When a second agent, Zuylestein, visited in August he brought a letter for Danby from William and carried one back from the earl. Danby became a key figure in William's plans. On 28 January 1688 Danby was so far identified with the opposition that he received an anonymous letter threatening his life unless he made peace with the king, but such intimidation did nothing to deter him. Danby was nevertheless careful to cultivate Princess Mary as well as her husband William, attempting to place his daughter, Lady Plymouth, in Mary's bedchamber. Danby was one of the first to consider the idea of inviting William, and was the most important tory signatory to the letter that was drawn up in the wake of the acquittal of the seven bishops, whose trial he had attended.<br>
<br>Danby played a key role in the conspiracy against James. He advised William to land in the north, hoping thereby to have &#145;a share in the whole management by the interest he believed he had in that country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.303). Certainly towards the end of August he was sending large sums of money to the continent and was soliciting gentry support among the tory Anglicans. He was also formally reconciled with the earl of Devonshire, the manager of his earlier impeachment but a fellow Williamite. Danby set up his headquarters at Ribston Hall in Yorkshire, where on 1 October he and Devonshire arranged the final details of their planned rising. Danby was summoned by the king to London but excused himself and moved to Kiveton, leaving his son Dumblane at York. While waiting for the invasion Danby played an important part in keeping up the spirits of the Williamites. The invasion force landing in the west both surprised Danby's plans and forced him and his allies into action. Danby took up arms on 20 November and wrote to the prince requesting further direction, though he also lamented William's neglect of the north. On 22 November Danby arranged a bloodless coup at York, riding at the head of horsemen shouting for &#145;a free parlament and the protestant religion and noe popery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 529). Even if he was probably not its author, as the British Library catalogue implies, <span class="italic">Some Thoughts of a Private Person</span> was published to justify the actions at York in terms of a right of resistance to defend legal rights and a denial that this infringed scriptural injunctions.<br>
<br>Having been excluded from the principal share in William's glory, Danby had already begun to fear that complete victory by either James or William would be undesirable, but the prince's call for the forces marshalled at Nottingham under the command of the earl of Devonshire to march south and Princess Anne's departure from Nottingham destroyed any hopes the earl may have had of using his position in the north to act as mediator. It may be significant that James seriously considered the possibility of retreating to the north and throwing himself on Danby; but his flight confirmed Danby's intention to reach London as soon as possible. This he was unable to do because a fear of Irish soldiers seized the north and Danby decided to move westward to meet any threat. Danby did not reach the capital until 28 December, in time to hear William accept provisional control of the government. While the revolution consolidated Danby's power in the north he felt aggrieved by the prince's neglect and the favour shown to Halifax. But his followers did well at the elections to the Convention and the struggle transferred to the parliamentary arena. Danby chaired an address of thanks for William's administration but his supporters were quiet, absent, or perhaps confused in the early debates about the throne. On 29 January, after the Commons had decided on a vacancy, and with Danby in the chair, the Lords heard a proposal for a regency as &#145;the best and safest way to preserve the Protestant religion and the laws of this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 1685&#150;1691, 14.110). Yet Danby spoke &#145;strenuously&#146;  (Le Neve, 113) and duly voted against this, thereby securing its defeat, even though Halifax thought he favoured the project; and then voted against giving William and Mary the crown. He appears to have been attempting to set up an interest for Mary as sole monarch, since he urged her to come to England. Under his influence the Lords therefore objected to the word &#145;vacancy&#146; in the Commons resolution because that implied an elective monarchy. When the resulting conference between the houses reopened the debate in the Commons Danby's followers there voted against the vacancy of the throne. But Mary herself warned that &#145;she would take it extreme unkindly if any, under a pretence of their care of her, would set up a divided interest between her and the prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.393) and Danby was among those summoned to hear William declare that he would return to the Netherlands if he did not receive the kingship for life. The earl had no alternative but to submit. He broadcast his change of heart via Lord Dumblane who apologized on 7 February 1689 in the Commons for not voting in favour of the vacancy. Even so, the earl remained acutely sensitive to tory sensibilities and favoured a rewording of the oath of allegiance so that there was no recognition of the new monarchs as &#145;rightful and lawful&#146;, and when Halifax opposed this Danby &#145;schooled him so shamefully that my Lord Hallifax did not open his mouth&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ballard 45/27a).<h2>
<a name="Returntooffice"></a>Return to office</h2>Despite the differences over the crown, William and Mary seemed to owe much to Danby, who therefore hoped for reward. In February 1689 he was nevertheless offered only the presidency of the council, not the treasurership he desired, while his rival Halifax became lord privy seal. Such was his reluctance to accept the presidency that he later told Reresby it had been &#145;forced &hellip; upon him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 557). Moreover Danby felt compelled to write a remonstrance to the new king only five days into his reign to urge rewards for his followers who had been overlooked. His son, Lord Latimer, was refused the post of gentleman of the bedchamber, which he had held under Charles II, and Lady Plymouth equally failed to enter the queen's bedchamber. On 28 February 1689 Reresby was subjected to a dinner-table indictment by Danby of the government, particularly of its religious policy, and for the following month the earl hardly ventured into parliament, returning only to block the intended repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span>. When confronted he told the king he &#145;would serve him in everything but against the Church&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.211). He was appointed on 1 April as governor of Hull, though he told Reresby it was &#145;as a place of retreat, and whereby to make his terms, shoud there be a change of times&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 571). Not surprisingly the king exclaimed that &#145;as for my Lord Danby hee knew not what to make of him&#146;  (Foxcroft, 2.206). It was only with difficulty that, on 6 April 1689, he was created marquess of Carmarthen, taking his title from property in Wales granted in 1674. The truth was that William resented Carmarthen's imperiousness and remembered his na&iuml;vety in the all-important European sphere. He was a useful if limited statesman but he was also a man with a divisive past. According to Halifax, Carmarthen's heart was never really in the compromise ministry that the king appointed and had allegedly advised that William had as well put himself in the hands of the fanatics as continue his trimming policy.<br>
<br>Carmarthen's awkwardness was clear from his absence from council and parliament for much of May, perhaps a silent protest at what he perceived to be the inadequate financial settlement. But he was forced back when Oates, attempting to reverse the judgments made in 1685 against him, attacked him. Carmarthen declared that the sentence ought to be reversed in so far as Oates had formerly been whipped from Newgate to Tyburn and now ought to be whipped back again. Such rash language provoked the king to wonder whether the marquess was mad when he made the speech. Carmarthen, however, went further and had Oates sent to prison, an act which reanimated animus against him, resulting in a pointed resolution that a pardon was not pleadable to bar an impeachment. In June his son Peregrine, now styled the earl of Danby, was investigated over a privateer which he had fitted out, and John Howe moved that an address be presented to the king requesting that all persons who had ever been impeached by the Commons might be dismissed; from the beginning of the session Carmarthen was thought to be vulnerable to another impeachment. The request for the removal of impeached ministers nevertheless struck at Halifax as much as Carmarthen, and when on 2 August the house attacked the former, Carmarthen's son and followers joined the fray. It may have been the case that he was working with the whigs to overthrow his rival; if so, it merely disgusted William who, in his more exasperated moods, wanted to be rid of the earl. But Carmarthen refused to go unless dismissed and this the king was reluctant to do, for Halifax was deeply unpopular and events were pushing the king towards, not against, the churchmen whom the lord president represented.<br>
<br>Carmarthen's credit rose in the remainder of 1689. The constant bickering between Halifax and the whigs in the second session of the Convention reduced the usefulness of both and alienated the king. By December there were even reports that Carmarthen might be reappointed as treasurer and he was generally held responsible for the dissolution of parliament on 12 January 1690. Halifax's resignation less than a month later signalled Carmarthen's victory in the factional struggle. But it was much more than a personal triumph. He brought ideological allies into government, and on the back of successful elections, in which the church became a rallying cry, Carmarthen returned to the business of creating a court party. Counting on a majority in the upper house but only a core of fifty supporters in the lower, he came to an understanding with Speaker Sir John Trevor to manage the court interest. The lord president also set about restoring financial probity, gaining the excise revenue for the life of the king and the customs for four years. Attempts were made by the whigs to wrongfoot him over the recognition of the king and queen as &#145;rightful and lawful&#146;, which they sought to include in an abjuration bill, and a motion was made calling for Carmarthen's removal. But these actions only confirmed the fact that he was now regarded as the king's principal adviser, a position consolidated when Shrewsbury resigned as secretary of state in June. Always pallid, he was nicknamed &#145;the White Marquis&#146;  (Thompson, 2.149) and for the next three years he appeared to head the government.<br>
<br>But if Carmarthen's power had always been slightly illusory in his first ministry, it was even more so in his second. He now had no department to act as a power base, had a number of strong colleagues to counter-balance him, was an object of suspicion for those with long memories, and in his relations with the new king could not domineer. William's absences on campaign, however, provided a pretext for Carmarthen to try to engross power by cutting out Mary and thinking &#145;little by little to do all&#146;  (Dalrymple, vol. 2, appendix, 2.122). In her private memoirs Mary noted that he was &#145;of a temper I can never like&#146;  (Doebner, 29). Although he worked assiduously in the summer of 1690, he was peculiarly ill-suited to his role as power-broker and alienated both political extremes. The high-church leader the earl of Rochester thus thought him &#145;quite struck up with the Dissenters&#146;  (Browning, 1.481), while the whigs were alienated by his refusal to press for the dissolution of the tory-dominated parliament. When parliament resumed in October the lord president was thus again attacked. Carmarthen had nevertheless resorted to old techniques and been forming a body of &#145;managers of the king's directions&#146;, led by Sir John Lowther and Sir Henry Goodricke  (ibid., 3.178&#150;9). As a result of their and the king's pressure the Commons voted the unprecedented sum of &pound;4 million supply. Carmarthen's position was boosted by his revelation of a Jacobite conspiracy, after Lord Preston was captured with incriminating papers. Thus when William left in January 1691 Carmarthen was again left as &#145;chief minister in his absence&#146;  (Luttrell, 2.137). He now received a pension of &pound;3500 a year and rumours abounded that he would be created a duke.<br>
<br>In 1691 Carmarthen was, in the words of his most astute biographer, &#145;all pervasive rather than all-powerful&#146;  (Browning, 1.489). His position in the government meant that he suffered for any errors, and long before the October session both parties had begun to muster an attack on him. When it came it centred on the miscarriage of the naval forces, but this was diverted onto the earl of Nottingham (perhaps not altogether unwittingly by the earl of Danby), and Carmarthen used evidence from the Preston affair, which implicated malcontents of both parties, to &#145;break the teeth&#146; of his opponents  (ibid., 2.192). In a sense Carmarthen's power rested on division. He was disliked by both extremes, but so long as they were not powerful enough to topple him he was able to head a composite ministry. When, therefore, tory malcontents Rochester and Seymour entered the government in 1692 and sided with Nottingham, the lord president's position was threatened. The zealots attempted to wrest leadership from him by urging a more violent party line. Thus when Rochester advised the king to shift from a land to a sea war, Carmarthen dismissed such tactics as &#145;sitting still and letting the French king take what he will&#146;  (Dalrymple, 2.242). Whereas Halifax had been ideologically committed to a balanced ministry, Carmarthen sought only a pragmatic coalition. He therefore saw his problems in terms of the lack of a solid body of supporters to rely on. He marshalled the court block and supported William's opposition to the <span class="roman">Place</span> and <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span>, both of which sought to limit royal power.<br>
<br>Carmarthen's second fall from power was, though not without drama in its final stages, a gradual process. Power shifted during late 1693 and 1694 towards the whigs, and the emerging manager was not Carmarthen but the earl of Sunderland. During the 1693&#150;4 session the lord president was pushed into awkward compromises. He was active in rejecting the <span class="roman">Treason Bill</span>, an issue about which he felt strongly out of personal experience, but while disliking the scheme to create the Bank of England he argued for it in order to preserve supply for the military campaign. Such ambiguity meant that Carmarthen was increasingly irrelevant to both the king and the whigs, as the remodelling of the ministry in March 1694 showed. Although created duke of Leeds on 4 May 1694, he had effectively been sidelined. Aware of his incongruous position at the head of a predominantly whig ministry Leeds retreated into caution. In August, when asked his views about the fleet, he would &#145;give no opinion but managed his arguments so well for and against&#146; that Shrewsbury could not fathom his opinion, but was &#145;sure he has left himself latitude enough to be of either, as the event shall give occasion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private and Original Correspondence of &hellip; Shrewsbury</span>, 66). As he must have suspected, it was only a matter of time before the whigs sought to be rid of him. In November 1694, perhaps in an attempt to stave off dismissal, he supported (against the king's wishes) the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span>, which required general elections to be held at least every three years. According to his own later memoir, William told him that he &#145;should live to repent it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Copies and Extracts of some Letters</span>, xi). He now also advocated acceptance of the <span class="roman">Treason Bill</span>, albeit with a wrecking amendment. But in the spring of 1695 the House of Commons began to investigate corruption in the East India Company. A bill of penalties against one of the chief culprits, Sir Thomas Cooke, roused Leeds into daily attendance, for he had been accused of receiving &pound;10,000 for speaking against the bill to grant the new East India Company a charter. Although Leeds denied this, with &#145;a most solemn protestation of his cleanness and innocence&#146;  (Le Neve, 121), the investigation revealed that Cooke had enlisted the duke's support through the agency of Sir Basil Firebrace and that a sum of 5500 guineas had been paid. Leeds, most unconvincingly, claimed that he told the intermediary to keep the money and was unaware that it had been left in his house. The Commons decided once again to impeach him.<br>
<br>Leeds immediately delivered a three-hour speech in his own defence. Reminding his audience of his ill treatment in 1678 he declared that the new charges were as baseless as the earlier ones and called for a quick trial. Articles were duly presented on 29 April but accused him only of betraying his trust as a privy councillor by receiving bribes. The following day Leeds entered a plea of not guilty, which seemed highly unlikely, but the key witness, Leeds's servant John Robart, had conveniently disappeared and no further action could be taken before the prorogation. In May he was nevertheless told to absent himself from the council, an order that rendered his position as lord president almost purely nominal. Although he continued to haunt the court his position must have appeared increasingly ridiculous. On his return from campaign William renewed his injunction against attending council, but in return the whigs agreed to call off any further investigation and the impeachment fell with the dissolution of parliament.<h2>
<a name="Dismissalandretirement"></a>Dismissal and retirement</h2>His new semi-detached status allowed Leeds to create difficulties for the whigs in the session of 1695&#150;6. When a <span class="roman">Recoinage Bill</span> came from the Commons Leeds proposed an amendment which would have declared coin to be valued by weight and compensation paid for the shortfall. The whig-guided Commons refused this and Leeds withdrew his opposition. But that he had not changed his mind was clear later in the session when he opposed fixing the rate of guineas at 22<i>s</i>., only to acquiesce once again when he suffered defeat. In the wake of the attempt in February 1696 to assassinate the king Leeds received a special summons to attend a cabinet council, but his main concern in parliament appears to have been to find a way to allow tories to escape the trap being set for them by the whig &#145;association&#146;, which bound subscribers to recognize William as &#145;rightful and lawful&#146; king. Having failed to prevent its formulation entirely, Leeds proposed an alternative form of wording that recognized that William &#145;hath a right by law to the Crown and that no other person whatsoever hath any right to the same&#146;  (<span class="italic">House of Lords MSS</span>, new ser., 2.205). Leeds opposed a similar bill coming from the Commons that made the association compulsory for all office-holders. He took a bigger step into opposition when he intervened on behalf of one of the alleged assassination conspirators, Sir John Fenwick, protesting against his attainder and pleading for a milder penalty. Even then William did not dismiss his titular lord president. In the following session (of 1697&#150;8) Danby continued to provoke the whigs by acting as a manager in the dispute between the houses over Charles Duncombe, a financier friend, whose attainder was rejected in the upper house on Leeds's casting vote. Moreover, when a bill to establish a new East India Company came up from the Commons, he denounced it as against the liberty of the subject and an infringement of the right of sovereignty.<br>
<br>As the tide began to turn against the whigs, Leeds pursued a vendetta against one of their leaders, the chancellor of the exchequer Charles Montagu, in the 1698&#150;9 session. In part this was the result of pique when Montagu, not Leeds, secured the post of auditor of the exchequer; but it was also the residue of the duke's hostility to the whig's financial revolution. Leeds also exploited whig divisions over the standing army by opposing the retention of William's Dutch guards. It can scarcely have come as a surprise when, on 18 May 1699, he was finally dismissed as lord president and, subsequently, from his lord lieutenancies and governorship of Hull; the wonder was that he had held on to them for so long. Even then he may have lost his offices because the king believed him to be dying. After his recovery in the autumn of 1699 Leeds played a very irregular role in public life. In 1700 he was active in parliament about the Darien affair and the issue of royal grants, and in 1701 joined the tories in denouncing the partition treaties; but his distaste for impeachment proceedings was sufficiently strong to cause him to desert them when they went further and attacked the whig ministers. He was rewarded for his moderation when his own 1695 impeachment was finally dismissed along with those against the Junto.<br>
<br>Although he had been courted for his support by the king in 1700 and 1701, it was the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 that brought Leeds back into favour at Whitehall. Although he accepted the post of privy councillor, he &#145;declined being put into any other public post&#146;  (Le Neve, 145), perhaps because he was too moderate for the high-churchmen who gained power but also because he was by now seventy. But defence of his family and the church, two of his abiding principles, could bring him out of retirement. In 1703 he sought, and failed, to obtain legal redress against Montagu (now&#151;ironically&#151;Lord Halifax), and supported the occasional conformity bills that were promoted in the first three sessions of Anne's reign, though not the attempt to tack the measure to supply. During one debate he rashly told Halifax that &#145;his family was raised by rebellion, but his own suffered by it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Beaufort MSS</span>, 96), leading to the challenge of a duel between Halifax and Carmarthen (as Leeds's son and heir, Peregrine, now was) that was stopped only when the House of Lords intervened. In 1705 Leeds told the upper house that the greatest danger to the church came from the practice of occasional conformity, and entered his protest against the resolution that it was in a &#145;safe and flourishing condition&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 6.507). Consequently another potential duel between Halifax and Carmarthen had to be stopped by order of the Lords. But such vehemence was only a sign that once again the whigs were regaining influence. During 1705 most of Leeds's relatives lost their posts.<br>
<br>Soon after the loss of his wife on 7 January 1704 Leeds appears to have contemplated settling down to writing his memoirs. Perhaps as an aid he also began to keep a diary. But family affairs, principally worries about his unstable and impecunious son Carmarthen, seem to have distracted him. In any case a further political shift in 1709&#150;10, in the form of the Sacheverell affair, renewed his activity for the defence of the church. Regularly attending the trial, he signed repeated protests against the resolutions adopted by the whig-dominated Lords against the doctor. Allegedly weeping during Sacheverell's eloquent self-defence, Leeds voted for his acquittal. Leeds was himself prompted into speech, using the occasion to vindicate his own actions at the revolution, claiming he:<blockquote>never thought, that things would have gone so far, as to settle the Crown on the Prince of Orange, whom he had often heard say that he had no such thoughts himself. That they ought to distinguish between resistance and revolution; for vacancy or abdication was the thing they went upon, and therefore resistance was to be forgot; for had it not succeeded it had certainly been rebellion, since he knew of no other but hereditary right. (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 6.847)</blockquote>Nevertheless, while the Sacheverell affair encouraged some into dallying with James Francis Edward Stuart, the Pretender, Leeds opened correspondence with Hanover. His attempt to represent the past in the way he wished to be remembered was also evident in the publication of <span class="italic">Copies and Extracts of some Letters Written to and from the Earl of Danby</span> (1710), which contained a vindicatory introduction. Although calculated to &#145;shew how faithfully I acted to the best of my understanding for the interest of my countrey&#146; in the 1670s  (p. xiii), many of the letters were not accurately reprinted, containing many revisions and omissions in order to minimize his connections with the French negotiations. Leeds also republished, in book form, the collected pamphlets against Howard  (<span class="italic">Memoirs Relating to the Impeachment of Thomas Earl of Danby</span>, 1710). These publications prompted a revival of what one defender called printed &#145;calumnies&#146; against him  (<span class="italic">A Vindication of his Grace</span>, 1711), including the accusation that he had only dared publish Ralph Montagu's letters once the latter died.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Leeds himself died from convulsions on 26 July 1712 at Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, the seat of his daughter Lady Leominster, and was buried at Harthill, Yorkshire, with his ancestors. According to one account, he had lived the last twenty-five years &#145;without ever going once to stool, the excrementious parts of his food, after a due digestion in his stomach being discharg'd the same way it was taken in&#146;  (Le Neve, 145&#150;6). His will expressly forbade that his body lie in state. The earl's third, unstable, surviving son, Peregrine, inherited the title but the estate was left to the first duke's grandson, also named Peregrine. Leeds had outlived most of his friends, contemporaries, and many of his close relatives. Few commentators, contemporary and modern, have been able to ignore the duke's flaws. He was proud, ambitious, and grasping from instinct as well as from the pressure of his own and his family's debts. He saw little wrong with bribery, whether it be designed to line his own pockets or those whom he sought to manage, so that he appeared to some as the epitome of a corrupt courtier. His capacity to misrepresent events and motives, including his own, was sometimes breathtaking. He was a stiff, formal politician, bombastic and domineering. Yet in some of these failings were also the keys to his success. His pride and ambition nurtured a remarkably resilient and persevering determination to be at the centre of affairs and to make political comebacks; such qualities also entailed a dedication to business that made him indispensable to more than one monarch. Indeed the longevity of his service to the crown must rank him alongside Walpole, who resembled him in many ways. Leeds's knowledge of the value of money attuned the treasurer in him and made him appreciate the power of a pension or office to buy favour. He was the first to recognize the power of the Treasury as the key to ministerial pre-eminence and hence, not coincidentally, his administration is found being referred to by contemporaries as a &#145;prime ministry&#146;  (Le Neve, 25). His domineering style dictated the need to create bodies of loyal supporters, while he appreciated that dominance in committee was as important as oratory on the floor of the house. Such skills at parliamentary management did much to pave the way for, and even create, party government. His own talent for misrepresentation gave him insights into the value of propaganda and the deception and intrigue demanded by partisan politics, and he skilfully used the language of moderation for party purposes.<br>
<br>Accused of disloyalty to his friends and patrons there were nevertheless a number of ideological tenets, aside from an unshakeable commitment to securing prominence for his family, from which Leeds could not be shifted. The first and most important was loyalty to the Church of England. Throughout his career, and no matter what offence it caused, he resolutely defended the church against the perceived twin dangers of popery and dissent. In this view he represented a very powerful strain of opinion, which he did all he could to encourage and sustain. This passion for the established church was sufficient to overcome his otherwise habitual loyalty to the Stuarts and his belief in non-resistance in 1688. His agonizing after the revolution on both accounts was also entirely typical of the trauma that many moderate tories suffered. It was this, as much as his political skills, that perhaps gave his place in the post-revolutionary government such importance. The church in danger was his rallying cry at all the high points in his career: in the 1670s, in 1688, and in the early 1690s. The second antipathy which he held throughout his career was towards France. He was hostile to the ambitions of Louis XIV throughout the 1670s and hostile to the threat posed by France after the revolution. Louis recognized as much by fostering the impeachment proceedings in 1678&#150;9. It is thus ironic that Danby was perceived to have presided over the growth of popery and Francophile arbitrary government. In part this reflected a characteristic of both his ministries: his power was always rather illusory. Lacking great personal charm and unable to strike warm political relationships with MPs or monarchs, he tended to preside over, rather than direct, affairs. This figureheading pragmatism had its value, especially to Charles II but also to William, yet it left Danby vulnerable to events. Both in the 1670s and the 1690s he seems to have lacked control of the situation; and it is no coincidence that in both decades his undeveloped sense of foreign affairs left him at a disadvantage. Danby lacked foresight. He was a remarkable, manipulative, and clever man; but he was not an imaginative one. It seems totally plausible, as he later claimed, that he had not foreseen William's coup for the crown. Then, as so often, Danby's pride and egotism obscured his perspicuity. Where he did have vision, in trying to persuade Charles to adopt a resolutely protestant, anti-French policy, he failed to discern that the complicity demanded by the king inevitably destroyed his own credibility. In part this lack of imagination was because Danby was a conviction politician whose policies lay rooted in the prejudices and assumptions of a significant section of the nation. In articulating their opinions Danby was a formidable force.<br>
