<span class="headword">Common,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1868), <span class="occ">agricultural engineer</span>, was born in High Buston, Warkworth, Northumberland, on 25 January 1778, the second child in the family of five sons (one died in infancy) and four daughters of Robert Common of High Buston, a millwright and cartwright from a family of skilled mechanics, and his wife (probably Jane Wilson of Alnwick).<br>
<br>Common followed his father's profession and assisted Henry Ogle, a schoolteacher of Newham, in improving a reaping machine design about 1803. His plans, from which two models were made, substituted a clipping or shearing action for Ogle's rotary one. In 1811 a full-size version was demonstrated secretly at night and appeared to &#145;answer well&#146;, and in 1812 a model was sent to the Society of Arts by Hugh, Earl Percy (later third duke of Northumberland). However, the society made no award of its reaping machine premium as the invention was &#145;incomplete&#146; without proper trials. A second full-size machine, with a reel to bring the standing corn to the knives, and rollers to deliver the cut corn to the ground, was demonstrated in 1812 before witnesses. Common decided to discontinue further experiments because of the trouble and cost, and he passed the patterns to Thomas Brown and his son, iron-founders of Alnwick, who emigrated to New York state with the designs in 1824.<br>
<br>In 1851 Common claimed that imported American reaping machines, manufactured by Cyrus Hall McCormick, were &#145;exactly like the one I had made 40 years before&#146;. His supporters subsequently asserted that the Browns had passed Common's patterns to McCormick, but there is no evidence that the American, working in an isolated part of Virginia from 1831, ever encountered them before his reaper improvements of ten years later. Common's achievement was to demonstrate a reaping machine that foreshadowed McCormick's, employing a reciprocating action of the knives. But he failed to persevere with his invention; nor was the era of relatively abundant labour supply, and of machine breaking, propitious for its development, whereas McCormick perfected his reaper at a time favourable to its adoption by farmers in North America and Europe.<br>
<br>Common gained recognition for other inventions, including a Society of Arts silver medal for a double-drill turnip sower of 1818. Common married Mary (1778/9&#150;1847), daughter of John Leithead of Widdrington, in 1804. Two of their five sons and one of their four daughters died in infancy. He continued as an agricultural machine maker and a cartwright for the Northumberland estate until an advanced age, and he died at his home in Denwick, near Alnwick, on 28 June 1868.<br>
