<span class="headword">Rowe,  Albert Percival</span>  (1898&#150;1976), <span class="occ">scientific administrator</span>, was born on 23 March 1898 at Bush Park, Launceston, Cornwall, the son of Albert Rowe, sewing machine agent, and his wife, Mary Annie Goudge. Educated at the Royal Dockyard School, Portsmouth, he went in 1921 to the Royal College of Science, London, and joined the scientific staff of the Air Ministry the following year. In 1925 he became assistant to H. E. Wimperis, the first director of scientific research at the Air Ministry, meanwhile serving as a part-time lecturer at Imperial College, 1927&#150;37. On 18 June 1932 he married Mary Gordon (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), a solicitor, daughter of Douglas Mathews, solicitor. There were no children. Rowe acted as secretary to the Tizard committee which first met on 28 January 1935 to consider methods of defence of the country against hostile aircraft. In February 1935 he consulted R. A. Watson-Watt, the superintendent of the radio research station at Slough, about the possibility of a death ray, and his subsequent enquiry about methods of detecting aircraft by radio means led to the successful demonstration using the Daventry transmitter on 26 February 1935 and to the effective birth of British radar (then known as RDF), the initial development being carried out at Oxfordness and later Bawdsey Manor on the Suffolk coast.<br>
<br>Rowe succeeded Watson-Watt as superintendent of the Bawdsey research group in May 1938 and on the outbreak of war he made an emergency move of the establishment to Dundee. In the spring of 1940 it was transferred to the Dorset coast, and in the spring of 1942 with the threat of capture by a German parachute division another move was made to Malvern College, Worcestershire. With various changes in ministerial arrangements the name of the original Bawdsey Research Station had become the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940. Although not an active scientist during these years, Rowe guided the establishment with great success. In his office the service chiefs regularly assembled and the vital links between the operational needs and the research and development projects were forged. TRE was responsible for a host of ground based and airborne radar devices which were to exert decisive influences in many theatres of war. By the end of the war some 2000 people were working in TRE and Rowe's great achievement was the integration of so many individuals of diverse skills and temperaments into a coherent body. A commander-in-chief once complained that the most lowly assistant would not turn a screw unless he could be acquainted with the latest strategic situation in the Middle East. Indeed, it was precisely these personal contacts fostered and maintained by Rowe which so sharply distinguished the German and British scientific efforts.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Rowe moved to the Admiralty as deputy controller of research and development. Advised to move to a warmer climate for health reasons he was appointed chairman of the defence advisory committee and defence scientific adviser to the Australian government in 1947. In 1948 he published <span class="italic">One Story of Radar</span> (1948), an important account of the development of the major radar devices for which he had been responsible as chief superintendent of TRE in the Second World War. A year later he was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Adelaide but his occupation of that post was not entirely a happy one. As he revealed in his book <span class="italic">If the Gown Fits</span> (1960), his long association with defence and with service personnel was not a satisfactory preparation for entering the academic world at the age of fifty and in 1958 he retired to England and to Great Malvern, where he taught mathematics and astronomy part time at Malvern College, which led to his popular book <span class="italic">Astronomy and Cosmology</span> (1968).<br>
<br>Rowe was appointed CBE in 1942 and awarded the USA medal for merit in 1946. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Melbourne in 1955. He was elected a fellow of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in 1957 and was a governor of Malvern College from 1972. Rowe died at Bromyard Hospital, Linton, Herefordshire on 25 May 1976; he was survived by his wife.<br>
