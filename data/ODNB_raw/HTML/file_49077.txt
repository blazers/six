<span class="headword">Morgan,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1778), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was born at Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, and baptized there on 20 July 1708, the second son of Christopher Morgan, a coal factor of Kidwelly, and Sage Howell. On 29 November 1736 he married, in Llangyndeyrn, Frances Hughes (1703&#150;1773), the daughter of Arnold Bowen, the mayor of Carmarthen in 1722, and widow of Lewis Hughes, attorney and town clerk of Carmarthen, with whom she had four children. There were a further six children of her marriage to Morgan, the first two of whom suffered some form of mental handicap. It was the second son, <a name="cosubject_49078"></a><span class="headword">John Morgan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1739, <em>d.</em> 1805)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 18 December 1739 at Llangyndeyrn, who took charge of the business after the death of his father.<br>
<br>In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries there was a perceptible extension of the iron industry into west Wales, attracted by excellent supplies of water and charcoal. One prominent figure was an English ironmaster, Peter Chettle (1681&#150;1729), who owned a furnace at Pont-henri and two forges at Kidwelly and Whitland, which were sold to Lewis Hughes in 1729. Presumably these fell to Morgan when he married Hughes's widow in 1736. At all events the first distinctive contribution of Robert Morgan to the industry in this area was to bring together under common ownership a number of iron establishments: in this respect he was a consolidator rather than a pioneer. But this is to underrate his contribution both in organizing production and in seeking new markets. On the production side he built up a fully integrated enterprise from manufacturing pig iron to rolling tin plate, and to do so he bought iron ore from Lancashire and Cumberland, and tin from Cornwall. In marketing it was his restless activity which turned to producing guns during the Seven Years' War and, more abidingly, sought outlets for the newer business of tin-plate manufacture. By the late 1750s Morgan was the sole, or major, owner of a blast furnace at Carmarthen, two air furnaces, four forges&#151;at Whitland, Kidwelly, Cwmdwyfran, and Blackpool (Pembrokeshire)&#151;and a tin-plate works at Kidwelly. His blast furnaces at Carmarthen produced pig iron, which was converted into bars at the forges and then, from 1758, rolled and tinned at Kidwelly lower works, where Morgan was a partner. By the time this partnership was dissolved in 1761 he had built a new tinworks at Carmarthen.<br>
<br>For a time, during the Seven Years' War, Morgan considerably modified the production pattern to take advantage of the high profits made possible by the wartime demand for ordnance, although the difficulties of finding&#151;and keeping&#151;a reliable gun-founder made it a precarious venture. For a few years from mid-1757 guns and shot were cast for the Board of Ordnance, and guns were also supplied for merchant ships at Bristol and Liverpool. But by the late 1750s tin plate had become the stable core of the business. The scale of his activities was substantial: Carmarthen was unusual for the time in having two mills, built at a cost of &pound;3300; Morgan operated a fully integrated enterprise; there were agents in Bristol, Liverpool, and London; and he told his representative at the twice yearly meeting of ironmasters at Bristol that, because of the size of the works, &#145;you are Entitled to the First or second Vote&#146;  (National Library of Wales, Morgan letter book, 22 Jan 1761).<br>
<br>Morgan accumulated a substantial landed estate rich in woodlands for charcoal making, and about 1760 built a Georgian residence, Furnace House, in St Peter's Street, Carmarthen, complete with iron rails made in his own works. Frances Morgan died in 1773, and Morgan's own death occurred on 30 April 1778 at Furnace House (not in 1777 as generally given). He was buried in St Peter's churchyard in Carmarthen. After his death the management of the business passed to his second son, John Morgan. This met the wishes of Robert Morgan, who stated in his will that he was &#145;desirous of having the business of the iron trade carried on properly&#146; and that &#145;my son John seems to take a delight in the iron trade&#146;  (will, quoted in Green, 225). Under John Morgan, who was sheriff for Carmarthenshire in 1782, the works continued to flourish: he was one of a small group of tin-plate manufacturers recorded as meeting in London &#145;to settle prices, weights and sizes&#146;  (Minchinton, 17); and in 1800 the firm maintained three sloops to transport raw materials and finished output. However, in the latter year he leased the undertaking to a partnership including his nephew, also John Morgan. John Morgan sen. remained unmarried and died on 23 March 1805. From 1800 the enterprise was said to have declined through mismanagement, and the family connection was much reduced after the death of John Morgan jun. in 1808, although the Carmarthen works were not finally closed until 1900. Gradual decline was in any event unavoidable for a firm rooted in charcoal iron, even though some coke bars were brought from Monmouthshire from 1800 on: but Robert and John Morgan were undoubtedly pre-eminent among those who laid a tradition which made west Wales the dominant region for tin-plate production for nearly two centuries.<br>
