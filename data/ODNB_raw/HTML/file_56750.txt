<span class="headword">Eade,  Charles Stanley</span>  (1903&#150;1964), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 10 June 1903, at 100 Grove Green Road, Leytonstone, London, the son of Arthur Eade, an auctioneer, and his wife, Alice Steadman. He left school at the age of fourteen to join the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>, and also worked on <span class="italic">Lloyd's Weekly News</span>, until he moved to the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> in 1919. He first worked for the Rothermere press in 1922, when he began writing for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, founded by Alfred Harmsworth in 1903, remaining there until 1930, while also working for the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>, another Rothermere title, between 1922 and 1924, and <span class="italic">The Observer</span> from 1926 to 1930. He became the proprietor of the <span class="italic">East Ham Echo and South Essex Mail</span> in 1928. After travelling abroad for two years, he was briefly sports editor and later deputy editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, belonging to Rothermere's rival, Lord Beaverbrook, and then worked for Allied Newspapers as deputy editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Graphic</span> (1933&#150;6), and deputy editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> (1936&#150;8). He also did sports commentaries on the radio (1932&#150;8). In 1941 Eade married Vera Manwaring: they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Eade was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, another Rothermere paper, in 1938, and remained there until 1957, except for the later years of the Second World War, when he was public relations adviser to Admiral Lord Mountbatten, supreme allied commander in south-east Asia, and from 1943 to 1944 he organized newspaper and radio services for allied troops in India, Burma, and Ceylon. In 1953, in an effort to improve the circulation of the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span> in the face of competition from Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, Eade selected the American best-selling historical novel <span class="italic">Forever Amber</span> (1944), by Kathleen Winsor, for serialization in the paper. Despite Randolph Churchill's attack on the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span> for publishing what Churchill regarded as pornography, Eade succeeded in adding 400,000 to the circulation figures, and continued to publish more of the same kind of material. However, later in the 1950s the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span> began to lose money, and in 1961 Rothermere closed it down and sold the title to Beaverbrook Newspapers.<br>
<br>During the war Eade edited five volumes of the war speeches of Winston Churchill to the House of Commons, publishing one a year beginning with <span class="italic">The Widening Struggle</span> (1942) and ending with <span class="italic">Victory</span> (1946). After the war he compiled Churchill's <span class="italic">Secret Session Speeches</span> (1946), speeches made to the House of Commons in secret session between 1940 and 1942. There were five major speeches that had not been recorded, even for official purposes, and after the House of Commons agreed in December 1945 that they need no longer be kept secret, Churchill passed his notes to Eade, giving him authority to publish them. The first of these speeches was made on 20 June 1940, when Churchill told parliament that if Hitler failed to invade Britain, he had lost the war. On 17 September 1940 he gave details of how parliament would carry on sitting despite the air raids; on 25 June 1941 he reported on the grave shipping losses in the Atlantic; he spoke to the Commons on 23 April 1942 after the fall of Singapore, and on 10 December 1942 explained the reasons for recognizing Admiral Darlan as the French leader in north Africa. This was followed by <span class="italic">Churchill by his Contemporaries</span> (1953), edited by Eade, a series of short articles by people who had known and worked with Churchill, including Eisenhower.<br>
<br>Eade was a director of Associated Newspapers from 1947, a member of the Press Council from 1956 to 1957, and from 1961, and he sat on the council of the Commonwealth Press Union. He died on 27 August 1964 at his home, Bleak House, Broadstairs, Kent, and was buried on 1 September.<br>
