<span class="headword">Pinck,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1573, <em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was probably born at Kempshott in the parish of Winslade, Hampshire, and was baptized in Dummer Chapel there on 1 March 1573, the eldest son of Henry Pincke (<i>d</i>. 1611) of Kempshott, and of his second wife, Elizabeth (1544/5&#150;1625), daughter of John Page of Sevington, Hampshire. In 1588 he entered Winchester College and on 26 May 1594 was admitted to New College, Oxford, matriculating soon after on 14 June. Elected fellow in 1596, he graduated BA on 27 April 1598 and proceeded MA on 21 January 1602. In 1610 he was elected senior proctor of the university. On his father's death in 1611 he inherited Kempshott, but remained in Oxford. On 19 November 1612 he became BMed and sought a licence to practise. His ordination as deacon on 25 November 1614 suggests a clerical and theological reorientation, and perhaps that he had in sight the wardenship of New College to which, in 1617, on the resignation of Arthur Lake, he was duly elected with an anticipatory royal letter of support. In 1619 he took the degrees of BD and DD, and on 14 July 1620 New College presented him to the rectory of Stanton St John, Oxfordshire, to which benefice he added only Colerne, Wiltshire, many years later in 1645.<br>
<br>In 1629 Pinck was nominated a delegate for the reform of university statutes promoted by William Laud, and was sufficiently prosperous to fund conversion of a disused chantry chapel at Winchester College into a library. By this time, however, following efforts by the warden and seniors to eradicate abuses and waste, New College's large fellowship was bitterly divided, and the visitor, Bishop Richard Neile of Winchester, failed to restore peace. In 1630 the fellows were further split by a disputed election to the wardenship of Winchester College, in which the candidate favoured by Bishop William Laud, recently chosen the university's chancellor, was strongly backed by Pinck. Malcontents, encouraged by Laud's enemies, elected another candidate. Secretary Windebanke's son, John, who spent ten years in Pinck's care, recalled the warden's retiring disposition and failure to mix either with fellows or with leading university figures. In late 1630 Laud advised Pinck to associate with other heads to strengthen his hand internally. Pinck thanked him for securing him intimacy with &#145;this good master of ours&#146;, presumably Bishop Neile, and with a company of friends whom he had &#145;ever applauded &hellip; in their freindlie conv[e]rsing one with the other&#146;  (Oxford, New College Archives, 3098).<br>
<br>In 1633 Pinck was nominated a delegate for the university press. Laud chose him vice-chancellor in July 1634, and again a year later. To Anthony Wood, Pinck &#145;was a zealous defender of the university privileges and liberties&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.226). Alongside the keeper of the archives, Bryan Twyne, he fought the citizens of Oxford over courts leet, felons' goods, markets, alehouses, and other disputed matters. Pinck even discommoned recalcitrant tradesmen. He helped Twyne obtain in 1635 a new charter which substantially reinforced academic privilege. The most delicate issue of his mandate was Laud's claim to metropolitical visitation as archbishop. For a year before Laud achieved a favourable royal verdict in June 1636 Pinck discreetly helped Twyne prepare counter-arguments, but kept a low profile to avoid breaking with the chancellor; that same June, just before leaving his office, Pinck arranged the formalities of reception by convocation of a final revision of the new code of statutes which Laud had promoted.<br>
<br>Of Pinck's political loyalties there was no doubt, and as the break between Charles I and parliament approached he showed himself a thorough royalist. Like several other heads he took the protestation in February 1642 only with major reservations. On the hasty departure of Dr John Prideaux in summer 1642 the university chose Pinck to exercise the functions of vice-chancellor for a third time. He mustered scholars and had them drilled in New College. In August he welcomed Sir John Byron's royal troopers and was denounced to Speaker Lenthall by the city's MPs. In early September he wrote to Laud's successor as chancellor, Philip Herbert, earl of Pembroke, seeking protection, and received a sharp rebuke in reply. Both letters were printed by order of parliament. He went to treat with parliamentary forces under the command of Lord Saye and Sele near Aylesbury. There he was arrested on 10 September and sent to London where on 12 September he was imprisoned. Later that month Saye searched Pinck's Oxford study for incriminating papers, but exhibited displeasure when a trooper destroyed the warden's gilt alabaster bust of the king. Pinck's release on bail was ordered on 5 January 1643. He was soon back in Oxford and, after the marquess of Hertford became chancellor, Pinck was twice more chosen vice-chancellor, on 18 November 1643 and 24 August 1644.<br>
<br>Renowned for his charitable disposition&#151;exhibited a decade earlier in efforts to clear the debts of an imprisoned Wykehamist, Thomas Lydiat&#151;Pinck obtained in 1644 New College chaplaincies for Peter Gunning and Isaac Barrow, royalist refugees from Cambridge, as well as for Richard Sherlock. Another chaplaincy found for the promising Ralph Brideoake of Brasenose College was to be repaid when, as post-Restoration bishop of Chichester, the beneficiary raised a monument to Pinck in New College chapel. Pinck died on 2 November 1647 several days after a severe fall in his lodgings at New College, and was buried in the chapel on 6 November. He was a man of considerable means. By his will dated 22 May 1647 he left his manor of Kempshott and pastures nearby to his nephew Henry Pinck; the patronage of the rectory of Wootton, Oxfordshire, which he had recently purchased for &pound;500, to New College; &pound;110 to purchase an annuity for apprenticing young people in Stanton St John parish; and many other generous legacies.<br>
<br>Pinck published in his lifetime only the many poems he contributed to commemorative academic collections between 1596 and 1641. John Lamphire published in 1680 his questions for academic exercises accompanied by his references to ancient, medieval, and near-contemporary works that discussed them, <span class="italic">Quaestiones selectiores in logica, ethica, physica, &amp; metaphysica, inter authores celebriores repertae</span>. This has been called &#145;a good cram-book for the Oxford disputants&#146;  (Madan, 3.387). A manuscript, &#145;Gesta vicecancellariatus sui&#146;, covering his first period as vice-chancellor and including some of his speeches, was used by Wood but has since disappeared. A pamphlet of verses by four friends or pupils, <span class="italic">In honour of the Right Worshipfull Doctor Robert Pinke, doctour of divinitie, and warden of New Colledge in Oxford</span> (1648), praised the warden's learning, advancement of friends, and kindness to the poor.<br>
