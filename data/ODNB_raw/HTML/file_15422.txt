<span class="headword">Kent,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1410, <em>d.</em> 1469), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was presumably of Kentish ancestry and &#145;of gentle birth&#146;. He was probably at Oxford before going to Italy, where he lectured on canon and civil law at the University of Pavia in 1440&#150;41, and became a doctor of both laws by 1442. He returned to England soon afterwards and briefly held two London rectories before being appointed in March 1444 to succeed Adam Moleyns (<i>d</i>. 1450) as secondary of the privy seal office and clerk of the king's council. This appointment gave him considerable authority and he frequently signed council warrants. In 1445 he was appointed under-constable of England with a salary of 100 marks a year, and was seen as one of the court faction who in the parliament of November 1450 were alleged to have been &#145;misbehaving about your royal person&#146;, and whose members were to be excluded from the king's presence  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 5.216). It had no effect upon Kent, who, apart from his activities at the council, was very frequently sent on diplomatic missions to France, Burgundy, Prussia, Scotland, Brittany, and Spain. In July 1455, for both excessive service and old age, he was granted an indult permitting him to avoid fasting in Lent. He appears to have avoided political involvement, for he retained his appointment under Edward IV, though by 1462 he was ceasing to play any real part in the affairs of the council. He did, however, play an important part in the negotiations of 1467 for the marriage of Edward's sister Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1503) to Charles, duke of Burgundy.<br>
<br>Kent lived in the parish of St James Garlickhythe, London, and was a citizen of London. He appears to have married twice&#151;first, by 1451, Isobel, and second, Joan, widow of Thomas Dounton of London, who survived him. His will, made in January 1469, asked that he be buried next to his first wife, Isobel, in St James Garlickhythe. Kent bequeathed a long list of canon- and civil-law books, which he donated to the use of the prerogative court of Canterbury if housed in a suitable building near St Paul's Cathedral: if not, they were to go to All Souls College, Oxford. There is mention in the will of landed property in London and in various places in Kent, including Headcorn, Langley, and Brussyng, and also a tenement and land in Bishop's Lynn, Norfolk. Kent appointed as executors his wife and two former subordinates in the privy seal office, Richard Langport and William Tilghman. He died between 9 January and 15 March 1469: there is no evidence that he left any children.<br>
