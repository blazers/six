<span class="headword">Mayo,  Thomas</span>  (1790&#150;1871), <span class="occ">physician</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18459/', "John Mayo (1761&#150;1818)")</script> and his wife, Ann, the daughter of Thomas Cock, was born in London on 24 January 1790. He was the brother of the physiologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18458/', "Herbert Mayo (1796&#150;1852)")</script>. He began his education under the Revd John Smith of Eltham, and then after eighteen months at Westminster School he was transferred to the private tuition of the Revd George Richards, vicar of Bampton, Oxfordshire. He entered Oriel College, Oxford, in 1807, and obtained a first class <i>in literis humanioribus</i> in 1811. He was elected a fellow of Oriel on 23 April 1813:<blockquote>to the attainment of which honour I had pledged myself to my father, provided he would permit me to escape the Foundation of Westminster and its peculiar training, which combined with a very fair proportion of Latin and Greek occasional aerostation in a blanket. (Munk)</blockquote>Mayo graduated MA in 1814, BM in 1815, and DM in 1818.<br>
<br>On his father's death Mayo succeeded to his lucrative practice at Tunbridge Wells. In 1835 he settled in London, where he lived at 56 Wimpole Street. He became FRCP in 1819 and censor of the Royal College of Physicians in 1835, 1839, and 1850. He delivered the Lumleian lectures in 1839 and 1842, the Harveian oration in 1841, and the Croonian lectures in 1853, and he was named an elect in 1847. In 1835 he became FRS, and in 1841 physician to the Marylebone Infirmary. He was also physician-in-ordinary to the duke of Sussex. On 5 January 1857 he was elected president of the Royal College of Physicians, a post to which he was annually re-elected until 1862. Mayo was therefore president during the passing of the <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> of 1858, and in his colleges offices had been closely concerned with questions of reform for a number of years.<br>
<br>Mayo was the last president chosen by the ancient system, and the last elect chosen by his brother-elects  (Clark, 725). In his pamphlet <span class="italic">Medical Examinations and Physicians' Requirements Considered</span> (1857), published soon after his election as president, Mayo stressed the value of a classical education and warned against competitive examinations &#145;as likely to produce a knowledge which was neither lasting nor sufficiently wide&#146;  (Clark, 725).<br>
<br>Mayo was also something of an authority on mental illness, and he published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Relation of the Theory of Morals to Insanity</span> (1831) and <span class="italic">Elements of Pathology of the Human Mind</span> (1838). His Croonian lecture, &#145;Medical testimony in cases of lunacy&#146; was published in 1854. Mayo repeatedly rejected medico-psychological attempts to reform the law and opposed the insanity plea. After one case <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> criticized him for propounding &#145;not evidence but metaphysical speculations; and to apply to a living fellow-creature his famous doctrines of abstract mental disease, of insane responsibility, and the propriety of making madmen the subject of criminal punishment&#146;  (Smith, 138). In 1860 Mayo delivered a remarkable address at the Royal Institution, entitled &#145;Relations of the public to the science and practice of medicine&#146;.<br>
<br>Mayo was twice married; first, to Lydia, daughter of John Bill MD of Farley Hall, Staffordshire; and second to Susan Mary, widow of Rear-Admiral Sir William Symonds, and daughter of the Revd John Briggs, fellow of Eton College. He had seven children (by his first marriage only), including Augustus Frederick Mayo, barrister; the Revd Robert Mayo; and Charles Thomas Mayo of Corsham, Wiltshire. In 1862 Mayo retired from practice, to live first at Yarmouth, on the Isle of Wight, and then with his son Charles at Corsham, where he died on 13 January 1871, and where he was buried.<br>
