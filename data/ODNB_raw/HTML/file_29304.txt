<span class="headword">Whitfeld,  John  Clarke-</span>  (1770&#150;1836), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, son of John Clarke (<i>d</i>. 17 Sept 1802) of Malmesbury, Wiltshire, was born on 13 December 1770 at Gloucester, and adopted by letters patent in 1814 the family name of his mother, Amphillis (<i>d</i>. 10 Nov 1813), daughter of Henry Whitfeld of The Bury, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>After a musical training at Oxford under Philip Hayes, in 1789 Clarke obtained the post of organist in the parish church of Ludlow, and the following year he married. In 1793 he took the BMus degree at Oxford, and in 1794 he succeeded Richard Langton as organist and master of the choristers at Armagh Cathedral for three years. In 1795 he was awarded the honorary degree of MusD at Dublin University, and in March 1798 he was appointed choirmaster of St Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church, Dublin. His earliest glees and sonatas were written and partly published in Ireland; but the unsettled condition of the country at length induced him to resign his posts, and after returning to England, he settled at Cambridge, where he became the organist and choirmaster of Trinity and St John's colleges from 1799 to 1820. He dedicated his three volumes of <span class="italic">Services and Anthems</span> (1800&#150;05) to the masters and fellows of the two colleges.<br>
<br>In 1799 Clarke was granted the degree MusD Cambridge <i>ad eundem</i> from Dublin, and in 1810 he was incorporated DMus at Oxford. In 1821, on the death of Charles Hague, Clarke-Whitfeld, as he had become, was appointed professor of music at the University of Cambridge, a post which he held until his death. To allow more opportunity for composition he retired to the nearby village of Chesterton, where he set to music many of Sir Walter Scott's verses. He also worked equally industriously on the poems of Byron and Joanna Baillie, and set their words to music in some hundred songs and partsongs. About 1814 he published two volumes of <span class="italic">Twelve Vocal Pieces</span>, for which original material was contributed by these and other poets.<br>
<br>From 1820 to 1832 Clarke-Whitfeld was organist and choirmaster of Hereford Cathedral, and in this capacity he was frequently asked to conduct or to play the piano at the Three Choirs festivals. At the Hereford festival of 1822 he produced his oratorio <span class="italic">The Crucifixion</span>, and at that of 1825 its continuation, <span class="italic">The Resurrection</span> (published in 1835). He resigned in 1832 after an attack of paralysis and died at Holmer, near Hereford, on 22 February 1836. A mural tablet recorded his burial in the bishop's cloisters, Hereford Cathedral. He was survived by his wife, Susannah, who died on 18 April 1845, aged seventy-two.<br>
<br>Clarke-Whitfeld's work was well adapted to his times and popular. He did valuable pioneering work in editing the scores of Purcell, Arne, and Handel, and his collections of <span class="italic">Favourite Anthems</span> (1805) and <span class="italic">Single and Double Chants</span> (1810) were compiled with good judgement.<br>
