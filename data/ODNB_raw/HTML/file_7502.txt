<span class="headword">Dennis,  James Blatch Piggott</span>  (1815&#150;1861), <span class="occ">palaeontologist and natural historian</span>, was born, possibly at Colchester, on 4 August 1815, the son of Philip Dennis, an army officer. After attending Bedford School from 1830 to 1833 he was admitted to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1835. He graduated in 1839 and was ordained a minister in the Church of England. Two years later, on 30 November 1841, at Heworth, co. Durham, he married a minor, Eliza Potts, daughter of Mathew Potts.<br>
<br>During 1848 James Dennis produced two pamphlets under the pseudonym Lucius debating Lord John Russell's ecclesiastical policy. He also wrote a tract in his own name, <span class="italic">Rites and Ceremonies in the Church and the Apostolic Succession</span>. In 1850 he was appointed curate at St James's Church in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, but resigned his curacy two years later to become a master at the local King Edward VI Grammar School. An active figure in local intellectual life, he organized geological and natural history displays with lectures and study groups in the town's museum.<br>
<br>From Bury St Edmunds Dennis frequently visited the Norfolk broads to study bird life. In accordance with the ornithological attitudes of the time he shot and stuffed many birds; he sent fifty specimens to the Great Exhibition. At Stonesfield in Oxfordshire he discovered the fossil jawbone of <i>Stereognathus ooliticus</i>, a previously unknown Jurassic mammal. Richard Owen's subsequent study of the jawbone, published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Geological Society</span> in 1856, led to Dennis's election as a fellow of the Geological Society.<br>
<br>In 1856 and 1857 Dennis published articles on the microscopic study of bones and fossils in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Science</span>. A paper on the origin of mammals, based on investigations of fossils from Lyme Regis in Dorset, put forward a theory on the bone structure of animals with the power of springing movement. Other contributions discussed cetacean fossils from Felixstowe in Suffolk, and evidence for the origin of birds from fossils found at Stonesfield. In 1860, at the Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he delivered a paper on pterodactyl flight, based on researches into fossils from the Cambridgeshire coprolite beds.<br>
<br>Dennis retired from his post at the Bury St Edmunds grammar school in 1857. In the following year he published <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. Ballie</span> (a member of the Church of England who had converted to Roman Catholicism), arguing the two churches' relative merits. He died of &#145;brain disease&#146; at his house in Garland Street, Bury St Edmunds, on 13 January 1861, and was buried in the town cemetery. His wife survived him, and after his death the trustees of the town's museum organized a subscription and exhibition to purchase his ornithological collections and provide for his family.<br>
