<span class="headword">Sayers <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>&Oacute; Gaoith&iacute;n or &Oacute; Guith&iacute;n]</span>,  Peig</span>  (1873&#150;1958), <span class="occ">storyteller</span>, was born in Vicarstown, co. Kerry, in 1873 (she was baptized on 29 March 1873), one of thirteen children born to Tom&aacute;s Sayers, small farmer and labourer, and his wife, Peig N&iacute; Bhrosnach&aacute;in, only four of whom survived to adulthood. From the age of six she was educated in the national school at Dunquin, co. Kerry, but left school early to go into domestic service with a shopkeeper's family in Dingle, where she remained for four years until health problems forced her to return home. She then thought to emigrate to America and in order to secure the funds for such a journey she went into service for a second time. She was very unhappy with her position in this second household and again returned home. Her brother made a match for her with a man from the Blasket Islands, P&aacute;draig &#145;Flint&#146; &Oacute; Gaoith&iacute;n (<i>c</i>.1862&#150;<i>c</i>.1920), a farmer and fisherman. The couple married on 13 February 1892 and went to live on Great Blasket Island, initially with &Oacute; Gaoith&iacute;n's parents. By 1911 Peig had given birth to ten children, of whom seven survived into adulthood. Of the adult children one died tragically in a fall from a cliff, and five emigrated to America.<br>
<br>Peig Sayers was the most renowned storyteller from west Kerry. Robin Flower, the noted scholar, wrote that Peig:<blockquote>is one of the finest speakers on the Island &hellip; she is wont to illustrate her talks with tales, long and short, which come in naturally along the flow of conversation, and lighten up all our discourse of the present with the wit and wisdom and folly and vivid incident of the past. (<span class="italic">The Western Island, or, The Great Blasket</span>, 1944)</blockquote>Peig told her stories in her home, to neighbours and visitors; with the ability to remember and reinterpret folk-tales, legends, and local history, her stories included references to proverbs, folk practices and beliefs, and traditional prayers and blessings. A collection of her stories and anecdotes about life on the Great Blasket was published as <span class="italic">Machtnamh seana-mhn&aacute;</span> (1939) and translated into English by Sean Ennis as <span class="italic">An Old Woman's Reflections</span> (1962). In the introduction to the translation, W. R. Rogers noted some features of Peig's storytelling prowess:<blockquote>Great artist and wise woman that she was, Peig would at once switch from gravity to gaiety, for she was a light-hearted woman, and her changes of mood and face were like the changes of running water. As she talked her hands would be moving too; a little clap of the palms to cap a phrase, a flash of the thumb over the shoulder to mark a mystery, a hand hushed to mouth for mischief or whispered secrecy.</blockquote>While Peig could neither read nor write Irish she dictated her autobiography in Irish to her son, with the encouragement of the scholar M&aacute;ire N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide. Published as <span class="italic">Peig</span> in 1936, it was awarded the Chraoibhin prize in 1937. A mine of information about life on the Great Blasket, <span class="italic">Peig</span> was a set school text for Irish school children from 1936 until it was removed from the secondary school syllabus in 1995. The writer Bryan MacMahon translated the book into English in 1973.<br>
<br>In 1942 Peig Sayers moved back to the mainland to live with her son in Vicarstown. She died in Dingle Hospital on 8 December 1958 and was buried in the cemetery at Dunquin.<br>
