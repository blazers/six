<span class="headword">Bourn,  Samuel</span>  (1689&#150;1754), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Calne in Wiltshire, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2999/', "Samuel Bourn (1648&#150;1720)")</script>, dissenting minister, and his wife, Miss Scortwreth. He was taught classics at Bolton and trained for the Presbyterian ministry at the Manchester academy of John Chorlton and James Coningham. He became minister at Crook, near Kendal, in 1711. Probably in the same year he married Hannah Harrison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1768), of Kendal. They had nine children, three of whom died before adulthood. Of their six surviving sons, two became ministers: Joseph (1713&#150;1765) at Congleton and then Hindley, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3001/', "Samuel Bourn (1714&#150;1796)")</script> at Norwich. Abraham, who was a surgeon in Market Harborough, Leicester, and Liverpool, wrote several pamphlets in defence of dissent. Benjamin became a London bookseller, publishing some of his father's works, and wrote <span class="italic">A Sure Guide to Hell</span> (1750). Daniel built an early cotton mill at Leominster, and Miles was a mercer in Dudley.<br>
<br>At first doctrinally orthodox, Bourn's intention not to subscribe to the Westminster assembly catechism at his ordination prompted a number of local ministers to boycott the occasion. When in 1719 the Salters' Hall conference made the trinitarian controversy a burning question among dissenters, Bourn, hitherto &#145;a professed Athanasian&#146;, studied the writings of Samuel Clarke and Daniel Waterland, and accepted Clarke's heterodox scheme. In his ministry at Crook he dedicated a child (probably of Baptist parentage) without baptism, according to a form printed in the memoirs of him by Toulmin. In 1720 he succeeded Henry Winder (<i>d</i>. 1752) at Tunley, near Wigan. He declined a call to the neighbouring congregation of Park Lane but accepted one (dated 29 December 1727) to the new chapel at Chorley. On 7 May 1731 he was chosen as one of the Monday lecturers at Bolton, a post which he held along with his Chorley pastorate.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1732 Bourn preached the opening sermon at the New Meeting in Birmingham, which replaced the Lower Meeting, and on 21 and 23 April he was called to be colleague with Thomas Pickard in joint charge of the congregation and a larger one at Coseley. He and his family moved to Coseley and he began his ministry on 25 June. Harassed by the JP John Ward of Sedgley Park, who sought to make him take a parish apprentice, Bourn twice successfully appealed to the quarter sessions. Ward then tried to remove him from Sedgley parish to his last legal settlement on the pretext that he was likely to become chargeable to the parish, to which Bourn wrote a spirited reply, later published by Toulmin. After Pickard's death, Bourn was joined by Samuel Blyth MD. His new colleague was hot-tempered and set about attacking field preachers and Quakers.<br>
<br>Bourn corresponded with Philip Doddridge, with Groome, vicar of Sedgley, and with the Kidderminster dissenters on the subject of subscription. In his catechetical instructions he &#145;improved upon&#146; the assembly's catechism. Strongly believing that family religion was the first step towards national reformation, Bourn published prayers and catechisms for all age groups. His polemical points in his pamphlets centred on his suspicion of human formulas of doctrine: he accused protestant systematizers of doctrine of behaving like the pope in requiring allegiance to their schemes and urged that confessional subscription should be avoided. He disapproved of the use of technical theological terms not found in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and was equally suspicious of enthusiasm. He argued that an &#145;Arian&#146; interpretation of the Trinity was appropriate because the orthodox view of the identity of substance of the three persons precluded the idea of equality between them. The Particular Baptist theologian John Gill attacked these views in his defence of Calvinist orthodoxy.<br>
<br>On 18 September 1745 Bourn delivered the charge at the ordination of Job Orton at High Chapel, Shrewsbury, and on 12 September 1750 he &#145;prayed over&#146; Noah Jones at his ordination at Pensnett meeting-house, Cradley. In 1751 he declined a call to succeed John Buck (<i>d</i>. 1750) in his father's congregation at Bolton. He died at Coseley of paralysis on 22 March 1754. He was small, slight, active, and sharp-eyed and somewhat dishevelled in appearance. Although his reputation for heterodoxy went before him, he was seldom polemical in the pulpit and his prayers were notable. With hindsight Joseph Priestley, who ministered at the Birmingham New Meeting from 1780 to 1791, said that his Congregation was &#145;the most liberal, I believe of any in England; and to this freedom the unwearied labours of Mr Bourn eminently contributed&#146;  (Priestley, 1.339).<br>
