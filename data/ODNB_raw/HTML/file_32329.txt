<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cave,  George</span>, Viscount Cave  (1856&#150;1928), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 23 February 1856 at 67 Cheapside, London, the second son of Thomas Cave (1825&#150;1894), a City of London merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (1827/8&#150;1925), daughter of Jasper Shallcrass of Banstead, Surrey, who were married in 1849. Cave's father was sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1863&#150;4 and Liberal MP for Barnstaple from 1865 to 1880; his mother outlived her husband by thirty years, dying at the age of ninety-seven. His elder brother, Thomas, became a solicitor, and of his two younger brothers Edmund became a master of the Supreme Court and Basil was consul-general in Zanzibar and was knighted. In 1866, Cave was sent to the Lyc&eacute;e Imp&eacute;rial de Caen, where he stayed for three years. He then went to Merchant Taylors' School, London. In 1874 he gained a closed scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, where he also held a Pitt Club exhibition and a Taylorian exhibition in French. Cave was a successful scholar: he obtained first-class honours in classical moderations in 1875 and went on to be in the first class in Greats in 1878. In 1916 he was made an honorary fellow of his college. He attempted an All Souls fellowship but was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In May 1876 Cave was admitted to the Inner Temple, and in June 1880 he was called to the bar and took up practice in chambers at 26 Old Buildings, Lincoln's Inn. He soon gained a steady if not brilliant practice at the Chancery bar. By 1890 he was earning &pound;1000 a year and by 1904 between &pound;4000 and &pound;5000. On 6 January 1885 he married (Anne) Estella Sarah Penfold Mathews (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of William Witney Mathews of Chard, Somerset. They had one child, who died at birth.<br>
<br>Cave's father had been active in local government in Richmond-on-Thames, Surrey, and in 1886 George Cave was elected to Richmond vestry. In 1890, after Richmond was incorporated, he was elected to the new Richmond borough council. He went on to be a member of Surrey county council. In 1892 he was made alderman and in 1897 became deputy lieutenant of Surrey. Cave became chairman of Surrey quarter sessions in 1894. Here his advice was influential in the nomination of candidates to the magistracy. In 1904 he took silk and became a bencher of his inn in 1912. He was appointed attorney-general to the prince of Wales in 1914.<h2>
<a name="Conservativepoliticianhomesecretaryandlawlord"></a>Conservative politician, home secretary, and law lord</h2>Cave was elected to parliament in 1906 as Conservative MP for Kingston upon Thames and was re-elected subsequently until he was elevated to the peerage. His parliamentary style was quiet, unemotional, and persuasive and he was valued for his tactful approach to difficult problems. He made his name in 1908 with his speech opposing the <span class="roman">Licensing Bill</span>, where his experience as a licensing justice in Surrey was of considerable value. From 1905 to 1909 he was a member of the royal commission on land transfer. In 1913 Cave moved the minority report of the select committee which inquired into the circumstances surrounding the purchase of shares in the American Marconi Company by Sir Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George (then chancellor of the exchequer), and Sir Rufus Isaacs. This condemned their conduct as a &#145;grave impropriety&#146;. Cave emphasized the concern that the head of the Treasury, who &#145;desires the respect of the City of London&#146;, was unwise to engage in such transactions  (Heuston, 413).<br>
<br>In the debates on the 1913 <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, Cave followed the Unionist view that Ulster must either be persuaded to be included under the terms of the bill or be excluded by parliament. He went further than his party in claiming that such an important change in the constitution of Ireland required the assent of the electors, saying that if the Liberal government failed to hold a referendum before the bill was passed, the king would be entitled to dissolve parliament without the consent of the prime minister. Here he was supported by both Dicey and Anson, who argued that the king had power to dissolve parliament in order to secure the consent of electors to fundamental change. Lord Esher dissented, pointing out that Cave's view was contrary to the provisions of the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> 1701 and would bring the king into party politics, which &#145;No loyal subject could contemplate without misgivings&#146;. In a letter to Asquith, Birrell thought it was &#145;odd that a mouldy Equity draftsman and conveyancer should be so <i>bold</i>&#146;  (Heuston, 414). The issue of the king's prerogative arose later, in 1923, when Cave was lord chancellor. On the ground that the king must be kept out of political debates, he advised Stamfordham that the king could not be bound to grant a dissolution to Ramsay MacDonald if the minority Labour government were defeated in the house.<br>
<br>In 1915, unusually for a back-bencher, Cave was sworn of the privy council and was knighted. That autumn Carson resigned as attorney-general and F. E. Smith secured the succession for himself, with Cave as solicitor-general. They appeared for the crown in the prosecution of Roger Casement for high treason in 1916. In a contentious decision, F. E. made a formal request to Cave to support his decision not to allow Casement to appeal to the House of Lords, with which Cave concurred. Cave became home secretary in December 1916. In that capacity, he agreed that the chief secretary for Ireland could allow &#145;a Roman Catholic dignitary&#146; to examine the controversial Casement diaries. One of his first acts as home secretary was to steer through the bill which doubled the size of the electorate, reduced seven franchise qualifications to three, and gave the vote to women over thirty. During the passage of the bill he was offered the mastership of the rolls, to which as a Chancery lawyer he would have been well suited, but he declined it. In June 1918 he led a mission to The Hague to negotiate an agreement with the German government over the exchange of prisoners of war. In August that year, he offered his resignation when the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned in the wake of a police strike. It was refused.<br>
<br>On 13 November 1918 Cave was appointed a lord of appeal in ordinary and was created a viscount. He did not surrender the seals as home secretary until 14 January 1919 which created the odd situation of a law lord discharging the duties of a cabinet minister.<br>
<br>In 1919 Cave led a commission to South Africa to decide on the appropriate compensation to be awarded to the British South Africa Company for the loss of investment in Southern Rhodesia. The question had been who owned the land: the British South Africa Company, the Matabele (Ndebele) people, the white settlers, or the British crown. Originally referred to the judicial committee in 1914, the case was heard in 1918. The judicial committee held that the unoccupied lands were held by the crown, and the question remained of compensation to the British South Africa Company for developing the land. Cave's commission set the compensation at &pound;4.5million, half the company claim. Cave received the GCMG for this task.<h2>
<a name="Lordchancellor"></a>Lord chancellor</h2>On the formation of the Bonar Law cabinet in October 1922 Cave was made lord chancellor. His appointment was due to the refusal of the post by Pollock, who had opposed Bonar Law at the Carlton Club meeting of the Conservative Party on their continued membership of the coalition. Cave was reappointed by Baldwin in 1923, and served as lord chancellor until the election of January 1924. When Haldane, who was in failing health, was made lord chancellor, Cave helped him by continuing to perform his judicial duties during Haldane's ten-month tenure. Cave resumed office as lord chancellor in November 1924, and held it until his death in March 1928.<br>
<br>Cave's approach as lord chancellor was orthodox. He made reforms to advisory committees responsible for appointing magistrates, making members retire by rotation every three years and fixing their term of appointment to six years. He was instrumental in seeing through the <span class="roman">Law of Property Act</span> 1925, and its six ancillary statutes, which together modernized and simplified the law governing the ownership and transfer of land in England and Wales. They were the fruit of many years' work by many hands and much debate. They were opposed by large sections of the legal profession, and Cave himself had spoken against the reforms when Birkenhead promoted them in 1922. But when they were reintroduced later the same year, after Cave had taken office as lord chancellor, he accepted that they must pass. All seven acts became law in 1925. Cave also presided over the passing of the <span class="roman">Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act</span> 1925 clarifying and reforming the law governing the administration of the courts. In 1926 Cave was criticized for his handling of a debate on the <span class="roman">Trades Disputes Bill</span> in the wake of the general strike. When Labour peers tried to filibuster, and the leader of the house moved the closure, Cave accepted the motion without a debate. A debate followed over the next four days on the propriety of Cave's judgment; Lord Ullswater, who had been speaker from 1910 to 1913, questioned Cave's decision, but Cave refused to admit he was wrong.<br>
<br>In 1925 Cave was approached to stand as chancellor of the University of Oxford. He was very reluctant, as he and others felt that should he lose against the other candidate, Asquith, it would reflect badly on the Conservative Party, and only after considerable persuasion did he accept. Cave was elected, owing to the votes of people described by Asquith as &#145;cavemen&#146;: &#145;half literate followers in rural parsonages&#146;  (Koss, 275).<br>
<br>Cave died at his Somerset home, St Ann's, Burnham-on-Sea, on 29 March 1928, and was buried at St Mary's, Berrow. He had sent his resignation to Baldwin a week earlier and the day before he died he was told that he had been made an earl; his widow was subsequently granted the title Countess Cave of Richmond. For a successful barrister, he left surprisingly little money, and Hailsham arranged for a number of people to subscribe to an annuity to support his widow.<br>
