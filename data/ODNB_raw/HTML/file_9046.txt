<span class="headword">Eyton,  Thomas Campbell</span>  (1809&#150;1880), <span class="occ">naturalist and agriculturist</span>, was born at Eyton Hall, Wellington, Shropshire, on 10 September 1809, the son of Thomas Eyton (1777&#150;1855), recorder of Wenlock, and later high sheriff of Shropshire, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1780&#150;1817), daughter of Major-General Donald Campbell. Eyton is mainly known as an ornithologist, having become interested in natural history at an early age. Admitted pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1827, he matriculated the following year, but left without taking a degree. He became the friend and correspondent of Charles Darwin, John Gould, Louis Agassiz, Alfred Russel Wallace, Richard Owen, and Sir William Jardine, and many other naturalists of the time.<br>
<br>On 13 May 1835 Eyton married Elizabeth Frances (1813?&#150;1870), daughter and coheir of Robert Aglionby Slaney (1792&#150;1862) of Walford and Hatton, MP for Shrewsbury for twenty-three years; they had seven children.<br>
<br>In 1836 Eyton published the first volume of his <span class="italic">History of the Rarer British Birds</span>, with woodcuts by a local engraver, Mark, which have been compared with Thomas Bewick's for fidelity. In the same year appeared his second volume, <span class="italic">Catalogue of British Birds</span>; for this he was patron to Edward Lear, employing him for the illustrations. In 1838 Eyton published his elaborate <span class="italic">Monograph of the Anatidae, or Duck Tribe</span>, which included descriptions of several new ducks to science. On coming into possession of the family estate on the death of his father in 1855, Eyton built a spacious museum at Eyton Hall, in which he formed one of the finest collections of skins and skeletons of birds in Europe. The skeletons were mostly prepared and mounted by his own hands. In 1867 (with supplements in 1869 and 1873&#150;5) Eyton employed Mr Hobson of Wellington as publisher for <span class="italic">Osteologia avium</span> (1867), a voluminous work on the skeletons of birds, illustrated from the specimens in his own museum. He also compiled <span class="italic">Eyton's Catalogue of Species of Birds in his Possession</span> (1858), <span class="italic">A Synopsis of the Duck Tribe</span> (1869), and a catalogue of the skeletons of birds in his museum. His last publication was a final supplement to his fine work <span class="italic">Osteologia avium</span> in 1878.<br>
<br>Although the contents of his museum were sold after Eyton's death, many of his specimens (both skeletons and cabinet skins) have survived in museums such as the Natural History Museum (Tring), the Liverpool Museum, Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, and the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Many of these specimens are of great importance to zoology and in several cases are the &#145;types&#146; (or standards) on which that species is based. Eyton named several birds himself, including <i>Arachnothera flavigaster</i>, the spectacled spiderhunter from Indo-China, and <i>Dendrocygna eytoni</i>, the plumed whistling duck from Australia, which is often alternatively called Eyton's tree duck. Several species of bird were named after Eyton, notably a Brazilian woodcreeper (<i>Xiphorhynchus guttatus eytoni</i>) by Philip Lutley Sclater, the first editor of <span class="italic">Ibis</span>, in 1853.<br>
<br>Eyton spent most of his life on the family estates in Shropshire, and did much to improve the Hereford cattle breed. About 1842 he instituted and conducted the <span class="italic">Herd Book of Hereford Cattle</span>, and continued its publication to 1860 when Mr T. Duckham became its editor.<br>
<br>Eyton took especial pleasure to help fellow students in natural science, as many of his letters show. A friend of Darwin's since Darwin's Cambridge undergraduate years, Eyton went on to help Darwin prepare the descriptions of the birds collected on the <i>Beagle</i> voyage, even though these numbers as part of Darwin's <span class="italic">Zoology</span> were officially credited to John Gould. Though he was a firm opponent of the Darwinian theory, his friendship with its author continued to his death, but he was much chagrined at finding some of his own observations on the habits of pigeons used by Darwin in support of the hypothesis of natural selection. Eyton's interest in natural history was not confined to birds, and in his own yacht and at his own expense, he conducted an investigation for the government into the oyster fisheries of the British islands, the results of which he published in <span class="italic">A History of the Oyster and the Oyster Fisheries</span> (1858), which was illustrated by finely drawn lithographs from his own dissections. Eyton also wrote pieces on &#145;Fishing literature&#146;, &#145;Fox-hunting literature&#146;, &#145;Observations on ozone&#146;, and &#145;Notes on scent&#146; (1870), and made catalogues of the drawings, engravings, and portraits at Eyton Hall.<br>
<br>Eyton was a keen sportsman, and hunted with the Shropshire hounds for several seasons. Throughout his adult life he was an active magistrate; he held a commission in the yeomanry cavalry, and in 1859 was the pioneer of the volunteer movement in Shropshire. Eyton died at the family seat, Eyton Hall, Wellington, Shropshire, on 25 October 1880. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas Slaney Eyton (1843&#150;1899). A daughter, Charlotte Eyton, was author of several works on scientific subjects, including <span class="italic">The Rocks of the Wrekin</span> (1862) and <span class="italic">By Fell and Flood</span> (1872).<br>
