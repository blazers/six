<span class="headword">Spens,  John, of Condie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1573), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of James Spens of Condie, Perthshire. He had a brother, Lawrence, but nothing is known of their mother. A determinant at St Salvator's College, University of St Andrews, in 1535, by 1539 Spens was appearing as an advocate before the lords of session, and a decade later had become one of the nine leading advocates licensed to act in all matters before the college of justice.<br>
<br>From 1554 Spens acted as one of the assessors (or legal advisers) of Edinburgh town council, and between 1558 and 1564 he was regularly either one of the bailies of the burgh or on the council. In October 1555 he was promoted to act as queen's advocate jointly with Henry Lauder, and received a pension in consequence. In 1560 he acted as a spokesman for Mary of Guise in her last negotiations with the lords of the congregation. On 12 November 1561, following Lauder's death, Spens took his place on the bench, <i>ex officio</i> as queen's advocate, and thereafter also attended the privy council. He still held the office of queen's advocate jointly, being now associated in that office with Robert Crichton of Eliok, but after Lauder's death he was the senior figure. In 1566 he was appointed to a commission for the revision of the laws.<br>
<br>Spens married Jane Arnot and they had three daughters, Euphemia, Margaret, and Jean. He also had two natural children, John and Grizel. Spens was described by John Knox as &#145;a man of gentle nature, and one that professed the doctrine of the Evangel&#146;  (Knox, 2.401). In May 1555 he acquired the lands of Condie pursuant to an entail in which it had been stipulated that if his uncle, John Spens of Condie, died without male heirs, then the lands would be disponed to him as the son and heir of James Spens. He therefore inherited the lands at the expense of two female cousins. He also owned lands in Gilmerton, near Edinburgh, where he appears to have lived while working in Edinburgh. On his way home in 1564 he and his servants were attacked by nine men who were later forced to apologize before the lords of council. He referred in his testament to Sir John Wemyss, laird of Wemyss, as his &#145;special gud friend and chief&#146;  (NA Scot., register of testaments). Wemyss was a supporter of Queen Mary in the 1560s. Spens retained his position during all the changes of government from 1560 onwards. His estate, including arrears of pensions, exceeded &pound;4000 at his death. His last will and testament is dated 16 June 1573, and he was dead by the end of the month. His wife, Jane, was his executor, and he also made provision for his natural children.<br>
