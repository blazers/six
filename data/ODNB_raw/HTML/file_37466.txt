<span class="headword">Gooch,  Thomas Longridge</span>  (1808&#150;1882), <span class="occ">civil and railway engineer</span>, was born in London on 1 November 1808, the first son and second of ten children (five sons and five daughters) of John Gooch, cashier of Bedlington ironworks, near Morpeth, Northumberland, and his wife, Anna, daughter of Thomas Longridge, iron-founder, of Newcastle upon Tyne. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10939/', "Daniel Gooch")</script> was locomotive superintendent and later chairman of the Great Western Railway. He was educated nearby at Crow Hall School, by the parson of Horton. In 1823 he commenced an apprenticeship to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26397/', "George Stephenson")</script>, working for two years in the workshops of Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. at Newcastle and then in the drawing office. He also assisted Joseph Locke in taking levels and making plans and drawings for the proposed Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. In 1826, with the passage of the <span class="roman">Liverpool and Manchester Railway Act</span>, he went with George Stephenson to Liverpool, where he prepared most of the working drawings and plans for this railway from Stephenson's rough sketches.<br>
<br>In 1829 Gooch became resident engineer for the uncompleted Bolton and Leigh Railway and in 1830 resident engineer for the Liverpool section of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. George Stephenson then appointed Gooch resident engineer for the proposed Manchester and Leeds Railway, for which he worked almost continuously in preparing plans and drawings for the bill to be presented in the 1831 session of parliament. However, strong opposition resulted in rejection of this bill despite his excellent testimony as an expert witness. Later in the same year he assisted Robert Stephenson in preparing plans and drawings for the <span class="roman">London and Birmingham Railway Bill</span>. After its passage in 1833 he was appointed resident engineer for the northern section of the line.<br>
<br>In 1836 the <span class="roman">Manchester and Leeds Bill</span> was finally passed. In 1837 Gooch was appointed joint principal engineer with George Stephenson, and was responsible for the line's construction, which was his greatest achievement and required many heavy civil-engineering works, including a 2 mile tunnel under the Pennine hills, the boring of which from thirteen shafts took over three years. On the line's completion in 1841, Gooch was made responsible for the construction of branch lines to Heywood, Oldham, Halifax, and Ashton under Lyne. He also prepared plans for the Manchester, Bury, and Rossendale (later East Lancashire) Railway. During the subsequent &#145;railway mania&#146; period he was engaged on proposals for several new lines, including the Stafford to Rugby line through the Trent valley, opened in 1847, for which he was principal engineer, working with Robert Stephenson and G. P. Bidder.<br>
<br>After many years of almost continuous work, broken only by a short honeymoon in 1836, Gooch's health failed and he was taken ill in 1847 at his London office. He was ordered complete rest and convalesced abroad for eight months before resuming work as consultant for the Skipton&#150;Lancaster Railway, at first jointly with Charles Vignoles and then as sole consultant. However, in 1851 his health again gave cause for serious anxiety, and he was compelled to give up full-time activity at the early age of forty-two. He was a sociable man of great ability, but courteous and unassuming, with great kindness and understanding of the problems of others. His later years were devoted largely to charitable work, to which he contributed much in an unostentatious manner. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1845.<br>
<br>In 1836 Gooch married Ruthanna, daughter of Robert Scaife of Liverpool. They had a son, who died aged eleven, and a daughter. Gooch died at Team Lodge, Gateshead, co. Durham, on 23 November 1882. His wife survived him.<br>
