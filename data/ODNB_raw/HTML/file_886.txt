<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aubrey,  John</span>  (1626&#150;1697), <span class="occ">antiquary and biographer</span>, was born on 12 March 1626 at Easton Pierse near Kington St Michael in north Wiltshire, the eldest of the three surviving sons of Richard Aubrey (1603&#150;1652), who owned estates at Burleton in Herefordshire and at Broad Chalke in south Wiltshire, and his wife, Deborah (1610&#150;1686), the daughter and heir of Isaac Lyte (1577&#150;1660) and Israel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browne (1578&#150;1662). The Aubreys were a long-established Welsh family but their fortunes latterly owed much to John Aubrey's great-grandfather William (<i>c</i>.1529&#150;1595), the illustrious Elizabethan lawyer.<h2>
<a name="Wealthtopoverty"></a>Wealth to poverty</h2>A sickly child with a slight stammer, Aubrey grew up mostly at Easton Pierse and after local education, notably under the rector of Leigh Delamere, Robert Latimer, was sent in 1637 or 1638 to board at the grammar school in Blandford St Mary, Dorset. On 3 May 1642 he was entered as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, although his studies were interrupted by the civil war, and on 6 April 1646 he enrolled at the Middle Temple to begin a legal training which he likewise never completed. On his father's death in October 1652 he inherited not only his estates but also his debts, totalling some &pound;1800, which embroiled him in lawsuits for the next fifteen years. Relief was offered by the prospect of marriage to the wealthy Katherine Ryves but was then withdrawn by her death in November 1657, and in 1661&#150;2 he was forced to sell his Herefordshire properties. On 1 November 1665 he became acquainted, &#145;in an ill howre&#146;, with Joan Sumner, and in April 1666 a licence was taken out at Salisbury for their marriage. This never took place, however, and instead there followed five years of recriminations and legal entanglements which dissipated the last of Aubrey's remaining assets. In 1671 he had no choice but to part with the residue of his inheritance and was reduced thereafter to the life of a peripatetic scholar, reliant on the hospitality of various patrons and friends. In some ways he felt the deliverance from his mortgages and litigation an &#145;absconding&#146; and a &#145;happy delitescency&#146;; in other ways he found dependence a blow to his self-respect and sometimes an impediment to his work. The constant &#145;danger of arrests&#146; must have made all the more attractive the prospect of emigration raised by offers of lands in the colonies in 1674 and 1686, but he decided to stay in England. The enforced sale of his books in 1677 indicates that he barely subsisted, and continued poverty helps to account for the money-making ideas which are discussed in his small volume &#145;Faber fortunae&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 26).<h2>
<a name="RoyalSocietycircle"></a>Royal Society circle</h2>Aubrey was never much interested in politics and sympathized with the credo of his friend George Ent: &#145;a pox take parties&#146;. He was a member of the Rota Club founded by James Harrington which met in London at the Turk's Head in New Palace Yard between November 1659 and February 1660, but the focus of his associational life was always more academic than political  (Powell, 92&#150;5, 180). He was elected to the Royal Society on 21 January 1663 and thereafter became an active member, reading a paper on Wiltshire springs on 7 April 1668, a paper on the &#145;cloudy star&#146; in February 1669, and one on winds in February 1673. His <span class="italic">Natural History of Wiltshire</span> was submitted to the society in 1675 and copied in 1691 (RS, MS 92).<br>
<br>Opposed to sects and parties in religion no less than in politics, Aubrey's antiquarian writings often lament the iconoclasm perpetrated by &#145;puritanicall zealotts&#146; during the civil war years. His views on religion were set out in &#145;Hypothesis ethicorum et scala religionis&#146;, or &#145;Religio naturalis&#146;, as he also termed it. Although the manuscript has not survived, it is clear from his other writings that he shared the eirenic, sceptical, and anti-clerical views of many Restoration intellectuals. He was tolerant, rational, and fideistic, favouring a kind of natural theology which held it &#145;a profound part of religion to glorifie God in his workes&#146;  (Hunter, 57). His ethics were very much &#145;doe as you would be done to&#146;, a &#145;little rule&#146; which he thought should be taught to all children as &#145;the basis of right reason and justice, and consequently all other vertues&#146;.<br>
<br>It was this tolerance and humanity that so endeared Aubrey to most of the people with whom he came into contact. He was clearly a man capable of inspiring great regard in others and was, for his part, someone who both valued and needed friendship. Among the wide network of people with whom he shared affection, association, or acquaintance were the fourteen special &#145;amici&#146; listed in his autobiographical notes: Anthony Ettrick, John Lydall, Francis Potter, Sir John Hoskyns, Edmund Wyld, Robert Hooke, Thomas Hobbes, Anthony Wood, Sir William Petty, Sir James Long of Draycot, Charles Seymour, Seth Ward, and William Holder. In 1651 he met Mary Wiseman, &#145;with whom at first sight I was in love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.46); he bequeathed her his best diamond ring and she was perhaps the female companion dearest to him in his life.<br>
<br>The range of Aubrey's intellectual interests and the importance of his contribution to so many fields of study make him difficult to classify. He was one &#145;whose boundlesse mind / Scarce within Learnings compasse is confin'd&#146;, as his friend George Ent put it  (<span class="italic">Three Prose Works</span>, 309). He may with justice be said to be the founding father of three academic disciplines in Britain, being the author of the first English books entirely devoted to archaeology, place names, and folklore. At the same time he pioneered a new kind of fieldwork in the study of natural phenomena and anticipated many of the interests of modern historical scholarship. In his <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, moreover, he penned one of the great literary works of his age. Its intimate and minutely observed biographical sketches of many of the great personalities of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are unrivalled and represent a unique source for much of the personal and anecdotal information which they contain.<h2>
<a name="Antiquarianinterests"></a>Antiquarian interests</h2>Aubrey's interest in antiquities was kindled and nurtured amid the Wiltshire landscape before the civil wars. &#145;I was inclin'd by my genius, from my childhood to the love of antiquities&#146;, he later wrote, &#145;and my fate dropt me in a countrey most suitable for such enquiries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monumenta</span>, 17). He developed a fascination with past ways of life and an obsession to record and conserve as much of it as he could. Such tendencies were already evident when, as an undergraduate in 1643, he employed a hedge-priest named Hesketh to make several drawings of the ruins of Osney Abbey, thus preserving an impression of them before they were destroyed. One was engraved by Wenceslaus Hollar for volume two of Dodsworth's and Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1661).<br>
<br>It was on 6 January 1649, while on a return trip from Oxford to Wiltshire, that Aubrey &#145;discovered&#146; the megalithic monument at Avebury. The posthumous publication of Inigo Jones's book on Stonehenge in 1655 stimulated his further investigations of ancient megaliths, and when Walter Charleton published a rebuttal of Jones's theory in 1663 he recommended Aubrey to Charles II. Aubrey waited on the king during his trip to the west country that year and at his request surveyed Avebury in September &#145;with a plaine-table and afterwards tooke a review of Stoneheng&#146; where he discovered the ring of holes just inside the surrounding ditch which now bears his name. The resulting papers, &#145;Templa druidum&#146; and &#145;Review of Stonehenge&#146;, were completed in 1665 and by 1693 had developed into the &#145;Monumenta Britannica, or, A miscellanie of British antiquities&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MSS top. gen. c.24 and 25). The first part of the work, &#145;Templa druidum&#146;, discusses supposed druid temples, especially Avebury and Stonehenge; part 2, &#145;Chorographia antiquaria&#146;, deals with Roman towns, castles, camps, and other military architecture; part 3 concerns sepulchral monuments, roads and ditches, coins and urns; and part 4 includes &#145;Chronologia architectonica&#146;, an attempt to trace a sequence of architectural styles, written in 1671.<br>
<br>In its descriptions and surveys of ancient sites across Britain, many of which have since disappeared or been significantly altered, the &#145;Monumenta Britannica&#146; remains the foundation text of modern archaeology. Aubrey's suggestion that Avebury and Stonehenge might be druidical represented a major advance on contemporary orthodoxy which usually attributed them either to the Danes or the Romans. Furthermore, his studies of architectural history were almost unique in their day and his attempt to delineate the chronology of evolution in building forms would not be surpassed until the early nineteenth century. Finally, the mass of interspersed comment on the way in which prices, weights and measures, technology, dress, popular customs and beliefs, language, handwriting, and many other features of everyday life had changed over the centuries marks him out as not merely an antiquarian collector of miscellaneous information but an important figure in the development of modern historical scholarship.<br>
<br>Aubrey pursued a similar approach to natural history, with equally precursive results. &#145;My head was alwaies working; never idle, and even travelling (which from 1649 till 1670 was never off my horsback) did gleane som observations, of which I have a collection in folio of 2 quiers of paper + a dust basket, some wherof are to be valued&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.42). From 1656 onwards much of this research was being undertaken for &#145;The naturall historie of Wiltshire&#146; which he seems to have continued until 1691 when a rough draft in two volumes was left in the Ashmolean. In it he made a list of the county's trees and plants with their medicinal and practical uses; he noted its different stones and minerals, clays and soil types with their particular properties; and he catalogued its fauna and medicinal springs, as well as its winds, mists, and storms. The holograph manuscript, now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MSS Aubrey 1&#150;2), incorporates his latest additions and also contains notes by Ray, Evelyn, Tanner, and Gale. Before his death, however, Aubrey removed most of the chapter on air which remains in the earlier version submitted to the Royal Society.<br>
<br>In 1660 it was decided that a work on the antiquities of Wiltshire in the style of Dugdale's <span class="italic">Warwickshire</span> should be written in which Aubrey would undertake the north of the county. Over the next ten years much of his time at home was spent gathering material for his &#145;Essay towards the description of the north division of Wiltshire&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 3). The work was eventually deposited in the Ashmolean under the title &#145;Hypomnemata antiquaria&#146; in two volumes, &#145;liber A&#146; and &#145;liber B&#146;, although the latter is now lost, having being borrowed by Aubrey's brother William in 1703 and never returned. In May 1673, meanwhile, the royal cosmographer, John Ogilby, granted Aubrey a licence to survey the county of Surrey. He undertook his &#145;Perambulation of Surrey&#146; between July and October, although he continued to revise the manuscript until 1692 when he left it unfinished (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 4). The material was rearranged, with both excisions and additions, by Richard Rawlinson and printed with a memoir of Aubrey as <span class="italic">The Natural History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey</span> (5 vols., 1718&#150;19). It was also in this period, between 1670 and 1690, that Aubrey was gathering material for &#145;The interpretation of villare Anglicanum&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 5), the first work entirely devoted to English place names.<br>
<br>Aubrey's fieldwork yielded new findings not only in archaeology and natural history but also in folklore. His seminal &#145;Remaines of gentilisme and Judaisme&#146; (BL, Lansdowne MS 231) contains a mass of gleanings on customs and ceremonies, folk traditions and popular beliefs, old wives' tales and children's rhymes, many of which he considered to be ancient survivals and compared with references in classical authors. He finally wrote up his treatise in three parts between February 1687 and March 1689 and thereafter lent it out to Edward Lhwyd, John Toland, White Kennett, and John Evelyn, the last two of whom added notes to it, as did B. G. Cramer, a German scholar and secretary to the Royal Society. On his death it was in the hands of Kennett and it was to go with the rest of his papers into the Lansdowne manuscripts at the British Museum.<h2>
<a name="Mathematicalsciences"></a>Mathematical sciences</h2>Aubrey played an instrumental part in the scientific movement of the period more broadly. He maintained a keen amateur interest in astronomy, navigation, and applied mathematics and made a significant contribution to the milieu in which new ideas in these and other areas were being debated and disseminated. In the early 1650s he met William Harvey and Samuel Hartlib, with whom he corresponded; he engaged with the ideas of Sir Kenelm Digby and John Wilkins; and he numbered among his closest friends some of the greatest scientists of the age, including Hobbes, Hooke, Pell, Petty, Ward, and Wren. His association with Hartlib and with John Durie helped to form some of the progressive ideas on educational reform which he wrote up in 1669 as &#145;Idea filioli seu educatio pueri&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 10, fols. 162 ff.) and which had developed by 1671 into &#145;An idea of the education of a young gentleman viz from the age of nine or ten years; till seventeen or eighteen&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 10), finally completed in 1684.<br>
<br>Characteristic of his time, Aubrey was fascinated by the supernatural and the occult. In 1674 he copied &#145;Zecorbeni, sive, Claviculae Salmonis libri IV&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 24), a treatise from which to learn magical rites and conjurations, at the end of which he added several pages of other recipes and nostrums. He was no less a typical product of the age in his absorption in astrology. He believed that &#145;we are governed by the planets, as the wheeles and weights move the index of the clock&#146;  (Hunter, 118) and he constructed his <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span> around the individual's horoscope, both figuratively and on the page. He often consulted his friend Henry Coley, one of the foremost astrologers of the day, and he himself cast a collection of figures with brief remarks on their subjects, entitled &#145;Collectio gentiturarum&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 23), bearing the date 1677 although begun rather earlier  (Hunter, 118, plate 9, 118&#150;21, 145&#150;6). His <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, &#145;a collection of hermetick philosophy&#146;, was an investigation into a variety of psychic and supernatural phenomena such as omens and prophecies, dreams and apparitions, day fatality and second sight, all of which he was concerned to explore and explain, verify or discredit. Aubrey's brother William possessed the original manuscript which has not survived but the work was printed in 1696 by the London bookseller Edward Castle and reprinted in 1721, incorporating Aubrey's own additions and corrections.<h2>
<a name="Biographicalworks"></a>Biographical works</h2>On 31 August 1667 Aubrey met Anthony Wood in Oxford, and this was the beginning of an academic collaboration which lasted for the next twenty-five years. Late in 1669 Wood began working on his <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>, biographies of Oxford alumni since 1500. Over the following decade Aubrey acted as Wood's research assistant, regularly supplying him with biographical information by letter, but in so doing he was also compiling the material which was to form the basis of his own &#145;minutes of lives&#146;. The transition to author in his own right may have been precipitated by the death of Hobbes in December 1679 which impelled Aubrey to write his biography, a service which he had promised his great friend as early as 1667. His &#145;Life of Mr Thomas Hobbes of Malmesburie&#146; was to become the fullest of the <span class="italic">Brief Lives</span> but Aubrey chose not to publish it, lending it instead to Richard Blackbourne of Trinity College, Cambridge, who used it to produce his own life of Hobbes in Latin in 1681. In 1680 Wood suggested that Aubrey write a &#145;book of lives&#146; of his own, a project which he set about with such purpose that by 1690 he had sufficient material to contemplate a separate &#145;Lives of our English mathematical writers&#146;. When he finally sent his completed manuscript to the Ashmolean in 1693, it amounted to four folio volumes containing biographies of over 400 luminaries, many of whom Aubrey had known personally or about whom he could impart contemporary gossip (Bodl. Oxf., MSS Aubrey 6&#150;9). In them he wrote with candour and without prejudice, &#145;like Almansar in the play, that spare neither friend nor foe, but a religious John Tell-troth&#146;, infusing them with an intimacy and attention to detail for which he was right to realize future generations would &#145;be gratefull&#146;  (Powell, 182). The &#145;minutes of lives&#146; were first printed, in large part, in 1813 as <span class="italic">Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries</span>.<br>
<br>Among Aubrey's other works were two plays. &#145;I am writing a Comedy for Th[omas] Shadwell which I have now almost finished &hellip;&#146;, he wrote in October 1671, &#145;and I shall fitt him with another the Countrey Revell: both humours untoucht, which I in my tumbling up and downe have collected&#146;  (Hunter, 241). The first of these has not survived and the second, &#145;Countrey Revell, or, The Revell of Aldford, a Comedy by and in the Hand of John Aubrey&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 21), remained a fragmentary attempt at a typical Restoration comedy involving caricatures inspired by his Wiltshire neighbours. He also wrote &#145;Elements of architecture&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1819, item 43), an incomplete broadsheet on the principles of neo-classical architecture which he desired all young men to study. In &#145;Designatio de Easton-Piers in com. Wilts&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 17) he left behind a series of coloured drawings of the house and grounds of Easton Pierse done in 1669 when he knew he was to lose the property. &#145;If ever I had been good for anything&#146;, he wrote with typical self-deprecation, &#145;'twould have been a painter&#146;  (Hunter, 39). A now lost work, &#145;Villa, or, A Description of the Prospects from Easton-Piers&#146;, was evidently a literary companion to the &#145;Designatio&#146;, apparently a short prose eulogy, interspersed with fragments of verse, in praise of his beloved home, written in 1671. He left three manuscript volumes to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, full of arithmetical and algebraic calculations done between the 1650s and 1680s, together with notes and extracts from mathematical treatises (Worcester College, MSS 4.9, 5.4, 5.5). He compiled a sort of scientific commonplace book which he called the &#145;Adversaria physica&#146;, and which by 1692 amounted to a &#145;fol[io] an inch thick&#146;. Although now lost, an idea of its contents in the 1670s can be gained from a transcription of part of it in the hand of Henry Oldenburg preserved in the classified papers of the Royal Society, and also by a copy taken by Thomas Hearne in the late 1720s of some notes from it made by Robert Plot in his &#145;Analecta Ro[berti] Plot&#146; of 1675&#150;6 (Bodl. Oxf., Hearne's diaries, 158&#150;9). &#145;A collection of approved receipts&#146;, of which he makes mention in his <span class="italic">Naturall Historie of Wiltshire</span>, has not survived.<br>
<br>In 1689 Aubrey sent his papers and books to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, where a list of them was drawn up. In November 1692 Edward Lhwyd made a catalogue, &#145;Books written by Mr Aubrey&#146;, totalling twenty-two items (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 5, fol. 123<i>v</i>), and, although much of his library had been sold or given away by this time, at least fifty-one volumes now in the Ashmole series of manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, and sixty-six in the Ashmolean Museum's A&#150;H series, bear Aubrey's signature. His substantive and informative letters to Wood, Tanner, Lhwyd, and others are also preserved in the Bodleian Library (MS Wood F 39; MS Tanner 25; MS Tanner 456a; MS Ashmole 1814; MS Ballard 14), as is a collection of letters written to him from a total of ninety-eight correspondents (MSS Aubrey 12&#150;13).<br>
<br>Aubrey's quick wit and fund of stories must have made him the most convivial of company and in his amusing eccentricities he had something of the archetypal academic about him. Ralph Sheldon once remarked that he was &#145;as mad as anyone almost in the university of Bedlam&#146;  (Powell, 174) and when he met him in the street &#145;talking to himselfe and passing forward without regarding anybody&#146; he thought him &#145;a little crazed&#146;  (ibid., 187). He suffered a fit of apoplexy in January 1694 and it may have been a repeat attack of this which eventually caused his death on a journey from London to Wiltshire. He was buried in the parish church of St Mary Magdalene at Oxford on 7 June 1697.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>It was only in the second half of the twentieth century that the significance of Aubrey's contribution to so many branches of scholarship began to be appreciated. The reasons for the overlooking or undervaluing of his importance are varied. As with so many people of genuine originality, much of what he achieved went unrecognized by contemporaries because unorthodox. Moreover his reputation long suffered as a consequence of the bitter and unfair remarks made about him by Anthony Wood following Wood's prosecution for libelling the first earl of Clarendon in his <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> on the basis of information supplied to him by Aubrey. In addition the range and breadth of Aubrey's work was insufficiently known. Of all his writings only the <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> appeared in print during his lifetime and this gave later generations with no taste for &#145;hermetick philosophy&#146; the occasion to brand him as credulous and superstitious. Edward Lhwyd persuaded him to allow material from the &#145;Monumenta Britannica&#146; to be included in the new edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> being prepared by Edmund Gibson, but Aubrey's attempt to raise subscriptions for the printing of his own volume failed, and on his death the manuscript was left with the London bookseller Awnsham Churchill. There were, however, good reasons why so little of his output got into print. For all his prolific note-taking, minute observation, original insights, and capacity for natural prose, Aubrey often lacked the ability to organize, edit, and shape his materials into the coherent and polished form necessary for publication. He made repeated efforts, especially towards the end of his life when he became worried about the fate of his manuscripts and the future of his reputation, to &#145;methodise&#146; his works, but these met with only partial success.<br>
<br>Few scholarly lives reflect the ferment of ideas in the seventeenth century better than John Aubrey's. His writings epitomize the evolving relationship between older and novel modes of thought which characterized the period, and in the course of his eclectic intellectual explorations he made original and lasting contributions in several fields. Beyond this, in his propensity to record the minutiae of everyday life, he conveys, better than almost any other contemporary, a sense of what it was like to live at the time. Acutely aware of change in the present, no less than in the past, his observations amount to a vivid commentary on the social and cultural impact of the momentous events through which he lived.<br>
