<span class="headword">Lamb,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1686), <span class="occ">linen draper and philanthropist</span>, was for many years confused with a namesake, a soap-boiler by trade: remarkably, both men were prominent General Baptists. The overwhelming evidence that they were not the same individual includes a petition subscribed in 1656 by two London Baptist congregations, each in fellowship with a different Thomas Lamb. The soap-boiler was to stay with the Baptists for the rest of his life, but the linen draper soon abandoned them. This was neither his first nor his last change of judgement about the nature of the church.<br>
<br>We first hear of Lamb in 1641, when he was listed in the poll tax returns for London as a freeman of the Leathersellers' Company, trading at the premises of the liveryman leatherseller Henry Heald of Gracechurch Street. The following year he invested &pound;50 in the Irish Adventurers; later, he was involved in exporting cloths to France and acquired interests in the excise farm. He was a member of the church gathered in the London parish of St Stephen's, Coleman Street, by John Goodwin. For some time, during the civil war, Lamb kept the company of William Walwyn. They sampled the wide range of sermons then available in London and debated the issues which now divided the parliamentarian camp. In matters both of church government and of civil politics the gathered, or &#145;independent&#146;, churches, and not least that of John Goodwin, were exerting great influence in London and aroused the hostility of the presbyterian ministers. But by 1646&#150;7 there had crystallized a Leveller current, whose spokesmen, including and especially Walwyn, attacked the Independents from the left. Thomas Lamb was saddened by his criticism of Goodwin's writings, and the two men became estranged.<br>
<br>Lamb remained in the Coleman Street church and became one of its elders; in 1651 he composed one of the hymns of thanksgiving sung by the congregation after the battle of Worcester. This work is not of the highest poetic quality, but it is still of interest. At once pious, patriotic, and radical, Lamb rejoiced that God had frustrated the designs of the defeated royalist &#145;princes and great men&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>He crusht their rage and cruelty<br>
</div>
<div>The proud which did advance;<br>
</div>
<div>The wicked he hath now brought low,<br>
</div>
<div>And trodden down their place &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Oh ye sons, ye saints of God,<br>
</div>
<div>What say you to this sight,<br>
</div>
<div>Shall not the goodness of your God<br>
</div>
<div>Be greatly your delight?<br>
</div> (Goodwin, <span class="italic">Hymns</span>, 8&#150;10)</blockquote>Lamb formed a lasting friendship with another prominent member of Goodwin's church, the merchant William Allen (who must also be distinguished from a namesake, the adjutant-general). In 1653 Allen, influenced by the former clergyman and future Quaker Samuel Fisher, was converted to the cause of anti-paedobaptism. Thomas Lamb soon followed suit, and after briefly espousing mixed communion the two men led twenty of Goodwin's members out of his congregation. Despite protestations of mutual respect, an unbrotherly exchange of pamphlet-fire followed. Lamb's contribution was <span class="italic">Truth Prevailing Against the Fiercest Opposition</span> (1655), an attack upon Goodwin's <span class="italic">Water Dipping No Firm Footing for Church-Communion</span> (1653); other salvoes were released by Allen, a more dedicated and effective controversialist than his friend, and, for Goodwin, by John Price.<br>
<br>Lamb and Allen had shared in John Goodwin's Arminianism, and this helps explain why it was to the General Baptists that they now attached themselves. More was involved than a shift from one set of church ordinances to another. Goodwin's congregation was wealthy and sophisticated, and its former members seem initially to have sought fellowship with another which might match &#145;such means of Edification as they had left&#146;  (Sylvester, appx 3.51). This, however, could not be found, and a new congregation was gathered in Lothbury. Lamb and Allen were able to attend an intercongregational meeting of General Baptist churches in London, signing as elders its resolution, <span class="italic">The Humble Representation and Vindication</span> (1654). This document noted the religious freedom which the protectorate seemed to promise, and urged local churches not to be drawn into agitation against it. But Lamb's congregation was one of several which protested at the imprisonment in 1655 of John Biddle, whose unorthodox Christological views were attracting some General Baptists.<br>
<br>In 1656 a second intercongregational meeting passed a resolution condemning mixed marriages. Lamb did not sign this, perhaps partly because within the churches of his new faith there were few potential partners whose social position matched that of his unmarried daughters. But principles were also involved. Hostility to mixed marriages was part of a larger trend within General Baptism towards the erection of barriers between the saints and the profane world. Lamb was provoked to a wider questioning of the road he had chosen. He reread works by such men as Richard Baxter and his old pastor John Goodwin, and began to waver once more on the issue of baptism.<br>
<br>By 1658, Thomas Lamb had become deeply concerned about the whole basis of his religious communion. At this point his wife, Barbara, played a vital role&#151;perhaps not for the first time, for John Goodwin charged that &#145;a female head&#146; had engineered the schism of 1653  (J. Goodwin, <span class="italic">Triumveri</span>, 1658, preface, section 4). She certainly initiated the correspondence which led to the prodigal's return. On 12 August 1658 Barbara wrote secretly to Richard Baxter, revealing her husband's inner turmoil. Conversations with the presbyterian Thomas Manton and with the presbyterian and future bishop Edward Reynolds, she reported, had strengthened his growing sense that he had been mistaken in opting for a narrow communion. Lamb could no longer keep silent about his doubts. As a result, the congregation which looked to him for leadership, now 120 strong, &#145;grow offended and disturbed&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.325). Barbara Lamb grasped well the main lines of her husband's difficulties. In choosing Baxter as confidant, she also showed her understanding of the means to resolve them. Concern was growing at this time for a more settled accommodation between the godly of several persuasions. Richard Baxter was a veteran campaigner in this cause. When Lamb wrote to him in September, Baxter simply encouraged him to explore further the logic of his own development. Once more, William Allen seems to have travelled the same road as his friend, and the two may well have exerted reciprocal influence. Both men now found that they had erred in rejecting the operational significance for Christians of the concept of the universal church. Gently encouraged by Baxter, Lamb and Allen now began to canvas among their Baptist friends the merits of open communion with the unbaptized.<br>
<br>In the pursuit of this goal, Lamb's early candour undermined his credit with his church. For a while, his colleague William Allen was listened to with more sympathy, and they succeeded in involving other leading Baptists in discussions. But most members were unalterably opposed to opening their communion, and the larger drive towards accommodation with religious moderates foundered when the end of the protectorate brought to the radicals sweeping, if ephemeral, gains in influence. By January 1659 Lamb had already resumed his attendance at Goodwin's lectures. Acutely aware of the poverty of his congregation, he hesitated to abandon it, and vowed to stay until midsummer. But his authority in Lothbury was already fatally undermined. He was forced to listen to the &#145;Reproaches of my dear friends that pour contempt upon me daily, as a most dreadful Apostate, a Judas&#146;  (T. Lamb to R. Baxter, 15 Jan 1659, Sylvester, appx 3.64). The hostile reception accorded to his ideas probably deepened Lamb's estrangement from his church and its democratic habits, for he became &#145;clog'd with scruples about popular government&#146;  (ibid., 65). Half the congregation now boycotted his services, and steps were taken to subject him to disciplinary proceedings. In April Lamb resigned, and soon repudiated as schismatic not only his second baptism but also religious Independency itself: this, he now thought, was incorrigibly opposed to the universal church. By early July, reported William Allen, Lamb had begun to see as schismatic the Reformation itself; shortly after, he stayed with Baxter at Kidderminster, and it may be that the veteran controversialist was able to help his unstable visitor renew his confidence in the foundations of protestantism. (Baxter, however, explicitly stated that he was not responsible for the abandonment by Lamb and Allen of their belief in believers' baptism.)<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Lamb penned two books against the Independent religion, including <span class="italic">A Fresh Suit Against Independency</span> (1677), which was honest enough to recall his own youthful errors, and which paid tribute to his friend William Allen, now dead. He was probably resident, during these years, at a house, mentioned in his will, at St Bartholomew's Close; it was from St Bartholomew-the-Great that Barbara Lamb had appealed to Baxter. The &#145;Mr Lamb of Bell Alley, Coleman Street&#146; listed in 1677 as a London merchant may very well be our man, since our main source for his later life is Richard Lucas, vicar of Coleman Street. The reference is probably to Lamb's business address. He must certainly have prospered in his trade, for he was elected master of the Leathersellers' Company in 1673&#150;4. Many years before, the impoverishment of his Baptist brethren had troubled Lamb's conscience. Troubling memories and present prosperity may each have sharpened his awareness of poverty. At any rate, philanthropy became his consuming interest: &#145;continually thronged by flocks&#146; of impoverished clients, &#145;several hundred prisoners, were by him, with great travail and expense set free&#146;  (Lucas, 20, 19). So recalled Lucas, who preached the sermon at Lamb's funeral on 23 July 1686, dedicating the published account to his eldest son, John Lamb (1649/50&#150;1708), the vicar of Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire. Barbara Lamb, &#145;an extraordinary intelligent woman&#146; as Richard Baxter remembered her  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.323), had died, probably shortly before her husband.<br>
