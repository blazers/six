<span class="headword">Eustace</span>, count of Boulogne  (<em>c.</em>1129&#150;1153), <span class="occ">claimant to the English throne</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26365/', "King Stephen (c.1092&#150;1154)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18337/', "Matilda of Boulogne (c.1103&#150;1152)")</script>. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46707/', "William (William of Blois), earl of Surrey (c.1135&#150;1159)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54455/', "Mary (Mary of Blois), countess of Boulogne (d. 1182)")</script>. His date of birth has to be surmised from his knighting and advancement to comital rank in late 1146 or early 1147. If he was eighteen at this time he was born in 1129: he may have been a year or two younger, but no more, for he occurs in one of his parents' charters dated not later than 30 August 1131. Eustace was a Boulogne family name, but his father's coup in claiming the English crown in December 1135 moved him onto the wider stage of Anglo-Norman politics.<br>
<br>On this stage, however, Eustace would never enjoy more than a subordinate role. Of the numerous mentions of Eustace in charters and in chronicles, all but a few relate to his position as his father's intended heir. As such, he did homage to the French king for Normandy in 1137. As such, he was betrothed in some state within France to Constance, the sister of Louis VII (<i>r</i>. 1137&#150;80), in February 1140&#151;if the marriage did not take place at the same time, it took place very soon afterwards. As such, in 1141, with his father in captivity after the battle of Lincoln, his still powerful family asked for the release to him of the Boulogne lands and other family estates. This the Empress Matilda and her party refused. Both for the Angevins and the house of Blois it was all or nothing. Henry of Anjou, the son of the empress, claimed to be the lawful heir to England and Normandy: Eustace could claim to be the legitimate heir of an anointed king. In the late 1140s the issue was joined between them. Henry always had the initiative. He came to England in 1149, and was knighted at Carlisle; but Eustace pursued him through the west country, and Henry left England with little achieved. Eustace then followed him to France in 1151, as an ally of his brother-in-law Louis VII; but the French king then accepted Henry's homage as duke of Normandy. In the following year also he was in France, as part of a wider coalition of Henry's enemies; but Henry's control of the duchy remained unshaken.<br>
<br>In diplomatic manoeuvrings ultimately equally fruitless Stephen had attempted to follow Capetian custom, and have Eustace crowned in his own lifetime. His mother assiduously cultivated Archbishop Theobald (<i>d</i>. 1161); but all to no avail. The papacy referred to English custom, and declined to approve Eustace's coronation. His mother died on 3 May 1152, at which point he inherited the Boulogne estates and became count of Boulogne. By the end Eustace alone believed in the legitimacy of his cause. That stage was reached after the second siege of Wallingford in July 1153, after Duke Henry had invaded England and attracted widespread support. Stephen was persuaded to agree to terms, at which Eustace withdrew from the court, &#145;greatly vexed and angry because the war, in his opinion, had reached no proper conclusion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 238&#150;9). Very soon afterwards, on about 17 August 1153, he died in East Anglia. He had wasted the lands of Bury St Edmunds, and that powerful saint was seen by some as implicated in his death; others said more simply that he had died of a broken heart. He died childless, and was buried at Faversham Abbey.<br>
<br>The reputation Eustace left behind was mixed. In the courtly world he was seen as a true son of his father, able to &#145;meet men on a footing of equality or superiority as occasion required&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>, 208&#150;9). In the countryside he was a lord no less demanding than his peers, &#145;a bad man &hellip; he robbed the lands and levied heavy taxes&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, 202). His wife, the Countess Constance, was remembered as &#145;a good woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, 202), but she did not linger in her adopted land, and early in 1154 married Raymond (V), count of Toulouse.<br>
