<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sothern,  Edward Askew</span>  (1826&#150;1881), <span class="occ">actor</span>, born in Liverpool on 1 April 1826, made his mark playing eccentric comic roles on the British and American stage. The son of a collier, he initially studied for a career in medicine, but claimed to have been disgusted by the dissection work at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where he attended operations. In the late 1840s he worked as a clerk in a Liverpool shipping office. However, his personality seemed better suited to the stage, and he soon tried his hand as an amateur at the Theatre Royal, Jersey, in 1848, before moving on to Guernsey, under the stage name of Douglas Stewart. About this time he married Fannie (Frances Emily) Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1882), the daughter of an Irish merchant. The couple had four children&#151;<a href="#cosubject_26041">Lytton Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <a href="#cosubject_65398">Edward Hugh [<i>see below</i>]</a>, George Evelyn Augustus T., and Eva Mary&#151;all of whom appeared on the stage.<br>
<br>Sothern worked in theatres at Portsmouth, Wolverhampton, and Birmingham before heading to Boston, Massachusetts, where he was employed by John Lacy at the National Theatre. He first appeared there as Dr Pangloss in <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>&#151;to miserable reviews. Struggling to establish himself in the United States, he worked at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston and Barnum's Museum in New York. It was in Boston that he met a lifelong friend, the actress Mrs R. H. Vincent. His break finally came when he took on the unlikely role of Armand in <span class="italic">Camille</span> opposite Mathilde Heron at Wallack's in New York. Sothern was tall and slender, with blue eyes and wavy brown hair, but despite his good appearance he was not a natural for romantic roles. According to Clement Scott he was &#145;as handsome a man as ever stood on the stage&#146;; however, Scott continued, &#145;he had not the voice, the touch, the tone or the persuasiveness requisite for a Romeo, a Ruy Blas, or a Lagardi&egrave;re&#146;  (Scott, 1.392). Despite this early success as Armand, Sothern did not make a stage career as a romantic hero, but as a result he was given a part in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span>, staged at Laura Keene's Theatre in New York in October 1858.<br>
<br>Taylor's farce, now best known as the play President Lincoln was watching when he was assassinated in Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC, provided Sothern with the role that would define him as an actor. The play follows the adventures of an American, Asa Trenchard (first played by the American actor Joseph Jefferson), when he goes to England to claim the family estate. Lord Dundreary was not intended to be a major part in the play&#151;Sothern claimed that it was originally a scant forty-seven lines&#151;but Sothern created a notable image of an eccentric, weak-minded fop, featuring an eye-glass, droopy side-whiskers that became known as &#145;Dundrearys&#146;, a lisp, elaborate mannerisms, and verbal nonsense. Lord Dundreary's nonsensical references to the life and wisdom of his &#145;bwother&#146; Sam delighted audiences. The character launched a craze on both sides of the Atlantic (although it completely puzzled the French, who disdained the 1867 Paris production), and the style of walking, dressing, and speaking displayed by Sothern's Dundreary was much imitated and lampooned. In the USA, in particular, Dundreary became the type of the &#145;silly ass Englishman&#146; of title or rank.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span> was given its premi&egrave;re at Laura Keene's Theatre on 15 October 1858 and ran for 150 performances; when the play opened in London, at the Haymarket, in 1861, Sothern played the role of Dundreary 196 times. His appearance in this play was also his London d&eacute;but. The London critics adored his Dundreary: &#145;his embodiment was a veritable creation, well-proportioned, consistent, finished to the nails&#146;  (Towse, 29); &#145;it is certainly the <i>funniest</i> thing in the world &hellip; a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 16 Nov 1861).<br>
<br>In the minds of audiences in the United States and England, Sothern would eternally be associated with Dundreary: &#145;Dundreary was Sothern, and Sothern Dundreary afterward, and the identity could never be destroyed&#146;  (Reignolds-Winslow, 85). The Dundreary craze did not die quickly, and was to have various dramatic resuscitations in such works as John Oxenford's <span class="italic">Brother Sam</span> and H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">Dundreary Married and Done For</span>. But Sothern was ready to move on to new roles. His next major part was the title role in T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">David Garrick</span> (Haymarket, 1864); this was a more sentimental, pathetic character, a break from the rather grotesque caricature of Dundreary. &#145;The critics cut me up root and branch&#146;, said Sothern. But the show was a success anyway. The review in <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that the role &#145;is the first that has really tested Mr Sothern's powers beyond the Dundreary sphere&#146;  (6 May 1864); Sothern's performance in the &#145;drunk scene&#146; of the second act was in fact admired by the critic of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, who praised &#145;the most extravagant form of drunkenness &hellip; perpetually brought into contact with the real agony of mind which is now on the point of casting aside the mask of debauchery&#146;. Sothern would later claim in <span class="italic">The Era</span> to have written some of the best scenes in <span class="italic">David Garrick</span>&#151;and in Robertson's <span class="italic">Home</span>&#151;much to Robertson's disgust. Lester Wallack backed up Sothern in the dispute, but Sothern's contribution to the plays remains unclear.<br>
<br>Sothern's manic energy had social as well as professional outlets; he was well known as a club man, sportsman, and bon vivant, as often in the press for his hunting activities, jokes, magic tricks, and conversation as for his work on stage. F. G. De Fontaine termed him &#145;a Prince of Fellows&#146;. He was also a notorious prankster, as befits someone born on 1 April. In London he was known as part of a lively theatrical circle including J. L. Toole, J. B. Buckstone, T. W. Robertson, and H. J. Byron. The group apparently had an endless taste for low jokes and stunts, such as staging mock disputes on public omnibuses, putting fake advertisements in newspapers, paying street urchins to harass passers-by in the streets, and the like. On one occasion Sothern entered an ironmonger's establishment, accompanied by fellow prankster Mrs Vincent, and persistently demanded a copy of the second edition of Macaulay's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, reducing a clerk to fits. On another occasion Sothern and Toole panicked a waiter by tossing the silver out of a window and hiding under the table; when the waiter, finding the room empty and the silver gone, ran to report the theft, Toole and Sothern restored the settings and resumed their places at table, languidly discussing their meal.<br>
<br>In the 1860s and 1870s Sothern appeared in London and the provinces in such plays as Westland Marston's <span class="italic">A Hero of Romance</span> and T. W. Robertson's <span class="italic">Home</span>; he toured the USA in the mid-1870s. His next great role was as the comically &#145;tragic&#146; actor Fitzaltamont in Byron's <span class="italic">The Crushed Tragedian</span> (1878). Of Fitzaltamont, Sothern said, &#145;I have simply boiled down all the old-school tragedians as I boiled down all the fops I met before I played Dundreary&#146;  (Pemberton, 89). If Sothern was not ultimately suited for tragic roles, he could none the less mock them expertly: <span class="italic">The Era</span> of 19 May 1878 referred admiringly to &#145;the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful &#147;stage walk&#148;, the melodramatic attitudes&#146;. Despite this favourable report, the production was not a success in London, and the Haymarket soon replaced it with another of Byron's plays, <span class="italic">The Hornet's Nest</span>, in which Sothern also appeared. In New York, however, <span class="italic">The Crushed Tragedian</span> was very warmly received. The Philadelphia <span class="italic">Inquirer</span> praised the production:<blockquote>With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it is as though he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself &#145;Ha! ha!&#146; and you know that he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. &hellip; always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous. (Pemberton, 91&#150;2)</blockquote>Despite these successes in other roles, Sothern continued regularly to play Dundreary in <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span> and its offshoots until his death, at his home, 1 Vere Street, Cavendish Square, London, of a lung inflammation on 20 January 1881. He was buried in Southampton cemetery on 25 January. According to his biographer T. Edgar Pemberton, one role he regretted not having played was that of Cheviot in W. S. Gilbert's <span class="italic">Engaged</span> (1877).<br>
<br>Of Sothern's children, Eva had a brief career, as did George (<i>b</i>. 1870)&#151;who was known professionally as Sam Sothern. He was closely associated with his father's roles (as his choice of stage name indicates), although he later had some success in secondary parts in Henry Arthur Jones's <span class="italic">The Case of Rebellious Susan</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">The Liars</span> (1897). <a name="cosubject_26041"></a><span class="headword">Lytton Edward Sothern</span>  (1851&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 27 June 1851, enjoyed his first prominent appearance on the stage in the role of Captain Vernon in a production of <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span> at Drury Lane in 1872; later that year he made a mark in the USA playing the role of Bertie in H. J. Byron's <span class="italic">Home</span> at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. With his dark good looks (Lytton was thought the handsomest of the Sothern men), he was considered a promising comedian. But he worked in his father's shadow and often played roles made famous by the elder Sothern; he took on the parts of Dundreary, Brother Sam, and Garrick during tours of Australia (beginning in 1878) and the United States (in 1883). Of his Dundreary, one critic wrote that &#145;the imitation was exact enough, yet an indescribable &#147;something&#148; was wanting to make the part what it was in the elder Sothern's hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Dramatic Calendar</span>, 27 June 1881). He did, however, show some promise in other comic roles, such as Cecil Leighton in G. R. Sims's <span class="italic">Crutch and Toothpick</span> (Royalty, 1879) and as Arthur Spoonbill in Byron's <span class="italic">Fourteen Days</span> (Criterion, 1882). He died at his home, St James's Chambers, Duke Street, London, on 11 March 1887 of peritonitis, and was buried on 19 March in Brompton cemetery.<br>
<br>It was <a name="cosubject_65398"></a><span class="headword">Edward Hugh Sothern</span>  (1859&#150;1933)<span class="occ"></span>, born in New Orleans on 12 June 1859&#151;his father called him a &#145;handsome little creole&#146;&#151;who made his mark independently of his father. He was educated in England and made his stage d&eacute;but in an American production of <span class="italic">Brother Sam</span> in a minor role; his father, in a letter to Lucy Derby Fuller in October 1879, wrote: &#145;Eddy, my second son, is at the Boston Museum, playing very small parts by my advice. &hellip; I wish him to commence at the bottom of the ladder&#146;  (E. H. Sothern, 32). He was somewhat shorter than his father and rather thin lipped, but dark haired and good-looking. After touring in the USA and England, he was engaged by Daniel Frohman at his Lyceum Theatre in New York, and for the remainder of his career he was associated with the New York theatre, though he toured occasionally in Britain. He began to make his mark in heroic, romantic roles such as that of Prince Rudolph in <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Zenda</span> (1895), but he also showed a flair for romantic comedy, most notably as the lovesick auctioneer in <span class="italic">The Highest Bidder</span> (1887). William Winter remained convinced that &#145;the realm in which he has most naturally, and therefore most freely, moved, is that in which light comedy is commingled with romance&#146;  (W. Winter, <span class="italic">Vagrant Memories</span>, 1915, 432). It was during this period, in 1896, that Sothern met and married his first wife, the actress Virginia Harned (1872&#150;1946).<br>
<br>In the early twentieth century Sothern became a highly popular actor in Shakespearian tragedies, foremost among them <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (1900). It was as a Shakespearian actor that he was associated with the actress Julia Marlowe (1866&#150;1950), and beginning in 1904 the two regularly performed in Shakespeare's plays, including the comedies&#151;critics considered Benedick and Malvolio to be among Sothern's best roles. But some reviewers were unimpressed by his appearances in Shakespeare. Winter lamented &#145;his complete lack of weirdness&#146; in playing Hamlet  (W. Winter, <span class="italic">Shakespeare on the Stage</span>, 1911, 392); J. Ranken Towse asserted that &#145;anxiety over &#147;points&#148; betrayed him occasionally into violence of speech and gesture and painfully abrupt transitions of mood&#146;  (Towse, 393). Sothern and Marlowe were married in 1911 after his first marriage ended in divorce. The two performed in revivals of their favourite plays at the Shubert and Century theatres in 1919 and 1921, but Marlowe's health was failing. During this time Sothern also appeared in early films, including <span class="italic">The Chattel</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">The Man of Mystery</span> (1917). After repeatedly threatening to retire and move to England, he finally did so in 1927. He died of pneumonia in New York on 28 October 1933.<br>
