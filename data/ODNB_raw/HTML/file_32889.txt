<span class="headword">Drayton,  Harold Charles Gilbert <span class="st"> [Harley]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1966), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 19 November 1901 at Streatham, the elder of two sons of Bob Drayton and his wife, Annie Keep. His father, who came from Lincolnshire, was employed by the London county council as a gardener. His mother died when the boys were still very young and they were subsequently brought up mainly in the house of a family called Low, who had recently arrived in Croydon from Dinnet in Aberdeenshire. Alexander Low, a sanitary inspector, had several children and in 1926 Drayton married one of the daughters, Christine Collie.<br>
<br>Soon after leaving school at the age of thirteen Harley Drayton, as he was always known, got a job as office boy in the St Davids group of companies in Dashwood House, Old Broad Street, London. He was hired by J. S. Austen, an able solicitor whom Lord St Davids had enlisted to help run his investment trust companies. Austen spotted the boy's talent, encouraged and befriended him, and indeed subsequently bequeathed to him his estate in Suffolk. Drayton had at that time read little except the <span class="roman">Bible</span> (he later always maintained that <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span> contained all the principles of finance that any businessman needed) and he now turned his attention to reading what was lying around the office&#151;financial newspapers, journals, and company reports. It became apparent that he had an uncanny knack of assimilating and remembering figures, and the encyclopaedic knowledge that he acquired made him indispensable. By 1928 he was manager of the securities agency and it was not long before the economic blizzard swept across the world and his powers were tested. He revealed the courage and tenacity of purpose for which he became known. Lord St Davids died in 1938 and Drayton became <i>de facto</i> head of the group, but the outbreak of war prevented him for some time from exercising his new responsibilities to the full.<br>
<br>The first assignment on which Drayton's reputation began to be built was the management and liquidation of the Lloyd George Political Fund. This entailed close co-operation with certain companies in which there were large shareholdings. His success led to the adoption of a new policy in the St Davids investment trusts of buying into companies in difficulty or in their infancy and helping them with money and advice. Some 20 per cent of the trusts' money was committed in this type of investment, largely unquoted on the stock exchange, and the policy was the subject of criticism by those who thought that investment trusts should not interfere in company management. In fact the technique was so successful that in 1945 a larger-scale operation was launched in the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation. The financial results were most gratifying; Drayton picked his companies well and, without interfering with their managements, was a source of inspiration to them.<br>
<br>During the war Drayton was appointed to the three-man commission sent to Argentina to prepare the ground for the sale of the then British-owned Argentine Railways. The sale was consummated a year or two after the war ended and shareholders got their money and had reason to be satisfied.<br>
<br>In the 1945 general election Drayton stood as Liberal candidate for Bury St Edmunds, where at least he saved his deposit. He took no further active part in politics, but was always ready to give his views in favour of freedom of action and thought. For the next twenty-one years he settled down to heading the group which in 1971, five years after his death, was renamed the Drayton group. He was chairman of the larger trusts in the group. He was elected to the board of British Electric Traction in 1933 and in 1947 he took over the chairmanship, being responsible for two big decisions during his term of office. He successfully resisted the nationalization of the provincial bus companies under the Attlee government and a good many opponents of nationalization were encouraged by his show of independence. Then he took the decision to back independent television; and it needed great courage to see this through. After two years the losses amounted to &pound;6 million, at which point some of the largest participants wanted to withdraw, but typically Drayton bought them out; his faith was justified and the reward was rich.<br>
<br>Drayton had many other business interests. He was chairman of Mitchell Cotts, which led to journeys all over Africa. He was chairman of United Newspapers and was largely responsible for building up the group because of his ability to make acquisitions. He was a director of the Midland Bank and of Eagle Star Insurance. He served his term as chairman of the Association of Investment Trusts and was treasurer of the Institute of Directors on its resuscitation in 1946.<br>
<br>In all these offices Drayton showed his constructive independence and a personal touch. He had originality, conviction, and courage. Smoking his pipe, he would make quick decisions on which he never went back. He was forthright, obstinate, and reliable, like the countryman he always remained. He never received any official recognition of his achievements&#151;perhaps on account of his unwillingness to compromise and conform. Had he been a better public speaker he might have been more widely known.<br>
<br>Drayton's chief interests outside the City were country pursuits which centred around Plumton Hall, Whepstead, near Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk, which J. S. Austen had left to him. He became an enthusiastic farmer, pampered his pigs, loved his garden, and enjoyed entertaining his friends at shooting parties. He was high sheriff of Suffolk in 1957. He collected pictures and books, at first specializing in eighteenth-century pamphlets, then Kiplingiana, and later in fine illustrated books, which also reflected his interest in ornithology. He learned to like the best, and this applied not least to claret, which he dispensed generously.<br>
<br>There were no children of the marriage to Christine Collie Low, which was a very happy one, but he was exceedingly popular with the children of his friends. Indeed, Drayton gave confidence to all with whom he came into contact, and was an active ally and friend. He died on 7 April 1966 at his London house, 20 Kensington Palace Gardens; Princess Alexandra was present at his funeral at St Petronella, Whepstead, near Bury St Edmunds, on 14 April, and an enormous concourse attended his memorial service in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
