<span class="headword">Cornwallis,  James</span>, fourth Earl Cornwallis  (1743&#150;1824), <span class="occ">bishop of Lichfield and Coventry</span>, was the third son of Charles Cornwallis, first Earl Cornwallis (1700&#150;1762), and his wife, Elizabeth Townshend (<i>d</i>. 1785), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Charles Townshend, second Viscount Townshend of Raynham")</script>, and was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6338/', "Charles Cornwallis, first Marquess Cornwallis (1738&#150;1805)")</script> and elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6346/', "William Cornwallis (1744&#150;1819)")</script>. He was born in Dover Street, Piccadilly, London, on 25 February 1743, and was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in June 1763, before being given a fellowship at Merton, from which college he took the MA degree in 1766. On leaving Oxford he entered as a member of the Temple, and intended practising at the bar, but on the advice of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6340/', "Frederick Cornwallis (1713&#150;1783)")</script>, archbishop of Canterbury, he changed his mind and was ordained.<br>
<br>Cornwallis commenced his career in the church by acting as chaplain to his cousin Lord Townshend, lord lieutenant of Ireland, until in 1769 he was presented by his uncle to the living of Ickham, Kent, to which that of the neighbouring parish of Adisham was added the following year. In this same year (1770) he was made a prebendary of Westminster, rector of Newington, Oxford, and then of Wrotham, Kent. On receiving this last appointment he resigned the livings of Ickham and Adisham, but six months later he was for the second time inducted as rector of Ickham, a dispensation having been granted which allowed him to hold the rectory of Wrotham conjointly with that of Ickham and the chapel of Staple. In 1771 he married Catherine (1742&#150;1811), daughter of Galfridus Mann (1706&#150;1756) of Newton and Boughton Malherbe, and younger sister of the politician Sir Horatio Mann. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, two children&#151;Charles and Susan&#151;who died in infancy, and a son, James.<br>
<br>In 1773, having in the meantime again resigned the living at Ickham, Cornwallis became, still by his uncle's patronage, rector of Boughton Malherbe in the same county. From being a prebendary of Westminster he was preferred in 1775 to the deanery of Canterbury, while he continued to hold his parochial cures, and at about the same time he received the honorary degree of DCL from his university. In 1781 he was consecrated bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, and then at length retired from his Kentish livings. On the translation of Bishop Douglas of Carlisle to the see of Salisbury in 1791, Cornwallis succeeded him as dean of Windsor, a position which three years later he exchanged for that of dean of Durham.<br>
<br>The bishops of Lichfield lived at Eccleshall Castle rather than the more modest palace in the close. Although the house at Eccleshall adjoined the churchyard, Cornwallis insisted on driving through the town in his four-horse carriage to the church gates, and no one left the church before him after services. A turnpike was set up near his gate, whereupon he moved to Richmond, Surrey: from thence he made a visitation every three years. This resulted in more than 1200 confirmations at one time in Stafford and 700 in Tamworth. It is said that Cornwallis's example encouraged widespread pluralism in the diocese. He wrote a subservient letter to Pitt in 1791 asking for the deanery of St Paul's but received a crushing reply. Between 1777 and 1811 he published five of his sermons.<br>
<br>Following the death of his brother-in-law, Sir Horatio Mann, in April 1814 Cornwallis inherited the Mann family's property. In August 1823 the second Marquess (and third Earl) Cornwallis died; the marquessate became extinct, but the earldom reverted to James Cornwallis. The bishop was by now in his eighty-second year, and on 20 January 1824 he died at Richmond. He had been bishop of Lichfield for nearly forty-three years, and was buried in his cathedral. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, his funeral cort&egrave;ge was splendid, going from Richmond to St Albans where it stayed one night and proceeding to Lichfield on the following day. Cornwallis's memorial tablet in Lichfield Cathedral states merely that he was &#145;Highly respected throughout his diocese&#146;.<br>
