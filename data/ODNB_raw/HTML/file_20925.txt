<span class="headword">Oswell,  (William) Cotton</span>  (1818&#150;1893), <span class="occ">explorer and hunter</span>, was born at Leytonstone, Essex, on 27 April 1818, the elder son of William Oswell (1782&#150;1822) and his wife, Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1848), the daughter of Joseph Cotton, deputy master of Trinity House and grandson of Dr Nathaniel Cotton. From 1833 to 1835 he was at Rugby School, under the headmastership of Thomas Arnold. He proceeded to East India College, Haileybury, where he was placed second among the students of his year. Having obtained an appointment through his uncle John Cotton, one of the East India Company's directors, in 1837 he went to Madras where, during his ten years' residence, he won celebrity as an elephant-catcher.<br>
<br>After serving as assistant to the principal collector of revenue at Arcot and as head assistant at Coimbatore, Oswell was ordered to South Africa for his health. There he spent two years in hunting and became acquainted with the missionary David Livingstone. When in 1849 Livingstone determined to investigate the truth of rumours as to a great lake in the Kalahari, Oswell and his friend Mungo Murray returned to South Africa from England in order to take part in the exploration, Oswell undertaking to defray the whole expense of the guides. The result was the discovery by Europeans of Lake Ngami, and the important practical demonstration that the Kalahari could be crossed by oxen and wagons. Livingstone freely acknowledged his indebtedness to the companionship of Oswell, who looked after the wagons and supplied the party with food, thus enabling the work of surveying, of making scientific collections, and of studying the African people to be carried on without anxiety or preoccupation. The kuabaoba, or straight-horned rhinoceros, was named Oswellii after Oswell, who also received the medal of the Societ&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie de Paris for his share in the journey. He again accompanied Livingstone in 1851, on an expedition to meet the Kololo paramount chief Sebituane. On that occasion they first sighted the Zambezi River.<br>
<br>Recalled from a life of adventure by family matters, Oswell returned to England in 1853. On the outbreak of the Crimean War he went to the front as the guest of some of his Indian friends, and rendered good service in the trenches, in the hospitals, and as the bearer of secret service money for Lord Raglan. He afterwards travelled through North and South America, and in 1860 married Agnes Frances (<i>d</i>. 1908), fourth daughter of Francis Rivaz; they settled at Groombridge in Kent. In his lifetime he was more celebrated as a gentleman sportsman than as an African explorer. His collection of hunting trophies was renowned as a private museum and, at the end of his life, he contributed chapters to C. P. Wolley's anthology <span class="italic">Big Game Shooting</span> (1894). To the regret of his contemporaries, Oswell published no accounts of his expeditions with Livingstone. His modesty, gentlemanly demeanour, and physical prowess were much admired. He died at his home, Hillside, Groombridge, on 1 May 1893, survived by his wife, three sons, and two daughters, and was buried at Groombridge.<br>
<br>After his death, much of his most important correspondence was published by his eldest son, Edward Oswell, together with a foreword by his friend Francis Galton, the propagandist of eugenics. Among these letters are some from Livingstone which credit Oswell with the initial conception of introducing European colonization and commerce to central Africa as an antidote to the slave trade.<br>
