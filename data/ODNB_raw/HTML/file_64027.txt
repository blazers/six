<span class="headword">Robinson,  Christopher</span>  (1712&#150;1787), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Dublin, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23831/', "Dr Bryan Robinson (1680&#150;1754)")</script>, physician and medical writer, who became regius professor of physic at Trinity College, Dublin. His mother, whose name is not known, died on 25 February 1744. Robinson received private tuition before entering Trinity College in 1729 at the age of sixteen. He was later admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn and in 1737 was called to the Irish bar.<br>
<br>Robinson's competence, attention to detail, and familiarity with past precedents procured his rise within the ranks of the Irish legal profession. He never entered parliament but rendered government useful alternative service as a pamphleteer. As seneschal of the Dublin liberty of St Sepulchre's from 1742, Robinson was embroiled in quarrels over his court's powers, in the course of which, unusually for an Irish lawyer of the period, he acquired a taste for historical research. Made a king's counsel in 1744, Robinson regularly served as a judge of assize and on the Dublin city commission before his elevation, on the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Bowes, to a puisne judgeship in the court of king's bench in 1758. Later the same year at Cashel, in co. Tipperary, he married Elizabeth Martin (<i>d</i>. 1793), only daughter of the Revd Hartstonge Martin of Kilkenny; they had three sons, only one of whom survived his father.<br>
<br>Robinson's twenty-nine years on the bench constituted one of the longest eighteenth-century Irish judicial careers. He did not court popularity. A stout defender of the penal laws against Catholics, he was later to manifest hostility to proposals for Irish legislative independence. In 1763 he backed the preferment of charges of treason against the Oakboys of co. Armagh, insisting that the offence was broad enough to encompass the conduct of those who sought by armed force to demolish enclosures, raise wages, or break open prisons. Robinson at the same time extended no favours to those in high places. In 1769, during a sitting of the Irish parliament, he imposed fines on eight MPs who had failed to appear for jury service. The next year he placed a hefty mulct on the property owners of co. Armagh for failing to keep the circuit road from Armagh to Lisburn, co. Antrim, in a decent state of repair. Motions censuring Robinson for his actions on both occasions were adopted by the Irish House of Commons within days of each other in March 1772. Nor did Robinson endear himself to John Blaquiere, the Irish chief secretary, in the 1774 controversy over the latter's enclosure of land in the Phoenix Park to build himself an official residence: he dissented from his colleagues in king's bench who voted to quash the presentment charging public nuisance. Robinson's tenure of office preceded regular Irish law reports. Exceptionally, a printed judgment of his from 1784, that in <i>R. v. Reily</i>  (<span class="italic">Irish Term Reports</span>, 204, at 227), survives. Agreeing with the rest of the court that a sheriff, in summoning a meeting to press for parliamentary reform, had violated his constitutional office, Robinson lamented that the people were so commonly led astray &#145;by the idle declamatory frothy compositions of half-educated young men&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Robinson's opinions on a range of issues were frequently deferred to by his fellow judges. Some of the working papers from which these oracular pronouncements derive are extant, all unpublished (Pearse Street Public Library, Dublin). In these particular interest attaches to Robinson's coverage of contemporary case law, English and Irish. He left important notes, too, on such subjects as the doctrinal relationship of murder and manslaughter, the <span class="roman">Irish Civil Bill</span>, and the crown's Irish revenue. Robinson amassed a library of over 4000 books, one of the largest in private ownership in Ireland at the time. A substantial part of the collection was acquired after his death by the benchers of King's Inns in Dublin to form the nucleus of the library at the inns which was opened in the early nineteenth century. Robinson died at his home, 8 Dominick Street, in Dublin, on 16 January 1787.<br>
