<span class="headword">Rayner,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1699, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, the son of Christopher Rayner, mariner, and his wife, Anne, was baptized at the church of St Giles Cripplegate on 4 October 1699. In 1714 he was apprenticed to the City printer Anne Motte and in 1719 he was turned over to John Millet, a printer whose output consisted mainly of ballads, broadsides, and chapbooks. Rayner was later said to have married before completing the final two years of his term and he certainly did not become free of the Stationers' Company until 1737. However, unless he married outside London, the registers do not seem to corroborate the suggested timing. In 1724 a William Rayner married an Elizabeth Bray at St Martin-in-the-Fields and the elusive E. Rayner, the wife of William who worked in his shops and appeared on an increasing number of imprints identified only by an initial, was perhaps this Elizabeth. The careers of William Rayner and a fellow printer/publisher, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64282/', "Robert Walker")</script>, followed a very similar trajectory and there were probably some ill-defined commercial links between them during the 1720s and 1730s as they came to dominate areas of the trade in cheap print. Both Rayner and Walker set up as pamphlet sellers and in 1728 they appeared jointly on the imprint of a virulent anti-Walpole pamphlet. <span class="italic">The Dunghill and the Oak</span> was printed for Walker and &#145;W. R.&#146; and the publication of this form of occasional political material became characteristic of the initial phase of Rayner's and Walker's careers in publishing. At the end of 1729 both were independently implicated in the publication of pamphlets which hinted at Jacobite sympathies, although neither was prosecuted. By the early 1730s Rayner was running the New Pamphlet Shop next door to the George Tavern at Charing Cross, with the help of his wife and a female servant. The publications issued from this address were numerous and varied, but while E. Rayner appeared mainly on the imprint of light, non-controversial material, William Rayner himself moved into areas of commercial and political conflict. He was soon identified in print as a &#145;notorious Paper Pyrate&#146;, freely publishing versions of other people's work, including Henry Fielding, while he continued to cash in on the popularity of attacks on the government. Like Walker, Rayner contracted out at least part of his printing to other members of the trade, but by 1733 he had his own office in Marigold Court near the Exeter Exchange in the Strand. The link between the two publishers was given a concrete form in 1731 when Rayner's name appeared on an affidavit, printed in the <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, supporting Walker in his disclaimer of responsibility for the content of a libellous pamphlet.<br>
<br>The next phase in Rayner's erratic career was precipitated by a political prosecution. In 1731 a collection of leading essays published in <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, the main vehicle for opposition attacks on Walpole's government, was published in seven volumes. Each volume had an allegorical frontispiece and the popularity of the material provided Rayner with an opportunity to combine his piratical and political interests by reprinting the frontispieces on a single sheet under the title <span class="italic">Robin's Reign, or, Seven's the Main</span>. The official response to this was slow but it may have been the reprinting of the broadside under a modified title, combined with the presentment of this and related material by the Middlesex grand jury, that triggered the legal action. Robert Walker was among those arrested but the weight of the proceedings fell on Rayner. After a period on the run he was arrested, imprisoned, and brought to trial in 1733. His defence hinged on some implausible technicalities and was accompanied by a plea of poverty. If his debts were taken into account, it was claimed, and his wearing apparel excluded, he would not to be worth &pound;5. The sentence took some account of this. He was fined &pound;50 rather than the usual &pound;100, sentenced to two years in prison, and ordered to find security for his good behaviour for seven years.<br>
<br>By September 1733 Rayner was in the king's bench prison in Southwark. Like the Fleet prison on the north bank of the Thames, the king's bench was surrounded by a network of streets and alleys in which the prisoners, mainly debtors, could obtain the right to work at their respective trades. On obtaining the &#145;Rules&#146;, Rayner's activities as a publisher continued unabated and he moved rapidly into new areas of cheap print centred on newspapers and the serial publication of works in parts. Among the first of his hybrid serials was <span class="italic">The Compleat Historian, or, The Oxford Penny-Post</span>, advertised in September 1733. It was sold &#145;for the Benefit of William Rayner, Prisoner in the King's Bench&#146; and was printed at his office in Marygold Court. The characteristically mixed content printed on three folio sheets and selling at 2<i>d</i>. included a combination of news, state trials, and a history of Scotland. It was to be published every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. By September 1734 Rayner had opened a printing office in Bird Cage Alley in Southwark, next door to the Horse and Groom alehouse, where he employed, among others, the politically compromised compositor Doctor Gaylard.<br>
<br>Rayner's output, like that of Walker with which it overlaps, has a variety of confusing features compounded by deliberate attempts to conceal or mislead. The volume of material he produced was considerable and his premises seem to have become the focus for a network of book-trade outsiders, printers, engravers, and authors who provided the workforce on which his activities were based. Walker moved progressively away from the London market; Rayner, partly by force of circumstances, focused on the metropolis. In 1734 he was distantly involved in the Shakespeare piracies which preoccupied Robert Walker but while the volume of his cheap, serial output was increasing and his conflicts with members of the respectable London trade continued unabated, the scale of his business and the state of his personal circumstances remain hard to identify. In 1735 he was negotiating with Robert Bloomfield in Norfolk over the sale of a second-hand press, while the following year the bizarre plot to explode a parcel of leaflets in parliament was hatched in his immediate neighbourhood by the nonjuror Robert Nixon. This was more Gaylard's business but at the time he was still working for Rayner.<br>
<br>The stages by which William Rayner moved out of the king's bench and the causes of his long-term residence within the rules are equally obscure. In 1737 he became free of the Stationers' Company but remained within the prison. It may have provided a convenient base for his aggressive excursions into the market for print. In 1738, taking advantage of the split in the management of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, which remained in print, Rayner began to orchestrate the publication of the <span class="italic">Original Craftsman</span> in head-on competition. Production was organized in association with the printer John Standen, who moved to the Old Bailey to facilitate publication. Rayner hired two of the floating population of hackney writers, Dennis de Coetlogan and Norton Defoe, to provide regular copy and seems to have monitored the printing though his name was entirely absent from the paper itself. His real position only emerged when official action was taken against the paper and Standen, Gaylard, and both authors were arrested and subjected to close examination. Whatever the outcome, Rayner, in the security of the king's bench, seems to have remained untouched. In May 1739 he set about disposing of a large quantity of stock consisting mainly of part works and copperplate-engravings. His position outside the charmed circles of the respectable trade probably forced him to deal directly with the public through the unusual device of a subscription sale, for which he issued 8000 tickets at 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. each. In July he obtained his freedom of the City of London and the following year moved from Southwark to a new printing office in Wine Office Court in the ward of Farringdon Without. As usual, his personal circumstances are obscure. In a petition for release at the beginning of 1740 he claimed to be utterly unable to pay the money required from his original sentence.<br>
<br>This marked the beginning of the third phase in Rayner's career in the print trade. His output was still based on newspapers and part works although the controversial elements of his business were apparently in decline. His successful tri-weekly paper which had first appeared in 1736 as <span class="italic">Rayner's Morning Advertiser</span> continued in print under a variety of modified titles into 1743, while the annotated versions of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> which had provided one of his staples during the 1730s also remained an element in his output during the next decade. The indications are that Rayner was becoming respectable. In 1744 he took over two apprentices from John Standen and so became directly associated with the Stationers' Company whose members' interests he had been attempting to undermine for years. Walker remained combative and unassimilated by the respectable trade. Rayner may have joined it. The reason seems to lie partly in the change to his personal circumstances caused by a fortunate second marriage. In 1741 Sir John Dineley-Goodere was murdered by crewmen who had been hired by his brother. Meanwhile, in the mid-1730s, Sir John's wife, Mary, had been imprisoned in the king's bench where she may have met Rayner. In 1743, according to John Nichols, they married and Rayner acquired the murdered husband's property, including the manor of Charlton in Worcestershire. Support for this account appeared in Rayner's will of 1761, where he described himself as formerly of Charlton in the county of Worcester. In May 1744 he was granted a licence under letters patent to the sole right to print and publish <span class="italic">A Family Bible, or, The Old and New Testament Explained by Way of Question and Answer</span> by William Friend, but already his direct engagement with the book trade was fading. For the rest of his life he held shares in various copies but there are no indications that he was subsequently involved in either the production or distribution of print. There is also some suggestion that he may have had a continuing interest in medicines. During the late 1730s, in tandem with Walker in Fleet Lane, he sold Daffy's Elixir and other medical specifics from his warehouse in Southwark. Under the terms of his will, George West, apothecary of Derby Street, Westminster, was appointed executor to oversee the sale of his property, while in the single year 1760 an entry in the land tax assessment for Fleet Lane identified a William Rayner. It seems possible that even at this late stage a link existed with Dr Walker as he now called himself. Some time in the mid-1740s Rayner may have moved to Charlton, though Nichols claimed that he alienated the property soon after he had acquired it. By the time he came to make his will in 1761 he was living on a copyhold estate in the prosperous London suburb of Hammersmith.<br>
<br>In his brief published comments, John Nichols implicated Rayner in a piece of sharp practice that may have occurred shortly before his death. The City printer Elizabeth Nunneley was said to have bequeathed a substantial property to her nephew and niece &#145;of which they were deprived by the chicanery of &hellip; their guardian&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.447) identified by Nichols as the printer William Rayner. The date of Mrs Nunneley's death cannot have occurred much before 1760 and it was only in a correction to an earlier statement that Rayner's name was substituted for Baynes. However, Nichols identified Mrs Nunneley as publisher of the <span class="italic">St. James's Evening Post</span> and in 1761 Rayner held a 1/20 share in this paper as well as in its partner publication, <span class="italic">Read's Weekly Journal and London Spy</span>. Direct evidence is lacking, but it was the sort of action that a self-interested businessman of Rayner's type might have been ready to undertake.<br>
<br>Under Rayner's will, drawn up on 21 May 1761, he bequeathed his property to his third wife, Anne, of whom further details are unknown. There was no mention of children by this or any other marriage. His financial position appears to have been stable and the valuation of his stock made at the beginning of 1761 indicated his ownership of some useful properties. <span class="italic">Smith's Bible</span>, which Rayner had first issued in parts during the 1730s, was valued at &pound;350. This, in combination with his interest in the Hammersmith estate and other accumulated assets, may have justified the use of the respectable title of esquire in the probate record. Rayner died not long after making his will, which was proved on 6 November 1761.<br>
