<span class="headword">Stephens,  George</span>  (1813&#150;1895), <span class="occ">philologist and runologist</span>, son of John Stephens (1772&#150;1841) of Ongar, a Methodist minister, and his wife, Rebecca Eliza Rayner (<i>d</i>. 1852), was born at Liverpool on 13 December 1813. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26389/', "Joseph Rayner Stephens (1805&#150;1879)")</script>. George was educated at private schools and at University College, London, where he was one of the earliest students. In 1834 he married Maria (1808&#150;1896), daughter of Edward and Elizabeth Bennett of Brentwood, and in the same year he took up residence in Stockholm, where his brother had settled in 1826, and where he found employment as a teacher of English. His earliest publications reflect his own pedagogical interests and needs: <span class="italic">An Outline Sketch of Shakspere's &#145;Tempest,&#146; with Remarks</span> (1836); <span class="italic">Conversational Outlines of English Grammar</span> (1837); an edition of Washington Irving's <span class="italic">Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of Columbus</span> (1837), intended as a reading book for Swedish students of English; and an English&#150;Swedish dictionary (1841).<br>
<br>It was his brother Joseph who first directed Stephens's attention to Scandinavian languages and literature. In 1839 he published an English verse translation of Esaias Tegn&eacute;r's popular <span class="italic">Frithiofs saga</span>, together with a translation of the medieval Icelandic saga on which the poem was based. This was the first English translation of a complete Icelandic saga ever published. He was a founding member of the Svenska Fornskrifts&auml;llskapet (Society for the Publication of Ancient Swedish Texts), established in 1843, for which he was to edit from manuscripts several important works of early Swedish literature. In 1844 he was associated with G. O. Hylten-Cavallius in the publication of a collection of Swedish popular tales, and he initiated a pioneering scheme for the investigation of popular antiquities in Iceland which was adopted by the Northern Antiquarian Society in Copenhagen in 1845.<br>
<br>Stephens's translation of a newly discovered Old English poem, &#145;The Phoenix&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> in 1844, was written in what seemed to many a highly idiosyncratic style, retaining the alliteration of the original verse, and wherever possible using Anglicized forms of old-northern rather than Graeco-Roman and French vocabulary. Thereafter Stephens's publications tended to favour &#145;forewords&#146; rather than &#145;prefaces&#146;, &#145;betterings&#146; rather than &#145;corrections&#146;, and a &#145;wordhoard&#146; rather than a &#145;vocabulary&#146;. His own often thunderous prose style is reminiscent of Wulfstan's sermons. His linguistic and stylistic preferences, desire to reform the English spelling system, and choice of texts for editing, were driven by a distinctive politicized philology. He was throughout his life implacably hostile towards what he regarded as German military and philological imperialism. He refused to use the German-derived (as he regarded it) term &#145;Anglo-Saxon&#146;, preferring &#145;Old English&#146;. He believed that the language and literature of pre-conquest England were essentially &#145;old-northern&#146; or &#145;Scando-Anglic&#146; in origin, rather than Teutonic. Elementary grammar appeared to contradict him, however: whereas the Old Icelandic language featured infinitives ending in -a, middle-voice verbs, and suffixed definite articles, Old English had neither of these latter two elements, and -an infinitives. Stephens claimed that such apparent differences were misleading, arguing that both Old English and Old Icelandic were the late clerkly &#145;book-tungs&#146; of ninth-century Wessex and thirteenth-century Iceland, subsequently fossilized in Victorian grammar books. In earlier centuries, he maintained, the &#145;Scando-Anglic folk-tung&#146; introduced to Mercia and Northumbria by the first wave of Scandinavian invaders and settlers after <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 200 had shared common grammatical features with all other &#145;Scando-Gothic&#146; dialects, before Old Icelandic and Old English developed their local variations. It was this &#145;Scando-Gothic&#146; language which survived in the early British and Scandinavian runic inscriptions which he collected and published. Stephens claimed that, just as the limitations of the Roman alphabet had muted the sonic richness of old-northern English, so the traditions and &#145;iron laws&#146; of nineteenth-century Teutonic philology were in danger of obscuring Britain's old-northern heritage. His later residence as an Englishman in Denmark led him to identify residual old-northern continuities between rural language in the two countries. Unlike their urban contemporaries, the unlettered farm labourers of northern England and Jutland could (he claimed) communicate effortlessly with each other in their cognate dialects. Driven by these philological principles and prejudices, it was natural for Stephens to be appalled by the 1864 German annexation of Schleswig-Holstein, the modern Danish homeland of England's early old-northern settlers; he felt that it severed by force of arms the cultural links which his philological research had re-established.<br>
<br>Stephens's residence in Denmark had begun in 1851, when he was appointed lector in English language and literature at the University of Copenhagen, or Cheapinghaven, as his philological sensitivities led him to name it. In the following year he was appointed lector in Old English. A collection of the historical and legendary ballads of Sweden, prepared by him in collaboration with G. O. Hylten-Cavallius, appeared in 1853. In 1855, having previously become a Danish subject, he was appointed professor at the university. During the next few years he published many works promoting his old-northern philological sympathies. Among them was a five-act chamber drama, <span class="italic">Revenge, or, Woman's Love</span> (1857), set in ancient Mercia and Sweden; in 1860 he published for the first time a fragment of the Old English poem &#145;Waldhere&#146;, discovered by Professor E. C. Werlauff in the university library; and the same year saw the publication of Stephens's edition of <span class="italic">Sir Amadace: a Middle-Northern-English Metrical Romance from the Thirteenth Century</span>.<br>
<br>In 1866 there appeared the first volume of the work on which Stephens's modern reputation is principally based, <span class="italic">The old-northern runic monuments of Scandinavia and England, now first collected and deciphered</span>. Later volumes appeared in 1868, 1884, and (edited by S. O. M. Soderberg) in 1901. An abridgement of the first three volumes was published in 1884. The energy which Stephens devoted to securing accurate copies of the inscriptions is remarkable, and as a storehouse of materials for runic studies the volumes remain invaluable. For over a hundred years it represented the only attempt to produce anything approaching a full corpus of English runes: some of the items were published for the first time in the volumes, and Stephens remains a primary authority for a number of provenances. His own contributions to the interpretation of the inscriptions are unreliable, however. His philological preconceptions and misguided enthusiasms led him into frequent error, most spectacularly when deciphering the inscription found at Brough in Northumbria, which he translated in the belief that it was written in Anglian runes; he later acknowledged that the inscription was written in Greek hexameters.<br>
<br>The sheer volume of Stephens's published work is formidable: the bibliography in T. H. Erslev's <span class="italic">Forfatter-Lexicon</span>, which extends only up to 1868, fills ten closely printed pages. He was an indefatigable contributor to many periodicals, both Scandinavian and English, including the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Many of his articles deal with questions of political and philological controversy. He proved to be an opponent of hereditary aristocracy as well as of popular revolution. He added a large number of quotations, principally from the literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to the materials assembled for what eventually became the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Stephens was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a member of many learned societies in Scandinavia and Britain. He was awarded a PhD by the University of Uppsala and an LLD by the University of Cambridge. He was a knight of the orders of the northern star, St Olaf, and the Dannebrog. He resigned his professorship in 1893, and died in Copenhagen on 9 August 1895.<br>
