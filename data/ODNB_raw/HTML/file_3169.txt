</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bradbury,  Thomas</span>  (1676/7&#150;1759), <span class="occ">Independent minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Alverthorpe, near Wakefield, where his father, Peter Bradbury (1639/40&#150;1699), a tailor, was a leading member of a dissenting meeting; his mother was Mary (<i>d</i>. 1723). Peter Nayler, the minister at Alverthorpe, had been ejected from West Houghton in Lancashire in 1662, and it was he who began the young Bradbury's education, noting his unusually retentive memory. After attending the free school at Leeds, Bradbury entered Timothy Jollie's dissenting academy at Attercliffe. Oliver Heywood records in his diary meeting the student Bradbury and giving him books. The two later corresponded. A particular influence on Bradbury was Thomas Whitaker, minister of Call Lane, Leeds, a man of orthodox views who befriended him and took him into his home. Bradbury visited Whitaker regularly until his death in 1710 and then edited a collection of his sermons.<br>
<br>Bradbury's ministry began in 1697 when he supplied the vacant pulpit at Beverley. While there, he corresponded with George Keith, the self-styled Christian Quaker, and received copies of Keith's narratives of the proceedings at Turners' Hall. In 1699 he became assistant minister at Newcastle upon Tyne, first to the elderly Dr Richard Gilpin, then to his successor, Benjamin Bennet. His popularity with the congregation led to a disagreement with Bennet, and in September 1701 he received, but did not pursue, an invitation to the church in Mark Lane in London, which then called Isaac Watts.<br>
<br>Bradbury's first publication, <span class="italic">Christus in coelo</span>, was a selection of his Newcastle sermons. It appeared in 1703, and the following year Bradbury became assistant to John Galpin, minister at Stepney. Almost immediately he was invited to Yarmouth as co-minister with Samuel Wright but rejected the call. A letter to Bradbury in April 1704 from Jeremiah White, Oliver Cromwell's former chaplain, suggests that a faction of the congregation at Newcastle may have invited him to return. He remained at Stepney, however, until his public ordination as minister of the former Moravian meeting-house in Fetter Lane, London, on 10 July 1707, where he succeeded Benoni Rowe. Bradbury's <span class="italic">Confession of Faith</span> shows him to have been a firm Calvinist. Its publication ran to five editions by 1729.<br>
<br>Lively minded, with an easy way of public speaking, a good presence, and an arresting turn of phrase, Bradbury quickly attracted a large congregation and was appointed to a number of lectureships, notably at Salters' Hall and the Weigh House. He was a Merchants' lecturer at Pinners' Hall for over fifty years.<br>
<br>Bradbury emerged to public notice in London at a time when the toleration of dissenters was being threatened by the preaching of Dr Henry Sacheverell and other high-churchmen, and by the incitement of the mob against them. The incoming tory ministry of 1710 intensified the pressures on dissenters through the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Act</span> of 1711 and the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span> of 1714. Bradbury became an outspoken defender of religious liberty and supporter of the Hanoverian succession. His highly political sermons every 5 November, the anniversary of King William's landing in England as well as of the Gunpowder Plot, were notorious, but popular. Typical was &#145;The lawfulness of resisting tyrants&#146;, preached in 1713 and published in 1714, which ran to four editions. Most of his political sermons were included in his <span class="italic">Works</span>, published posthumously in 1762.<br>
<br>Some on his own side thought Bradbury too outspoken. <span class="italic">A Friendly epistle by way of reproof from one of the people called Quakers, to T B, a dealer in many words</span> appeared in 1715 from the pen of Daniel Defoe. Bradbury's practice of resorting to a tavern after preaching each 5 November to eat, drink, and sing raucously &#145;The Roast Beef of Old England&#146; attracted the criticism of both Isaac Watts and George Whitefield, who thought his behaviour unbecoming in a minister. But Bradbury, whose motto was <i>Pro Christo et patria</i> (for Christ and country), had made his mark. Queen Anne was said to have called him Bold Bradbury and to have tried to quieten him with a bishopric. The mob burnt his meeting-house in March 1710 and threatened him, but he escaped. According to his grandson, an assassin sent to kill him was converted by one of his sermons. Bradbury, alerted by a pre-arranged signal that Queen Anne had at last died&#151;a handkerchief falling from the gallery as he preached&#151;prayed for King George and boasted afterwards that he had been the first to proclaim the new reign. When attending the new court with other dissenting ministers in their black gowns to present a loyal address, he was asked by a courtier, &#145;Pray sir, is this a funeral?&#146;, to which Bradbury replied, &#145;Yes Sir, it is the funeral of the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span>, and the resurrection of liberty&#146;. These stories are well vouched for, if perhaps embroidered in the telling. However, the report that after Queen Anne's death he preached on the text &#145;Go, see now this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter&#146; is probably apocryphal, though he would have been capable of it.<br>
<br>In 1719 Bradbury became caught up in the Salters' Hall dispute. The trustees of four dissenting meetings in Exeter had barred three of the four ministers for refusing to subscribe to the declaration concerning the divinity of Christ and then appealed to the London ministers for guidance. A gathering of ministers of the three denominations at Salters' Hall duly considered a letter of advice designed to restore peace in Exeter. The draft, however, did not address the doctrinal issue. Bradbury moved a new clause affirming belief in the Trinity. This was lost by four votes, arguably because some thought the procedure out of order. At the resumed meeting Bradbury therefore proposed that before considering the advice further those present should subscribe to a declaration of belief in the Trinity. When the moderator, Joshua Oldfield, refused to put the proposal to the meeting, upwards of sixty ministers, led by Bradbury, moved to the gallery and subscribed their signatures to the declaration, while the smaller number who remained below did not. Each side then sent separate letters to Exeter, similar in the advice offered on resolving disputes between ministers and their congregations, but with marked differences in the forthrightness of commitment to trinitarian belief.<br>
<br>Bradbury's leading part in the dispute made him a target in the ensuing pamphlet war&#151;designed, he said, to destroy his reputation. The political charge against him was that the disunity he had caused among dissenters was of comfort only to their political enemies, and he lost a prominent whig politician, Shute Barrington, from his congregation. Barrington was thought to have written one of the highly personal attacks on Bradbury, <span class="italic">A Letter of Advice to the Protestant Dissenters</span> (1720). The religious charge was that he was a creed-maker who did not use the language of scripture and was trying to threaten liberty of religious belief. Bradbury's defence, in <span class="italic">An answer to the reproaches cast on those ministers who subscribed to their belief in the eternal Trinity</span> (1719), was that the original letter of advice to Exeter had been intended to be a screen for Arian ministers, and that the expression of trinitarian belief he had proposed was one to which dissenting ministers were required by law to assent, or had been drawn from the Westminster assembly's catechism. A move to exclude him from the Pinners' Hall lectures failed. The anti-Arian lectures held at Fetter Lane were an outcome of this simmering dispute. They were published as <span class="italic">The Power of Christ</span> (1724).<br>
<br>Bradbury's stand received support from outside dissent as well as within. William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, himself beset by some prominent questioners of trinitarian doctrine, wrote to Bradbury on 5 September 1721: &#145;I am glad to see that amidst our other much lesser differences we all stand fast and agree in contending for the faith as it was delivered to the saints&#146;  (Wilson, 3.521). Bradbury's most considered response to the issue behind the dispute was <span class="italic">The Mystery of Godliness</span> (1726), in which he put forward a scriptural basis for belief in the divinity of Christ.<br>
<br>While many regarded Bradbury as heroic and forthright, his delight in argument and controversy, and his inability to tolerate compromise or control his wit, led to a series of disputes. Though old friends, there was a serious falling out when Bradbury criticized Isaac Watts's <span class="italic">Psalms</span> (1719) and forbade the use of Watts's &#145;whims&#146; in his services. He was scornful of Watts's essay <span class="italic">The Christian Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1722) and of Watts's other efforts for accommodation with the anti-trinitarians. Relations between them were not helped by Bradbury's open dislike of two of Watts's closest friends, his co-pastor, Samuel Price, and the author of <span class="italic">The History of the Puritans</span>, Daniel Neal. The correspondence between the two men on these subjects does neither credit. In 1728 Bradbury had a disagreement with his deacons over a minor money matter, and led his supporters to New Court, Carey Street, where the two congregations successfully united under his ministry. That he could still call on friends of weight is shown by the speed with which he was able to clear a substantial debt on New Court. In the same year he quarrelled with the philanthropist William Coward, who resented Bradbury's advice on his will. Coward dismissed Bradbury from the Little St Helen's lectures, to which he had been appointed in 1726, though his continuing value as a protagonist led to an invitation to take part in the famous Lime Street lectures in defence of Calvinism in 1730. Like some other Independents he criticized Philip Doddridge for his accommodating attitude to the Methodists, but&#151;this short-lived disagreement apart&#151;the two men maintained good relations throughout. Bradbury supported Doddridge's students as a member of the Congregational Fund Board and Doddridge sought him out as preacher and dining companion whenever he was in London.<br>
<br>Bradbury married Mary Richmond (<i>d</i>. 1765), reportedly a widow of means, on 1 August 1717. They had two daughters. In 1744 one daughter married John Winter, an agent for the army and brother of Bradbury's successor at New Court, Richard Winter. Their son Dr Robert Winter, also later minister at New Court, helped preserve his grandfather's memory. The other daughter was married in 1768 to George Welch, a banker, who with Thomas Wilson founded the Societas Evangelica and Hoxton Academy in 1778. Bradbury's brother, Peter, who had been his assistant minister at Fetter Lane, continued at New Court until he married money. He resigned in 1731 and retired to an estate in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Doddridge feared that an illness in 1738 had brought Bradbury &#145;near Eternity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar</span>, ed. Nuttall, 518). Another in 1743 also concerned his friends. These, however, appear to have been the only interruptions of his sixty-two years' active ministry. He remained to the end a popular, patriotic preacher and an uncompromising leading figure in orthodox dissent among the Independents. Of all his collected sermons <span class="italic">The Christian's Joy in Finishing his Course</span> (1713), from before the years of theological controversy, was said to have given him most personal satisfaction. He preached his last sermon on 12 August 1759, the anniversary of the accession of George I, and fell ill shortly afterwards. He died, aged eighty-two, on 9 September 1759 and was buried in Bunhill Fields on 15 September. The next day, a Sunday, Richard Winter, his successor, and Thomas Hall, Independent minister at Moorfields, preached funeral sermons at New Court. His widow survived him and was buried on 28 September 1765.<br>
