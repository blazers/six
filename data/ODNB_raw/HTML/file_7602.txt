<span class="headword">Dickie,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1812, <em>d.</em> 1882), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was baptized at Old Machar, Aberdeen on 23 November 1812, the son of John Dickie, purser in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Isabella Fowler. Born in the house in which he was to spend most of his life, he was educated at the grammar school and Marischal College in Aberdeen, graduating AM from the latter in 1830. He then went on to study medicine at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh, qualifying as MRCS in 1834. His ambition of becoming a naval surgeon having had to be abandoned for domestic reasons, he then reluctantly entered into medical practice locally while devoting every spare moment to his real passion, field botany.<br>
<br>Already Dickie had explored the local countryside sufficiently to supply a list for the area to H. C. Watson's <span class="italic">New Botanist's Guide</span> (1832), and further work led to a slim <span class="italic">Flora Aberdonensis</span> (1838) and eventually to the rich store of information on which William Macgillivray was able to draw in 1855 for his pathmaking ecological essay, <span class="italic">The Natural History of Deeside and Braemar</span>. A fern found in a local cave was named <i>Cystopteris dickieana</i> in his honour; it was later found in several other parts of Scotland and widely in the Arctic, but its claims to be a separate species were disproved by allozyme study over a century and a half later. Dickie studied and collected extensively lichens and fungi, but it was seaweeds that from 1844 increasingly engaged his attention. These were at that period the subject of intensive investigation in which Dickie played a major part. In later years they would become his exclusive interest, and his expertise was such that collections received from around the world at Kew were regularly referred to him for determination and description. Though primarily a taxonomist, he was nevertheless also deeply interested in plant morphology and physiology.<br>
<br>In 1839 Dickie's botanical abilities were at last drawn on professionally with his appointment as lecturer in that subject, and the next year in materia medica as well, by King's College, Aberdeen, which conferred an honorary MD on him in 1842. In 1844 he was further appointed college librarian. From that strong foothold he moved in 1849 to the more substantial one of professor of natural history in the newly established Queen's College in Belfast, where his teaching responsibilities extended beyond botany and zoology to geology and physical geography. This Irish interlude was no less productive, considerably increasing knowledge of plant distribution in the northern half of the country and culminating in an excellent little <span class="italic">Flora of Ulster</span> (1864), which somewhat belied its name by taking in the botanically interesting area of Sligo and Leitrim as well. Most of the records in this were of his own making.<br>
<br>From Belfast Dickie returned to Aberdeen in 1860 on the creation of a separate botanical chair in the newly merged university, and that same year his long-delayed <span class="italic">Botanist's Guide to the Counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine</span> was finally published. That very first teaching session, however, he had the misfortune to develop pneumonia while leading a group of his students in the Cairngorms. This left him with chronic bronchitis and increasing deafness, removing him from active fieldwork and, by 1876, from any further teaching. Dickie was known for his intensely earnest manner and a deep piety, which did not prevent him early accepting Darwin's evolutionary theory. Retiring in 1877, Dickie died in Aberdeen on 15 July 1882, a year after the crowning of his career with election as a fellow of the Royal Society. He was survived by his wife, Agnes Williamson Low.<br>
