<span class="headword">Bird,  Robert Merttins</span>  (1788&#150;1853), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born in London on 1 September 1788, the son of Robert and Lucy Bird of Taplow, Buckinghamshire. He arrived in Bengal in 1808 as a writer and began his career as an assistant to the registrar of the court of appeal (<i>sadr diwani adalat</i>) in Calcutta. He was subsequently employed in various judicial capacities in Calcutta, Benares, and Jaunpur. In 1810 he married Jane Grant Brown, daughter of the chaplain <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3603/', "David Brown")</script> of the college of Fort William. Bird's first independent charge came in 1820, when he was appointed as judge and magistrate in Gorakhpur in the North-Western Provinces. Following the death of his wife, Bird remarried at Cape Town in 1824; his new wife was also called Jane.<br>
<br>In 1829, with his appointment as commissioner of revenue and circuit in Gorakhpur, Bird's career shifted from the judicial to the land revenue sphere and this was to be of immense importance to the history of the North-Western Provinces and British India more generally. In 1831 he was promoted to the <i>sadr</i> board of revenue on deputation, then spent a period as commissioner of the Farrukhabad division, and then rejoined the board in 1834. Bird gradually developed a remarkable knowledge of the land tenures of the country, and a formidable administrative capacity, and was soon regarded as one of the ablest revenue officers in the company's service. He was struck by the extent to which the legal framework of the existing settlement was often &#145;wholly distinct&#146; from the actual situation on the ground  (Mason, 1.296).<br>
<br>It was Holt Mackenzie who had carefully devised a land revenue system for the North-Western Provinces, designed to preserve ancient rights (especially of village communities) with a moderate squeeze on superior landholders, but his regulation 7 of 1822 had, in practice, proved laborious and too detailed. Bird was uneasy about the difficulties that had emerged in its workings and wished &#145;to have each fact fixed before I found a principle upon it&#146;  (Husain, 199); he wanted to adopt a more empirical approach based on the revenue history of the villages in place of the deductive and theoretical methods hitherto used.<br>
<br>In 1832 Lord William Bentinck (governor-general, 1828&#150;35) undertook a review of the land revenue policy of the North-Western Provinces. Bird put forward a strong case for the protection of the rights of peasant cultivators linked with a fixed, but not permanent, settlement of the revenue demand. Fixed rents should not be arbitrary but should be calculated from the money rents then prevailing in the North-Western Provinces, although, in practice, rough and ready reckoning was still required; this was in place of the previous, more theoretically based method of calculating rent in the form of net produce, which involved an estimate of the average gross produce of different soils and the subtraction from it of nominal values for profits and wages.<br>
<br>Bird firmly believed that the cultivators, except tenants at will, had the right to a fixed rent and that this would not infringe the rights of the superior land revenue holders (the <i>zamindars</i>, rajas, and <i>talukdars</i>) whose interests did not arise directly from the land  (Husain, 199). He was equally convinced that no right of property existed between the cultivator and the monarch; he found the ideal principles (though not necessarily implementation) of land revenue settlement in Sir Thomas Munro's ryotwari system in Madras, which alone preserved, in his view, the &#145;pure original system of Indian revenue administration&#146;  (Metcalf, 61).<br>
<br>This inevitably led Bird to favour the resident cultivators over the traditional intermediaries; he considered, for instance, the <i>zamindars</i> as &#145;a host of unproductives&#146; wasting their resources on expensive marriages and other extravagant habits  (Husain, 199&#150;200). Such criticism of the superior land revenue holders was not new in 1832, but Bird's practical zeal in pursuit of a fixed settlement with resident cultivators was. Despite his considerable awareness of the historical background of land revenue in the North-Western Provinces, he was still capable of &#145;passionate dogmatic assertion&#146; when it suited  (Rosselli, 259).<br>
<br>When, in 1833, Bentinck revised the revenue system of the North-Western Provinces through regulation 9, Bird was chosen to oversee the task. Its implementation, therefore, bore his imprint aided by subordinates of his own choice with whom he worked closely. He also recognized the important contribution of able Indian personnel. The new settlement was intended to be simpler than that of regulation 7, setting provisional revenue demands for similar tracts and then working from the aggregate to the detail. It involved the survey of each village and the preparation of a map showing individual fields, land held in severalty and that held collectively, and a village register to record the boundaries and the rights, privileges, and liabilities that went with them; a thirty-year settlement was to be made either with individual cultivators, a landholder, or the village brotherhood (which did not necessarily include all the inhabitants), but only where such rights already existed. Bird was also careful to involve village accountants in the new method, an element of popular scrutiny was provided for, and he established a system of local self-government. While his survey was not perfect, it was much superior to anything that had gone before and was the most complete that had yet been made in India.<br>
<br>Bird's energy and determination meant that the revision was completed within ten years. In that time an area of 23,000 square miles with a population of about 23 million was surveyed; in 1867 Marshman described this as &#145;the greatest fiscal achievement of the Company's Government&#146;  (Marshman, 3.48). By the time that Bird retired from India in 1842, the land system of the North-Western Provinces had taken on the basic shape that it was to retain until the end of British rule. The new settlement, in the event, did not just record existing land revenue practice but initiated significant social and economic changes. Through the fixing of rights and obligations land took on a market value as never before. Bird did not share Bentinck's desire to sustain a superior land revenue holding class. He wanted instead to create a more egalitarian society justified through &#145;a desire for the welfare of the people&#146; and &#145;the greatest happiness principle&#146;  (Husain, 200).<br>
<br>Bird's own view of his achievement was not straightforward. He could simultaneously argue that ryots varied from settled tenants to &#145;mere labourers&#146; and yet that all shared certain rights; he could also view the result of regulation 9 as being in favour of the collective village brotherhoods and yet facilitating &#145;the sale of land to a degree which never existed before&#146;  (Rosselli, 259). In the aftermath of the Indian mutiny land sales were often identified as a major factor in breaking up the village community and the stability it gave; this debate of cause and effect still continues. Bird also helped form a school of administration in the North-Western Provinces which, after further moulding by James Thomason (lieutenant-governor 1843&#150;53), played an important role in consolidating British rule in the Punjab after 1849.<br>
<br>Bird retired from India in 1842 and spent the rest of his life in Britain in relative obscurity. His life and career were characterized by a strong evangelical commitment and, on returning to England, he became an active member of the Church Missionary Society and undertook much work on its behalf. He was widowed once more, and married, on 1 March 1848, Henrietta Maria Jane Grenfell, daughter of Pascoe Grenfell of Taplow. In 1853 he was called upon to give evidence before the committee of the House of Commons considering the renewal of the East India Company's charter. He died soon afterwards, at Taplow Hill Lodge, Termoham, Torquay, on 22 August 1853, making provision in his will for five sons and three daughters.<br>
