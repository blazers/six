<span class="headword">Prior,  Arthur Norman</span>  (1914&#150;1969), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 4 December 1914 in Masterton, New Zealand, the only child of Norman Henry Prior, physician, and his wife, Elizabeth Munton Rothesay Teague, who died two weeks after giving birth. He grew up with two brothers and a sister from his father's second marriage. Educated at Wairarapa high school in Masterton, he took a BA in philosophy and psychology (1935) and an MA in philosophy (1936) at Otago University, Dunedin. The grandson of two Methodist missionaries in Australia, he became a Presbyterian at university and was active in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) as a Christian socialist. In 1937 he married an SCM colleague, Claire Hunter, and sailed to Europe. For three years the couple lived a bohemian existence, supported principally by religious journalism. In 1940 Prior returned to New Zealand and worked as a railwayman, dock labourer, and hotel bellman before joining the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1942. In 1943 his first marriage was dissolved and he married Mary Laura Wilkinson, daughter of Frank Howitt Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 2012), a Presbyterian minister of Timaru, New Zealand. She was then a zoology undergraduate at Otago and was later to become a historian and author of an acclaimed study of <span class="italic">Women in English Society, 1500&#150;1800</span> (1986). One son and one daughter were born to this happy marriage.<br>
<br>On demobilization Prior resumed the academic career he had begun at Otago as assistant lecturer under John Findlay in 1937. From 1946 to 1958 he taught philosophy at the University of Canterbury at Christchurch, as lecturer, senior lecturer, and (from 1952) professor. Initially isolated as a philosopher, he frequented the literary group around Charles Brasch which ran the journal <span class="italic">Landfall</span>. His earliest philosophical publications concerned religion and ethics; his first book, <span class="italic">Logic and the Basis of Ethics</span> (1949), combined historical erudition with contemporary relevance in a manner typical of him throughout his life.<br>
<br>The logic of that title was very informal, but soon Prior began to take an interest in logic which, if at first traditional, was much more formal. In 1951 he completed a 220,000 word textbook entitled &#145;The craft of formal logic&#146;; it was never published in his lifetime, but a shorter and almost totally rewritten version was published in 1955 as <span class="italic">Formal Logic</span>. By now Prior had shifted his attention from traditional logic to the mathematical logic in which henceforth he worked; this change was largely due to the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz, in homage to whom he used, throughout his life, the unfashionable Polish logical notation.<br>
<br>In 1954, taking cues from the modal logic of the Stoics and from some remarks on time by Findlay, Prior conceived the idea that the logical relationships between sentences in past, present, and future tenses could be set out as a self-standing branch of logic. In the same year he hosted a visit to New Zealand by Gilbert Ryle, and impressed him with the clarity and independence of his thought. He received, and accepted, an invitation to visit Oxford to give the John Locke lectures.<br>
<br>In these lectures, delivered in the first six months of 1956, Prior presented his new ideas on the relationship between modal logic and the grammar of tense. Their publication in 1957 as <span class="italic">Time and Modality</span> launched the tense-logic that he was to pursue until 1968 and that was to be developed by many other logicians before and after his death. Tense-logic is significant for metaphysics as showing the coherence of the thesis that tense belongs to the real and not just to the mental world; but it also has importance for linguistics and computer science.<br>
<br>In Oxford in 1956 Prior met many British logicians, helped to organize logic colloquia, and lectured in many universities. He quickly made his name in the British philosophical community, and he accepted an invitation to hold a newly created chair of philosophy in Manchester. At the end of 1958 he and his family left New Zealand for good. While at Christchurch he had been ordained as a church elder. On arrival in England in 1959 he severed his links with Presbyterianism, though he retained an expert knowledge of Scottish Calvinism until his death.<br>
<br>Prior held the Manchester chair for six years. During this time he published many insightful, and often provocative, papers on metaphysics. His researches into tense-logic led him to reflect on the nature of time and on traditional problems about foreknowledge and determinism, the persistence of substances through time, and the criteria for identity and the reidentification of individuals. The papers he published on these topics were original contributions to ongoing philosophical debates; but in all of them he was able to draw on an extraordinary reservoir of knowledge of medieval logic as well as post-Reformation theology. Most of his papers on these topics were collected in the volume <span class="italic">Papers on Time and Tense</span>, published in 1968 just before his death.<br>
<br>In 1962 Prior spent a quarter at Chicago as a visiting professor. In 1963 he was elected as a fellow of the British Academy, and in 1965&#150;6 he held the Flint professorship of philosophy at the University of California at Los Angeles. There he was surrounded, for the first time, by enthusiasts for tense-logic. With the aid of colleagues and pupils he worked out a new and mathematically much more sophisticated presentation of his system, published in 1967 as <span class="italic">Past, Present and Future</span>, a book which surveyed the whole field which had developed from the initial enrichment of classical logical calculi with symbols for forming past and future tenses. It presented different formal systems corresponding to different traditional positions about time, fate, and chance.<br>
<br>On his return to Manchester in January 1966 Prior received an invitation from Balliol College, Oxford, to take up a tutorial fellowship recently vacated by R. M. Hare. Though the transition involved an increased teaching load and a loss of salary and status, Prior accepted the invitation and quickly became one of the most valued members of Balliol's governing body. His college fellowship went with a university lecturership, which was upgraded to a readership in 1969.<br>
<br>Throughout his life, whether at Christchurch, Manchester, or Oxford, Prior was an inspiring and selfless teacher. He and his wife kept open house for his pupils at all hours. They never set up defences to keep private life separate from academic. They were generous hosts, happy to allow friends to use their Shropshire cottage or to join them in cruises on the canals which they loved. Prior had a special gift for making friends with children, entering into their games and sharing their fantasies. Throughout life he himself preserved the virtues of childhood in the open frankness of his friendship and the wide-eyed enthusiasm of his curiosity. He was quite free of pretence or pomp, and could never be persuaded to take trouble over the appearance of his clothes or his hair.<br>
<br>When following a new line in research, Prior could write at enormous speed and in the most adverse circumstances; <span class="italic">Formal Logic</span> was largely completed in nine weeks, and the first version of tense-logic was worked out during horrible months while he was nursing his two children through tuberculosis and his wife was hospitalized with the same disease.<br>
<br>In 1969 Prior's first Balliol sabbatical fell due: he arranged to spend it at the University of Oslo. But during the previous year he had suffered from both rheumatism and angina pectoris, and though he obtained initial relief from cortisone in Norway he suffered a lethal heart attack on 7 October 1969. He was cremated in Trondheim, where he had died, and a memorial ceremony was held in Balliol. Between 1971 and 1976 three volumes of his writings were published posthumously (<span class="italic">Objects of Thought</span>, <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Propositions and Terms</span>, and <span class="italic">Papers in Logic and Ethics</span>, all edited by Peter Geach and Anthony Kenny). An unfinished work was completed by K. Fine and published as <span class="italic">Worlds, Times and Selves</span> in 1979. Prior's papers were deposited in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.<br>
