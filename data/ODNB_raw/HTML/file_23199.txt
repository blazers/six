<span class="headword">Rawson,  John</span>, Viscount Clontarff  (1470?&#150;1547?), <span class="occ">prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in Ireland and administrator</span>, was descended from a family long established at Water Fryston in Yorkshire. His father, Richard Rawson, was an alderman of London in 1476&#150;7, senior warden of the Mercers' Company from 1478 to 1483, and sometime sheriff of London. His mother was Isabella Craford (<i>d</i>. 1497). His brother Richard (<i>d</i>. 1543) was chaplain to Henry VIII and archdeacon of Essex. John was the eldest son, and in 1492 was admitted free of the Mercers' Company. However, he joined the order of the knights of St John before 1497. In 1510 he was dispatched to Rome on a mission representing his order and <i>en route</i> was received by the doge at Venice. The following year he was appointed prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham, Dublin. This office carried with it the headship of the order in Ireland and a seat in the Irish house of peers. At that time, Rawson was sworn a member of the privy council. He also held the preceptories of Quenington, Gloucestershire, and Swinfield.<br>
<br>In 1515 Rawson and the earl of Kildare dined with the king at Greenwich, and in that year he was commended by Fabrizio del Carretto, grand master of the order, for his good management at Kilmainham. In 1517 he was appointed treasurer of Ireland. The following year he was summoned to the defence of Rhodes, then besieged by the Ottomans. In 1519 he obtained a licence from the king to travel abroad for three years but he apparently did not leave England since his licence was revoked and he was obliged to return to Ireland in July 1520 with Lord Lieutenant Surrey. Further to Cardinal Wolsey's representations on his behalf, Rawson was appointed treasurer in February 1522. He remained in Ireland until March of that year and then appears to have travelled to Rhodes, as his name features at the head of the list of English knights reviewed there by the grand master, Philippe Villiers de l'Isle Adam in 1522. Following the surrender of Rhodes on 20 December 1522 Rawson returned to Ireland. In 1525 he again received a licence to travel abroad for three years and to retain his benefices and revenues in his absence. In June 1527 he accompanied Villiers de l'Isle Adam to Corneto in Italy and that same month he was appointed turcopolier or commander of the turcopoles or light infantry of the order. This office carried with it the headship of the English <i>langue</i> of the order and responsibility for the coastal defences of Malta.<br>
<br>In September 1528 Henry VIII reappointed Rawson treasurer of Ireland and in 1529 he served as under-treasurer. From September 1529 to August 1530 Rawson was a member of the secret council of Ireland which served as deputy lieutenant to Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond. In 1532 he travelled to England for consultations with the king and he also participated in the proceedings against Sir William Skeffington. He remained loyal to the crown during the Kildare rebellion. During the revolt his property was plundered by the insurgents and he was present at the surrender of Old Ross Castle in Wexford. In August 1534 he was at St David's in Wales, <i>en route</i> to inform Henry VIII of recent events in Ireland, but was unable to travel to the court as he was &#145;much diseased with the palsy, and may not well endure to ride&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, vol. 2, pt 3, p. 201). In September 1535 Sir William Brabazon recommended Rawson to Cromwell as a suitable candidate for the lord chancellorship, but his advice was ignored.<br>
<br>By 1538 Rawson was elderly and very feeble. However, he was sufficiently active to arouse the animosity of George Browne, archbishop of Dublin, who termed him &#145;the pecuniose prior of Kilmainham&#146;. He was also still shrewd enough to anticipate the monastic suppression campaign by leasing parcels of the property of Kilmainham Priory at low rates, particularly to family members. In September 1540 Lord Deputy St Leger and the Irish council requested that Rawson be elevated to the honour of Viscount Clontarff. After prolonged negotiations he surrendered the priory of Kilmainham on 22 November 1540 and subsequently received a pension of 500 marks. In December of the same year he was granted an annuity of 200 marks for life, payable out of the dissolved possessions of the order's property in Gloucestershire. On 20 June 1541 he was created Viscount Clontarff for life and was granted an annual fee of &pound;10. He assumed the arms of his maternal family. In 1542 he is said to have been unlikely to live much longer, &#145;not well able to live &hellip; being now in manner impotent&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, vol. 3, pt 3, p. 438). Yet he continued to attend council sessions until 1543. The date of his death is uncertain. He is thought to have died in 1547 when Oswald Massingberd was appointed grand master to succeed him as titular prior of Kilmainham. Some peerages state that he died in 1560 but his age makes this improbable. He had at least one natural child: a daughter named Katherine who married Rowland, son of Patrick White, baron of the Irish exchequer, and it has been suggested that the Sir John Rawson who frequently appears in Irish records during Elizabeth's reign may have been his son. Upon Clontarff's death the peerage became extinct.<br>
