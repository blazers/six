<span class="headword">MacIver,  Robert Morrison</span>  (1882&#150;1970), <span class="occ">political theorist and sociologist</span>, was born on 17 April 1882 at North Beach Street, Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, the third child of Donald MacIver, a successful tweed merchant and a devout member of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Christina Morrison. MacIver was schooled at the Nicholson Institute, Stornoway. His early childhood was happy, and he delighted in the outdoor life of the island, but in adolescence he concluded that he could not subscribe to his father's puritanical brand of Christianity, and began to feel oppressed by the piety of his home. His longing for escape was satisfied when, at the early age of sixteen, he won a scholarship to Edinburgh University. He took a first in classics in 1903. He then moved on to Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a first in Greats in 1907, in spite of having spent the week before his final examinations playing golf at Huntercombe.<br>
<br>Although his undergraduate studies had been in classics, MacIver's real interest lay in political theory and sociology, and in 1907 he became a lecturer in political science at Aberdeen. Here he began to develop his political ideas in a series of articles and in a book, <span class="italic">Community</span> (1917). MacIver was critical of the idealist school, which still dominated British political philosophy at this time, arguing that its exponents, in particular Bernard Bosanquet, had made dangerously inflated claims for the power of the state. He warned that the idealist state threatened to engulf other forms of human association. Instead MacIver advanced an alternative theory of the state, insisting that it was merely a subordinate organ of the wider community, and that its remit was thus strictly limited. He developed this idea of the state more fully in <span class="italic">The Modern State</span> (1926).<br>
<br>MacIver's thought was a notable contribution to the wider attack on the idealist theory of the state made around the time of the First World War. In this respect his ideas resembled those of pluralist authors such as Harold Laski and J. N. Figgis, and MacIver was sometimes wrongly bracketed with them. But whereas the pluralists disowned any idea that society had a common purpose, MacIver's theory of community emphasized its harmony and common purpose. His writings were notable for their optimistic belief in social progress and in the identity of interest between individual and society.<br>
<br>In 1915 MacIver accepted a chair in political science at Toronto. He was vice chairman of the Canadian War Labour Board from 1917 until 1919. He spent the rest of his career in North America, which he greatly preferred to what he saw as the class-ridden society of Britain. Paradoxically, though, it was in Britain that his writings were most acclaimed; among British champions of his ideas were James Bryce, George Unwin, Ernest Barker, and Archbishop William Temple.<br>
<br>In 1927 MacIver moved to Columbia University, where, as Lieber professor of political philosophy and sociology from 1929 until 1950, he sought to develop the teaching of sociology. He produced several more books, among them <span class="italic">Society: a Textbook of Sociology</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Leviathan and the People</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Web of Government</span> (1947). But his writings lost their vogue after the Second World War. His interdisciplinary approach and his optimism about society seemed dated, and he felt increasingly at odds with the direction taken by academic sociology, deploring its obsession with quantitative method. His versatility meant that he was nevertheless still in great demand as the author of official reports. He published research studies on academic freedom, race relations, the United Nations, and juvenile delinquency. Between 1963 and 1966 he was successively president and chancellor of the New School for Social Research in New York. He received eight honorary degrees, and was a fellow of both the Royal Society of Canada and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1911 MacIver married Ethel Marion Peterkin (<i>b</i>. 1884/5), who had been one of his students at Aberdeen. In his autobiography, <span class="italic">As a Tale that is Told</span> (1968), he described this as a very happy union, though he also alluded to some extramarital affairs. MacIver had three children, of whom one son predeceased him. He died at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, on 15 June 1970.<br>
