<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martyn,  John</span>  (1699&#150;1768), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 12 September 1699 in Queen Street in the City of London, the son of Thomas Martyn (<i>d</i>. 1743), a merchant trading with Hamburg, and Katherine Weedon, who died the year after her son's birth. He was sent to a private school in the City of London, where he evidently received an excellent classical education, and left at sixteen to work in his father's counting-house off Cheapside. By then, however, botany had developed into a strong competing interest and he began to turn his sights to a more congenial career in medicine. He owed this change of direction to his acquaintance with John Wilmer (1697&#150;1769), a young apothecary with a fondness for plant-hunting and entomology, whom he met in 1718, and through whom he presently gained introductions to several leading figures in botanico-medical circles.<br>
<br>A particularly fruitful contact proved to be Patrick Blair, then in Lincolnshire struggling to rebuild his medical fortunes after being imprisoned because of his involvement in the Jacobite rebellion. Cut off from fellow spirits there, Blair entered into a correspondence with Martyn, which was to last several years, discussing with him a possible natural system of classifying plants based on their cotyledons and stimulating him to extend his collecting to birds and their eggs. After Blair's death in 1728 Martyn saw his <span class="italic">Pharmaco-botanologia</span> through the press. <span class="italic">The Compleat Herbal</span> (1716&#150;30), a translation of the Latin edition of Tournefort's <span class="italic">El&eacute;mens de botanique</span> attributed to Martyn, may have been started by Blair.<br>
<br>Martyn was a devotee of Tournefort's writings and, having acquired and translated his <span class="italic">History of Plants Growing about Paris</span> in 1720, conceived the idea of producing a London equivalent. To that end he made many excursions into the surrounding countryside, attended the &#145;herbarizings&#146; of the Society of Apothecaries, and began to put together a <i>hortus siccus</i>. Within a year he had taken the further step of forming a botanical society, the earliest one known in Britain to have been formally constituted. Taking on the secretaryship himself, he recruited as president Dillenius, just then a newcomer from Germany; the other members, of whom there were scarcely ever more than twenty, were medical students in the main. For the next six years the society met each Saturday evening in the Rainbow Coffee House on Watling Street and, as one surviving minute book attests, listened to papers on a good spread of topics. Many finds of rarities reported by its members were later published in Martyn's eventual version of Tournefort's book, which by the time it appeared in 1732 had assumed the character of a national flora and was tantamount to a supplement to the standard handbook of the period, Dillenius's edition of Ray's <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>.<br>
<br>Early in the society's existence Martyn delivered a series of lectures to it expounding current botanical terminology. These he subsequently published and, after the society's demise, worked up into a more general botanical course which he offered on a commercial basis. This led to an invitation in 1727 to repeat the lectures for the benefit of the medical students at Cambridge. The occupant of the university's chair of botany, Richard Bradley, though skilled in the applied and experimental aspects of the subject, was ill-equipped to provide the standard fare of contemporary medical teaching and the students were apparently desperate. Martyn, who was recommended by Hans Sloane and William Sherard, made the most of this opportunity and honour by hastily producing at his own expense an updated version of Ray's Cambridgeshire flora and distributing free copies to those attending his course. An interleaved copy of this rare octavo volume, <span class="italic">Methodus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium</span>, copiously annotated by him, survives in the university's department of plant sciences.<br>
<br>This taste of academia evidently heightened Martyn's ambitions. That same year he secured election to the Royal Society and set up in practice, apparently as an apothecary, in St Helen's, in the heart of the City of London, augmenting his income by lecturing on botany and materia medica. The first part of what was to be his boldest and most sumptuous venture, <span class="italic">Historia plantarum rariorum</span>, followed in 1728. Noteworthy for some of the earliest examples of colour printing from a single plate, the work of Elisha Kirkall, it drew extensively on drawings by the Dutch flower painter Jacob van Huysum for its illustrations, and on the expertise of Philip Miller for its horticultural notes. Like all too many such productions, though, it failed to attract sufficient support and, after four further parts, had to be discontinued in 1737.<br>
<br>A further setback to Martyn's ambitions was an unsuccessful bid to become second secretary of the Royal Society, on the death of William Rutty in 1730. That same year his ready pen found a further, if surprising, outlet in a new satirical weekly, the <span class="italic">Grub-Street Journal</span>. Its proclaimed policy was &#145;to restrain the enormities of our worse brethren, proceeding from their want of integrity and knowledge&#146;. Joint editor at first for a year and then an occasional contributor, Martyn sheltered behind pseudonyms to hold up to ridicule a variety of leading learned figures. Prominent among these was the hapless Bradley, who had published his Cambridge lectures on materia medica and, because of his misuse of the word in one of those, became a thinly disguised &#145;Professor Hecatomb&#146;.<br>
<br>This sniping at Bradley had a deeper motive: Martyn coveted his chair, which, although it had no endowment, carried prestige and could be expected to advance a medical career. On Sloane's advice Martyn resolved to arm himself with a university degree. To that end he returned to Cambridge in 1730 and, in the steps of his great-grandfather, entered Emmanuel College as a fellow-commoner. After keeping five terms, however, the calls of his London practice and, in 1732, marriage to Eulalia, daughter of John King DD, rector of Chelsea and prebendary of York, put paid to his intention of graduating. In consideration of his earlier lecturing services Martyn nevertheless felt that he was owed the professorship of botany, and on Bradley's death in 1732 canvassed energetically to succeed him. After countering a baseless rumour that he was a nonjuror, he secured election in February 1733. He began well, taking his students out on field excursions, but after three years the lengthy absences from his London practice told afresh and, on the pretext of the lack of a botanic garden to enable him to illustrate his teaching, he turned into the stereotype of an eighteenth-century absentee professor and had no more to do with Cambridge for almost thirty years, resigning only in 1762 on the election of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18239/', "Thomas Martyn")</script> in his place.<br>
<br>Martyn became disillusioned, and his botanical activity diminished after his university d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. However, his correspondence with Linnaeus, initiated by his receipt from the Swedish naturalist about 1737 of a copy of his recently published <span class="italic">Flora Lapponica</span>, was noteworthy. Always a keen Latinist, Martyn devoted his later years to producing an edition of Virgil, with a translation and natural history notes. Of this, he published the <span class="italic">Georgicks</span> in 1741 and the <span class="italic">Bucolicks</span> in 1749, but of the <span class="italic">Aeneids</span> he left only fragmentary material, which was seen into print after his death.<br>
<br>In 1730 Martyn left the City of London on account of an asthmatic condition and went to live and practise in the more salubrious environment of Chelsea, where the Physic Garden was conveniently close. His first wife, with whom he had three sons and five daughters, died in 1749. The next year he married Mary Anne, daughter of Claude Fonnereau, a London merchant; they had one son. Two years later he retired from practice and moved out to Hill House, a farm on Streatham Common. Persistent attacks of gout, however, undermined his enjoyment of that rural existence and eventually he retreated back to Chelsea, where he died on 29 January 1768. He was buried in the churchyard of what is now Chelsea Old Church.<br>
<br>&#145;Mus. Martyn&#146;, as Martyn's herbarium is still known, was presented to Cambridge University along with his botanical library and collection of materia medica when his son succeeded to the chair, but much of it was subsequently lost through poor curation. The surviving portion contains some type specimens and incorporates one or two small collections of historic interest made by botanist contemporaries. A genus of tropical American plants, <i>Martynia</i>, was named by his friend William Houstoun in his honour. The later recognition of a new family, Martyniaceae (unicorn plants), has resulted in his being commemorated at that higher level as well.<br>
