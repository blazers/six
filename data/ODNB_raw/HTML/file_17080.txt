</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowe, Sir  Hudson</span>  (1769&#150;1844), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, born in Galway, Ireland, on 28 July 1769, was the son of Hudson Lowe (<i>d</i>. 1801) and his wife, the daughter of J. Morgan of Galway.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlyarmycareer"></a>Family and early army career</h2>The elder Hudson Lowe, from a Lincolnshire family long settled near Grantham, was for over thirty years surgeon of the 50th foot, and afterwards, as staff surgeon-major and assistant inspector of hospitals, head of the medical department at Gibraltar, where he died. The younger Hudson was born while his father was with his regiment in Galway, and he went with it to Jamaica in late 1772. After nearly four years the 50th moved to North America, where most of the men were dispersed to other regiments. However, in November 1776 Lowe's father returned to England with a recruiting party to Salisbury, and the younger Hudson attended school there. In the autumn of 1778 the regiment, now up to strength, settled at Plymouth. Hudson Lowe apparently became an ensign in the East Devon militia, passing review with it before the age of twelve, which does not necessarily prove that he joined his father at Plymouth. The 50th moved to Gibraltar in 1784, where Lowe served as a volunteer in 1785&#150;6, and was gazetted ensign on 25 September 1787, advancing to lieutenant in the regiment on 16 November 1791, and captain-lieutenant and captain on 6 September 1795. Meanwhile, he had travelled on leave through Italy, picking up an intimate knowledge of Italian and French. On the outbreak of war he rejoined his regiment at Gibraltar and served with it at Toulon (1793) and at the capture of Corsica (1794), taking part in the attack on the great Martello tower, the storming of the Convention redoubt, and the sieges of Bastia and Calvi. He remained two years in garrison at Ajaccio, then went with the 50th to Elba, where he was deputy judge-advocate. Subsequently he was stationed in Portugal for two years and became proficient in Portuguese, having already obtained a good knowledge of Spanish. From Lisbon he moved in 1799 to Minorca, where he was made one of the inspectors of foreign corps and put at the head of 200 anti-republican Corsicans&#151;styled the Corsican rangers&#151;with the rank of major-commandant from 5 July 1800. He commanded the corps in Egypt in 1801 at the landing and in the operations before Alexandria and the advance on Cairo, winning the approval of Brigadier-General John Moore, who remarked on one occasion: &#145;When Lowe's at the outposts I'm sure of a good night&#146;. For his services in Egypt he received the Turkish gold medal. The Corsican rangers were disbanded at Malta after the peace of Amiens, and Lowe was put on half pay.<h2>
<a name="WarintheMediterranean"></a>War in the Mediterranean</h2>In 1803, on the recommendation of Moore, Lowe was appointed one of the new permanent assistants in the quartermaster-general's department and was stationed at Plymouth, from where, in July, he was dispatched to Portugal to inspect the troops and defences on the north and north-eastern frontiers; and he reported the feasibility of defending the country with a mixed British and Portuguese force. He was then sent to Malta to raise a new and larger corps of foreign men, to be called the Royal Corsican rangers, as major-commandant from 15 October 1803 and lieutenant-colonel-commandant from 25 June 1804. Following a mission to Sardinia, where his report on the state of the island saved a proposed subsidy, in 1805 Lowe went with his corps to Naples, under Lieutenant-General Sir James Henry Craig, and commanded the advance from Castellamare towards the Abruzzi. When the British retired to Sicily he was detached with part of his corps, the rest joining him, after the battle of Maida in July 1806, at Capri, where he was reinforced later by the Malta regiment. On his own responsibility he humanely appealed to Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier, chief of the staff of the army of Naples, against the frequent French military executions of Calabrese fugitives. Lowe occupied Capri from 11 June 1806 until 20 October 1808, when, after thirteen days' siege&#151;the Malta regiment having been made prisoners and the defences of Capri breached&#151;he surrendered to a French force under General Count Jean-Maximin Lamarque. He blamed the disaster on the absence of naval aid and the conduct of the Malta regiment. Deeply upset by the omission from the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> of his detailed dispatch, he thought of leaving the service.<br>
<br>Lowe commanded the Royal Corsican rangers in the expedition to the Bay of Naples in 1809 and distinguished himself at the capture of Ischia. He then acted as second in command of the expedition to the Ionian Islands (1809&#150;10), led the attacking force at Zante (Z&aacute;kynthos), was present at the capture of Cephalonia and Ithaca, and the capture of Santa Maura (Leukas). Lowe was put in command of the left division of the troops in the Ionian Islands and entrusted with the provisional government of Cephalonia, Ithaca, and Santa Maura, which he administered without remuneration for two years. He also addressed a general report about the Ionian Islands to the Colonial Office. On leaving, the inhabitants presented him with a sword of honour. He was promoted colonel-commandant of the Royal Corsican rangers on 1 January 1812 and retained that post until the corps was disbanded at the beginning of 1817. He returned home on leave in February 1812, reputedly having been on active service continuously since 1793, with only six months in England during the peace of Amiens.<h2>
<a name="InnorthernEurope"></a>In northern Europe</h2>In January 1813 Lowe was sent to inspect the Russian German Legion&#151;a force composed of German fugitives from the Moscow retreat&#151;which was to be paid by Britain. He travelled to Stockholm, then crossed the Gulf of Bothnia on the ice to inspect the legion, which was scattered along the Baltic coasts. Afterwards, he went on to Kalisch (Kalisz) in Poland, where an anti-French treaty had been signed by Russia and Prussia. He remained with the Russian army for the ensuing campaign, being present at the battles of Bautzen (where he first saw Napoleon) and W&uuml;rschen. During the short-lived armistice (June&#150;July 1813) he inspected some 20,000 levies in British pay in north Germany, and joined Major-General Sir Charles Stewart at the headquarters of Crown Prince Bernadotte of Sweden. Stewart sent Lowe to the headquarters of the Prussian army of Silesia under Marshal Bl&uuml;cher, with whom he was present at M&ouml;ckern, at the great battles around Leipzig, and at the pursuit of the French to the Rhine. He then resumed his inspections in north Germany and at the end of the year was ordered to organize a new body of Dutch levies in the Netherlands. This plan was abandoned, apparently at his own request, and on 24 January 1814 he rejoined Bl&uuml;cher at Vaucouleurs, being subsequently present with the Prussians at thirteen general engagements. As the only British officer of rank with Bl&uuml;cher's army, Lowe was privy to many important deliberations, especially during the conferences at Ch&acirc;tillon, where he strongly advocated the advance on Paris. He was the first officer to bring to England the news of Napoleon's abdication, arriving in London on 9 April 1814, after having ridden from Paris to Calais through potentially hostile country attended by a single cossack.<br>
<br>Lowe was knighted on 26 April 1814 and promoted major-general on 4 June. He also received the Russian cross of St George and the Prussian order of military merit. When the allies withdrew from France, he became quartermaster-general of the army in the Low Countries under the command of William Frederick, prince of Orange. Upon the news of Napoleon's return from Elba, which reached Brussels early in March 1815, Lowe, with permission of the prince of Orange, dispatched a British staff officer to the Prussian commanders between the Rhine and Meuse, urging a concentration on the Meuse, to co-operate in the defence of the Southern Netherlands. After the Prussians had begun to move, the prince of Orange changed his mind; but Lowe refused to issue counter-orders. Six years later, on 18 March 1821, in a letter to Earl Bathurst from St Helena, Lowe asserted that Napoleon had made a firm proposal for the king of the Netherlands to give up his claims to the Southern Netherlands, offering to procure for him indemnities in the north of Germany. The duke of Wellington assumed command in the Netherlands early in April 1815, and Lowe remained for a few weeks under him as his quartermaster-general, but he was condemned by the duke as a &#145;damned old fool&#146;  (Longford, 482) for hesitant map-reading and was replaced in May by Colonel Sir William Howe de Lancey. The day after the battle of Waterloo, Lowe took command at Genoa of troops gathered to co-operate with Austro-Sardinian forces. In July, in conjunction with a naval squadron under Admiral Sir Edward Pellew, he occupied Marseilles, and then marched against Toulon, where, in concert with the royalists, he drove out the Napoleonic garrison.<h2>
<a name="GuardingNapoleon18151821"></a>Guarding Napoleon, 1815&#150;1821</h2>At Marseilles, on 1 August 1815, Lowe received intimation that he would have the custody of Napoleon, who had taken refuge on the <i>Bellerophon</i>, in Aix Roads, a fortnight previously. On Lowe's departure from Marseilles, the citizens of the town presented him with a silver urn bearing an inscription alluding to his having saved the city from being pillaged. The island of St Helena in the south Atlantic was a possession of the East India Company, and on 23 August the court of directors notified him that they had appointed him governor with a salary of &pound;12,000 a year. No stipulation was made as to pension, which explains why his critics could later claim that he was not considered eligible for pension. On 12 September he received from Bathurst, secretary of state for war and the colonies, preliminary instructions about dealing with Napoleon. He obtained the local rank of lieutenant-general on 9 November, and on 4 January 1816 he was made KCB.<br>
<br>In London, on 16 December 1815, Lowe married Susan Johnson (1779/80&#150;1832), daughter of Stephen de Lancey, sister of Colonel Sir William Howe de Lancey, and widow of Colonel William Johnson. From her first marriage she had two daughters surviving, one marrying Count Balmain, the Russian commissioner at St Helena during Napoleon's captivity. With Lowe she had two sons and a daughter, all of whom were born on St Helena. The younger son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17079/', "Edward William Howe de Lancy Lowe")</script>. Lady Lowe died in Hertford Street, Mayfair, Westminster, on 22 August 1832.<br>
<br>In mid-January 1816 Lowe left Portsmouth for St Helena, accompanied by his wife and her two daughters; they reached the island on 14 April. Two days earlier, a warrant had been issued, addressed to Lowe as &#145;lieutenant-general of his Majesty's army in St Helena and governor of that island&#146;, requiring him to detain and keep Napoleon as a prisoner of war, under such directions as should be issued from time to time by one of the principal secretaries of state. Indeed, frequent dispatches from Bathurst would reiterate Napoleon's status as a prisoner and the government's persistent fear that he might again escape captivity, as he had from Elba. Lowe, therefore, felt compelled to restrict Napoleon's freedom of movement. Nevertheless, he was not inhumane: shortly after his arrival, he raised the annual allowance for running Longwood, where Napoleon and his entourage lived, from &pound;8000 to &pound;12,000.<br>
<br>Lowe was unable, however, to establish a satisfactory relationship with Napoleon. Supposedly at their first meeting, when the governor addressed him as &#145;General Buonaparte&#146;, Napoleon observed: &#145;His eye is that of a hyena caught in a trap&#146;  (Rosebery, 66); and his dislike intensified, as Lowe insisted on still-tighter security. Lowe and Napoleon met six times in four months, then no more. The last two encounters were particularly acrimonious; though, by all accounts, Lowe maintained self-control in the face of considerable verbal abuse. After 18 August 1816 he refused to make further visits to Longwood, though a contrary version holds that Napoleon declined to see Lowe again because &#145;he makes me too angry and I lose my dignity&#146;  (Markham, 235). He also told a nephew of the prime minister, Lord Liverpool, that Lowe &#145;was one of the few men that your uncle should never have sent here&#146;, due to his association with &#145;the Corsican battalion&#146;, which Napoleon considered a collection of renegades and deserters  (ibid., 233). Indeed, views similar to Napoleon's were independently expressed. Wellington thought Lowe &#145;a very bad choice &hellip; wanting in education and judgement &hellip; a stupid man &hellip; [who] was suspicious and jealous&#146;  (Rosebery, 69). Count Balmain (who later married Lowe's stepdaughter) declared him &#145;not a tyrant, but he is troublesome and unreasonable beyond endurance&#146;  (ibid.). Officers who were on the spot all the time, and were personal friends of various members of Napoleon's staff, pointed to the real origin of many calumnies that have found general acceptance. Walter Henry, assistant surgeon in the 66th foot, which formed part of the St Helena garrison from 1816 to 1821, became convinced that Lowe's vigilance and his firmness in suppressing plots at Longwood were the cause of the hostility towards him, rather than any want of temper or courtesy. Lieutenant Basil Jackson, a Royal Staff Corps officer at St Helena, after noting reliance placed by the exiles on party sympathy in England, concluded:<blockquote>The policy of Longwood&#151;heartily and assiduously carried out by Napoleon's adherents, who liked banishment as little as the great man himself&#151;was to pour into England pamphlets and letters complaining of unnecessary restrictions, insults from the governor, scarcity of provisions, miserable accommodation, insalubrity of climate, and a host of other grievances, but chiefly levelled at the governor as the head and front of all that was amiss. (Jackson, 104)</blockquote>Napoleon died on 5 May 1821. At the end of July Lowe handed over the governorship to Brigadier-General John Pine Coffin and left St Helena. Peace was made, at the dying wish of Napoleon, between the exiles and the governor before the general exodus. At his departure, the people of the island presented Lowe with an address praising his rule. The confidence felt in him was evinced by the unanimous acceptance of his measures for the abolition of slavery (without compensation), which took effect from Christmas day 1818. The abolition of slavery was also warmly acknowledged by Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton in the House of Commons in May 1823.<h2>
<a name="Controversyandlastyears18211844"></a>Controversy and last years, 1821&#150;1844</h2>Back in England, Lowe was cordially received by George IV; and on 4 June 1822, he was appointed colonel of the 93rd foot (Sutherland Highlanders).<br>
<br>In August 1822 Barry Edward O'Meara, who had been Napoleon's doctor at St Helena, and who had resigned complaining of restraints placed on him by the governor, had been ordered off the island in July 1818, and on 2 November 1818 had seen his name removed from the navy list for defamatory allegations about Lowe, published in London his highly critical <span class="italic">Napoleon in Exile: a Voice from St. Helena</span>. The glaring inconsistencies between some of its statements and others previously made by O'Meara were exposed in the October 1822 issue of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>; nevertheless, the book went through five editions in a few months. Lowe sought legal redress, and a rule <i>nisi</i> for a criminal information against O'Meara was obtained in Hilary term 1823 but was afterwards discharged on a technical objection in respect of time. Lowe was then advised that he had done everything necessary by denying the various charges on affidavit, as O'Meara, if he challenged the truth of the denials, could proceed against him for perjury. He was, therefore, dissuaded from further proceedings against O'Meara, though he was strongly advised by Lord Bathurst to publish a full and complete vindication of his governorship of St Helena from the materials in his possession. He appears, however, to have thought that the government was bound to defend his character as a public servant, whose conduct it had approved.<br>
<br>In 1823 Lowe was appointed governor of Antigua but quickly resigned for domestic reasons. He was then appointed to the staff in Ceylon as second in command under Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Barnes. He left his family in Paris and late in 1825 set out for Ceylon, where he remained until 1828, at which time implied criticisms in the last volume of Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Life of Napoleon</span> brought him home on leave. He met with a hearty welcome at St Helena on the way, but his return was not well received in official quarters because the reasons for it were deemed inadequate. Appeals to Bathurst and also to Wellington, who advised him to go back to Ceylon and look forward to succeed to the chief command, proved fruitless. His promotion to lieutenant-general on 22 July 1830 virtually coincided with the opposition party coming to power. Ceylon received a new governor, and Lowe's hopes of further preferment or pension were never fulfilled. He returned to England in 1831 and from that time until his death in 1844 incessantly pressed the government in respect of his claims. Letter after fastidious letter went to the Colonial Office, year by year, without result. He became colonel of the 56th foot on 22 July 1832, and then, on 17 November 1842, of his old regiment, the 50th. In 1842 also, he advanced to the highest class of the Prussian order of the Red Eagle, which was notified in a highly flattering letter from Baron von B&uuml;low recalling his &#145;signal services to the common cause in the glorious campaigns of 1813&#150;14&#146;. Previously, in 1838, he had been made a GCMG.<br>
<br>Lowe was a slightly built man of below average height. He had reddish hair, bushy eyebrows, a ruddy freckled face, an aquiline nose, and a tight mouth. His manner was quick and restless, though he was never a fluent speaker.<br>
<br>On leaving St Helena, Lowe possessed &pound;20,000 and much valuable property, including a fine and extensive library. However, before his death the heavy expenses in which he had been involved made him a much poorer man. He died at Charlotte Cottage, near Sloane Street, Chelsea, London, of paralysis on 10 January 1844, aged seventy-four.<br>
<br>Lowe's papers were entrusted to Sir Harris Nicolas to prepare for publication, but the arrangement was abandoned after many delays. Subsequently, they were placed by the publisher of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> in the hands of William Forsyth, who compiled the <span class="italic">Captivity of Napoleon at St Helena, from the Letters and Journals of Sir Hudson Lowe</span> (3 vols., 1853).<br>
