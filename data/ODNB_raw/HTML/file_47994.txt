<span class="headword">Leigh,  Alexander</span>  (<em>c.</em>1683&#150;1772), <span class="occ">local government officer and industrial promoter</span>, was born at Millgate, Wigan, but little else is known about his origins. During his lifetime his home town of Wigan was transformed from an archaic borough dominated by craft companies and disputes over burghal rights, office holding, and parliamentary elections, to the archetype of Dickens's Coketown. As a prominent agent of the change, Leigh founded a large fortune and a notable lineage.<br>
<br>From about 1710 to 1760 Leigh dominated the borough administration of Wigan: he held many of the key offices, serving as mayor (1727, 1737, and 1759), bencher (1726, 1741, 1760&#150;62, and 1765), town clerk (1733&#150;6), town attorney (1743&#150;53), and town justice (1760). During these fifty years he also managed the parliamentary electorate of Wigan in association with Robert Holt, Holt's son Edward, and his own son Robert. First to benefit from the often violent chicanery of &#145;their high and mightinesses Leigh and Holt&#146;  (NL Scot., Crawford MS 47/2) was James Barry, earl of Barrymore, who was MP for Wigan (1715&#150;47), and also its mayor (1725 and 1734). Although Leigh initially acted against the interest of Sir Roger Bradshaigh, third baronet (1675&#150;1747), who also represented Wigan in parliament (1695&#150;1747) and served as mayor, he and the Holts subsequently became close associates of the Bradshaighs. In an acrimonious dispute in 1759&#150;60 Leigh set up, as senior alderman, an alternative borough administration, of which he made himself mayor. By 1761 he had lost control of Wigan, and &#145;Corporation feuds &hellip; moderated into peace; for the Electors, doubtless, have discovered that beating out of brains did not contribute to the honesty or worth of the elected&#146;  (Walker, 34).<br>
<br>Leigh married his first wife, Elizabeth, before 1709, and they had seven children between 1709 and 1718. Four died in infancy, and a fifth at the age of twenty-one. Their son Robert (1713&#150;1741) also practised as an attorney and was active in Wigan politics until his early death. In addition Leigh had an illegitimate son (who died in 1725) with Mary Tootell. On 22 July 1728 Leigh married Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1705), daughter of Robert Holt; they had seven children between 1729 and 1737.<br>
<br>As the agent or trustee of many local landowners and steward of seventeen manor courts, Leigh was experienced in proving and exchanging manorial titles, and therefore common and mineral rights. Oversight of the local affairs of the Bradshaighs, who spent most of their time at court in London, gave Leigh considerable expertise in estate and colliery management. In 1737 and 1738 he kept Bradshaigh minutely informed about a fire in his Haigh colliery (yet without mentioning that six colliers were killed in the disaster). He bought Hindley Hall estate from the Hindley family, and in 1721 he obtained an act to enclose Hindley commons; this was steered through parliament by Bradshaigh and Barrymore, against strong local opposition. By about 1750 Leigh also had land in Manchester (developed as Cannon Street), Wigan (including Whitely Hall), Orrell, and Ince. Leigh's estates contained rich coal deposits as did land acquired next to his own in Orrell on the marriages in 1762 and 1760 of his sons Holt (1731&#150;1785) and Edward (<i>b</i>. 1733) to two wealthy sisters of a neighbouring family. By 1770 the Leigh family owned 4 million tons of high-grade coal in Orrell; and reserves in Hindley, Ince, and Aspull, though not as well located relative to waterways until after Alexander's death, were even bigger.<br>
<br>Mining developed rapidly after the River Douglas was made navigable from Wigan to the Ribble estuary. Contractors appointed in 1720 did not do the work, and the parliamentary commissioners for the project (including Barrymore) appointed Alexander Leigh and Alexander Radcliffe of Ormskirk to complete it in 1731. Leigh took over five-sixths of the enterprise and Robert Holt one-sixth in 1737. Although the commissioners declared the navigation finished in 1742 within the stipulated eleven years, the first receipts were earned in 1744, and the business did not move into consistent profit until 1753. At this point Leigh announced that annual dividends would be paid, and he sold two shares of one thirty-sixth each. The total cost of the waterway was over &pound;23,000; however, receipts from tolls on coal shipments grew nearly ninefold between 1748 and 1754, and annual profits between 1753 and 1755 averaged nearly &pound;200 and were climbing steeply. Leigh operated collieries on the river, traded coal to the Ribble estuary and the Lancashire coast, and made money from rents on coal yards, way-leaves, and coal royalties. Threats to impose sea-borne coal duties on boats crossing estuarine and coastal waters were fought off in parliament by Barrymore and Bradshaigh.<br>
<br>A few weeks before his death, Leigh sold his twenty-nine of the thirty-six navigation shares for &pound;14,500 to the proprietors of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, who thereby gained control of waterway access to the Wigan coalfield. Holt Leigh had already sold the two shares he had received from Edward Holt to the canal company for &pound;2000 in 1768, days after a cancelled agreement for the transfer of all of his father's shares to him in return for settling debts of only &pound;6335. The Orrell and Wigan estates were not bequeathed in Alexander's will, and must have been transferred before his death to Holt Leigh.<br>
<br>Alexander Leigh's powers were perhaps failing as he moved into his late eighties, though he granted mortgages in the last year of his life and the will drawn up within weeks of his death was signed with the usual bold flourishes in a firm hand. Judged on his behaviour in Wigan affairs, Leigh was domineering and cantankerous. In his later years it seems that he continued to be unscrupulous: in his quarrels with and threats against Sir Roger Bradshaigh and Edward Holt, in the chancery suit he began in 1755 against the other beneficiaries of Robert Holt's will of 1740, in the sour tone of his bequest to his wife, in his contractual dealings with his son Holt, and in his sale agreement with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company (it excluded the land necessary to run the navigation, which was obtained by returning a share). When he died at his lifelong home in Millgate, Wigan, in 1772, the only surviving members of his family were his widowed granddaughter of his first marriage, Cicely Harvey, to whom he bequeathed &pound;3000, his sons Holt and Edward from his second marriage, and his second wife. He was buried at All Saints, Wigan, on 27 November 1772. Holt Leigh was Alexander's elder surviving son and principal heir; like his father he was an attorney and had considerable business acumen, and he amassed more land and coal rights (including the marriage portion and paternal inheritance of his only surviving brother, Edward). He also rebuilt Whitely Hall as Leigh Place in the five years after his father's death. Despite the &#145;folly and profligacy&#146; of his unmarried &#145;mature years&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Lancaster</span>, 4.120), Holt Leigh's son and heir, Sir Robert Holt Leigh, first baronet, of Hindley Hall (1763&#150;1843) was MP for Wigan between 1802 and 1820. He left an income of over &pound;14,000 a year for life to a distant kinsman, Thomas Pemberton, who took the name Pemberton Leigh in 1842.<br>
