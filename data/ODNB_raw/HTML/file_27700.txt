<span class="headword">Trench <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Chenevix; <em>other married name </em>St George]</span>,  Melesina</span>  (1768&#150;1827), <span class="occ">diarist and letter-writer</span>, was born in Dublin on 22 March 1768, the daughter of Philip Chenevix and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Archdeacon Gervais; she was the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5216/', "Richard Chenevix (1696/7&#150;1779)")</script>, bishop of Waterford, who owed his see to the patronage of Lord Chesterfield, lord lieutenant of Ireland from 1745 to 1746. After the death of her parents Melesina was brought up by her grandfather Bishop Chenevix and her relative Lady Lifford. After the bishop's death in 1779, she went to live with her maternal grandfather, Archdeacon Gervais, through whose library she rambled at large, and from which, with precocious taste and intelligence, she selected as her favourites Shakespeare, Moli&egrave;re, and Sterne. She developed great personal beauty, and on 31 October 1786 she married Colonel Richard St George of Carrick-on-Shannon and Hatley Manor, co. Leitrim; they had one child before his death in Portugal only two years after the marriage.<br>
<br>For ten years Melesina St George lived in seclusion with her child, and it is not until 1798 that her interesting journal commences. During 1799 and 1800 she travelled in Germany, mixing in the very best society, and noting many items of historical interest. From Berlin and Dresden she proceeded to Vienna, and at Dresden, on her return journey, she met Nelson and Lady Hamilton, of whose lack of refinement some unpleasant instances are afforded. In Germany she also met Rivarol, Lucien Bonaparte, and John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States. An account of this tour was privately issued by her son, Richard, in 1861; it was then incorporated in the <span class="italic">Remains</span> of 1862.<br>
<br>In July 1802, after a short stay in England, Melesina St George landed from Dover at Calais, on what proved a five years' sojourn in France; she also began exchanging letters with Mary Leadbeater in 1802. In Paris on 3 March 1803 she married Richard Trench (1774&#150;1860), the sixth son of Frederick Trench of Moate, co. Galway. Her husband's eldest brother, Frederic, was created Lord Ashtown in 1800. From his ancestor, Frederick Trench (<i>d</i>. 1669) of Garbally, co. Galway, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27703/', "Richard Le Poer Trench, second earl of Clancarty (1767&#150;1837)")</script>, also descended. Both Chenevixes and Trenches were of Huguenot origin.<br>
<br>After this time Melesina Trench's journal writing gave way to a charming correspondence with her husband and her old friends in England and Ireland. After the rupture of the peace of Amiens her husband was detained in France by Napoleon, and was confined to the Loire district. She made repeated visits to Paris to urge his release, and in August 1805 she delivered in person a petition to Napoleon for a passport for her husband; but it was not until 1807 that the requisite document was obtained and they were enabled to make their way to Rotterdam, whence, after a stormy passage, they reached England.<br>
<br>At Dublin, in November, Melesina met her old friend and correspondent, Mary Leadbeater, whom she had employed as almoner among her husband's tenants in Ireland. During a summer visit to the Leadbeaters it is related how she was discovered in the scullery surrounded by a small class of peasant children. The same charm made her much sought after in society, but the frivolities of a &#145;modish&#146; life became more and more repugnant to her; and her letters become more personal and introspective, lacking external facts and detail. There are, however, some interesting touches respecting Wellington, Jekyll, Hester Piozzi (Mrs Thrale), Mrs Fry, and Lord John Russell, but the references to the political society with which she mixed at Paris under the first empire are tantalizingly brief. No mean judge, Edward Fitzgerald, to whom her son, Richard, submitted her letters and papers in manuscript, classes her letters with those of Walpole and Southey, praising them especially for their &#145;natural taste and good breeding&#146;  (letter dated 3 July 1861).<br>
<br>Apart from the <span class="italic">Remains</span>, including the journal and correspondence, of which two editions appeared in 1862 under the editorship of Richard Chenevix Trench, then dean of Westminster, Melesina Trench's writings comprise: <span class="italic">Mary Queen of Scots, an Historical Ballad, and other Poems</span> (n.d., privately issued), <span class="italic">Campaspe, an Historical Tale, and other Poems</span> (1815), and <span class="italic">Laura's Dream, or, The Moonlanders</span> (1816). All these were issued anonymously, and show the influence of Byron, Rogers, and especially Thomson, whose <span class="italic">Seasons</span> she greatly admired. Her <span class="italic">Thoughts of a Parent on Education, by the Late Mrs Richard Trench</span> (1837) appeared posthumously.<br>
<br>Melesina Trench died at Malvern on 27 May 1827. Her husband survived her many years, dying at Botley Hill, Hampshire, aged eighty-six on 16 April 1860. At that date three of their nine children were still alive: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27697/', "Francis Chenevix Trench (1805&#150;1886)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27702/', "Richard Chenevix Trench (1807&#150;1886)")</script>, afterwards archbishop of Dublin, and Philip Charles (1810&#150;1888) of Botley.<br>
