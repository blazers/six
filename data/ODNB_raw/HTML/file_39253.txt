<span class="headword">Altounyan,  Roger Edward Collingwood</span>  (1922&#150;1987), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 24 October 1922 at Aleppo, Syria, the only son and fourth of the five children of Ernest Haig Riddell Altounyan (1889&#150;1962), surgeon, and his wife, Dora Susie (1886&#150;1964), artist and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39918/', "William Gershom Collingwood (1854&#150;1932)")</script>, poet and secretary of John Ruskin, of Lanehead, Coniston. Ernest Altounyan had been educated at Rugby School, Cambridge University, and the Middlesex Hospital, London. Having qualified in 1915, he married and then served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in France, where he was severely wounded and won the Military Cross. After the war he and his wife went to the Altounyan Hospital, Aleppo, which had been founded by his Armenian father, Assadour Aram Altounyan. About 1955 Ernest Altounyan's fortunes changed; the hospital and his other property were confiscated and he was turned out of Syria. The family returned to Britain and subsisted on a small property in the Lake District inherited through Dora's family.<br>
<br>Roger Altounyan's childhood was spent at Aleppo and at Lanehead, where Arthur Ransome, a family friend and neighbour, taught the children to sail their dinghy <i>Swallow</i> on Lake Coniston. When Ransome later wrote his book <span class="italic">Swallows and Amazons</span>, Roger and his sisters were the originals for the characters of the Walker family. Ransome dedicated the first edition to them, though he later disclaimed the connection.<br>
<br>Altounyan was educated at Abbotsholme School, Derbyshire, where his severe eczema made his life difficult and often unhappy. In 1941 he joined the RAF, where his ability as an instructor of bomber pilots was exceptional. He was appointed to the staff of a flying instructors' school in 1943 and was awarded the Air Force Cross for the dangerous work of developing low-level night-flying techniques.<br>
<br>After the war Altounyan read medicine at Cambridge and the Middlesex Hospital, where he first developed the asthma which was to trouble him for the rest of his life. On 8 September 1951 he married Hella-Christel Schumacher (<i>b</i>. 1925); they had five children. Altounyan qualified in August 1952 and went to Aleppo to help his father, but in 1955 the political situation created increasing difficulties and he returned to the UK. In 1956 he obtained a post with Bengers, a small pharmaceutical company, at Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, which was developing compounds to relax bronchial smooth muscle and help asthmatic subjects. New compounds were being tested in sensitized guinea pigs for their ability to relax contracted smooth muscle induced by allergic reactions. Altounyan noted that one otherwise inactive compound significantly diminished this allergic reaction, and saw its potential for the treatment of human asthma.<br>
<br>Because reactions in guinea pigs are clearly different from those in humans, studies on human asthma were essential. Altounyan therefore began careful studies on himself to see whether prior inhalation of the experimental compounds would prevent the development of attacks of asthma that he could induce by inhaling extracts of guinea-pig hair. Over the next seven years he gave himself more than 600 attacks, each lasting between two and three hours. The studies were done at Monsall Hospital, Manchester, where he also saw patients in his thrice-weekly outpatient clinics.<br>
<br>Although Altounyan eventually obtained encouraging results, these were only in himself, not in the guinea pigs. An independent expert's opinion did not support him, and the project was closed down in 1961. But Altounyan persuaded his colleagues to continue, initially in secret until, in January 1965, they synthesized the highly active disodium cromoglycate with the required properties. A small clinical trial in severe asthmatics using an ingenious inhalation device invented by Altounyan gave such encouraging results that a pilot production plant was commissioned. But three further trials by acknowledged asthma experts were not supportive and it was feared that Altounyan had produced a monumental commercial failure. Fortunately, senior management saw for themselves the undoubted benefit in a group of patients and had no further doubts. The drug was eventually marketed worldwide as Intal&#151;interferes with allergy&#151;a major new treatment for asthma. Over the next twenty years, ignoring advice, Altounyan continued testing further new drugs on himself even though he was increasingly disabled with breathlessness, and eventually required continuous oxygen therapy.<br>
<br>Altounyan lectured widely on asthma, with clarity and wit, and was admired and respected by colleagues throughout the world. His original and meticulous investigation of patients, which ahead of prevailing practice included provocation tests for bronchial hyper-reactivity, gave him an unsurpassed understanding of the nature and treatment of airways disease, as set out in his publication in <span class="italic">Thorax</span> in 1964. For his outstanding work Altounyan was elected FRCP in 1982, and he received an honorary doctorate of Southampton University. His major contributions to medicine, benefiting countless asthmatics, were made at great personal cost, and many felt that he did not receive adequate recognition.<br>
<br>Although blessed with an exceptionally clear and original mind, and possessing the leadership qualities so necessary for success, Altounyan had no personal ambition. His intellectual honesty was absolute so that at times he could be embarrassingly frank. He loved entertaining with Middle Eastern cuisine and copious amounts of home-made wine. He was an enthusiast who enjoyed life, but never more than when sailing <i>Amazon</i> on his beloved Lake Coniston. He died at his home, 2 Stanneylands Road, Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 10 December 1987, and was buried at Wilmslow parish church four days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
