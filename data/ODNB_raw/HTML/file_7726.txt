<span class="headword">Docwra, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1527), <span class="occ">prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England and diplomat</span>, was descended from the Westmorland family of Docwra of Docwra Hall, Kendal, belonging to a cadet branch which had settled in Hertfordshire. His father, Richard Docwra, had married Alice, daughter of Thomas Green of Gressingham, Lancashire. Nothing certain is known of Thomas Docwra's education or early life, except that at some point he joined the order of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem. Claims that he took part in the successful defence of Rhodes against the Turks in 1480 cannot be confirmed, but he clearly enjoyed a successful career in the order. In October 1494 he was elected prior of Ireland, but resigned on 4 January 1495, when he was elected turcopolier; later that year he was made captain of the order's galleys. On 6 August 1501, still on Rhodes, he was elected grand prior of the hospital of England, following the death of John Kendall, and returned home. He remained head of the order in England until his death, carrying out substantial works at its principal house at Clerkenwell, where he had built its gatehouse by 1506. But he did not sever all links with Rhodes. He returned there in 1503, and further efforts to recall him to the island were made in 1510 and 1515, while in 1521 he only just failed to be elected grand master of the hospital. Perhaps his English preoccupations were held against him.<br>
<br>In 1506 Docwra had entered the king's service as one of the envoys used by Henry VII to negotiate with Philip of Castile. Philip's ships had been driven by storm onto the English coast, and his enforced stay in England was put to some use. An economic and trade treaty with the Netherlands was negotiated by Docwra and other English commissioners with representatives of the Dutch merchants. Docwra's success here led to his appointment to negotiate Henry VII's proposed marriage to Philip's sister, Margaret of Savoy, and he soon became an indispensable diplomatic journeyman. In September 1507 he was one of a body of commissioners sent to Calais on a peace embassy, their purpose being to settle the terms of an alliance with Philip and a treaty for the marriage of Charles, prince of Castile (later the emperor Charles V) with the Princess Mary. Although Philip died on 25 September, these treaties were successfully concluded on 21 December.<br>
<br>Docwra's career did not suffer as a result of the accession of Henry VIII, and he continued to be employed as a diplomat. Between 29 May and 23 July 1510 he and Nicholas West (later bishop of Ely) were dispatched as ambassadors to France in order to receive from Louis XII a formal acknowledgement of the sums he owed to the English crown for arrears of tribute. At about the same time Docwra's services were requested by the grand master of the knights of St John at their headquarters in Rhodes, as a result of Turkish military manoeuvres, but Henry would not spare him. As prior of St John's, Docwra was also employed on a number of more mundane domestic commissions by the king. These included gaol deliveries for Newgate and a commission of inquiry into alleged extortion by masters of the mint, and he was also appointed to inspect both the sewers of Lincolnshire (hospitaller interests were involved here) and of the River Thames between Greenwich and Lambeth. Then, on 4 February 1512, he was nominated as an ambassador to the Lateran council, set to start on 19 April. But these orders were subsequently revoked, and instead Docwra became caught up in the war with France of 1512. On 2 May of that year he was appointed to review and report upon the troops which were to be sent to Spain, under the marquess of Dorset, for an Anglo-Spanish attack upon Aquitaine, and further to this, on 22 February 1513, he was summoned to be ready by April to attend the king with 300 men at his own expense. His forces were incorporated into the army, under the command of the earl of Shrewsbury, which crossed into Calais in May and into France on 6 June. His order's contribution to the effort is noteworthy&#151;it included a ship of &#145;two hundred tons burden&#146;, placed under the command of Lord Edmund Howard. Among the badges borne in the standards of the expedition was that of &#145;the lord of St John's&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Cleo. C.v, fol. 59).<br>
<br>When the fighting ceased in the autumn Docwra soon resumed his usual diplomatic duties. He was sent to France again in August 1514, with the earl of Worcester and Nicholas West, to obtain Louis XII's ratification of a peace treaty and to witness his marriage to the Princess Mary. The envoys remained there to witness her subsequent coronation at St Denis, on 5 November. In February 1515 Docwra attended parliament, the prior of the hospitallers being <i>ex officio</i> a peer of the realm. He was appointed a trier of petitions from Gascony, and the government clearly counted on his support against ecclesiastical attempts to prevent the renewal of the 1512 statute denying benefit of clergy to men in minor orders. But Docwra was equivocal on this issue, perhaps in consequence of his dual status as a churchman and an important baron, while he voted with the clergy on later bills relating to the <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> of Richard Hunne. On 10 March it was decided that he should be sent to Rome, along with John Fisher (bishop of Rochester), Sir Edward Poynings, and Dr John Taylor. But although very large sums of money had been devoted to this embassy (&pound;800 apiece to Fisher, Docwra, and Poynings and &pound;266 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. to Taylor), it was halted by Wolsey (as Polydore Vergil expected that it would be). Docwra is next recorded the following November, when he was among those present in Westminster Abbey when Wolsey received his cardinal's hat. Perhaps it was due to the king's, or Wolsey's, favour, that on 21 February 1516 he obtained for himself and the hospital there a licence to hold the prebend of Blewbury, Berkshire, in mortmain. In May 1516 he was recorded once again in a diplomatic context, attending on Scottish ambassadors and acting as interpreter in an interview between the Venetian ambassador and the duke of Suffolk.<br>
<br>It would seem that there were only short periods when Docwra was not engaged in diplomacy, and these tended to be times of emergency. In late April 1517, for instance, he was in Th&eacute;rouanne on a commission concerning trade, but was almost immediately back in London during the May day riots; with Thomas Howard, George Talbot, and George Neville he drove off the rowdy apprentices through a timely appearance at St Martin's parish. Their troops blocked the surrounding roads and many arrests were made. This was a brief interlude, however. In September 1518, when French ambassadors arrived in England, Docwra was one of the lords appointed to meet with them, and in the following month he was a member of the return embassy sent to France to take the oath of Fran&ccedil;ois I to the new treaty of alliance, by which he was to marry Princess Mary. The embassy crossed from Dover to Calais in twenty-six ships in November, and received Fran&ccedil;ois's oath at Notre Dame on 14 December following. Docwra was also one of the commissioners who returned Tournai to the French in February 1519, for a payment of 50,000 francs.<br>
<br>Another break in Docwra's usual diplomatic routine came about on 8 July 1519, when a search for suspicious characters was ordered for London and its suburbs, the districts in and about the city being parcelled out among different commissioners appointed to conduct it. As the prior of St John's, Docwra was made responsible for this investigation in Islington, Holloway, St John Street, Cowcross, Trille Mylle Street (Turnmill Street), and Charterhouse Lane, conducting it on Sunday night, 17 July, when two persons were apprehended in Islington and eleven in places nearer the city. Docwra's name also occurs about this time on a list of councillors appointed by Wolsey to sit at Whitehall and hear the causes of poor men who had suits in the Star Chamber. In 1520 he crossed with the king to the Field of Cloth of Gold, and accompanied Henry at his initial meeting with Fran&ccedil;ois I on 7 June. Later, he accompanied the king to Gravelines for his meeting with the emperor. In 1521 he was one of the peers who sat in judgment when the duke of Buckingham was condemned for treason.<br>
<br>Later that year Docwra resumed his diplomatic career. In August he went with Wolsey to Calais, where the cardinal sat as umpire between the French and the imperialists, and afterwards he was sent with Sir Thomas Boleyn to the emperor at Oudenarde. But their efforts to arrange a truce were unsuccessful, and they returned to England in November. In 1522 Docwra accompanied the king to meet Charles V again, on his visit to England between Dover and Calais and, shortly thereafter, he was appointed one of the commissioners for raising a forced loan in the county of Middlesex; this was a regular assessment upon property, in which Docwra himself was assessed at &pound;1000. In the parliament which convened in April of that year he was once again appointed a trier of petitions, while on 2 November 1523 he was appointed one of the commissioners for Middlesex to collect the subsidy granted in that same parliament. On 25 May 1524, following a commission from the king, he and the imperial ambassador, Louis De Praet, drew up a treaty for a joint invasion of France. Later, on 12 February 1525, he was again appointed to conduct a search for suspicious characters in the north of London. So much activity may well have been too much for him, as in early April 1527 it was reported that he had fallen ill, and he probably died within the month, in London, and was possibly buried at St John's, Clerkenwell.<br>
<br>Docwra appears to have owned property in Hertfordshire, on the evidence of a sculptured stone, preserved in buildings of a later date at Highdown, the old family seat near Hitchin, bearing the arms of his family with the inscription &#145;Thomas Docwra, miles, 1504&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Hertfordshire</span>, 3.46). This and his seal, appended to the receipt (preserved in the French archives) given to Fran&ccedil;ois I for the money agreed on in 1518 for the surrender of Tournai, is all that remains of him. The seal is in the form of a shield bearing the device of a lion issuant holding a pomegranate, with the initials T. D..<br>
