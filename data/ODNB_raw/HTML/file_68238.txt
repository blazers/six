<span class="headword">Weston,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>John Baptist]</span>  (1654/5&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar</span>, joined the English Recollect Franciscans in 1672, and was ordained a priest in 1679. He was a zealous missionary in England for many years and was appointed guardian of the Douai friary on two occasions. He participated in the consecration of the St Amand Chapel for the Eyston family at East Hendred, Berkshire, on 24 September 1687. The chapel was open to all comers until 11 December 1688, when it was raided by &#145;some loose fellows&#146;, but Weston, who happened to be in the district, said mass there again on Monday, 24 June 1689, and the chapel continued in use. He is described as a man who liked solitude and was a strict advocate of a well regulated religious mode of life, given to afflicting his body, and was called an example of true Franciscan humility to everyone. Father Thaddeus praised his description of evangelical poverty, stating that it was scarcely possible to describe it more clearly or accurately.<br>
<br>Weston's book, <span class="italic">An abstract of the doctrine of Jesus-Christ, or, The rule of the frier-minors: literally, morally, and spiritually expounded</span>, was published in 1718. In some copies it is followed by <span class="italic">A supplement to the abstract, being examples of holy men, drawn from the monuments of the order, and apply'd to each text of the rule</span>, which dates to 1726. In the preface he declared that his one intention was to promote the observance of the rule <i>ad litteram, sine glossa</i>, forgetting that his work was a very long gloss indeed and included the glosses of other writers. He used four earlier expositions of the rule by Antonio of Cordoba (1621), Bonaventure Dernoye (1657), Pierre Marchant (1669), and Gaudentius vanden Kerchove (1700). The dissection of the rule into so-called precepts and counsels was then well under way. He quoted abundantly from the Old and New Testaments, and used the <i>opuscula</i> and <i>legenda</i> of St Francis, together with the chronicle and the annals of the order. The book was popular, to judge from the number of extant copies in friaries.<br>
<br>In the <i>facultas</i> (permission) he is named as <i>custos custodum</i>. A Franciscan province, such as England, was made up of many guardianates, divided into a few custodies for administrative purposes, with a <i>custos</i> in charge of each; one was chosen to represent and to co-ordinate the work of the others, this post being the one held by Weston. He also wrote a commentary, perhaps unpublished, on the Barcelona general statutes of the order, presumably meaning those promulgated in 1621 by the minister general, Benignus of Genoa, rather than those promulgated by the general chapter in Barcelona in 1461. According to his obituary notice Weston died rather suddenly, if not unexpectedly, aged seventy-four, on 11 April 1729 at Douai, in the friary of the Friars Minor Recollects of England, and was buried in the north end of the cloister there.<br>
