<span class="headword">Ollyffe,  John</span>  (1647/8&#150;1717), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Arundel, Sussex. He and his brother Thomas were the sons of John Ollyffe (<i>d</i>. 1667), during the interregnum vicar of Ringmer and curate of Wivelsfield in Sussex, and an ejected minister at the Restoration. Having studied philosophy and logic at St Catharine's College, Cambridge (which he entered on 16 June 1665), Ollyffe migrated to Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated, aged twenty, on 7 February 1668. He proceeded BCL from New Inn Hall in 1672, and was ordained. He served the remainder of his life in two rectories: West Almer, Dorset (1673&#150;93), and Dunton, Buckinghamshire (1693&#150;1717).<br>
<br>Ollyffe was a reformer who worked through the established church to restore social order and morality. These efforts he directed mainly at his own parishioners: guiding them in practical matters, in <span class="italic">A Minister's Last Advice to his People</span> (1694); steering them clear of error, in <span class="italic">A Brief Defence of Infant-Baptism</span> (1694); and indoctrinating them, in <span class="italic">A Practical Exposition of the Church-Catechism</span> (1710). Ollyffe encouraged local societies in this effort, as in his <span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd &hellip; before the Society for Reformation of Manners</span> (1702). Politically outspoken, he preached before local assizes in 1709 and 1715 and published sermons supportive of such whig causes as the allegiance to limited, constitutional monarchy (<span class="italic">England's Call to Thankfulness</span>, 1689), which, to many high-churchmen's dismay, he reiterated at the accession of George I (<span class="italic">An Exhortation to Faithful and True Allegiance</span>, 1715). His concept of order included protestant solidarity against popery, beginning with his oft repeated plan for readmitting moderate dissenters to the church (<span class="italic">An Essay towards a Comprehension</span>, 1701; 3rd edn, 1718). Just as Ollyffe asserted &#145;I am no Dissenter, but I love and honour Dissenters that are good Men&#146;, he equally disdained shallow formalism and bigotry in his own church  (Ollyffe, preface).<br>
<br>Ollyffe earned a reputation as a polemicist with his <span class="italic">Defence of Ministerial Conformity</span> (1702&#150;5) in which he challenged the claim of Edmund Calamy, made in his <span class="italic">Abridgement of Mr Baxter's History of his Life</span> and expanded upon in debate with Ollyffe and Benjamin Hoadly in <span class="italic">A Defence of Moderate Non-Conformity</span> (1703&#150;6), that dissenting principles were still viable. But he managed this temperately, with genuine concern for restoring fellowship. Even Calamy admitted Ollyffe's approach was respectful and moderate, and that they were &#145;far from differing&#146; in their desire for reformation.<br>
<br>Ollyffe died at Dunton on 24 June 1717, leaving three sons in the ministry: John (1676&#150;1743), rector of Hedgerley (1699&#150;1743, and author of <span class="italic">A Sermon &hellip; upon Occasion of the Late Day of Thanksgiving for the Union</span> (170); George (<i>b</i>. 1682), vicar of Kemble in Wiltshire (and the only one of Ollyffe's sons' livings not in Buckinghamshire) in 1707 and of Wendover in 1715; and Thomas, vicar of Dunton and Eyworth (1712&#150;42) and rector of Denham (1742&#150;8).<br>
