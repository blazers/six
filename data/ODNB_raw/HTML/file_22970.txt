<span class="headword">Raban,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born in England, possibly in Worcestershire. He was in London in 1600, awaiting embarkation to the Low Countries to serve in the armies fighting against Spanish occupation. Remaining on the continent he was in Leiden about 1617&#150;19; there he learned to print, probably at the press of the Pilgrim Fathers. The details of his early life are gleaned from two of his publications, <span class="italic">Raban's Resolution Against Drunkennesse</span> and <span class="italic">The Popes New Years Gifts</span>, both 1622.<br>
<br>On his arrival in Edinburgh in 1620 Raban set up a printing press at the Cowgate Port, at the sign of the ABC. That same year he moved to St Andrews and took up residence in South Street, again at the sign of the ABC. Why Raban moved to Aberdeen in 1622 is unknown, though Robert Baron, professor of divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen, Bishop Patrick Forbes, and Sir Paul Menzies, provost, are said to have been instrumental in his travelling north. But given the presence of both King's and Marischal colleges in Aberdeen, and the educated groups associated with these institutions, the arrival of a printer can be seen as a natural development. Raban fulfilled the role of semi-official printer to the two colleges and to the town council but his enterprise was not limited to such work. Shortly after having arrived in Aberdeen he became associated with David Melvill, burgess and bookseller. Melvill initially paid the rent on the premises (in the Castlegate, at the sign of the Townes Armes) offered to Raban by the council. Many books (particularly grammars, almanacs, and editions of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>) printed by Raban between 1622 and 1633 carry Melvill's name on the imprint.<br>
<br>Some time before 1624 Raban married Janet Johnston, with whom he had at least one child, a daughter, baptized Constanzia. Janet died in 1627 and by 1637 Raban had married Janet Ailhous. In 1643 (the year of Melvill's death) Raban moved to accommodation in the Broadgate. Six years later he retired, and in 1650 he was succeeded by James Brown, son of the minister of Innernochty.<br>
<br>Over 150 publications (excluding jobbing printing) emanated from Raban's Aberdeen press. This output included graduation theses and some of the writings of the local professoriate, such as William Guild, principal of King's College, and Robert Baron, who was responsible, as one of the six Aberdeen doctors, for the <span class="italic">Generall Demands Concerning the Late Covenant</span> (1638). The instabilities of the times are further reflected in Raban's printing of <span class="italic">A Solemn League and Covenant</span> (1643) and <span class="italic">A Declaration of &hellip; James, Marquess of Montrose</span> (1644). His initiative as printer can be seen in his production in 1622 of <span class="italic">A New Prognostication</span>, which was brought out probably annually. Such was the work's success and reliability that it was subsequently ruthlessly pirated. And Raban's 1625 edition of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> is the first in Scotland to incorporate harmonized tunes. Raban died in Aberdeen in 1658 and was buried in the west wall of St Nicholas churchyard, Aberdeen, on 6 December.<br>
