<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  John</span>  (1769&#150;1839), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Leicester on 11 February 1769, the third son of James Vaughan MD of Leicester and his wife, Hester, daughter of John Smalley, alderman, also of Leicester. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28125/', "Charles Richard Vaughan")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11919/', "Sir Henry Halford")</script> were his brothers. Educated at Rugby School, he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 17 October 1785. Leaving Oxford without a degree, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 11 February 1786, and was called to the bar on 30 June 1791. Vaughan joined the midland circuit, where his style of advocacy brought him popularity with juries. Elected recorder of Leicester on 14 February 1798, he was created serjeant-at-law on 12 February 1799. A strong supporter of Pitt, he threw himself into the movement for raising funds for the war with France by public subscription.<br>
<br>On 20 December 1803 Vaughan married his first wife, Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1813), second daughter of Henry Beauchamp, thirteenth Baron St John of Bletso. They had six children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28132/', "Henry Halford Vaughan")</script>, another son, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Vaughan was appointed solicitor-general to Queen Charlotte on 1 May 1814, being promoted to attorney-general in the Trinity vacation 1816, and in the Easter term 1816 was appointed king's serjeant. As such in March 1820 he conducted the crown's case against Sir Francis Burdett for seditious libel following Burdett's comments upon the &#145;Peterloo massacre&#146; of 1819. In August 1821 Vaughan led for the crown in the prosecution for seditious conspiracy of George Edmonds and others who had resolved to elect a &#145;legislatorial attorney&#146; to represent Birmingham in parliament.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1823 Vaughan married his second wife, Louisa (1785&#150;1860), eldest daughter of Sir Charles William Rouse-Boughton, bt, and widow of St Andrew, fourteenth Baron St John of Bletso; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>On 23 February 1827 Vaughan was raised to the exchequer bench following the resignation of Sir Robert Graham and was knighted on 24 November 1828. His reputation for legal learning was not high, and it was said that he owed his judicial appointment to the influence of his brother Sir Henry Halford, though he was credited with a sound understanding both of court practice and of human character. He was one of the judges to whom was referred in 1829 the Irish case of <i>Harding v. Pollock</i>, on the question of whether the right of appointing clerks of the peace for a county was vested in the crown or in the <i>custos rotulorum</i> of the county, his opinion being given against the crown.<br>
<br>On 29 April 1834 Vaughan was transferred to the court of common pleas, and in June of the same year was sworn of the privy council and admitted to the Oxford degree of DCL. Consulted in the Camoys peerage case in 1839 about the rules regulating the determination of abeyances of baronies, he concurred in the judgment of Chief Justice Tindal.<br>
<br>Vaughan died of heart disease on 25 September 1839 at his home, Eastbury Lodge, near Watford, Hertfordshire, and was buried in the burial-ground of the parish of Wistow, Leicestershire. His brother Sir Henry Halford placed a mural tablet to his memory in Wistow church.<br>
