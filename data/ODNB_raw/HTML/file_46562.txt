<span class="headword">Verney <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Nightingale]</span>,  Frances Parthenope</span>, Lady Verney  (1819&#150;1890), <span class="occ">genealogist and author</span>, was born on 19 April 1819 at Naples, the first among the two children of William Edward Nightingale, formerly Shore (1794&#150;1874), and his wife, Frances (Fanny), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1789&#150;1880). She and her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35241/', "Florence Nightingale")</script>, were given names after their birthplace, Parthenope being the Greek form of Naples.<br>
<br>After their three-year tour in Italy the Nightingales returned to Britain in 1821 and lived at Lea Hurst, Derbyshire, but from 1825 wintered at Embley Park, near Romsey, Hampshire, with visits to London. Parthe (also known as Pop) and Flo enjoyed visits from numerous cousins and distinguished guests, but Parthe was usually eclipsed by her prettier, strong-willed sister. They were educated at home by governesses, but from 1832 their father taught them Greek, Latin, German, French, Italian, history, and philosophy. Parthe was less scholarly than Florence, and turned to her socialite mother, Fanny. Nevertheless, she was fluent in French, acquired a lasting love of literature, and developed artistic talents allied to close observation of fauna and flora, later expressed in <span class="italic">Sketches from Nature with Pen and Pencil</span> (1877). Like Florence she benefited from the family continental tour (September 1837&#150;spring 1839) and mingling in cultured circles in Italy and Paris.<br>
<br>To Florence's passionate friendships, rejected suitors, and alarming medical ambitions Parthe reacted with alternate submission and anger, adoration and jealousy. Later, like her mother, she was impressed by the official support for Florence's Crimean venture, and supported her work. On her return&#151;as a celebrity&#151;she guarded her sister's privacy. At Lea Hurst, Parthe was a devoted charitable visitor, closely observant of local life, stories, and dialect. Her latent talents blossomed when, on 24 June 1858, she married Florence's rejected suitor the handsome widower <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28231/', "Sir Harry Verney, formerly Calvert, second baronet (1801&#150;1894)")</script>, MP for Buckingham, supporter of liberal causes, and model landowner at Claydon House, Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire. She soon made Claydon a salon for people of talent, and conscientiously visited tenants. Her marriage also released her energies as an author, with a gift for fiction and for social comment.<br>
<br>Lady Verney's novels, mostly set in the 1820s, present love stories in traditional societies, with close rendering of working-class occupations and regional dialects. The first three, published anonymously, were <span class="italic">Avenhoe</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Stone Edge</span> (1868), a story of Derbyshire farmers involving a tragic death, and <span class="italic">Lettice Lisle</span> (1870), which deals with Hampshire yeomen and smuggling. <span class="italic">Fernyhurst Court</span> (1871), &#145;an everyday story&#146;, is a middle-class romantic comedy, while <span class="italic">Llanaly Reefs</span> (1873) deals with Welsh seamen. In <span class="italic">The Grey Pool and other Stories</span> (1891) the title story depicts the grim life of bargees and poachers, while <span class="italic">Hasty Feet Sorrow Meet</span> is a remarkably realistic study of a Welsh strike, in which miners, mine owner, and union leader are all sympathetically portrayed.<br>
<br>The diverse articles collected in <span class="italic">Essays and Tales</span> (1891) show the same imaginative and critical gifts: &#145;Lady Verney's essays on dreams, on female education in France, on the dignity of labor, and on the decline of honorable dealing among the English commercial classes are the work of a first-class mind&#146;  (Mackerness, 136). Several publications expressed her strong views on landownership, as in <span class="italic">Cottier Owners, Little Tales and Peasant Properties</span> (1885). Drawing from her continental travels, first-hand enquiries, and official documents, she argued that the system of peasant patrimony, leading to tiny, scattered holdings, produces a life of grinding toil, poor returns, and brutal poverty. English farming, with its modern methods and machinery, she presented as more efficient, with the wage-earning labourer enjoying a better diet and culture. She contrasted peasant/aristocrat enmity with the English scene, where the &#145;big house&#146; and park are &#145;the museum, entertainment ground and convalescent home of the neighbourhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cottier Owners</span>, 25). This thesis may be one-sided, but it reflected practice at Claydon, where large parties of schoolchildren came to spend a day in the park, and villagers gathered for tea, football, dancing, games, and fireworks. In these sociological tracts, which have in mind the problems of contemporary Ireland, she comes closest to her celebrated sister.<br>
<br>Lady Verney is best remembered, however, for her scholarly work at Claydon, seat of the Verneys for fourteen generations, where she &#145;threw herself into the congenial task of rescuing and renewing the interesting family relics which were falling into decay&#146;  (M. M. V., &#145;Memoir&#146;, xi). Portraits were restored and identified, furniture and carving installed, and gardens beautified. Above all she ordered the Verney family papers in the neglected long gallery, including letters (which amounted to no fewer than 30,000 up to the death of Sir Ralph in 1696), parchments, charters, account books, and rent rolls&#151;papers merely sampled by Bruce in his Camden Society articles of 1845 and 1853. Drawing on this copious material, she first wrote <span class="italic">The House of Claydon and its Inhabitants, from 1480 to 1769</span> (repr. in <span class="italic">Essays and Tales</span>, 15&#150;24). Then, contending with the painful arthritis which afflicted her in the 1880s, she completed volume 1 and drafted volume 2 of <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Verney Family during the Civil War</span> (1892). She was encouraged by the historian S. R. Gardiner, who wrote an introductory note for volume 1, and was helped by Sir Harry's daughter-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36644/', "Margaret Maria Verney")</script>, who continued the work. Parthenope delighted not only in the famous civil war heroes but also in &#145;the great stream of life of common people&#146;  (vol. 1, preface).<br>
<br>After a painful illness Lady Verney died on 12 May 1890 at Claydon House.<br>
