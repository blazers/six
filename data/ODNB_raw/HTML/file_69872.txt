<span class="headword">Samber,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1682, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1745), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was baptized on 20 April 1682 at Lymington, Hampshire, the son of Samuel Samber (<i>d</i>. 1716) of Lymington, surgeon, and Susannah Legg of Fawley. The Samber &#145;clan&#146; was affluent and influential (a number of seventeenth-century Sambers became mayors of Lymington). Given this social milieu it is rather surprising to find that Robert, unlike his elder brother Samuel, was brought up as a Roman Catholic (perhaps because of his mother's religion). While Samuel went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, Robert had to go abroad to acquire an education. On 11 July 1705 he entered the English College at Rome, presumably after spending some time at the English College at Douai&#151;he might be the Robert Samber who received a pass to visit Holland on 17 September 1703. He left again on 15 April 1706 without taking orders.<br>
<br>Back in England Samber started on a literary career by publishing a meditation in verse entitled <span class="italic">On the Passion of our Blessed Saviour</span> (1708). In the preface he talks about religious experiences during his stay at the English College at Rome and laments &#145;the new fashionable humour of squaring mysteries of Christianity by human reason&#146;. Very quickly life must have taught him that the only way to make a living by writing was to adapt to the taste of the time. Most prominent in his next extant publication, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Subjects</span> (1714), are imitations of Horace and epigrams in the true Augustan manner. Subsequently Samber engaged in all kinds of other literary activities that one associates with &#145;Grub Street&#146;. The range is extensive: from religious verse, medical handbooks, plays, books on architecture and economic history, devotional treatises, and pornography to wedding odes. He used his knowledge of Roman Catholic literature in adapting a popular tract of Jeremias Drexelius for the English market (<span class="italic">A Devout Christian's Hourly Companion</span>, 1716, and subsequent editions), cutting out all the too obviously Roman Catholic elements. He introduced England to two of the most advanced books on midwifery of his time (by Henry van Deventer).<br>
<br>As one of Edmund Curll's hack writers Samber translated Jean Barrin's <span class="italic">Venus dans le clo&icirc;tre, ou, La religieuse en chemise</span> (again using his inside knowledge of things Catholic) and thus became involved in the major obscenity case of the century: in 1725 Curll was accused of publishing obscene books among which was Samber's translation. After lengthy legal proceedings Curll was fined 25 marks for each offence in February 1728, but, Curll being Curll, <span class="italic">Venus in the Cloister</span> was again advertised in 1735. Samber instigated the publication of the correct text of Herman Boerhaave's <span class="italic">Methodus discendi medici</span> by publishing a garbled version; he was the adapter and translator of literary &#145;curiosities&#146;, such as Charles An&ccedil;illon's <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des eunuques</span>; and he was responsible for the English text of Charles Perrault's fairy tales which has never been out of print from 1729 to date. Many of his works, such as <span class="italic">The Courtier</span>, translated from the original by Castiglione, demonstrate that he was a very competent translator&#151;having French, Latin, and Italian&#151;and that he was highly interested in the problems posed by editing and translating. In the preface to <span class="italic">The Courtier</span> he shows an intimate knowledge of the English publishing history of Castiglione, and discusses past and present English versions. Samber has also recently been attributed with <span class="italic">The Touchstone</span> (1728), written by &#145;a person of some Taste and Quality&#146;. The work, often identified as by James Ralph, criticized the moral poverty of modern drama.<br>
<br>Samber's papers, preserved in the Bodleian Library, also give an impression of all the numerous projects that did not reach publication, such as a number of plays and translations of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span> and the homilies of Pope Clement XI. Among the papers are many draft letters to Samber's patrons (notably to John, duke of Montagu, and to members of the Catholic Howard dynasty) that give a unique insight into the day-to-day reality of the patronage system in the early eighteenth century. In order to ingratiate himself with Montagu Samber dedicated books to him, among them <span class="italic">Long Livers</span> (1722; a translation of a work by Harcouet de Longville); in the preface Samber presents himself as an eager proselyte to the fraternity of freemasons, of whom Montagu was grand master. Furthermore, among both his published and unpublished works there are &#145;poetic congratulations&#146; on births and weddings in the Montagu family and some of Samber's letters suggest that he was engaged by Montagu to act on his behalf in complicated legal issues. It is interesting to speculate why, in another pseudonymous publication (a translation, published in 1723 of <span class="italic">L'&eacute;loge de l'yvresse</span> by A. H. de Sallengre), Samber mercilessly ridicules the drinking habits of the fraternity of which his patron was a prominent member. Robert Samber died about 1745.<br>
