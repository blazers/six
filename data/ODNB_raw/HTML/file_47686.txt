</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Conway,  Moncure Daniel</span>  (1832&#150;1907), <span class="occ">social reformer and ethical preacher</span>, was born on 17 March 1832 at Middleton plantation, Stafford county, Virginia, the second of the six children of Walker Peyton Conway (1805&#150;1884), a slave-owning planter, attorney, and judge, and his wife, Margaret (1807&#150;1891), self-taught homoeopathic doctor, daughter of John Moncure Daniel, a United States army surgeon, and his wife, Margaret. His pious Methodist parents were both Virginia born, from distinguished Chesapeake families of English and (on his mother's side) French Huguenot descent. As a youth Conway knew he was expected to emulate his politically and socially prominent male relatives. He took seriously their values&#151;responsibility, honour, leadership, attention to duty&#151;and always admired these Virginians even after breaking with them decisively. The only home he had built for himself, in London's Bedford Park, he named Inglewood, after the Virginia home of his earliest memories.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Conway early displayed unusual predilections, more compatible with those of his female relatives. He loved music and literature, incurring a flogging by his Fredericksburg Academy instructor for absconding at midday to glimpse Charles Dickens during a brief visit in 1842. Compassionate, emotionally open, and convinced of the value of conciliation, he was more comfortable witnessing his mother soothe the sick than his father chastise criminals. His mother's vocal criticisms of slavery&#151;shared by other influential female relatives&#151;affected him profoundly.<br>
<br>After attending the Fredericksburg classical and mathematical academy (1841&#150;7) and receiving a BA in 1849 from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Conway briefly studied law, but abandoned it for the Methodist ministry, which he entered on his nineteenth birthday. This career proved short-lived. Disturbed by what he saw as a dogmatic repression of free thought, he resigned late in 1852; the following February, forfeiting his paternal inheritance, he entered Harvard Divinity School to train for the Unitarian ministry. While in Massachusetts he began a friendship with Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose writing had inspired him to assert his individuality and break with Methodism. At an anti-slavery rally near Boston on 4 July 1854 Conway's distance from his roots lengthened, as he declared himself an abolitionist and denounced Virginia's entanglement with slavery.<br>
<br>Soon after receiving his BD in July 1854 Conway gained the Unitarian pulpit in Washington, DC. He was dismissed in October 1856 for anti-slavery sermons, but immediately hired by Unitarians in Cincinnati, Ohio. When in 1858 he debunked <span class="roman">New Testament</span> miracles, one-third of his congregation defected. Conway compensated by attracting newcomers intrigued by his growing religious eclecticism and legitimation of spiritual uncertainty. In Cincinnati Conway began seriously studying Asian religions, and became known nationally as a vigorous exponent of liberal religion. His personal life became more settled after his marriage to Ellen Dana (1833&#150;1897), daughter of a Cincinnati businessman, on 1 June 1858. They would have three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Conway's ministerial career was interrupted by the American Civil War, which found his pro-Union mother and sister in the north, his father in the south, and his brothers in the Southern army. Conway supported the South's subjugation, but only if union were synonymous with emancipation: President Lincoln's slowness in effecting full emancipation depressed him, as did Virginia's ongoing ordeal. He coped by writing two anti-slavery books, <span class="italic">The Rejected Stone</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">The Golden Hour</span> (1862), and by co-editing a Boston anti-slavery newspaper, <span class="italic">The Commonwealth</span>, launched in September 1862. He was buoyed up temporarily by his August 1862 move from Cincinnati to Concord, Massachusetts, where he lived near Emerson and other congenial friends, and by his service that summer to thirty-three of his father's escaped slaves, whom he resettled in Ohio. But the war always tormented him. Finally, in April 1863 he escaped through expatriation, his pretext being an anti-slavery speaking tour in England. Shortly after arrival he sent for his family, never really expecting to return.<br>
<br>Conway had no plan when he began his European exile, but a remarkable stroke of timing rewarded his gamble. His first speech in England (6 May 1863) was at South Place Chapel, London's noted free-religious institution, at that moment reeling internally because of the unexpected orthodoxy of its minister. In August South Place hired Conway. It was a perfect match: the congregation applauded Conway's intellectual boldness, encouraging his attacks on sabbatarianism, sexual prudery, blasphemy laws, patriarchy, monarchy, and other apparent restraints on liberty, conscience, and expression. Led by Conway, South Place exceeded even its level of prestige during the long (1817&#150;53) ministry of W. J. Fox.<br>
<br>With full congregational support Conway substituted &#145;meditations&#146; for prayers in 1869 and ordinary seats for pews in 1872. He ceased to call himself minister; sermons became &#145;discourses&#146;. Beginning in 1873 he read from his own <span class="italic">Sacred Anthology</span>, a pioneering compilation of excerpts from the sacred books of the world's religions. In essence, Conway intellectually became agnostic, though he shunned the term, maintaining an emotional reverence for religious feeling, for the individual's critically minded but devoted quest for spiritual meaning and truth. Berated by the orthodox, Conway was credited by many spiritually restless individuals with salvaging their waning faith in religion's relevance. This ability to connect with thoughtful individuals, combined with his logic, learning, and graceful phraseology, compensated for his oratorical limitations and kept audiences entranced. A journalist who visited one Sunday in 1880 described Conway as &#145;the least orthodox preacher in London&#146;, whose words bore &#145;an oracular impress&#146;  (Davidson, 241&#150;2).<br>
<br>Conway published not only many South Place discourses but also a torrent of articles for both British and American periodicals: breezy travel pieces, gossipy accounts of celebrities, weighty ruminations on politics and religion. In 1870 he was a war correspondent in France for the New York <span class="italic">World</span> and the London <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. He was English agent for American writers, including Louisa May Alcott, Mark Twain, and Walt Whitman, writing a highly influential article on Whitman for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly</span> (15 October 1866). He developed as a scholar, though his scholarship remained partly polemical. Particularly noteworthy was <span class="italic">Demonology and Devil-Lore</span> (1879), a work of comparative mythology probing the origins of beliefs in demons and devils, now largely superseded but full of insight and lively speculation.<br>
<br>Conway's interest in comparative religion led him to India in 1883&#150;4, after speaking in Australia. He was disillusioned: he had known Hindu and Muslim intellectuals in London, but displays of popular religious fervour and uncritical &#145;superstition&#146; frightened and repelled him. He sailed to England with enthusiasm for his work shaken. This influenced his decision to return to America, as did his father's death in 1884 and his realization that his two younger children, born in London, had no attachment to the United States. Conway's affection for his native country had persisted along with his American accent. In 1885 the Conways settled in New York. Several books followed: two horrible novels, several works of history, and biography of widely varying quality. The best was an enduring two-volume biography of Thomas Paine (1892), followed by a skilfully edited four-volume collection of Paine's writings. Paine had fascinated Conway for forty years; life in London had cemented a sense of kinship with this earlier transatlantic radical.<br>
<br>After pleas to return Conway served again at South Place from 1893 to 1897, making his final mark on an institution that would survive through the twentieth century as the South Place Ethical Society, with headquarters after 1929 at Conway Hall (named after him), Red Lion Square. His wife's terminal illness prompted a final resignation; she died in New York on Christmas day 1897. Early in 1898 the Spanish-American War deepened Conway's darkening mood. He denounced this conflict and America's ensuing imperialist adventures. That summer, for the second time, war caused expatriation. He settled in Paris and began work on his memoirs. His <span class="italic">Autobiography, Memories and Experiences</span> (2 vols., 1904) was followed by <span class="italic">My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East</span> (1906), a mellowed account of his Indian sojourn coupled with additional reminiscence. Both were moving, humane reflections by a septuagenarian who had lived a stunningly varied and engaged life. Both reflected Conway's rejection of his long-standing faith in progress, and evidenced his renewed belief in the independent reality of evil. His autobiography stands as an enduring account of the nineteenth century, as well as an apt foreshadowing of the darker attitudes of the twentieth. Conway died at 5 rue Villedo, Paris, of natural causes on 15 November 1907, and was cremated in P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery.<br>
<br>Conway was tall and robust, idiosyncratically handsome when younger, resembling a weathered, white-bearded Jehovah in later life. His dread of intellectual submissiveness, born of boyhood pressures, manifested itself in a confrontational style that alienated some people, especially before and after his London years. But he was at bottom a warm, sociable man, who loved the theatre, good food and wine, billiards, cigars, and company, both male and female. An enthusiastic and knowledgeable art collector, he developed close and enduring friendships with key Pre-Raphaelites, becoming perhaps the closest thing to a spiritual adviser many in that Bohemian group would know. An ardent feminist, he was eulogist at the 1902 funeral of his friend the American woman's rights pioneer Elizabeth Cady Stanton. He also admired feminine beauty, unselfconsciously patronizing Parisian dance halls and revelling in the allure of Isadora Duncan. For much of his life he attracted young enthusiasts of both sexes, including the distinguished American photographer Edward Steichen, a fellow Paris expatriate who supervised Conway's cremation (his ashes were laid in Kensico cemetery in Valhalla, New York). But Conway encouraged not disciples but independent individuals who followed the motto inscribed on a wall at South Place: &#145;To Thine Own Self Be True&#146;. They were, as he often told them, and repeated in his memoirs, &#145;Those who think at all think freely&#146;  (Conway, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 2.445).<br>
