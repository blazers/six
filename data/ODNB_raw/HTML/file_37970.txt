<span class="headword">Sisson,  Jonathan</span>  (1690?&#150;1747), <span class="occ">maker of mathematical instruments</span>, was born in Lincolnshire, perhaps in 1690. He went from there to London and was established in a workshop on the corner of Beaufort Buildings in the Strand by 1722, probably having worked for George Graham, with whom he remained on very close terms. In 1725 he was employed by Graham to construct the framework of the 8 foot mural quadrant for Edmond Halley at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. He was appointed mathematical instrument maker to Frederick, prince of Wales, in April 1729, by which time he had a high reputation, particularly as a maker of surveying instruments, being known especially for his accurate division of scales. He manufactured the wooden quadrants invented by John Elton in 1730 and had a considerable number of these in stock at his death. Edward Saul, in <span class="italic">An Historical and Philosophical Account of the Barometer or Weather-Glass</span> (1735) wrote: <blockquote>it may perhaps be an Inducement to some of the Gentlemen of Lincolnshire, to deal with Mr Jonathan Sisson &hellip;; that he is their Country Man, and eminent for his great Skill, Accuracy and Fidelity, both in the Construction of his Barometers, and in whatever Work, he undertakes, or delivers out of his Hands.</blockquote>It was to Sisson that John Hadley turned when he required a copy of his newly invented reflecting octant to be made in brass for the 1731 Admiralty trial in the Thames estuary in the yacht <i>Chatham</i>. In 1736 Sisson was commissioned by Graham to construct a 9 foot zenith sector (the arc of which Graham divided himself) for the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences expedition to northern Sweden under Pierre de Maupertuis to measure the length of a degree of the meridian. Also in 1736 Graham commissioned him to prepare brass rods and scales for the Royal Society and the Acad&eacute;mie to show the relation between the English yard and the French half-toise. After each rod had been engraved with both yard and half-toise, and comparisons had been made in London and Paris, in 1742 Sisson divided each measure into three equal parts. The same year, a paper giving an account of a new spirit level invented and made by him was read at the Royal Society.<br>
<br>By this time Sisson's reputation was such that he had begun to receive orders for large astronomical instruments, such as mural quadrants, zenith sectors, and transit instruments for observatories all over Europe: for Utrecht, Bologna, Leiden, Paris, and Pisa, as well as for the private observatory of George Parker, second earl of Macclesfield at Shirburn. Jonathan's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37969/', "Jeremiah Sisson")</script> was working for his father at this time and about 1740 John Bird also worked for Sisson before setting up his own workshop near by in 1745. Jonathan Sisson was one of the most celebrated instrument makers of his time, fostering the high reputation which the London instrument-making trade acquired in Europe during the eighteenth century, ably followed by John Bird, Jeremiah Sisson, John and Peter Dollond, Jesse Ramsden, and Edward Troughton. Sisson died in London on 13 June 1747.<br>
