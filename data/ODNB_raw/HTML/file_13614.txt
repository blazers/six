<span class="headword">Holt,  Thomas</span>  (1577/8&#150;1624), <span class="occ">carpenter</span>, was born in Yorkshire. He was one of the group of northern craftsmen, including the Halifax masons John Akroyd and John Bentley, who were invited to Oxford by Sir Henry Savile, warden of Merton College, at a time when the university was in dispute with the city building crafts, and who undertook some of the most prestigious projects of the first two decades of the seventeenth century. Despite the assumption that he came from Halifax, Holt's birthplace in Yorkshire is unknown and it is likely that he first became associated with Akroyd during building work in the 1590s at either Methley Hall or Howley Hall, Yorkshire, both of which were owned by the Savile family. In May 1609 he was appointed master carpenter for the Fellows Quadrangle at Merton, where Akroyd and Bentley were already engaged on the masonry. Building was completed in 1610 and later that year the team moved on to build the arts end of the Bodleian Library. In August 1611 Holt was working with another group of masons who had come from Somerset to build Wadham College under the direction of William Arnold. He subsequently rejoined Akroyd and Bentley to work on the Schools Quadrangle of the Bodleian which had been commenced in March 1613. In 1618, aged forty, following the deaths of his former partners, he took over the direction of the works and was still engaged on the site after 1621 when he was working on the gates. His other commissions within the university included unspecified contracts for Jesus College and Hart Hall for which payments were outstanding at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Holt's wife, Margaret Facer, probably came from Britwell Salome near Watlington, Oxfordshire, and they established their home and workshop in Oxford at 17 Holywell Street at a house leased from Merton College. Holt died there, comparatively wealthy, on 9 September 1624. He left instructions in his will that his two eldest sons, Thomas and John, should be apprenticed &#145;as soon as may be&#146; and made provision for three younger children. He was buried in St Cross churchyard, Holywell, where Anthony Wood recorded a monument erected by Margaret which described him as &#145;Scholarum publicarum architect[us]&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Survey</span>, 190). This has led to claims that he designed both the Schools Quadrangle and Wadham College, neither of which can be substantiated. Holt was not an architect in the modern sense but rather a skilled and successful carpenter. When he was registered a privileged person of the university in 1618 it was as &#145;faberlignarius Coll. Novi&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. Oxf.</span>, 2/1.404). The reference is to the new college of Wadham, and the conservative hammerbeam roof in the hall can be considered his most visible achievement.<br>
