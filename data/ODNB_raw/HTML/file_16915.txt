<span class="headword">Locock, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (1799&#150;1875), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born at Northampton on 21 April 1799, the son of Henry Locock (<i>d</i>. 1843), medical practitioner, and his first wife, Susannah Smyth. For three years he was resident private pupil of Benjamin Brodie, the influential surgeon to St George's Hospital, London, then attended lectures at the school of medicine in Great Windmill Street, and afterwards graduated MD at Edinburgh in 1821 with a <span class="italic">Dissertatio medico inauguralis de cordis palpitatione</span>, which was published in the same year and dedicated to a new mentor, Andrew Duncan. Just prior to this he had undertaken a journey to the continent. In 1822 he was a house pupil at the Westminster Lying-in Hospital. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians the next year. Brodie recommended Locock to devote himself to the practice of midwifery, and he was fortunate in receiving the support of Robert Gooch, who was retiring from practical midwifery and referred many of his patients to Locock. From a small practice based near Oxford Street, he rapidly rose to eminence, and for many years had the largest practice in London as an accoucheur. On 5 August 1826 Locock married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1867), youngest daughter of John Lewis of Southampton Place, Euston Square, London. In 1834&#150;5 Locock lectured on midwifery at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and was for many years physician to the Westminster Lying-in Hospital. He was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1836, and was a member of its council in 1840&#150;42. In 1840 he was appointed first physician accoucheur to Queen Victoria, and attended at the births of all her children, using chloroform in later ones. Besides contributing seven articles to the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span> and another two to the <span class="italic">Library of Medicine</span> (ed. A. Tweedie, 1840), he made a valuable contribution to medicine by the discovery of the efficacy of bromide of potassium in epilepsy, analysing fifty-two cases in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (1857, 1.527&#150;8).<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1857 he was created a baronet, although he had declined the honour in 1840. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857, president of the Obstetrical Society of London, and was elected FRS in 1864, and created DCL (Oxon.) in 1864. He was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for the county of Kent. He unsuccessfully contested the Isle of Wight as a Conservative in 1865. Locock was &#145;small in person and slight, firm and decided in manner, and to strangers undemonstrative to the extent of coldness&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 151). Locock, who worried about his health to the point of hypochondria, died on 23 July 1875. Sir James Paget described him as having great power of work and devotion to duty, keen insight, and great practical knowledge of the medical profession. He made quick, clear diagnoses, and his decisive manner inspired confidence and loyalty in his many patients. He was neither a scholar nor an innovator, but had many social qualities. Thus it was as much the personal as the professional regard in which he was held, together with the loyal patronage he enjoyed from an unusually early age, which ensured his success. Locock and his wife had five sons, of whom the eldest, Charles Brodie (1827&#150;1890), succeeded to the baronetcy, and the third, Sidney (1834&#150;1885), was the British minister resident in Serbia from 1881 until his death on 30 August 1885.<br>
