<span class="headword">Baron,  Bernhard</span>  (1850&#150;1929), <span class="occ">tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist</span>, was born on 5 December 1850 in the Russian town of Brest Litovsk. His parents were both Jewish and he was probably of French descent. In 1867 he emigrated to New York, where he worked in a tobacco factory, sleeping at night in the tobacco sheds; with tobacco lent to him by one of the foremen, he started to manufacture handmade cigarettes. He then moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where he found customers among the students of Yale University. After the failure in 1874 of a New York bank in which he had invested his savings, he was forced to find employment in the tobacco factory of Kinney Brothers of New York but, as soon as he had saved enough, moved to Baltimore, where he began manufacturing cigars. The business prospered and, according to Baron, became the largest undertaking of its kind south of Philadelphia. During this period, the mechanization of cigarette production was in its infancy, and in 1872 Baron took out his first patent for a machine for making cigarettes. In 1890 Baron was persuaded by a group of financiers to join a venture aimed at challenging the powerful tobacco trusts, and during 1890&#150;95 was managing director of the National Cigarette Tobacco Company of New York.<br>
<br>In 1895 Baron visited England to sell the patent rights of his cigarette-making machine, but, attracted by the opportunities, decided to settle in London at St James' Place, Aldgate, where he established the Baron Cigarette Machine Company Limited (the patent was later sold to the United Cigarette Machine Company for &pound;120,000). Subsequently, he decided to expand into the production of tobacco and cigarettes, and, at its incorporation in 1903, joined the board of Carreras Limited, a firm of tobacco retailers and blenders. The following year he became managing director and in 1905, chairman; he held both positions until his death. Carreras's cigarettes, notably their Black Cat and Craven A brands, which were backed by innovative marketing, including competitions and gift coupons, proved highly popular. In 1920 the business moved to new premises, the Arcadia Works, City Road, London, which in 1928 were replaced by a major new factory at Mornington Crescent.<br>
<br>Baron's business success brought him immense wealth, which was matched by the scale of his philanthropic ventures. The harshness of his early life fostered a deep sympathy with the poor and he gave liberally, regardless of religious creed. Among his major gifts were &pound;65,000 to the St George's Jewish Settlement in east London, &pound;35,000 to the London Hospital, and a new children's ward at the Middlesex Hospital. A caring employer, in 1926 he purchased Pennant Lodge at Brighton and set up a trust to manage the Bernhard Baron Convalescent Home for the use of his employees and others engaged in manual and domestic labour. Two years later he created a further trust of &pound;575,000 to benefit hospitals and homes for disabled children, and in his will established a charities fund which supported organizations of many religious denominations. He celebrated his birthdays by making numerous gifts; to mark his seventy-seventh birthday he distributed &pound;32,000, and that year alone donated a total of &pound;180,000. During the course of his lifetime it is estimated that he gave at least &pound;2 million to help the poor, but he was still able to leave almost &pound;5 million at his death. An enthusiastic supporter of the Labour Party, he also gave generously to party funds.<br>
<br>While still living in the USA Baron had married Rachel Schwartz of Washington, who predeceased him in 1920. There were three daughters and one son, Louis Bernhard, who succeeded his father as chairman of Carreras and was created a baronet in 1930. Baron died at his home, 64 The Drive, Hove, Sussex, on 1 August 1929, and was buried on 6 August at the cemetery of the Liberal Jewish synagogue, Willesden, London.<br>
