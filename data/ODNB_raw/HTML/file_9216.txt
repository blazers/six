<span class="headword">Favour,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1557&#150;1624), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Southampton and attended Winchester College before matriculating as a scholar of New College, Oxford, in 1576. He was elected a fellow in 1578 and graduated BCL in 1584 and DCL in 1592. In January 1594 Favour was instituted to the crown living of Halifax at the suggestion of Henry, earl of Huntingdon, who saw the town as a potentially important base for the spread of committed protestant views in an otherwise inhospitable region. Favour transformed the religious life of the area during his thirty years as vicar and Halifax became the base for a ministry which operated throughout the diocese. His puritan views did not find immediate support in the town, however, and a comprehensive, and never to be repeated, presentment was made against his puritan innovations at the visitation of 1596. Thereafter the vicar seems to have won over his more significant parishioners and the place became noted for the consistent implementation of godly discipline on the laity through presentments at visitation. Favour also achieved standing among like-minded clergy, and through the preaching exercise set up in the town in the early seventeenth century, as well as the use of the patronage which he had, as vicar, over the chapelries of the parish, Halifax became the centre for moderate puritan activity in the county.<br>
<br>Favour described his ministry as &#145;preaching every Sabbath day, lecturing every day in the weeke, exercising iustice in the Commonwealth, practising of Physicke and Chirurgerie&#146;  (Favour, dedication), and his pastoral abilities contributed greatly to a reputation which he turned to practical effect by reviving the charitable impulses of the community. He breathed new life into the project to found a new grammar school at Heath, for which he elicited grants totalling more than &pound;700 by 1623 from parishioners or worthies connected with the town, and he also secured financial support for decayed chapelries; Raistrick in 1602, Ripponden in 1610, Cross Stone in 1616, Sowerby in 1622, and Luddenden in 1624 were either reopened or enlarged in his time and others followed soon after. Clergy were appointed and sermons endowed, and ministers in trouble with the diocesan authorities could expect support from the vicar.<br>
<br>This was due in part to the support which Favour himself received from the archbishop, Tobie Matthew, whose chaplain he was. Favour had been made a canon of Southwell in 1611 and of York Minster in 1614, being appointed precentor of York in 1617. He was also a magistrate for the West Riding and member of the high commission at York, becoming a regular attender at meetings from 1616. His wider ministry involved the writing of a defence of the English church against Rome which he published in 1619 in a lengthy tome as <span class="italic">Antiquitie Triumphing over Noveltie</span>, having been encouraged in the endeavour by Archbishop Matthew, who gave him access to his extensive library during its composition and to whom the work was dedicated. The volume is noted more for its earnestness than its combativeness.<br>
<br>Favour had married Ann Power, probably the daughter of William Power, rector of Barwick in Elmet, in 1595, and in his later years was something of a patriarch among a group of younger, largely Cambridge-educated, puritan ministers working in the area. He remained close to Archbishop Matthew, and to Matthew's wife throughout his life, remembering both of them in his will, to which Alexander Cooke, vicar of Leeds, was a witness. He died in Halifax on 10 March 1624 and was buried in the chancel of Halifax church, where there is a monument to him at the west end, showing him in preaching mode. He was survived by his wife. He left a community whose attachment to puritan ideals and the dissenting tradition was to remain strong throughout the changes of the century following his death.<br>
