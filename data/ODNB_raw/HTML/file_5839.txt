<span class="headword">Colclough,  John Henry</span>  (1769/70&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was the son of Thomas Francis Colclough, a successful merchant at Wexford, of Ballyteigue Castle, near Kilmore Quay, co. Wexford. Though collateral to the Colcloughs of Tintern Abbey, the details of his immediate family are so obscure that his mother eludes identification. Arising out of his Roman Catholicism, he went abroad to train as a doctor, following which he married Elizabeth Berry.<br>
<br>On his return to co. Wexford, Colclough joined the United Irishmen, and though his precise involvement remains obscure he was, in his own words, one of &#145;the principal&#146; activists  (Madden, 4.496). His prominence is affirmed by the suggestion that he should become secretary to a proposed county committee in 1797. The committee was never established, but Colclough's public profile and Jonah Barrington's prophecy, arising out of a sequence of social encounters in April 1798, that he would die on the gallows has given the impression that he was more hardline than was in fact the case. Significantly, Colclough did not hold a military office in the United Irish organization. At the same time, his arrest, along with Bagenal Harvey and Edward Fitzgerald of Newpark, on 27 May, and his imprisonment in Wexford, impeded the rising in the south of the county. The success of the insurgent armies elsewhere ensured Wexford town soon came under threat, arising out of which the garrison directed Fitzgerald and Colclough on 29 May to go to the rebel camp at Vinegar Hill to request them to disperse. The fact that Colclough undertook this unusual request, that he did not follow the example of Edward Fitzgerald and stay with the insurgents once he had delivered the message, and that he sought, following his return to Wexford with the insurgents' reply calling upon the town garrison to surrender, to persuade United Irish units in the areas of Bargy and Forth not to join the rising, is consonant with his later claim that he was not persuaded of the wisdom of rebellion.<br>
<br>The capture of Wexford town on 30 May, however, left Colclough with little option but to join in military activity and he took his place with the leaders of the insurgent army that marched westward out of the town on 31 May. Control of New Ross was a key strategic object if the insurgents were not to be hemmed in by the gathering forces of the crown, but the units commanded by Colclough performed badly under fire and their abandonment of their position on 5 June contributed to the costly failure to take the town. Colclough's preference at this point was to sue for peace but the authorities were uninterested. He redeemed his military reputation by commanding the insurgents who almost broke through the lines of General Sir John Moore at Goff's Bridge on 20 June; realizing that military defeat was only a matter of time once the main insurgent army was defeated at Vinegar Hill a day later, he fled Wexford and took refuge on the Saltee Islands. Captured and taken to Wexford town a few days later, Colclough was tried by court martial, found guilty of involvement in the battle of New Ross, and hanged on Wexford Bridge on 28 June. He was in his twenty-ninth year, and he was buried in St Patrick's churchyard in Wexford. His wife survived him. It has been stated that he did not expect the sentence to be imposed. Certainly, his salute to &#145;king and constitution&#146;  (Madden, 4.496) at the gallows sustains the impression that he was never entirely committed to the rebellion.<br>
