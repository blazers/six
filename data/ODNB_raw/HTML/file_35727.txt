<span class="headword">Rendle,  Alfred Barton</span>  (1865&#150;1938), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Lewisham, London, on 19 January 1865, the eldest child and only son of John Samuel Rendle, secretary to a London building society, and his wife, Jane Wilson, daughter of John Barton, of Rotherfield, Sussex. Both parents were of Cornish stock.<br>
<br>After local schooling, a series of scholarships which Rendle then won paid almost entirely for his subsequent education. One to St Olave's Grammar School, Southwark, London, was followed by another to St John's College, Cambridge, where he took the natural sciences tripos and graduated in 1887 with first-class honours in botany. Though C. C. Babington was then still professor of botany, he was in his eighties and occupied solely in taxonomic research. This left teaching in the inspiring hands of the then reader, S. H. Vines, an arch-protagonist of the so-called &#145;new botany&#146;, in which taxonomy was abhorred and aspects such as physiology and morphology were emphasized instead. Rendle was captivated by these and planned to pursue postgraduate research on them. Almost at once, however, Vines moved to Oxford on appointment to the chair there, leaving Rendle to choose between a very uncertain future at Cambridge and the security of a post elsewhere. He opted for the latter, but the post he took must have seemed tantamount to deserting to the enemy: an assistantship in the department of botany of the British Museum (Natural History), which promised a lifetime career identifying and describing dried specimens in the museum's collections. However, with the conscientiousness that was always his outstanding characteristic he set about proving he was better fitted for his chosen life's work than his doubters probably suspected.<br>
<br>His future secure, Rendle married Alice Maud, daughter of James Armstrong, in 1892. Two sons (one of whom died in infancy) and a daughter followed, and it was doubtless the extra financial burden that led him to take up evening teaching. Experience as a junior demonstrator at Cambridge had given him a taste for this, and on being appointed head of the botany department at the Birkbeck Institute in 1894 he was to lecture there, with long-remembered lucidity, two or three times a week for the next twelve years. This led to his producing his best-known work, <span class="italic">The Classification of Flowering Plants</span>, for many years the standard textbook on that subject; the first volume appeared in 1904 but the second, due to heavy competing calls on his time, was not published until 1925.<br>
<br>After only four years of marriage Rendle's wife died, leaving him with a very young family. A second marriage in 1898, however, to Florence (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of George Brown, was to bring him five further sons (one of whom, again, died in infancy) and another daughter. By a happy chance his marriage occurred just as his first major and important works were about to be published. Ever careful and thorough, he did not hurry into print and it was only after eleven years at the museum that his section on the monocotyledons and gymnosperms (his areas of general responsibility as a staff member) appeared in the department's long-outstanding <span class="italic">Catalogue of the African Plants Collected by Dr. Friedrich Welwitsch in 1853&#150;61</span> (1899). The previous year his monograph of the genus <i>Najas</i> had gained him the degree of DSc from London University, and its subsequent publication in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Linnean Society</span> led to his being invited to write the account of the Najadaceae for Adolf Engler's titanic enterprise, <span class="italic">Das Pflanzenreich</span> (1901). Rendle did particular service to plant taxonomy through his concern with the thorny topic of nomenclature. At the International Botanical Congress held at Vienna in 1905 he was appointed one of the four editors to revise the international code of botanical nomenclature, the publication of which proved of historic importance. He continued to act as an expert in this connection until 1935.<br>
<br>In 1906, Rendle was appointed to the keepership of botany at the museum, a post with significant administrative duties that compelled deferment of much of his scientific work. However, by this time he had won recognition as one of the country's foremost taxonomists, a standing crowned by election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1909. Further honours began piling up a few years later: botanical secretary of the Linnean Society and president of section K (botany) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1916, the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1917, and president of the Linnean Society in 1923, in which last capacity he saw that body through a difficult period in its history. Meanwhile his meticulousness and quiet dependability made him an obvious choice as an editor. At first he succumbed in that direction only to the extent of overseeing the botanical contributions to the justly famed eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1911), but, on the death of his colleague, James Britten, in 1924, he finally yielded to a renewed plea to take on the task of editing the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, the monthly which was the outlet for much of the museum's botanical work. He remained editor until just before his death.<br>
<br>Rendle was also increasingly in demand in the world of amateur science as a president in that quarter too. In 1919 he was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club, and in 1927 and 1931 respectively of the south of England's two federations of local societies. From 1911 until his death he also acted as president of the South London Botanical Institute. In this sphere he particularly lent his voice, and the weight of his official position, to furthering the protection of the country's native wild plants, a cause which began to gather considerable momentum in the inter-war years.<br>
<br>Rendle received the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch memorial medal in 1929, the year that he was widowed for the second time. He retired from the museum in 1930, a year which coincided with a term on the council of the Royal Society. Rendle spent his retirement in a return to his long-deferred scientific work, regularly returning to the department of botany in a long-distance race to complete the comprehensive and deeply scholarly <span class="italic">Flora of Jamaica</span>, upon which, with his friend and collaborator William Fawcett (<i>d</i>. 1926), he had embarked many years earlier. Planned in seven volumes, five had appeared by the time of Rendle's death.<br>
<br>Although Rendle's health had given rise to anxiety, he accompanied a delegation from the British Association to the silver jubilee of the Indian Science Association. But a chill which he contracted on the outward voyage awakened an earlier internal complaint and compelled his premature return from Bombay. Three days after getting back, he died, on 11 January 1938, at Tallard, The Mount, Leatherhead, Surrey, which he had had built as his retirement home. <i>Rendlia</i>, a genus of African grasses, serves as his living memorial.<br>
