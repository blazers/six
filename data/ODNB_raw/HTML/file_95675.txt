<span class="headword">Duma,  Dervish</span>  (1908&#150;1998), <span class="occ">diplomatist and leader of the Albanian community in Britain</span>, was born on 4 July 1908 in Borsh on the southern coast of Albania, then still part of the Ottoman empire, the son of Emin Duma (<i>d</i>. 1922), from a local landowning family. In 1914 the village of Borsh was razed to the ground by Greek troops and his family fled to Vlora. He attended an Italian school in Vlora and a secondary school in Gjirokastra. Both his father and his mother had died by the time he was fourteen. In 1921, the year before his father's death, he was chosen to be among the first group of pupils to attend the American Vocational School in Tirana, founded by Harry T. Fultz. After graduation in engineering in 1926 he worked in Vlora as an assistant engineer for the Italian oil company AIPA until November 1927. In 1928, with a recommendation from Fultz, Duma found employment with Sir Jocelyn Percy, who had arrived in Albania in the autumn of 1927 to set up the Albanian gendarmerie, later the Royal Albanian Gendarmerie, under King Zog. Duma served Percy and his small group of British officers, initially in Shkodra and Mirdita and later in Tirana, as an English interpreter, and in 1931 was appointed secretary-general of the gendarmerie of the royal court. It was with Percy's assistance and an Albanian government scholarship that Duma was sent to study in England in October 1932. From 1933 to 1935 he studied public administration at the London School of Economics and went back to Albania in December 1935 to join the diplomatic service.<br>
<br>Duma returned to London almost immediately to serve as second secretary at the Albanian legation in London and, concurrently, as first secretary of the Albanian delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva. That he was already a diplomat of note can be inferred from the rumours which spread in the spring of 1937 that he was to be appointed Albanian foreign minister. He nevertheless remained at the Albanian legation in London, where he was charg&eacute; d'affaires in 1939. A British Foreign Office memorandum described him as &#145;Perhaps the brightest of the young Albanians here &hellip; a bit of a radical, but basically quite sound&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 21 May 1998).<br>
<br>In April 1939 Italy invaded and occupied Albania. Duma was recalled to Tirana but, rather than serve Mussolini's growing fascist empire, he resigned and stayed in England. In August 1939 Sir Eric Bowater offered him employment with the Bowater Paper Corporation, which had paper mills in England, Scandinavia, and North America, and later a steamship company. Duma had a long and successful career with Bowaters, from which he retired in 1974. He travelled annually to the United States and Canada, both to look after the company's interests and to maintain links with the growing communities of Albanian immigrants there.<br>
<br>In November 1940 Duma inaugurated the BBC's Albanian service and began a series of nightly broadcasts to Albania at war. He also assisted Zog when the king arrived in London in 1941 with his entourage of thirty-five relatives and friends. The king, with Queen Geraldine and his five sisters, initially held court on the third floor of the Ritz Hotel, and Duma assisted them in various practical matters. He was also in close contact over the years with Sir Jocelyn Percy; Faik Bey Konitza, the noted publicist and Albanian ambassador to the United States; Archbishop Fan Noli, the one-time prime minister of Albania; the British writer and anthropologist Edith Durham, and the British feminist Sylvia Pankhurst. In the decades after the Second World War Duma became the leading figure of the Albanian exile community in London. He was also a prominent member of the Anglo-Albanian Association, founded in 1912 by Edith Durham and Aubrey Herbert. At the time of his death he was its chairman, having served it for sixty-two years.<br>
<br>In 1936 Duma had married Naftali Andoni (<i>d</i>. 1966). As the <i>&eacute;minence grise</i> of the Albanian community in Britain, he was proud that his son, Alexander, played a central role in the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and in 1992 became the first Albanian representative in London since 1939, in the role of honorary consul. On 15 February 1993, when the BBC resumed its broadcasts in Albanian, which had been suspended by the government of Harold Wilson on 20 January 1967 for financial reasons, it was Dervish Duma who was invited to inaugurate the new Albanian service. He died at Dene Place, Ripley Lane, West Horsley, Surrey, on 6 May 1998, of heart failure. He was survived by his son, Alexander.<br>
