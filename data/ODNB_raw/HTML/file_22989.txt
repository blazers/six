<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Ralph</span>  (1518/19&#150;1559), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and playwright</span>, is of uncertain origins. The Radcliffe monument in St Mary's Church, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, declares that in the reign of Henry VIII Ralph &#145;came out of Lancashire where his Ancestours were antiently seated one of whom was Richard Radcliffe of Radcliffe Tower&#146;. According to Hine's <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, he was descended from a younger brother branch of this noble Lancashire stock, and his father was Thomas Radcliffe of Ordsall. He was a poor but talented scholar, and by 1533 was installed in the Carmelite house in Cambridge, being drawn to Thomas Cromwell's notice as &#145;an excellent scholar in Greek and Latin&#146; suitable for the post of grammar master at Jesus College. As this letter of recommendation reveals, he was considered particularly worthy because of the accomplished polemical works he had penned &#145;against our school men in Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, addenda, 1/2, no. 624). Radcliffe secured the post, and financed his studies both through his teaching at Jesus, and through tutoring the children of the marquess of Dorset. He graduated BA at Cambridge in 1535&#150;6, and MA in 1538&#150;9, having sparked controversy there by challenging John Cheke's pronunciation of Greek.<br>
<br>Radcliffe's radical protestant credentials meant that, following the dissolution of the monasteries, he was granted permission to establish a school for boys in the dismantled Carmelite priory at Hitchin where he took up residence about 1539. He married Elizabeth Marshall of Mitcham, and they had four children: Ralph, Jeremy, Edward, and Elizabeth. The eldest, Ralph, was educated by Radcliffe's close friend Roger Ascham.<br>
<br>Radcliffe became a celebrity in Hitchin and beyond largely because of the plays that he wrote for his pupils to perform, at least once a year, for public audiences on a stage erected in the lower part of the priory. Along with noted reformers like John Bale and John Foxe, he clearly believed in the important role of the popular stage in the war against the Roman Catholic &#145;Antichrist&#146;. Besides tragedies and comedies in Latin and English, Radcliffe wrote dramatic dialogues in the vernacular. Three of these survive, confirming his flair for penning entertaining polemics. The dialogues are bound together in a presentation volume (<i>c</i>.1540) for Henry VIII, and the contents are prefaced as:<blockquote>iii dialogues: the firste concernyng a governance of the Chyrche (the Interspekers &hellip; be these. The Chyrche. The two bysshoppes. The iii dyssemblars. The foole. The harlotte, and the Ryche man). The seconde is bytwen the power [poor] man, and fortune. The thirde, bytwen deth, and the goer by the waye. (<span class="italic">Second Report</span>, HMC, 85)</blockquote>None of Radcliffe's other works has survived, and what is known of his theatre and library is mostly reliant on Bale's favourable account of his stay at Hitchin School. Bale waxed enthusiastic about the &#145;theatrum &hellip; longe pulcherrimum&#146; which the schoolmaster had constructed there  (Bale, <span class="italic">Cat.</span>, 700). In the extensive library Bale found pedagogical and grammar treatises as well as Radcliffe's plays, which he admired, urging Radcliffe to publish. Among Radcliffe's plays as listed by Bale are <span class="italic">De patientia Griseldis</span>, <span class="italic">De Melibaeo Chauceriano</span>, <span class="italic">De Sodomae incendio</span>, <span class="italic">De Jo.Hussi damnatione</span>, and <span class="italic">De Judith fortitudine</span>.<br>
<br>By 1553 the school had so flourished that Radcliffe was in a position to purchase the priory estate. A portrait (<i>c</i>.1559) of this frank and genial-looking schoolmaster clutching a scroll of &#145;letters&#146; hung in Hitchin Priory well into the twentieth century; a reproduction of it can be found in Hine's <span class="italic">Worthies</span>. When Radcliffe made his will in 1558 he described himself as &#145;in hoole mynde &hellip; but sick in body&#146;; he died the next year, aged forty, and was buried in St Mary's Church, Hitchin.<br>
