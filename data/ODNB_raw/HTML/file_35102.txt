<span class="headword">Morgan,  Edward Delmar</span>  (1840&#150;1909), <span class="occ">linguist and traveller</span>, born at Stratford, Essex, on 19 April 1840, was the only son of Edward John Morgan, an officer in the Madras artillery and later a member of the English factory or merchants' company in St Petersburg, and his wife, Mary Anne Parland. Educated at Eton College (1854&#150;7), he showed a talent for languages from an early age. After leaving school he lived with his parents in St Petersburg, and learnt Russian.<br>
<br>In 1872 Morgan travelled first in Asia, making a journey in Persia with Sir John Underwood Bateman-Champain, a director of the Indo-European Telegraph Company. Morgan subsequently visited Kulja and the neighbouring parts of central Asia. In 1876 he translated from the Russian the central Asian explorer Colonel Nikolay Przhevalsky's <span class="italic">Mongolia, the Tangut Country and the Solitudes of Northern Tibet</span> (2 vols., 1876, with an introduction and notes by Henry Yule). Przhevalsky was one of the most successful Russian explorers in central Asia and winner of the Royal Geographical Society's founder's medal for his exploits. Morgan's translation made accessible his discoveries to an English audience keenly interested in, and deeply suspicious of, Russian activity in central Asia. With Sir Thomas Douglas Forsyth, Morgan translated the same author's <span class="italic">From Kulja across the Tien Shan (Tianshan) to Lobnor</span> (1879). Morgan made later expeditions to Ukraine, being familiar with its language and literature; to the lower part of the Congo (1883), which gave him a keen interest in the affairs of the Free State; to east Africa; and to the Baku oil region of Caucasia.<br>
<br>Morgan, who was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society for forty years and served on its council, contributed much to its <span class="italic">Journal</span>. He was also honorary secretary of the Hakluyt Society (1886&#150;92), and collaborated with C. H. Coote in editing for it (1886) the <span class="italic">Early Voyages and Travels to Russia and Persia, by Anthony Jenkinson and other Englishmen</span>. He was honorary treasurer for the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists (1892), in London, under Max M&uuml;ller's presidency, and edited its transactions (1893). He, with two other fellows, successfully persuaded the Royal Geographical Society to organize the Sixth International Geographical Congress in 1895.<br>
<br>Morgan married on 25 September 1873 Bertha Jardine, daughter of Richard Thomas and his wife, Louisa de Visme. They had four sons and three daughters; the eldest son, Edward Louis Delmar Morgan, lieutenant RN, died in 1900. Morgan died at 15 Roland Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 18 May 1909, and was buried at Copthorne, Sussex, his main home in his later years.<br>
