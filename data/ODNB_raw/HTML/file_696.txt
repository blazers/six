<span class="headword">Montgomery,  Arnulf  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1066&#150;1118<span class="mult">x</span>22), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the sixth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23953/', "Roger de Montgomery, vicomte of the Hi&#232;mois in Normandy and earl of Shrewsbury")</script>, and Mabel, daughter and heir of Guillaume Talvas of Alen&ccedil;on. His career illustrates the opportunities which were available to younger sons of the Norman aristocracy as the Norman settlement of England was consolidated. In the 1090s during the first Norman penetration of west Wales he was established at Pembroke. Here he built a castle whose chapel of St Nicholas he gave to his family foundation of St Martin-de-S&eacute;es in southern Normandy, to which he had also granted a tithe of his property around Argentan in Normandy. He was closely associated with his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14055/', "Hugh de Montgomery, earl of Shrewsbury")</script>, but on his death in 1098 William II granted Hugh's lands and title to their eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2042/', "Robert de Bell&#234;me")</script>, with whom the king had worked closely in Normandy. None the less Arnulf received the title of <i>comes</i> (earl or count) and lands in Holderness in the late 1090s, and had achieved a considerable position by 1101, when he acted as a surety for the new king, Henry I, in the treaty of Dover, but his career in royal service was cut short when he joined his brother Robert's rebellion against the king in 1102. Arnulf approached the Irish king, Muirchertach &Oacute; Bria&iacute;n, from whom he sought help for the rebels and whose daughter Lafracoth he married in the same year. When the rebellion failed Arnulf joined his brother in his conflict with the duke of Normandy, Robert Curthose, but then seized the family stronghold of Alm&eacute;n&ecirc;ches and handed it over to the duke.<br>
<br>Arnulf then began a peripatetic career of some twenty years. In 1103 his Irish father-in-law asked for his help against the Norseman Magnus Bareleg, and Arnulf led the first Norman campaigns in Ireland which defeated the Norse raids. He was reconciled with King Henry by Archbishop Anselm, to whom Arnulf was particularly attached, and in the 1110s he attested several acts of Foulques, count of Anjou. In 1114 he was in the south of France where he witnessed an act involving his great-niece, Philippa, duchess of Aquitaine, and it is quite possible that his constant travelling may have been the result of diplomatic initiatives, for he was described as a man of great probity and the highest reputation. His influence at the court of Count Foulques is indicated by the fact that in 1118 the townsfolk of Alen&ccedil;on, the former centre of his family's power in Normandy, asked him to approach the count for help in their rebellion against Stephen, count of Mortain, King Henry's nephew. He died before 1122, leaving no verifiable descendants.<br>
