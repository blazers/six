<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pirrie,  William James</span>, Viscount Pirrie  (1847&#150;1924), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and shipowner</span>, was born on 24 May 1847 in Quebec, the son of James Alexander Pirrie and Elizabeth Margaret Swan Montgomery. James Pirrie was the son of Captain William Pirrie, a Belfast shipowner and harbour commissioner, and had moved to Canada in 1844 to enter the timber shipping trade. James Pirrie died in 1849 and his widow took her young son William back to Ireland to live with his grandfather. The younger William Pirrie was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution from 1858 until 1862, at which time he became a premium apprentice at Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilders.<br>
<br>During his apprenticeship Pirrie displayed an aptitude not only for shipbuilding and design but also for financial management. In 1868 he was appointed chief draughtsman, and he helped to design the first Atlantic liners for the White Star Line of Thomas Henry Ismay. By 1874 both Edward Harland and Gustav Wolff, the founders of the firm, wished to pursue other business interests and Pirrie, aged only twenty-seven, was made a partner in the firm. The serious recession of the mid-1870s made it difficult to win orders; but prospects had improved by the end of the decade when a large engine works was constructed. On 17 April 1879 Pirrie married his cousin Margaret Montgomery Carlisle (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of John Carlisle, headmaster of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution; the couple had no children. His wife was a well-educated woman with an interest in business, and Pirrie quickly came to rely on her advice and judgement. In particular, Margaret Pirrie concerned herself with welfare provision in the firm. Pirrie, a small and charming man with sparkling blue eyes, was said to be remarkably persuasive in selling ships. However, despite this reputation, he won many orders only by offering very generous financing or in recessions building at almost cost.<br>
<br>The Irish home rule crisis of 1885&#150;6 posed a serious threat to the firm. The partners made emergency arrangements to move the yard to Seacombe on the Mersey. Pirrie was outspoken in his attack on home rule and publicly threatened to move the business to the Clyde. It is not known if he had any hand in the expulsion of Catholic workers, but he did nothing to prevent it or to discourage riots by the protestant workforce. With the defeat of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, expansion continued at Belfast with investments in a new yard and extensions to the engine works. By the late 1880s, on Pirrie's initiative, the firm was building large liners on 4 per cent commission, in return for all the customer's repair work and future contracts. Pirrie also developed, as a result, close relations with several large shipping companies, notably the White Star Line, Baltimore Steerage and Lighterage Company, Elder Dempster, and the African Steamship Company. This arrangement brought a large number of contracts, which puzzled competitors with similar cost structures. Pirrie himself became a director of the African Steamship Company in 1892. The following year, with help from Wolff, he formed an alliance with the Hamburg-Amerika Line and the Union Steamship Company.<br>
<br>During the second home rule crisis in 1892&#150;3, Pirrie served as honorary treasurer of the Ulster Defence Union. As a leading Ulster businessman he was propelled into political life, being elected to the Belfast corporation in 1894. Although opposed to independence he was not a &#145;stone wall Unionist&#146;, and favoured some measure of devolution. This did not prevent his financing Unionist candidates in Scotland in the 1896 election. At the same time he became a harbour commissioner. These commitments took him away from the shipyard, which in the politically uncertain climate combined with a recession was forced to offer generous finance to gain orders. After Harland's death in 1895, Pirrie became chairman of Harland and Wolff. He was also elected lord mayor of Belfast and immediately renounced his political affiliations by proposing some measure of representation for the nationalist and Labour parties. This softening of his attitudes was entirely characteristic and not out of tune with some elements of protestant opinion. Both he and his wife had been influenced by liberal attitudes since their childhood.<br>
<br>At the end of the century the business boomed. As Britain's leading shipbuilder Pirrie shifted his operational headquarters to London in 1898; and he and his wife made a glittering social d&eacute;but in the capital, renting Downshire House in Belgrave Square. Part of his motive for making this move was to help bring about the formation of International Mercantile Marine (IMM), in collaboration with the American financier J. Pierpont Morgan. The Syndicate, as it was known, was formed in 1902 and included many established customers of Harland and Wolff, including White Star, Hamburg-Amerika, the Baltimore Steerage and Lighterage Company, and the Atlantic Transport Company. From the beginning Pirrie had doubts about its likely success and immediately began seeking new customers for the yard, including P. &amp; O., Elder Dempster, and the Royal Mail. Contracts from the Royal Mail brought him together with Owen Cosby Philipps, and the two men were to work closely together for the rest of their lives in creating the Royal Mail group.<br>
<br>Apart from this new interest, Pirrie worked hard to rescue IMM by securing the appointment of J. Bruce Ismay as president of the company. This led directly to an order from White Star for three enormous liners for the north Atlantic service. Before these could be built the yard had to be greatly enlarged. At the same time, to gain access to turbine technology and supplies of steel forgings, Pirrie formed an alliance with John Brown &amp; Co. The first giant liner, the <i>Olympic</i>, was delivered in 1911 and her sister ship, the <i>Titanic</i>, in 1912. The <i>Titanic</i> sank on her maiden voyage, with a loss of more than 1500 lives. Pirrie was not on board, as he was recovering from a prostate operation. The tragedy was the culmination of a difficult period for Pirrie, who had been raised to the peerage in 1906, as Baron Pirrie of Belfast, by the incoming Liberal government. From 1907 to 1913 he served as comptroller of the household of the lord lieutenant at Dublin Castle. He steadfastly supported the government's plans for home rule and tried to mobilize Ulster opinion against Sir Edward Carson. This made him unpopular and at one point, after a meeting in Belfast, he was pelted with rotten eggs as he left for England. These events helped to undermine his health, and by the winter of 1912 he was spending most of his time in London or at Witley Park, near Godalming, Surrey, which had been built by the fraudulent company promoter Whittaker Wright.<br>
<br>Pirrie had not, however, lost interest in his work. During 1911 he purchased a shipyard on the Clyde and while he was recuperating made arrangements to build diesel engines under licence in Glasgow. His style of management was becoming increasingly dictatorial. His senior staff reported directly to him and none of them knew on what terms orders had been accepted. On the outbreak of the First World War, Pirrie, who had always refused to tender for Admiralty contracts, began constructing a series of monitors to be used in support of landings and to bombard the enemy coast. A mass of further orders followed, including some for aircraft. When the unrestricted U-boat campaign began to take its toll of merchant shipping in 1917, the government inaugurated a standard ship programme. In March 1918 Pirrie was appointed controller-general of merchant shipbuilding to expedite the implementation of this programme, against the opposition of much of the industry. Following the Easter rising he returned to the Unionist fold and was created a viscount for his wartime services in 1921 when he joined the senate of the Northern Ireland parliament.<br>
<br>As early as 1916 Pirrie had begun planning for peace and had embarked on a massive series of acquisitions, buying five yards on the Clyde, as well as the Scottish steel makers, Colvilles. By the end of the war he was intending to spend over &pound;20 million on refurbishing his yards and on new plant. He believed passionately that demand for new tonnage in the aftermath of the war would be unprecedented. At first the order-book seemed healthy, largely supported by the Royal Mail group. Now in his seventies, he found it hard to come to terms with the onset of the recession, which forced him to abandon some of his grander schemes. He used his old charm to secure sufficient business to keep the yards open until 1923; but even he was forced to admit that some rationalization, particularly in the steel industry, was inevitable. He was rapidly losing control of the business and had no one in whom to confide the extent of his problems. He was taken ill after a fall in his hen-run in late 1923 and died of pneumonia, aged seventy-seven, on 7 June 1924 on the liner <i>Ebro</i> in the Caribbean, near the coast of South America. He was buried in Belfast city cemetery overlooking his yard. He had made no practical arrangements for his death or retirement, and this negligence wreaked havoc with his businesses. Pirrie's dictatorial ways had blinded him to the need to educate his managers, most of whom lacked strength of character; and there was no son who had been groomed to take over the reins. The chaos in which he left his affairs aggravated the problems of the Royal Mail group. It is hard to judge his career, which was a curious combination of ruthless ambition and a deep desire to bring work and prosperity to Belfast. After his death his wife, Margaret, Viscountess Pirrie, became honorary president of Harland and Wolff.<br>
