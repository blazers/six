<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>, first earl of Moray  (1531/2&#150;1570), <span class="occ">regent of Scotland</span>, was the second eldest (and after 1557 the eldest) among the seven illegitimate sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V (1512&#150;1542), king of Scots")</script>, his mother being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73794/', "Margaret Erskine (d. 1572)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69935/', "James V, mistresses of, and their children")</script>], wife of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven and daughter of John Erskine, fifth Lord Erskine (<i>d</i>. 1555). He was in his third year when in 1534 he and three of his half-brothers&#151;James, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26490/', "John Stewart (c.1531&#150;1563)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26504/', "Robert Stewart (1533&#150;1593)")</script>&#151;were granted papal dispensation from their bastardy, which was regarded as a handicap to ecclesiastical preferment.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Details of Moray's early life are obscure, but his father's affection for his mother and indeed for himself is clear from the generous provision that was made for him. In 1536 his father consulted the pope over a divorce for his mother; James V would then have been able to marry Margaret Erskine, and Lord James Stewart (as he was known) would have been legitimated as heir to the throne. The approach failed. In 1538 he was appointed commendator of the priory of St Andrews, one of the wealthiest monastic foundations in Scotland, a clear mark of his father's favour. His education, first under the supervision of George Buchanan from 1537 and then at St Andrews from 1545, was followed in 1548 by the first of many significant embassies abroad. Stewart had a licence to study in France, and on this short-term visit there he accompanied his half-sister the queen. Earlier in that same year he had given the first clear signs of his military skills, helping to repulse English raids in Fife in January and St Monans in June. From this point his movements are uncertain, with reports of him back in Scotland within the same year  (Lee, 18) or not until 1549  (Herries, 23). Nevertheless, it is clear that he was not active in support of the pro-protestant and pro-English opponents of Cardinal David Beaton during the Castilian crisis in St Andrews. Equally significant as far as his future religious affiliation was concerned was his presence as prior of St Andrews at the first of the three reforming provincial councils held in Edinburgh in 1549. From this point he remained prominent in the service of the crown.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1550 Stewart was betrothed in marriage to Christian, daughter of John Stewart, third earl of Buchan. This contract was not fulfilled, but it benefited Stewart enormously in gaining lands of the earldom. This episode later provided an insight into a material and acquisitive side to Stewart's character. In 1562, after his marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70476/', "Annas Keith")</script> (8 February 1562), he protested to his mother his anger and dishonour at Christian's marriage to his half-brother Robert Douglas. Shamed he may have felt, but not enough to give up his Buchan lands.<h2>
<a name="FollowerofMaryofGuise"></a>Follower of Mary of Guise</h2>Far more significantly Stewart was present on the so-called &#145;brainwashing&#146; expedition to France in 1550 with Mary of Guise and twenty-three other Scottish notables. There he viewed the extravagant Renaissance triumphs mounted in Rouen and elsewhere to mark the French victory over England, and witnessed the first expression of Mary's claim to the throne of England. Along with his colleagues he was alleged to have been bought completely by French pensions and in his own case with the promise of the French priory of Macon. He appeared to be a loyal follower of the policy of Mary of Guise at this point, but in common with many other Scots at this time was apparently not above receiving pay from two masters. In 1550 and 1552 the English privy council register records money paid to him on four separate occasions.<br>
<br>Information about Stewart's movements from this point until 1555 is patchy, but his favour with Mary of Guise (formally regent from 1554) was still strong. Stewart was apparently influential in securing the assistant secretaryship to her for his future close associate and partner, William Maitland of Lethington, in 1554. The Moray&#150;Maitland axis that grew from this appointment became one of the dynamic features of the politics of the succeeding decade, before its collapse into bitter enmity over the question of the restitution of the queen.<br>
<br>The first clear sign of Stewart's protestantism was given in 1555 when he was among those who gathered to listen to John Knox at the house of John Erskine of Dun. After Knox's return to Geneva, in March 1557 Stewart signed a letter inviting him to return to Scotland, though this was later withdrawn, leaving the reformer stranded at Dieppe. Despite these reformist credentials and sympathies, Stewart was relatively late in joining the congregation, being a conspicuous absentee from the first band of 1557. Throughout 1557&#150;8 he was still at the heart of the regime of Mary of Guise. In August 1557 he led a raid into England in support of the &#145;auld alliance&#146; following Mary Tudor's entanglement in the latest round of the Habsburg&#150;Valois struggle. In December 1557 he was chosen as one of the commissioners to attend Mary's wedding to the dauphin, Fran&ccedil;ois, and negotiate the marriage treaty. He set sail in February 1558, but the commissioners' ostensible success in securing recognition of the liberties of Scotland and the claims of the Hamiltons in the succession in return for the crown matrimonial proved a hollow triumph. The French promises were rendered worthless through the secret contract Mary had signed weeks before which essentially transferred Scottish sovereignty to the French.<br>
<br>On his return from France, Stewart avoided the fate that befell four of his fellow commissioners, of death by poison, by apparently being held upside down by his boots to shake the poison out. He was present at the Scottish parliament on 29 November which agreed to honour Fran&ccedil;ois with the crown matrimonial and was deputed to take the sword, sceptre, and crown over to France. These ceremonial honours were never delivered, and Stewart made a number of excuses to avoid the mission.<h2>
<a name="Lordofthecongregation"></a>Lord of the congregation</h2>Stewart's experiences in France were vital in luring him away from his allegiance to Mary of Guise. Over the past decade he had enjoyed the rewards of French friendship, but the price that he and his fellow countrymen were being asked to pay was too much. With his access to the highest echelons of the French and Scottish courts, Stewart could not have been unaware that Scotland was becoming a French province, with all its attendant religious and political implications. He did not have long to wait to make his breach with Mary of Guise complete by finally declaring for the lords of the congregation. In May 1559, following the riot in Perth, the simmering religious and political crisis in Scotland came out in the open. Stewart was sent as one of the regent's commissioners to act as a mediator between herself and the rebels on 25 May. He even succeeded in effecting an agreement between the parties, allowing Mary of Guise to enter Perth on 29 May. At this point Stewart was under intense pressure from the congregation to commit openly to their side, suffering the taunts of Knox, who questioned his commitment to the religion. On 31 May, rightly suspecting the regent's intentions to hold true to the generous terms he had brokered for the rebels, he consented in writing to join the congregation. On the following day, when Mary of Guise broke the Perth agreement, Stewart, along with Archibald Campbell, fourth earl of Argyll, joined the congregation openly. Thenceforward he shared the congregation's fluctuating fortunes. From the despair of the evacuation of Edinburgh&#151;after the failed deposition of Mary of Guise in October 1559&#151;to the relief of the eventual treaty of Edinburgh, Stewart's influence was pivotal. He was quickly established as one of the congregation's leaders and was crucial to the consolidation of the uneasy coalition that made up its membership.<br>
<br>Stewart's political abilities were immediately apparent. In July 1559 he apologized to Sir William Cecil for the congregation's apparent lack of progress, stating: &#145;We are sorry to be judged cold slow and negligent in our proceedings.&#146; In so doing, however, he offered a perceptive acknowledgement of the essential difficulty of the congregation's position, their lack of legitimacy: &#145;you know sir the difficulty of persuading the multitude to revolt against established authority&#146;. He reminded Cecil that, unlike in England or Denmark, protestantism was not a state-sponsored activity. Not for the first or last time a lack of legitimacy hampered a cause identified with Stewart. It was a weakness that Mary of Guise was only too happy to exploit, denouncing the congregation as subversives who &#145;meantt not religion but a plane rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Knox</span>, 1.338). Stewart was particularly vulnerable to these accusations. It was the common talk of England, Scotland, and France that he had designs on the crown himself. Unsurprisingly he denied the charge when it was made personally by Sir James Melville, and in this case his actions provided a far more effective denial than a verbal rebuttal. His handling of the Hamiltons in the interests of the congregation suggests that he was already realistic about his chances of achieving the crown. He knew how vital the Hamiltons were to the congregation's cause and won them by securing the safe return of James Hamilton, third earl of Arran, to Scotland, and by allowing James Hamilton, duke of Ch&acirc;telherault, titular leadership of the congregation. Stewart's critics may say that he did this with an eye to the long game, but his own regal ambitions&#151;if he had any at all&#151;were not allowed to stand in the way of the congregation's victory.<br>
<br>There is no doubt that Stewart was a sincere and convinced protestant, and even allowing for his temporary shift from Knox between 1561 and 1565 he was one of the few acting in 1560 out of genuine religious motives. His enemies even attested to this. It has been argued that it was Stewart as much as the ministers and Knox who after 1567 helped to give the Reformation in Scotland a Calvinistic tone. His regency saw the fortunes of the kirk prosper in a way that it was soon to lament. It is not surprising then that Stewart was looked upon as a captain of Israel by contemporaries such as Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and as the &#145;good regent&#146; by George Buchanan and John Knox. His personal lifestyle seems to support these descriptions. Even when he was estranged from Knox for his defence of Mary's religious liberty, it was reported that &#145;thrice in the week an ordinary sermon [was heard] in the earl of Moray's lodgings in the Queen's house so near to the Mass&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 4.605). Stewart was (unlike his father) by all accounts a loyal and faithful husband and the image of his house as &#145;a holy temple, free from impiety and improper conversation&#146; seems correct  (<span class="italic">History of Scotland</span>, ed. Aikman, 2.573).<br>
<br>Stewart, together with his close ally Maitland of Lethington, was given most credit for the congregation's success by Sir William Cecil and other English commentators. His wide-ranging contribution on the battlefield and at the negotiating table, and with the recruiting drum on behalf of the congregation inspired Sir William Cecil to think of Stewart in kingly terms. The Reformation Parliament, however, with Stewart's blessing advanced the Hamiltons' claim to pre-eminence rather than his own, through the Arran marriage proposal to Elizabeth I of England, and the formal declaration that Ch&acirc;telherault and Arran were second and third persons of the realm. Once more this shows Stewart's political acumen. While no one has ever suggested seriously that he would in his heart have welcomed the sight of Arran as Elizabeth's consort, with all its attendant implications for the advancement of the Hamilton family, Stewart knew he was in no position to stop the proposal. He also recognized that it offered the best way of preserving the unity of the congregation and the continuance of the nascent Anglo-Scottish alliance. Most significantly he was also astute enough to realize that it stood little chance of success. Unsurprisingly Elizabeth rejected Arran as a husband, leaving the congregation in disarray. The fatal blow to the coalition came soon after the end of the Arran marriage project, in December 1560, when Mary's husband, Fran&ccedil;ois II of France, died, raising the almost certain prospect of Mary's return to Scotland as a widowed Roman Catholic monarch old enough to rule in person. Elizabeth, the Hamiltons, and Knox favoured a rapid solution by which Mary would marry the recently rejected Arran. This was dismissed out of hand by Stewart and Maitland, who had a far better grasp of the best way forward in dealing with their queen. A peaceful accommodation with the protestant lords ruling Scotland held great appeal for Mary and her Guise kindred, who sought Mary's smooth establishment in her realm. It was preferable to the Arran offer of marriage and the alternative of the Catholic crusade proposed by John Leslie and George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly. Stewart's entire handling of the difficult period between the death of Fran&ccedil;ois and Mary's return confirms that he was politically astute.<h2>
<a name="MaryinScotland"></a>Mary in Scotland</h2>Following his selection in January 1561 by the convention of the nobility as ambassador to Mary &#145;to fully grope her mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 1.510), Stewart was in a splendid position to promote his strategy. He left Scotland in March and met his sister in France on 15 April at St Dizier, where he stayed with her for five days before proceeding to Paris on 23 April and confiding in the English ambassador Throckmorton. He returned to Edinburgh on 29 May, seeing Elizabeth in London on the way. He had completed his mission well, with his credit in England, France, and Scotland enhanced. He had resisted French attempts to be won back to Roman Catholicism, and retained the high regard in which he was held by the English when he informed Elizabeth of Mary's intentions. He had not received the temporary regency he was looking for from Mary but had put forward the plan that provided the basis for Mary's successful return to Scotland. Mary would recognize the religious <i>status quo</i> and accept Stewart and Maitland as her advisers; in return they would prosecute Mary's claim to the English succession energetically. The memorable advice Stewart offered Mary on his return to Scotland in a letter dated 10 June&#151;&#145;madame, for the luif of God presse na maters of religion, not for ony mans' advise on the earth&#146;  (Rose, 161)&#151;held the key to Stewart's strategy and the pre-eminence of the partnership with Maitland in the early years of Mary's personal reign.<br>
<br>In August 1561 Mary returned to Scotland and issued a proclamation recognizing the religious <i>status quo</i>, in accordance with her half-brother's policy. Stewart was crucial in keeping the radical protestant opposition at bay. He physically defended Mary's right to hear mass in her own chapel and in the process earned the stinging rebuke of Knox, who was more fearful of one mass &#145;than ten thousand armed enemies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 2.12). In accordance with the Stewart&#150;Maitland strategy, Mary dispatched Maitland as secretary of state to London to prosecute her claims to the English succession.<br>
<br>Early signs of Mary's confidence in her half-brother were not in short supply. On 14 November 1561 Stewart was commissioned <i>carte blanche</i> by the privy council to deal with the borders. The secret grant of his much-longed-for earldom of Moray on 30 January 1562 contrasted sharply with the public and spectacular lavishment of honours upon him and his followers on 8 February 1562 at St Giles's Cathedral, Edinburgh, on his marriage to Lady Annas Keith (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1588), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15276/', "William Keith, third Earl Marischal")</script> and near neighbour of his greatest enemy Huntly. Not content with the public creation of him as earl of Mar on 7 February, on his actual wedding night Moray was treated to the full Renaissance splendour of the Marian court. Knox, who had conducted the marriage service at St Giles's in due Calvinistic solemnity, denounced the vanity of the court. The anonymous author of the <span class="italic">Diurnal of Remarkable Occurents</span> was, however, a more appreciative witness of what was perhaps the first of several major celebrations at the court which combined the elements of Renaissance magnificence&#151;acknowledged as an integral part of Mary's regime&#151;with an overtly political message. The marriage was celebrated with &#145;solemnitie as the lyk hes not bene sene before, the haill nobilitie of this realme being thair present&#146; and with &#145;greit and divers baling and casting of fyre ballis fyrdsperis and running with horsis&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">Diurnal</span>, 70). Mary created ten knights, the majority of whom can be clearly identified as members of Moray's party. John Wishart of Pitarrow, John Stewart of Minto, James Stewart of Traquair, Patrick Learmonth of Dairsie, and Andrew Murray of Balvaird were all members of Moray's household, while William Kirkcaldy of Grange was safely accounted one of his friends.<br>
<br>Moray's marriage and the subsequent distribution of honours among his friends acknowledged the influence of his household and system of clientage. Not among those honoured, but a crucial figure, was Moray's loyal secretary John Wood who followed his master's fortunes faithfully from 1548, even sharing death at the hands of an assassin in the same year as Moray, 1570. Moray's marriage also broadened his power base, as the Earl Marischal was a vocal conservative protestant who supported traditional authority as well as the reformed religion. Moray did not forget his mother's family; he may have had the Erskine claim to the earldom of Mar in mind when he ceased to use the title in September 1562. He had a close relationship with his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7930/', "William Douglas, later sixth earl of Morton")</script>, a stalwart supporter of Scottish protestantism, and also the house of Douglas as a whole, including James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton.<br>
<br>Domestically, the first year of Mary's rule was a year of triumph for Moray. His old enemy in the borders, James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, who had supported Mary of Guise against the congregation, was implicated by Arran in a scheme to kidnap Mary and murder Moray and Maitland. Despite Arran's insanity, the evidence was enough to have Bothwell imprisoned in March 1562, though in August he escaped to France. Moray could also rejoice at the dwindling fortunes of the Hamiltons, whose ambitions had been hit so hard by Elizabeth's and Mary's rejection of Arran and the lapse into madness of the unfortunate suitor. Most satisfying, though, for Moray was the demise of his greatest enemy, the Catholic earl of Huntly. Moray benefited enormously from the fall of the Cock of the North. His importance in Mary's strategy against Huntly was shown by her public proclamation of him as earl of Moray (the creation had remained secret until then) <i>en route</i> for Corrichie at Darnaway Castle in Moray, probably on 10 September 1562. Moray's military prestige rose even higher after his humiliation of Huntly in the field at Corrichie, while materially he benefited from a generous share of the spoils from Huntly's palace of Strathbogie. His sphere of influence was further extended through his acquisition of the sheriffdoms of Elgin, Forres, and Inverness.<br>
<br>Moray's rise in Mary's credit and his loyal support of Mary until 1565 put him on a constant collision course with his former godly allies. Despite remaining personally devout, Moray on a political level was a painful disappointment to the radical protestants. Arguably worse than his defence of Mary's mass was his close association with and benefit from the despised settlement regarding the thirds of benefices, where one third of the income of beneficed clergy was divided between protestant ministers and the government. The man responsible for this alleged division between God and the devil was Moray himself, and the &#145;collector general and universal intromitter&#146; of all the revenues of the benefices was one of his clients, Wishart of Pitarrow. Alexander Clark, Stewart of Minto, and Andrew Wood of Largo, all clients of Moray, were also collectors of the hated thirds. Knox was not slow to denounce Moray, and in 1563 &#145;the matter fell so hot betwixt the earl of Moray and John Knox that familiarly after that time they spoke not together more than a year and a half&#146;  (Lee, 117).<br>
<br>Although the events of 1562 were probably the high point of Moray's alliance with Mary, between 1562 and 1565 strenuous efforts continued to ensure that the relationship was sustained. Also pursued was Mary's claim for the English parliament's recognition of her entitlement to the English succession&#151;the basis of the &#145;amity&#146; with England. A sign of Moray's complete confidence in his and Maitland's control over Mary at this point was his support for the proposed match with Don Carlos of Spain, son of Philip II, for which Maitland negotiated seriously in 1563. He even supported the restitution of Matthew Stewart, fourth earl of Lennox, and was prepared to go along with the farce of the proposal, also in 1563, that Mary should marry Elizabeth's favourite, Robert Dudley, so long as it held the promise of the necessary guarantee. However, the collapse of Moray's personal relationship with Mary and the Moray&#150;Maitland regime was signalled by Elizabeth's declaration of March 1565 that, regardless of whom Mary married, as far as her claim to the English succession was concerned &#145;nothing shall be done until her majesty shall be married or shall notify her determination to marry&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers &hellip; Burghley</span>, 759) and by Mary's subsequent marriage to Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley.<h2>
<a name="MarysmarriageandMoraysrebellion"></a>Mary's marriage and Moray's rebellion</h2>On receipt of Elizabeth's news Moray was described as &#145;the sorrowfullest man that can be&#146; and it is not hard to see why  (NL Scot., MS 3657, fol. 18). Elizabeth's frankness after four years of tortuous foreplay left the amity and Moray's policy in tatters. Darnley's presence in Scotland (he had arrived with his father, Lennox, in 1564) took on a whole new aspect, and everything that Moray had worked for, along with the political compromises he had made and his alienation of the godly, was coming home to roost. His despair led him back into friendship with Knox, as his displeasure at Mary's new independent policy beyond his personal control greatly reduced his previous toleration of Mary's Catholicism. His despair also led him into the biggest political mistake of his career. He refused repeatedly to give consent to the Darnley marriage, and on 3 April 1565 apparently left the court in disgust. In May he told Mary that marriage with Darnley would jeopardize protestantism and the alliance with England. He absented himself from the convention of the nobility at Perth in June, pleading that he was at risk of assassination by the Lennoxes, and in July he and his associates asked Elizabeth for support. Encouraged by a positive response from Elizabeth at this point, open rebellion began in August after Moray had been put to the horn for his repeated failure to attend summons.<br>
<br>If Moray hoped to recreate the favourable circumstances of 1559&#150;60 he was sadly mistaken. The rebellion was a farce, enjoying the ironic title of the chaseabout raid, where no pitched battle was truly sought or fought by either side. Mary was able to outmanoeuvre Moray completely, and he in turn was not supported by all the protestant lords, his former ally Maitland remaining with Mary. Moray gathered his forces in the west, and then moved east, entering Edinburgh on 31 August, but the attempted coup met no enthusiasm. Of his principal supporters, Argyll was kept in the north by Mary's supporter John Stewart, fourth earl of Atholl, and Ch&acirc;telherault was deterred from pursuing the rebellion with the promise of a pardon and lenient terms of exile. Moray retreated from Edinburgh to Dumfries, while Mary placed Lennox in charge of the west and raised levies from the north. In two proclamations in September she depicted Moray as driven only by personal envy and desire for power, and promised a settlement of the religious question (implicitly in favour of protestantism) at the next parliament. This helped to secure Mary the support of many protestant lords, and isolated Moray. He now relied on English aid, but Elizabeth and her council, influenced by Mary's arguments against Moray, decided at the end of September that they could not help him beyond offering asylum. On 6 October Moray and his remaining supporters arrived in England.<br>
<br>This low point of his career saw Moray experiencing an adroit performance of feigned public outrage from Elizabeth. Summoned to Elizabeth's court he received a public remonstrance in front of an international audience on 23 October. Private respite and asylum in Newcastle upon Tyne followed before his carefully rehearsed return to Scotland, in the company of a &pound;1000 subsidy from Elizabeth, on 10 March 1566, the morning after the murder of David Riccio, Mary's Italian-born secretary.<h2>
<a name="TheendofMarysreign"></a>The end of Mary's reign</h2>Events in Scotland during his absence had created the sort of alliance Moray had hoped to create in the summer. He was kept well informed by the conspirators, hence his perfectly timed arrival in Edinburgh. In the fallout from the Riccio affair, Moray was gradually able to return to Mary's favour as she exchanged one set of rebels for another. After the birth of Mary's son Charles James (later James VI) in June, Moray was to report to Cecil that he fully enjoyed her favour once more and was able to ensure the return of Maitland from his exile following the Riccio murder. Moray was present at Jedburgh in October 1566 for what threatened to be Mary's deathbed and witnessed her plea for national reconciliation in which he was personally beseeched not to persecute the Catholics after her death. After her recovery he followed Mary to the infamous conference at Craigmillar, which appears now to have been as much about the preparations for the spectacular baptismal celebrations for Charles James the following month at Stirling as about those for the Darnley murder.<br>
<br>The debate as to the truth of the Darnley murder is endless, but it is extremely unlikely that Moray was not conversant with the plot to kill him. The description of Moray being fully apprised of the plot and promising to &#145;looke throw his fingeris thairto&#146;  (Keith, 3.293) is hard to resist. Yet another sign that Moray had learned from his mistakes of 1565 was his departure from Edinburgh across the River Forth on the morning of the murder, though his apologist Buchanan states this was because his wife had miscarried. After the murder Moray lay very low. Using his wife's illness as an excuse, he did not join the court at Seton but managed instead to meet Morton at Dunkeld at the end of February. In March he returned to court, but wrote to Cecil informing him of his desire to travel abroad. In April Moray took leave of Mary and Scotland, with Mary lamenting his departure and his precision in matters of religion.<br>
<br>Moray's sudden wanderlust was the masterstroke of his career. His desire &#145;to see the pairtis of France, Flanderis or ony uther pairtis beyond sey&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">Diurnal</span>, 107) was delightfully vague, but the provision in his will which left Mary as the guardian of his daughter was exceptionally astute. To describe Moray's leave of absence during the tempestuous months from April to August as conspicuous would be an understatement. What made such a move possible was the knowledge that his interests were in safe hands. Vincenzo Laureo, the papal nuncio to Scotland in 1566, offered a very tenable view of events as they unfolded. Writing in Italy in June 1567 and without prior knowledge of Mary's marriage to Bothwell, Laureo drew attention to the importance of the Moray&#150;Maitland axis, arguing that, although Moray had left Scotland, Maitland, &#145;a great friend of Moray&#146;  (Pollen, 271), might either persuade Mary to marry Bothwell (who had returned from exile to a prominent place in Scottish affairs) or ensure Bothwell's exclusion from the queen's favour and recall Moray to power. Laureo's critique of Moray's tactics is strengthened by his later letter of 5 August 1567, written with knowledge of Mary's imprisonment in Lochleven but before Moray's acceptance of the regency. Laureo highlighted once more the importance of the Moray&#150;Maitland axis and offered bitter admiration for Moray's outstanding political acumen:<blockquote>Moray absented himself partly from fear of the earl of Bothwell, partly in order to be able to maintain his favour with the queen and her party no matter what might happen. By this absence he has not only been able to play the part of an innocent man averse to the late tumults but he has also managed by his pretended services to win over both sides to mount the throne as he had planned. What has helped him most has been the crafty counsel of the laird of Lethington a man so astute and unprincipled that in all the late treasons he is thought to have throw the stone (as they say) without seeming to move his hand. (ibid., 401&#150;2)</blockquote>Moray read the political situation astutely, showing considerable finesse in his role as the &#145;innocent man&#146;. On 10 April Moray was in Berwick and later that month he was in London. On 1 May he was in Dieppe and on 15 May he was with the Huguenots Gaspard de Coligny and Henri de Bourbon, prince of Cond&eacute;. He was in Lyons when news reached France of the confrontation at Carberry on 15 June, between the confederate lords (including Moray's allies Morton and Argyll and his uncle John Erskine, earl of Mar) and Mary and her new husband, Bothwell, which had led to Mary's capitulation. His sightseeing was over. Resisting Catherine de' Medici's attempts to win him for France, Moray arrived in England on 25 July and rode into Edinburgh on 11 August. On 15 August he interviewed his half-sister, who had abdicated on 24 July, &#145;like a ghostly father&#146;  (Lee, 210) in Lochleven, listing the errors of the final two years of her reign. On 22 August Moray was proclaimed regent for James VI, with the support of the confederate lords and the protestants of Edinburgh, and with Mary's endorsement.<h2>
<a name="RegentofScotland"></a>Regent of Scotland</h2>The 29-month Moray regency was filled with desperate political struggles and decisions that were immensely significant for the Scottish polity. The kirk at last achieved the victory it had sought in 1560, winning if not the entire patrimony of the Roman Catholic church, then so much else. The second Reformation Parliament of 1567 was far more generous to the radical demands of the kirk than its counterpart of 1560. The general assembly's plaintive cry in the summer of 1567 that the foundation of the kirk had been laid in 1560 but that it still lacked its kaipstone was answered willingly by Moray. Fuelled perhaps by the desperate circumstances in which the party of revolution in 1567 found itself, there was a perceptible air of energy and momentum about its ecclesiastical legislation. Whereas in 1560 it had still claimed to be loyal to its sovereign majesties Mary and Fran&ccedil;ois, it had deposed and imprisoned in 1567 a divinely sanctioned monarch and crowned her son. The winter of 1567 brought a golden age for the kirk in its relations with the state, an ideal to which future Calvinistic dissidents looked back. Part of the reason for the almost classic Calvinistic model relationship between kirk and state at this time was its Calvinist personnel. As regent Moray played the role of the godly prince <i>par excellence</i>, acting in tandem with his client and former tutor George Buchanan, moderator of the Church of Scotland. As principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, Buchanan turned that institution into a major seminary of the kirk, following which it reaped a rich harvest of ministers in the 1570s and 1580s.<br>
<br>It is hard to exaggerate the difficulty of the task that Moray had set himself. As regent he headed an illegitimate regime bereft of the appeal that a legitimate, adult sovereign could draw upon&#151;not to mention the uncomfortable presence of a captive Mary to contend with. His party also had to contend with a significant body of both international and domestic opposition, which questioned how James VI could &#145;evir be justlie king when his mother livis&#146;  (Bannatyne, 126&#150;7). The situation was difficult enough even before Mary's escape from Lochleven on 2 May 1568 induced widespread panic among the king's party. Mary's support came from some of the Hamiltons and the earl of Argyll. Moray refused a settlement with Mary that would have restored her to the throne and provided independence from the Hamiltons, and instead he confronted Mary's army, under Argyll, at Langside near Glasgow on 13 May. Moray and his cavalry commander Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange took maximum advantage of Argyll's sudden illness to overwhelm the superior forces of the queen's party. Moray carefully ordered his men to take prisoners rather than close the door on reconciliation by killing the queen's allies.<br>
<br>It was at Langside that Throckmorton's description of Moray as a captain of Israel seemed most apposite, but in the face of the furore that Mary's flight into England caused the captain of Israel was to find the promised land elusive during the remaining months of his regency. Moray began negotiations with Elizabeth over Mary's fate, leading to the conferences at York and Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569 which he attended in person. Moray attempted to secure his position against Mary by revealing the casket letters to the English representatives, which appeared to prove that Mary had known of the plan to kill Darnley and had committed adultery with Bothwell. The conference ended any pretence that Moray and Maitland were still allies. Moray was already suspicious of Maitland's allegiance and referred to him openly as the necessary evil at this point. Moray included Maitland in the party for the conference only because he was worried about the damage his erstwhile partner would cause in Scotland in his absence. Given the amount of damage Maitland caused in London&#151;with his promotion of the idea that Mary, once divorced from Bothwell, should marry Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk&#151;Moray's suspicions were entirely justified.<br>
<br>The uncertainty of Elizabeth's intentions towards Mary placed Moray in an invidious position. The skill with which he navigated the troubled waters that Mary's trial created was impressive. He responded to the threat of the Norfolk marriage proposal by seeming to give his approval, contingent upon Elizabeth's own support for the matter. He strengthened his own position during the first session held in Westminster in November, by openly accusing his sister of murdering Darnley and by delivering to the English privy council the contents of the casket letters and other doctored evidence designed to protect his own allies and maximize Mary's guilt. Moray succeeded in turning the conference into a trial in all but name, breaking his previous agreement with Mary and hoping to force Elizabeth into having Mary ratify her abdication and publicly recognize his government. The non-verdict of the trial on 10 January 1569&#151;&#145;perhaps the most absurd judicial opinion ever left upon record&#146;  (Tytler, 7.317)&#151;was a personal triumph for Moray. Mary was still a captive in England, and Moray was able to return to Scotland with tacit recognition of his regency and a &pound;5000 English subsidy.<br>
<br>Moray's return to Scotland saw further success for both him and the king's party. Moray gained formal approval for all his actions in England from the Scottish privy council and in April 1569, at a supposed meeting to discuss the problem of Mary, Ch&acirc;telherault (who had disputed Moray's claim to the regency) was imprisoned along with John Maxwell, fourth Lord Herries, who had been one of the principal representatives of Mary at the conference. Moray further reduced the queen's party in May by coming to terms with Huntly and Argyll. At a convention of the nobility in Perth in July, a motion to allow Mary's divorce from Bothwell was defeated by forty votes to nine, conclusive proof of the changed agenda from Carberry, when the professed intention of the confederates was to secure Mary's detachment from Bothwell; it was now more useful to the government to prevent Mary from marrying again. Maitland's support for Mary's divorce&#151;as a precursor to Mary's marriage to Norfolk&#151;signalled open hostilities between the former allies. The Norfolk marriage project provided the perfect solution to Scotland's ills for Maitland, promoting his dream of the union of the realms by marrying Mary to an English husband before her eventual succession. To Moray and the king's party, despite his earlier feigned support, it was to be avoided at all costs as Mary's restoration, combined with an English marriage, would have led to the king's party's eclipse. It was time for Moray to be rid of the menace of Maitland. On 2 September he tricked Maitland into attending a meeting at Stirling, where the latter was arrested, imprisoned, and charged with the murder of Darnley. His trial was set for 22 November.<br>
<br>At this point things did not go according to plan for Moray, and his last months were among his most careworn. Maitland was spectacularly rescued from his imprisonment by Kirkcaldy of Grange (who had deserted Moray for the queen's party) and placed in the comfort of Edinburgh Castle to intrigue with the other key Marian supporters Ch&acirc;telherault and Herries. Maitland's day of law resulted in a public humiliation for the regent. Maitland successfully mobilized his own supporters in Edinburgh, such a force of Hamiltons together with followers of Huntly, Argyll, and Alexander Home, fifth Lord Home (another defector from Moray), that Moray was forced to prorogue Maitland's trial. The outbreak of the northern uprising in England did nothing to ease Moray's burden. His unpopular arrest of the rebel Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland, on 24 December caused outrage even among his own party as transgressing the unwritten law of asylum to political refugees. Yet Moray really had little choice. He could not have afforded to offend Elizabeth, who as Moray knew held the key to the eventual solution of the civil war in Scotland so long as she held Mary. Moray's instructions to his envoy to England, Nicholas Elphinstone, on 2 January 1570 were understandably panic-ridden. He was fighting for his political life, and made Elizabeth aware in no uncertain terms of the basic difficulty of his position&#151;of what Maitland would later refer to as the problem of the regiment of the realm. His enemies would never submit to his authority, whether motivated by envy, ambition, or doubts over whether his regime could be legitimate while Mary lived; he was financially ruined; and he was unable to continue without significant English financial help, formal recognition by England of James VI as king, and a definite decision about Mary.<br>
<br>Moray never received Elizabeth's reply, as he was assassinated in Linlithgow on 23 January 1570. He had been warned to avoid Linlithgow and had even been told of the house from which the fatal shot would come. He chose to ignore the advice. The assassination was perfectly planned by Moray's oldest rivals, the Hamiltons, and executed by their own hitman, James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, complete with camouflage and getaway horse. Within two weeks of Elphinstone's embassy Elizabeth recognized the magnitude of Moray's achievements over the previous three years. In characteristic fashion she seemed to realize just how great a servant Moray had been, and the means he provided to solve her Scottish problem, only at a time when his services were no longer available for hire. Moray's funeral and burial took place on 14 February in St Giles's Cathedral, Edinburgh, and were conducted appropriately enough by John Knox, whose sermon was based upon the text &#145;blessed are the dead, that die in the lord&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 3.83&#150;4). He was succeeded in the earldom of Moray by his daughter Elizabeth (1565&#150;1591), who in 1580 married her kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26480/', "James Stewart (1565/6&#150;1592)")</script>, from then on regarded as second earl of Moray.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Moray's historical reputation has traditionally divided along the faultlines of allegiance to his half-sister Mary, queen of Scots. Favoured by her enemies, condemned by her supporters, Moray was seen most strongly as the &#145;good regent&#146; in the 400-year-old portrait from the pen of his grateful tutor and client, George Buchanan. This picture is not too dissimilar from the one in John Knox's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation in Scotland</span>; lovingly preserved in the twentieth century by Maurice Lee, it has remained the most familiar to students of the period. Alternatively, Moray has been presented as a proto-Shakespearean villain, a product of the loins of James V denied the destiny he felt to be his right by being born on the wrong side of the blanket. The unreliable memoirs of Sir James Melville describe him as an unskilled tennis player, unable to discern the flow of the game, and so &#145;running evir after the ball&#146;  (Melville, 222). This seems a most unfair and inaccurate description. Despite a later critically harsh verdict that Moray was lacking in political acumen and that his rare successes owed more to good luck than to his own unaided designs, it is difficult to square the evidence of his political career with the image of him as inept. During the personal reign of Mary he proved more than capable of learning from his mistakes and reading the game perfectly.<br>
<br>Moray was unquestionably a man of great ability, driven by his protestant faith and capable of great courage and ruthlessness. But despite a contemporary view of him as the &#145;defender of the widow and fatherless&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">Diurnal</span>, 156), it is hard not to think of him in cold, calculating terms. His personal character lacked warmth. The magnitude of his achievements as a regent should not be underestimated, however, and his death represented the nadir of the fortunes of the king's party. As Maitland rightly predicted, his death changed the issues in the civil war, which were now as much about the regiment of the realm as the succession.<br>
