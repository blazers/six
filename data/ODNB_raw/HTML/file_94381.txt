<span class="headword">Blund,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1257), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was a scion of a family prominent in the city of Exeter. As Mr Richard Blund, &#145;chancellor of the church of St Peter&#146;, he was the first witness to a confirmation by Hilary, son of Hugh Blund, of his undated enfeoffment of a miller with his land on Exe Island, Exeter. Hilary, Richard's brother, was provost of Exeter (<i>c</i>.1219 and <i>c</i>.1222&#150;3) and mayor (1224&#150;30 and 1234?&#150;1235). Little is known of Richard's early life, but the fact that he was styled Master indicates that he attended a university. Following the death of William Brewer, bishop of Exeter, on 24 November 1244, the chapter continued its reforming programme by electing Blund (also variously known as Albus, Blundus, Blond, and Blondy), who had long been a canon and was now the cathedral's chancellor, to succeed as bishop. Henry III assented to their choice on 30 January 1245, and again on 17 April, and on 29 September he made Blund a gift of six fallow deer from the forest of Aliceholt, Hampshire, for his consecration feast; he was consecrated bishop on 22 October by Archbishop Boniface at Reading.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris considered Blund an excellent choice because of his worthy character and good education. Of his education, however, nothing is known, and of his deeds little. Only thirty-five of his <i>acta</i> can be identified, of which five are originals. Only eight are dated and none is witnessed. On 6 January 1247 he confirmed his predecessor's <i>inspeximus</i> of Bishop Henry Marshal's settlement of the jurisdictional dispute between the chapter and the archdeacon of Exeter. But he made revisions to restore episcopal authority: for example, he removed the dean and chapter's power to impose an interdict on the city. Occasionally he appeared on a wider stage. Thus on 17 June 1244 he attended the dedication of Beaulieu Abbey church in the presence of the king and queen, while in spring 1253 he was present in parliament, and with other bishops excommunicated offenders against the charters.<br>
<br>The most memorable event of Richard Blund's episcopate occurred as he lay dying or dead in his chamber in his palace at Exeter on 26 December 1257. His household took the opportunity to draft and seal a number of episcopal charters by which various benefices were granted. Present were, eventually, the bishop's chancellor and chamberlain, Walter of Loddiswell, priest, and Mr Richard of Totnes, his clerk and notary. But the actual perpetrators were a group of nine clerks and laymen from the bishop's household. Apparently the documents were drafted by John fitz Robert, the bishop's official, and Gervase of Crediton, engrossed by Thomas of Molland and Richard of Totnes (the chancellor's clerk), and sealed by Henry, the bishop's chaplain. Others named as being present were Thomas, the bishop's pantler, Thomas's son, Reginald, and Caynoc, an episcopal chamberlain. The reasons for this belated activity, although the event was investigated by the bishop's successor, Walter Bronescombe, are unknown. The affair was rather hushed up and petered out in 1259.<br>
<br>Blund's church remembered him as a benefactor of the cathedral's treasury, the donor of vestments and ornaments. His obit, however, was celebrated in the cathedral with only two candles (as for a dean) compared with the four for Bishop Henry Marshal and the eight for Bishop William Brewer. Hooker judged him &#145;a mild spirited man but stowte in his church's cause and liberal to the building thereof&#146;  (Hooker, 230): a man of blameless life and learned attainments.<br>
