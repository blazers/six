</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pirie,  (Douglas Alastair) Gordon</span>  (1931&#150;1991), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born at 123 Beckett Street, Leeds, on 10 February 1931, the son of Alexander Sutherland (Alick) Pirie, a cable telegraphist and athlete, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stead. He was registered at birth as Alistair Pirie, but his name was changed shortly afterwards. His father was a Scottish cross-country international and his brother Peter became a leading runner for the South London Harriers, the club that Pirie also represented. After leaving school Pirie worked first as a bank clerk, then as a paint salesman, while also training and competing as an athlete.<br>
<br>A tall, lanky, almost emaciated figure, Pirie developed a distinctive running style, with a rolling head and an exaggerated breathing technique that earned him the sobriquet Puff Puff. He developed this technique after swallowing flies in training. Although he headed the resurgence of British middle-distance running in the 1950s, he was a dedicated and disciplined athlete rather than an innately talented runner. Essentially he trained harder than his British contemporaries, putting in an average of three hours a day, often training twice a day, and sometimes running at night with his brother, aided by lime blobs to mark their path. His first major victory came in the 6 miles at the 1951 Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championships. Then in 1952, after the Helsinki Olympics, he came under the influence of the German coach Waldermar Gerschler, who introduced him to a more psychological and systematic approach to training.<br>
<br>Two seasons stand out in Pirie's career. In 1953 he set a world record for the 6 miles, won the inaugural Emsley Carr mile at the White City, was a member of the British team which set a world mark for the 4 &times; 1500 metres relay, and took the first of three successive English cross-country titles. In 1956 he equalled and then broke the world record for the 3000 metres and also broke it for the 5000 metres. Yet he never won a world or Olympic title. The closest he came was a silver medal in the 5000 metres in the Melbourne Olympics of 1956. This came a week after he had been broken in a heroic attempt to match the pace of the Russian Vladimir Kucs in the 10,000 metres. In the 5000 metres he opted to run for second place, an uncharacteristic manoeuvre. On 24 September 1956 he married a fellow athlete, Shirley Hampton (<i>b</i>. 1934/5), the daughter of Harold William Hampton, a photoengraver. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Some saw Pirie as arrogant when he prophesied his successes. Certainly he was brash, colourful, and controversial, with a personality as spiky as his haircut. His autobiography was aptly titled <span class="italic">Running Wild</span> (1961). He clashed with officialdom on many occasions. In 1961 he was dropped from the team against West Germany for not reporting on time and subsequently against Poland for declining to explain his lateness. He refused to agree that it was acceptable for athletics officials to write and broadcast about sport but not for him, a major draw card for spectators, to be reimbursed for actually running. It irked him that many of his applications to run abroad&#151;where promoters often took a laxer view of amateur regulations&#151;were turned down by the AAA. It was not only British athletics officials who felt his criticism. On receiving the BBC sports personality of the year award in 1955, he used the occasion to accuse the press of damaging British sport. Later, when travelling to Perth, Australia, as a commentator for the empire games, he agreed to provide fitness training for the English cricket team, who were on board the same vessel. He later described the group as &#145;an unfit, paunchy bunch of barflies&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Dec 1991).<br>
<br>Although he finished only tenth in the 10,000 metres at the Rome Olympics in 1960, Pirie set a personal best time, demonstrating that he had not burned out as a result of his hard training. Before taking his leave of international athletics, at the White City in 1961, he ran a four-minute mile. He dabbled in professional athletics, including a race around a bullring in Spain, and took up orienteering successfully, but generally lost direction once he was away from world athletics. Arguing that taxation was too high in Britain, he emigrated to New Zealand, where he coached and worked in the logging industry. While he was there his marriage ended. In 1980 he was reinstated as an amateur, which allowed him to compete in athletics as a veteran and also to make his d&eacute;but in a marathon. He returned to Europe several times on coaching assignments, and in 1987 he spent a season as director of a running school at Davos in Switzerland. He then moved back to Britain and spent the rest of his life in Hordle, near Lymington, Hampshire. He died at a nursing home, Oakhaven, Lower Pennington Lane, Lymington, on 7 December 1991, after a long fight against cancer, and his ashes were scattered on the Farthing Downs, where he had put in hours of training. He was survived by his two daughters. A memorial service was held at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 25 February 1992. Although he was never a world champion, in his career Pirie held five world records and twenty-two British ones, and his punishing training methods revolutionized British middle-distance running.<br>
