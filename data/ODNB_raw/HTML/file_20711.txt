</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Laurence</span>  (1829&#150;1888), <span class="occ">diplomatist, traveller, and mystic</span>, the only child of Sir Anthony Oliphant (1793&#150;1859) and his wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of Colonel Campbell of the 72nd highlanders, was born at Cape Town. Thomas Oliphant, the musician, was his uncle.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandearlylife"></a>Family background and early life</h2>Oliphant's father, who was third son of Ebenezer Oliphant of Condie and Newton, Perthshire, and Mary, daughter of Sir William Stirling of Ardoch, had been called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1821, and practised for a time in London as an equity draftsman, but just before his son's birth he was appointed attorney-general at the Cape. Oliphant's father and mother were both fervent evangelicals. His mother returned to Europe on account of her health, and took her son with her. He was sent to the school of a Mr Parr at Durnford Manor, Salisbury, but spent part of his holidays with his mother at Condie, an ancestral home of the Oliphant family.<br>
<br>In 1839 Oliphant's father was made chief justice of Ceylon, and was knighted. Lady Oliphant rejoined her husband in Ceylon in 1841, and Oliphant followed in the winter of the same year, in the charge of a private tutor, who continued to teach him in Ceylon; but despite this his education was much interrupted. His father returned on two years' leave about 1846, and spent the time in a continental tour. He was allowed to accompany his parents instead of going to Cambridge, as had been intended. The family spent the winter of 1846&#150;7 in Paris, travelled through Germany and the Tyrol during 1847, and at the end of the year crossed the Alps to Italy, where Oliphant witnessed some of the popular disturbances in the beginning of 1848. He went with his parents to Greece, and then accompanied them back to Ceylon, where he acted as his father's private secretary.<h2>
<a name="Thelawdiplomacyandjournalism"></a>The law, diplomacy, and journalism</h2>Oliphant was called to the colonial bar in Ceylon. He said that by the age of twenty-two he had been engaged in twenty-three murder cases. In December 1851 he was invited by Jang Bahadur (the prime minister of Nepal, who was in Ceylon on a return voyage from England) to join a hunting excursion in Nepal and he reached Katmandu before returning to Ceylon. A few months later he went to England with his mother, and at the end of 1851 began to keep terms at Lincoln's Inn. Besides studying law, he took an interest in the work of Lord Shaftesbury and others among the London poor. In the spring of 1852 he published an account of his tour in Nepal, called <span class="italic">A Journey to Khatmandu</span>. He resolved to be called to the Scottish as well as the English bar, and began studies at Edinburgh in the summer of 1852, but these were never completed.<br>
<br>In August 1852 Oliphant set out with Oswald Smith for a visit to St Petersburg, thence to Nizhniy Novgorod, and ultimately to the Crimea, where they entered Sevastopol in disguise and mapped its fortifications. He published an account of part of the journey, <span class="italic">The Russian Shores of the Black Sea in the Autumn of 1852</span> (1853). The approach of the Crimean War gave special interest to this book, which soon reached a fourth edition. Lord Raglan applied to him for information, and he was engaged to write for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. While keenly interested in this he received an offer of an appointment from James Bruce, eighth earl of Elgin, then governor-in-chief of British North America, with whose family Lady Oliphant was intimate. Oliphant acted as secretary to Lord Elgin during the negotiation at Washington of the reciprocity treaty with Canada, whose economy was in ruins as a result of the repeal of the corn laws in 1846. Elgin's success in achieving free trade between Canada and the USA saved what had been a desperate situation. Oliphant afterwards accompanied Elgin to Quebec. He was soon appointed &#145;superintendent of Indian affairs&#146;, and made a journey to Lake Superior and back by the headwaters of the Mississippi and Chicago, described soon afterwards in <span class="italic">Minnesota and the Far West</span> (1855). Dancing, travelling, and political business filled up his time agreeably; but on Lord Elgin's retirement at the end of 1854, he declined offers of an appointment under Sir Edmund Head, Elgin's successor. He went back to England (whither his father had now finally returned) and put forward a plan, suggested by his previous journeys, which is described in a pamphlet called <span class="italic">The Trans-Caucasian Provinces, the Proper Field of Operation for a Christian Army</span> (1855). While the main allied force was bogged down around Sevastopol, Russian troops were besieging Kars in north-east Turkey; its fall would not only be a severe blow to the Porte, but would renew the Russian threat to Persia, Mesopotamia, and Afghanistan. Oliphant proposed an expedition to relieve Kars through Circassia and the Trans-Caucasian provinces. Privately he asked the foreign secretary, Lord Clarendon, to send him on a personal mission to Schamyl, the Muslim guerrilla leader in the Caucasus, whose aid against the Russians he hoped to secure by the offer of British troops. Clarendon would only go so far as to give Oliphant a recommendation to the British ambassador in Constantinople, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. Oliphant's father accompanied him to Constantinople, where they found Lord Stratford de Redcliffe about to visit the Crimea; they accompanied him thither and Oliphant had a glimpse of the siege of Sevastopol. He could not obtain an authorization for his scheme, but Stratford allowed him to accompany a member of the embassy on a reconnaissance of the Circassian coast. At Trebizond they fell in with the Turkish commander, Omar Pasha. Oliphant, who got on well with Omar Pasha, joined his force and was present at the battle of the Ingour. The fall of Kars made the expedition fruitless; and after much suffering, and a consequent illness during the retreat, Oliphant returned to England at the end of 1855. <span class="italic">The Trans-Caucasian Campaign &hellip; under Omar Pasha</span> (1856) describes his experiences.<br>
<br>Oliphant had been acting as correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span> during his recent expedition, and in 1856 he was invited by the editor, John Delane, to accompany him on a visit to the United States. He travelled through the southern states to New Orleans, and there was invited to join the filibuster William Walker in his audacious attempt to seize Nicaragua and rule it as a private fief. Oliphant said he accepted for the sake of the book he could write; privately he had been charged by Lord Palmerston to find out what was going on so close to the British protectorate of the Mosquito Coast. However, the expedition fell in with HMS <i>Cossack</i> at the mouth of the St Juan River; and when her captain came on board to inspect the &#145;emigrants&#146;, he recognized Oliphant as a British subject in a place where no British subject ought to be, and removed him. An account of this adventure and of his first trip in Circassia is given in <span class="italic">Patriots and Filibusters, or, Incidents of Political and Exploratory Travel</span> (1860).<br>
<br>In 1857 Oliphant became private secretary to Lord Elgin on his visit to China. He accompanied Elgin to Hong Kong, was present at the bombardment of Canton (Guangzhou), and helped to storm Tientsin (Tianjin). He was employed in several minor missions, and visited Japan with the expedition barely eighteen months after the American Townsend Harris had been accredited as the first foreign diplomat to the shogun's government; he published <span class="italic">Narrative of Elgin's Mission to China and Japan</span> in 1859. On his return to England, Oliphant found that his father (with whom he was always on very affectionate terms) had recently died. He was without formal employment for a time, but in 1860 ostensibly amused himself by a visit to Italy, where the drive for unification under the Piedmontese leader, Count Cavour, was entering its last phase. Oliphant was granted an interview with Cavour at the moment when the convention he had agreed with the emperor Napoleon the previous year was about to be made democratically respectable. France had undertaken to help Piedmont drive the Austrians from the Italian peninsula in return for Savoy and Nice. Garibaldi, who was born in Nice, objected to this bargain, and mounted a plot, in which Oliphant became involved, to break up the ballot boxes in Nice on the occasion of the vote for annexation to France. Oliphant gave his view of the value of a plebiscite in a pamphlet called <span class="italic">Universal Suffrage and Napoleon the Third</span> (1860), and as before the Foreign Office benefited from his private observations. Garibaldi's expedition to Sicily broke up the Nice scheme. In 1861 Oliphant travelled in Montenegro and elsewhere, and soon afterwards accepted his first official appointment, as first secretary of legation in Japan. He arrived at Yeddo at the end of June 1861. On the evening of 5 July a night attack was made on the embassy. Oliphant rushed out with a hunting-whip, and was attacked by a Japanese with a heavy two-handed sword. A beam, invisible in the darkness, interfered with the blows, but Oliphant was severely wounded, and sent on board ship to recover. He had to return to England after a visit to the island of Tsushima, strategically placed between Russia and Japan, where a Russian naval force was discovered, and persuaded to retreat.<br>
<br>Oliphant's first invitation on arriving home was to stay with Lord Palmerston at Broadlands. The rest of 1862 was occupied with visits to Corfu (with the prince of Wales, then on his way to Palestine), and afterwards to Herzegovina and the Abruzzi. The Foreign Office chose to announce that &#145;family considerations&#146; obliged Oliphant to retire from the diplomatic service, thus providing cover for a series of unofficial missions. Early in 1863 he visited Poland to look at the insurrection there, and later in the year made another attempt, but was turned back. He then travelled in Moldavia, and went northwards to report the Prussian-Danish War. He was now disposed to settle down. He had already once or twice canvassed Stirling burghs, and made himself popular with the electors. In 1864 he joined Sir Algernon Borthwick and some other friends in starting a journal called <span class="italic">The Owl</span>, of which Thomas Onwhyn was the publisher. It was suggested at a dinner party in fun, and was intended to be partly a mystification, supported by an affected knowledge of profound political secrets. Sir Algernon Borthwick undertook to print it, and it caused much amusement to the initiated. Oliphant contributed only to the first ten numbers, retiring when it was taken up more seriously. In the following year he published the hugely popular &#145;Piccadilly: a fragment of contemporary biography&#146;, in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> (republished, with illustrations by R. Doyle, in 1870).<h2>
<a name="OliphantandThomasLakeHarris"></a>Oliphant and Thomas Lake Harris</h2>In 1865 Oliphant was elected as Liberal MP for Stirling burghs. He did little in parliament but annoy his own side. Passionately in favour of reform, in 1867, when his leader, Gladstone, tried to amend Conservative proposals for the extension of the franchise, Oliphant encouraged fellow Liberals to vote for Disraeli's bill. A singular change now took place in his life. His rambling and adventurous career had given him much experience, but had not made up for a desultory education. He loved excitement, was a universal favourite in society, and had had flirtations in every quarter of the globe. He was a clear-headed man of business, was familiar with official life, and was a brilliant journalist. From his earliest years, however, he had also strong religious impressions, and in his letters to his mother speculations upon his own state of mind and the various phenomena of religions of all varieties had alternated with sparkling descriptions of adventure and society. He had been interested successively in many of the books which reflected contemporary movements of thought. He had read Theodore Parker, W. Smith's <span class="italic">Thorndale</span>, Maurice's writings, and Morell's <span class="italic">History of Philosophy</span>. His lack of a secure belief, however, left him at the mercy of any pretender to inspiration. His official and social experience had dispersed many illusions, and his <span class="italic">Piccadilly</span>, very brightly written, is not a novel proper, but a satire directed against the various hypocrisies and corruptions of society. In it he had come, he said, to think that the world at large was a lunatic asylum  (<span class="italic">Piccadilly</span>, 1870, 262). He referred to &#145;the greatest poet of the age, Thomas Lake Harris&#146;, author of &#145;The Great Republic: a Poem of the Sun&#146;, and typified him in a mysterious prophet who meets the hero; Harris was the head of a community in America called the Brotherhood of the New Life. The creed was a mixture of philosophy and science, which identified &#145;physical sensations&#146; caused by the life of Christ in man, and held that marriage should be a Platonic relationship. Oliphant had also some belief in spiritualism, though he came to regard it as rather diabolical than divine.<br>
<br>In 1867 Oliphant resigned his seat in parliament, and joined Harris's community at Brocton, or &#145;Salem-on-Erie&#146;, in New York state, where the leader was in the habit of casting out devils and forming magnetic circles among his disciples. Oliphant was renamed Woodbine by Harris and became his spiritual slave. He was set to work on the farm, was ordered to drive teams and &#145;cadge strawberries on the railway&#146;, and, after walking all day, was sent out at night to draw water &#145;till his fingers were almost frost-bitten&#146;. He made over all his money to the community. Oliphant's mother also joined the community in 1868, and, though living at the same place, was not allowed to hold any confidential communication with her son. After going through this probation the disciples were to regenerate the world, and mother and son are said to have &#145;found perfect peace and contentment&#146;. In 1870 Oliphant returned to London under Harris's orders, and was supported by a small allowance from Brocton. He resumed his former occupation by becoming correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the Franco-Prussian War. He was with the French and afterwards with the German armies, but suddenly returned to America, in obedience, it was said, to a sign prescribed by Harris&#151;namely, a bullet's grazing his hair. He was soon back, however, and was again correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in Paris towards the end of 1871. His mother was permitted to join him, and it was there that he met Alice (1846?&#150;1887), daughter of Henry le Strange of Hunstanton, Norfolk. All who knew her spoke of her singular attractiveness. She was twenty-six, and had been much admired in society, but she shared some of Oliphant's dissatisfaction with the world. She adopted his creed, and they were engaged at the beginning of 1872. However, the consent of Harris was required and he made one condition: that the marriage was not to be consummated. The genuine &#145;human sentiment&#146; was to be considered as an &#145;abstract and spiritual passion&#146;, a text upon which Oliphant discoursed in letters quoted by his biographer. Alice's family were naturally displeased at the financial arrangements, as the &#145;whole of her property was placed unreservedly in the hands&#146; of Harris  (Oliphant, 115). This was her own decision: Oliphant refused to enter into a marriage contract, insisting that his wife must retain control of her own money and do with it as she saw fit. They were married on 8 June 1872 at St George's, Hanover Square, London. In 1873 Oliphant returned to Brocton by Harris's orders, with his wife and mother, who were there employed in menial offices. Oliphant himself was directed to take part in various commercial enterprises for the benefit, apparently, of the community. He was in New York and Canada, and was occasionally sent to England. In 1874 he joined the Direct United States Cable Company, and was &#145;coaching a bill through the Dominion Legislature&#146;. He learned the secrets of commercial &#145;rings&#146;, and was kindly treated by Jay Gould, the successful American financier and railway entrepreneur. In 1876 he contributed to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> the &#145;Autobiography of a joint-stock company&#146;, revealing some mysteries of commercial jugglery. He is said to have shown much financial ability in these transactions.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Harris had migrated to Santa Rosa, near San Francisco, and taken Oliphant's wife with him. In the beginning of 1878 Oliphant went to San Francisco, to the office of J. D. Walker, a wealthy businessman of San Rafael, whose friendship he had won by an act of kindness. His purpose was to see his wife, but permission was refused, and he returned to Brocton. In the following autumn Alice Oliphant left Santa Rosa, though still under Harris's rule, and supported herself for a time, first at Vallego and then at Benicia, by keeping a school. She was warmly appreciated by the Californians, and Mrs Walker was able to see her occasionally. It seems that about this time Harris had discovered not only that the marriage was not a marriage of &#145;counterparts&#146;, but that Oliphant had a spiritual &#145;counterpart&#146; in the other world, who inspired him with rhymed communications, and was therefore an obstacle to union with his earthly wife. Oliphant's belief in these communications struck his first biographer, Margaret Oliphant, as the &#145;only sign of mental aberration&#146; she ever noticed. Meanwhile, Oliphant took up a scheme for colonizing Palestine with Jews, and early in 1879 went to the East to examine the country, and to endeavour to obtain a concession from the Turkish government. An account of his journey was given in <span class="italic">The Land of Gilead, with Excursions in the Lebanon</span> (1880). The approach to the Turkish government failed, and the scheme broke down. Oliphant returned to England, and there, in the early winter of 1880, he was rejoined by his wife in answer to an appeal from him: he was depressed and ill. They made a journey to Egypt in the winter, described by him in <span class="italic">The Land of Khemi: Up and Down the Middle Nile</span> (1882). An accidental difficulty at Cairo prevented them from formally making over to Harris their right in the land at Brocton.<h2>
<a name="ThebreakwithHarris"></a>The break with Harris</h2>In May 1881 Oliphant returned to America to see his mother, who was still at Brocton. He found her both ill and troubled by doubts as to the Harris creed. They went to Santa Rosa, where the sight of a &#145;valuable ring&#146; of Lady Oliphant's upon the finger of one of Harris's household staggered their faith. In spite of orders from Harris, Oliphant took his mother to a village, where she died, in the presence of her son and their kind friend Mrs Walker. Oliphant himself now became sceptical as to the prophet's inspiration, and, with the help of Mr Walker, recovered his land at Brocton by legal proceedings. Harris and his disciples took a different view of these transactions. Alice Oliphant had received a telegram from Santa Rosa during her husband's absence requesting her sanction to placing him in confinement as mentally unbalanced. This appears to have ended her allegiance to the prophet.<br>
<br>Oliphant was again in England in January 1882, and prepared the volume called <span class="italic">Traits and Travesties</span> (1882), consisting chiefly of reprints from <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>. He now took up the Palestine colonization scheme again, and travelled with his wife to Constantinople in the summer of 1882, settling for some time at Therapia. At the end of the year they moved to Haifa in the Bay of Acre, in the neighbourhood of various Jewish colonies. He wrote there his story <span class="italic">Altiora Peto</span> (1883), in the <span class="italic">Piccadilly</span> style, the name being derived from a motto of his branch of the Oliphant family. At Haifa they collected a number of sympathizers, though they did not exactly form a community. Oliphant was now regarded as a &#145;sort of head of affairs at Brocton&#146;, which was no longer in connection with Harris. Visitors from Brocton, as well as local people and Jewish immigrants, gathered around them. They built a small house at Daliyyah, on Mount Carmel, and endeavoured to carry out their ideal of life, giving expositions of their views to various enquirers. A strange book, called <span class="italic">Sympneumata, or, Evolutionary Forces Now Active in Man</span>, was written by the Oliphants in concert and, as they thought, by a kind of common inspiration. The power they called &#145;sympneuma&#146; was the faculty of superhuman vision, hearing, strength, and resistance to disease and death given to a very few beings. It was the duty of these beings to impart the sympneuma to their fellows through physical contact, thereby leading to the regeneration of the human race. Men and women would be restored to their happy condition before the fall when male and female had been joined in one being and sexual love was pure. The doctrine was too explicit for many who had previously sympathized; some were alienated in fear of social ostracism, others in disgust; others regarded it as harmless nonsense. Oliphant also wrote <span class="italic">Masollam</span> (1886), which finally rejected Harris's claim to prophetic power but was silent as to the reason why Oliphant had submitted to his domination.<br>
<br>During a trip to the Lake of Tiberias, at the end of 1886, Alice Oliphant caught a fever; she died on 2 January 1887. Oliphant believed that she soon came back to him in spirit, and sent messages through him to her friends. Her presence was thought to be shown by his strange convulsive movements. He returned to England to carry out a tour which they had planned to take together. He was much broken, though he could still often talk with his old brightness. He wrote a series of papers in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> published in 1887 as <span class="italic">Episodes in a Life of Adventure, or, Moss from a Rolling Stone</span>, which described his early career with great spirit. He also published at Haifa a description of Palestine, and <span class="italic">Fashionable Philosophy</span> (1887), a collection of various stories. In 1887 he returned to Haifa, and wrote a pamphlet called <span class="italic">The Star in the East</span>, directed towards Muslims. It is said to have made one Arab convert, who was &#145;not much credit to his leader&#146;. Oliphant returned to England and finished his last book, <span class="italic">Scientific Religion, or, The Higher Possibilities of Life</span> (1888). This professed to be the revelation of a new religion based on the power of &#145;pure&#146; sexual love, and in it he assumed the mantle of a spiritual leader. It helped to bring about him a crowd of spiritualists and people easily swayed by pseudo-philosophical pronouncements. He visited America in 1888, and returned with Rosamond Dale Owen, daughter of Robert Dale Owen, to whom he was married at Malvern on 16 August. A few days later he was seized with illness, the effects of lung cancer, at the house of his old friends, the Walkers, at Surbiton. Thence he was moved to York House, Twickenham, to be the guest of his friend Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff. His case was hopeless from the first, though he was flattered by faith in a miraculous cure. He was cheerful and even witty to the last, and died peacefully on 23 December 1888.<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>The charm of Oliphant's alert and versatile intellect and sympathetic character was recognized by a wide circle of friends. It was felt not least by those who most regretted the strange religious developments which led to the waste of his powers and his enslavement to such a prophet as Harris, whose claims extended to the ability to rid his followers of disease. Oliphant was loved for his boyish simplicity and the warmth of heart which appeared through all his illusions. Suggestions of insanity were made, but apparently without definite reasons, and Oliphant was most remarkable for his combination of two apparently inconsistent careers. Until his last years, at any rate, his religious mysticism did not disqualify him for being also a shrewd financier, a charming man of the world, and a brilliant writer.<br>
