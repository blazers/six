<span class="headword">Philipot, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1384), <span class="occ">merchant and alderman of London</span>, was probably the son of Adam Philipot of Halstow, on the Isle of Grain, whose will, proved in 1348, named his executors as his wife, Maud, and his son John Philipot. He was married before 1357 to Joan Sauneford who appears in the London husting rolls of that year, with their daughter Joan, as the owner of a tenement on Lambeth Hill. It was 1363 before Philipot himself bought property, which included a wharf, in the parish of St Michael Queenhithe.<br>
<br>By that time Philipot was a successful wool exporter, for in 1362 he was appointed a receiver of forfeited goods at Calais, while in the following year he was elected constable of the staple. In 1364 he was exporting wheat to Calais, and in 1365/6 the London particulars of customs show him exporting 326 sacks of wool. It appears that, like many other wool merchants of his generation, he established himself in the trade by exploiting both the king's abolition of London's franchise in 1351 and the temporary ban imposed in 1353 on exports of wool by Englishmen. These meant that provincial merchants could bring wool to London and sell it directly to alien exporters without first having to obtain citizenship. It is noticeable that Philipot is at first described solely as a merchant, and it is only in 1367 that he appears as a citizen of London. Although historians have always referred to him as a grocer, in 1369 and 1371 he is described in the husting rolls as a mercer. The assumption that he was a grocer rests on a spurious list of wardens which a fifteenth-century clerk of the Grocers' Company composed to fill a gap in its records, and there is no evidence that Philipot ever belonged to the Grocers' Company. His name does not appear on a contemporary list of its members, and it would seem, therefore, that he was admitted to citizenship as a mercer, although his main interest was in the wool trade.<br>
<br>This would account for the curiously independent part which Philipot seems to have played in the politics of London. Although he often acted closely with other staplers in the interests of the wool trade, he also did striking things on his own, while his support for the Calais staple almost certainly alienated him from many mercers whose commercial interests led them to demand a staple at Antwerp. He may have become a mercer because he imported some of the rich fabrics which the Italians sold at Bruges. Certainly he had early links with the court: in 1362 he was granted a wardship by the king, and in 1365 he was acting as the partner of a king's esquire in lending &pound;200; he was lending the king money in 1370, and he and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3312/', "Nicholas Brembre")</script> used their trade with the staple to transfer funds to Bruges for John of Gaunt. He acted for the earl of Arundel in the latter's moneylending activities and sold wool for him at a commission of 25 per cent. He also served the brother and children of the earl.<br>
<br>None the less, the confidence which the Londoners had in Philipot's protection of their interests is shown by his election as their member of parliament, first in 1369, twice in 1371, twice in 1377, and then in 1380, 1381, and 1383. His first election corresponded with the renewal of the war against France. Philipot was chosen to advise the king's council on how best to protect merchant shipping, while his financial acumen and probity is reflected by his being appointed in 1371 and in 1377 to supervise the raising and spending of parliamentary taxation for the war. The naval disaster off La Rochelle in 1372, which left the wool fleet unprotected, brought Philipot and Brembre together into London's politics. They were simultaneously elected sheriffs and aldermen in September 1372 with the object of galvanizing the city's government into protecting its trade. The heavy war taxation and commercial depression made the royal government hugely unpopular by 1376, and Londoners led the attack on the crown's policies in the Good Parliament. In response John of Gaunt planned the suspension of the mayoralty, and in the troubles which followed Philipot and Brembre worked to preserve London's independence and to protect the Calais staple. After the accession of Richard II Philipot was chosen to lead a delegation which sought to conciliate Gaunt, with whom he seems to have maintained good relations.<br>
<br>Philipot's relations with the leading staplers were cemented by marriage. His first wife died on 14 November 1374, and soon afterwards he married Margaret Croydon, the heir of a rich fishmonger. Both father and daughter died within a few months, and Philipot then became Brembre's brother-in-law by marrying Margaret, the daughter of the rich vintner, John Stodey. She was also the widow of the mercer and wool merchant, John Birlingham. The wealth he gained from these marriages, and from his own trade, enabled him to take a leading part with the other staplers in lending money to the crown from 1377 to 1380. By this means they purchased the restoration of the city's franchise and protected the Calais staple, which they saw as essential to their domination of the wool trade. Philipot secured his several appointments as collector of the customs largely to recover his loans to the crown.<br>
<br>The staplers' control of London's government and financial power was threatened from 1376 by John Northampton, who exploited popular discontents to pursue his personal ambitions and those of his mistery, the drapers. Philipot worked with Brembre to hold the city together. He was elected mayor in 1378 and gained wide popularity by equipping a fleet which captured the pirate John Mercer, although his success aroused the jealousy of the nobility. He also built one of two stone towers on the Thames to defend shipping, and in 1380 he provided ships for the earl of Buckingham's expedition to Brittany and rescued it financially when it lacked money. He was knighted in 1381 by the king for his part in defeating the peasants' revolt. Philipot, like most of the staplers, supported the re-election of Northampton as mayor in 1382 in the hope of appeasing the latter's patron, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. But Northampton saw Philipot's popularity, and his friendship with the leading staplers, as threats to his own power, and a charge was speedily concocted to deprive him of his aldermanry. However, the financial support Philipot gave to the bishop of Norwich's expedition to Flanders in May 1383, which was followed by a loan supported by the staplers, recovered the king's friendship and permitted his re-election to parliament that October, together with the election of Brembre as mayor.<br>
<br>Philipot died in the summer of 1384, probably in London, and was buried in the Greyfriars Church. He was survived by at least one son, John, a mercer, and a daughter, Margaret, as well as by stepchildren. His widow married another future mayor, Adam Bamme. In his will Philipot left the reversion of a considerable amount of property to be used for the benefit of the city he had served so notably.<br>
