</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Charles John</span>  (1816&#150;1897), <span class="occ">headmaster and dean of Llandaff</span>, was born on 6 August 1816 at Leicester, the second son of the Revd Edward Thomas Vaughan (1772&#150;1829), vicar of St Martin's, Leicester, and his wife, Agnes Pares, also of Leicester. The family consisted of five sons and five daughters. Vaughan was educated at Rugby School (1829&#150;34) where he was a member of the inner circle of Thomas Arnold's pupils. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1834 and, after winning a series of university prizes, he was bracketed equal with the fourth Lord Lyttelton as senior classic and chancellor's medallist in 1838. He was elected to a fellowship at Trinity in 1839 (MA 1841; DD 1845), which he vacated in 1842. He was vicar of St Martin's, Leicester, from 1841 to 1844, when he was elected headmaster of Harrow School after having been an unsuccessful candidate for Rugby when Arnold died in 1842. Vaughan took over a school which was in very poor shape. In fifteen years he transformed its fortunes and won it a position among the leading public schools. When he arrived, there were about seventy boys; when he left, about four hundred and sixty. While at Harrow, in 1850, he married Catherine Maria Stanley (1821&#150;1899), sister of a former Rugby schoolfellow, A. P. Stanley.<br>
<br>Vaughan was a good scholar, albeit on rather narrow lines, and a strong disciplinarian. He favoured a monitorial system on the Rugby pattern, and defended this in a pamphlet (1853) when there had been publicity over a case in which a boy had been severely beaten by a monitor. During his time the school chapel was rebuilt, and his sermons and religious teaching exerted a strong influence. He appointed able men to the staff, was highly regarded by his colleagues, and remained in friendly contact with many of them long after he had left Harrow. Unlike most Victorian headmasters, Vaughan, with his wife, took a strong interest in local affairs. He was the first chairman of the Harrow local board, and he did something to meet the complaints of the parishioners about their exclusion from the benefits of the school by founding the English Class in 1853, against the wishes of his governors, where local boys could learn Latin and English subjects at modest cost. This later grew into the lower school of John Lyon.<br>
<br>Many of Vaughan's old boys spoke of him very warmly, but as one of them wrote, &#145;There was an element of inscrutability about him &hellip; He found it convenient to see through others without being seen through himself&#146;  (L. A. Tollemache, <span class="italic">Old and Odd Memories</span>, 1908, 119). Vaughan resigned his headmastership in 1859. Since the publication of Phyllis Grosskurth's biography of John Addington Symonds (1964) and of her edition of Symonds's memoirs (1984), it has been generally accepted that Vaughan resigned as the result of pressure from Symonds's father, Dr Symonds, who had been told by his son (a former Harrovian) that the headmaster had sent &#145;a series of passionate letters&#146; to another boy who was a fellow monitor. When Dr Symonds learned about the letters, he insisted, it is said, that if exposure were to be avoided, Vaughan should resign and should not accept any higher preferment in the church. <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary states that Vaughan had been offered two bishoprics. In 1860 the prime minister, Palmerston, who was also chairman of the Harrow governors, offered him the see of Rochester. Vaughan accepted it, and then withdrew a few days later. According to J. A. Symonds (though he dates these events to 1863), this withdrawal had been enforced by Dr Symonds. The story presents many difficulties: on the one hand Vaughan certainly withdrew his acceptance of the see and, when he died, he directed that no biography should be written; on the other hand the dates are discrepant and there is no evidence other than J. A. Symonds's statements. He himself was not the recipient of the letters and at the time of the alleged events he was in a highly excited mental state as he strove to come to terms with his own homosexuality. His credibility as a witness must be considered in relation to all these pressures. It seems impossible to go beyond a &#145;not proven&#146; verdict; but in 1862 Vaughan was offered and refused another (unspecified) high office.<br>
<br>In 1860 Vaughan was appointed vicar of Doncaster, where he threw himself with great energy and success into the work of a large town parish. He was on excellent terms with the corporation, he behaved with courage during a cholera epidemic, and, in a setting very different from that of Harrow, he accomplished a good deal for education, playing a major part in resuscitating the town's moribund grammar school, which was re-opened in 1862. Only a few years later the Taunton commission described it as one of the leading grammar schools in Yorkshire. When he left Doncaster in 1869 the local press was full of tributes which were clearly much more than conventional. He had, it was said, &#145;laboured and helped with a generosity unexampled for the spiritual and temporal benefit of his parishioners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Doncaster, Nottingham, and Lincoln Gazette</span>, 10 Sept 1869).<br>
<br>It was at Doncaster that Vaughan began what was to be the most important work of his later life&#151;the preparing of young men for ordination. He had announced his intention to receive young graduates in a Cambridge University sermon in 1861, and by the time he left Doncaster, 120 of the so-called &#145;doves&#146; had been trained by him, 100 of whom came to the town from all over the country for special services. Vaughan was master of the Temple from 1869 to 1894, combining this from 1879 with the deanery of Llandaff, which he held until he died. In London he developed the considerable reputation as a preacher which he had gained at Harrow and at Doncaster. His published work consisted largely of sermons and of commentaries on some of the epistles, and he was a member of the committee which produced the <span class="roman">Revised New Testament</span>. The training of the &#145;doves&#146; continued almost until the end of his life; in all some 450 men passed through his hands. Two of them, Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury from 1903 to 1928, and the Cambridge medievalist G. G. Coulton, have left accounts of their training. Vaughan concentrated on the detailed study of the <span class="roman">Greek Testament</span> and on regular sermon preparation, while all the men did regular parish work under a local clergyman. Both Coulton and Davidson commented on the absence of party spirit and the encouragement to men to form their own opinions.<br>
<br>At Llandaff, Vaughan became a major figure in Welsh life. He was much respected by nonconformists and co-operated with men of all opinions. In 1880 he re-founded the cathedral school, which his bishop called &#145;the Dean's favourite child&#146;. He played an important part in the foundation of the university college in 1883, and was one of the two representatives sent to plead the case before the arbitrators that the new south Wales college should be located in Cardiff. He was a steady friend and supporter of the first principal, John Viriamu Jones, and he was president of the college in 1894&#150;6. At this time his health broke down. He suffered from bronchitis and paralysis and he steadily weakened until he died on 15 October 1897, at the deanery, Llandaff. In its obituary, the <span class="italic">Cardiff Times</span> wrote that &#145;in his death the whole Principality has lost a friend&#146;. When he was buried in the cathedral precincts on 20 October, his funeral was attended by a very large concourse of mourners which included a formal delegation of the local nonconformist ministers and nearly half of all the students he had prepared for ordination.<br>
