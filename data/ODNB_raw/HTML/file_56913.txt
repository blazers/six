<span class="headword">Wilson,  John Robinson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>John Rowan Wilson]</span>  (1919&#150;1973), <span class="occ">surgeon and author</span>, was born at 31A Ellers Road, Leeds, on 19 November 1919, the son of John Cooke Wilson, wholesale butcher, and his wife, Lilian (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson). Wilson was educated at Stonyhurst College and Leeds University. He graduated in medicine in 1943 and worked briefly at hospitals in Leeds and Sheffield before joining the merchant service as a ship's surgeon. He spent two years with the Orient Line before returning to Leeds for surgical training. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1951 and spent two further years working as a trainee surgeon in London.<br>
<br>In 1954 Wilson changed direction in his career by joining the staff of the international pharmaceutical company Lederle Laboratories; he became its British medical director in 1958. Wilson's eight years with the company gave him the opportunity to travel widely, and he also became familiar with the workings of major multinational business concerns and with the realities of scientific research&#151;two themes that were prominent in his writing.<br>
<br>Wilson's first novel, <span class="italic">A Bed of Thorns</span>, was published in 1953, and from that time on he published a book every two or three years. All but one were works of fiction, the exception being <span class="italic">Margin of Safety</span> (1963), an account of the development of the polio vaccines. Thirty years later this was still being quoted as an authoritative source and it remains an outstanding example of science writing for general readers.<br>
<br>In 1960 Wilson moved to 32 South Eaton Place in Belgravia, London, where he lived for the rest of his life with his wife, Sheila. They had no children. In 1962 Wilson became an assistant editor on the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>. Shortly afterwards he began to write regularly for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and in 1965 he left the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, giving as his reason his wish to be able to devote more time to writing. In fact Wilson's time at the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> had not been entirely happy; his own fictionalized account appeared in 1968 in <span class="italic">The Side of the Angels</span>, which was set in a research institute deep within the Soviet Union but with a director, Suvorin, who was closely modelled on the then editor of the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, Hugh Clegg. <span class="italic">BMJ</span> staff also provided models for four of Suvorin's senior colleagues, including one whose actual suicide was mirrored in the book.<br>
<br>Wilson next became part-time international editor of <span class="italic">World Medicine</span>. In the late 1960s and 1970s this fortnightly magazine entertained and stimulated doctors by its outspoken criticism of the pomposities and arrogance of the leaders of the medical profession. Wilson was a fine exponent of deflating criticism, but he was careful to avoid the trap for campaigning journalists of believing in conspiracies. One of his favourite aphorisms was that &#145;when treated badly always suspect inefficiency rather than malice&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1971 Wilson joined his former colleague Hugh Clegg in editing a journal for doctors in developing countries, <span class="italic">Tropical Doctor</span>, and he became sole editor in 1972. He continued to publish novels; his last, <span class="italic">Barrington</span> (1971), which was a reworking of the story of Albert Schweitzer, was thought by some critics to be his best work of fiction. Wilson died suddenly in Orga, Kyrenia, Cyprus, on 23 May 1973. He was survived by his wife.<br>
