</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Evans, Sir  Geraint Llewellyn</span>  (1922&#150;1992), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 16 February 1922 at 55 William Street, Cilfynydd, Glamorgan, the only son of William John Evans (1899&#150;1978), miner, and his wife, Charlotte May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1901&#150;1923). His mother died in childbirth when her son was seventeen months old, and the daughter she then bore did not long survive her. His father thereupon returned to live with his own parents, and Evans was brought up by his maternal grandparents in Cilfynydd. The family was Welsh speaking, and Welsh was Evans's first language before he learned English. He was aged ten when his father remarried, and the boy moved with his father and stepmother to Hopkinstown, in the Rhondda valley. He attended local schools and Lan Wood School, Pontypridd, until the age of fourteen, when he returned to live with his grandparents and took his first job as a shop assistant and window-dresser in nearby Pontypridd.<br>
<br>On his afternoons off Evans began taking singing lessons in Cardiff, sang with the Bethel Methodist Chapel choir in Cilfynydd (he remained a Methodist all his life), appeared in <span class="italic">Lilac Time</span> with a local dramatic society, made his first solo broadcast for BBC Wales, aged seventeen, and took the title role in a Bethel Chapel costumed performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio <span class="italic">Elijah</span>. He followed the local trend as a keen enthusiast for rugby football, but was prevented from active participation by the asthma from which he suffered when young. On the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered for the Royal Air Force and was trained as a radio mechanic, serving in France, Belgium, and Germany, and taking part in forces entertainments at home and abroad. At the war's end he was posted to British Forces Network, broadcasting from Hamburg, where he sang regularly with the radio chorus and began professional vocal training with the lieder singer Theo Herrmann, a Viennese baritone of distinction then resident in Hamburg.<br>
<br>On demobilization Evans took a gamble in deciding to pursue a singing career, and a reluctant local authority was persuaded to give him a serviceman's vocational grant to attend London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama. There he made his operatic d&eacute;but in 1948 as Don Alfonso in a student production of Mozart's <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span>. After a successful audition at Covent Garden he was engaged as principal baritone at &pound;12 per week. On the prospects of a regular income he proposed to Brenda Evans Davies (<i>b</i>. 1920), a neighbour and schoolteacher from Cilfynydd, and they were married on 27 March 1948 at Moriah Chapel, Cilfynydd. Their marriage remained steadfast until his death, and they had two sons, Alun and Huw. His wife was a constant source of strength and support throughout his career, giving perceptive criticism when she thought it was needed.<br>
<br>Evans made his d&eacute;but with the Covent Garden Opera on 21 January 1948 in the brief but exposed role of the Nightwatchman in <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg</span>, the first Wagner production there since the war. A decade later he had progressed to Beckmesser, the crotchety town clerk in the same opera, which became one of the half-dozen roles most closely associated with him, of the seventy-three roles in fifty-three operas which he performed in his career. Before this he had already launched a Figaro at Covent Garden that proved ideally suited to his voice and personality, and which he would sing more than 500 times around the world. Together with his seedy Leporello in <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> and his happy-go-lucky Papageno in <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span>, this formed part of a trilogy of Mozart roles that always showed to advantage his sense of musical style and his talent for stage character.<br>
<br>Evans acknowledged that he preferred the opera stage to the concert platform, the physical process of costume and make-up enabling him to take on another identity altogether. In search of a convincing portrait he would sometimes invent for himself backgrounds to the characters he sang, and these were always built &#145;from the feet up&#146;. His Mozart characters were polished at the Glyndebourne Festival in Sussex, where he sang at ten annual festivals, from 1950 to 1959, and where, in 1957, he first assumed the title role in Verdi's <span class="italic">Falstaff</span>, a role that was to bring him lasting fame and launch him on more than two decades of international travel.<br>
<br>Evans's engagements abroad included an unprecedented twenty-four consecutive annual seasons at San Francisco, for which he received the San Francisco Opera medal acknowledging his &#145;exceptional contributions&#146;; the Vienna Staatsoper, where he was invited to join the resident company by the conductor Herbert von Karajan, but chose instead to remain at Covent Garden; the Chicago Lyric Opera, for several seasons from 1961; and La Scala, Milan, where the stage crew in 1960, puzzled by his fluent if Welsh-inflected Italian as Figaro and his strange name, decided he must be Sicilian  (Evans, 149). The Salzburg Festival also engaged him for nine consecutive years. His d&eacute;but role was, inevitably, Figaro, which had never previously been sung at Salzburg by anybody from Britain, so he felt not a little insulted that a BBC television crew, sent there to make a documentary feature, interviewed his co-stars and ignored him completely  (ibid., 164). Ignoring the achievements of British singers abroad was, he found, endemic in the attitude of British officialdom. He would frequently be invited to receptions given for their singers by the German, Austrian, French, Polish, and other embassies, but he was able to reciprocate only &#145;a couple of times&#146; at the British embassy. Yet he made sure that, whenever possible, he put in a good word abroad for fellow singers he knew in Britain (especially if they were Welsh), to a point where Britain's international operatic prestige had never been higher.<br>
<br>At home Evans felt privileged to work with Benjamin Britten, creating roles in the premi&egrave;res of <span class="italic">Billy Budd</span> and the coronation opera, <span class="italic">Gloriana</span>, as well as singing in other operas including <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> and a ripely seasoned Bottom in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> and <span class="italic">Billy Budd</span> were two of his first choices when he was invited to direct his own productions in the USA, where he also directed <span class="italic">Falstaff</span>, <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span>, and <span class="italic">Don Pasquale</span>, and he harboured some regret that more was not made of his experience in this way among British companies. Much of his professional success was due to his sense of ensemble, of being part of a team working together in a combined artistic endeavour rather than in individual rivalry. Late in his career he appeared with both the Welsh National Opera and the Scottish Opera to sing several of his best loved roles, and added new roles in operas composed for him by Norman Kay and the Welsh composer Alun Hoddinott. He felt some disappointment that more use of his great talent was not made for recording purposes, although he recorded his &#145;signature role&#146; of Figaro under both Otto Klemperer and Daniel Barenboim, Falstaff under Georg Solti, <span class="italic">Die Meistersinger</span> with Herbert von Karajan, and <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> with Britten.<br>
<br>Evans made his farewell appearance at Covent Garden on 4 June 1984 as the quack Doctor Dulcamara in Donizetti's <span class="italic">L'elisir d'amore</span>, chosen so he could offer the doctor's supposed &#145;love-potion&#146; all around as a token of thanks to fellow artists and audiences alike. In retirement at Trelawney, the harbourside house at Aberaeron, Cardiganshire, bought as a holiday home in 1966, he was occupied with programmes for Harlech Television, including master classes and occasional coaching. He was appointed CBE in 1959, was knighted in 1969, and, besides various academic fellowships, became a freeman of the City of London in 1984. He died of a heart attack at Aberystwyth on 19 September 1992 and, after cremation, his ashes were interred at the church of Llanddewi Aber-arth, near Aberaeron, on 11 November. He was commemorated by a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey, London, on 27 November that year, for the life of a great artist and a lovable man.<br>
