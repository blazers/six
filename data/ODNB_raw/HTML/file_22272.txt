<span class="headword">Pilkington,  William</span>  (1758&#150;1848), <span class="occ">surveyor and architect</span>, was born on 7 September 1758 at Hatfield, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, the elder son of William Pilkington (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1720&#150;<i>c</i>.1765), jockey, of Hatfield, and his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1730&#150;<i>c</i>.1760), daughter of William Barker of Tadcaster. Educated at Charterhouse, about 1777 he joined Sir Robert Taylor, the architect, as a pupil, remaining as his assistant until Taylor's death. He succeeded him as surveyor to the duke of Grafton's London estate, building a house in Half Moon Street in 1798. Pilkington was also surveyor to the board of customs from 1781 to 1810 (building custom houses at Portsmouth, 1785, dem., and Liverpool, enlargement 1786, dem. 1828); district surveyor to the parishes of St Margaret and St John in Westminster from 1784; and surveyor to the Sun Fire Assurance office from 1792, and the Charterhouse from 1792, where he rebuilt Big School in 1803 (dem. <i>c</i>.1872). For the earl of Radnor he built the council house at Salisbury (1788&#150;97) from Taylor's designs, and the gaol at Folkestone.<br>
<br>Pilkington's most important works, however, were the transport office in Cannon Row, Westminster (1816), later the India Board of Control, and the monumental Naval Hospital at Great Yarmouth (<i>c</i>.1798&#150;1811), which consisted of four brick blocks with Roman Doric porticos (converted into flats, 1996&#150;7). He occasionally exhibited designs at the Royal Academy, from 1780 to 1790. In 1819 he sought employment from the new church building commission. Pilkington retired about 1842 to his property at Hatfield, where he resided as a landed gentleman, claiming direct male descent from a companion of William the Conqueror. He died there on 18 August 1848. He had married, on 16 June 1785, at St George's, Hanover Square, Sarah (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1765&#150;<i>c</i>.1827), daughter and coheir of John Andrews of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, with whom he had two sons. One was Henry Pilkington of Park Lane House, near Doncaster, a barrister and an assistant poor-law and tithe commissioner.<br>
<br>Pilkington's second son, <a name="cosubject_22277"></a><span class="headword">Redmond William Pilkington</span>  (1789&#150;1844), also an <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 9 July 1789. Educated at Charterhouse, he then followed his father's profession as surveyor and architect, and succeeded him in some of his posts, including those connected with Lord Radnor (1826), the Sun Fire Assurance office (1838), and the Charterhouse (1824). At the Charterhouse he rebuilt Preacher's and Pensioner's courts, apparently to Edward Blore's designs, though he exhibited a view of one quadrangle at the Royal Academy in 1827 under his own name. Pilkington was a magistrate for Middlesex and lived in Hyde Park Gate, Kensington Gore. He married, on 7 July 1827, Frances (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1810&#150;<i>c</i>.1875), daughter of Thomas Adams of Belgrave Place, London, with whom he had one son, <a href="#cosubject_22272">Lionel Scott [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He supported his brother's family, and purchased an estate, Ash Hill, near his father's property at Doncaster, where he resided occasionally; he died there on 22 May 1844.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22272"></a><span class="headword">Lionel Scott Pilkington</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Jack Hawley]</span>  (1830&#150;1875), <span class="occ">sportsman and eccentric</span>, was born on 5 May 1830. Entered at Rugby in 1844, he was soon expelled for his nightly expeditions to pubs. Pilkington early in life developed a strong love of stable life and habitually dressed as a groom. Travelling in Italy with a tutor, he ran away and was found working in the duke of Parma's stables; subsequently he served as a seaman on an India merchantman. He served Sir Joseph Henry Hawley as groom, and, being known in the stables as Jack, he adopted the surname of Hawley. When he came of age, he sold part of his father's property and built a house in Hatfield, living there all his life. In appearance he was &#145;short, strongly built, dark, and very round-shouldered&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life and Eccentricities</span>, 9). Well-read despite his addictions to stables, racecourses, fox-hunting, and labouring on his farm, he was overpoweringly hospitable to his acquaintances. A Roman Catholic, he was violently hostile to church rates and other manifestations of the Church of England. He claimed to have married in Italy and had three children. Hard drinking shortened his days and he died on Christmas day 1875 at Hatfield. He insisted that he be buried there, fully dressed in his riding clothes, in a stone coffin alongside his favourite horse in a paddock in which his rinderpest-infested stock had been interred. He left his Yorkshire property to his groom.<br>
