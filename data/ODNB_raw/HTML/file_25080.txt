<span class="headword">Semple,  James George</span>  (1759&#150;1815), <span class="occ">adventurer</span>, who also passed under the names Semple-Lisle, Maxwell, Harrod, and Grant, was born at Irvine, Ayrshire. He was the son of James Semple, formerly an exciseman, who eventually laid claim to the extinct title of Viscount Lisle. In 1776 he was serving in America, where he was taken prisoner, but was released in 1777 and returned to England. He then became involved with the novelist Mrs Eliza Gooch. Marrying a goddaughter of the notorious Elizabeth Chudleigh, duchess of Kingston, he accompanied the latter to the continent. There he claims to have accompanied Frederick the Great during his campaign of 1778, to have been introduced to the Empress Catherine of Russia, to have accompanied Prince Potyomkin to the Crimea, and to have designed a uniform for the Russian army. Upon returning to England in 1784 he was arrested for obtaining goods by false pretences, and on 2 September 1786 was sentenced to seven years' transportation. Released on condition of quitting England, he moved to Paris, where he passed himself off as a member of General Berruyer's staff, and as witnessing in that capacity the execution of Louis XVI. He returned to England in time to avoid arrest, and on 18 February 1795 was again sentenced to transportation, this time for defrauding tradesmen. Disappointed in his hopes of pardon, he stabbed himself in Newgate in December 1796, when about to be shipped for Botany Bay, and subsequently tried to starve himself to death. He recovered, and in 1797 was dispatched in the <i>Lady Shore</i> bound for Australia. On 21 August 1797 a mutiny broke out, the captain having disregarded Semple's warning of impending riot. Semple, with several others, was allowed to leave the ship in a boat. He eventually landed in South America, and, after many adventures, reached Tangier, where he surrendered, and was sent back to England. He was committed to Tothill Fields prison, and at the time of publishing his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Life of Major J. G. Semple-Lisle</span>, in 1799, was still confined there. He was not re-transported, and in October 1804 was living in London, where he wrote to the government from his publisher's house in Piccadilly, offering his services as a spy. In June 1807 he appeared at Worship Street public office, charged with defrauding two females, but was acquitted on a technicality. In December 1814 he was found guilty at the Middlesex sessions of obtaining two pieces of bacon and some butter by fraudulent means, and was sentenced, for the third time in his life, to seven years' transportation. When the prince regent lifted this sentence passed on him he undertook to move to Morocco, and he died on his way there, at Lisbon on 18 November 1815  (<span class="italic">Hull Packet</span>, 19 Dec 1815).<br>
