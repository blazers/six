<span class="headword">Hirst,  Paul Quentin</span>  (1946&#150;2003), <span class="occ">social and political theorist</span>, was born on 20 May 1946 at the maternity home, Holberton, Devon, the son of Henry (Harry) Hirst, a fitter in the motor trade and later a manager at the royal dockyard, Plymouth, and his non-practising Jewish wife, Joyce Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schaffer. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 6 Chapel Way, Lower Compton, Plymouth. His father subsequently rose through the ranks to become an officer in the RAF, so much of his childhood was spent on the move in Germany in military schools and in different schools in England. His last school was the grammar school in Plymouth, where his parents resettled. If his early education was disrupted, it drove him to read widely on his own. When his family suggested he enter the motor trade&#151;an uncle owned garages&#151;he was prompted to find a place to study sociology at Leicester University. He must have known what he was doing because for a time Leicester was the best place in the country for theory-driven, critical sociology, led by the Russian-born, Belgian-educated Ilya Neustadt, and the German refugee, Norbert Elias. Elsewhere British sociology was in the main parochial and empirical, often hardly distinguishable from social administration. His teachers, including the young lecturer Sami Zubaida, a Marxist Middle East specialist, believed that sociology had a mission to change the world. Hirst was a leading activist in the student politics of that time. After taking a first-class degree, he went to Sussex University in 1968 to study for an MA under Tom Bottomore, a Marxist of moderate persuasion, less hostile to relevant empirical investigation.<br>
<br>In 1969 Hirst was appointed a lecturer in sociology at Birkbeck College, London, through the persuasion of Sami Zubaida, who had moved there the year before. They both loved the company of the mature evening students who attended the college, but were less than happy to be attached for subsidiary teaching, as if a kind of violent yeast, to the psychology department, doggedly empirical and behavioural. Hirst was a brilliant and demotic teacher, speaking the language of most of the students. He had a tic of ending every assertion, almost every sentence, with either an interrogative or a demonstrative, &#145;Right?!&#146;. Already a small group had gathered around him, half disciples and half combative colleagues, associated at first with a new journal, <span class="italic">Theoretical Practice</span>, to study the work of Althusser and Michel Foucault. In 1973 Bernard Crick was invited to take up a new, free-floating chair of politics at Birkbeck, but was readily persuaded to rescue Hirst and Zubaida from what the then master called &#145;their Babylonian captivity&#146;, to form a small postgraduate department of politics and sociology. Agreeing a curriculum could have been an ideological battle. But Hirst's tolerance and good humour were remarkable. A live-and-let-live concordat was readily achieved. The students got both critical Marxism and bourgeois civic republicanism. External examiners found this difficult but the two polarities stretched the students. They had to be both serious and empathetic.<br>
<br>Hirst's <span class="italic">Pre-Capitalist Modes of Production</span> was published in 1975 and <span class="italic">Marx's Capital and Capitalism Today</span> followed in 1978, both jointly authored out of the Althusserian study group which was contesting the idea of historical materialism as the core of Marxist intellectual practice rather than high theory. This was a <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i> among the intellectual Marxisante left, leading to fierce polemics with leading writers of the <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>, whom he regarded, as Ben Pimlott said, &#145;as a clique of Trotskyite public schoolboys&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 20 June 2003). To discuss the ideas of Althusserian theory Hirst had a private seminar as well as the curricular one on Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. One of his most remarkable collaborations followed his meeting in 1976 with Penelope Ann Franklin (Penny) Woolley (<i>b</i>. 1939), sociologist. (She was the daughter of Alexander John Woolley, schoolteacher; they married on 16 February 1980, and had one son, Jamie.) To interest psychology students in anything but measurement he had devised a highly innovative course on the relation of the social to the biological. Penny at Hatfield Polytechnic had found a similar solution to the same problem. So together they wrote <span class="italic">Social Relations and Human Attributes</span> in 1982. Traces of Althusser and Foucault remained, especially in rejecting Mill's and Popper's &#145;methodological individualism&#146; as a starting point. But by the end of the 1970s it became clear that much of the study of Althusser had turned from agreement with the stance of high theory rejecting history, or rather being the only way of interpreting history, into a more balanced view of theory and practice: theory must interpret the world but the world is a construct of empirical scientific knowledge.<br>
<br>When in 1985 Hirst was appointed to a chair of social theory at Birkbeck he gave his inaugural lecture on democracy. His colleagues waited for some new intellectual formulation but there followed a sturdy, commonsense reimagining of the liberal theory and practice of representative government. He had reinvented the wheel, reasoning away as if to proclaim a new discovery&#151;but for himself it was. Colleagues joked that he had turned from Karl Marx into Sidney Webb almost overnight. He became a familiar figure at Fabian Society meetings and active in Charter 88, as vice-chair and then chair (1998&#150;2003). He rediscovered and updated the pluralism of J. N. Figgis, Harold Laski, and G. D. H. Cole, notably in <span class="italic">Associative Democracy: New Forms of Economic and Social Governance</span> (1994). He dedicated it to his son Jamie, deliberately to mark faith in progress and a better future. Many saw it that way, both Marxists coming down to earth and also social democrats looking for a successor to Tony Crosland's <span class="italic">The Future of Socialism</span> of 1956. His last position is best found in <span class="italic">After Thatcher</span> (1989), calling for a &#145;third way&#146; between a purely pragmatic politics on the left and those who still refused any compromise with a centrist social democratic state. But the shallowness of the Blairite &#145;third way&#146; soon earned his contempt, both politically and intellectually.<br>
<br>In all Hirst was main author of eighteen books and hundreds of articles, reviews, and lectures on a remarkable range of subjects in a remarkable range of journals. They all had one thing in common. In &#145;The future of political studies&#146; (published in <span class="italic">European Political Science</span> in 2003) he wrote, &#145;To be engaged and try to be objective is tough, but it is the only serious stance.&#146; That was true of both his Marxist and his social-democratic writings. He was a man who never stopped thinking afresh and tackling new problems, a great teacher, and to students and colleagues a friendly, humorous man of Falstaffian girth, with an appetite for good food and wine. He died at Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, on 16 June 2003, following a stroke and brain haemorrhage. His donor card was honoured that same day to save the life of another. He was survived by his wife, Penny, and son, Jamie.<br>
