<span class="headword">Barnes, Sir  Thomas James</span>  (1888&#150;1964), <span class="occ">lawyer and public official</span>, was born on 21 March 1888 at Wilmslow, Cheshire, the only son of Thomas Barnes and his wife, Esther Mary Pither. His father was a clerk attached to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. After education at Mercers' School, Barnes was articled for five years to Robert John Ball, a partner in the firm of H. C. Coote and Ball, solicitors in the City of London, which specialized in shipping matters. He was admitted a solicitor in 1911. He did not take out a practising certificate, but just before his admission he followed his father into the Lord Chancellor's Department. He joined as a temporary clerk and later became a principal clerk in the Chancery registrars' office. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1914 he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He became a chief petty officer in 1915 and sub-lieutenant in 1916, serving in the Dover patrol. His ship was blown up in 1916 and as a result of this experience he developed a lasting form of neurosis and was discharged in May 1917. In the following month he was lent by the Lord Chancellor's Department to the Ministry of Shipping legal adviser's department and within two years he had become the legal adviser. In 1920 he was appointed solicitor to the Board of Trade at the early age of thirty-two.<br>
<br>In 1934 Barnes was appointed procurator-general and Treasury solicitor, a position which he retained for nearly twenty years. He was the first solicitor ever to be appointed to these offices and he proved to be the outstanding government lawyer of his generation. During his time there was an enormous increase in the work of his office. At the beginning of the war new departments were set up for which the Treasury solicitor acted; many of them remained for the rest of his term of office.<br>
<br>As a general rule Barnes was content to let his staff get on with their allotted work with the minimum of supervision. He did, however, take personal and active charge over a number of matters of special importance and difficulty. He directed a number of inquiries under the <span class="roman">Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act</span>, 1921, the best-known being the budget leak in 1936 and the Lynskey tribunal in 1948. During the war he was particularly successful in settling difficult problems of compensation arising from the requisitioning of land and other property by the armed forces and government departments. Towards the end of the war he was actively concerned in the arrangements for setting up the Nuremberg tribunal to try the major war criminals.<br>
<br>Barnes had always been a formidable champion of the crown's position in the courts, but after the war he played a leading part in the <span class="roman">Crown Proceedings Act</span>, 1947, which made the crown liable to all the ordinary forms of action. The proposals for this reform had languished for twenty years or more, but he realized that the time had arrived for a big step forward, and he threw himself wholeheartedly into preparing the legislation, and later into making it work smoothly.<br>
<br>While Treasury solicitor, Barnes served on a number of important committees, including the Evershed committee on Supreme Court practice and procedure (1947&#150;53). To all these problems he brought a lively intelligence. He worked very quickly and had an astonishing resourcefulness in solving intractable problems. He never dwelt on difficulties, but turned his acute and practical mind to the task of finding a solution. He had a real talent for negotiation. He always disclaimed an academic knowledge of the law, but he had an extremely tenacious memory and acquired a fund of legal wisdom and experience which was always available and to the point. It was a delight to work with him. He was always accessible and informal. If a colleague brought him a problem, he would listen intently, pick up the problem quickly, and then make some helpful suggestions, often referring to a precedent in the office or to some decided case which on examination proved to be exactly apposite. It was all done quickly and decisively and with charm and humour. He generously encouraged others. He had a good political sense and his advice was essentially practical. All these qualities endeared him to the ministers and departmental officials for whom he worked, and to his own staff.<br>
<br>Barnes retired in 1953 and became a part-time director of the Prudential Assurance Company. But the work did not appeal to him and he soon resigned. In 1954 he joined the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission and remained a member until the end of 1959, when he retired on the grounds of ill health. While Treasury solicitor he had frequently been called on to advise on ecclesiastical matters. After his retirement, right up to the time of his death, he took a leading part in revising the canon law of the Church of England.<br>
<br>Barnes's main recreation was golf, which he much enjoyed. He had been brought up at Sunningdale, and for most of his life he was a leading member of Sunningdale and Swinley Forest golf clubs. Between the wars he played to a single-figure handicap, and was a difficult man to beat.<br>
<br>On 24 May 1924 Barnes married Elsie Margaret Clover, a widow, daughter of John Alexander, formerly chief clerk of Bow Street police court; they had no children. He was knighted in 1927, appointed KCB in 1938, and promoted GCB in 1948. He died at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on 4 February 1964 and his widow later in the same year.<br>
