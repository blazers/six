<span class="headword">Dewsbury,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1621&#150;1688), <span class="occ">Quaker activist</span>, was born and raised in Allerthorpe, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Of his father and mother nothing is known, beyond the speculation by Smith that William's father died when he was eight years old. Dewsbury's upbringing, working life, and religious experiences are discussed in his <span class="italic">Discovery of the Great Enmity of the Serpent</span> (1655). His first job as a shepherd afforded him the time to think about God, but he clearly felt isolated. When the time came for him to be apprenticed, therefore, he asked his parents to send him to Leeds so that he could move among &#145;those that feared the living God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discovery</span>, 14). He gave up his apprenticeship (to a clothier) in the early 1640s, when he briefly joined the parliamentary army. Failing to find the spiritual satisfaction he had hoped for, and believing that God was telling him to fight no longer with &#145;carnall&#146; weapons, Dewsbury subsequently drifted between different churches: the presbyterians in Scotland, the Baptists and Independents in his native England  (<span class="italic">Discovery</span>, 17). His first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1659), was a relatively prosperous woman with a history of religious dissent; the couple apparently married at a Baptist meeting in the 1640s. At home again in Yorkshire, but anxious and disillusioned, Dewsbury continued to feel that he was unregenerate, and though Quakerism seems to have given him a sense of purpose, his Calvinistic sense of having been &#145;conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity&#146; seems never to have fully left him  (<span class="italic">Discovery</span>, 12). However, he immediately converted to Quakerism in 1651, and he began his ministry in October 1652. Like William, Anne was converted to the Quaker way by George Fox, who remembered her in his contribution to <span class="italic">The Faithful Testimony of &hellip; William Dewsbery</span>, published in 1689. Anne died in October or November 1659, having given birth to at least three children.<br>
<br>Dewsbury was fully committed to advancing the Quaker cause throughout England and Scotland, even though this drew him into dangerous situations. Almost every account seems to confirm that Dewsbury had a natural authority and spirited obduracy, qualities that were antithetical to non-Quakers. Before being imprisoned in York in 1654, Dewsbury had provoked, through his &#145;plaine &amp; powerful&#146; sermons, many people's conversion to Quakerism  (Penney, <span class="italic">First Publishers</span>, 197). Thomas Thompson's view of Dewsbury's ministry&#151;&#145;I had never heard nor felt the like before&#146;  (Thompson, 17)&#151;was perhaps the experience of many Quakers, and it was probably his charisma that made him so dangerous to the authorities, who imprisoned him in York (1654, 1660, 1663), Northamptonshire (1654), Exeter (1657), London (1662), and Warwick (1664, 1679). Indeed, in <span class="italic">The Second Period of Quakerism</span>, William Braithwaite observed that Dewsbury &#145;may be described as passing his life in prison with brief intervals of freedom&#146;  (p. 221). Inevitably, any account of his life is principally a description of incarceration.<br>
<br>The first charges against Dewsbury show the suspicion in which he was held, with authorities regarding him as an enemy of the social order. In York, accused of &#145;seducing the people&#146;, Dewsbury was criticized for allegedly equating himself with Christ  (<span class="italic">The Discovery of the Great Enmity of the Serpent</span>, 7). In Northampton, the import of Dewsbury's prophecies led to a blasphemy trial and fifteen months' imprisonment. Similarly, in Exeter, Dewsbury was accused of being a Jesuit, though the judge recognized the spuriousness of this charge, and tore up the <i>mittimus</i>. In 1661&#150;2 he was barely out of prison (suffering in York and London), and in July 1662 he was taken by the authorities from his home in Durteen, Yorkshire. Dewsbury's early incarcerations, though, were nothing in comparison to his experiences at Warwick. Imprisoned in 1664 for <i>praemunire</i>, he was not released until 1672 under the general pardon; during his imprisonment, most probably in 1667, he married a Warwickshire woman called Alice Reads or Meads. When English politics became dominated by fears of a Catholic insurrection from 1678 onwards, Dewsbury was again arrested despite the fact that Titus Oates cleared him of being involved. Dewsbury was probably released under the general pardon of March 1686.<br>
<br>A few months before his death, Dewsbury visited London, where he delivered a final sermon, later published as <span class="italic">A Sermon on the Important Doctrine of Regeneration</span>. The sense of conflict between the godly and the ungodly, couched in Calvinistic language, emerges in this unrepentant address. Dewsbury then returned to Warwickshire weakened by what John Whiting describes as &#145;his old Distemper he had contracted in Prison&#146;  (Whiting, 182). Clearly, Dewsbury had withstood persecution by still looking towards a new millennium: &#145;a Dreadful terrible Day is at hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Faithful Testimony</span>, sig. a3<i>r</i>). Dewsbury died in Warwick on 17 June 1688, and was buried there the following day: he was aged about sixty-seven. Nothing further is known of his second wife, but William probably predeceased her. He certainly had two children who lived to seniority, one of which was Mary, the wife of John Sam, while Jone [<i>sic</i>] Dewsbury was either William's daughter or daughter-in-law. William was not principally a family man, saying: &#145;live a Married Life as if you were Unmarried&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 12).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Faithful Testimony</span> includes the words that are perhaps the best testimony to his life's work: &#145;I never since played the Coward, but joyfully entered Prisons as Palaces&#146;  (sig. a3<i>r</i>).<br>
