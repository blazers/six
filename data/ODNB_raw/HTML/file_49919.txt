<span class="headword">Pedler, Sir  Frederick Johnson</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">colonial official and businessman</span>, was born on 10 July 1908 at 27 Park Avenue South, Hornsey, London, the only child of Charles Henry Pedler (1865&#150;1935), wholesale tea merchant, and his wife, Lucy Marian 
    (May; 1878&#150;1952)
  , daughter of the Revd Simpson Johnson of Bishop Auckland. Both parents were Methodists. Pedler's earliest years were spent in Finsbury Park and Finchley, north of London, before the family moved to Watford in 1918, where Pedler attended Watford grammar school, becoming both head boy and captain of rugby. He won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1927, becoming Goldsmith's exhibitioner in 1929, and graduating in 1930 with a starred first in history. He was awarded the Schuldham plate. In later years Pedler remained a staunch supporter of both institutions, twice serving as chair of the grammar school's Old Fullerians' Association, campaigning successfully to maintain the school's academic standards during a ten-year stint as chairman of the school governors in the 1960s and 1970s, and joining the Gonville and Caius investment committee.<br>
<br>On graduating, Pedler entered the administrative grade of the civil service, drawn by the opportunity for travel in the department of his choice, the Colonial Office. It was nevertheless only after some agitation on his part that he finally secured his dispatch to Tanganyika in 1934. As assistant secretary in Dar es Salaam he produced a paper (subsequently published by the Tanganyikan government) outlining the advantages of membership of the customs union with Kenya and Uganda, and (himself an enthusiastic boy scout) helped establish the scouting movement in the colony, before serving as an assistant district officer, first in Kwimba district and then in Moshi. On 11 June 1935 he married Esther Ruth Carling (<i>b</i>. 1908), teacher, and daughter of Henry Frank Carling (1873&#150;1949) and Esther Lillie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colebrook (1870&#150;1957), of Peppard Common, Oxfordshire. They had met in 1927 when both worked for an international holiday school. The couple had three children: Robin Henry (<i>b</i>. 1937), Esther Marian (<i>b</i>. 1940), and Martin Colebrook (<i>b</i>. 1943).<br>
<br>In September 1935 the Colonial Office cut short Pedler's Tanganyikan tour. In the following years he played a supporting role in some of the most significant episodes in the development of British African policy. In 1937 he was appointed secretary to the commission of higher education in east Africa and the Sudan, chaired by Lord De La Warr, to whom he was seconded as private secretary. The same year he was employed to edit the highly influential <span class="italic">African Survey</span> (1938) following Lord Hailey's breakdown, preparing some &#145;material that was scarcely in first draft&#146;  (MSS Afr. s. 1814, FP 9/79, survey chairman to De La Warr, 22 March 1938). At the Colonial Office's insistence, Pedler's substantial contribution went unacknowledged in the published version. His association with Hailey continued when the latter requested his appointment as secretary when asked to undertake a confidential survey of native administration in British Africa. The draft of the report (the basis for the Colonial Office's 1943 sketch for west African constitutional development, and a milestone in the evolution of official thinking towards native administration policy) was prepared by Pedler as the pair toured tropical Africa. Pedler also travelled to the Belgian Congo with Hailey when the latter was appointed head of the British economic mission to the colony in 1940&#150;41, and on Hailey's departure he assumed control of the mission. The extent of Pedler's contribution to the final report is unknown (Pedler himself remained vague on this point), but the superior quality of this confidential report in comparison to a revised version Hailey published later led Hailey's biographer to speculate that it may have been considerable  (Cell, <span class="italic">Hailey</span>, 296&#150;7).<br>
<br>Pedler's experiences shaped his own relatively far-sighted views on African political development. In 1942 (in contrast to Hailey) he supported the Gold Coast governor's proposals to admit Africans to the colony's executive council. While working on the <span class="italic">Survey</span>, he had privately recorded his own disagreement with Hailey's assessment of the native authorities (Pedler placing greater weight on the problems of investing traditional rather than educated African &eacute;lites with powers of local government), and in 1946, when the Colonial Office debated their future, he wrote an influential memorandum stressing the extent of African politicization and recommending the democratization of African local government as essential to the maintenance of British African interests.<br>
<br>Pedler's next important assignment came in December 1942, when he served as chief British economic representative to French West Africa and Togoland, successfully handling the delicate negotiations between the free French, Americans, and British, to direct exports essential to the allied war effort and to handle the region's supply problems. Back in London he was promoted to head the department of finance and development, in 1944, before&#151;to his dissatisfaction&#151;he was assigned in January 1945 to assist Sir Ralph Furse in handling post-war colonial service recruitment. In January 1947, frustrated in this position, convinced (ironically in view of later developments) that, as he later recalled, Africa was &#145;a political backwater&#146; in the Colonial Office, and keen to secure &#145;a position to influence policy in Africa&#146;  (MS Afr. s. 1718), he quit the Colonial Office and, drawing on contacts established particularly during his Dakar mission, opted for a more lucrative second career with the United Africa Company (UAC).<br>
<br>In various early managerial postings in Nigeria and the Gold Coast and as an area manager in London, Pedler became a leading player in framing UAC's response to the 1947&#150;8 Gold Coast political developments. Thereafter, as UAC director (1951&#150;68), managing director (1956&#150;68), and deputy chairman (1965&#150;68), as well as director of Unilever (1956&#150;68), Pedler was a key figure in UAC's attempts via redeployment to adapt to the economic and political difficulties of operating in independent African states. During this period his friendships with various African nationalists led him into some unorthodox relationships (the future Ghanaian leader Kofi Busia corresponded with Pedler under a pseudonym during his exile), but could open doors for UAC: Pedler enjoyed famously easy access to Kwame Nkrumah. In Nigeria he was offered the vice-chancellorship of Ahmadu Bello University in October 1965, although the proposal lapsed with Sir Ahmadu Bello's murder. He retired from the United Africa Company in 1968.<br>
<br>Other activities testified to Pedler's continuing engagement with African affairs: he was chairman of the council for technical education and training for overseas countries, 1962&#150;73, chairman of the East African and Mauritius Association, 1966&#150;8, a member of the Inter-University Council, 1967&#150;73, and treasurer of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), 1969&#150;81. He was made an honorary fellow of SOAS in 1976. In 1969 he was knighted for &#145;services to technical education overseas&#146;. Fluent in Swahili and Hausa, he also published many articles on Africa, and three west African historical and geographical surveys, <span class="italic">West Africa</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Economic Geography of West Africa</span> (1955), and <span class="italic">Main Currents of West African History, 1940&#150;1978</span> (1979), which revealed disappointingly little of Pedler's own role in the region's affairs. More revealing was Pedler's personal memoir <span class="italic">Business and decolonization in West Africa, c.1940&#150;1960</span> (1989). Pedler also published a business history, <span class="italic">The lion and the unicorn in Africa: a history of the origins of the United Africa Company, 1787&#150;1931</span> (1974), as well as <span class="italic">A Pedler Family History</span> (1984) and <span class="italic">A Wider Pedler Family History</span> (1989).<br>
<br>As his career and active retirement demonstrated, Pedler was &#145;intelligent, hard-working and tough&#146;  (H. Macmillan, <span class="italic">War Diaries: Politics and War in the Mediterranean, January 1943&#150;May 1945</span>, 1984, 422). He had also &#145;a capacity for making and keeping friends&#146; and, although &#145;tough in pursuit of his objectives&#146;, possessed a &#145;strong sense of social justice and a concern for the individual&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 April 1991). After a long and happy marriage, Pedler died at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, London, on 6 April 1991. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
