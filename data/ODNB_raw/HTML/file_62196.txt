<span class="headword">Fortescue <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Beech]</span>,  Winifred</span>, Lady Fortescue  (1888&#150;1951), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 7 February 1888 at the rectory, Great Bealings, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, the daughter of Howard Beech, rector of Great Bealings, and his wife, Henrietta Mildred Godden. She had two elder brothers, Mervyn and Guy, and a sister, Marjory, born in 1892. She was educated at home, mainly by her mother, until the age of nine, and then went with one of her brothers to a boys' school, St Augustine's, Cliftonville, an experience that made her independent and plain-speaking all her life. At sixteen she went to Old Cedar House School in Slough, which, soon after her arrival, transferred to London and became Wentworth Hall, Mill Hill. In 1905 she broke the mould and persuaded her parents, initially reluctant, to allow her to train as an actress at one of the first drama schools. For the daughter of a Victorian rectory to enter what was still a barely respectable profession took considerable strength of character on her part, and considerable tolerance on the part of her parents. She was a minor success playing the West End and, in the years up to 1914, touring Britain and Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1911 she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33213/', "John William Fortescue (1859&#150;1933)")</script>, thirty years her senior and the king's librarian and archivist at Windsor. He was also working on his history of the British army, which occupied the rest of his life. Despite the difference in their ages it was, she insisted, love at first sight. They were married in April 1914. During the First World War, Winifred Fortescue worked with wounded servicemen in Windsor and in London, while John worked on an &#145;interim&#146; official history of the war. However, at the end of the war it became clear to them both that John Fortescue would not be able to finance himself and finish his history of the British army. To Winifred, convinced as many were of the importance of his work, this was another challenge. In 1921 she set up her company, Cintra, in a flat in Knightsbridge dealing with imported clothes from southern Europe. Her business was successful, but in 1925, partly as a result of the strain of her work, she became ill and was forced to sell it. As soon as she recovered she began writing, publishing features in several London papers and in <span class="italic">Punch</span>; she was briefly women's editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>.<br>
<br>In 1926 John Fortescue was knighted, and in 1929 he finished his history of the British army. He earned a little from writing, as did Winifred, but it became clear to both of them that their finances and his health meant that they would need to find somewhere cheaper to live. They found the answer in Provence, which dominated the rest of her life. The Provence of 1930 was remote, poor, and even bleak, especially in winter. Its economy was based on cheap wine and olives, but housing was inexpensive. However, the devaluation of the pound and Sir John's continuing ill health brought them near to the edge of financial calamity. Yet they loved the land they had found. Unlike many visitors (and colonizers) Lady Fortescue spoke French well and was accepted by her neighbours.<br>
<br>When Sir John Fortescue died in 1933 Winifred's friends and family urged her to return to England, but she refused. Provence had become her home, and she now wrote about it. In 1935 she published <span class="italic">Perfume from Provence</span>, a witty account of her life in France with Sir John. It foreshadows many later popular accounts of the English in France and has contributed more than a little to their ideas. Through the friendship of an American exile, Elisabeth Starr, she grew to know Provence and its surrounding <i>d&eacute;partements</i> in a way few English of her period did. In <span class="italic">Sunset House</span>, published in 1937, she wrote of her trips with Starr through Provence, the Alps, and the fashionable coast. It is in many ways a lighter and happier book than her first and is full of an exuberance which reminds the reader she was once a young actress.<br>
<br>The idyll was short-lived. The collapse of France in 1940 found Winifred back in England, although Elisabeth Starr remained in Provence. However, Winifred's love of France did not fail. At a time when France and the French were deeply unpopular in Britain she became one of the first organizers of the Amis des Volontaires Fran&ccedil;ais, a group of English sympathizers and supporters of the Free French. Her accounts of those years, <span class="italic">Trampled Lilies</span> (1941) and <span class="italic">Beauty for Ashes</span> (1948), are important and moving records of the &#145;little history&#146; of those who stood by France in her darkest days.<br>
<br>As the war progressed, news from Provence and from Elisabeth Starr got worse. In the terrible winter of 1943&#150;4 Starr died from malnutrition, and on the day Paris was liberated Winifred Fortescue decided that as soon as the south was liberated she would return and continue the medical work begun by her &#145;beloved companion&#146; among the poor and especially the children of Provence. She began collecting clothes, food, and money, and in May 1945 she returned to France and found a desperate situation. What she had brought with her seemed, as she wrote, &#145;pitifully small and inadequate&#146;, but in the devastated land of Provence it seemed massive. She continued her fund-raising and her trips, and at Christmas 1945 she arranged that every child in her area should have something to hang on the <i>arbre de No&euml;l</i>. As a result she became known as Maman No&euml;l. Her final triumph was to see, in 1947, the tiny hospital built by Elisabeth Starr rebuilt and opened for the care of disabled orphans.<br>
<br>After the end of the war Winifred settled again in Provence. She wrote one more book, <span class="italic">Laughter in Provence</span>. In many ways it may be her best. It laughs at herself, her friends, and her neighbours, especially the new rich. On these she comments wryly, and usually generously, but the book is imbued with a sense of the end of an era.<br>
<br>Winifred Fortescue died on 9 April 1951 at Fort Escu (Sunset House), Opio, Alpes-Maritimes, France, and was buried in the cemetery at Opio where her friend Elisabeth already lay. On her tombstone is carved the cross of Lorraine, a mark of honour for those who fought for &#145;la France libre&#146;, and the name Maman No&euml;l. The tombstone and the simple but powerful tributes are fitting for an Englishwoman who not only took inspiration and love from Provence but also paid for them in equal measure.<br>
