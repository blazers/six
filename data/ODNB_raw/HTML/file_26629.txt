<span class="headword">Stradling, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1498&#150;1571), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edward Stradling (<i>d</i>. 1535) of St Donats, Glamorgan, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1513), daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell of Lanherne in Cornwall. Elizabeth's kinsman Sir Thomas Arundell (<i>d</i>. 1552) was attached to Cardinal Wolsey and related to the earl of Arundel. His parents' connections explain Thomas Stradling's marriage in 1516 to Katherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Gamage of Coety, Glamorgan, and his appointment as a sewer of the chamber in Henry VIII's household; after his father's death his attachment to Glamorgan and the family seat of St Donats was strong. He had already secured for life the revenues and offices of the lordships of Meisgyn, Glynrhondda, and Senghennydd in September 1525, and after 1535 his responsibilities multiplied, notably on commissions in Glamorgan (from 1536), and in Somerset (1538&#150;44) and Dorset (1538&#150;40), where he also held land. In October 1542 he purchased Neath Abbey's manor of Nash. Relations with the main landowners in Glamorgan, especially the Herberts, were not easy, and tensions often led to violence. It was reported of the Stradlings in the early 1530s that &#145;there are twelve brothers, most of them bastards, and they have no living but by extortion and pilling of the King's subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 5, no. 298).<br>
<br>The Arundel connection accounts for Stradling's part in political crises under Edward VI. Knighted in 1547 and sheriff of Glamorgan in 1547&#150;8, he had interests that spread to Sussex, where the earl of Arundel's influence was great. In 1550 Stradling acquired the Sussex manor of Binderton, formerly held by Tarrant Priory in Dorset. Family marriage alliances in Sussex cemented the relationship. However, at the time of the duke of Somerset's second downfall in October 1551, Stradling was arrested with Arundel and remained a prisoner in the Tower of London for over a year. He had been released by May 1553.<br>
<br>During Mary's reign Stradling received further favours. The Arundel connection explains his election to the parliament of October 1553 for the duchy of Lancaster borough of East Grinstead, Sussex, where Arundel was steward, and for Arundel borough in April 1554. He served on the commission of the peace in 1554 in the counties of Gloucester, Hereford, Shropshire, and Worcester, and in November was described as a servant of Queen Mary and her consort, Philip of Spain. His attachment to the court and his conservative religious sympathies led to his appointment in February 1557 as muster-master of the queen's army, and to investigate heresies and the distribution of seditious books. In July 1558 he was granted the reversion of the Herbert manor of Sully, Glamorgan, and lands in Bedfordshire. He was emboldened to take action against the earl of Pembroke in Star Chamber in 1557 for harsh measures in raising men in Glamorgan for the French war.<br>
<br>Stradling could expect little from Elizabeth I; three of his children&#151;his younger son David, and two daughters&#151;appear to have retired abroad presumably because they shared his Catholic religious views. But several of his brothers secured a general pardon in January 1559. Two months later, on 20 March, the government's suspicion was reflected in its reaction to the &#145;miracle of St Donats&#146;. The figure of a cross which appeared to Stradling in the stump of an ash tree left standing after a storm was later recorded in four paintings commissioned by him; the story was reported to the pope and appeared in English and Welsh writings subsequently published abroad. Pilgrims visited St Donats, and in spring 1561 Stradling was among the circle of Sir Edward Waldegrave, his neighbour in Somerset, who were sent to the Tower of London. The tree was cut down and transported to the council in London. Stradling was released in October 1563; but following the northern uprising of 1569 he refused to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, and a commission was appointed in December to investigate his conduct. It found him bedridden, properly attending church when he could, and even supplying wine for the sacrament in local churches. When he died at St Donats Castle on 27 January 1571, his will made bequests to over twenty Glamorgan churches. He added the north porch and lady chapel to St Donats church, where he was buried close to his parents. He was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26624/', "Sir Edward Stradling (d. 1609)")</script>.<br>
