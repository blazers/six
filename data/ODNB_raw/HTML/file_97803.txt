<span class="headword">Pounds,  Norman John Greville</span>  (1912&#150;2006), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 23 February 1912 at 13 Kensington Gardens, Walcot, Bath, one of three sons of John Greville Pounds (1883&#150;1935), a type compositor, and his wife, Camilla Martha Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher (1884&#150;1963), a schoolteacher. From explorations of Bath and its environs on foot and by bicycle, from a growing awareness of the impact of the First World War even on Bath, and from reading his father's books on famous battles through the centuries, Pounds developed his lifetime enthusiasm for geography and history. Sensitive to the fundamental importance of education during early childhood, Pounds's parents sent him successively between the ages of five and eleven to three schools. The first two were Church of England schools: they underpinned his lifelong hostility to organized religion but not to its history. From 1923 to 1931 he was a scholarship boy at King Edward's, the local independent grammar school where he became head prefect and captain of rugby. Aside from development of his critical faculties, Pounds acquired from his parents an abiding passion for classical music and from King Edward's his enduring commitment to rugby as player, coach, referee, and spectator.<br>
<br>In 1931 Pounds went to Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge, then a non-collegiate institution of the university. After obtaining an upper second in part 1 of the historical tripos in 1933 he transferred to read part 1 of the geographical tripos, being placed in the first class in 1934. He had been able to attend lectures by distinguished historians (including the medievalists Helen Cam and G. G. Coulton) and geographers (including the historical geographers Bernard Manning and H. Clifford Darby). After graduating BA in 1934 he returned to Cambridge for a further year to acquire a diploma in education.<br>
<br>Pounds taught geography and history at Falmouth grammar school in Cornwall from 1935 until 1944. He married Dorothy Josephine Mitchell (1910&#150;1989), daughter of Joseph Mitchell, cabinet-maker, on 30 July 1938: she was then said to be living in Bath and he in Falmouth. Unfit for war service because of poor eyesight, Pounds served as a fire-watcher but also used his time, registered as an external student of the University of London, to obtain in 1942 a first-class BA degree in geography and history and to write a dissertation on the historical geography of Cornwall, for which he was awarded the degree of PhD in 1945. Pounds returned to Cambridge in 1944, as director of studies in geography and tutor at Fitzwilliam House. Although not holding a university appointment, he lectured for the geographical tripos on economic and political geography, but not every year, and he was never a tripos examiner.<br>
<br>Disappointed at not being integrated fully into the university's department of geography, and despairing of constantly mediating between two disputatious colleagues at Fitzwilliam House, Pounds sought new pastures. For the Michaelmas term of 1949 he went as visiting professor to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, attracted there because its staff included Richard Hartshorne, whom Pounds revered as a political and historical geographer. While there he also visited, by invitation, Indiana University. He returned to Cambridge for two university terms before leaving to take up an offered appointment as professor of geography at Indiana. He held that post until 1968, when it was transformed into a professorship of geography and history, reflecting his teaching and research interests and his work with Indiana University's Institute of East European Studies.<br>
<br>Pounds was involved in university administration, as tutor at Fitzwilliam House (1944&#150;50), as chairman of Indiana's Institute of East European Studies (1952), and as head of Indiana's department of geography (1962&#150;5), but he derived little satisfaction from it. Instead he devoted his vitality and creative intellect to teaching and writing. He only stopped teaching when he was ninety-two (in 2004, after lecturing to audiences of more than 100 members of the University of the Third Age in Cambridge) and he was still writing at the time of his death (an unfinished book on postage stamps and politics). His beautifully structured lectures were full of information and anecdotes, made surprising connections, and paraded his profound enthusiasm for his subject. At Indiana University in 1961 he was voted &#145;the most popular professor&#146; on campus; the class of 1969 presented him with the distinguished teaching award &#145;for his excellence in teaching as exemplified by mastery of his academic field, effective classroom presentation, and sensitivity to the needs of his students&#146;; and in 1980 a survey of Indiana's graduates about the teaching of more than 1200 professors placed Pounds in the top 16. He was an outstanding and captivating lecturer.<br>
<br>Pounds's desire to communicate with large audiences also found expression in his writing of books&#151;many, but not all of them, student textbooks&#151;on economic geography, political geography, the historical geography of Europe, the history of material culture, medieval castles, and medieval cities. In addition he wrote books on the historical, economic, and political geographies of particular countries and regions, including Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the Ruhr, eastern Europe, North America, the Mediterranean, and Upper Silesia. For these he travelled widely and read publications in many European languages. He wrote and published his first book while teaching at Falmouth, in his thirties, but probably the most enduring of his writings were his two significantly original books published in retirement, in his late eighties and early nineties, on the history of church and parish in England as a whole and in Cambridgeshire in particular.<br>
<br>Pounds had no children. He was a workaholic, addicted to lecturing and publishing. He retained affection for Cornwall and Cambridge. Royalties from his books enabled him during periods of his life to have homes in both places as well as in Bloomington, Indiana. Retired from Indiana University in 1977, he moved back to the United Kingdom, ultimately settling down in Cambridge. An active retirement led to his being elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1980), president of the Royal Archaeological Institute (1987&#150;90), and president of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society (1992&#150;4). He was elected to an honorary fellowship of Fitzwilliam College in 1990. He was generous in giving time to his students and friends, and money to his favoured institutions: he funded musical activity and a bronze statue, <span class="italic">The First Undergraduate, 1869</span>, at Fitzwilliam College (the college had been founded as Fitzwilliam Hall in 1869), and he established a development and welfare fund to support the staff of Cambridge University Library in recognition of the unstinting help they gave him during his declining years when increasingly confined by arthritis to a wheelchair. He died at his home, 189 Huntingdon Road, Cambridge, on 24 March 2006 of leukaemia, bronchopneumonia, and heart failure. His funeral service, held on 6 April at Fitzwilliam College chapel, was followed by burial at the woodland burial ground at Barton, near Cambridge. A memorial service was held at Fitzwilliam College on 4 November 2006.<br>
