<span class="headword">Stark,  James</span>  (1794&#150;1859), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 19 November 1794 in the parish of St Michael Coslany, Norwich, the youngest of four children of Michael Stark (1749&#150;1831), a dyer from Fife, Scotland, and his wife, Jane (1757&#150;1843), daughter of John Ivory, a Norwich stonemason. Stark attended Norwich grammar school, and during this time he became a frequent visitor to the painting room of Norwich school artist John Crome (1768&#150;1821) through his friendship with his son John Berney Crome (1794&#150;1842). In 1811 he was articled to John Crome for three years. George Vincent (1796&#150;1832) was also a pupil of Crome at this time. At the end of his apprenticeship in 1814 Stark moved to London to study figure drawing. He remained in contact with Crome, who in his famous letter dated 1816 (1817?) advised his former pupil &#145;Brea[d]th must be attended to, if you paint but a muscle give it brea[d]th&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 43830, fol. 73). In 1817 he entered the Royal Academy Schools. He was at the time living at 85 Newman Street with another Norwich artist, Joseph Clover (1779&#150;1853), who painted his portrait, to which Stark added the landscape background (1818; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery). In 1818 he was awarded a premium by the British Institution for his painting <span class="italic">Lambeth, Looking towards Westminster Bridge</span> (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), bought by the Countess De Grey.<br>
<br>Even at this early stage in his career Stark had an impressive list of patrons, but by 1821 a painful illness forced him to return to his family in Norwich. Poor health, probably caused by kidney stones, was to affect him for the rest of his life and initially prevented him from painting for three years. In 1821 he began experimenting with etching. Only six etchings are known (British Museum, London), two of which are dated April 1821. On 17 July 1821 he married Elizabeth Dinmore (1792&#150;1834) of King's Lynn. They had three surviving children. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36256/', "Arthur James Stark (1831&#150;1902)")</script>, became a landscape and animal painter. From 1809 Stark had been a regular exhibitor with the Norwich Society of Artists, and continued exhibiting with it until 1832. He became its vice-president in 1828 and 1829 and president in 1830, and in 1827 he read an essay to its members &#145;on the moral and political influence of the Fine Arts&#146; urging public support for the arts  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 26 May 1827). Also in 1827 he began issuing thirty-six engravings in four parts of <span class="italic">Scenery of the rivers of Norfolk, comprising the Yare, the Waveney, and the Bure. From pictures painted by James Stark, with historical and geological descriptions by J. W. Robberds, jun. esq.</span> (published in a single volume in 1834). The plates were engraved by sixteen different engravers. In 1830 Stark and his family returned to London and took a house at 14 Beaufort Row, Chelsea, but in 1834 Stark's wife died of consumption. He moved to 10 York Place, Windsor, in 1840 and for the next ten years found subjects for his paintings in the wooded landscape of the royal park. In 1849 he moved back to London to lodgings at 35 Norfolk Street, Strand, to allow his son to pursue his training in art, but Stark &#145;had by this time become too ill to paint, and the two were leading a hand-to-mouth existence on the proceeds of [Arthur Stark's] exhibits&#146;  (J. A. Stark, New Dudley Gallery exhibition catalogue, London, 1907).<br>
<br>Despite his delicate health, Stark's exhibits indicate wide travel throughout Britain. His earlier paintings of glades or grove scenes typify the Norwich school landscape and show the predominant influence of Crome and the Dutch school, particularly Hobbema. Following his move to London in 1830, his touch became lighter with fresher colours and more open compositions, as in <span class="italic">Cromer</span> (<i>c</i>.1835; Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery), while his Windsor paintings have more dashing brushstrokes. He did not usually sign his work. His watercolours, which are freely drawn with a use of clear, green colour, were frequently unfinished. His work is well represented in the collection of Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery. Stark exhibited widely in Norwich and in London with the Royal Academy (1811&#150;59), the British Institution (1814&#150;59), the Royal Watercolour Society (1817&#150;19), and the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists (1824&#150;48), as well as in other major cities in Britain. His pupils were Samuel David Colkett (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1863), Alfred Priest (1810&#150;1850), Henry Jutsum (1816&#150;1869), and his son Arthur James Stark, who on occasion painted the animals in his father's landscapes. Stark had a wide circle of artist friends including William Collins (1788&#150;1847), Edward William Cooke (1811&#150;1880), with whom he went on several sketching trips, and John Sell Cotman (1782&#150;1842). James Stark died on 24 March 1859 at his home, 9 Mornington Place, Hampstead Road, London, of disease of the kidneys and bladder, and was taken back to Norwich to be buried in the Rosary cemetery on 28 March. He died intestate with an estate of less than &pound;200.<br>
