</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Penn, Sir  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1621, <em>d.</em> 1670), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized in St Thomas's Church, Bristol, on 23 April 1621, the son of Giles Penn, a seaman and merchant of the city, and his wife, Joan Gilbert of Somerset. The Penns had long been landowners in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire, but William, younger son of a younger son, with no expectation of inheritance, necessarily made his career in the sea and its commerce. About 1638 he began to serve under William Batten, his future colleague. Penn became a muster-master or clerk of the cheque. He is said to have attained his first command at the age of twenty-one, though no specific record survives. On 6 January 1644 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1682), daughter of Hans Jasper of Rotterdam and widow of Nicasius van der Schuren, a Dutchman living at Kilconry, co. Clare. Margaret had acquired an estate in Ireland from her first husband, to which Penn became entitled as her second, but it was far from lucrative, and the early years of their marriage were spent in a modest house on Tower Hill. Since the only account of these days is the later recollection of a spiteful neighbour, enthusiastically repeated by Pepys, it may be doubted if Penn was truly &#145;pitiful&#146; or his wife &#145;a dirty slattern&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.226&#150;7). By the same dubious report Penn was at first disposed to drink the king's health, but later converted to the parliamentary cause.<h2>
<a name="Earlynavalcampaigns"></a>Early naval campaigns</h2>Penn was certainly regarded as a reliable parliamentarian by 22 May 1644 when he was appointed to captain parliament's ship the <i>Fellowship</i>; on 31 December he was additionally commissioned rear-admiral of the Irish squadron. On 17 June he was designated to take the same ship into Scottish waters, but by early July he was transferred to the larger <i>Happy Entrance</i> with temporary rank of vice-admiral. He was instructed to assist at the siege of Youghal, where he arrived on 8 July. Although the siege was still proceeding when he left on 7 August, he had acquitted himself well and there was discontent among his crew when he was obliged to cede command to Crowther.<br>
<br>On 23 September Penn was returned to the <i>Fellowship</i>. On 21 February 1646 he was ordered to take charge of an operation in support of Bunratty Castle; this stronghold overlooking the Shannon estuary had been made available to parliament as a base from which to check royalist privateering out of Limerick. Penn arrived there on 20 March, and on 18 April was constituted rear-admiral. It proved impossible to sustain the castle by sea when the enemy were in occupation of the surrounding country, and no blame attached to Penn for the surrender of the garrison on 13 July. Indeed, on 4 August he was promoted to command the newly built <i>Assurance</i>, with orders to patrol between Land's End and southern Ireland. He was not enthusiastic for further minor operations on the Irish coast, and his election as freeman of Portsmouth indicates his wish to join the main fleet. But he was on the Irish station throughout 1647. In March 1648 he was ordered to act against the royalist rising in west Wales. Fears that he might have joined what he was sent to suppress prompted his summons to London on 14 April. Three days later the case against him was respited for want of information; on 2 May new operational orders were sent to him, and on 4 May he was informed that his loyalty was no longer in question. Early in 1649 he met Rupert off Castlehaven, but recognizing that he was outgunned, he withdrew without engaging. On 18 April he was reappointed vice-admiral of Ireland, with captaincy of the <i>Lion</i> (as which he was paid from 1 May that year to 25 June 1650). During this time he blockaded Waterford, Limerick, and Galway, and was commended for his &#145;more than ordinary care&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1650</i>, 209).<br>
<br>On 26 August 1650 Penn was made captain of the <i>Fairfax</i>, at this point still attached to the Irish squadron. On 24 October he was instructed to bring her into Portsmouth to refit. Next day the admiralty committee decided to send him to Lisbon to relieve Blake and pursue Rupert. His instructions were approved by the council on 2 November, and he received them on the 25th. On 30 November he sailed from Spithead in the <i>Centurion</i>, as the <i>Fairfax</i> was not ready. On 21 January he was joined by Lawson in the <i>Fairfax</i>, to which he transferred; he now had his intended squadron of eight. His instructions were to go first to the Azores and take any homebound Portuguese treasure ships he found, then to follow Rupert and attack him and the French as occasion served. He needed to avoid confrontation with the combined French and royalist forces, but would have superiority over the latter alone. Having found nothing in the Azores, he entered the Mediterranean on 29 March. He proceeded as far as Malta, where on 29 July he had reports of Rupert off Cadiz. He headed back at once, reaching Gibraltar on 9 September. On the 25th Rupert was reported in the Azores. Penn remained at the mouth of the straits, intending to intercept Rupert's return, never supposing that he would head in the opposite direction. Penn had neither instructions nor means to pursue the royalists to the Caribbean, and he returned to England by 18 March 1652. He had taken thirty-six French prizes and had significantly extended the range of English squadronal patrol in the Mediterranean, but he had never been close to Rupert or Maurice.<h2>
<a name="Dutchwars"></a>Dutch wars</h2>On 2 April 1652 in the Downs Penn was reunited with Blake, who on 5 May appointed him captain of the <i>Triumph</i>. On 19 May he was further advanced to be Blake's vice-admiral. He told Cromwell that many officers doubted the moral justification of the Dutch war now beginning, but Penn himself was assured it was God's will. At the first major engagement, Kentish Knock on 28 September, Blake and Penn ran aground while attacking the Dutch van. As the Dutch closed on them Penn was able to get free, and to turn on those who had seen him as easy prey: &#145;it fell out better &hellip; than we could have cast it ourselves&#146;  (Penn, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 1.447). His success here was blighted by the accusation that he had hidden in a coil of rope; this canard, apparently first circulated by Nehemiah Bourne, was given new life after Lowestoft in 1665, and would be enshrined in the satirical poem <span class="italic">Second Advice to a Painter</span> (lines 87&#150;8). Penn was absent from the defeat at Dungeness (30 November) while engaged in convoying the Newcastle coal fleet. In January 1653 he was appointed captain of the <i>Speaker</i>, vice-admiral of the fleet, and admiral of the White squadron. He had to yield place to Monck, and it was as admiral of the blue that he fought at Portland on 18 February. His tacking through the Dutch line (commanded by the Dutch Admiral Evertsen) on this occasion brought praise for his courage and (perhaps inadvertently) innovative tactics.<br>
<br>In April 1653 Penn expressed his loyalty to the new regime established by Cromwell on his expulsion of the Rump. In this month he again convoyed the colliers. As captain of the <i>James</i> and admiral of the white he gained further honour in the battles of 2&#150;3 June and 29&#150;31 July. On 3 June Monck recommended to the admiralty commissioners that for his &#145;honesty and ability&#146; Penn be appointed general-at-sea  (Penn, <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 1.492). On 6 August he was decorated with a gold chain worth &pound;100, to which &pound;30 would be added in January 1655. On 2 December he was formally nominated general and a commissioner of the admiralty, appointments confirmed the following day. Towards the end of the war he was anxious for peace, perhaps not least for time to settle his private affairs. On 1 September 1654 he petitioned the protector and council for recompense of &pound;8636 19<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. said to have been lost to his wife's estate by the &#145;late horrid rebellion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 351). He was immediately granted lands forfeited by the earl of Clancarty, with an annual value of &pound;300.<h2>
<a name="Caribbeanexpedition"></a>Caribbean expedition</h2>Penn had already on 18 August been chosen to lead the protector's cherished expedition to the Caribbean, the &#145;western design&#146; in which Cromwell hoped to find continuing use for his victorious navy by annihilating the Spanish empire in the West Indies. Penn would share command with Robert Venables (general of the land forces) and a body of civilian commissioners intended to supervise colonization once victory had been achieved. Instructions drawn up on 9 December spoke of &#145;getting ground&#146; without naming any target  (Firth, 109). The prime objective, it soon transpired, was Hispaniola, which had been the first European settlement in the Americas. The fleet sailed from Spithead on 25 December, Penn commanding from the <i>Swiftsure</i>, with thirty-seven other warships, support vessels, and 2500 to 3000 soldiers. On 29 January they came to Barbados where another 5500 men were engaged and 1200 of the seamen formed into a regiment to serve ashore. Penn seized a number of Dutch ships trading in contravention of parliament's orders and then sailed on 31 March, calling at Antigua and other islands already in English hands. On 13 April they came in sight of St Domingo on Hispaniola. Penn declined to risk a frontal assault, and the troops were landed next day some 25 miles west at Nizao. When they reached the capital they were easily repulsed. Penn offered his artillery in support of a further attempt, and was furious when this was rejected by Venables. There is no doubt that antagonism between Penn and Venables (which Cromwell had foreseen and attempted to defuse) contributed to lack of co-ordination at all levels. Penn was blamed by the military for the change of landing site, for denying them supplies, and for the unavailability of guides. For all these issues Penn advanced cogent operational reasons, and the failure of the assault was, as even Venables acknowledged, chiefly the fault of a &#145;rascally rabble of raw and unexercised men&#146; and their inadequate provisions  (Firth, 100).<br>
<br>The task force was, however, not crippled, and by 3 May when the troops re-embarked the &#145;general voice was for Jamaica&#146;  (Battick, 14). Penn confirmed this objective to his officers on the following day, and the island was sighted on the 9th. Penn personally led the landing on 10 May aboard the <i>Martin</i> galley, to which he transferred because of its shallow draught. At first the Spanish resisted, but their forts were abandoned before all the troops were ashore and the garrison surrendered next day. By 17 May the whole island was in English hands.<br>
<br>Penn subsequently sent two of his ships to reconnoitre the Spanish main, but made no further attempt to seize territory or shipping. After a month on Jamaica, increasingly ill, Penn decided to return home to report; he sailed on 25 June and made Spithead on 31 August. On 3 September the fleet was ordered into the Thames, and on the 12th Penn was interviewed in Whitehall. On the 20th he and Venables were sent to the Tower. Their arrest was gleefully reported by the royalists, who expected the commanders to be executed for failing to accomplish the &#145;design&#146;. Clarendon would allege that both men were all along &#145;well affected to the King's service&#146; and &#145;not fond of the enterprise they were to conduct&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 6.5). As it happened the result had been as the royalists wished: Anglo-Spanish hostilities in Europe, which Cromwell had hoped to avoid, were provoked, while the protector was denied the great victory which would have buttressed his regime. But it is inconceivable that Penn and Venables, even had they been so minded, could have engineered just this outcome. Their imprisonment is adequately explained by their return without orders and Cromwell's pique at the frustration of his plans. On 25 October Penn apologized to the protector for his disobedience and begged to be freed for the sake of his family and his &#145;increasing distemper&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1655</i>, 396). His release was ordered the same day on his relinquishing his commission. He was not to serve the protectorate again, and he declined to assist a long-running inquiry into unused slops. He retired to Ireland, and from his seat at Macroom, co. Cork, attended to his estates. He was not absolutely in disgrace, for in 1658 he received a knighthood from Henry Cromwell, and his wife was able to catch a lift to England aboard one of the state's ships.<h2>
<a name="Serviceashore"></a>Service ashore</h2>In 1659 Penn went to England, seeking to serve the republic but having already made contacts with royalists. While lodging in the Strand he received a friendly letter (dated 30 June) from Monck, offering to sponsor his return to naval service. In consequence Penn was restored to the admiralty commission on 24 March 1660. Monck was also responsible for securing Penn's election to the Convention Parliament as member for Weymouth. On 12 May Monck instructed him to prepare ships at Portsmouth and in the Thames to bring the king home, for which he would receive a special payment of &pound;100. He sailed with the Restoration fleet, and on 9 June received an authentic knighthood. On 4 July he was nominated to the new Navy Board as an extra commissioner; his patent passed the seal on 17 August. He was a key adviser to the duke of York as lord high admiral, and it is likely that he helped draft the instructions issued in the duke's name, for which he collected a volume of precedents  (BL, Sloane MS 3232).<br>
<br>At the Restoration Penn was also made governor of Kinsale, vice-admiral of Munster, and a member of the province's council. He commanded a company of foot in the Irish army and was <i>ex officio</i> JP for the counties in which the naval dockyards stood. He was re-elected for Weymouth in the Cavalier Parliament of 1661, retaining his seat until he died. He became an elder brother of Trinity House, of which he became master in 1667&#150;8. Following the return of Lord Clancarty's lands under the Restoration settlement, Penn was on 28 October 1661 compensated with 12,000 other Irish acres, with an annual value of &pound;423, but it would take until 1669 to secure his title against other interests.<br>
<br>Penn came into residence at the Navy Office in Seething Lane on 27 July 1660, thus becoming a neighbour of his junior colleague Pepys, in whose diary the last phases of Penn's career are sharply described. Pepys, although welcoming Penn as &#145;very sociable &hellip; and an able man&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.241) soon fell out with him over contracts and appointments, and above all because he saw him as enemy to his own patron Sandwich. Penn was ever thereafter &#145;as false a fellow as ever was born&#146;  (ibid., 7.68) and Pepys took every opportunity to denigrate Penn's social address, service career, and administrative probity and competence. Yet he conceded he was the &#145;only fit man&#146; to succeed the ineffectual Mennes as comptroller  (ibid., 7.328). Mennes himself nominated Penn as his deputy when he went to sea in November 1661, but subsequently resisted all attempts to pass his duties to Penn in part or whole.<br>
<br>At the outset of the Second Anglo-Dutch War Penn served afloat again, initially (from 10 November 1664) aboard the <i>Royal James</i>, and after 18 November as chief of staff to the duke of York in the <i>Royal Charles</i>, with the unique rank of &#145;captain great commander&#146;. In this capacity he served at the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665, behaving &#145;so well that those who were most unsatisfied with him before are full of his commendations&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1664&#150;5</i>, 408). Penn retired exhausted after the day's action, unaware (he would claim) that a member of the duke's household took upon himself to give order to slacken sail, thinking to save his master from risk of another day's battle. There was some suggestion that Penn was involved in a cover-up: Burnet saw in it the origin of James's indulgence towards dissenters  (Burnet, 78), but, malice apart, he may have confused Penn with the ship's captain, Harman. Penn's conduct on this occasion would not be significantly in question when he faced impeachment for the other great scandal of the year. On 2 July he had been made vice-admiral to Sandwich and admiral of the white. As such he was party to the breaking bulk of prizes taken at Bergen in September, and it emerged that he was the chief agent of this breach of maritime law (in some contrast to his strictures on the subject during his West Indies voyage).<br>
<br>Although briefly in command of the fleet in Sandwich's absence in November and December 1665, Penn's employment at sea for the rest of the war was prevented by Monck, who had accused him of recommending &#145;all these roguish fanatic captains&#146; to the duke  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.291). Penn was, however, &#145;overwhelmed with a multiplicity of business&#146; ashore in 1666  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1665&#150;6</i>, 445). It was as an armchair strategist that he offered his opinions on the conduct of the Four Days' Battle (1&#150;4 June), stressing the importance of keeping line-ahead, and not allowing ships to withdraw for minor repairs.<br>
<br>On 16 January Penn was finally given an official responsibility for pursers' and victuallers' accounts, by way of devolving the duties of the comptroller. In July, as master of Trinity House, he had responsibility for the Thames defences in the face of the Dutch attack. Not uncharacteristically he failed to give the king a straight answer when asked about the advisability of clearing the river of blockships. On 21 October he faced the parliamentary inquiry into miscarriages of the war on the question of the failure to pursue the Dutch after Lowestoft; this issue was easily deflected. On 3 December he faced the more difficult accusation about the prize-goods affair. In March 1668 it was proposed that he should have a sea command; Penn was reluctant, but the king and duke insisted. MPs, however, were incensed that a new command should be given to one whom they had yet to examine fully about his last, and the prize-goods issue was subjected to intense scrutiny. Penn was called before the Commons on 14 April; a committee chaired by Sir Robert Howard reported on 21 April and articles of impeachment were read. The house decided to suspend Penn but not eject him. The matter then passed to the Lords, where Penn appeared on 27 April, calling himself a &#145;very unhappy man&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 12.235). He appeared again on the 29th, but there were no further proceedings. Penn had powerful friends, and the main purpose of the exercise&#151;prevention of his command&#151;had been achieved. This did not stop him from claiming the full allowance for six months' imaginary service.<br>
<br>Despite some enthusiasm for his new responsibilities at the Navy Board, Penn decided to resign his commissionership in 1668 on being offered a share in the new naval victualling contract; this was issued on 24 February 1669, and his patent was cancelled on 17 June. By 31 July he had also resigned the governorship of Kinsale to his kinsman Rooth. Penn's health had long been failing, and he died at Walthamstow, where he lived next to Batten, on 16 September 1670, On the 30th he was buried in the church of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, where his memorial stands. His wife survived him until 1682. In addition to his celebrated elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21857/', "William Penn (1644&#150;1718)")</script>, he had a son Richard and a daughter Margaret (who married Anthony Lowther in February 1667).<br>
<br>Penn was much distressed by his elder son's nonconformity, which led to his expulsion from Oxford and eventual imprisonment. Despite their arguments, mutual affection persisted. The younger William, though abhorring the profession of arms, defended his father's reputation in it and presented the king with a collection of Sir William's naval papers (Magdalene College, Cambridge, Pepys Library, no. 2611). When asked to return another document to the navy, he said he valued &#145;the smallest relic that may be deemed a badge of my father's trade&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 562) and he named the colony he established in his father's honour.<br>
<br>Penn is said to have affected the puritan fashion to advance his career, but others have accepted his sincerity. He genuinely attempted to understand his son's beliefs, and was himself rumoured to have become a Quaker. At other times he was said to be an atheist, or hoping to &#145;live and die&#146; an Anabaptist  (<span class="italic">Samuel Pepys and the Second Dutch War</span>, 20). Yet he conformed to the religion and, it seems, the general morals of the Restoration. He has been judged too indecisive for supreme command, and his most important assignment was deemed a failure at the time. It has, however, since been recognized as a decisive moment in British imperial history, with continuing consequences for the present state of Jamaica.<br>
