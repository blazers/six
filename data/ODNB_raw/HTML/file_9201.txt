<span class="headword">Neville <span class="st"> [Fauconberg]</span>,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Bastard of Fauconberg]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1471), <span class="occ">naval commander and rebel</span>, was one of at least two illegitimate sons of the Yorkist commander <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19967/', "William Neville, Lord Fauconberg (d. 1463)")</script> in right of his mad wife and, from 1461, earl of Kent. Lord Fauconberg was next brother to Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, uncle to Salisbury's son Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, and was one of their closest allies on the northern borders, at Calais, and at sea. On his death in 1463 his bastards may have transferred to Warwick's service and served him at sea, for Warwick, like Salisbury and Kent before him, was keeper of the seas, had his own ships, and was besides captain of Calais and warden of the Cinque Ports. Such possibilities are speculation, for Thomas Neville's life is almost wholly undocumented: the identity of his mother, his date of birth, whether he married, and his residence are all unknown.<br>
<br>Neville was already adult on 4 March 1470, when he was paid &pound;50 for maritime service against the Hanse, but he deserted, joining the fleeing Warwick off Calais in late April, and preyed on Burgundian ships, some of which were restored at Louis XI's insistence. In October 1470 he invaded England and entered London with Warwick and then deputized for him as admiral with the grandiose title of &#145;captain of the navy of England and men of war both by sea and land&#146;. He engaged in piracy against the Portuguese, perhaps as far west as Brittany, and failed to thwart Edward IV's invasion from Burgundy. In late April 1471, following Warwick's defeat at Barnet, he landed in Kent, raising an army from the Calais veterans and the leaders and commons of the chief Kentish towns, and asked leave to pass through London. The city refused permission and informed him of Edward IV's victory at Tewkesbury, which did not deter him. His objective is obscure, but may have been to liberate Henry VI with a view to further resistance. With several thousand men, a core of hardened veterans, a train of ordnance, and a fleet that enabled him to cross the Thames at will, he launched a series of attacks on London from the south and east from 10 to 14 May, destroying the gate on London Bridge and briefly taking Aldgate, but was repulsed with heavy loss of life by Londoners stiffened with the noblemen whom Edward had left behind. His ships withdrew on 14 May, Neville himself and the Calais contingent on 18 May, and the rest of his men were abandoned. As he was still potentially troublesome, Neville negotiated a pardon (10 June) in return for surrendering forty-seven ships at Sandwich to the duke of Gloucester as lord admiral on 27 May. On 16 June he had a protection to accompany Gloucester northwards, where the duke had succeeded to Warwick's lands and offices and needed to win over his retainers. By 11 September he had been arrested at Southampton. He was dispatched to Gloucester in the north and executed; his head was placed on London Bridge facing Kent, and his brother, who was wounded, took sanctuary at Beverley. It is uncertain why Neville died, allegedly for a new offence, perhaps for collaboration with die-hard opponents of Edward IV. The details are not recorded, for he was not tried by common law, but presumably by the law of arms by Gloucester in his capacity as constable of England.<br>
