<span class="headword">Stubbs,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1618&#150;1675), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was probably born in Durham, though details of his parentage are unknown. He married Elizabeth Stubbs, and both became Quakers at the same time. According to George Fox's description, Stubbs was &#145;a poore man haveing a wife &amp; four Chrildren [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 2.49). Only two of these children can be identified: they are named in the Swarthmore manuscripts as Sarah and Lydia. Stubbs worked in a variety of jobs: if all the contemporary records are to be believed he was a soldier, a schoolmaster, and a husbandman.<br>
<br>Stubbs was a Baptist serving in the army at the time when the Quaker leader, George Fox, secured his conversion in 1653. Fox, who was then imprisoned at Carlisle, remembers Stubbs's conversion in his <span class="italic">Journal</span>, and the two were clearly good friends. Stubbs's travels and sufferings after he became a Friend were extensive, even by early Quaker terms. He joined a movement whose charismatic ministers felt the &#145;call&#146; to publish their ideas both in England and abroad; Stubbs, however, went further than most.<br>
<br>Stubbs's ministry began on home soil before encompassing Europe and the New World. From his northern base Stubbs moved southwards; he was travelling with William Caton in Kent when the couple were charged with vagrancy, placed in the stocks, and whipped. From being one of the first Quakers in Kent in 1655, Stubbs went on to contribute to the expansion of Quakerism in London, Colchester (1655), Scotland (1655), and Ireland (1656 and 1669): he was attacked in Coldbeck and imprisoned at Cork, but elsewhere appears to have escaped any serious injury. George Fox's recollection of Stubbs's journeys in &#145;Holland, Ireland, Scotland, Legarne, Rome, Aegypt, America&#146; shows that these foreign travels left a strong impression on the minds of others  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 1.141).<br>
<br>Stubbs made a brief journey to the continent with William Caton in 1655 (he had returned by August 1656). This international ministry was at first focused on establishing a Quaker community in the Netherlands, and Stubbs's residence in 1657 continued this work. In 1658, with Samuel Fisher, Stubbs's continental evangelism reached Italy, where pamphlets were distributed. Stubbs then became part of one of the Quakers' most ambitious ministries: beginning in the Netherlands he and two other Friends tried to travel to China via Alexandria. However, they were banished from Egypt and so Stubbs travelled on through Europe. During the 1660s Stubbs's ministry was mostly based in England&#151;he was in Lancaster prison until November 1664, which led to his petitioning Charles II for clemency. His final overseas ministry occurred in 1671, when a group including George Fox travelled throughout the North American colonies.<br>
<br>Stubbs died in London of consumption on 31 July 1675, and was buried at Chequer Alley, London. Fox commemorated the &#145;wise&#146; Stubbs's &#145;many sufferings&#146;, remarking that he was &#145;a notable Minister of the Gospel of Christ&#146;  (Lodge, 52).<br>
