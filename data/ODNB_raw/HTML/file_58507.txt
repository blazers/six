<span class="headword">Coper,  Hans Joachim</span>  (1920&#150;1981), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was born on 8 April 1920 in Chemnitz, Saxony, the second son of Julius Coper, a prosperous Jewish businessman, and his wife, Erna (<i>d</i>. 1969). Coper's childhood was deeply affected by the increasing harassment of Jewish citizens throughout the 1930s, something that led to the family's moving from Chemnitz to Dresden, and subsequent difficulties in his early education. His father committed suicide in 1936, and his brother emigrated to Canada in 1937. Coper spent a short period studying textile engineering in Dresden before emigrating to England in 1939. In 1940 he was interned as an enemy alien and sent to Canada, volunteering to return to England to join the Pioneer Corps in 1941. Soon after the war Coper met the &eacute;migr&eacute; Viennese potter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58005/', "Lucie Rie")</script> and with no prior knowledge of pottery joined her studio as an assistant to make ceramic buttons for the fashion industry. Her studio was a meeting-place for European artists and architects and Coper was greatly encouraged in this urbane atmosphere to extend both his ceramic and his drawing skills. Rie's reputation as a potter was based on her austere tableware designs of black and white glazed teapots and coffee cups, decorated with minimal cross-hatching or parallel lines, and Coper helped to throw and decorate them. The tableware stood out at this period against the more orientalist functional pots, heavily glazed in rich earth colours, that were espoused by Bernard Leach and his followers. Coper's developing abilities were recognized by Rie and many of these tableware pieces carry both their personal sealmarks on them.<br>
<br>Coper also began to make less functional ceramics alongside this tableware. These pieces were distinctive and already displayed his sensibility; in particular his fascination with the archaic pots of Greece coupled with an interest in the abstract mark making of such contemporary painters as Marino Marini and Ben Nicholson. The exterior surfaces of these pots were rarely glazed; rather they have dry abraded surfaces into which lines have been scored to make abstracted designs of birds or fish, or patterns reminiscent of webs or nets. Their forms were simple, often bowls or beakers or compounds of two more shapes brought boldly together: all the component parts of his pots were thrown on the potter's wheel, something he believed strongly gave intensity and vigour to the forms. Above all these potters shared the interest in archaic ritual so current among contemporary sculptors. Coper's palette of colours was muted: ochres, browns, and black predominated in these first pots as they were to do throughout his career, their tonality highlighting their connections with more overtly sculptural materials like stone rather than with ceramics. These pots of Coper's made a considerable impact when exhibited at the Festival of Britain in 1951, and subsequently at exhibitions in London with Rie at the Berkeley Galleries in 1954 and 1956. His work began to be collected by notable patrons and it is a marker of his burgeoning reputation that in the first monograph on studio pottery by Muriel Rose published in 1955 ten of Coper's pots were illustrated.<br>
<br>Coper had married Annie Penelope Karaiskos in October 1943 and had a daughter, Ingrid, in 1944. Their marriage was short-lived, a relationship with Dorothy Frances (Francesca) Zobel, formerly Nicholas, starting also in 1943, with two children, Anya and Laurens, being born in 1944 and 1948. In 1954 Coper met the photographer Jane Gate, with whom he was to live for the rest of his life. Jane Gate's photographs of Coper provide a remarkable archive of images of his work in progress in his studios. They married in 1974.<br>
<br>In 1959 Hans Coper moved to a newly inaugurated arts centre at Digswell in Hertfordshire where he was given a studio and flat. Digswell was founded to strengthen connection between the arts and architecture, and in the five years that Coper lived there a substantial proportion of his work was focused on making architectural ceramics. These included cladding tiles for both the exterior and interior of buildings as well as designs for washbasins and lavatories. This kind of work revealed Coper's interest in exactitude and problem solving, as well as a rare sense of engagement with the hardware of buildings. It was during this period that Coper also received the two most significant architectural commissions of his life. The first was to make the candlesticks for the new Coventry Cathedral, designed by Basil Spence, a brief that specified that they should be &#145;in scale with the huge concrete altar &hellip; an ordinary design would look puny. That is the pitfall&#146;  (Whiting, 19). It was a pitfall that he avoided. Coper made them 7 feet tall, slotting multiple thrown sections together on metal rods, a technique that reflected his grasp of engineering as much as of ceramics. His handling of scale is impressive, the candlesticks retaining great presence in their positioning in front of a vast Graham Sutherland tapestry. Spence was to be behind Coper's other great commission, that of two massive candlesticks for the meeting-house at Sussex University (now installed on a Henry Moore altar in St Stephen Walbrook, London). They were conceived as a bowl form raised above a tapered drum-like foot. Glazed with a matt manganese surface, they are magisterial in their austerity.<br>
<br>In 1961 Coper started teaching part-time at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts at the suggestion of Lucie Rie, and at the Royal College of Art in London in 1966. His teaching made a considerable impression on his pupils, who included some of the most significant ceramicists of the 1970s, such as Elizabeth Fritsch, Glenys Barton, and Alison Britton, though their new school of hand-built work often vibrantly painted shared little with Coper's aesthetic. A man of considerable good looks, tall and slightly hunched through a stiffened spine, and with an almost hieratic intensity of manner, Coper inspired great loyalty among those he taught. He was not given to inanity or unnecessary pleasantry when discussing work, and many record that it was his gravitas about the making of ceramics that was so inspirational. The devotion he inspired was described by Barton: &#145;I suddenly felt an urgent need to have something better to show him the next time he came&#146;  (Barton, 54).<br>
<br>Coper returned to London in 1963 and the subsequent four years were to prove some of the most fertile of his life. Coper's characteristic way of working was to make numerous pots in a very small series of forms, intensely revising the shapes and their decoration, and discarding much of his work. When exhibiting his work he preferred to show pots of widely differing scale and tone together to create a complex of formal resonances. His composite forms grew more complex, involving many different thrown sections and sometimes also joining a disc at the rim or at the intersection of two forms. Many of his pots were concerned with contrasting ellipses and flattened volumes, sometimes dramatically indenting or squeezing the forms. Their surfaces were subtler with a pale cream slip used in contrast with the black interiors. Function was no longer of significance (though he continued to suggest that they could be used for flowers or candles), as he developed his increasingly distinctive vocabulary of shapes and surface.<br>
<br>In 1967 Coper had his most important joint European exhibition at the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam with Lucie Rie, for which he made some of the largest pieces of his career. In 1969 he showed with the weaver Peter Collingwood at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In this exhibition he showed elongated forms mounted on very small drum-like bases for the first time. With their submerged anthropomorphism these pots became known as his &#145;Cycladic&#146; pots owing to their resemblance to the archaic figures that partly inspired them. For this exhibition he wrote sparingly about his work, the only time which he did so and about which subsequently he had serious misgivings:<blockquote>My concern is with extracting essence rather than with experiment and exploration. The wheel imposes its economy, dictates limits, provides momentum and continuity. Concentrating on continuous variations of simple themes I became part of the process; I am learning to operate a sensitive instrument which may be resonant to my experience of existence now&#151;in this fantastic century. Practising a craft with ambiguous reference to purpose and function one has occasion to face absurdity. More than anything, somewhat like a phantom piano-tuner, one is trying to approximate a phantom pitch. (Houston, 99)</blockquote>Coper moved to Somerset in 1967. His reputation, always high among a small group of collectors, had now become considerable in Europe and America. Though his work now fetched more money, the intense scrutiny under which he put his work meant that the few pieces he sold brought him no great affluence. He continued to live in an electively spartan manner. It was only after his death that his work became the most expensive of studio ceramics and the subject of fervent speculation. From 1974 there were increasing signs of physical deterioration in his co-ordination, with motor neurone disease diagnosed in 1975. Coper made fewer and fewer pots until in 1979 he ceased completely; he died in Frome, Somerset, on 16 June 1981.<br>
<br>Since his death Coper's reputation among critics and ceramicists has remained steadfast: his work has continued to be perceived as having the greatest sculptural presence among studio potters. Principal collections of Coper's works include those in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Crafts Council, London; the Metropolitan Museum, New York; and the Boymans Museum, Rotterdam.<br>
