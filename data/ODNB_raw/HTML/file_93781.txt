<span class="headword">Sutton,  (Alfred) Shaun Graham</span>  (1919&#150;2004), <span class="occ">television executive and writer</span>, was born on 14 October 1919 at the Parkside Maternity Home, Hammersmith, London, the son of Eric Graham Sutton (1892&#150;1959), schoolmaster and author, and his wife, (Edithe) Beryl, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Astley-Marsden, actress. His father, who was originally from Carlisle, wrote novels under his own name and detective fiction under the pseudonym Anthony Marsden. Shaun Sutton grew up in London and was educated at Latymer Upper School (where his father taught him Latin) and the Embassy School of Acting. He learned his craft as an actor and stage manager at various London theatres until, in 1940, he joined the Royal Navy. He served in cruisers and destroyers, was on board a ship sunk in the Mediterranean, and survived the Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union. Discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant, he went back to the Embassy Theatre, north London, and looked set for a modest career in repertory. On 1 September 1948 he married Barbara Leslie, a 25-year-old actress and the daughter of the late Howard Leslie, who had been a theatrical manager. Sutton had previously been married to Peggy Emily Rosemary Martin, from whom he was divorced. With Barbara Leslie he had a son and three daughters. In 1950 the couple toured in South Africa and met a young actor, Nigel Hawthorne, whom they helped to gain a place at the Embassy.<br>
<br>In 1952 Sutton's career took an important turn when a friend suggested that he stand in for him in a production for the BBC's television service. He made his television d&eacute;but as an assistant director and small-part actor in a live production of <span class="italic">Huckleberry Finn</span> broadcast from Alexandra Palace. Over the next decade, and alongside several more performances in front of the camera, he became proficient in television by writing and directing children's drama. Among these programmes were a dozen episodes of the <span class="roman">Billy Bunter</span> series, <span class="italic">The Silver Sword</span> (1957), based on the novel by Ian Serraillier, and a children's comedy, <span class="italic">Bonehead</span> (1960&#150;62), which he also wrote.<br>
<br>In 1962 Sutton's experience led to his being offered one of the original directorial positions on <span class="italic">Z Cars</span>, a twice-weekly series that broke new ground in the dramatic depiction of the police force. Sutton directed twenty-four early episodes and also worked on the spin-off series, <span class="italic">Softly Softly</span> (1966&#150;70). In January 1963 the arrival of Sydney Newman as the BBC's head of drama added significantly to the impact that television drama was making. Newman reorganized his group into three departments, plays, series, and serials, and in 1966 appointed Sutton as head of serials. He began with a lucky break: <span class="italic">The Forsyte Saga</span>, produced by Donald Wilson, was already in the pipeline and the twenty-six-episode adaptation of John Galsworthy's story became one of the BBC's biggest hits when it was screened in the following year.<br>
<br>In 1969 Sutton was appointed head of the BBC's drama group in the wake of Newman's move into film production eighteen months earlier. Sutton's ensuing eleven years as head of drama were characterized by a more collegiate style than that favoured by his rumbustious predecessor; the three drama departments were allowed considerable freedom and they prospered. One subtle change underlined Sutton's diplomacy. In 1970 he replaced the <span class="roman">Wednesday Play</span>&#151;which, though critically acclaimed and popular, had its detractors, notably Mrs Mary Whitehouse&#151;with <span class="roman">Play for Today</span>, which, just as challenging, provided opportunities for such new writers as Alan Bennett and Alan Bleasdale.<br>
<br>Sutton was now in command of what he rightly called the &#145;largest theatre in the world&#146; and under his benign but firm leadership some 650 episodes of series and serials, along with 100 single plays, were screened annually. This was a time when numerous talented authors wished to write for the BBC, among them Dennis Potter, David Mercer, Peter Terson, Alan Plater, Fay Weldon, and Julia Jones. His group of producers and directors, including Tony Garnett, Ken Loach, and Kenith Trodd, may have been more aggressive and more politically minded than Sutton, but they were loyal to him and he, and they, knew where the line was drawn. Sutton's years as head of drama also brought innovations, including a notable rise in the number of new drama productions made outside London, particularly in Birmingham (under David Rose, his mentor on <span class="italic">Z Cars</span>) and in Belfast. Overall his leadership was responsible for productions that were authoritative, adventurous, and popular, and included series such as <span class="italic">The Onedin Line</span> (1971&#150;80), <span class="italic">Colditz</span> (1972&#150;4), <span class="italic">When the Boat Comes In</span> (1976&#150;81), and <span class="italic">All Creatures Great and Small</span> (1978&#150;90), and television plays including <span class="italic">Bar Mitzvah Boy</span> (1976), <span class="italic">Abigail's Party</span> (1977), and <span class="italic">Blue Remembered Hills</span> (1979).<br>
<br>Sutton, who was proud of never having been on the staff of the BBC, retired from his executive post in 1981, only to begin work on the BBC Shakespeare project. Between 1982 and 1984 he produced television adaptations of fourteen Shakespeare plays and then, aged sixty-five, went on to produce BBC2's <span class="italic">Theatre Night</span>, which featured works by Moli&egrave;re, Ibsen, and Bernard Shaw alongside Joe Orton, David Storey, Michael Frayn, and Alan Ayckbourn.<br>
<br>Sutton was a tall, slim man who never seemed to age. He was an amiable figure, with a fund of theatrical stories, who was popular with staff at the BBC's Television Centre and with European colleagues whom he met at the annual Prix Italia festival. He remained involved in television and theatrical productions after his retirement to Trunch in Norfolk. He was appointed OBE in 1979 and his brisk guide to television drama, <span class="italic">The Largest Theatre in the World</span>, was published in 1982. He died from multi-organ failure on 14 May 2004 at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Colney. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, and their four children.<br>
