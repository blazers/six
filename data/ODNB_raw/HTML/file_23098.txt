<span class="headword">Ramsay,  Thomas Kennedy</span>  (1826&#150;1886), <span class="occ">judge and jurist in Canada</span>, born in Ayr on 2 September 1826, was the third son of David Ramsay, writer to the signet, of Grimmat in the parish of Straiton, Ayrshire. His mother was the daughter of Thomas Kennedy of Kirkmechan House, Ayr; she died in 1878. The family moved to St John's, Maryhill, where Ramsay began his education under private tutors; later he attended Madras College, St Andrews, then Ayr Academy, and completed his education in France. In 1847 he and his family migrated to Canada and settled on the estate of St Hugues in Quebec. After studying law in the office of Meredith, Bethune, and Dunkin, solicitors, he was admitted to the bar in 1852, and soon had a thriving practice. He was also an active contributor to the press; for a time he helped manage <span class="italic">La Patrie</span>, in which he fought the battle of the seigneurs (landed proprietors) with substantial success. He was himself owner of part of the Ramezay seigneury. He was co-founder and editor of the <span class="italic">Law Reporter</span> in 1854, and aided in establishing the <span class="italic">Lower Canada Jurist</span> in 1857. In 1859, because of his sound knowledge of French and English, he was appointed secretary of the commission for the codification of the civil law of Lower Canada, but in 1862 he was dismissed, allegedly because his very conservative political views were unacceptable. He taught civil law briefly in Morrin College, Quebec City, and in 1863 and 1867 he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative in elections to the assembly. From 1864 to 1868 he was crown prosecutor at Montreal, and in this capacity in 1866 he prosecuted the Fenian raiders charged with invading Lower Canada at Sweetsburg. In 1867 he became QC.<br>
<br>In 1870 Ramsay was appointed an assistant justice of the superior court of Quebec, and in 1873 a puisne judge of the court of queen's bench for the dominion. His industry was immense and he spent great pains upon his judgments, invariably writing them out. Especially well read in Roman law, he wrote various pamphlets on legal subjects. His only relaxation was farming his estate at St Hugues. He died suddenly while still serving on the bench on 22 December 1886. He was unmarried. He was buried at the Mount Royal cemetery, Montreal. In an obituary he was described as &#145;one of [Canada's] ablest lawyers and its most irascible judge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Montreal Daily Star</span>).<br>
