<span class="headword">Hill, Sir  Rowland</span>  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1561), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, was born at Hodnet, Shropshire, the eldest son of Thomas Hill and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of Thomas Wilbraham of Woodhey, Cheshire. He was apprenticed to the London mercer Thomas Kitson, and obtained his freedom in 1519. He then became a leading merchant adventurer, exporting broadcloths to Flanders and importing linens and fustians, his growing wealth indicated by his subsidy assessments, which rose from &pound;150 in goods in the mid-1520s to 5000 marks in goods in 1541 (only two other men in London were assessed so high). For the bulk of his civic career the centre of his business operations was the parish of St Stephen Walbrook, in which he acted as churchwarden in 1525&#150;6 and where he owned a property fronting onto Walbrook. But he also retained an interest in the Welsh marches, and acquired extensive estates in Shropshire, Cheshire, Flintshire, and Staffordshire; between 1539 and 1547 he purchased large quantities of former monastic property. His power in his native county was reflected in his appearance on the Shropshire commission of the peace between 1543 and 1554.<br>
<br>The bulk of Hill's administrative energies were directed to the capital. He was prominent in the affairs of the Mercers' Company, serving as warden in 1535&#150;6, and as master in 1543&#150;4, in 1550&#150;51, in 1555&#150;6, and again in 1560&#150;61. As sheriff in 1541&#150;2 he endured a brief period (28&#150;30 March 1542) of imprisonment in the Tower of London on the orders of the House of Commons for his abuse of the serjeant of parliament sent to secure the release of George Ferrers, a member of parliament imprisoned for debt in the Bread Street Counter. Although the king backed the Commons in this case of member's privilege, he showed favour to Hill shortly after the affair by knighting him, on 18 May 1542, during the prorogation of the parliament. Hill was elected to the court of aldermen on 9 November 1542, and served successively for the wards of Castle Baynard (1542&#150;6) and Walbrook (1546&#150;61). He took over as lord mayor for the year beginning in November 1549 in the wake of the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> against Protector Somerset and in the midst of a period of religious uncertainty, but he oversaw some of the critical changes in the direction of godly protestantism, including the removal of altars. His mayoralty was also noted for the repurchasing by the livery companies of chantry properties seized by the crown in 1548, an initiative that was organized by the court of aldermen, and for the City's purchase in May 1550 of the former manors of Bermondsey Priory (now known as the King's Manor) and the archbishop of Canterbury (now known as the Great Liberty manor) in Southwark, together with a charter giving the aldermen extended powers over the troublesome southern suburbs. He remained an assiduous member of the court of aldermen, and attended nearly two-thirds of the meetings in the reigns of both Edward VI and Mary. He may have endured a spell of disfavour under Mary, but, although dropped from the commissions of the peace for Middlesex and Shropshire in 1554, he had recovered the regime's confidence by 1557, when he was nominated as a commissioner for the investigation of heretics.<br>
<br>Hill enjoyed an enviable reputation for charitable virtue. &#145;Grett mon was mad for ys deth, and he gayff myche to the pore&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 272). Although he had accumulated extensive estates, he was remembered as a paternalistic landlord who had neither raised rents nor levied entry fines. As tenant from the Mercers' Company of the precinct of the hospital of St Thomas Acre from 1542, he undertook to maintain its school, and he seems to have moved it at his own expense from the cloister into new quarters in a room on the north side of the choir or chancel. In 1555 he established a school at Market Drayton in his native Shropshire. He was also closely involved with the establishment of the London hospitals. He was the president of Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals from 1557 to 1558 and again between 1559 and 1561, and he held the post of surveyor-general of the London hospitals from 1559 until his death. But his charity had a stern edge, for he also enjoyed a reputation as &#145;a foe to vice and a vehement corrector&#146;  (notes on his monument at St Stephen Walbrook, London, Mercers' Hall). His mayoralty witnessed a determined campaign against moral offences, the wardmote inquests being required in April 1550 to make fresh presentments of ill rule, &#145;upon which indictments the lord mayor sat many times&#146;  (Hume, 167&#150;9). The crusade was controversial because of Hill's readiness to punish wealthy offenders. Perhaps because of this determined moralism, which seems to have owed something to pressure from the protestant pulpits, and perhaps because of the coincidence of his mayoralty with a decisive turn in the English Reformation, Hill is often described as the first protestant lord mayor of London, but this tradition seems to date from no earlier than 1795, when a descendant, Sir Rowland Hill, bt, erected an obelisk to his memory in Hawkstone Park, Shropshire. Although he was one of the City's representatives in the first parliament of Mary's reign (October&#150;December 1553), Hill is not named as one of those &#145;which stood for the trewe religion&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS e Museo 17). His will gives little indication of fervent protestantism, and there was no celebration of godly values in either the memorial tablet in St Stephen Walbrook or in the inscription on the portrait at Mercers' Hall. His arrangement for the distribution of a dole of 12<i>d</i>. a house through the wards of the City as he lay dying was characteristic of his charity, but also redolent of an older type of piety. His interest in innovative charitable projects and in education may have owed more to the humanist values fashionable in London circles at this time than to protestantism.<br>
<br>Hill was married by 1542, but the identity of his wife, who died during his mayoralty, is unknown. There were no surviving children. He died at midnight on 28 October 1561, according to Machyn, &#145;of the strangwyllyon&#146; (strangury, a disease of the urinary organs) , and was buried on 5 November in the parish church of St Stephen Walbrook. The bulk of his property passed to his nieces, one of whom married the judge Sir Reginald Corbet and another Hill's fellow alderman and &#145;most suer and faithfull friende&#146; Sir Thomas Leigh.<br>
