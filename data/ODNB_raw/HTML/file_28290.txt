<span class="headword">Villiers <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Hamilton]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, countess of Orkney  (<em>c.</em>1657&#150;1733), <span class="occ">presumed mistress of William III</span>, was the eldest daughter of Sir Edward Villiers (1620&#150;1689) of Richmond, Surrey, knight marshal of England. Her mother, Frances (1630&#150;1677), was the daughter of Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk, and governess to princesses Mary and Anne. Upon Princess Mary's marriage to William of Orange [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29450/', "William III and II")</script>] in 1677 Villiers accompanied her to The Hague. In 1685 rumours about Villiers's intimacy with Mary's husband reached the ears of James II's ambassador Bevil Skelton, who (it was said) sought to drive a wedge between the prince and princess of Orange. As a result, Villiers was expelled from the royal household, along with the servants and chaplain who had conveyed the gossip. Villiers none the less maintained some sort of relationship with William until Mary's death in 1694, when, according to William Whiston, Archbishop Tenison persuaded the widowed king to break off all contact with her. On 25 November 1695 Villiers married the distinguished soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12069/', "Lord George Hamilton (bap. 1666, d. 1737)")</script>, who was created earl of Orkney five and a half weeks later. They had several children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68364/', "Frances Lumley-Saunderson")</script>.<br>
<br>Villiers's status as William's mistress was commonly enough regarded as fact in the eighteenth century for Horace Walpole to repeat the story that Catherine Sedley, upon meeting Elizabeth Villiers and the duchess of Portsmouth in a drawing-room at Windsor, cried &#145;God! who would have thought that we three royal whores should meet <i>here</i>&#146;  (Walpole, 33.529). But unlike the mistresses of Charles II, she attracted little public comment in William's lifetime. The king was more commonly satirized by his enemies as a sodomite rather than a heterosexual adulterer, while his supporters would not jeopardize the politically useful image of the royal couple as models of conjugal love and moral probity.<br>
<br>Villiers did receive unwelcome public attention during William's reign as a result of the king's gift to her of lands in Ireland formerly belonging to James II. In 1699 the commissioners appointed by parliament to investigate the fate of the Irish lands forfeited by Jacobites gratuitously included in their report a final paragraph estimating that the countess of Orkney's property was worth &pound;26,000, a figure which the government claimed was grossly exaggerated by the &#145;country&#146; party in order to embarrass the king. The lands were then resumed to public use, but Villiers may have been compensated for her loss by payments of &pound;13,000 out of secret service funds in 1701 and 1702. Her lasting contribution to Ireland (or to English interests therein) was the generous endowment of a school at Middletown, Cork, in 1709.<br>
<br>Villiers has often been portrayed as a political intriguer, but evidence of her role is elusive. She doubtless politicked actively to protect her Irish lands. But of her alleged part in Marlborough's fall from favour in 1692 there is little proof beyond the duchess of Marlborough's remark that &#145;Mrs. Villiers &hellip; was my implacable enemy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marlborough&#150;Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 41). The story that Villiers deliberately promoted Arnold Joost van Keppel, who became earl of Albemarle, in William's affections in order to undermine the power of her hated brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2160/', "William Bentinck, earl of Portland")</script>, is perhaps substantiated by a letter of Charles Montagu to Shrewsbury reporting that &#145;my lord W[harton] has been framing a new scheme, in concert with a fair lady, to make my Lord Albemarle the minister&#146;  (Coxe, 533). Her most well-documented political act was her attempt, carried out with great charm but no immediate success, to persuade the earl of Shrewsbury to become secretary of state in 1693&#150;4. The friendship between Villiers and Shrewsbury continued, at least intermittently: in 1710 Godolphin warned Marlborough that &#145;[Orkney's] lady and [Shrewsbury] are all one, and both of them extremely meddling, and 'tis hard to determine which is the greater politician&#146;  (Snyder, 3.1497).<br>
<br>As Godolphin's letter suggests, Lady Orkney's loyalties in Anne's reign were not rigid. Her letters to Harley, although they hardly substantiate Swift's claim that &#145;her advice [was] asked and followed in the most important affairs of state&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, 5.224), suggest she was sympathetic to Harley's goals and eager to cultivate his favour. Yet, she was also spotted in the company of Harley's enemy the duchess of Marlborough, offering &#145;a health to her and all that's for the Duke's interest, and total destruction to those that are not for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 4.542). It is likely that she kept a foot in each camp.<br>
<br>In the Hanoverian era Lady Orkney remained in the social orbit of the court, hosting both George I and George II at her estate at Cliveden in south Buckinghamshire, on the Thames near Maidenhead. When she appeared at the coronation of George II in 1727 her physical appearance, never regarded as her best asset, was mocked by Mary Wortley Montagu, who gleefully described her &#145;mixture of fat and wrinkles &hellip; considerable pair of bubbys a good deal withered, a great belly that preceded her &hellip; the inimitable roll of her eyes, and her grey hair which by good fortune stood directly upright&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Letters</span>, 2.85&#150;6). She died on 19 April 1733 in Albemarle Street, London, and was buried at Taplow, Buckinghamshire, six days later. Her eldest daughter inherited the Orkney title.<br>
<br>Like many women of her generation, Villiers expressed herself primarily in conversation rather than writing. Observers as different as Jonathan Swift, who considered her &#145;the wisest woman I ever saw&#146;  (Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, 2.558), and the duchess of Marlborough agreed that she was an exceptionally good talker. Only a few of her letters survive. They suggest personal warmth, an interest (though not powerful influence) in politics, and an appealing lack of self-importance. It is a pity there are not more of them; in the absence of a written record, Villiers will remain someone about whom much is said and little known.<br>
