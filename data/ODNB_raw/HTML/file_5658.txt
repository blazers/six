<span class="headword">Clifford,  Robert</span>, first Lord Clifford  (1274&#150;1314), <span class="occ">soldier and magnate</span>, was born about the beginning of April 1274, the son of Roger de Clifford the younger (<i>d</i>. 1282) and his wife, Isabella de Vieuxpont (<i>d</i>. 1291), coheir with her sister Idonea to the lordship of Westmorland. The Cliffords had previously been a family powerful in the Anglo-Welsh marches. The Vieuxpont marriage led to their becoming one of the most important northern baronial dynasties. Aged only eight when his father was killed in Wales, Robert Clifford's wardship appears to have been granted to Edmund of Cornwall, the king's brother, but to have been effectively disposed of by Robert's mother, who entrusted the upbringing of her son to Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1295); only in 1291 did Edmund recover the custody. In 1294 Clifford was said to be in the king's wardship, and he was with Edward I in Wales in the spring of 1295. He had livery of his estates on 3 May 1295, but was still trying to recover usurpations suffered during his lengthy minority more than fifteen years later. The task was complicated by the demands of war and public office in Scotland and the north of England, almost as soon as Clifford entered upon his inheritance. In 1296 he accompanied the king to Scotland, and in July 1297 he was appointed captain of the king's castles in Cumberland. At the end of that year he led a destructive raid into Annandale which defeated the local levies and burnt ten villages. In the following February another raid left Annan in ashes.<br>
<br>On 22 July 1298 Clifford fought at Falkirk as a household banneret, and after the victory, on 25 November, he was made captain and king's lieutenant in north-west England and in Scotland to the boundaries of Roxburghshire, an office he still held in the following July. Nor was this the only responsibility entrusted to him, for on 7 July 1298 he became keeper of Nottingham Castle and justice of the forests north of the Trent, positions he would occupy to the end of the reign. As a reward for his labours, on 26 September 1298 Edward I granted Clifford Caerlaverock Castle and the lands of Sir William Douglas, in the process initiating a feud between the Cliffords and the Douglases which would last for a century. A series of personal summonses to parliament which began on 29 December 1299 has led to his being styled Lord Clifford. In 1300 he accompanied the king on the Caerlaverock campaign. He engaged himself to serve in Scotland over the winter of 1301&#150;2, and accompanied the king there in 1304, participating in a successful attack on the Scots near Peebles about 1 March. Later that year he joined the forces of the prince of Wales, and with them took part in the siege of Stirling Castle. But though he remained close to Prince Edward, who in August 1305 described him as &#145;our dear and well loved knight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Edward, Prince of Wales</span>, 92), he also continued to serve the king, on whose behalf he was keeper of the see of Durham in 1302&#150;3 and 1305&#150;7, and by March 1306 he was back in Scotland, as keeper of Selkirk. Shortly afterwards he was one of the English captains ordered to attack the rebellious Robert Bruce, and in February 1307 is recorded as pursuing Robert in Galloway. He was unable, however, to prevent James Douglas from capturing Douglas Castle and massacring the garrison that Clifford had placed in it.<br>
<br>Loyal and energetic service to Edward I did not hinder Clifford from safeguarding and extending his own interests in the north of England. In May 1306 he was granted Hart and Hartlepool in the bishopric of Durham, forfeited by Robert Bruce, and in February 1307 the king gave him lands in Cumberland forfeited by Sir Christopher Seton. But Westmorland remained fundamental to his regional standing and authority, and he enhanced his position there by adding to his estates (he acquired the manor of Brough Sowerby in 1298), by building up a loyal following among the gentry of the region, several of whom served repeatedly under his leadership in Scotland, and by the prestige to be had from large-scale architectural projects. In the years around 1300, possibly as a result of a visit in that year by Edward I and his court, Clifford made substantial additions to Brougham Castle, finally gaining the seal of royal approval in the form of a licence to crenellate in 1309.<br>
<br>Trusted by Edward I and close to Prince Edward, Clifford was one of four leading barons whom the former on his deathbed is said to have begged to have the prince crowned as soon as possible, and to keep Piers Gaveston out of England&#151;&#145;and thai grantede him with god wille&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: England</span>, 1.202&#150;3). Early in the new reign Clifford was appointed marshal of England, and presumably organized Edward II's coronation on 25 February 1308. He had already subscribed to the declaration issued by a number of barons at Boulogne on 31 January, undertaking to preserve the rights of the crown, thereby suggesting his willingness to support the new king in the face of mounting baronial discontent. On 12 March 1308 he was relieved simultaneously of the marshalcy, Nottingham Castle, and his forest justiceship, but this can hardly be construed as resulting from loss of favour at court, for on 20 August he was appointed captain and chief guardian of Scotland. On 13 October, moreover, it was &#145;by the command of our lord the king&#146;  (books of record, 2.66&#150;7) that he concluded negotiations with his maternal aunt Idonea and her second husband, John Cromwell, which resulted in his reuniting the lordship of Westmorland, divided since the mid-1260s. More probably Edward II had decided to build up Clifford's position in the north of England, at a time when the English position in Scotland was coming under growing pressure. It is likely to have been for the same reason that a sequence of three royal grants made between March and September 1310 gave him the castle and honour of Skipton in Craven in Yorkshire. He subsequently carried out important works on Skipton Castle. That his daughter Idonea should have married Henry Percy, second Lord Percy, with whose father Clifford many times campaigned against the Scots, is a pointer to the extent to which he came to identify himself with the nobility of northern England.<br>
<br>Clifford served regularly in Scotland and on the Scottish borders in the early years of Edward II's reign. On 26 October 1309 he was appointed keeper of the Carlisle march, and on 20 December following was ordered to act as warden of Scotland, with a force of 100 men-at-arms and 300 foot soldiers. He had relinquished that office by 1 April 1310, but on 17 July received a protection as he was about to set out for Scotland, and was said to have parleyed with King Robert at Selkirk in December. On 4 April 1311 he was appointed keeper of Scotland south of the Forth, with his headquarters at Berwick, and in November led a raid upon the Scots in which eleven of his knights lost their horses. But he was increasingly distracted from his duties in the north by his involvement in English politics, particularly as these were directed against Piers Gaveston. Clifford may have been influenced in this by the grant to Gaveston of the honour of Penrith in December 1310, perhaps fearing that Gaveston might become his rival for pre-eminence in north-west England. But as Gaveston had formerly held the more valuable lordship of Skipton, subsequently granted to Clifford, the latter had arguably gained more from royal favour, and it is likely that Clifford was moved principally by the general baronial hostility towards the favourite, and by his own undertaking to the king's father. He was not one of the ordainers, and Edward II probably regarded him as basically well disposed; when Skipton was resumed under the ordinances on 21 October 1311, it was restored to Clifford on 13 November following.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Clifford was active against Gaveston in 1312, holding the borders to prevent his seeking Scottish aid, and later besieging him in Scarborough Castle. Though not involved in Gaveston's death, he appears to have taken some of the valuables that the king and Gaveston abandoned in Newcastle&#151;some jewels were later returned to Edward from Clifford's London house. Gaveston was executed on 19 July 1312, and for over a year Clifford was continually active as an intermediary on behalf of the earls of Lancaster and Warwick in their negotiations with the king, receiving a series of safe conducts and letters of protection. On 14 October 1313 the barons responsible for Gaveston's death received pardons, and two days later Clifford himself obtained a general pardon. Although the reconciliation between the king and his leading opponents was superficial, it allowed Edward II to turn his attention to Scotland. Summoned to attend a muster at Berwick on 10 June 1314, Clifford took part in the campaign that culminated in the battle of Bannockburn. On the day before the main engagement, he was one of two leaders of an English force that tried to get behind the Scottish force drawn up in front of Stirling Castle, either to cut off its retreat or to make contact with the castle garrison. But his men could not break the ranks of the enemy infantry, and were eventually scattered; Clifford's own withdrawal was regarded by one chronicler as shameful&#151;he had been &#145;disgracefully routed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span>, 51). Perhaps anxiety to recover his honour made him over-impetuous, for on the following day, 24 June, he charged into action in the English vanguard and was killed.<br>
<br>The Scottish king demanded no ransom for the return of Clifford's body, which was taken to Carlisle, and almost certainly interred at Shap Abbey, where Clifford had founded a chantry for his parents. By 1295 he had married Maud, daughter of Thomas de Clare of Thomond, the brother of the earl of Gloucester in whose household Clifford was brought up. The marriage brought the Cliffords Irish estates of greater potential than actual value. Robert and Maud Clifford had two sons, Roger (<i>d</i>. 1322) and Robert (<i>d</i>. 1344), both minors at their father's death. A daughter, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1382), married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61252/', "Peter (V) Mauley, third Lord Mauley")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54530/', "Mauley family")</script>]. Roger Clifford became the ward of Sir Bartholomew Badlesmere, whose influence doubtless helped carry him into opposition to the crown. A committed Lancastrian, in 1322 Roger fought in the baronial army at Boroughbridge, where he was wounded and captured. He was hanged at York on 23 March. The Clifford estates, forfeited for Roger's treason, were restored in 1327 to his brother Robert, with whose descendants the Clifford line continued. Maud Clifford, forcibly abducted in 1315 by Jack the Irishman, the keeper of Barnard Castle, married Sir Robert Welle, one of her rescuers, and died in 1325. Her first husband seems to have been widely trusted and admired. His martial prowess was acknowledged by the Scots: for John Barbour he was &#145;The lord clyffurd that wes so stout&#146;  (Barbour, 1.277). And the <span class="italic">Song of Caerlaverock</span> (admittedly a work that Clifford may have sponsored himself) praises his wisdom and prudence, describes his &#145;much honoured banner&#146;, and declares that &#145;If I were a young maiden I would give him my heart and person, so good is his fame&#146;  (<span class="italic">Roll of Caerlaverock</span>, 12).<br>
