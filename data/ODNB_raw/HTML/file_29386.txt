</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilberforce,  William</span>  (1759&#150;1833), <span class="occ">politician, philanthropist, and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born on 24 August 1759 at the Wilberforce house in High Street, Hull, the third child and only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728&#150;1768), merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1798), daughter of Thomas Bird, of Barton, Oxfordshire. His paternal grandfather, William Wilberforce (1690&#150;1776), established the family fortunes through the Baltic trade, acquired Yorkshire landed property, and was twice mayor of Hull. The younger William had three sisters, but only one of these, Sarah (1758&#150;1816), survived to adulthood.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer17591784"></a>Education and early career, 1759&#150;1784</h2>William was a small and delicate child, but precocious. He was first educated, in 1767&#150;8, at Hull grammar school. There, under the tuition of Joseph and Isaac Milner, he was set on a table and made to &#145;read aloud as an example to the other boys&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 1.4). In 1768, because of his father's premature death, he was sent to live with an uncle, also William Wilberforce, and his wife, Hannah, at their homes in St James's Place, London, and in Wimbledon. During the following two years he attended Mr Chalmers's school in Putney, which he later described as &#145;very indifferent&#146;  (Harford, 197). Meanwhile his aunt Hannah, an admirer of George Whitefield and friendly with the Methodists, influenced him towards evangelicalism. His grandfather and mother, however, took fright, and brought him back to live in Hull, where every effort was made to distract him from such enthusiastic religion. In the short term these endeavours appeared successful, and during his teenage years William spent his holidays immersed in the lively social round of Hull while continuing his education, from 1771 to 1776, as a boarder at Pocklington School.<br>
<br>Wilberforce entered St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1776. His quick intelligence and substantial fortune, augmented by the deaths of his grandfather in 1776 and his childless uncle William in 1777, relieved him of any necessity for applying himself to hard study. His undergraduate years were therefore spent in an atmosphere of easy-going sociability, although he regarded the more dissipated extremes of university life with distaste. He took his BA in 1781 and his MA in 1788.<br>
<br>Wilberforce showed little inclination to involve himself actively in the family business, and while still at Cambridge he resolved to pursue a political career. In September 1780, when barely twenty-one, he was elected MP for Hull. In the House of Commons, free from any financial need to obtain public office, he adopted an independent stance from the outset. His earliest recorded interventions in debate, on smuggling and on naval shipbuilding, reflected the maritime interests of his constituency. He became a member of several clubs, notably Goostree's, the focus for a circle of about twenty-five young members. A particularly significant friendship was established with his Cambridge contemporary William Pitt the younger, who regularly stayed with Wilberforce at his house in Wimbledon inherited from his uncle. Pitt, Wilberforce, and Edward Eliot travelled to France together in autumn 1783.<br>
<br>After Pitt became prime minister in December 1783, Wilberforce, albeit without government office, was a key supporter of his minority government in its difficult early months. In particular, on 25 March 1784 he delivered a powerfully effective speech at the Yorkshire county meeting in the Castle Yard at York, being dramatically interrupted by the arrival of a messenger with news of the dissolution of parliament, which Wilberforce himself announced to the assembled freeholders. Having thus brought himself prominently to public attention, Wilberforce rapidly emerged as a compromise Pittite candidate for Yorkshire at the ensuing general election. On 6 April the Foxites conceded defeat, and he returned to the Commons as a representative of England's largest county&#151;a remarkable achievement for a man without major landed interests who was not yet twenty-five. At the time this success seemed fully to open his way to the fulfilment of conventional ambition; in the event it was to provide him with the independent political weight required for a career that took a very different course.<h2>
<a name="LaunchingChristianreform17851789"></a>Launching Christian reform, 1785&#150;1789</h2>Wilberforce's boyish encounter with evangelicalism appeared in his late teens and early twenties to have been a passing phase, and he later recalled that he &#145;had imbibed sceptical notions, and had hired a sitting at Lindsey's Unitarian Chapel&#146;  (Harford, 206). In 1785, primarily through the influence of Isaac Milner, later dean of Carlisle, with whom he travelled on two extended continental tours, he became convinced that mainstream Christian doctrine was true. He then went through an evangelical conversion experience, lamenting the perceived futility of his past life, absorbing &#145;the infinite love, that Christ should die to save such a sinner&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 1.91). From this followed a resolution to commit his future life wholly to the service of God. He sought spiritual advice from the leading evangelical clergyman John Newton, whom he had encountered as a boy, and who now strongly counselled him to remain in politics. This influence was reinforced from a different quarter by that of Pitt, who warned him against rendering his &#145;talents useless both to yourself and mankind&#146;  (Pollock, 38). Hence Wilberforce resolved not to withdraw from public life, but rather to perform his parliamentary duties &#145;with increased diligence and conscientiousness&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wilberforce c. 49, fol. 14).<br>
<br>The gregariousness, generous hospitality, and liveliness in conversation that had characterized Wilberforce before 1785 persisted after his conversion. Though he himself was prone to regard such attributes as evidence of spiritual declension, they were in fact powerful tools for motivating others and gaining affection and co-operation. His effectiveness as a parliamentary leader, and more broadly as an agent of national religious and moral revival, stemmed from his capacity to combine spiritual earnestness with charm, tact, and lightness of touch in human relationships. At the same time his Christian convictions, and his sense of the ultimate significance and rightness of his causes, ensured a fundamental integrity and a dogged readiness to persist in the face of repeated set-backs.<br>
<br>In the short term, however, there were some false starts. In the parliamentary session of 1786 Wilberforce brought forward a bill on the criminal law designed to reduce the sentence on women convicted of treason from burning to hanging, and to extend dissection after execution from murderers to rapists, arsonists, burglars, and robbers. It passed the Commons but was thrown out by the Lords. He also introduced a <span class="roman">Registration Bill</span>, providing for the registration of all freeholders, and for the taking of polls in several centres across a county on the same day, rather than&#151;as then happened&#151;only in the county town over several days. Again the measure was lost in the Lords. The tentative and unsuccessful nature of these forays into humanitarian and parliamentary reform was a sign of Wilberforce's good intentions, but also of his lack of experience and his inability immediately to find compelling causes on which to focus his energies.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, at the end of 1786 Wilberforce demonstrated the strength of his commitment to political life by taking the lease of a house in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, close to parliament, and deciding to sell the house in Wimbledon that had hitherto been his main home. For the next five years he lacked any other permanent residence of his own, and when away from Westminster drew on the extended hospitality of his numerous friends. In particular John Thornton, a fellow evangelical and half-brother of his aunt Hannah, gave him the regular use of a room at his home in Clapham.<br>
<br>It was in 1787 that the concerns that dominated the rest of Wilberforce's life became clear. First, through a variety of channels, particularly association with the circle around Sir Charles and Lady Middleton, and visits from Thomas Clarkson, Wilberforce's hitherto vague concern for the welfare of slaves was transformed into sustained leadership of the parliamentary campaign for the abolition of the slave trade. He had already begun to collect evidence when his decision was catalysed by a conversation with Pitt and William Grenville in May 1787, under what came to be called the &#145;Wilberforce oak&#146; at Holwood in Kent, when the prime minister urged Wilberforce to make the cause his own. While others, notably Clarkson, worked on gathering evidence and mobilizing public opinion through the committee for the abolition of the slave trade, Wilberforce complemented their work through his exertions in the House of Commons. Second, he meanwhile purposefully lobbied bishops and prominent laymen to secure the issue by the king on 1 June 1787 of a proclamation for the encouragement of piety and virtue; this followed earlier precedents, but reflected the perception of Wilberforce and others that the tide of vice and immorality was rising. He then in the latter part of 1787 engaged in hectic travelling around the country, soliciting the support of further notables. He successfully established a society to promote the implementation of the proclamation and hence to be an agency of moral reformation. On 28 October he wrote in his journal that &#145;God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the slave trade and the reformation of manners&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 1.149).<br>
<br>Wilberforce gave notice of a parliamentary motion on the abolition of the slave trade for early in 1788, but his exertions in 1787, following on the upheaval of his spiritual crisis of 1785&#150;6, precipitated in February 1788 a serious stress-related illness, probably ulcerative colitis, that incapacitated him for several months. At one point he was thought to be dying, but he slowly recovered, spending his convalescence at Bath and Cambridge. At this time he began the regular moderate use of opium, which continued for the remainder of his life, and proved an effective treatment for his recurrent nervous and intestinal disorders.<br>
<br>In Wilberforce's absence, Pitt advanced the anti-slave-trade cause by ordering an investigation by the privy council, and then, in May 1788, moving for one by the House of Commons. The subsequent debate revealed considerable support for abolition. Also passed was a bill, promoted by Sir William Dolben, to regulate the capacity of slave ships in order to improve the conditions of the slaves. Following the publication of the privy council report on 25 April 1789, Wilberforce marked his own delayed formal entry into the parliamentary campaign on 12 May with a closely reasoned speech of three and a half hours, using its evidence to describe the effects of the trade on Africa and the appalling conditions of the middle passage. He argued that abolition would lead to an improvement in the conditions of slaves already in the West Indies, and sought to answer the economic arguments of his opponents. For him, however, the fundamental issue was one of morality and justice. He concluded by moving twelve resolutions condemning the trade. These, though, were never discussed. Concerns about economic consequences rendered the house receptive to the stance of the trade's supporters: that more evidence was needed before a responsible decision could be taken. The matter was adjourned to the next session, but Wilberforce had convincingly launched the parliamentary campaign that dominated his life for the next eighteen years.<h2>
<a name="Laboursandsetbacks17901797"></a>Labours and set-backs, 1790&#150;1797</h2>In January 1790 Wilberforce secured a select committee to examine the evidence on the slave trade. Throughout the ensuing parliamentary session he assiduously participated in its proceedings, while his house in Old Palace Yard was a centre of activity for the abolitionists. The general election of June 1790, in which he was returned again for Yorkshire without a contest, prevented further progress that year. In October and November, however, his usual autumn wanderings were broken by an extended stay at Yoxall Lodge in Staffordshire, the home of his Cambridge friend Thomas Gisborne. Here, with the assistance of Thomas Babington, Wilberforce worked extremely hard to assimilate and condense the vast quantity of information generated by the select committee.<br>
<br>The select committee resumed its deliberations in February 1791, and Wilberforce, encouraged by a letter from the dying John Wesley, returned to his assiduous gathering of material. On 18 April, in a four-hour speech that showed his mastery of the evidence and arguments, he moved for leave to bring in an <span class="roman">Abolition Bill</span>. Subsequent debate was lively and extended over two evenings, but when the house divided at 3.30 on the morning of 20 April Wilberforce was defeated by 163 votes to 88. The outbreak both of revolution in France and, early in 1791, of a slave rebellion in the French colony of San Domingo (Haiti) had heightened insecurities and led the majority of MPs to oppose a measure that they perceived as potentially destabilizing.<br>
<br>This set-back demonstrated that victory would not be easy, and so the anti-slavery campaigners sought to broaden their base of support. Wilberforce became more aware than hitherto that activity outside parliament was important. Hence in summer and autumn 1791 he worked with his close friend Henry Thornton to launch the Sierra Leone Company, which aimed to resettle former slaves on the west coast of Africa and to advance legitimate trade with the region. He also began to take a greater direct interest in the work of the committee for the abolition of the slave trade, attending one of its meetings for the first time in December 1791.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1792 Wilberforce again moved in the Commons for abolition. The ensuing all-night debate was one of the memorable occasions of the unreformed parliament, drawing great eloquence from Pitt, Fox, and Wilberforce himself. The decisive intervention came from Henry Dundas, the home secretary, who proposed the compromise of gradual abolition, which passed by 230 votes to 85. Yet it proved a pyrrhic victory, partly because the word &#145;gradual&#146; could be used as a cover for indefinite delay, partly because in the ensuing years further progress was obstructed in the Lords. Wilberforce's troubles were augmented by the threats of John Kimber, a slave-ship captain whom he had named in the Commons as having flogged a slave girl to death. Kimber was consequently arrested and tried for murder, but, having been acquitted because of poorly presented prosecution evidence, he pursued Wilberforce for an apology and compensation, menacing him with physical violence.<br>
<br>Despite such frustration and antagonism, Wilberforce's commitment to abolition never wavered. On 26 February 1793 he narrowly lost a vote in the Commons whereby he had been hoping to put pressure on the Lords. During the sessions of 1793 and 1794 he unsuccessfully promoted a <span class="roman">Foreign Slave Bill</span>, which would have prohibited the use of British ships to carry slaves to the territories of other countries.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, though, other interests developed. Wilberforce believed that insufficient efforts were made to prevent the outbreak of war with France in February 1793, a source of tension in his hitherto close friendship with Pitt. The war continued to concern him greatly, and he was also worried by radical agitation at home, although he did not identify with alarmist reactions. He was, however, the more convinced of the need for national moral and spiritual revival, and in autumn 1793 he began to write material for a &#145;tract&#146; on &#145;practical Christianity&#146; which he saw as a requisite response to the needs of the times. Meanwhile in May 1793 he took the opportunity provided by the renewal of the East India Company's charter to attempt to obtain a legislative commitment to the promulgation of Christianity in India. His clauses were initially included in the bill, but then struck out after lobbying from the directors of the company, who feared that religious confrontations would damage their commercial and political interests.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's disquiet about the war increased, and on 30 December 1794 he moved an amendment to the address urging the government to try to secure peace. On 26 January 1795 he supported an opposition motion with a similar purpose. He thereby further strained his friendship with Pitt, but Wilberforce had no intention of making lasting common cause with the opposition whigs. His position was one of independence on the basis of convictions arrived at through prayer and belief in divine guidance. Pitt did not bear a grudge, and on 26 February supported Wilberforce when he proposed another unsuccessful motion against the slave trade. When Wilberforce again moved for peace on 27 May, Pitt was privately sympathetic, although more hawkish members of the government, notably Dundas and William Windham, remained antagonistic.<br>
<br>By autumn 1795 Wilberforce and Pitt were fully reconciled, on the basis of a desire for peace but also a recognition that it was unrealistic in the short term, coupled with serious concern at growing unrest at home. Hence Wilberforce fully supported Pitt when in November he brought forward the &#145;gagging&#146; bills against seditious meetings and treasonable practices. When Wilberforce received news that Christopher Wyvill was mobilizing Yorkshire against the measures, he made a dramatic dash up the Great North Road in a coach borrowed from Pitt. He arrived in York just in time to deliver a decisive speech at the county meeting on 1 December, when he claimed that the provisions of the bills had been misrepresented, and argued that they offered the best possible balance between &#145;the security of the constitution, and &hellip; every reasonable toleration to the subject&#146;. His intervention was crucial in securing a loyal address rather than a hostile petition.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's support for the government at this crucial juncture served to reduce fears that the anti-slave-trade campaign was potentially subversive. Certainly, when he renewed the parliamentary struggle in February 1796 he met with more success than in recent years, with his <span class="roman">Abolition Bill</span> proceeding as far as a third reading on 15 March. It was then narrowly defeated because some of his supporters were at the opera. The session of 1796 was curtailed by the general election in June, when Wilberforce was again returned for Yorkshire without a contest. On 15 May 1797 he yet again proposed a motion against the slave trade, but once more lost the vote.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's interests in social reform expanded during the mid-1790s. He energetically supported Jeremy Bentham in his abortive plans for a panopticon that would have improved conditions for prisoners. He encouraged medical and educational initiatives and also the Society for Bettering the Condition and Increasing the Comforts of the Poor, formed in 1796. For Wilberforce, though, the nation's most pressing needs were moral and spiritual, and in April 1797 he at last completed and published <span class="italic">A practical view of the prevailing religious system of professed Christians in the higher and middle classes of this country contrasted with real Christianity</span>. This work was the tract begun in 1793 and now expanded into a full-length book. As the title implies, Wilberforce expounded his interpretation of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> teachings as a basis for a critique of the lukewarm and inadequate practice of Christianity he observed around him. He called for religious revival as an essential means of reversing national moral decline. Despite its unfashionable theme and diffuse and discursive style, the book was extensively read and very influential. It was repeatedly reprinted and translated. It was both &#145;the manifesto of the evangelical party of the time&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and Wilberforce's own personal testimony, which provided a powerful rationalization of his philanthropic and political exertions over the preceding decade.<h2>
<a name="Marriagefamilyandreligiouslife"></a>Marriage, family, and religious life</h2>Wilberforce's single-minded commitment to his chosen causes led him during the late 1780s and early 1790s to resist romantic involvements, and there is little doubt that he remained not only single but celibate until his thirty-eighth year. Then on 15 April 1797, while at Bath, he met Barbara Ann (1777&#150;1847), the third child and eldest daughter of Isaac Spooner of Elmdon Hall, Warwickshire, a Birmingham banker, and his wife, Barbara Gough-Calthorpe, the sister of the first Lord Calthorpe. Barbara had come to Wilberforce seeking spiritual advice. He was immediately smitten and, with characteristic impulsiveness, proposed within a fortnight of their first encounter. The couple were married quietly at Walcot church, Bath, on 30 May 1797. The relationship was characterized by enduring mutual devotion, and Barbara's attentiveness helped to sustain Wilberforce's increasingly frail health, although her associated tendency to a narrow-minded possessiveness was also a constraint upon him. Following a near-fatal attack of typhoid in 1800, her own health was never robust. The first child, William, had been born in July 1798, to be followed by Barbara (1799), Elizabeth (1801), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29384/', "Robert Isaac Wilberforce")</script> (1802), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29385/', "Samuel Wilberforce")</script> (1805), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29383/', "Henry William Wilberforce")</script> (1807). Wilberforce loved children and was a devoted and playful father, cultivating a warm family life in the midst of his hectic political activities. Unusually for the period, all the children survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>In 1792 Wilberforce had accepted an invitation from Henry Thornton to share his home at Battersea Rise in Clapham, an accessible refuge from his hectic life at Old Palace Yard. Following his marriage he leased Edward Eliot's nearby house, Broomfield, and after Eliot's death in late 1797 he bought it. Wilberforce, however, retained something of the nomadic spirit of his youth, and continued to travel extensively around the country during the parliamentary recess. His visits to Bath, beneficial to his health and appealing to his innate sociability, were frequent and prolonged.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's Christian commitment remained fundamental to his life. Private prayer and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading were central to his daily routine, and his surviving diaries and journals illustrate the depth of his continual quest for holiness and obedience to the call of God. In the period after his conversion he regularly sought and received counsel from Isaac Milner and John Newton, and as the years passed he himself became a valued spiritual counsellor, notably to the agriculturist Arthur Young, who had been much stirred by reading the <span class="italic">Practical View</span>. Wilberforce cultivated a strongly religious tone in family life through holding daily family prayers and anxiously watching over the spiritual development of his children. When in London he worshipped at the Anglican proprietary Lock Chapel near Hyde Park Corner, whose minister from 1785 was the biblical commentator Thomas Scott; at Clapham he attended the parish church, where John Venn was incumbent. Despite its intensity, Wilberforce's religion was never austere: while reverencing Scott's ministry he did not imbibe his Calvinism, and, while strongly upholding the observance of Sunday as a day of rest, he saw it as a time for recreation with family and friends as well as for spiritual duties.<br>
<br>The 1790s and 1800s marked the heyday of what was later labelled the Clapham Sect, the group of wealthy evangelicals around Wilberforce and Henry Thornton whose other notable members included Edward Eliot, Charles Grant, Zachary Macaulay, John Shore (Lord Teignmouth), and James Stephen. Stephen's second marriage to Wilberforce's sister, Sarah, in 1800 meant that the two close friends became brothers-in-law, and the Wilberforces were linked to another leading religious and literary family. This circle of friends was of great importance to Wilberforce in providing emotional and practical support for the ongoing anti-slave-trade campaign. It was also a focal point for religious initiatives in which he played an important role, notably the formation in 1799 of what became the Church Missionary Society, the launch in 1801 of the magazine <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, and the establishment in 1804 of the British and Foreign Bible Society.<br>
<br>Wilberforce was intensely loyal to the Church of England, seeing it as the essential safeguard of the Christian fabric of the state. Initially, therefore, he opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. One of the key reasons for the success of the <span class="italic">Practical View</span> was that its call for national spiritual and moral renewal could be read in broad Anglican as well as specific evangelical terms. At the same time he had a natural affinity with dissenters and Methodists, and in 1800 his influence was important in deflecting Pitt from a measure to restrict the licensing of preachers.<br>
<br>Even before his conversion Wilberforce had been generous in his charitable giving, but after 1785 he became more energetic and systematic in sharing his considerable wealth with others. For example in 1798, the year after his marriage, he gave away more than &pound;2000. He was willing to assist individuals in straitened circumstances even when he had not been previously acquainted with them. He also gave extensive support to Anglican clergy. In 1789, while staying with Hannah More, he had visited the Mendips, and his appalled reaction to the destitution and lack of education of the local people gave a further focus to his philanthropic aspirations. He undertook to fund More in promoting moral and social improvement in the neighbourhood, and maintained a long-term commitment to supporting her work.<h2>
<a name="Thepathtoabolition17971807"></a>The path to abolition, 1797&#150;1807</h2>The closing years of the eighteenth century were unpropitious for the anti-slave-trade cause. Not only did a sense of national crisis engender a political atmosphere unreceptive to reform and innovation, but the passing in 1797 of a measure that referred the matter to the colonial legislatures further frustrated Wilberforce's efforts. Hence his annual motions in 1798 and 1799 were defeated by narrow majorities. In 1799, however, an act was passed that further restricted overcrowding on slave ships. In 1800 and 1801 Wilberforce refrained from proposing his normal motion, a change of tactics arising initially from hopes for an agreed suspension of the trade and then for an international agreement on abolition as part of a peace settlement. But such expectations proved unfulfilled, and Pitt's resignation in 1801 and replacement as prime minister by the less sympathetic Henry Addington was a further discouragement. In 1802 Wilberforce's readiness to defer to a motion by George Canning against the settlement of slaves in Trinidad meant that his own motion became a mere token gesture at the end of the session.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the moral and social condition of Britain greatly concerned Wilberforce. He supported measures to contain unrest, including the further suspension of habeas corpus, and the <span class="roman">Combination Acts</span> of 1799&#150;1800. His sense of a parallel need for moral reform was evident in his disapproval of Pitt's duel with George Tierney in 1798 and in efforts to promote Sunday observance. When the bad harvests of 1799 and 1800 resulted in much scarcity of food and severe distress among the working class, he assiduously participated in the work of the parliamentary committee charged with finding solutions. His motivation was quite as much compassion as fear of disaffection: his vision was for a stable Christian social order in which the wealthy fully accepted their spiritual, moral, and financial obligations to those less fortunate than themselves.<br>
<br>In the general election of July 1802 Wilberforce was for a fourth time returned unopposed for Yorkshire. The new parliament proved much readier than its predecessor to contemplate abolition of the slave trade, but in the short term any progress was further delayed by the fear of French invasion after the breakdown of the peace of Amiens in 1803. Wilberforce initially opposed the renewal of the war, believing British retention of Malta to be unjustified, but he came to accept that Napoleon's imperialistic ambitions made conflict inevitable.<br>
<br>In the parliamentary session of 1804 the prospects for abolition at last improved. Pitt's return to Downing Street did not help much, but the anti-radical hysteria of the 1790s had receded, and the Irish MPs brought to Westminster by the union of 1801 helped to shift the weight of opinion in the Commons. Hence, on 20 May, Wilberforce obtained leave to bring in a bill by a margin of 124 to 49, and this bill passed through all its stages in the Commons before the end of June. Once again, however, the dawn proved false: it was too late in the session to attempt to get the bill through the Lords that year. Wilberforce had to reintroduce the measure in the Commons in February 1805, only this time to be defeated on the second reading. In the meantime Wilberforce in July 1804 persuaded Pitt to use an order in council to stop the slave trade to Dutch Guiana, which had been captured by Britain. Although the government procrastinated and did not issue the order until September 1805, it did suggest that the trade's days were numbered. A further promising development in 1805 was closer communication between Wilberforce and the whig abolitionists.<br>
<br>Parliamentary resolutions in April 1805 for the impeachment of Lord Melville (Dundas), the first lord of the Admiralty, for condoning the misappropriation of naval funds, presented Wilberforce with a painful tension between his personal loyalty to Pitt and his independent upholding of public morality. Wilberforce, who feared for &#145;the purity of our political system&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 3.228), said that Melville's admission of the truth of the key charge against him gave him no option but to vote for the impeachment resolutions. His speech turned the finely balanced debate against Melville. It also greatly distressed Pitt, but the friendship between him and Wilberforce was unbroken, and the latter, profoundly moved by the prime minister's premature death in January 1806, carried a banner at his public funeral.<br>
<br>Wilberforce supported the Grenville&#150;Fox ministry formed after the death of Pitt. This reflected his general preference for sustaining the government of the day as far as was consistent with his own independence, but he also recognized that, with two longstanding supporters of abolition now in power, the situation was promising. Adopting a tactic suggested by James Stephen, he persuaded the government to reintroduce the unsuccessful <span class="roman">Foreign Slave Bill</span> of the 1790s under the guise of procedural legislation to confirm Pitt's Guiana order in council of the previous year. The measure passed rapidly through both houses, and then, on 10 June 1806, Fox&#151;to whom Wilberforce deferred for the sake of the cause&#151;eloquently moved a resolution for general abolition. It too passed, and Wilberforce moved the subsequent address to the king.<br>
<br>Fox's death in September again destabilized the political situation and was a set-back for abolition. Grenville called a general election with a view to strengthening his position, and after a tense campaign Wilberforce once more carried Yorkshire without a poll. He spent the time before parliament met working on <span class="italic">A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade</span>. Like the <span class="italic">Practical View</span>, his other substantial literary work, this was a pamphlet that grew into a book. It consolidated and restated the formidable array of evidence and argumentation against the trade that Wilberforce had developed over the previous two decades. Its publication on 31 January 1807 served to inform the final phase of the struggle, which had already begun with Grenville's introduction of an <span class="roman">Abolition Bill</span> in the Lords. When it had passed the upper house by unexpectedly large majorities, Viscount Howick (Charles Grey) moved its second reading in the Commons on 23 February. Wilberforce, though, was the real hero of the evening, as it became clear that this phase of his labours was at last coming to a triumphant end. Eloquent tributes were made to his efforts, and the bill passed by 283 votes to 16. It received the royal assent on 25 March.<h2>
<a name="Embodyingthenationalconscience18071825"></a>Embodying the national conscience, 1807&#150;1825</h2>Wilberforce's public standing in the wake of slave-trade abolition was immediately tested severely when the incoming tory government called another general election in May 1807, and for the first and only time in his career he faced a poll for Yorkshire. Confronting as he did the great wealth and influence of both the Fitzwilliam and the Harewood interests, it was a testimony to the personal esteem in which he was held, and to his effectiveness in representing the county over the previous quarter-century, that he was returned at the head of the poll. It was alleged, however, that Wilberforce had compromised his independence by a coalition with Henry Lascelles, the tory candidate. Wilberforce denied the charge and defended himself in a published letter to the electors. He acknowledged that some of his supporters had indeed also solicited votes for Lascelles, but this was without his sanction, and it would have been improper for him to constrain their actions. The experience appears to have confirmed Wilberforce's sense of the need for moderate electoral reform, which he continued to advocate.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's continuing concern over slavery was now carried into creating the African Institution, which aimed to ameliorate conditions in the West Indies, and to develop the Sierra Leone project as a foundation for disseminating Christianity and civilization in Africa. He also sought to prevent slaves being carried in foreign ships. Freed, though, from the immediate pressures of the campaign for British abolition, he was able to exercise his strong moral authority in diverse ways. During these years members of the government readily sought and received his advice, but he maintained his independent stance, even after his friend and fellow evangelical Spencer Perceval became prime minister in 1809. He continued until 1812 assiduously to attend the Commons, with an influential voice on issues such as the duke of York scandal in 1809, the failure of the Walcheren expedition in 1809 and the subsequent parliamentary inquiry, and the regency arrangements consequent on the king's final breakdown in health in 1810&#150;11. His role as leader of the group of evangelical &#145;Saints&#146; in parliament was recognized but informal.<br>
<br>In 1808, anxious to limit his expenses so as better to finance his philanthropy, and weary of continual commuting between Westminster and Clapham, Wilberforce had sold both Broomfield and Old Palace Yard. He purchased a lease of Gore House in Kensington (on the site where the Albert Hall was later built), which provided a relatively rural lifestyle within walking distance of parliament. It also became a centre for his burgeoning extra-parliamentary activities, helping many individuals and acting as an office-bearer and leading supporter for numerous evangelical societies.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1812 Wilberforce, conscious of advancing age and declining energy, decided not to contest Yorkshire, and was returned instead for Bramber in Sussex, a pocket borough controlled by a cousin of his wife, Lord Calthorpe. This change greatly reduced his constituency responsibilities while enabling him to remain in the Commons and to continue to advocate his central concerns. He sat for Bramber for the remainder of his parliamentary career.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's advocacy of religious liberty now came to the fore. He had agonized much on the Roman Catholic question, but now his dislike of perceived prejudice and his belief that concession would strengthen Irish loyalty led him in March 1813 to support emancipation, a stance that put him at odds with many of his evangelical supporters. The renewal of the East India Company's charter then gave him an opportunity to revive his campaign of 1793 to secure the admission of missionaries into India. For him this was a cause analogous to the abolition of the slave trade. He held that it would be the means to liberate India from the &#145;moral and social ignorance and degradation&#146; that he saw as inherent to Hinduism, by opening the way to &#145;Christian light and moral improvement&#146;  (W. Wilberforce, <span class="italic">Substance of the Speeches &hellip; on the East India Bill</span>, 1813, 48, 106). He was supported by extensive petitioning, and on 22 June 1813, in one of his most compelling Commons speeches, he persuaded the house to pass the necessary resolutions. The foundation of the bishopric of Calcutta ensued.<br>
<br>In the meantime Wilberforce maintained the campaign against slavery by promoting a bill, suggested by Stephen, to set up a register of slaves already in the West Indies so as to provide leverage for improving conditions and to make it easy to prevent additions by illicit trading. In 1814, as the war with France appeared at last to be ending, he strongly urged that a general abolition of the slave trade should be incorporated into the peace settlement. He addressed an open letter to Talleyrand on the matter, and also a lengthy personal letter to Alexander I of Russia, who was sympathetic and granted him a private audience when in London in June 1814. Already, however, Wilberforce had been bitterly disappointed by Castlereagh's initial failure to obtain such a provision. He led a campaign, supported by the African Institution and a wave of petitioning, to secure the revision of the treaty. On 27 June he proposed and carried unanimously an address to the regent that committed the government to the cause and ensured that, despite limited short-term success, it remained firmly on the diplomatic agenda, in relation to Spain, Portugal, and the United States, as well as France. A further dimension of Wilberforce's concern to improve conditions in the West Indies came between 1815 and 1820, when he supported and advised Henri Christophe, a former slave who had proclaimed himself king of Haiti, in efforts to promote the educational and religious advance of his people.<br>
<br>In response to the hardship and unrest that followed the end of the Napoleonic wars Wilberforce reluctantly sided with the measures adopted by the Liverpool government. Although his philanthropic and compassionate impulses remained strong, he lacked a first-hand understanding of the extent of the distress of the poor, and regarded radical agitation as subverting the stability of the constitution. He also perceived it as linked to anti-Christian beliefs and believed that &#145;democrats&#146; squeezed out spiritual interest by laying too &#145;great a stress on the concerns of this world&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 5.36). His vote in favour of the corn laws in 1815 led to fears that his house would be attacked. In June 1817 his support for the suspension of habeas corpus caused Sir Francis Burdett ironically to tag him &#145;the honourable and religious member&#146;, provoking Wilberforce into a robust defence of his own stance. In 1819 the Peterloo massacre heightened his fears of subversion, and he approved of the subsequent <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Act</span>. In 1820, when George IV's estranged wife, Caroline of Brunswick, sought her rights as queen, Wilberforce, preoccupied with the dangers to constitutional stability and public morality, tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement. Radical attacks on his perceived hypocrisy indirectly testified to his status as a national moral arbiter.<br>
<br>These years saw failing health and painful bereavements. As he aged, Wilberforce's slight figure became increasingly hunched, and he began to wear a steel corset to support his body. His eyesight, never good, steadily deteriorated, he continued to have bowel problems, and he also suffered recurrent chest complaints. Henry Thornton, whom Hannah More judged &#145;a great part of himself&#146;  (Pollock, 248), died in 1815, Wilberforce's sister, Sarah, in 1816, and his elder daughter, Barbara, in 1821. Meanwhile in 1819 his eldest son, William, now grown into an amiable but feckless young man, distressed his father by his manner of life as a Cambridge undergraduate.<br>
<br>Amid these public and private burdens Wilberforce, fortified by his Christian convictions, retained an underlying emotional equanimity and a brightness and warmth of manner that impressed his acquaintances. Radicals might dislike him, but he was enormously venerated by the evangelicals, and the appearance of his increasingly frail and bent figure at religious meetings was greeted with great adulation.<br>
<br>By the early 1820s Wilberforce was limiting his public activities. In 1821 his decision to sell Gore House and move to Marden Park in Surrey, 15 miles from Westminster, signified a growing disengagement from parliamentary affairs. Conscious, however, that his active career was nearing its close, he still sought to give renewed impetus to the campaign against slavery. Hopes that the end of the slave trade would lead to an amelioration of conditions in the West Indies had been disappointed, and the proposal for a register of slaves failed to make progress. Emancipation appeared to be the only effectual way forward. In May 1821 Wilberforce approached Thomas Fowell Buxton to be his coadjutor and eventual successor in the Commons leadership of the campaign to free the slaves. Little was done until early in 1823, when the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96359', "Anti-Slavery Society")</script> was formed, and Wilberforce published his <span class="italic">Appeal to the religion, justice and humanity of the inhabitants of the British empire in behalf of the negro slaves in the West Indies</span>. In this pamphlet he dwelt on the moral and spiritual degradation of the slaves and presented their emancipation as a matter of national duty to God. It proved to be a powerful inspiration for the anti-slavery agitation in the country. It also stirred William Cobbett into a virulent published attack on Wilberforce for his alleged failure to acknowledge the extent of the deprivation and oppression suffered by the &#145;free British labourers&#146; whose lot he had contrasted favourably with that of the slaves.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's anxiety to participate in the parliamentary campaign was indicated by a move back to London, to Grove House in Brompton, but it was now Buxton who took the lead in the Commons, by moving a resolution against slavery on 15 May 1823. Wilberforce spoke in his support and also participated in anti-slavery debates on 16 March and 11 June 1824, when in his last speech in the Commons he urged that the matter should not be left to the colonial governments. While it was clear that he no longer had strength for protracted and extensive activity, he had provided an invaluable initial impetus to this new phase in the anti-slavery movement.<h2>
<a name="Retirementdeathandreputation18251833"></a>Retirement, death, and reputation, 1825&#150;1833</h2>Wilberforce suffered two bouts of serious illness in 1824, and early in 1825 he bowed to the inevitable and resigned his parliamentary seat. He purchased Highwood Hill, a house with a small estate at Mill Hill in Middlesex, in a rural situation but accessible to London, and moved there in 1826. Free from the stress of public life, his health improved somewhat, and he passed an active retirement, rejoicing in the beauties of nature, maintaining his extensive correspondence, continuing to travel extensively on visits to numerous friends, and cultivating his devotional life. Although generally withdrawing from politics, he retained his passionate commitment to the anti-slavery cause, offering counsel and occasional public support to its active leaders.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's family was a source of both pride and pain. He delighted in the academic success of his three younger sons and in their decisions to take Anglican orders. Although Robert and Henry later converted to Roman Catholicism, during their father's lifetime the evangelicalism of the family appeared secure. Meanwhile, Wilberforce supported William in a speculative dairy business, the failure of which in 1830 caused him disastrous financial losses. The death of the younger daughter, Elizabeth, in 1832, brought further grief to her parents.<br>
<br>The severe financial retrenchment forced upon Wilberforce in 1830 led him to let Highwood and to spend his closing years in a peripatetic existence, focused on the vicarages of two of his sons. He divided the bulk of his time between Brighstone on the Isle of Wight, where Samuel, later bishop of Oxford and Winchester, was incumbent, and East Farleigh in Kent, to which Robert had recently been presented by Lord Chancellor Brougham out of concern for Wilberforce's financial situation.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's final decline in health began early in 1833 with a severe attack of influenza. He went to Bath, where the waters had so often in the past appeared beneficial to him, but this time he experienced no relief, suffering &#145;much from pain and languor&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 5.355). In mid-July he was moved to London, where for some days he seemed to improve. Late on 26 July he was thrilled to hear that the bill for the abolition of slavery had passed its third reading in the Commons, the culmination of his life's work. On the following evening he became much weaker, and after a series of fainting fits he died, early in the morning of 29 July at 44 Cadogan Place, Sloane Street.<br>
<br>Wilberforce had wished to be buried at Stoke Newington with his sister and elder daughter, but following a requisition&#151;at the instigation of Lord Brougham, from many peers and MPs&#151;the family consented to interment in Westminster Abbey. The funeral took place there on 3 August, with the lord chancellor, the speaker of the House of Commons, and the duke of Gloucester among the pallbearers. The distinguished and numerous attendance from both houses of parliament and the extensive interest of the general public were &#145;exalted testimony of the esteem in which he was held &hellip; and of the friendship which his mild manners and noble qualities had won him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). He was laid to rest on the same day in the north transept, close to three other great parliamentarians of his generation: Pitt, Fox, and Canning. A striking seated statue by Samuel Joseph was erected in Westminster Abbey in 1840, and a commemorative column was erected in Hull in 1834.<br>
<br>The five-volume life of Wilberforce by his sons Robert and Samuel was published in 1838. It was copiously documented, but thin on interpretation; strong on insight into its subject's religious life, weak on understanding of the context of his political achievements. It gave rise to an unedifying controversy with the veteran Thomas Clarkson, who felt that his own role in the abolition campaign had been denigrated. Two prominent tendencies in subsequent perceptions of Wilberforce had already been presaged during his lifetime. To evangelicals he was a seminal leader and inspiration, a man of committed faith and integrity, who at great personal cost followed the call of Christ to help the oppressed abroad and proclaim the moral and spiritual imperatives of the gospel at home. In the eyes of secular radicals and socialists, however, his concentration on overseas slavery, his spiritual and moral preoccupations, and his underlying social conservatism caused him to disregard the deprivation and injustice suffered by his own countrymen. Behind both perceptions, though, lay an awareness of his undoubted stature as a leader who stirred the conscience of the nation and upheld the human rights and dignity of the slaves. Many others contributed to the campaign against slavery, but Wilberforce's role was essential and unique precisely because he was a fully integrated and respected member of the political and social &eacute;lite. While he challenged the attitudes of his class, he did not transcend them, but by his residual conformity he secured his enduring influence. In religion the legacy of his evangelistic zeal and spiritual earnestness helped to shape the Victorian age he did not live to see; in politics he maintained a courage, independence, and incorruptibility that has given lasting inspiration to British public life.<br>
