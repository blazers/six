<span class="headword">Holles, Sir  William</span>  (1471?&#150;1542), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was one of three sons of Thomas Holles, yeoman, of Stoke. He was born at Stoke in Warwickshire, on the outskirts of Coventry. One brother, Thomas, became a priest. Holles was apprenticed to Robert Kervile, citizen and mercer of London, on 13 July 1493. He was admitted to the freedom of the Mercers' Company on 17 September 1499, entered the livery in 1507, was warden in 1518&#150;19, and became master of the company in 1529. He married, before 1509, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1544), daughter of John (or Thomas) Scopeham of London, and had sons John (who died young, possibly at the Guild of the Holy Trinity, Coventry), Thomas, William, and Francis, and daughters Anne and Joan. Holles was elected sheriff of London by the commonality in September 1527, and alderman for Aldgate ward on 31 March 1528; in August 1534 he transferred to Broad Street ward. A merchant of the staple and a supplier of fine imported cloth to Henry VIII, he attended the baptism of Princess Elizabeth on 10 September 1533 and was knighted the following month.<br>
<br>Considered to be London's most religiously conservative alderman, Holles was prevented from being selected as lord mayor in 1536, and the protestant Ralph Warren was elected instead. This led the city to petition the king to permit its accustomed free election, but royal intrusion again prevented Holles's selection in 1537 and 1538. He was allowed to assume the mayoralty on 13 October 1539. During his year in office Holles caused the moor ditch to be cleaned, and received Anne of Cleves in great state on 3 January 1540, but he was best known for the steadfast persecution of protestant heresy within the city. In July of 1540 as many as 500 Londoners were arrested and interrogated under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> (1539). This proved to be so divisive that restraints on the city's enthusiasm were imposed by the state.<br>
<br>Holles was also known for his sharp business practices. In 1536 he alienated Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle, when he conspired to transfer a long-disputed Somerset estate to Sir Edward Seymour by offering Lisle a short-term loan and then foreclosing on the estate. In a similar manner, Holles acquired property in Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire for the inheritance of his younger son William by foreclosing in 1537 on his loan to Sir Ralph Langford. He purchased manors from, among others, William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton, Thomas Manners, earl of Rutland, and Sir Thomas Elliot, leased crown property, and speculated in the lands of the dissolved religious houses, as he built up landed estates for each of his three adult sons. On his deathbed he observed that he had:<blockquote>hughly and singulerly preferred and set forthe my three sones in my lyfe tyme and have given and assured unto every of theym Manors landes tenements and heredytamentes And whiche of them that hath least cost me foure Thousande markes [&pound;2666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.] and above. (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/29, sig. 110)</blockquote>The eldest son, Sir Thomas of Newstead, Lincolnshire, and Flitcham, Norfolk, married Catherine Payne, a maid of honour to Katherine of Aragon. The second, Sir William (<i>d</i>. 1591), established a notable family seat at Haughton, Nottinghamshire, on property purchased for him from John Babington, married in 1535 Anne, daughter and coheir of John Denzel, and served as sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire under Mary I and Elizabeth I; his grandson and heir, John Holles (1564&#150;1637), was created earl of Clare in 1624. The youngest son, Francis, of Hainton, Lincolnshire, esquire, married Katherine, daughter of John Heneage of Hainton, but died in 1543 without heirs. Anne, who predeceased her father, married Sir John Whiddon, serjeant-at-law and later judge of queen's bench. The extent of Holles's wealth is suggested by his assessment for the royal subsidy of 1541; at &pound;4000, the mercer was rated second in the entire city.<br>
<br>Holles died in London, in the parish of St Helen, Bishopsgate, on 20 October 1542; his remains were interred in St Helen's. By his will, dated 25 December 1541 and proved on 18 December 1542, he requested requiem masses for twenty years at the churches of St Thomas Becket and St Helen, Bishopsgate, and in the mystery of the Mercers' Company. He completed payment of &pound;200 to the city of Coventry for the erection of a 57-foot-high city cross at Cross Chipping, which stood until 1771. His son and heir, Thomas, was granted livery of his lands on 26 April 1543. Through improvidence he was said to have wasted an inheritance estimated to be worth &pound;10,000 per annum and, according to family tradition, died in prison. Dame Elizabeth Holles died on 13 March 1544. By her will of 17 February 1544 she endowed almshouses for six aged men or women beside the church of St Helen, Bishopsgate (later called Sir Andrew Judd's Almshouses), and bestowed the residue of her estate upon deeds of charity at the discretion of her executors, Andrew Judd and Thomas Scopeham.<br>
