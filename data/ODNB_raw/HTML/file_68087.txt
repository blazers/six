<span class="headword">Blage, Sir  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1512&#150;1551), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the younger son of Sir Robert Blage of Broke Montagu, Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1522), and of Mary, the daughter of John Brooke, seventh Baron Cobham. He is said to have been educated at Cambridge. By 1535 he was in diplomatic service, working in France under Bishop Stephen Gardiner. He was already friendly with Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder, his cousin by marriage. During 1538&#150;9 he again served on a diplomatic mission, working for Wyatt himself in Spain. He was back in London by July 1540, when he was licensed to export bell-metal with a group of other courtiers. It is likely that about this time he secured an appointment in the king's privy chamber. He fought in the French campaigns of 1543&#150;5, and was nicknamed Tom Trubbe by the soldiers for reasons that are not now clear. He began to collect other dignities: he was made chief steward and bailiff of Maidstone in 1544 and comptroller of the petty custom of London in 1546. He sat in parliament in 1545 and in 1547, for Bedford and Westminster respectively. During the Scottish campaign of September 1547 he was knighted by Protector Somerset. In 1548 Sir Thomas Seymour tried to recruit Blage as an ally against his brother the protector, but Blage refused and in due course testified against Seymour. Favours continued: he and his associate Richard Goodricke (who later married his widow) received a grant of former chantry lands in Dartford and Maidstone in 1550. Later the same year Blage testified against his old master Gardiner. He died at Stanmore, Middlesex, on 17 June 1551, perhaps a victim of the sweating sickness. He was survived by a widow, Dorothy, daughter of William Badby of Essex, and four children: Henry, Hester, Judith, and Jane.<br>
<br>It was Blage's relationship with Wyatt and his circle, and what followed from it, that distinguished him from the ordinary run of courtiers. Blage shared his friend's love for poetry, and surpassed him in zeal for the protestant cause. During Wyatt's imprisonment in 1541 he cited Blage as one who would vouch for him; Leland later wrote that Wyatt &#145;took delight in Blage's subtle mind&#146;  (Muir, <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 264). Blage received the stewardship of Maidstone in succession to Wyatt after the latter's death in 1542. Blage also, it seems, inherited Wyatt's antipathy to Thomas Wriothesley, earl of Southampton. He wrote a vicious epitaph crowing over the former lord chancellor's death in 1549: &#145;The dog is dead; his soul is down to hell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Howard</span>, 1.xcvii). Most of Blage's own poetry was indifferent, but he did preserve a good deal of Wyatt's verse alongside his own in what became an important manuscript (now in Trinity College, Dublin).<br>
<br>Blage had a more troubled relationship with Wyatt's literary successor, Henry Howard, earl of Surrey. When Surrey led a group of young bloods on a rampage through London in January 1543, Blage rebuked him for his folly; Surrey's whole circle was tainted by this incident, and it may have cost Blage a promotion. They remained friends, however, and he accompanied Surrey to the siege of Landrecy later that year, where Blage &#145;escaped very hardly from a piece of ordnance that was shot towards him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Henry Howard</span>, 1, appx, xxxix). By 1545 the two men had fallen out more seriously. It was rumoured that Surrey was plotting to usurp the throne after Henry VIII's death, and the religious conservatism of his father, the duke of Norfolk, was well known. Blage did not wish the Howards to have any role in a prospective regency government. He claimed afterwards that he would rather have killed Surrey with his own hands than see this happen, and he may have testified against Surrey at his treason trial in January 1547. Surrey was executed, but not before making peace with his friend. Writing from prison, he reaffirmed his evangelical faith, and added: &#145;now, my Blage, mine error well I see&#146;  (ibid., 1.80).<br>
<br>Those evangelical convictions were held much more strongly by Blage himself. In 1542 he had become involved in an attempt to free the protestant agitator John Porter from prison. In 1546 he walked to the stake with the convicted sacramentaries Anne Askew and John Lassells. He had nearly burned with them. In May 1546 he had allegedly denounced the mass in the hearing of two of his fellow MPs. He was accused of posing the familiar heretic's trick question of the validity of the consecrated host which is eaten by a mouse, and of adding &#145;that in his opinion it were well done that the mouse were taken and put in the pix&#146;, that is, held up for adoration  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 21/1, no. 1383 [72]). He was arrested in July, and despite his denials and attempts at legal manoeuvres, was condemned to death. Awaiting execution, he too wrote a poem, resigning his soul to God and meditating on how, despite his obedience to the law, the clergy had sought his blood. It now seemed to him that his effort &#145;to plees bothe god and kynge&#146; had been vain  (Muir, <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 273).<br>
<br>However, Blage spoke too soon. Henry VIII personally intervened to pardon him. He was too fond of the man to see him burn. According to John Foxe's account, when the king saw Blage soon afterwards:<blockquote>Ah my pig sayth the king to him, (for so he was wont to call him.) Yea sayd he, if your maiestie had not bene better to me then your Bishops were, your pig had bene rosted ere this time. (Foxe, <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>, 1583, 1246)</blockquote>The &#145;king's pig&#146; lived to see the beliefs for which he had been condemned become established orthodoxy. After his death Thomas Lever mourned him as &#145;gentle Blage&#146;, a &#145;singular ornament&#146; whose &#145;courtship&#146; was a loss to England  (Strype, 89).<br>
