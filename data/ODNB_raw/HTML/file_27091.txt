<span class="headword">Taylor,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1423), <span class="occ">Lollard heretic</span>, was born in Worcestershire, to unknown parents, and studied at Oxford. He was a master of arts by 1405&#150;6, when he is recorded as principal of St Edmund Hall. He and his successor, Peter Payne, were probably responsible for making the hall a centre of Wycliffite teaching at Oxford. Taylor incurred official hostility when he preached a sermon at Paul's Cross in 1406, criticizing clerical rights of dominion, and supporting the power of the laity to withdraw ecclesiastical temporalities. The surviving text of this shows that he was a man of considerable learning. After failing to respond to a citation by Archbishop Thomas Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1414) he was excommunicated for contumacy, the citation being renewed without success in 1410. At some unidentified date during this period he was replaced as principal of the hall, and probably left Oxford.<br>
<br>Taylor presumably did not participate in Sir John Oldcastle's rebellion of 1414, for he is next noted as an offender in 1417, when twelve jurors in a secular court presented him for preaching against the honouring of images and speaking against the anti-Lollard statute of the Leicester parliament in 1414. He may initially have faced investigations before the bishop of Worcester, but in February 1420 was tried before Archbishop Henry Chichele (<i>d</i>. 1443) and admitted that he had remained excommunicated for fourteen years after Arundel's sentence. He submitted, was absolved, and granted letters of purgation, but later in the year was arrested for heretical preaching, along with Thomas Drayton, a Lollard priest who had been prominent in the rising of 1414, but had been pardoned and received a benefice in Bristol. Drayton was tried in the Worcester episcopal court, but Taylor's case was reserved to convocation in the following May, when he was found guilty of teaching heresy and was condemned to life imprisonment. He was again pardoned, and gave pledges in chancery not to preach heresy in future. He relapsed, however, and in February 1423 was charged with communicating heretical ideas to another Bristol priest, Thomas Smith. The principal charges concerned veneration of images, but in none of the proceedings was he ever accused of denying transubstantiation. (Significantly in his sermon of 1406 he seems deliberately to have avoided this issue.) As this had been Wyclif's most radical heresy, Taylor probably did not share his master's views. Two men later accused of heresy who admitted association with him, John Walcote in 1425 and William Emayn in 1429, were also not accused of this belief. As in 1406 he was critical of priests exercising temporal dominion and was hostile to the mendicancy of the friars, declaring that his views were approved by Christ's law, despite their condemnation by the Council of Constance. After being found guilty he refused to recant, and was sentenced to death as a relapsed heretic. He was degraded from his orders, handed over to the secular arm, and burnt at Smithfield on 2 March 1423.<br>
