<span class="headword">Torry,  Patrick</span>  (1763&#150;1852), <span class="occ">Scottish Episcopal bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld, and Dunblane</span>, born on 27 December 1763 in the parish of St Edward, Aberdeenshire, was the son of Thomas Torry, a woollen cloth manufacturer at Garneston, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson, daughter of a farmer in the same parish. He was raised as a member of the Church of Scotland, but his uncle James Watson, who had joined the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, influenced him in the direction of Episcopalianism. After schooling at Lonmay, Aberdeenshire, Torry began teaching at the age of eighteen, first in Selkirk parish school under his uncle, and then at Lonmay. In June 1782 he went to live with John Skinner of Linshart (1721&#150;1807), under whose tutoring he read for Episcopalian orders, and in the following September he was ordained deacon of the Scottish Episcopal church by Bishop Robert Kilgour of Aberdeen. Though only nineteen years old, Torry was put in charge of a congregation at Arradoul, Banffshire, and in 1783 he was ordained priest. In 1787 he married Kilgour's daughter, Christian, who died childless in 1789. In the same year Torry became Kilgour's assistant in his charge at Peterhead, and on Kilgour's death in 1791 Torry succeeded to his charge, which he held until 1837. He married his second wife, Jane, daughter of Dr William Young of Fawsyde, Kincardineshire, in September 1791; they had three sons and four daughters, of whom the eldest son, John, became dean of St Andrews. In 1807 Torry was made treasurer of the Scottish Episcopal Friendly Society.<br>
<br>On 6 October 1808 Torry was elected bishop of Dunkeld in succession to Jonathan Watson, and was consecrated bishop on 12 October at Aberdeen. As bishop he retained his pastoral charge at Peterhead, where he lived. George Gleig was originally chosen bishop, but the hostility of Bishop John Skinner (1744&#150;1816) kept Gleig out of the see. Torry retained his bishopric for forty-four years; towards the end of his life he was one of the last survivors of the penal years of Scottish Episcopalianism and the nonjuring tradition of the eighteenth century. In 1837 he resigned his charge of the congregation at Peterhead, though he continued to reside there. Torry's age prevented his being elected in 1841 as primus in succession to Bishop James Walker. Following the revival of the medieval episcopal title of St Andrews at a synod held at Edinburgh in September 1844, Torry was henceforth known as bishop of the united dioceses of St Andrews, Dunkeld, and Dunblane.<br>
<br>The most important incident of Torry's episcopate was the publication in April 1850 of his <span class="italic">Prayer-Book</span>, which claimed to be the embodiment of the usages of the Scottish Episcopal church. Torry had throughout his life been a staunch champion of the Scottish communion office, which was derived, through Laud's prayer book of 1637, from the first prayer book of Edward VI. The office was used by those Episcopalians in communion with the Scottish bishops who remained illegal nonjurors until the death of Prince Charles in 1788, when they took the oath to George III and were subsequently joined by the juring Episcopalian congregations in Scotland. The latter, while becoming members of the Scottish Episcopal church, retained the use of the English prayer book and looked to conformity with the Church of England. In 1847 a petition was presented to Torry from some of his clergy requesting that he patronize the compilation of a service book comprising the nonjuring liturgical usages. Torry's <span class="italic">Prayer-Book</span>, as it was known, was recommended by him and published in April 1850 as though it were the authorized service book of the Scottish Episcopal church. A storm of opposition led by Charles Wordsworth at once arose because of the minority use of the Scottish communion office among Episcopalians, the threat to Episcopalian similarity with the Church of England, and the lack of canonical sanction for some of its usages. During a struggle between the formerly nonjuring and Anglicized traditions of the Scottish Episcopal church, the publication was censured by a majority of the Scottish Episcopal synod, by the St Andrews diocesan synod on 19 June 1850, and again, after Torry had published a protest, by the Episcopal synod on 5 September.<br>
<br>Other questions on which Torry came into conflict with his fellow bishops were the support he gave to the European mission to Anglicans of Bishop Michael Luscombe and his favourable reception of the appeal of William Palmer (1811&#150;1879) in connection with Palmer's exploration of the intercommunion of Anglicanism and Eastern orthodoxy. Torry was regarded by English Tractarians as the most sympathetic figure among the Scottish bishops, apart from Bishop Alexander Forbes of Brechin. They therefore sponsored a number of initiatives in his diocese, including the foundation of Trinity College, Glenalmond, and the building of St Ninian's Cathedral, Perth, an early outpost of Anglo-Catholic ritualism in Scotland, the statutes of which Torry formally approved on 6 January 1851. Torry died at Peterhead on 3 October 1852, and was buried in St Ninian's Cathedral on 13 October.<br>
