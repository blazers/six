<span class="headword">Marre, Sir  Alan Samuel</span>  (1914&#150;1990), <span class="occ">civil servant and ombudsman</span>, was born on 25 February 1914 in Bow, London, the fourth child and second son in the family of three sons and three daughters of Joseph Moshinsky, who ran a tobacconist's shop near Aldgate East Station, and his wife, Rebecca. His parents were Russian Jews who had settled in England in 1907. Marre (who, in 1941, like his elder brother, changed his name by deed poll) won a scholarship to St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School, Southwark, and an open scholarship to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. There he won the John Stewart of Rannoch scholarship and secured first-class honours in both parts of the classical tripos (1934 and 1935).<br>
<br>Marre entered the Ministry of Health in 1936, as an assistant principal. Though in a reserved occupation, he tried to volunteer for the Royal Air Force when the Second World War began, but he was rejected because of his very short sight. He worked in a variety of departmental posts, and helped to launch the National Health Service. He became a principal in 1941, assistant secretary in 1946, and under-secretary in 1952. Eleven years later he moved to the Ministry of Labour, where he handled policy on industrial relations. He returned to the Ministry of Health as deputy secretary in 1964, spent a further two years in the Department of Employment and Productivity, then went back to his home department in 1968 as second permanent under-secretary. This was a time of adjustment to the creation of the composite Department of Health and Social Security, of which Richard Crossman was the first secretary of state. Crossman's personality was not well adapted to the role of departmental minister, and he was notoriously difficult to work with. It was not an easy or comfortable period for Marre; but he managed to establish and maintain a satisfactory relationship with Crossman, who in his diary referred to him as &#145;a charming sweet man&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1971 Marre became parliamentary commissioner for administration (parliamentary ombudsman), the second holder of the post. In 1973 he additionally became the first health service commissioner, carrying both responsibilities until his retirement in 1976. He was subsequently requested by the government to carry out two difficult and sensitive inquiries, one into the position of those children disabled because of the drug thalidomide who had not benefited from an earlier overall settlement, the other into a &pound;130 million discrepancy in the report on teachers' pay by the standing commission on pay comparability, chaired by Hugh Clegg  (seventh report, 1980). From 1979 to 1985 he was vice-chairman of the advisory committee on distinction awards for NHS consultants, and from 1983 to 1987 chairman of the newly established committee on rural dispensing, when he did much to defuse a bitter and long-standing dispute between the medical and pharmaceutical professions. He also devoted time and energy to a range of voluntary organizations, being chairman of Age Concern England in 1977&#150;80. He was appointed CB in 1955 and KCB in 1970.<br>
<br>Marre, with his horn-rimmed spectacles and bald dome, was friendly and approachable, though cool and restrained. His gifts were not so much originality and imagination as excellent judgement and analytical ability, and he was also a good negotiator. His specific strengths included precision in thought and expression, thoroughness, respect for the facts, detachment, and a sense of justice. In his official work he maintained a scrupulous political neutrality, and the tradition of civil service anonymity was thoroughly congenial to him. There were some (including Crossman) who criticized his appointment as ombudsman, doubting whether, despite the strengths which had served him so well as a departmental civil servant, he had the public relations skills and the radically questioning, even aggressive, attitudes which the post required. In fact, he managed to come to terms with the public aspects of his task and, though unabrasive and disinclined to attack the general ethos of contemporary government, proved himself just, persistent, and firmly independent. He gained public credit for his handling of some of the difficult cases which came his way. His career is of particular interest because in its later years it reflects the transition from a civil service imbued with the traditions of neutrality and anonymity, begun in 1853 as a result of the Northcote-Trevelyan report, to one where senior officials appear in the public arena and are held personally accountable. For Marre, this change was against his personal grain, but he had the adaptability to adjust to it successfully.<br>
<br>Marre had a happy domestic life. On 24 December 1943 he married Mary Gilling [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97610/', "Marre, (Romola) Mary (1920&#150;2005)")</script>], daughter of Aubrey John Gilling, bank manager. She herself had a distinguished career of public service, particularly on the London Voluntary Service Council, being appointed CBE in 1979. They had one son and one daughter. Marre died of cancer on 20 March 1990, at his home, 44 The Vale, Golders Green, London.<br>
