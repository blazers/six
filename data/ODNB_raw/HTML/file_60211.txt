<span class="headword">Low,  (Helen) Nora Wilson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Lorna Moon]</span>  (1886&#150;1930), <span class="occ">novelist and screenwriter</span>, was born on 16 June 1886 in North Street, in the village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire, the second of the four daughters and a son of Charles Low (1860/61&#150;1952) and Margaret Benzies (1863&#150;1945). Charles was registered at birth as the illegitimate son of Mary-Ann Low and Charles May, the butler of a family for whom Mary-Ann had worked in Deeside. Family rumour, however, speculated that his father may have been a more aristocratic member of the household. Brought up by his grandmother, Charles Low followed his grandfather into the family trade of stone-dressing and plastering. While Nora (as she wanted to be known) was growing up, her father worked abroad. After returning to Strichen he became landlord of the Temperance Hotel. An atheist and socialist who enjoyed discussing politics, her father was a powerful figure, who has been described as widely experienced, extremely intelligent, and well read. Local anecdote also paints him as rejecting the success of his daughter, who dedicated her first book, <span class="italic">Doorways in Drumorty</span>, to him: &#145;To My Dad This, His Wee Nottie's First Book.&#146; His granddaughter Evelyn and eldest daughter, Annie, are both quoted as disputing this account and claim that he was proud of her writing  (de Mille, 124). Margaret Benzies, her mother, suffered considerable hardship bringing up the family. Anecdotal evidence also describes her character: &#145;She wis a woman like this; she'd a likit to be upper class&#146;  (William Center, quoted in <span class="italic">Leopard Magazine</span>, February 1981). Nora Low grew up in the small community she depicts with such detail in her fiction. She received an elementary education at the local Episcopal school, but according to various sources had a passion for reading and attended evening classes in an attempt to further her education. The few surviving photographs show that Nora possessed a dark red-haired and intense beauty. In 1907 a commercial traveller staying at the Temperance Hotel, 29-year-old William Hebditch (1878&#150;1960) from Yorkshire, fell in love with Nora and they secretly arranged to be married on Christmas eve of that year in Aberdeen. They left for Selby in Yorkshire, where Nora had a child, Bill, but soon emigrated to Entwistle in Alberta, Canada.<br>
<br>Information on the intervening years was for some time sketchy and contradictory. Research by her son has, however, established that Nora left Hebditch in 1913 for another Yorkshireman, Walter Moon (1890&#150;1971), moving first to Winnipeg then Minneapolis in 1917, where she worked as a journalist. She also bore Moon a child, Mary, in 1914, but the child was sent back to Moon's family in England. Accounts of her transition to Hollywood are again contradictory; her son concedes there is a problem in that she &#145;told so many false stories&#146; and liked to create a mythical background for herself  (de Mille, 259). She appears, however, to have left Walter Moon and found herself employment, working for Cecil B. DeMille on <span class="italic">The Affairs of Anatol</span> (1921). Hollywood at the time was keen to attract new and marketable writers into the developing field of screenwriting, and Lorna Moon, as she was now known, achieved success very quickly. She also appears to have became the mistress of William de Mille (1878&#150;1955) and to have borne another son, Richard de Mille, the &#145;foundling&#146; child who was adopted by William's brother, Cecil, in 1922. While pregnant she was also diagnosed as having tuberculosis, and spent a considerable amount of time in a sanatorium, while working on her fiction.<br>
<br>In Hollywood, Nora worked on a number of screenplays. Her greatest success was <span class="italic">Mr. Wu</span> (1927), produced by MGM and starring Lon Chaney, but she also worked in screenwriting teams on a variety of silent films, including the romantic comedy <span class="italic">Don't Tell Everything</span> (1921) starring Gloria Swanson, and <span class="italic">Her Husband's Trademark</span> (1922), again with Gloria Swanson, the latter directed by Cecil B. DeMille, <span class="italic">Love</span> (1927), a version of <span class="italic">Anna Karenina</span> with Greta Garbo, <span class="italic">After Midnight</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">Women Love Diamonds</span> (1927). She was also involved with the storylines of <span class="italic">Too much Wife</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Upstage</span> (1926). The last film with which she is accredited, a comedy, <span class="italic">Min and Bill</span>, brought out in 1930, appears to have been a much changed, Americanized, version of her novel, <span class="italic">Dark Star</span>, which she had sold to MGM at the suggestion of her friend and fellow screenwriter, Frances Marion, as a means of raising funds. Marion, one of the best-known of Hollywood screenwriters, describes how, &#145;all of us loved this girl, who had blithesome flights of fancy and a rare sense of humour&#146;  (Marion, 204). In her obituary the <span class="italic">Los Angeles Times</span> acknowledged Moon as one of the three best scenario writers in Hollywood. While the exotic quality of her Hollywood career may appear surprising given her origins in rural Aberdeenshire, her fiction demonstrates the writing talent which won her acclaim.<br>
<br>Both the collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Doorways in Drumorty</span> (published in America in 1925, in Britain in 1926), and Nora's novel, <span class="italic">Dark Star</span> (1929), draw on her experiences of growing up in a small and inward-looking community, presenting this world with a vividness and harshness which distinguishes her writing from other fiction of the Scottish kailyard school, and aligns it more closely with the work of Lewis Grassic Gibbon (Leslie Mitchell), another novelist from north-east Scotland. Drawing upon local characters and tales for her inspiration, she also parallels Gibbon in having offended the local community. Various accounts suggest that her father was particularly upset by a story &#145;The Funeral&#146;, in <span class="italic">Doorways in Drumorty</span>, which depicts the pride and suffering of a mother whose child is dying, and whose husband, working abroad, leaves her in poverty. Some commentators suggest this story, which does seem to draw upon her own memories of her father working away, shows the guilty man as living &#145;in elegance&#146; while his wife suffers. The story, however, suggests he is unable to get work, and that the community is at fault for creating a code of pride whereby the mother cannot confess her poverty. It is therefore more focused on the tensions experienced by the woman, and less directly critical of the father, than some readings suggest. All the stories in <span class="italic">Doorways in Drumorty</span> explore similar themes: the particular codes and conventions created by such a closed community, patterns of surveillance, strictures of public morality, evidence of private despair. They engage with the margins of this world, presenting itinerants, outcasts, and misfits with a distinct lack of sentimentality. Low's work is also striking in its awareness of the position of women in the community: her stories deal with minutiae, with networks of power which operate in apparently insignificant areas.<br>
<br>Nora's novel, <span class="italic">Dark Star</span>, which was well received in both America and Britain, presents a similarly uncompromising picture of rural life, and again has a local setting, drawing on Strichen, but also nearby fishing villages such as Broadsea, Pennan, or Gardenstown. The plot may, in fact, have been based on stories Nora Low heard as a child when visiting relatives in Broadsea. The novel dissects, with an odd mixture of realism and melodrama, the plight of Nancy, illegitimate and an outsider in her narrow world. While delineating her attempts to escape its confines through romance, the text explores the precarious social structures, the sexual instabilities, and the surface hypocrisies which define it. This book too appears to have been unpopular in Strichen and was, according to some reports, banned from the local library because its depiction of a legless librarian was rather too close to the actuality.<br>
<br>Nora's books (published under the name Lorna Moon) remained unknown to the mainstream of Scottish literature for a considerable time although, through the advocacy of David Toulmin, both were republished in 1980 and 1981 by Gourdas House publishers. After that her work was given growing attention, in particular through feminist interest in its depiction of women's lives, although her name is still not widely known, even in Scotland. Nora was ill with tuberculosis in the last few years of her life and, the subject of much media interest in America, died from a fatal haemorrhage in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 1 May 1930. On 3 June that year her ashes were brought home by a young American man she had met in a sanatorium, Everett Marcy (1902&#150;1948?), and, according to her wishes, were scattered &#145;to the four winds&#146; on Mormond Hill, behind Strichen.<br>
