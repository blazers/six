<span class="headword">Caryll,  John</span>  (1460s&#150;1523), <span class="occ">law reporter</span>, was born into an obscure Sussex family in the 1460s. As a young man, he occasionally spelt his name Caarle, which may import a peasant origin. By March 1485 he was studying law in the Inner Temple, and it is likely that he entered the inn as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of John Baker, a bencher of the inn who also came from Sussex. He was a justice of the peace for Sussex from 18 February 1496 until his death. In 1493 he obtained the third prothonotaryship of the court of common pleas in succession to Humphrey Coningsby under an agreement that he would pass the office on in due course to Coningsby's son. Caryll held the office until he became a serjeant-at-law in 1510, when it passed to William Coningsby. During this period as a prothonotary, Caryll also practised privately, both as attorney and counsel, and from 1495 he was clerk of assize on the western circuit.<br>
<br>Caryll served as treasurer of the Inner Temple in 1507&#150;8, and in 1510 as serjeant-elect delivered a second or third reading, the text being part of the <span class="roman">Statute of Marlborough</span>. Four years later, on 1 June 1514, he was taken into the royal service as a king's serjeant. His will mentions three wives, the last of whom survived him. The first was Griselda, or Gresild (<i>d</i>. 1498), daughter of Henry Belknap (<i>d</i>. 1488) of Sussex; her sister Alice was the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25315/', "William Shelley")</script>, the future judge, who was another member of this Sussex circle belonging to the Inner Temple. Griselda died in 1498, and Caryll married as his second wife Margaret, sister of Thomas Ellenbridge of Merstham, Surrey, with whom he had two sons. As his third wife, Caryll married Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23247/', "Chief Justice Sir Robert Rede")</script>, with whom, according to his will, he had four more sons.<br>
<br>Caryll is one of the first identifiable English law reporters. His reports were well known by their author's name until the beginning of the seventeenth century. In 1602 about half of them, beginning in 1496, were printed by John Croke from a manuscript formerly belonging to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15257/', "Robert Keilwey")</script>. This edition, which has always been cited as <span class="italic">Keilwey</span>, was reprinted in 1633 and 1688. Although Croke did not mention Caryll as the reporter, it is obvious that the reports cannot have been written by Keilwey himself, who did not become a member of the Inner Temple until the 1530s, and indeed no such claim is made anywhere in the printed book. Whether Keilwey's manuscript was even the autograph is doubtful, since the latter is known to have passed to Caryll's eldest son, John (<i>d</i>. 1566), and there is no reason why he should have parted with it during his lifetime. Keilwey was a close friend of the son, who was about ten years his senior in the Inner Temple, and was presumably given an opportunity to copy from his manuscripts. Other copies were certainly made, and the reports were known later in the century both to Dyer and Coke. Coke, indeed, once referred to &#145;the written report of the famous Caryll of the Inner Temple&#146;  (translated from BL, Add. MS 16169, fol. 192).<br>
<br>The Keilwey text did not, however, represent the whole of Caryll's reports, which began about 1486 or 1487. The earliest notes attributable to him are in BL, Harley MS 5158, a collection of year-books which contains the names of Baker and Caryll in the <i>explicits</i>, and the name Johannes Caryll on the original vellum cover. Among the glosses and insertions are cases written in the second half of the 1480s, together with a number of disputations from the Inner Temple. The whole manuscript is full of marginal notes and cross-references, some of them attributable to the younger John Caryll, who refers in several places to Caryll's reports by name and in two places more explicitly cites &#145;the reports of my father&#146; and &#145;the abridgment of my father&#146;. A number of other manuscript texts can be attributed to Caryll, and these in turn enable the identification of the wrongly dated vulgate year-books of Easter and Trinity terms 13 Hen. VII (fols. 18&#150;29) and the whole of 16 Hen. VII, first printed by Tottell in 1555, as being from the same source. From all these texts an edition has been published by the Selden Society.<br>
<br>By and large the reports are in the same anonymous style as the year-books, with a preponderance of common pleas cases, though there is some internal corroboration of authorship in the mention of five or six cases from the western circuit in 1503&#150;5 when Caryll was clerk of assize there. There are more numerous personal touches after 1514, when Caryll became king's serjeant; there is then a heavy emphasis on crown business, including notes of the duke of Buckingham's claims of that year, the Hunne affair of 1516, the May day riots of 1517, the earl of Derby's case, the important cases of 1515 and 1519 on benefit of clergy and sanctuary&#151;in which Henry VIII himself is reported as threatening to &#145;have that reformed which is encroached by abuse&#146;  (Croke, 191)&#151;and numerous references to revenue practice. With the exception of a brief note, the reports end in 1519, four years before Caryll died. It is a notable coincidence that the printed year-books of Henry VIII begin the next year and continue in series until Easter term 1523, the very term before the serjeant's death. Yet there is a difference of style and content between the two series, not to mention a complete absence of reports after 11 Hen. VIII in any of the manuscript texts of Caryll, and so the reports of 1520&#150;23 cannot convincingly be attributed to the same hand. Unlike John Port and John Spelman, Caryll generally kept his disputations completely separate from his reports of cases in the courts, which are written as a chronological register in the year-book tradition. Learning exercises from the Inner Temple are nevertheless found in several of the Caryll manuscripts that contain reports; and a substantial series from the 1480s was printed in <span class="italic">Keilwey</span> (fols. 102<i>v</i>&#150;137) as <span class="italic">Casus incerti temporis</span>.<br>
<br>Caryll died on 17 June 1523, and was buried in London, at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, in the aisle where the judges and serjeants sat. Little is known of his estate at death, though his principal property transactions were evidently in the vicinity of his seat at Warnham in Sussex. The serjeant directed in his will that his eldest son, John, was to be:<blockquote>sett to the lernyng of the lawes of the land, and he to have yerely for his exhibition in the Temple x s. at the lest, which I knowe will suffise for his exhibition yf he lyve and use himself well and honestly and wysely like a lerner and student.</blockquote>John was already a member of the Inner Temple, and before he became a bencher in 1537 had followed in his father's footsteps as a reporter of cases and of Inner Temple moots. In 1540 he was offered the coif, which he declined, taking instead the office of attorney-general of the first-fruits and tenths, whence he was promoted in 1544 to the lucrative office of attorney of the duchy. He held the duchy office until his death on 10 March 1566, turning down the coif twice more, and continued reporting cases until at least 1560, though his reports (which were printed by the Selden Society in 2004) are not so full or as authoritative as those of his father.<br>
