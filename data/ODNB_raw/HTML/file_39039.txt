<span class="headword">Tuck,  Raphael</span>  (1821&#150;1900), <span class="occ">art publisher</span>, was born into a Jewish family in Germany. He came to England as a young man at a time when both Jews and gentiles from Germany were settling abroad, bringing with him his German wife, Ernestine, three years his junior, and his children, including four sons, Hermann, Adolph, Gustave, and Hugo, and three daughters, Julia, Rose, and Minnie.<br>
<br>The family settled in London, and there in 1866 Tuck established himself in a new building in Union Street, Spitalfields, his business being the production of chromos, oleographs, and black and white lithographs. His speciality from the start was the printing of coloured reproductions. In 1871 Tuck turned his attention to the printing of Christmas cards, entrusting the venture to his son Adolph, who had joined the business the previous year at the young age of sixteen. His brothers Hermann and Gustave subsequently joined him. Four years later, on 30 January 1875, Raphael Tuck was naturalized as a British citizen.<br>
<br>The large editions produced by Tuck's firm every season enabled them to provide cards of quality even in the cheapest ranges. Special attention was paid to design and finish. A close watch was also kept on changing tastes over the years, and Tuck aimed to meet the popular demand, however ephemeral, for a particular theme or design. In 1880 the firm held its first Christmas cards competition and exhibition, with prizes of 500 guineas awarded for the best designs submitted. Moreover, as well as offering prize money of this kind, the firm bought designs to the value of over &pound;2500 from competitors. The exhibition itself was held in the Dudley Galleries in London, and together with the competition gave considerable impetus to the Christmas card trade.<br>
<br>Tuck was equally ambitious in his commissions. Such well-known painters as Sir Edward Poynter, Marcus Stone, William Dobson, John Horsely, George Storey, and James Sant were engaged to paint a series of appropriate designs. Nor was the literary merit of the cards overlooked, and Tuck offered 1000 guineas to Tennyson to compose verses of eight lines each for cards of different types. It is doubtful whether the poet laureate ever had a more generous offer for such a small commission. The firm also organized a competition for amateur artists, again with handsome prizes for work accepted. The submissions were judged by a panel of eminent academicians, including Millais, Marcus Stone, G. H. Boughton, and Solomon J. Solomon. Tuck is cited by Boase (711) as being for many years &#145;publisher to the Queen and Prince of Wales&#146;.<br>
<br>Tuck remained in active touch with all operations of the thriving business until his retirement at the age of sixty in 1881, when the increasingly cramped quarters of the Union Street premises necessitated a move to Coleman Street, in the City. Further branches of the business opened in separate buildings elsewhere, specializing in the publication of cards, calendars, and educational books, until it was realized that new, unified premises were needed. A search was made for a suitable site, and one was found in Moorfields. Construction of the new Raphael House, as it was to be called, began in September 1897, by which time publication of the familiar pictorial postcards had begun. On 5 April 1898 Tuck laid the foundation stone of the new premises, and in July the following year personally opened the building. He died of influenza at his family home, 19 Balfour Road, Highbury, London, on 16 March 1900.<br>
