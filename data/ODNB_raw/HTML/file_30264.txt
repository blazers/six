<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Henry Edward Fox</span>  (1808&#150;1870), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, the third son of the colonial governor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30254/', "Sir Aretas William Young (1777/8&#150;1835)")</script>, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox, of Coolcliffe, Wexford, was born on 23 April 1808 at Bradbourne, near Lee, Kent. After being educated at Deane's School, Bromley, he entered the Inner Temple in 1827 but was never called to the bar. In 1830 he went to Trinidad with his father, then to British Guiana as clerk, aide-de-camp, and acting recorder of the chamber of orphans and protector of slaves.<br>
<br>On 21 November 1833 Young was appointed to be treasurer of St Lucia. He arrived in January 1834 and from August acted as colonial secretary and, helped by his knowledge of French, from November also as second puisne judge. In March 1835 he was promoted to government secretary of British Guiana. On 28 January 1847, on his return to England, Young was appointed lieutenant-governor of the eastern province of Cape Colony and was made CB and given a knighthood. In February 1848 he was offered the governorship of South Australia and returned to England, where, on 15 April 1848, he married Augusta Sophia Marryatt (<i>d</i>. 1913). They had two sons and five daughters. The couple set sail for Australia on 27 April, and Young took up his new post in August 1848.<br>
<br>Young's term of office as governor was marked by a vigorous but extravagant and not altogether judicious policy of development. He carried through the opening of the Murray River to steam navigation, but large sums were wasted trying to remove the bar at its mouth, and in 1854 a railway was built from Goolwa to the coast, although the port site was ill chosen. When the Victoria gold rush drained the colony of labour and money, Young's attempts to divert the stream of gold export to Adelaide and to encourage the discovery of gold in South Australia had some success; but the scarcity of currency led his advisers to fear that gold coin would disappear altogether. They persuaded Young, who was at first sceptical, to pass a measure to make gold bullion legal tender. The extraordinary measure, which was duly passed in January 1853, was short-lived.<br>
<br>In 1853 Young attempted to alter a bill for a constitution for responsible government. He published the resolutions framed by Sir John Morpherr when council was not sitting and withheld dispatches to have a bill passed keeping a nominated upper house. The resulting outcry saw the bill returned, and Young was censured by the secretary of state. Young was next gazetted to the government of New Zealand, but never took up his appointment, as in January 1855 he was transferred to the government of Tasmania. Here he arrived at a time of great prosperity, but again he was met by the urge for a greater degree of self-government; an act was before the queen in Great Britain, and meanwhile, on 17 July 1855, Young summoned his first council on the old footing. The council appointed a committee to review the findings of the executive council on the convict system and summoned the controller, Dr Hampton, to appear before it. Hampton denied the right of the council to summon him, while Young denied the right of the council to review the executive council's finding and prorogued the council. The Colonial Office upheld the prorogation but found fault with restrictions on the council; the supreme court and privy council found in favour of Hampton. In December 1856 Young met the first parliament under responsible government. However, he soon stood aside from politics to concentrate on the development of the country, which proceeded rapidly during his term of office. In 1857 steps were taken to improve higher education in Tasmania and gas was introduced into Hobart. The beginnings of a railway to Launceston were discussed; the first underwater telegraph cable was laid around the coast in 1858, and in 1860 the foundation of a mining industry was laid and an industrial exhibition was opened at Hobart. The new government house, a symbolic sign of the progress of colonialization, was first occupied by Young. He left the colony for England on 10 December 1861.<br>
<br>Young, who was a director and chairman of the Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Company from 1866 to 1868, also visited New Zealand on private business in 1866, but spent most of his time in London, where he died of kidney disease on 18 September 1870, at his home, 77 Kensington Gardens Square. A near contemporary described him as of a sanguine and enthusiastic temperament, devoted to what he believed to be his public duty, and usually generous in his judgements, if not always wise.<br>
