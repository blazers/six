<span class="headword">Capel,  James</span>  (1789&#150;1872), <span class="occ">stockbroker and philanthropist</span>, was born on 22 January 1789 at Kempsey, Worcestershire, the second child and eldest son of Henry Capel of Kempsey and his wife, Elizabeth Goile, of Fowicke, Worcestershire. James Capel married Marion Mary Cundy, who was probably the cousin of his father (she was the granddaughter of Henry Capel's grandfather, James Capel of Droitwich). They had four sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>James Capel went to London to enter the office of his cousin John Capel, a registered bill broker of 96 Cornhill, London, but in 1806 became a clerk in the office of Antrobus and Wood, stockbrokers. In 1813 he became a member of the London stock exchange, and a partner, at which time the firm changed its name to Antrobus, Brown, and Capel. In 1816 he was sworn a stockbroker as a member of the London Framework Knitters' Company, and in 1822 his firm changed its name again, becoming Marjoribanks, Capel, &amp; Co., and moved to new premises at 5 Throgmorton Street. The partnership was divided into seventeen parts, of which Marjoribanks and Capel each took five, Norbury three, Alexander Trotter two, and Richard White two. In 1837 the firm again changed its name, becoming James Capel, Norbury, Trotter &amp; Co., and James Capel became the senior partner. His son James Bury Capel was a partner in the firm by about 1844. The partnership was reconstituted in 1850, with James Capel controlling eight of the thirty shares, and again in 1864, when the firm became officially known as James Capel &amp; Co., although it had long been informally known in this way.<br>
<br>The early nineteenth century was a period of rapid development in the stock exchange, which had acquired its own premises in 1802. British funds were the principal securities traded, together with East India Company, South Sea Company, and Bank of England stock. From the second decade of the nineteenth century the stock exchange was listing canal shares and by the mid-1830s railway company shares were also listed. By 1824 there were 156 companies quoted, and by 1842 this number had risen to 755, but in spite of this rapid growth, as late as 1853 British funds amounted to three-quarters of the total nominal value of securities quoted on the stock exchange. The stockbroking firm with which James Capel was associated was one of the principal dealers in government funds. After 1815 foreign government securities also began to make their appearance in the London stock exchange. James Capel became a member of the foreign committee. In the 1840s trading in these securities became increasingly difficult and the Spanish government proposed to repudiate its bonds. James Capel became chairman of the Spanish Bondholders' Committee and as such persuaded both the London stock exchange and the Paris bourse to suspend dealings in these bonds. Eventually, in 1852, the Spanish government was persuaded to give up this proposal and James Capel was presented with a piece of plate by grateful Spanish bondholders.<br>
<br>In 1841 fraud and forgery upon a considerable scale in exchequer bills were uncovered, and James Capel gave evidence before the Treasury committee appointed to investigate the matter. The mid-1840s saw rapid growth in dealings in railway shares, a period known as the &#145;railway mania&#146;. James Capel &amp; Co. played some part in railway company flotation and in 1849 James Capel gave evidence before the House of Lords select committee on railway accounts. By 1847 James Capel &amp; Co., with five partners, was one of the two largest stockbroking firms in the London stock exchange, the other being Lawrence, Cazenove, and Pearson.<br>
<br>James Capel became one of the trustees and managers of the stock exchange in 1843, and chairman in 1853, when he oversaw the rebuilding of the premises of the stock exchange. He also became a member, and for twenty-five years chairman, of the Stock Exchange Fund for Decayed Members. By now he was living at 37 Fitzroy Square, London. He became treasurer of the London Orphan Asylum at Watford and remained in this office for eighteen years.<br>
<br>Marion Mary Capel died in Pisa at some time before 1861. James Capel himself died on 18 November 1872, at his home, 62 Westbourne Terrace, London. At the time of his death Capel was the oldest member of the stock exchange and was described by a contemporary as:<blockquote>a man of the strictest honour, untarnished reputation, exemplary in all business transactions, shrewd in his perceptions, keenly alive to the fluctuations of the market, clever at bargains for his clients, yet ever ready to act in a spirit of liberality in his dealings with his brother members of the Stock Exchange. (Guildhall MS 15096)</blockquote>
