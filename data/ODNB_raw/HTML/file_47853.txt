<span class="headword">Coit,  Stanton George</span>  (1857&#150;1944), <span class="occ">ethical reformer</span>, was born on 11 August 1857 in Columbus, Ohio, the fourth of the eight children of Harvey Coit and Elizabeth Greer. He was educated at Amherst College, Massachusetts, where he graduated in 1879. Rejecting both his mother's spiritualism and conventional theocratic Christianity, he joined the Society for Ethical Culture, New York city, of Felix Adler, who offered a heady mixture of Kantian idealism, Emersonian transcendentalism, and traditional Jewish emphasis on conduct. Coit committed himself to faith in ethical value unsupported by theological sanctions. After courses at Columbia College, New York, in 1881&#150;2, he took his doctorate at Berlin University (1885), where, shocked by the militarism of Heinrich von Treitschke, he became a socialist. The theme of Coit's dissertation, &#145;The inner sanction as final purpose for moral action&#146;, became the guiding principle of his life. In London, which he visited in 1885, he learned of social work settlements at Toynbee Hall, where educated young people lived with and worked for slum dwellers. Coit introduced the concept to Adler's working men's school in New York, and worked for the New York University Settlement.<br>
<br>On returning to London, Coit opened a neighbourhood guild in Kentish Town, the practice of which he explained in <span class="italic">Neighbourhood Guilds: an Instrument of Social Reform</span> (1891). In 1888 he was invited to become &#145;minister&#146; at an old established freethinking community, South Place Religious Society, at its chapel in Finsbury. Coit's appointment was due to enthusiastic support from the outgoing minister, Moncure Daniel Conway, an American author, journalist, and humanist. The society agreed to Coit's demand that the chapel be known as South Place Ethical Society. Coit was minister from 1888 to 1891 but he was forced to resign because the independent and largely non-socialist members believed he was coercing them into the new British ethical movement. Coit founded in 1894 the West London Ethical Society, the Moral Instruction League, and a socialist journal, <span class="italic">The Ethical World</span> (later <span class="italic">Democracy</span>). J. Ramsay MacDonald and J. A. Hobson were prolific contributors. It kept up a high standard of commentary, especially on ethical issues in politics. Coit also inspired the formation of several ethical societies, which proliferated into a modest but none the less national network. The Union of Ethical Societies (formed in 1896) was the germ of the British Humanist Association. On 21 December 1898 Coit married Fanny Adela Wetzlar, daughter of a Frankfurt industrialist, who helped her husband fund the radiation (as he called it) of ethical societies. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1903 Coit received naturalization as a British subject, joined the Independent Labour Party, and was adopted as parliamentary candidate for Wakefield. He participated in local affairs, and purchased the <span class="italic">Wakefield Echo</span>. He fought a vigorous campaign at the general election of 1906, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate by 217 votes. He was again defeated at Wakefield in January 1910. Coit's politics had a religious complexion: he was impressed by the ideas of J. R. Seeley on the social and psychological function of religion, expressed in <span class="italic">Natural Religion</span> (1882). The West London Ethical Society experimented with ethical worship. In 1909 Coit purchased a Methodist church in Bayswater, London, which he named the &#145;Ethical church&#146;; the society itself was also given this name in 1914. Stained-glass windows showed Elizabeth Fry, Bernard Shaw, and Saint Joan; from 1923 there was a white column inscribed &#145;An Altar to the Ideal, the True, the Beautiful and the Good&#146;. Coit prepared an elaborate service book, <span class="italic">Social Worship: for Use in Families, Schools and Churches</span> (1913), with musical arrangements by Charles Kennedy Scott. Coit's principles were expressed in <span class="italic">National Idealism and a State Church: a Constructive Essay in Religion</span> (1907), revised for American publication as <span class="italic">The Soul of America: a Constructive Essay in the Sociology of Religion</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">National Idealism: and the Book of Common Prayer: an Essay in Re-Interpretation and Revision</span> (1908). He hoped the Church of England would adopt some of his practices. Coit's ideas of the social, as opposed to supernatural, nature of religion were invigorated from 1923 by a study of Emile Durkheim's work and from 1930 by the <span class="italic">Ethics</span> of the German phenomenologist Nicolai von Hartmann, of which Coit, in his seventies, produced an esteemed English translation. Following Hartmann, he considered himself to be a Platonist. After the death of his wife he retired to Birling Gap, near Eastbourne, in 1933, and died there on 15 February 1944. In youth Coit was red-headed and of fiery temperament, which he retained in later years. He is vividly described in a novel, <span class="italic">The Prophet's Wife</span> (1929) by R. O. Prowse, a member of the Ethical church.<br>
