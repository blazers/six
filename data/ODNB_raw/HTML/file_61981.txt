<span class="headword">Low, Sir  Hugh</span>  (1824&#150;1905), <span class="occ">botanist and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 10 May 1824 in Clapton, London, the elder son of Hugh Low (1793&#150;1863), a Scot who had developed a substantial horticultural business in London, with a special interest in tropical plants. After attending private schools Low, at the age of nineteen, set off for south-east Asia for botanical study and plant collection. He became closely associated with James Brooke, who was then establishing his regime in Sarawak. Low also travelled widely in north Borneo and acquired exceptional knowledge of the land and people, which he demonstrated in his book <span class="italic">Sarawak: its Inhabitants and Productions</span> (1848). He returned to England but set out again in 1848 to take up the post of secretary to Brooke, now governor of Labuan. Low travelled out with William Napier, who was to be lieutenant-governor, and shortly after his arrival in Singapore married Napier's daughter, Catherine (1828/9&#150;1851), whose mother was Malay. They had a son, Hugh Brooke Low (1849&#150;1887), who later made his career in the Sarawak government service, and a daughter, Katherine Elizabeth 
    (Kitty; 1850&#150;1923)
  . On their mother's death in 1851 of fever the children went home to be brought up by Low's younger brother, Stuart, who had inherited the family business.<br>
<br>Labuan, a small island off the coast of Borneo, had disappointed British hopes that it would become a busy port and exporter of coal, and survived as a dreary, isolated, and very unhealthy place. As colonial treasurer, his principal post, Low managed the finances of a colony with a total annual revenue of only &pound;4000, including a British subsidy. The persistent quarrels among the small European community degenerated into open warfare during the governorship (from 1867 to 1871) of John Pope Hennessy. Although Hennessy married Low's strikingly beautiful teenage daughter in 1868, relations between the two men became so bitter that Hennessy resorted to habeas corpus proceedings to recover his wife and son from refuge in Low's house and suspended Low temporarily from duty for owning a house occupied by persons &#145;known to the police&#146; (Low's Malay mistress and their child). The Colonial Office censured both men, and stood firm in its refusal to give Low the governorship in which he had acted for a total of eight years. His main consolation, through the years of tedium and frustration, was his twelve-acre garden with a choice selection of plants, including many improved strains, for Low was always a practical horticulturist. He also travelled, and he climbed Mount Kinabalu, the highest in Borneo, three times, partly to collect specimens.<br>
<br>When Low returned to London in 1876 he was fifty-two and apparently reaching the end of a disappointing career. But the Colonial Office was in dire need of such a man, with an instinctive empathy for Asian people and proven ability, to fill the post of resident of the Malay state of Perak, since clumsy British action had caused deep resentment among the Malay ruling class, leading to military action that saddled Perak with war debts equal to three years' revenue. In the ensuing twelve years Low evolved, with brilliant and much acclaimed success, the &#145;Residential system&#146; of government in the Malay states. His success in economic development left Perak free of debt, with a ninefold increase in state revenue between 1877 and 1889. Although the Pangkor engagement of 1874 provided only for British advice (and control of state finances), it had been found necessary, in Low's words, &#145;to invent the government to be advised&#146; if the advice was to be implemented. Years later Frank Swettenham, who became Low's junior partner in the enterprise, wrote of Low's &#145;quiet voice and sympathetic manner&#146; combined with his &#145;rather venerable appearance&#146;, his &#145;belief that it would be a mistake to force the pace of change&#146;, and his insistence on &#145;the strictest economy&#146;  (Swettenham, 69). In the Malay regent of Perak (the sultan was in exile) Low had to deal with &#145;a malcontent of influence&#146;  (ibid.). Another observer, Brau de St Pol Lias, a French mining engineer, watching Low pilot contentious business through the state council, paid tribute to his lightness of touch. The Victorian traveller Isabella Bird was Low's house guest in 1879. She noted his courteous and informal relations with Malays, and later, in <span class="italic">The Golden Chersonese and the Way Thither</span> (1883), wrote a much quoted description of his elegant, simple but eccentric lifestyle, in which two apes, his pets, sat down to dinner with them. Although Low was denied a governorship, he was signally honoured with appointment as GCMG in 1889 (having been made CMG in 1879 and knighted KCMG in 1883). Botany and zoology continued to absorb him, and he became a fellow of the Linnaean Society and of the Royal Zoological Society, with whom he corresponded.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1885 Low married, at the parish church in Bradford, Somerset, Anne Penelope Harriet Douglas (1851/2&#150;1927), eldest daughter of General Sir Robert Percy Douglas, fourth baronet, governor of Jersey (1858&#150;63) and lieutenant-governor of the Cape of Good Hope (1863&#150;8). There were no children of the marriage. He retired in 1889 and lived on, with the aura of success, for fifteen years, dying on 18 April 1905, at the Salisbury Hotel, Alassio, Italy.<br>
