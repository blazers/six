<span class="headword">Marbeck <span class="st"> [Merbecke]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1585?), <span class="occ">composer and writer</span>, was probably born in Beverley, Yorkshire, and may have trained as a chorister of the minster there. The chapter's payment to him during 1531&#150;2 of a gratuity of 4<i>s</i>. in return for his donating musical compositions suggests that he had earlier connections with the church, and had made his gift on the occasion of a family visit to the town, where one Robert Marbeck was a substantial tenant of minster property. It is likely that John was taken thence by commission to be a chorister of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and that he received there the rest of his education, since in the preface of his <span class="italic">Concordance</span> (1550), addressed to Edward VI, he states that he was &#145;altogether brought up in your highnes College at Wyndsore, in the study of Musike and plaiyng on Organs&#146;. The earliest mention of his name occurs in an inventory of domestic plate belonging to the vicars-choral and minor canons of St George's dated 1 May 1531; among the items was &#145;one sylver spone wrytyn theron John Marbeke&#146;. He married about this time, for in 1543 he was reported to have had five or six children; one of them, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18027/', "Roger Marbeck")</script>, later became provost of Oriel College, Oxford, and physician to Elizabeth I. The earliest surviving payment to Marbeck dates from 1541&#150;2, when he received 40<i>s</i>. for playing the organ; however, his employment was principally as one of the lay clerks who, with the minor canons, vicars-choral and choristers, sang the liturgy in plainsong and polyphony at eight daily services in St George's.<br>
<br>In September 1540 Marbeck wrote out the will of William Tate, canon of St George's, who bequeathed him &pound;5. However, his activities as a copyist, combined with a thirst for biblical knowledge, nearly brought him to the stake, for in March 1543 he was arrested and charged with heresy along with Henry Filmer, Anthony Peerson, and Robert Testwood, a fellow lay clerk of the Windsor choir. The events surrounding Marbeck's detention are related in the preface to his <span class="italic">Concordance</span> and in the account that he prepared for the second edition of Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span> (1570). During the mid-1530s Marbeck apparently became deeply interested in theology, and when the English &#145;Matthew&#146; <span class="roman">Bible</span> appeared in 1537, he resolved to own a copy. Being unable to afford one, he began writing it out by hand, but later diverted his energies to the more useful enterprise of compiling a concordance to the same publication. However, by the late 1530s a Catholic reaction to reform had set in, and Marbeck and his associates were arrested under the provisions of the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>. On 16 March 1543 Marbeck's house at Windsor was searched, and books and manuscripts, including his nearly finished concordance, were confiscated as evidence. After appearing before the privy council, he was committed to the Marshalsea on charges of expressing contempt for the mass and of writing and possessing heretical documents. His interrogation mainly concerned his work on the concordance, but he was also closely examined on the copy of a John Calvin letter (probably the <span class="italic">De fugiendis impiorum illicitis sacris</span> of 1537) that had been found in Marbeck's handwriting. His defence was that he had copied it for a priest named Marshall before the six articles became law, and therefore could not be judged guilty. Four months after their arrest, the accused were returned to Windsor where, at their trial on 26 July, all four were found guilty and sentenced to death. Three died in the flames two days later, but Marbeck obtained a royal reprieve and eventually a full pardon. In the first edition of his <span class="italic">Acts</span> (1563), Foxe reported that Marbeck was martyred with the others, though he corrected this statement in the corrigenda and later editions. On his release, Marbeck returned to his musical duties at Windsor and resumed work <i>ab initio</i> on his concordance.<br>
<br>The death of Henry VIII removed one of the main obstacles to protestant reform, and Marbeck greeted the new reign with enthusiasm. On 1 December 1547 his name headed the list of fourteen lay clerks in a petition presented to Edward VI's commissioners. In 1549 he supplicated Oxford University for the degree of BMus, but it is not known if it was granted. A year later Marbeck published his <span class="italic">Concordance</span> and <span class="italic">The Booke of Common Praier Noted</span>. Both works broke new ground, the former being the first concordance in English to cover the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and the latter the first musical setting of services prescribed by the 1549 prayer book. Initially the <span class="italic">Concordance</span> could not find a publisher on account of its great length, so Marbeck produced a third, abbreviated version, itself of over 900 folios each divided into three columns. In the preface he expressed regret at having &#145;consumed vainly the greatest part of my life&#146; as a church musician. <span class="italic">The Booke of Common Praier Noted</span> was composed for the use of cathedral and collegiate choirs, and represents an attempt to reconcile the austerity of Reformation attitudes to music with the assumption evident in the rubrics of the 1549 prayer book that such choirs would continue to exist. Marbeck provided monodic settings in syllabic style of the preces and responses, matins, evensong, <span class="roman">Benedicite</span>, <span class="italic">Quicunque vult</span>, communion, and burial of the dead, placing utter priority on the audibility of the words. Within two years his book was rendered obsolete by the appearance of the second Edwardian prayer book. Certain later composers, however, used Marbeck's melody for the preces and responses as the basis of their own polyphonic settings.<br>
<br>St George's found itself at the forefront of Edwardian attempts to restrict the scope of music at cathedral and collegiate foundations. The royal injunctions of 8 February 1550 reduced the number of choristers and laid down stringent guidelines for the appointment of future singers, placing more emphasis on virtue than on musical skill. A further set of injunctions issued in October excluded Marbeck and his colleague George Thaxton from duty as organists, though they still received a stipend. In 1552 the Windsor chapter granted Marbeck the reversion of the presentation of the benefice of Tintagel, Cornwall.<br>
<br>After his near-martyrdom in the early 1540s, Marbeck abstained from religious controversy during Queen Mary's reign, which saw the reformed services abolished and the Latin rite restored. The only records concerning him in these years relate to his work as a copyist: in 1553&#150;4 and 1555&#150;6 he received payment for examining and correcting books for the choir, and in 1557&#150;8 he wrote out a collectarium for one of the canons. At the time of Elizabeth I's accession Marbeck was serving as both lay clerk and organist of St George's. In the two terms following Christmas 1558 he was remunerated both as joint organist with Mr Preston and as supervisor of the choristers; however, he had ceased to hold the latter post by 1562&#150;3 when he and Robert Golder are described as &#145;agitatores organorum&#146;. By 1564 Marbeck was merely a lay clerk and sole organist. He headed the list of lay clerks for the last time in 1571, when Henry Hastings, the puritan earl of Huntingdon, recommended his appointment to the nominal office of chaplain to the Hastings chantry in St George's, a sinecure whose profits doubtless helped to provide financial security in his retirement. He devoted the rest of his life to writing a series of theological works, some of which violently attacked the papacy. They include: <span class="italic">The Lyves of Holy Sainctes</span> (1574), <span class="italic">The Holie Historie of King David</span> (1579), <span class="italic">A Booke of Notes and Common Places</span> (1581), <span class="italic">The Rippinge up of the Popes Fardell</span> (1581), <span class="italic">Examples Drawen out of Holy Scripture</span> (1582), and <span class="italic">A Dialogue between Youth and Old Age</span> (1584). He died presumably in 1585, when John Mundy succeeded to the post of organist.<br>
<br>Marbeck is chiefly remembered for <span class="italic">The Booke of Common Praier Noted</span> which, since its revival in the mid-nineteenth century, has been widely used and adapted by Anglicans and other denominations. His four surviving polyphonic works include &#145;A virgin and mother&#146;, possibly adapted from a setting of a Latin text, and a five-part mass of about 1530 based on <span class="italic">Per arma justiciae</span>, the antiphon sung at terce during Lent. His two large-scale votive antiphons, <span class="italic">Domine Jesu Christe</span> and <span class="italic">Ave Dei patris</span>, are typical of the genre in falling into triple- and duple-time halves, with passages for reduced voices alternating with those for full choir.<br>
