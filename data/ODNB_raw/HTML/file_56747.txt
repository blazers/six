<span class="headword">Burn,  Andrew</span>  (1742&#150;1814), <span class="occ">marine officer and religious writer</span>, was born in Dundee on 8 September 1742, the son of George John Burn and Christian Donie. When business failure induced his father to become a naval purser the sixteen-year-old Andrew accompanied him as an assistant clerk on active service in the North Sea and West Indies. Through the good offices of a family friend he obtained a commission in the marines at Chatham in 1761. With the coming of peace in 1763 Burn went on half pay and spent the next six years in France as tutor to a young man. He returned home bankrupt from gambling and with the piety of his upbringing undermined by deistic philosophy. He was brought to face the emptiness of his life by the death of his brother, and in 1772 he experienced an evangelical conversion. He became a keen student of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, a man of disciplined prayer, and, through the medium of a detailed journal, a sharply introspective critic of his own shortcomings.<br>
<br>During the American War of Independence, Burn experienced active service off North America and a posting to the East Indies, but with his health permanently damaged by tropical disease he was allowed to return to home waters. On 11 February 1771 Burn had married Mary Southerden (<i>d</i>. 1785) at Rochester. After her death he married Sarah Grigg (1763&times;6&#150;1828) also at Rochester on 2 February 1786. Both unions produced several children.<br>
<br>In the French Revolutionary War, Burn took part in the capture of the Cape of Good Hope from the Dutch in 1796, served under Admiral Sir John Jervis in the Mediterranean in the <i>Goliath</i> (74 guns), and was senior marine officer at the battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. After his promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the army and major in his own corps, Burn's military service was in administration, training, and garrison duties, most notably as colonel commandant of the Woolwich division (1808&#150;14). His final promotion was to major-general on the army list in July 1810 before his retirement in 1814 after 53 years in the marines. With ten sons and daughters to support on his military pay he was never a wealthy man. Contemporaries recalled his integrity and kindness, but his lasting reputation rests upon his religious writings.<br>
<br>In 1789 Burn published <span class="italic">The Christian Officer's Panoply</span>, retitled <span class="italic">Complete Armour</span> for the second edition in 1806. Burn's thesis is that reason alone cannot lead to knowledge of God which must come by divine revelation. His next work, <span class="italic">Who Fares Best, the Christian or the Man of the World?</span> (also 1789) used dialogue to compare (in the words of the subtitle) &#145;the advantages of a life of real piety to one of fashionable dissipation&#146;. Burn sought to demonstrate that the Christian believer enjoyed all the rational joys of life enriched by daily fellowship with God in prayer, and fortified in the face of death with the assurance of eternal glory in the presence of his Saviour. These are substantial little works, reflecting a well educated mind and a secure grasp of basic Calvinist theology. In addition he wrote an evangelistic tract for a military readership and a pamphlet in support of the Bible Society.<br>
<br>Burn died at Gillingham, Kent, on 18 September 1814 and was buried on 22 September at St Margaret's, Rochester. Published in 1815, his posthumous memoirs are edited extracts from his publications and personal journals, richer in spiritual introspection than factual detail, and unlikely to appeal far beyond his own day.<br>
<br>For one at the top of his profession Burn made surprisingly little impact upon the history of his famous corps, with but passing notice in officer lists and routine papers and little contact with the wider evangelical world. Such straitened recognition would scarcely have troubled the Burn who emerges from his writings: an unassuming character uncomfortable with rank and eminence, a soldier of proven courage who had no love for war, and a writer indifferent to fashionable opinion so long as he could commend the Christian gospel to his readers.<br>
