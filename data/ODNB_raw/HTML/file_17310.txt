<span class="headword">Lyttelton,  Thomas</span>, second Baron Lyttelton  (1744&#150;1779), <span class="occ">libertine and politician</span>, was born at Hagley, Worcestershire, on 30 January 1744, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17306/', "George Lyttelton, first Baron Lyttelton of Frankley (1709&#150;1773)")</script>, and Lucy (1717/18&#150;1747), daughter of Hugh Fortescue of Filleigh, Devon. The dissolute son of a pious father, Lyttelton attracted fascinated, and horrified, attention in life and death.<h2>
<a name="Youth"></a>Youth</h2>He was educated at Marylebone boarding-school between 1756 and 1758 before proceeding to Eton College. He was a precocious boy, and his father had praised him at fifteen for his charm and intelligence, but added: &#145;my only fear is that he may please the ladies too well&#146;  (<span class="italic">Elizabeth Montagu</span>, 140): George begged his friend Elizabeth Montagu to instil the prudent advice that &#145;no charms are truly amiable but those that are under the government of wisdom and virtue&#146;  (ibid., 140&#150;41). By the time Tom was sixteen, doubts were multiplying. At the grand opening of the new Hagley Hall in 1760 he was commissioned, according to Charles Townshend, &#145;to have opened the ball with the first person of the first class, mutinied, and would dance only with a smart girl he had brought in the morning from a neighbouring village&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, 242). In November 1761 he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he received a long letter of advice from Mrs Montagu, explaining that &#145;the morning of life, like the morning of day, should be dedicated to business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Elizabeth Montagu</span>, 253), and advising him to study history.<br>
<br>In 1763 Lyttelton's father began to negotiate a marriage for him with Anne, daughter of Lieutenant-General Warburton of Winnington, Cheshire. Since the arrangements could not be legalized until he was of age, it was decided to send him on the grand tour to mark time, with expenses paid by his wealthy uncle, Sir Richard Lyttleton. This was a mistake. His companions included the Damer brothers, also Etonians, and scarcely calculated to encourage sobriety. George Damer became involved in a scandal with an Italian coachman, whose family had to be bought off; in 1776 John Damer at the age of thirty-two shot himself in a brothel in Covent Garden in the company of three prostitutes and a blind fiddler. Within a few months Lyttelton had run up heavy gambling debts and had fought two duels. Edward Gibbon, who did devote himself to history, met Lyttelton in Rome and complained that he monopolized the conversation &#145;avec une volubilit&eacute; &eacute;tonnante&#146;  (Gibbon, 121). Further acquaintance confirmed &#145;beaucoup de gasconade&#146;  (ibid., 143) and Lyttelton shocked the future historian of the Roman empire by insisting that one could do Rome in twenty days. Nor was Sir Horace Mann, the diplomat, more impressed: &#145;a very odd young man &hellip; his contradictory temper makes it impossible for him to agree with anybody, and his behaviour in general disobliges and offends so that he is shunned both by the English and Italians&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 22.251). A further consequence of his conduct, soon reported home, was that Miss Warburton began to have second thoughts: &#145;she is trying to find someone she can like better&#146; explained Mrs Montagu  (Blunt, 53). The match was called off.<br>
<br>On returning home in 1765, Lyttelton soon quarrelled with his father and went abroad again, spending some time in prison in Paris after a scuffle in a brothel. Mrs Montagu amiably attributed his misfortunes to &#145;inexperience&#146;  (Blunt, 70), but conceded that &#145;Mr Lyttelton has so many times acted out the same indiscretions that to assist him again would only be to encourage him&#146;  (ibid.). Extricated once more, he stood for Bewdley, a single-seat borough disputed between the Winnington and Lyttelton families, and, after a singularly rowdy election, was returned at the general election of 1768. In a maiden speech in May 1768 he warned of trouble ahead in America, and in November spoke in favour of hearing John Wilkes's complaints. But in January 1769 he was unseated on petition. Looking back on his stay in the Commons, Lyttelton regretted it had been so brief: &#145;I was possessed of that ready faculty of speech which would have enabled me to make some little figure in the Senate &hellip; I mingled in public debate, and received the most flattering testimonies of applause&#146;  (Blunt, 80&#150;81). Immediately after his expulsion from the house, Lyttelton resumed his continental travels, mainly in Italy and the Low Countries. John Gray, the historian, journeyed with him from Venice to Milan in the spring of 1771, and commented that he gambled &#145;like a madman&#146;  (Melville, 244). He was also susceptible to gross flattery and &#145;should others be silent, he will trumpet forth his own excellencies&#146;  (ibid., 245).<br>
<br>Baulked for the time being of a political career, Lyttelton embarked on matrimony. On 26 June 1772, at Halesowen, Staffordshire, he married Apphia (1743&#150;1840), widow of Joseph Peach, governor of Calcutta, and daughter of Broome Witts, of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. &#145;Lord Lyttelton's son&#146;, wrote Mrs Boscawen, &#145;has persuaded a very rich (and very worthy) East Indian widow &hellip; to take him with all his faults; it is to be hoped she will help him to amend them, for tis so great a work that he will want assistance&#146;  (Delany, 2nd ser., 1.443). To the dismay of his father, who seems to have admired his prospective daughter-in-law more than her fianc&eacute; did, Lyttelton brought forward the marriage, less from ardour than because he needed the &pound;20,000 dowry rather urgently. The experiment failed, and the following year&#151;as told in the broadside <span class="italic">The Rape of Pomona</span>&#151;he absconded to Paris with a barmaid from Bolton's Inn at Hockerill. He was back in time to take part in another drunken brawl in July 1773 over the actress Elizabeth Hartley, an event celebrated in another pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Vauxhall Affray</span>. From these fresh predicaments he was rescued in August 1773 by the death of his father, which enabled him to resume his parliamentary career.<h2>
<a name="LytteltonintheLords"></a>Lyttelton in the Lords</h2>Provided with a new audience, Lyttelton took up his role in the Lords with some enthusiasm. On 22 February 1774 he spoke on the issue of literary property, in favour of authors' rights. He followed in June by supporting the <span class="roman">Quebec Bill</span>, insisting that the French Canadians had proved their loyalty and were entitled to toleration: &#145;the gloomy reign of persecution and priestcraft were now at an end&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 17, 1773&#150;4, 1405). Throughout 1774 and most of 1775, despite his admiration for the former prime minister William Pitt, earl of Chatham, Lyttelton supported the government's attempts to bring the Americans into submission, insisting that there was no distinction between legislation and taxation. On 20 January 1775, when Chatham moved that troops be withdrawn from Boston, Lyttelton asserted his independent support for the administration: &#145;now, therefore [is] the time to assert the authority of Great Britain&#146;  (ibid., 18, 1775&#150;6, 163). Horace Walpole thought highly of his eloquence, and his reported speeches are far from foolish. On 12 May 1775, in a long speech, he moved the second reading of a bill to allow a playhouse in Manchester, remarking that recreation was particularly necessary in new industrial towns and that &#145;the sixpence spent at a theatre is much better laid out than at an ale-house&#146;  (ibid., 635). He had a dislike for the former lord chancellor Charles Pratt, first Baron Camden, whom he attacked on 7 February, and again on 17 May when Camden moved to repeal the <span class="roman">Quebec Act</span>. Lyttelton defended it as an excellent bill, based upon the principle of toleration, and insisted that Camden's intentions were to raise a storm and distress ministers. He was sufficiently pleased with his speech to have it printed and circulated.<br>
<br>But when in the course of the summer his exertions went unrewarded, Lyttelton demonstrated that he could bite. When the new session began in October 1775 he changed sides abruptly and became a savage critic of those whom he had once courted. On 26 October he defended Chatham in his absence, declared that ministers were not to be trusted, and demanded that all acts regarded by the Americans as grievances should be rescinded. On this occasion Lyttelton struck lucky, catching Lord North in one of his moments of despondency. William Nassau de Zuylestein, fourth earl of Rochford, one of the secretaries of state, was unwell and anxious to resign, and Augustus Henry Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton, the lord privy seal, was so dissatisfied that the king urged his dismissal. On 7 November, North warned the king that the ministry was in danger of dissolution. On the same day he minuted that &#145;Lord Lyttelton has this morning agreed to give a constant support to administration upon condition that he may expect before the end of the session a Privy Council office of the value of &pound;1500 a year&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.280). The outcome was Lyttelton's appointment to the lucrative sinecure of chief justice in eyre, north of Trent, and a second volte-face. On 10 November he attacked &#145;the audacious, insidious rebels&#146; in America and was warmly congratulated by the first lord of the Admiralty, John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, on &#145;the finest [speech] ever delivered within these walls&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 18, 1775&#150;6, 927, 931). &#145;This hopeful young man&#146;, commented Walpole:<blockquote>who on being refused a place spoke <i>for</i> the Americans, and in two days, on getting one, <i>against</i> them, being reproached with such precipitate changes, said that with his fortune nobody could expect he thought of the value of the salary. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 24.151)</blockquote>For most of the rest of his life Lyttelton supported the government, playing a useful, if subsidiary, role. On 14 March 1776 he opposed Grafton's motion for conciliation, saying it would make Britain a laughing-stock; after Saratoga he said that Britain should not give up because of one set-back (5 December 1777), and on 7 December 1778 that the Americans were to blame for the savagery of the contest. But during 1779 he, like others, began to despair. In April he stood aside while Sandwich was attacked, admitting that America could not be regained. According to Walpole he had turned against the court on not being given the seals as secretary of state on the death of Henry Howard, twelfth earl of Suffolk. In June 1779 the king, in a memorandum on a change of government, noted: &#145;Lord Lyttelton to be removed, his place offered to Lord Beauchamp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 4.352). On 27 September 1779 he wrote to North to remove Lyttelton, &#145;whose private character makes him no credit to my service&#146;  (ibid., 4.451). Rather than walk the plank, Lyttelton jumped. On 25 November he launched a violent attack upon the ministers: the war was now a madness and the government &#145;a rope of sand, crumbling away day by day&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 20, 1778&#150;9, 1041). This would presumably have done the trick and secured Lyttelton's dismissal had he not died, two days afterwards, at his Surrey home, Pitt Place, Epsom, at the age of thirty-five. He was buried at Hagley.<h2>
<a name="Lifeafterdeath"></a>Life after death</h2>Even after his death Lyttelton continued to astonish the world. Within days rumours were circulating of supernatural happenings, and as a ghost Lyttelton stalked throughout much of the nineteenth century. There were two separate accounts. The first, attested by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17311/', "William Henry Lyttelton, first Baron Westcote")</script>, Lyttelton's uncle and successor in the Hagley estate, was that before his death Lyttelton had told his friends that a woman had appeared to him, first in the guise of a robin, and prophesied his death within three days. The irrepressible Walpole thought it must be the first time that any female had found difficulty in obtaining entry to Lyttelton's bedchamber. On the third evening Lyttelton had joked that they had &#145;bilked the ghost&#146;, but soon after he retired to bed his manservant found him dead. In view of the life he had led it would be idle to speculate on what illness had carried him off, though &#145;cramp in his stomach&#146; was suggested  (<span class="italic">Eighth Report</span>, HMC, 1.206). The second story was that, at the very moment of his death, his figure had appeared to a friend 30 miles away. The purpose of neither visit was closely identified but Lyttelton would have been pleased to know that he died as he had lived, much talked about.<br>
<br>Lyttelton is credited with two works, neither proven with certainty. <span class="italic">Poems by a Young Nobleman Lately Deceased</span> appeared in 1780, and in a second edition the author was identified as Lyttelton. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> thought the poems &#145;poor, contemptible, and vulgar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 62, 1780, 131), and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> regretted that they had ever been printed. <span class="italic">Letters by the Late Thomas Lord Lyttelton</span>, distinctly wordy, also appeared in 1780. They were later claimed by William Combe, author of <span class="italic">Dr Syntax</span>, but his role may have been that of an enthusiastic editor. The suggestion, briefly canvassed, that Lyttelton was the author of the <span class="italic">Letters of Junius</span> is preposterous, since he is known to have been on the continent for almost all the time that the letters were appearing.<br>
