<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>,  John</span>, second Lord Seagrave  (1256&#150;1325), <span class="occ">soldier and baron</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25039/', "Nicholas Seagrave, first Lord Seagrave (1238?&#150;1295)")</script>, and his wife, Matilda, who was probably a Lucy. In 1270 John married Christiana, daughter of Hugh de Plessis, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22379/', "John de Plessis, earl of Warwick")</script>. Although his family had been on the side of Simon de Montfort during the civil war of the 1260s, John Seagrave had established links with the future Edward I by way of the crusade. He served in the Welsh campaigns of 1277 and 1282&#150;3, in Ireland in 1287, and in Scotland in 1291. He was summoned to serve in Gascony in 1297 (although he did not go), and was actively employed against the Scots from that year until 1322, during which time he held positions of strategic and military importance. Following the death of his father he was summoned to parliament as a peer from 26 August 1296 to 8 May 1325.<br>
<br>In 1297 John Seagrave entered into an indenture with Roger (IV) Bigod, earl of Norfolk and the earl marshal, to provide Bigod in time of war with sixteen or, as the occasion demanded it, twenty cavalry. If Seagrave was required in peacetime, his party would receive <i>bouche a court</i> (food and drink), and he, as a banneret, and his knights would be provided with robes equal to any of their rank in the earl's household. As part of the agreement Bigod enfeoffed Seagrave with the manor and advowson of Lodden in Norfolk for the duration of his service. Later that year Seagrave offered Edward I the earl's excuses&#151;he had been ill&#151;for not attending in person to serve with the king in Flanders. On 22 August 1297 Seagrave accompanied Roger (IV) Bigod and Humphrey (VI) de Bohun, earl of Hereford, to the exchequer, where they delivered a letter protesting at the levy of an eighth procured by Edward I and complaining of the burdensome nature and unconstitutionality of the king's extension of the traditional obligations of taxation. But Seagrave did homage to Edward I at Carlisle on 30 June 1300 and on 12 February 1301 set his seal to the barons' letter of complaint to the pope. In the same year, following an inquiry and discussion concerning the role of the marshal of England, Seagrave, who had acted as deputy marshal on the Scottish campaign after Bigod's withdrawal in 1298, was paid &pound;100 in place of the customary perquisites of the office, usually an entitlement to booty. This agreement was only reached by the inclusion of a proviso that this would not create a precedent, and that neither the marshal nor his deputy would be regarded as having failed in their duties.<br>
<br>In August 1302 Seagrave was made constable of the castle of Berwick, and in November became the king's lieutenant in Scotland (positions he held until 1305). With the ending of the truce with the Scots in late September he was ordered to make a mounted foray past Stirling as far up as Kirkintilloch, assisted by various northern lords. In February of the following year he organized a raid through Scottish territory, and was ambushed near Maid's Castle, wounded, and captured, but later rescued. He continued to mount raids against the Scots during the winter of 1303&#150;4, and having taken care to avoid infiltration by Scottish spies, managed to rout a force led by William Wallace and Simon Fraser. Although they escaped capture, Seagrave worked closely with Robert Bruce in tracking them down, and was encouraged by Edward I proverbially to make good the hood as well as they had made the cloak. Wallace was eventually handed over into Seagrave's custody in the summer of 1305, escorted to London, and tried at a special commission of gaol delivery. Seagrave was one of the justices. Following Wallace's conviction and execution Seagrave was given the task of escorting the quarters of the dead man's body north to their final destinations (Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling, and Perth), for which he received 15<i>s</i>. in remuneration. In 1306, in consideration of the labours and troubles suffered by his wife, Christiana, in living in Scotland while her husband was there in the king's service, they were granted a scutage of 40<i>s</i>. for each fee held of the inheritance of her late father for the regnal year 1302&#150;3.<br>
<br>In January 1308 Seagrave was summoned to attend Edward II's coronation, and in March of the same year was appointed constable of Nottingham Castle and justice (or keeper) of the forest north of the Trent. However, he was forced to resign the latter office in favour of Piers Gaveston on 1 October 1310 (for this he was given pecuniary compensation), but he was restored to it for life on 4 September 1312. He was also appointed keeper of Scotland either side of the Forth in 1309, and, four years later, keeper of the marches in Cumberland. In June 1311 Seagrave was warned not to become embroiled in a quarrel between Walter Birmingham and his own brother, Henry Seagrave, who had been sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk and constable of Norwich Castle, and was besieged in Norwich. In 1315 John Seagrave appears to have suffered a similar fate, since he complained that the townsfolk of Nottingham had rung the common bell, broken down the gates of the castle, assaulted his men, and besieged him there for eight days without allowing access for provisions. In August 1318 he was appointed to the continual council set up under the treaty of Leake, which was required to give assent to Edward II's actions outside parliament.<br>
<br>Two years later Seagrave was made a keeper of the peace in Warwickshire. With the disintegration of relations between Edward II and Thomas of Lancaster, Seagrave was urged in January and April 1321 to avoid illegal or treasonable gatherings, and in November not to attend a meeting of peers. In the same month he was required to muster both cavalry and infantry in the counties of Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire against the rebel forces. In February 1322 he was ordered to raise as many foot soldiers and men-at-arms as possible, and as constable of Nottingham Castle he was to ensure the castle was provisioned and defended. Later in the same year he was commanded to array his men and tenants to appear at York. After the civil war Seagrave's attention was refocused on Scotland, and in late 1322 and early 1323 he was ordered to array men in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire in preparation for an invasion. In July 1324 he went to Aquitaine as captain of the forces for the duchy, and in November of the same year was summoned to fight in Gascony.<br>
<br>Over the course of his life John Seagrave acquired numerous lands and perquisites. According to the dictum of Kenilworth the Seagrave lands had an annual value of 500 marks (&pound;330) per annum, which was a figure about the middle of the spectrum for baronial landholding. In a charter dated 4 July 1270 John and Christiana were granted the manor of Stottesdon in Shropshire by Hugh de Plessis &#145;in free marriage&#146;; it was to be held by Seagrave of the king for one knight's fee. In 1281 Roger of Kingswood conveyed to John and Christiana all the lands held of them in Kingswood in Shropshire in exchange for lands and woods at Cherle and the watermill there. Before receiving livery of his father's lands in 1295 Seagrave held a quarter of a knight's fee at Calvedon in Warwickshire in 1275, one knight's fee in Atterton and Witherley in Lincolnshire in 1282, the manor of Penn in Buckinghamshire in 1289, and Blyborough in Lincolnshire in 1289. Some of these grants may have come from Nicholas Seagrave himself. Royal grants included the right to free warren at Penn in 1296 and at Alconbury in Huntingdonshire six years later.<br>
<br>In the general eyre of 1299&#150;1300 at Cambridge John Seagrave was required to answer to the <i>quo warranto</i> inquiries concerning his claim to hold view of frankpledge and the assize of bread and ale in Connington, Boxworth, and Fen Drayton. In 1300 he was given twelve oaks for timber from Cannock Forest, and ten oaks from Whittlewood Forest, for the construction of a chapel at Chalcombe Manor. In 1301 he paid &pound;800 for custody of the lands of his wife's father, Hugh de Plessis, together with the marriage of Hugh's heirs. In the same year he was given licence to crenellate his dwelling at Bretby in Derbyshire and, four years later, his manor at Calvedon. In 1305 Seagrave was also given permission to hold fairs and markets at Woodweston in Huntingdonshire, which was extended to his manor at Fenstanton in the same county in 1315, and to Aspel in Warwickshire in 1318. In September 1312 he was given the choice of lands to the value of &pound;100 yearly (for him and his heirs) or the grant of &pound;1000 to buy such lands. Four years later, in the survey known as the <span class="italic">Nomina villarum</span>, he was described as lord of Newbury, Berkshire, Connington, Boxworth, and Fen Drayton, Cambridgeshire, Repton, Derbyshire, Alconbury, Weston, Stanton, and Hilton, Huntingdonshire, Stottesdon, Shropshire, and Chalcombe, Northamptonshire. In 1318 Seagrave received the lands of his younger brother Henry, which through a reversion clause had passed to him on the latter's death. In 1323 he was allowed to alienate a messuage at Fenstanton near the parsonage there to allow the parson, Thomas Seagrave, and his successors to enlarge the house.<br>
<br>John Seagrave died some time before 4 October 1325. An account for funeral expenses was rendered by John Grey on 23 November 1325. He was buried at Chalcombe Priory. Christiana survived him, and was still alive in 1331. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25040/', "Nicholas Seagrave")</script> was also summoned as a peer from 1295 until his death in 1321, while another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25036/', "Gilbert Seagrave (d. 1316)")</script>, was bishop of London. John's eldest son, Stephen, who became the third baron, married Alice Arundel, but died some time before 12 December 1325, and was similarly buried at Chalcombe. His younger son and namesake married Juliana, daughter and heir of John Sandwich. The title was inherited by Stephen's ten-year-old son, John, whose wardship and marriage were entrusted to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27196/', "Thomas of Brotherton, earl of Norfolk")</script>. John in due course married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53070/', "Margaret Brotherton")</script>, the earl's daughter and sole heir, consolidating the family's status and territorial position, but died in 1353, leaving a daughter, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1338), who at the age of eleven married John (III) Mowbray (<i>d</i>. 1368).<br>
