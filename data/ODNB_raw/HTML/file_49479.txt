<span class="headword">Newbery,  Francis Henry <span class="st"> [Fra]</span></span>  (1855&#150;1946), <span class="occ">art educationist and painter</span>, was born on 15 May 1855 in Membury, Devon, the second son and third of the six children of William Newbery (<i>c</i>.1824&#150;1897), a shoemaker born in Stockland, Devon, and his wife, Mary Elliot (<i>c</i>.1820&#150;1888), of Bridport, Dorset. The family moved about 1858 to Bridport. Newbery attended Bridport general school from 1860 to 1874, where he qualified as a teacher. From 1871/2 to 1875 he studied at the Bridport School of Art, where he became a certificated art master. The same year he obtained a post as art master at the City Corporation Middle Class School, Cowper Street, London, then from 1877 to 1881 he taught at the Grocers' Company's School in Hackney Downs. Newbery enrolled as a general student at the National Art Training School at South Kensington in 1877, and in 1881 he won a scholarship as a full-time &#145;Art Master in Training&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1885 Newbery was appointed as headmaster of the Glasgow School of Art, where he established himself as a first-class pedagogue and organizer. His educational philosophy emphasized the importance of a thorough technical training, an immersion in artistic tradition, and the need for students to discover their own artistic individuality. He sought to employ artists as teachers, rather than the certificated art masters approved by the Department of Science and Art. Through the Glasgow School of Art Club, which he initiated in 1885, he encouraged a broader approach to art than that prescribed by the department's national course of instruction, and by 1897 Newbery's school was consistently gaining more awards in the department's annual national competitions than other schools of art.<br>
<br>In 1893 Newbery had taken advantage of additional funding made available through the <span class="roman">Technical Instruction Acts</span> (1887&#150;1892) and opened a series of craft workshops. His encouragement of collaboration between four students, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34764/', "Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868&#150;1928)")</script>, Herbert McNair (1868&#150;1953), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39323/', "Frances Macdonald (1873&#150;1921)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38964/', "Mackintosh, Margaret Macdonald")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38964/', "Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh (1864&#150;1933)")</script>, and his promotion of their and other students' work in British and continental exhibitions, won the school an international reputation. This was further aided by exposure of students' work in British and continental art periodicals such as <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, for which Newbery also wrote. His organization of the Scottish section at the international Exhibition of Modern Decorative Art at Turin (1902) gained Newbery the title of <i>cavalliere ufficiale dell'ordine della corona d'Italia</i>.<br>
<br>Newbery played a part in the selection of Charles Rennie Mackintosh as the architect of the Glasgow School of Art's new premises and between 1897 and 1909 collaborated closely with him over the details of its design and building.<br>
<br>In 1901 the Glasgow School of Art became the first central institution for art under the Scottish education department, with control over its own curriculum and increased funding, enabling Newbery to make prestigious international appointments to his staff. The teaching, especially that in architecture, was reorganized largely on the continental <i>beaux arts</i> model. Of the crafts which were taught in the school, probably the most distinctive was embroidery, carrying the Glasgow decorative art style well into the twentieth century. Newbery's school was unusual in employing large numbers of women, many of whom, like Newbery's wife, Jessie Wylie Rowat (1864&#150;1948) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/45805">Newbery,  Jessie Wylie</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/73660">Glasgow Girls</a>], whom he married on 28 September 1889, had previously been students.<br>
<br>As a painter Newbery was closely allied with the Glasgow Boys, with whom he exhibited internationally. Like several of them he often chose field workers and fishermen as subjects, as well as children&#151;primarily his two daughters, Margaret Elliot (<i>b</i>. 1890) and Mary Arbuckle (<i>b</i>. 1892). Many of his paintings were produced at Walberswick in Suffolk, which he visited from 1883 to 1915, including <span class="italic">Sole a levante e luna a ponente</span> (<i>c</i>.1901; Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Turin) and <span class="italic">The Warden of the Marshes</span> (<i>c</i>.1899; Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago, Chile). After his retirement in 1917 Newbery settled in Corfe Castle, Dorset, where he continued to paint until 1932. His most important late works were decorative schemes for Bridport town hall (1923&#150;7) and at the church of the Holy Ghost and St Edward, Swanage (1924&#150;30). Newbery died at his home, Eastgate, East Street, Corfe Castle, on 18 December 1946 and was buried there in the West Street cemetery. Examples of his paintings are held in the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, and the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, University of Glasgow.<br>
