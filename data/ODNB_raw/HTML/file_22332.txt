<span class="headword">Pitt,  Robert</span>  (1653&#150;1713), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Robert Pitt, was born at Blandford Forum, Dorset. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 2 April 1669, and was elected to a scholarship there in 1670. He graduated BA in 1672, was elected a fellow of his college in 1674, and graduated MA in 1675, BM in 1678, and DM on 16 February 1682. Pitt was professor of anatomy at Oxford, and was elected FRS on 20 December 1682. He published two papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>: the first, in 1691, was based on observations made between 1651 and 1657 by George Ent on the change in body weight of the land tortoise after hibernation, and the second, in 1694, was on convulsive rheumatic lumbago. In 1684 he settled in London, and was admitted a candidate or member of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December. He was created a fellow and admitted on 12 April 1687 by the controversial charter of James II, when some fellows were excluded and new ones admitted. He was a censor in 1687 and 1702. He lived in the parish of St Peter-le-Poer, in the City of London, from 1685 to 1703, when he moved to Hatton Garden. On the death of Francis Bernard he was, on 23 February 1698, elected physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital, and held office until 1707.<br>
<br>Pitt took an active part in the controversy which followed the establishment of a dispensary by the Royal College of Physicians to provide medicines for the sick poor. He was not a signatory to the instrument establishing the dispensary, although the records show that he was present at the meeting, on 22 December 1696, when the document was approved. He later became a leading advocate of the plan and is said to have joined the dispensarian faction of the college out of a desire to reform the practice of medicine. In 1702 he published <span class="italic">The Craft and Frauds of Physick Expos'd</span>, dedicated to the president and governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital. In the third edition, published in 1703, he added a lengthy preface attacking the apothecaries whom he accused of acting as unlicensed medical practitioners, favouring expensive worthless drugs and oppressing the sick with too many medicines. In his review of contemporary therapy he favoured indigenous drugs over the &#145;rarer Productions of both the Indies&#146; and condemned a number of items in the pharmacopoeia, including precious metals, precious stones, Bezoar stone, mummy, viper flesh, and some other drugs of animal origin. In 1704 he published <span class="italic">The antidote, or, The preservative of life and health and the restorative of physick to its sincerity and perfection</span>; in 1705 <span class="italic">The frauds and villanies of the common practice of physick demonstrated to be curable by the college dispensary</span>; and in 1707 a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The calamities of all the English in sickness</span>. Pitt was attacked by Joseph Browne in 1703 in a book entitled <span class="italic">The modern practice of physic vindicated, and the apothecaries clear'd from the groundless imputations of Dr Pitt</span>, and again in 1704, in an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">The censor-censur'd, or, The antidote examin'd where in the designs of Dr Pitt and the dispensary physicians are detected</span>.<br>
<br>Pitt married Martha, daughter of John Nourse, of Wood Eaton, Oxfordshire, in 1686, and died at home in Hatton Garden, London on 13 January 1713.<br>
