<span class="headword">Stringer,  Mabel Emily</span>  (1868&#150;1958), <span class="occ">golfer and journalist</span>, was born on 25 September 1868 at The Elms, New Romney, Kent, the eldest of the seven children of Henry Stringer (1838?&#150;1912), a solicitor, and his wife, Harriet, formerly Walker (<i>b</i>. 1845?). Her girlhood impression of the game to which she was to devote her life was that it was a &#145;particularly stupid&#146; and &#145;dull&#146; pursuit, which could not compare with her favoured pastimes of &#145;cricket, pole-jumping, bird-nesting, catapult-shooting, hunting, and the like!&#146;  (Stringer, 13). In 1887 a men's golf club was established at Littlestone, close to where she grew up, and on the links there she discovered her love for the game, playing alone in the afternoons with a cleek, a heavy mashie, and a putter. When Littlestone Ladies' Club was established in 1891 she became its first captain, a post she held until 1896.<br>
<br>The ladies' links at Littlestone consisted of nine holes right along the shore, facetiously dubbed the &#145;hen run&#146;, but they were seldom used as the women enjoyed unrestricted access to the men's links. The women were not, however, given similar access to the men's clubhouse, and had to make do with two empty rooms in an unoccupied coastguard cottage, onto which was tacked a tiny dressing-room of corrugated iron. This state of social apartheid was relaxed each Christmas, when there was a mixed foursome competition, after which the ladies were given tea in the men's clubhouse. The invitation, though, came on the strict understanding that the visitors were &#145;on no account to go in by the front entrance!&#146;  (Stringer, 14). Years later, when the conditions enjoyed by women golfers seemed luxurious by comparison, Stringer reflected nostalgically on the &#145;wretched little tin tabernacle&#146;  (ibid., 25) at Littlestone. But she felt no similar emotional attachment to the older style of dress, and wondered how women had managed to play at all in &#145;the outrageous garments&#146; decreed by Victorian and Edwardian fashion: &#145;The golfing girl of to-day should indeed be grateful that she need not play golf in a sailor hat, a high stiff collar, a voluminous skirt and petticoats, a motor-veil, or a wide skirt with leather binding&#146;  (ibid., 29).<br>
<br>In 1894 Littlestone was chosen as the venue for the second (British) ladies' championship and Stringer made her championship d&eacute;but on her home course. She subsequently entered every year, until illness forced her absence in 1901. She also missed the championships of 1904 and 1905, when she pursued employment as a lady's companion, but she competed in her final championship in 1907. Although she never advanced very far in championships, she was a first-rate golfer, and joint holder of the women's course record at Littlestone. Lung trouble denied her a place on the England team to face Scotland in 1902, but she represented her country in the international cup held that year.<br>
<br>The 1894 ladies' championship brought about Stringer's first meeting with Isette Pearson, a founder and honorary secretary of the Ladies' Golf Union (LGU). Pearson visited Littlestone in advance of the championship to view the course, and Stringer was asked to entertain her. A lifelong friendship began, which deepened Stringer's own involvement with the union. She represented Kent on its council for more than twenty years, and briefly deputized for Pearson when the latter was ill, serving as assistant honorary secretary. A great enthusiast for and instigator of county golf, Stringer was also involved in establishing a proper handicap system for women golfers, a regulated system that put the much looser male equivalent to shame and which she considered &#145;the greatest achievement&#146; of the LGU  (Stringer, 175).<br>
<br>Stringer had helped to produce the early yearbooks of the LGU, and in 1903 she was asked by a national newspaper to cover a tournament in place of its regular correspondent, who was ill. This was her start in golf journalism and being &#145;almost the only woman in this particular work&#146; she found regular employment. By the spring of 1906 she was making, by her own estimate, &#145;a fairly good living&#146; from writing, and decided to make it her profession. Thereafter she covered the important championships for the British and foreign press, writing for a range of publications from dailies to periodicals. Her reports were then more likely to be placed in the social columns of newspapers rather than on the sports pages, but by the time that she had retired in 1924 this had changed; she had played an important part in establishing women's golf as a recognized sport, with its own news value. Her descriptions of the major tournaments, and of those who played in them, stimulated public interest and encouraged new players. She was present at all the ladies' championships from 1908 to 1923, and witnessed the d&eacute;buts of many great golfers, notably Cecil Leitch at St Andrews in 1908. Stringer regarded the 1908 championship as &#145;the most epoch-making&#146; because of the venue:<blockquote>not only did our presence there indicate that any prejudices against women's intrusion on men's <i>rights</i> had been overcome, but the subsequent happenings of the week clearly showed that we had justified our right to play over the ground where other women had played three hundred years before. (Stringer, 164)</blockquote>In 1914 J. S. Wood, co-proprietor and chairman of <span class="italic">The Gentlewoman</span>, to which Stringer had long been a contributor, approached her with the idea of an English girls' golf championship. Together they organized a match-play event for sixteen qualifiers. The large number of entries for the inaugural championship that year was testimony to the potential of the event, though it had to be cancelled after the outbreak of war. When in 1919 Stringer became editor of the sports pages of <span class="italic">The Gentlewoman</span>, she revived the plan, and the first girls' championship was played that year at Stoke Poges, home of the event until 1938. The tournament was an immediate success, combining a friendly atmosphere with fine competition. Stringer was the driving force behind it, making sure that the organization ran smoothly and that the girls and their anxious relatives were kept happy.<br>
<br>It was Cecil Leitch who famously christened Stringer &#145;Auntie Mabel&#146;, and by mid-century Auntie Mabel was already &#145;a mythical person to the moderns&#146;  (Wilson, 108). A mentor to young players, those &#145;nieces&#146; to whom she dedicated her book of <span class="italic">Golfing Reminiscences</span> (1924), Stringer was closely involved in the founding of several important women's golfing societies, and on her retirement in 1924 seven associations raised a special collection of &pound;160 as a token of their esteem: she used the money to install electric lighting in her simple cottage in Kent. Many women had reason to be grateful for what she had achieved in her sixty years' involvement with the game of golf. A competitor in the second ladies' championship in 1894, she lived to witness the great home triumph in the ninth Curtis cup match at Prince's, Sandwich, in 1956. She never married, and died at her home, 26 Herschell Square, Walmer, Kent, on 10 February 1958.<br>
