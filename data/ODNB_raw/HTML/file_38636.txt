<span class="headword">Sully,  James</span>  (1842&#150;1923), <span class="occ">philosopher and psychologist</span>, was born on 3 March 1842 at Salmon Parade, Bridgwater, Somerset, the eldest son of the eight children of James Wood Sully, a liberal Baptist merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Eliza Fender. In 1859, having attended various dame-schools in Bridgwater and also Taunton School, Sully was baptized and joined the family business. Planning to become a Baptist minister he studied at Regent's Park College in London from 1863 to 1866. However, his religious feelings ebbed and instead of taking holy orders he went to G&ouml;ttingen, in Germany, to study under Lotze for an MA of the University of London; he was awarded the gold medal in 1868. Alexander Bain, who examined Sully, recommended him to John Morley as an assistant; in 1871, after a brief period as a classical tutor at the Baptist college in Pontypool, Sully became Morley's assistant at the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and tutor to his stepson. Contributing philosophical and psychological essays to the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, and to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (including an article entitled &#145;Evolution&#146;, written with Thomas Huxley), Sully gained an entr&eacute;e to &#145;the innermost circle of men of letters&#146;  (Sully, 135). Membership of the Savile Club also helped him to make literary and scientific acquaintances.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1871&#150;2 Sully studied physiology in Berlin with Helmholtz and Dubois-Reymond. Sully's first book, <span class="italic">Sensation and Intuition</span> (1874), was compiled from his psychological articles. Between 1871 and 1901 he published about fifty articles on music, illusions, childhood, laughter, and German culture in general interest periodicals; most of these were subsequently elaborated in books, including <span class="italic">Pessimism</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Illusions</span> for the <span class="roman">International Scientific Series</span> (1881), <span class="italic">Studies of Childhood</span> (1895), and <span class="italic">An Essay on Laughter</span> (1902). He contributed regularly to the journal <span class="italic">Mind</span>.<br>
<br>On 2 June 1870, at Pontypool, Sully married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1851/2), daughter of Thomas Lewis, grocer and draper; they had two children. Having left Pontypool the Sullys lived at Compton, not far from the Morleys, then in St John's Wood, near the Huxleys and Richard Garnett. In 1878 they settled in Hampstead; there Sully, who had suffered a nervous breakdown and bouts of insomnia in the previous five years, found refuge from the London noise, to which he devoted an article in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (1878) in a vain attempt to overcome his affliction through writing about it.<br>
<br>Until 1879 the Sully household relied mainly on an allowance from his father. After his father's bankruptcy, however, Sully, whose three applications for university chairs in philosophy proved unsuccessful, had to increase his journalistic output and to take on examining in philosophy for Cambridge University and Victoria University, Manchester, in addition to examining in logic and psychology for the University of London, which he began in 1878. He also started lecturing on the theory of education at the College of Preceptors and at the Maria Grey Training College. Having thus found a keen audience for his psychological researches he published three textbooks, which became set texts in British and American universities. Among the first systematic expositions of psychology in the English language his <span class="italic">Outlines of Psychology</span> (1884; new edn, 1892), <span class="italic">The Teacher's Handbook of Psychology</span> (1886; 5th edn, rewritten, 1909), and <span class="italic">The Human Mind</span> (1892) had a profound influence on the genre of the psychology textbook. In 1892 Sully was elected to the Grote chair of the philosophy of mind and logic at University College, London. In 1897 he was secretary to the organizing committee of the psychology laboratory but showed little interest in experimental work once the laboratory was established. W. H. R. Rivers came down from Cambridge to hold laboratory classes. Sully believed that experimental work was of limited relevance to the investigation of mental evolution and genetic psychology, on which he focused during the later years of his career.<br>
<br>Central to Sully's research was the study of children, which was facilitated by his involvement in the British Child Study Association, a federation of local child study societies comprising mainly teachers and parents, who keenly shared observations with Sully. Sully became &#145;the most influential figure in the Association, shaping its ideas and often presiding over its day-to-day business&#146;  (Wooldridge, 37). He held various offices in the London Child Study Society during the 1890s. Alongside teacher training, child study provided him with a context for defining the role of the professional psychologist in relation to amateur practitioners of the science, and for elaborating his views on the scientific method as a component of humanistic education. Sully's <span class="italic">Studies of Childhood</span> appeared in 1895. His writings on children drew on a wide range of sources and paid particular attention to children's early language and their games and fantasies  (Wooldridge, 39).<br>
<br>Having retired from his chair in 1903 Sully, who was a keen traveller, spent much time touring the continent. He scaled down his writing activity, publishing only travel sketches and memoirs, including autobiography (1918), after his retirement. He died at 6 Montague Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 1 November 1923.<br>
<br>According to Adrian Wooldridge, Sully's &#145;distinctive approach to children ensured that the [British Child Study] Association was something more than just a branch of the American child study movement, while his position in the academic world provided an invaluable link between a movement of interested amateurs and the emerging profession of psychology&#146;  (Wooldridge, 37).<br>
