</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collins,  Michael</span>  (1890&#150;1922), <span class="occ">Irish revolutionary and chairman of the provisional government of the Irish Free State</span>, was born on 16 October 1890 at Woodfield, co. Cork, the third son and youngest of eight children of Michael John Collins (1815&#150;1896) and Mary Anne O'Brien (1855&#150;1907), on the farm Michael senior had inherited from his father. Their holding was a substantial one, and his was an established and active family.<h2>
<a name="CivilservantandIrishVolunteer"></a>Civil servant and Irish Volunteer</h2>Michael's father's death left his mother in charge of the family, and it was she who set for him the goal of a Post Office position, a common ambition in west co. Cork. Already enrolled at the local national school&#151;under a determinedly nationalist teacher&#151;he was dispatched to nearby Clonakilty to be tutored for the Post Office exams. He was duly awarded a temporary boy clerkship in the Savings Bank, which he took up in July 1906.<br>
<br>Collins spent the next nine and a half years living with his sister Hannie in west London. He was studiously ambitious, and acquired a knowledge of accounting, but failed on several occasions to gain a permanent civil service post. In 1910 he took a job with an accounting firm, moving later to a stockbroker's office. In 1914 he moved on again, to the bills department of an American bank.<br>
<br>Collins moved in largely Irish circles, first among his fellow employees at the Post Office and then within the patriotic clubs and societies to which many of them belonged. His was a self-educated radicalism, but his political instincts were rooted at home: local policemen described the Collinses of Woodfield as &#145;brainy&#146;, &#145;disloyal&#146;, and &#145;dangerous&#146;  (Stewart, 41&#150;5). He joined the Gaelic League and studied Irish. He played hurling and football with a Gaelic Athletic Association club and became its secretary&#151;and subsequently the treasurer of the London board. He was a member of Sinn F&eacute;in by 1908; in 1909 he was sworn into the clandestine Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB); in 1914 he became an Irish Volunteer. In the same year, he was appointed treasurer of the IRB for southern England, and became privy to its plans for a rising in 1916. He also contemplated joining his brother Pat in Chicago. The introduction of conscription in Britain in January 1916 forced his hand. Although later accused of being merely a draft dodger, it was as a committed republican rebel that he relocated to Dublin in January 1916.<h2>
<a name="TheEasterrising"></a>The Easter rising</h2>Collins's reputation was that of a &#145;wild&#146; Corkman, fiercely attached to his native county and as high-spirited in all his other attachments and relations. Mick was quick-witted, humorous, gregarious, and tall and handsome&#151;attractive to men and women alike. He formed good friendships easily but was equally liable to fights and fits of temper; he was easy to bait. His relationships with men often had a bantering, competitive edge to them. With women he could sometimes be awkward, but also charming and confiding. His physical exuberance made him a keen sportsman, and occasionally a bully. He was a frequent and serious theatregoer, and had an omnivorous appetite for Irish, English, and American novels and poetry. These he could quote and discuss with relish.<br>
<br>As he had been in London, Collins was soon an insider in Dublin. He met most of the leaders of the coming insurrection and joined the influential Keating branch of the Gaelic League, already well endowed with Cork people and up-and-coming revolutionaries. When the delayed and crippled Easter rising finally began on 24 April he was an aide to Joseph Plunkett, its chief planner.<br>
<br>Collins spent the following week in the General Post Office, the nerve-centre of the rebellion, attending the tubercular Plunkett and generally making himself useful. He was cool under fire, but did not take part in the fighting. After the general surrender he was not considered dangerous enough to be court-martialled, and was instead sent to Stafford detention barracks. In late June he was transferred, with hundreds of other rebels, to a makeshift camp at Fron-goch in Wales.<br>
<br>It was here that Michael Collins began to break out of his orbit as a clerk, secretary, treasurer, and aide. He became a commanding presence, and a key organizer in the wearying struggle to resist British control. He assumed the <i>de facto</i> leadership of his fellow &#145;refugees&#146; from Britain and was elected head centre of the camp IRB. Other men were beginning to fall into orbit around him.<br>
<br>The Fron-goch prisoners were released on 23 December 1916 as a conciliatory gesture by the British government, one which they interpreted as a victory. They quickly began to make an enthusiastic impact on Irish politics in a series of successful by-elections, in which Collins took part. He had been dismayed by the &#145;much, much too careful&#146; opinions prevalent in Cork  (Coogan, 59). The 1917 canvasses in Roscommon and Longford showed the unprecedented electoral vulnerability of the dominant Irish party.<br>
<br>The rebellion had been arranged by IRB activists, prosecuted largely by a radical fraction of the Irish Volunteers, and officially and popularly identified with Sinn F&eacute;in. Only the IRB had been officially committed to revolutionary means and republican ends. Sinn F&eacute;in&#151;a tiny party&#151;was not involved at all, although some of its members were. British repression had dislocated all three organizations, but unexpected popularity now beckoned.<h2>
<a name="Republicanactivistandleader"></a>Republican activist and leader</h2>Collins was a central figure in the ensuing struggle to shape a new movement. He travelled widely, spoke frequently, and became an adept at the back-room arts of committee packing, delegate selection, and election rigging. His power base was his new position as secretary to the Irish National Aid Association, to which he was appointed in February. From here he funnelled American money to former prisoners and their dependants, and built up an unequalled network of contacts. In fact National Aid was an IRB front, and with his new job came a place on its supreme council. Harry Boland, another rising man and expert wire-puller, became his fast friend and partner in intrigue.<br>
<br>These young militants were working to create a truly revolutionary movement. At first they backed Count Plunkett as a radical alternative to Arthur Griffith's Sinn F&eacute;in. But Plunkett was eccentric and incompetent, and the name Sinn F&eacute;in now had extraordinary popular resonance, so the faction fighting shifted to the conditions of a proposed merger, culminating in the party's official relaunching at a national convention in October 1917. The brotherhood's preferred candidate, Eamon de Valera, was acclaimed as president but its machinery was overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the fast growing movement. In electoral combat with the forces of moderation Collins barely scraped onto the last available seat on the executive.<br>
<br>Collins was by this time a familiar figure among activists. He had shown his Fenian colours at the funeral of Thomas Ashe, the president of the IRB, who died on hunger strike in September. This was a paramilitary occasion with a huge public audience, climaxing with Collins's ominous declaration that &#145;Nothing additional remains to be said&#146; after the graveside volleys  (Beaslai, 1.166). His stage management helped make his name among the reorganizing volunteers. When their convention was held on the heels of Sinn F&eacute;in's, committed republicans were elected to key positions and Collins himself became director of organization.<br>
<br>In 1917 Collins was one of many previously unknown people to rise to prominence and responsibility. Although he was unique in being on the national executives of the IRB, the Irish Volunteers, and Sinn F&eacute;in, other men held a similar clutch of positions at lower levels. The events of 1918 allowed him to dominate all three.<br>
<br>The driving force behind Collins's ascendance (and that of his cause) was the threat of conscription, which was given legislative force in April 1918. This united the nationalist population behind Sinn F&eacute;in, with the volunteers as the first line of resistance. A headquarters staff had been set up in March, which added the job of adjutant-general to his portfolio. The British government compounded its mishandling of the Irish situation in May by deporting most of the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership, while leaving the military and radical wings of the movement intact. Collins had himself been arrested in early April. He was bailed out once the conscription crisis began, and managed to evade the May round-up. From then on he was on the run from the authorities.<br>
<br>Collins now assumed the role of organizer-in-chief, and quickly became known to militant volunteers as their man in Dublin: the man who could get things done. He covertly encouraged aspiring gunmen and took gun running in hand, using the British IRB as an arms pipeline. Harry Boland simultaneously took over much of the day-to-day control of Sinn F&eacute;in.<br>
<br>Collins also began his intelligence work at this time. Before the May arrests he was approached independently by two detectives&#151;one a well-placed confidential clerk&#151;who warned him of the impending round-up. Both continued to pass him information. Collins was able to recruit two more and eventually assembled a remarkable network of agents within Dublin Castle, the Post Office, prisons, and even military headquarters. For all its impressive apparatus of safe houses, codes, and operatives, however, the success of this &#145;secret service&#146; depended on its opponents' incompetence and lack of resources. Secret policemen and spies rarely posed much threat to Collins or the revolution.<h2>
<a name="MinisterforfinanceinthefirstDil"></a>Minister for finance in the first D&aacute;il</h2>Conscription was successfully deterred and, in the December 1918 general election, Sinn F&eacute;in won 73 of the 105 Irish seats. Collins was elected in South Cork, and he and Boland had personally chosen many of the other candidates. They would prove a reliable caucus for the coming revolution. Those not in prison assembled in Dublin in January 1919, declared themselves a sovereign parliament&#151;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&#151;and then declared independence. Collins was in Britain, arranging de Valera's dramatic escape from Lincoln gaol. Before sailing to the United States in May to raise support for the new republic, de Valera was elected president of the D&aacute;il and named a cabinet, including Collins as minister of finance.<br>
<br>It was as a minister that Collins achieved his greatest administrative triumph. The revolutionary government was to be financed by subscriptions to a D&aacute;il loan. Collins devised the scheme in the summer of 1919, organized a staff, offices, collection system, and camouflaged bank accounts, and managed the project closely. The fund was heavily oversubscribed and closed in September 1920 at more than &pound;370,000.<br>
<br>In 1919 Collins officially relinquished his previous volunteer responsibilities and assumed the title of director of intelligence, as well as that of president of the IRB. A group of gunmen under his personal control (&#145;the squad&#146;) began to assassinate pursuing detectives in July, in a campaign later extended to include intelligence officers, agents, and miscellaneous enemies of the revolution. Its culminating blow came on 21 November 1920&#151;bloody Sunday&#151;with the massacre of twelve British officers. These killings were as important for their symbolic as their counter-intelligence value, reflecting Collins's role as godfather to the militant underground within the volunteers who sought direct action against the wishes of many senior officers and the moderate majority in Sinn F&eacute;in. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) which emerged in 1920&#151;a fusion of the IRB and volunteers&#151;was led by these men. Collins did not plan or direct the subsequent guerrilla warfare, but the creation of this truly revolutionary institution&#151;for which he laboured so hard&#151;was one of his chief accomplishments, and his most ambiguous legacy.<br>
<br>Collins's life on the run became the stuff of legend in 1920 and 1921. His days were filled with work, carried out in numerous smoke-filled offices (he smoked up to fifty cigarettes a day, but was able to quit) secreted in houses and shops around Dublin. He cycled to his endless rendezvous with couriers, agents, guerrillas, and friends without disguises, bodyguards, or a gun. His correspondence, notable for its precision, was vast. Many of his opponents became obsessed with his capture, and several men who shared his name suffered or died as a result. His friends and admirers, to whom he was known as the Big Fellow, came to regard him as indispensable. Numerous newspaper stories depicted him as a figure of glamour and mystery, and his name became internationally well known.<h2>
<a name="TheAngloIrishtreaty"></a>The Anglo-Irish treaty</h2>When the struggle between the IRA and British forces ended in a truce on 11 July 1921 Collins was one of the two most powerful men in republican Ireland. De Valera, who had returned to Dublin in December 1920, was the undisputed leader of the movement, but Collins was the hero of the revolution. He had a wide network of personal loyalists, and both he and de Valera maintained coteries of devoted followers. This court politics grew almost inevitably polarized as Collins's enemies&#151;including Cathal Brugha, the minister of defence, and Austin Stack, the minister for home affairs&#151;gravitated together, and de Valera himself became suspicious of Collins's intentions.<br>
<br>It was thus a matter of great surprise that de Valera chose to send Collins as a member of the Irish delegation to the decisive peace conference in London while staying at home himself. The negotiators were divided from the start. Collins, a reluctant participant, lodged apart from the others, and he and Griffith were at frequent loggerheads with their more intransigent fellow travellers, as well as with de Valera, Brugha, and Stack in Dublin. The weeks of talks that followed their October arrival were often bitterly tense, compounded by Collins's and Griffith's secrecy in meeting separately with their counterparts in the British cabinet.<br>
<br>The treaty they eventually signed on 6 December, under Lloyd George's threat of immediate war, gave dominion status to southern Ireland, with the promise of boundary revisions to partitioned and protestant-dominated Northern Ireland. It passed the cabinet by one vote, with de Valera opposed, and was accepted by the D&aacute;il on 7 January 1922 by an almost equally slim margin. Having led the fight with considerable parliamentary skill, Collins became both chair and finance minister of the transitional provisional government. He would be its dominant personality and charismatic figurehead.<br>
<br>The treaty debate was also the occasion for Collins to announce his engagement. His fianc&eacute;e was Kitty Kiernan, whom he had met at the 1917 Longford by-election. Collins in turn found himself pursued by London and Dublin socialites&#151;most notably Lady Hazel Lavery&#151;whose attentions he returned with varying degrees of ardour. Whether any were physically consummated is unclear, although his romantic and sexual accomplishments were as subject to rumour and exaggeration as the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Collins spent the next seven months trying to hold together his new government, its relationship with Britain, and the republican movement. He defended the treaty as a writ of real sovereignty, and was closely involved in the transfer of power to the nascent free state. As always with Collins, however, conspiracies and schemes flowed beneath his official pronouncements and policies, and often in contrary directions. Thus, while he worked those parts of the treaty he liked, he attempted to subvert those he found troublesome. Public co-operation with Sir James Craig, the unionist premier of the separatist northern province, was matched with a covert campaign to make it ungovernable. In this he had the help of his opponents in breakaway IRA units, who otherwise accused him of undermining their own position with a rival army and police force.<br>
<br>The ultimate sleight of hand would be to give the free state a quasi-republican constitution, thereby assuaging Collins's critics and reassuring his more doctrinaire supporters. His attempt to reunite the sundering movement relied on this promise, and on power sharing deals made with various factions of opponents in May. Under a pact signed with de Valera, Sinn F&eacute;in would put forward a single slate of pro- and anti-treaty candidates in the June general election, on a platform of coalition government. Parallel talks within the divided IRA concluded that it would remain independent, with an agreed executive made up largely of IRB men.<h2>
<a name="Civilwarandmartyrdom"></a>Civil war and martyrdom</h2>Everything fell apart in June 1922. Collins's northern policy was a failure on all fronts. The British government angrily rejected the draft constitution. All anti-treatyites rejected the revised version. The IRA executive and convention rejected the proposed terms for army unity. His favourite instrument, the IRB, had broken in his hands, and most of his cabinet were hostile to his deal making and intrigues. And finally, the voters rejected the Sinn F&eacute;in pact in the 16 June election, and chose an overwhelming pro-treaty majority. Collins had lost his room to manoeuvre, but nevertheless retained his popularity&#151;&#145;what's good enough for Mick is good enough for me&#146; was a common refrain.<br>
<br>Collins played his last card when he agreed to a direct assault on the recalcitrant IRA executive in Dublin on 28 June. Urgency was required to pre-empt a threatened British intervention, and he hoped it would be an isolated action, leading to renewed negotiations. The Dublin fighting was soon over, but it proved to be only the beginning of civil war. Collins took charge as commander-in-chief in July. He sought a quick victory, and never lost hope of a quick peace by agreement. When Cork fell to the national army in August he sensed an opportunity for both, and returned home in triumph. On 22 August his convoy was ambushed as it travelled through B&eacute;al na mBl&aacute;th in west co. Cork. Collins took part in the fighting and was shot dead; despite numerous conspiracy theories, it was just bad luck. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, on 28 August, his funeral the occasion for mass grief.<br>
<br>Collins's reputation has been embalmed by youthful martyrdom. Many biographies and memoirs have been written; none has been seriously critical with the partial exception of Frank O'Connor's brilliant <span class="italic">The Big Fellow</span> (1937). Most embrace the theme of indispensability: his genius was necessary to the success of the revolution, and his loss permanently diminished Irish public life thereafter. After the IRA renewed its campaign in 1970 he was used by republicans as a symbol of revolution, and by their nationalist opponents as an exemplar of pragmatism over fanaticism. Neil Jordan's feature film <span class="italic">Michael Collins</span> (1996) ensured his status as a contemporary popular icon.<br>
