<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Joseph Shield</span>  (1850&#150;1927), <span class="occ">economist</span>, the only son of the Revd Thomas Nicholson, Independent minister at Banbury, and his wife, Mary Anne Grant, was born at Wrawby, Lincolnshire, on 9 November 1850. His education began at a preparatory school at Lewisham. After attending classes at King's College, London, he matriculated there in 1867, and gained his BA with high honours in 1870. From 1872 to 1873 he studied at Edinburgh University. In 1873 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first class in the moral sciences tripos in 1876. In 1877, the year of its institution, and again in 1880, Nicholson was awarded the Cobden (triennial) prize. The earlier of his prize essays, published in 1878 under the title of <span class="italic">The Effects of Machinery on Wages</span>, gained for him the Cambridge degree of ScD. In 1877 he was placed first in the London MA examination (philosophy branch) and obtained the Gerstenberg prize for special distinction in political economy. Subsequently, accompanied by his friend James George Frazer, he went to Heidelberg, where he attended lectures, chiefly on law, at the university.<br>
<br>From 1876 to 1880 Nicholson was a private tutor at Cambridge; he lectured on English history at Trinity College, and took an active part in the extra-mural teaching of the university. For two years (1878&#150;80) he lectured on political economy for the Association for the Higher Education of Women in Cambridge. In the early days of the Cambridge chess club (founded 1871) Nicholson was an outstanding player, and a member of the team which, in 1874, defeated Oxford for the first time. In later years he became widely known through the chess column of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a subtle composer and solver of chess problems. Nicholson was also devoted to boating and fishing, and he was an accomplished swimmer. His vacations at this period were usually spent in the north of Scotland, and his daring exploits in the seas around Cape Wrath and in the lochs of Sutherland became a tradition of the district.<br>
<br>In 1880, before he was thirty, Nicholson was elected to the chair of political economy and mercantile law at the University of Edinburgh. He arrived in Edinburgh from Cambridge with a reputation as a hard worker and as a teacher of great ability, who could expound economic principles with lucidity and bring them into close and intelligible relation with the problems of the day. This reputation he fully justified throughout the whole period of forty-five years during which he held the chair. As professor he maintained the highest Scottish traditions. His teachings and his writings played a definite and important part in the formation of public opinion. On questions of imperial economic policy and of currency and banking he attained a position of exceptional authority. In the difficult period of war finance his counsel and consistent teaching did much to keep depreciation of currency within remediable limits. There were few teachers of his time in Scotland who did more to bring academic life into touch with that of the community. He was the pioneer of economic history in Scotland, and during his professorship his department grew until it included nearly half as many teachers as there had originally been students.<br>
<br>Nicholson was fourteen years in writing his main work, <span class="italic">Principles of Economics</span>. Even when he started, the subject's growing complexity and specialization were making the general treatise a difficult achievement. P. H. Wicksteed's <span class="italic">Common Sense of Political Economy</span> (1910) excepted, Nicholson's was the last successful attempt to bring it off. The book also seemed old-fashioned by its omission of the marginal principle, which by then had come to dominate economics, at any rate at its academic leading edge. But its merits&#151;vitality, lucid style, and skilful interweaving of theory and historical evidence&#151;were immediately appreciated. To Nicholson himself, it was his political views, rather than his approach to economics, that were becoming obsolete. &#145;It is not pleasant&#146;, he told the Edinburgh chamber of commerce in 1893, &#145;for a man at my time of life to be accused of being reactionary, old-fashioned and fossilised.&#146; Nicholson was referring to his hostility to trade unions, which he considered just another form of monopoly: but his economic liberalism in general had faded from fashion as reformers devised ever more tasks for the state to perform. But, however uncomplicated his ideology and aggressive his defence of it, he was never an inflexible doctrinaire on practical questions of economic policy. Indeed his ability to present with equal pungency, if not equal conviction, both sides of a question make his <span class="italic">The Effect of Machinery on Wages</span> (1879), <span class="italic">Essays on Present Monetary Problems</span> (1888), <span class="italic">The Tariff Problem</span> (1903), and the policy-oriented sections of the <span class="italic">Principles</span> among the most worthwhile economic writing of the age. Only the later work, <span class="italic">Inflation</span> (1919), lapses into the empty rhetoric which disfigures much of his directly political writing. For the most part he was a conciliatory bimetallist, a moderate under-consumptionist, a pragmatic free-trader, and a subtle defender of the quantity theory of money.<br>
<br>No estimate of Nicholson's personality would be complete without a reference to his literary activities of a lighter kind. His romance <span class="italic">A Dreamer of Dreams</span> (1889) is very revealing as a human document, while the other two&#151;<span class="italic">Thoth</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">Toxar</span> (1890)&#151;in their allegorical undertones give many of his views on life and its problems. The link between these and his books on Ariosto&#151;<span class="italic">Tales from Ariosto</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">Life and Genius of Ariosto</span> (1914)&#151;is to be found in the position assigned to Ariosto as &#145;the father of modern romance&#146;.<br>
<br>Nicholson was an honorary LLD of the universities of St Andrews (1911) and Edinburgh (1916), FRSE (1884), FBA (1903), and medallist of the Statistical Society (1918). In 1885 he married Jeanie, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13448/', "William Ballantyne Hodgson")</script>, his predecessor in the chair of political economy at Edinburgh. They had one son (who died of wounds in the First World War) and two daughters. In 1925 Nicholson resigned his chair owing to an illness. He died at Edinburgh on 12 May 1927, following an operation.<br>
<br>Nicholson's likes and dislikes were never anything but transparent. A clear mind, a warm temperament, and a forceful style make him the most readable of the economists of his day. Even his devotion to Adam Smith is attractive, loyal but not uncritical, admiring but not unctuous. When Nicholson died, <span class="italic">The Times</span> wrote that &#145;he knew his <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span> as thoroughly as the Scottish peasant knows his <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and believed in it almost as thoroughly&#146;. Certainly, it would involve a long search to find a truer disciple of Adam Smith.<br>
