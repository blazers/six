<span class="headword">Cammell,  Charles</span>  (1810&#150;1879), <span class="occ">steelmaker</span>, was born on 8 January 1810 in Sculcoates, Hull, the fourth son of George Cammell, a shipmaster with Scottish connections, and his wife, Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1825). A self-made man, he was apprenticed to a local ironmonger before moving to Sheffield in 1830, where he joined the steel and tool firm of Ibbotson Brothers. Like John Brown, Cammell made his mark as a salesman&#151;a career in which he demonstrated great ability. A crisis in the American market, however, led Cammell in 1837 to start his own business, with the help of Thomas and Henry Johnson (the former the head bookkeeper from Ibbotsons). Johnson, Cammell &amp; Co., based in Furnival Street, made and merchanted tool steel and files, though by the 1840s the firm was becoming increasingly involved with the expanding market for heavy steel goods, such as railway materials. In 1845 Cammell moved his operations from the centre of Sheffield to the Don valley, where he erected the Cyclops works.<br>
<br>By 1855 Cammell's early partners had either died or retired and the company became Charles Cammell &amp; Co. However, from 1846 Cammell was helped by George Wilson (1829&#150;1885), a scientifically trained Scot, who was to become an important influence at the company. Under the two men&#151;Cammell the salesman and Wilson the works manager&#151;the firm expanded rapidly in the 1850s and 1860s, exploiting new tonnage steel technologies, especially the Bessemer process. Cammell followed John Brown's lead by installing Bessemer converters for steel rail production in 1861, with the firm supplying not only the British market, but also America, Canada, and South America.<br>
<br>In 1864&#151;in another parallel move to Brown&#151;Cammells became a limited liability company, with a paid-up capital of &pound;800,000. Charles Cammell (who was paid &pound;200,000 for the goodwill) became the chairman, with George Wilson as managing director. The company employed over 3000 workers and, alongside Browns, was the largest steelworks in Sheffield. It continued to grow through the 1870s, when such was the demand for rails that the Cammell steelworks, despite major plant extensions at Grimesthorpe, had difficulty in producing enough ingots to feed its mills. This demand, combined with orders for armour-plate&#151;which Cammells began rolling in 1863&#151;resulted in the company expanding outside Sheffield. Having already extended its Bessemer operations by taking over a works at Penistone, Cammells purchased the Oaks colliery in 1874 to gain access to the rich Barnsley coal seam. Charles Cammell and his board were also shareholders and directors in the Wilson&#150;Cammell Patent Wheel Company Ltd, built in 1873 at Dronfield to further exploit the market for steel rails.<br>
<br>To what extent was Cammell personally responsible for this success? According to one reporter, Cammell &#145;used often to say that Sheffield owed much to him&#146;&#151;though the same report quickly added that his success was &#145;almost as much due to those associated with him as to himself. He possessed in special degree the power of finding out those who could assist him in his work, and of attaching them to himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sheffield and Rotherham Independent</span>, 14 Jan 1879). Chief among these was George Wilson, the managing director between 1864 and 1885. Cammell was chairman until his death and usually attended board and annual company meetings; however, it is clear that after 1864 Wilson was the driving force.<br>
<br>Outside his business, Cammell was a gentrified industrialist. On 23 October 1845 he married a widow, Marianne Wright, daughter of Thomas Rollinson; they had six sons and one daughter. In 1851 he purchased the Norton Hall estate on the southern outskirts of Sheffield, and eventually became lord of the manor of Norton. He also owned the Brookfield Hall estate at Hathersage in Derbyshire and Ditcham Park in Hampshire. Although Cammell served as a JP and Conservative member of the Sheffield council, he eschewed public life and does not appear to have had any philanthropic interests.<br>
<br>Cammell died at 7 Southwick Crescent, London, on 12 January 1879 and was buried five days later at Hathersage church. He was survived by his wife. One of his sons, Bernard, later took a seat on the board of the Cammell company. In 1903 the company merged with the Birkenhead shipbuilders Laird Brothers to create Cammell Laird, based on the River Mersey.<br>
