<span class="headword">Conway,  Richard  Seymour-</span>, fourth marquess of Hertford  (1800&#150;1870), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born in London on 22 February 1800, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25184/', "Francis Charles Seymour-Conway, earl of Yarmouth and later third marquess of Hertford (1777&#150;1842)")</script>, courtier [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25167/', "Conway, Francis Ingram-Seymour, second marquess of Hertford")</script>], and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42344/', "Maria Emily Seymour-Conway, n&#233;e Fagnani (1770/71&#150;1856)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25167/', "Conway, Francis Ingram-Seymour, second marquess of Hertford")</script>], illegitimate daughter of the Marchesa Fagnani and (probably) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7937/', "William Douglas, fourth duke of Queensberry")</script>. He was known until 1822 by the courtesy title Viscount Beauchamp, and spent his early life in Paris. Although his father brought him to England in 1816, where he was tutored by (among others) the superintendent of the royal observatory at Kew, Stephen Demainbray, he often returned to Paris to visit his mother&#151;for example, as attach&eacute; to the British embassy in Paris in 1817 and 1819&#151;and his relationship with her remained the most important in his life.<br>
<br>Beauchamp matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 27 April 1818, but never graduated. In 1820 he bought a commission in the 10th hussars, transferring in 1823 as a captain to the 22nd light dragoons. Beauchamp's father succeeded to the marquessate in 1822, and Beauchamp advanced to the courtesy title of earl of Yarmouth. From 1822 to 1826 he was MP for co. Antrim. He travelled extensively in Europe during the 1820s, and it was as a young man that he was encouraged by his mother to buy gold snuff boxes, beginning his career as an art collector. In Paris in 1824 he entrusted his mother with his illegitimate son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28538/', "Richard Wallace (1818&#150;1890)")</script>, born following an affair with a Mrs Agnes Jackson, probably Eliza Agnes Wallace (1789&#150;1864), daughter of Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie (formerly Thomas Dunlop) and estranged wife of Samuel Bickley. He was first recorded buying pictures in 1827. In 1829 he was attach&eacute; to the British embassy in Constantinople, where he was greatly taken by the culture of the Ottoman empire. Also that year he acquired an apartment in Paris at 2 rue d'Artois, renamed in 1830 rue Laffitte, and in 1835 he bought the ch&acirc;teau of Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne, originally built in 1777 for the comte d'Artois, later Charles X. These purchases confirmed Paris as his principal residence; by the mid-1830s he was collecting art seriously.<br>
<br>The year before the purchase of Bagatelle, Yarmouth had met Louise Suzanne Br&eacute;art, daughter of a French professor and his English wife. Yarmouth appeared to have promised to marry Br&eacute;art, and eloped with her to London, where they went through a marriage ceremony performed by Yarmouth's valet dressed as a Church of England clergyman. Br&eacute;art did not discover that she was not really Yarmouth's wife for two months. She did not end the relationship at this point but instead remained faithful to her deceiver. She adopted the name Madame Oger, and one known child was born from the relationship, Seymourina Suzanne Vincent (<i>b</i>. 1846). Hertford had at least one more illegitimate child, Frederick, with a Miss Lucas.<br>
<br>On succeeding to the marquessate in 1842 Hertford (as he became) inherited an estate reputedly worth &pound;2,000,000 per annum. He had also by this time become one of the most active buyers and feared opponents in the art market. He was appointed KG in 1846, on the recommendation of Sir Robert Peel, but the honour was criticized in the London press because of Hertford's disengagement from public life and from his Irish estates around Lisburn, the source of much of his income, which he visited only once, in 1845. Contemporaries did however have the highest opinion of Hertford's abilities. Lady Blessington observed: &#145;He has great natural talent and knowledge of the world, but uses both to little purpose, save to laugh at its slaves. He might be any thing he chose, but he is too indolent for exertion&#146;  (Blessington, 1.118&#150;119), while Peel commented that &#145;if he had lived in London, instead of frittering his time away in Paris, he would no doubt have become Prime Minister of England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences and Recollections of Captain Gronow</span>, 327&#150;8).<br>
<br>Hertford rented 13 Berkeley Square for use as a London home from 1846, but used it rarely except for extended visits between 1848 and 1850. His largest London residence, Manchester House, was let until 1850 as the French embassy, but from 1852 was used principally to house items from Hertford's art collection. He never finished the refurbishment of another London residence, 105 Piccadilly, inherited from his grandfather the duke of Queensberry and intended by Hertford for his principal London house. In France he became a friend of the emperor Napoleon III and the empress Eug&eacute;nie, even agreeing to serve as chairman of one of the juries of the 1855 Universal Exhibition in Paris. Although not entirely free of the second empire's more lurid associations&#151;he was said to have paid the comtesse de Castiglione one million francs for one night of her favours, afterwards demanding a receipt  (Viel-Castel, 4.173)&#151;Hertford was more generally noted for the extreme simplicity of his household and dress. &#145;Very un-English in appearance, having inherited the sallow complexion and bright dark eyes of his Italian mother&#146;  (Rothschild), Hertford as he grew older became increasingly reclusive, especially after the death in 1856 of his beloved mother: &#145;He lived apart, invisibly, never received any guests, only opened his door to a few intimate friends and, totally indifferent to all movement and life, would not have drawn back his window curtain to see a revolution go past in the street&#146;  (Yriarte, &#145;Souvenirs&#146;). Hertford continued to add to his collections up until his death, increasingly relying on the advice of Richard Wallace, who often acted for him. He bought at many of the most spectacular sales of the period, including Stowe (1848), Pourtal&egrave;s-Gorgier (1865), and Demidoff (1863, 1868, and 1870). Hertford would pay immense prices when necessary, such as the 51,000 francs at the Pourtal&egrave;s-Gorgier sale for <span class="italic">The Laughing Cavalier</span> by the then almost unknown Frans Hals. Although he sometimes appeared in person at sales, he generally dealt through agents, notably the London dealer Samuel Moses Mawson (1793&#150;1862). Hertford lent generously to exhibitions, notably the 1857 Art Treasures exhibition in Manchester and the 1865 Mus&eacute;e R&eacute;trospectif in Paris. In 1857 Hertford declared that his &#145;collection is the result of my life&#146;  (Ingamells, 91) and in 1867 the art historian Th&eacute;ophile Thor&eacute; described him as the greatest collector in Europe  (B&uuml;rger, 1.537). According to the diary of Sir Henry Cole he apparently intended to leave his collections to the British nation but took no steps to do so.<br>
<br>Hertford demanded the highest standards in terms of quality, condition, and provenance. He favoured sensuous, attractive pictures judged by him to be &#145;pleasing&#146;, usually avoiding violent or overly serious subjects. He had little interest in the art of the Renaissance or the middle ages. Overall his old masters reflected traditional British aristocratic taste, with important groups of Dutch, Flemish, Italian, and Spanish seventeenth-century paintings. He was more innovative in his passion for French paintings of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, the sensuality and sophistication of which he especially appreciated. Hertford was an important figure in the nineteenth-century revival of interest in this art, assembling an unparalleled group of paintings by Boucher, including his masterpieces <span class="italic">The Setting of the Sun</span> and <span class="italic">The Rising of the Sun</span>, painted for Madame de Pompadour. He also acquired important pictures by Watteau, Lancret, Greuze, and Fragonard, whose celebrated <span class="italic">The Swing</span> he bought in 1865. His taste for the &#145;pleasing&#146; is also reflected in his collections of modern French and British painting, which include major works by Bonington, Delaroche, and Meissonier. He owned many orientalist pictures by such artists as Decamps and Horace Vernet and complemented these with an important collection of oriental arms and armour. Hertford also created extraordinary collections of French furniture, sculpture, and S&egrave;vres porcelain that, together with his French pictures, were to form the nucleus of the Wallace Collection, established in Manchester House after his death by Richard Wallace's widow.<br>
<br>Hertford, who throughout his life was given to hypochondria, was diagnosed with cancer of the bladder in 1860. After enduring his disease with fortitude he died at Bagatelle on 24 August 1870, one week before the French defeat at Sedan led to the end of the second empire. He was buried on 27 August in the Hertford vault in the cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise, his funeral procession having much difficulty crossing Paris because of the preparation of defences against the city's imminent siege. He was succeeded in the marquessate by a second cousin, Francis Hugh George Seymour (1812&#150;1884). He caused a bigger stir than he had ever done during his lifetime after his death, when he bequeathed the greater part of his unentailed property, including his art collections, to Richard Wallace, whom he never, even in his will, publicly acknowledged as his son.<br>
