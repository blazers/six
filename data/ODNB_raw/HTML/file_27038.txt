<span class="headword">Taylor,  James</span>  (1813&#150;1892), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church, civil servant, and historian</span>, was born in Greenlaw, Berwickshire, on 18 March 1813, the son of Alexander Taylor, farmer, and his wife Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pringle. From the parochial school of his native district he passed to the University of Edinburgh, and afterwards to the Divinity Hall of the United Secession church with a view to ordination. On 29 May 1839 he was ordained minister of the United Secession church in St Andrews. He graduated MA at Edinburgh University on 20 April 1843. His marriage to Mary Munro brought them at least two sons and a daughter, born between 1840 and 1845.<br>
<br>On 26 February 1846 Taylor was translated to Regent Place Church, Glasgow, and on 11 July 1848, with the greater portion of the members, he left for the new church erected in Renfield Street, Glasgow, where he ministered until 1872. From 1872 until 1885 he was secretary to the new education board for Scotland set up by the Liberal government in that year (the United Presbyterian church had been active in safeguarding its interests during the passing of the bill). Taylor oversaw the establishment of a national system of school boards for all except Episcopalians and Roman Catholics, a smoother and more comprehensive system than its English equivalent.<br>
<br>The rest of Taylor's days were spent in Edinburgh in literary work. Besides numerous articles in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, <span class="italic">Imperial Dictionary of Biography</span>, <span class="italic">United Presbyterian Magazine</span>, and individual sermons and pamphlets, Taylor published several works on Scotland, including <span class="italic">The Pictorial History of Scotland</span> (2 vols., 1852&#150;9; enlarged edn, 6 vols., 1884&#150;8), <span class="italic">The Scottish Covenanters</span> (1881), <span class="italic">Curling, the Ancient Scottish Game</span> (1884), <span class="italic">The Great Historic Families of Scotland</span> (2 vols., 1887), and <span class="italic">Lord Jeffrey and Craigcrook Castle</span> (1892). He also enlarged and continued Tytler's <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> (1845, 1851, 1863), abridged Kitto's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature</span> (1849), and edited <span class="italic">The Family History of England</span> (6 vols., 1870&#150;5). His <span class="italic">The Victorian Empire</span> (3 vols., 1897&#150;8) was published posthumously.<br>
<br>Taylor received the degrees of DD from St Andrews University in 1849 and of LLD from Edinburgh University in 1892. He was an effective preacher, a forcible debater, and a clear and accurate historian. Lord Beaconsfield, in his humorous mention in <span class="italic">Lothair</span> of the United Presbyterian church of Scotland as being founded in recent times by two Jesuits, made sarcastic reference to Taylor as one who had a wide knowledge of the statesmen and statecraft of his time and who urged his views on members of parliament and other leaders in church and state with unflagging pertinacity. Taylor died of heart disease at St John's, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, on 16 March 1892.<br>
