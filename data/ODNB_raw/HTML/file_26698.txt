<span class="headword">Stuart,  Charles</span>, Baron Stuart de Rothesay  (1779&#150;1845), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 2 January 1779, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26697/', "Sir Charles Stuart (1753&#150;1801)")</script> and his wife, Anne Louisa (1757&#150;1841), younger daughter of Lord Vere Bertie and his wife, Anne. His father was the fourth and favourite son of the prime minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute")</script>.<br>
<br>Stuart was educated at Eton College (1787&#150;95), Christ Church, Oxford (1797&#150;8), and the University of Glasgow (1798&#150;9); he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 November 1797 and may have read for the bar in 1800&#150;01. He entered the diplomatic service in 1801. Appointments as secretary of legation at Vienna (1801&#150;4) and secretary of embassy at St Petersburg (1804&#150;8) were followed by a liaison and intelligence-gathering assignment with the provincial juntas in French-occupied Spain (1808&#150;10). As minister at Lisbon (1810&#150;14) he made himself indispensable to Wellington, and he was made a member of the Portuguese regency council. During the &#145;hundred days&#146; (1815), he was ambassador at the courts of both the king of the Netherlands and Louis XVIII of France, who was in exile in Ghent. He was rewarded with a knighthood in 1812 and the GCB on 2 January 1815.<br>
<br>On 6 February 1816 Stuart married Lady Elizabeth Margaret (1789&#150;1867), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30248/', "Philip Yorke, third earl of Hardwicke")</script>. The marriage was one of convenience&#151;Sir Charles was reported by Lady Granville to have &#145;no thoughts of parting with a French actress whom he keeps&#146;  (Surtees, 95)&#151;but seems to have been happy none the less, and produced two remarkable daughters, Charlotte (1817&#150;1861), later Lady Canning [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42027/', "Canning, Charlotte")</script>], and Louisa Anne (1818&#150;1891), later Lady Waterford [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45749/', "Beresford, Louisa Anne")</script>], whose beauty belied their parentage, as both Sir Charles and Lady Stuart were plain.<br>
<br>In 1815 Stuart became ambassador at Paris, where he remained until 1824. His greatest diplomatic achievement was the treaty by which Brazil became independent of Portugal, negotiated on a joint Anglo-Portuguese special mission in 1825. He was reappointed as ambassador to France in 1828, and was created Baron Stuart de Rothesay of the Isle of Bute on 22 January that year. He was in Paris in 1830, at the time of the July revolution, and was rebuked by his government for not giving them sufficient warning. The foreign secretary, Lord Aberdeen, told him, &#145;This is a time when a little more exertion may reasonably be expected&#146;  (Aberdeen to Stuart, 31 July 1830; BL, Add. MSS). What Aberdeen meant by this was that he should keep them informed, but Stuart plunged into a frenzy of activity, which gravely embarrassed his government. Although instructed to maintain neutrality, he told the duke of Orl&eacute;ans (the future King Louis Philippe) that his claims were unlikely to be accepted by the great powers and became deeply involved in a plot to ensure that the succession passed to Charles X's grandson the duke of Bordeaux. When he learned of it the British prime minister, the duke of Wellington, was furious and pointed out that Britain might be accused of promoting civil war in France. Aberdeen did not, as Wellington wished, recall Stuart but warned him that he might be publicly disavowed. Stuart indignantly replied that he had suppressed all mention of the matter in his official dispatches and he presumed that his private letters were not liable to be &#145;brought forward&#146;  (Stuart to Aberdeen, 23 Aug 1830; BL, Add. MS 43085). The matter did not leak out and no trace remains in the Foreign Office files.<br>
<br>Paris was an important centre for collectors at this time, and Stuart made extensive purchases, sometimes also acting as agent for George IV. He built Highcliffe Castle at Christchurch, Hampshire, a rare example of the romantic and picturesque style of architecture, and furnished it with his Parisian acquisitions. The whig government removed Stuart from Paris in 1831 and he was not employed again until Sir Robert Peel's government sent him to St Petersburg in 1841. He was already a sick man. In April 1842 the Russian chancellor, Count Nesselrode, called him &#145;un cadavre ambulant&#146;  (W. Hamilton to earl of Aberdeen, 6 April 1842; BL, Add. MS 43142). In July 1843 he had a stroke, which left him unable to conduct business. He evidently suffered from what is now called cerebro-vascular disease. Although he tried to conceal his condition, his resignation was forced in March 1844. Stuart died at Highcliffe on 6 November 1845 from a series of strokes. He was buried a week later in St Mark's Church, Highcliffe, and his title became extinct.<br>
