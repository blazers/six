<span class="headword">Simpson,  Archibald</span>  (1790&#150;1847), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 4 May 1790 at 15 The Guestrow, Aberdeen, the fifth of five sons and the youngest of nine children of William Simpson (1740&#150;1804), clothier in Aberdeen, and his wife, Barbara (<i>c</i>.1750&#150;1801), eldest daughter of the Revd Francis Dauney, minister of Banchory Ternan. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and then briefly at Marischal College in 1803&#150;4. His maternal uncle William Dauney had been an architect in Aberdeen. He received his initial training in architecture from James Massie (<i>d</i>. 1816), an Aberdeen builder. In 1810 he moved to London and found employment with Robert Lugar and David Laing, for whom he prepared plans of a house in Aberdeen. His struggles in London, in spite of letters of introduction, are recorded in two letters to his family. In 1813 he returned to Aberdeen after a tour of Italy.<br>
<br>It was an opportune moment to return, because the citizens of Aberdeen had embarked on a series of ambitious street improvements at the same time as the technology had developed to enable the exploitation of the plentiful local granite for building purposes. Simpson was to emerge as the leading architect of the city, which he stocked with a fine series of public buildings, distinguished not only by his skill in seizing town-planning initiatives but also by the splendour imparted by their finely jointed and polished granite masonry. In these works he had to endure the rivalry of the city architect, John Smith (1781&#150;1852), who had the advantage of being longer established in their profession.<br>
<br>Simpson's first public building was the Gothic St Andrew's Chapel of 1816. His skill as a classical designer in the Greek revival style found expression in the Medico-Chirurgical Hall of 1818 and the porticoed county assembly rooms of 1820. These were followed by a wide range of commissions which display his inventive powers, including the Gothic Marischal College of 1837, the New Market of 1840, and in the same year his headquarters of the North of Scotland Bank, with its quadrant corner screen and richly decorated interior incorporating the Parthenon frieze. In 1843 he designed his celebrated &#145;triple kirks&#146; for three Free Church congregations whose financial constraint is reflected in their brick spires. Simpson also dominated architecture in the north-east of Scotland. He added to many existing houses and castles, but his finest design is probably Stracathro House, Forfarshire, of 1828 with its noble Corinthian portico. He also designed elegant classical villas such as Park House, Aberdeenshire, of 1822. St Giles's Church, with its portico and tower, is a powerful essay in the Greek revival style and provides the focal point at the heart of Elgin.<br>
<br>Simpson was of slight build and &#145;shy and retiring&#146; in character. He was remembered as &#145;a little, active man, always to be seen carrying plans under his arm&#146;. He loved music and played the violin. He died intestate on 23 March 1847 at his home, 1 East Craibstone Street, Aberdeen. He was unmarried. He was buried in the East Church of St Nicholas, Aberdeen.<br>
