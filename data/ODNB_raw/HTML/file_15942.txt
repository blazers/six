<span class="headword">Lambert, Sir  John</span>  (1815&#150;1892), <span class="occ">civil servant and musicologist</span>, was born on 4 February 1815 at Bridzor, near Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, the youngest surviving son of Daniel Lambert, a surgeon, of Hindon, and afterwards of Milford Hall, Salisbury, and his wife, Mary Muriel, the daughter of Charles Jinks of Oundle, Northamptonshire. He was a Roman Catholic, and in 1823 he entered St Gregory's College, Downside, near Bath. In 1831 he was articled to a Salisbury solicitor and he practised in Salisbury from 1836 to 1857. In 1838 he married Ellen Reade (<i>d</i>. 1891), the daughter of Henry Shorto of Salisbury. They had three sons and four daughters, of whom two sons and three daughters survived. Lambert took a leading part in local politics, and was a strong advocate of free trade; he was involved in anti-cornlaw agitation, and reformed the sanitary condition of the city. In 1854 he was elected mayor of Salisbury, the first Roman Catholic to be mayor of a cathedral city since the Reformation. In 1857 he was appointed a poor-law inspector.<br>
<br>In 1863 Lambert went to London at the request of C. P. Villiers, president of the poor-law board, to advise on the measures necessary to deal with the poverty caused by the American civil war, and the <span class="roman">Union Relief Acts</span> and <span class="roman">Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act</span> of that year were prepared as a result of his recommendations. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Public Works Act</span> Lambert superintended its administration. In 1865 he prepared statistics for the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Acts</span>, which were introduced in 1866 by Russell and Gladstone, and gave similar assistance to Disraeli in connection with the <span class="roman">Representation of the People Bill</span> of 1867. Before the resignation of Russell's administration he was offered the post of financial minister for the island of Jamaica, which he declined. In 1867 he drew up the scheme for the <span class="roman">Metropolitan Poor Act</span>, and under it was appointed receiver of the metropolitan common poor fund.<br>
<br>Lambert was a member of the parliamentary boundaries commission of 1867, and of the sanitary commission which sat for two or three years. In 1869 and 1870 he went to Ireland at Gladstone's request to gather information in connection with the Irish church and land bills, and prepared special reports for the cabinet. From 1871 to 1882 he was permanent secretary of the new Local Government Board, and was entrusted with the organization of the department. As a member of the sanitary commission he compiled in 1872 a summary of the sanitary laws, and in the same year he was chairman of the commission which drew up the census of landed proprietors in Great Britain. This was issued as a blue book, known as &#145;The Modern Domesday Book&#146;, and provided the raw material upon which John Bateman based his statistical compilation <span class="italic">The Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1876). In 1879 Lambert prepared a report for the select committee of the House of Lords on the conservancy of rivers, and also reorganized the audit staff of the Local Government Board. He was chairman of the boundaries commission of 1884&#150;5. In 1885 he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Lambert was a gifted musician, and was especially interested in medieval church music. He helped to revive the singing of plainchant, and at the end of his life was converted to the new theory of plainchant from the Solesmes congregation in France. He was a member of the Academy of St Cecilia at Rome, and received a gold medal from Pius IX for his services in promoting church music. His musical publications included <span class="italic">The Vesper Psalter</span> (1849), an edition of Janssen's <span class="italic">A Grammar of Ritual Music</span> (1849), <span class="italic">First Series of Hymns and Songs for the Use of Catholic Schools and Families</span> (1853), and <span class="italic">Dulcis Jesu memoria</span> (1856), a Gregorian hymn from the <span class="roman">Sarum Graduale</span> in modern notation. His works were widely used in Europe, especially in Belgium. Lambert was also the author of <span class="italic">Catholic Sacred Songs</span> (1853), <span class="italic">Modern Legislation as a Chapter in our History</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Vagrancy Laws and Vagrants</span> (1868). He was very fond of flowers, and published papers on the cultivation of orchids.<br>
<br>Lambert was made a KCB in 1879. He died on 27 January 1892 after a long illness, at his home, Milford House, Elms Road, Clapham Common, London, and was buried at St Osmund's Church, Salisbury, which he had founded.<br>
