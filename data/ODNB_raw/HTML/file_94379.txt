<span class="headword">Marshal,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1206), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18122/', "John Marshal (d. 1165)")</script> and his second wife, Sybil, sister of Patrick, earl of Salisbury. He was the youngest brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18126/', "William (I) Marshal, the future earl of Pembroke")</script> and <i>rector regis et regni</i>. The early course of Henry's life is obscure, and he seems to have owed his advancement primarily to his brother, beginning on 15 September 1189 when Richard I nominated him dean of York; he was consecrated subdeacon and deacon on the same day. Once at York he became involved in a bitter dispute with Archbishop Geoffrey, who excommunicated him early in 1190, but he was nevertheless active as dean, and also served as a royal justice. Henry remained at loggerheads with Geoffrey until early in 1194, when he secured further advancement, doubtless thanks again to his brother and also to Hubert Walter, who had preceded him as dean of York and was now both Richard I's regent and justiciar in England and archbishop of Canterbury. There had been a vacancy in the see of Exeter since the death of Bishop John the Chanter on 1 June 1191, caused largely by the king's absence on crusade and his captivity in Germany, and then, following his release, by his preoccupation with Normandy. Now Henry Marshal was nominated to Exeter by the autocratic king. Before 10 February 1194 he had been formally elected, and he was consecrated bishop at Canterbury by Archbishop Hubert by 30 March following. The appointment cannot have pleased Count John, who had been trying to act as his brother Richard's successor, for when he did become king in May 1199 the bishop had to pay him 300 marks for the confirmation of his charters, confirmation of the chaplaincy of Bosham, Sussex, and freedom of his demesne from tallage. Henry paid &pound;100 down and owed &pound;100 which he seems never to have paid. It looks as though he made his peace with the king; and he seems, indeed, to have been both very well connected and a friendly person.<br>
<br>It is true that Bishop Henry did not care much for his predecessor's favourites. He received authority from Celestine III (<i>d</i>. 1198) to recover those leases of the cathedral's properties made by canons without the consent of the chapter as a whole. But he seems to have been a great benefactor of the cathedral church and generous to the canons. He was remembered for his gifts of vestments and ornaments; he settled a jurisdictional dispute between the archdeacon of Exeter and the canons in the latter's favour; and he patronized a number of men who were to hold high office under his successors, including three future archdeacons and the first chancellor. He was closely connected with William Brewer, who in 1196 founded a Premonstratensian abbey at Torre Mohun, near Paignton, and in 1201 a Cistercian abbey at Dunkeswell. It is thought that he himself completed the building of his cathedral church, and he required every householder to contribute to it annually at least &frac12;<i>d</i>. at Pentecost. He also had churches built on distant episcopal estates, at Horsley (Surrey) and Westminster. In 1202 he took action against the sons of clerics who in breach of canon law were intruding themselves into benefices held by their fathers. He is credited with glossing the Pauline epistles. He died on 26 October 1206 and was buried in the cathedral, where his tomb, surmounted by his effigy, survives. Hooker, with much justification, considered him a good man.<br>
