<span class="headword">Landells,  Ebenezer</span>  (1808&#150;1860), <span class="occ">wood-engraver, illustrator, and magazine proprietor</span>, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne on 13 April 1808 and was baptized there on 15 May, the third son of Ebenezer Landells, a merchant, and his wife, Jane Graham. His paternal grandfather ran a wholesale drapery business and his maternal grandfather was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11226/', "Revd William Graham (1737&#150;1801)")</script>, minister of the Close Presbyterian Meeting-House. Landells attended Mr Bruce's academy in Newcastle and at fourteen was apprenticed to Thomas Bewick, the celebrated wood-engraver. After payment to Bewick of 5<i>s</i>. for indentures at the end of 1822 there is no further mention of Landells in Bewick's records. Landells served out his remaining apprenticeship with Isaac Nicholson, wood-engraver and himself a former pupil of Thomas Bewick. Nicholson's workshop was in St Nicholas's Churchyard, Newcastle. While an apprentice in 1826 and 1827 Landells exhibited paintings at the Northumberland Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts, Newcastle, and at the Northern Academy, Newcastle, in 1828.<br>
<br>On arriving in London in 1829, through the influence of fellow Northumbrian engravers John Jackson and William Harvey, Landells secured a position overseeing the fine art engraving department of Branston and Vizetelly. Landells engraved Harvey's drawings and initial letters for the second series of Northcote's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1833) and also drawings by H. K. Browne and Cattermole for Dickens's <span class="italic">Master Humphrey's Clock</span>, which were engraved in partnership with Charles Gray. He was married on 9 January 1832 at St Pancras New Church, London, to Anne, eldest daughter of Robert McLagan of London.<br>
<br>Landells earned a place at the heart of the burgeoning wood-engraving business in London as a result of his Newcastle connections, all talented pupils of Bewick. This skill was vital for providing illustrations for books and magazines for the mass market. Landells possessed great energy and enthusiasm and he had the vision to realize the potential of wood-engraving in this field. Unfortunately his lack of business acumen meant that his schemes were not always profitable.<br>
<br>Landells soon established his own engraving workshop and employed some of the most outstanding engravers and illustrators of the next generation, including Edward and George Dalziel, Birket Foster, and Edmund Evans. His first engraving business was run from his home in Thornhill Road, Barnsbury, in north London, where he was assisted by his brother Alexander. This was followed by a bigger workshop at 22 Bidborough Street, New Road, St Pancras, where he undertook the engravings for his own venture: a journal of fashion entitled <span class="italic">Cosmorama</span>. This was short-lived, as Landells soon became involved with journalists including Henry Mayhew, Douglas Jerrold, and Thackeray, all of whom had failed satirical magazines behind them. Landells devised a new model based upon the French magazine <span class="italic">Le Charivari</span> and provided the technical expertise and capital to produce a magazine with many small illustrations and two full-page wood-engravings. The cover was designed by Landells and executed by Archibald Henning and the political &#145;cut&#146; would change every week. The first issue of <span class="italic">Punch, or, the London Charivari</span> appeared on 17 July 1841. This involved a prodigious amount of work and organization by Landells, in particular liaison between illustrators, engravers, and printers. He was so successful in this respect that Herbert Ingram consulted him about launching his new paper, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, in 1842. Landells had a one-third share in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, but the magazine's initial fortunes were rocky, despite spectacular sales from almanack and holiday numbers. The printers and publishers Bradbury and Evans bought out the existing shareholders on 24 December 1842 and in spite of their promising to honour Landells's position as engraving chief he was soon replaced by Joseph Swain. Landells was able to vent some spleen against Bradbury and Evans in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Word with Punch</span> (1847), produced by Alfred Bunn, a theatrical impresario who had been lampooned mercilessly by the magazine; Landells provided the engravings for the diatribe in the <span class="italic">Punch</span> style.<br>
<br>Landells did not remain disaffected for long. His association with Herbert Ingram bore fruit and propelled Landells forward as an illustrator as well as an engraver. He was commissioned to make sketches of Queen Victoria's first visit to Scotland in 1842 for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. These were so successful that the queen bought the sketches and commissioned some additional watercolours while on her tour. Landells was the paper's first artist correspondent and later accompanied the queen on her visit to the Rhine. His workshop was also responsible for a large number of stock engravings for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>.<br>
<br>Landells was involved with many other magazines as proprietor or engraver: the <span class="italic">Illuminated Magazine</span> (1843), the <span class="italic">Lady's Newspaper</span> (1847) (&#145;the earliest paper devoted to female interests&#146;, according to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>), the <span class="italic">Great Gun</span> (1844), <span class="italic">Diogenes</span> (1853), and the <span class="italic">Illustrated Inventor</span>. He had a knack of identifying trends in publishing: seeing the growth in the children's book market, he illustrated his own&#151;<span class="italic">Boy's Own Toy-Maker</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Girl's Own Toy-Maker</span> (1859), and the <span class="italic">Illustrated Paper Model Maker</span> (1860). Landells undertook an enormous number of engraving projects with variable financial returns. Some of his early engraving work is quite fine, in the Bewick style, but his later work is undistinguished and merely competent. He was an exceptional teacher and encouraged his apprentices to develop their own particular strengths in drawing or engraving: Foster, Evans, and the Dalziel brothers were among those who loyally testified to this. His apprentices bestowed on him the affectionate nickname Tooch-it-oop, in imitation of his north-eastern accent, which he never lost  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Landells made a unique contribution to the development of the illustrated magazine in the nineteenth century. He provided the link between Bewick's inspirational use of wood-engraving for artistic purposes and the use of the same technology for the mass market. He exhibited engravings at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in 1833 and 1837. Over 1000 of his wood-engraving proofs are held in the prints and drawings department of the British Museum. He died on 1 October 1860 at his lodgings in Victoria Grove, West Brompton, and was survived by his wife, two sons, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Landells's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_15972"></a><span class="headword">Robert Thomas Landells</span>  (1833&#150;1877), <span class="occ">illustrator and journalist</span>, was born in London on 1 August 1833. He was educated in France but studied drawing and painting in London. He began his career as special artist at the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> in 1855, following his father, and in 1856 was sent to the theatre of war in the Crimea. Some of his sketches appeared in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> towards the end of the war. After the peace with Russia he went to Moscow to record the coronation of Tsar Alexander II for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. In winter 1863 he made drawings of the war between Prussia and Denmark and was decorated by both sides. He showed great skill in depicting battle scenes and troop configurations. In the war between Austria and Prussia in 1866 he accompanied the 1st Prussian army corps as part of the staff of the Prussian crown prince on the march to Vienna. He received the Prussian Iron Cross for bravery during the Franco-Prussian War in recognition of his exertions in aid of the sick and wounded soldiers in the winter campaign on the Loire. After this he did not undertake further foreign assignments, but concentrated on painting studies of the Thames and the Dutch coast. He was commissioned by Queen Victoria to sketch and paint state ceremonies and visits between 1857 and 1874; specimens of his work are preserved in the Royal Collection.<br>
<br>Robert Landells was married, on 19 March 1857, at St Pancras New Church, London, to Elizabeth Ann, youngest daughter of George Herbert Rodwell, musician and composer, and granddaughter of Liston, the comic actor. They had two sons and two daughters. Landells died on 6 January 1877 at his home, 49 Winchester Terrace, Chelsea, London.<br>
