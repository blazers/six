<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Conway,  Henry Seymour</span>  (1719&#150;1795), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 21 July 1719, probably at Lindsey House, Chelsea, Middlesex, the second son of Francis Seymour Conway, first Baron Conway of Ragley (1679&#150;1732), and his third wife, Charlotte (<i>c</i>.1683&#150;1734), the younger daughter of John and Elizabeth Shorter of Bybrook, Kent. His mother's sister Catherine was the wife of Sir Robert Walpole.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Conway entered Eton College in 1732. His cousins Edward and Horace Walpole also attended Eton at this time, and with the latter he maintained a lifelong friendship and correspondence. Their letters reveal a strong emotional interdependence: Walpole was Conway's chief or only confidant in his youth. His confession in 1737 that a vulgar expression by Lady Caroline Fitzroy, with whom he was in love, provoked &#145;a strong garrison of anti-venerial thoughts&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.3), followed by an account of his attending a masquerade dressed as a woman, has been interpreted as evidence of Conway's sexual ambiguity, supporting the proposition that his relationship with Walpole had a sexual element&#151;something insinuated by contemporaries later in Conway's career.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1737 Conway was commissioned lieutenant in the 5th dragoons. His military duties were not yet so arduous as to prevent his joining Walpole and Thomas Gray on their tour of Europe between May and October 1739, though he remained in Geneva while they proceeded to Italy. He found Geneva society tedious and by February 1740 had returned to Paris, where he related to Walpole his promotion to captain-lieutenant in the 8th dragoons: &#145;I am a-going over to fight like a <i>tigre</i>&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.45). Nevertheless, that year his attention was taken by a visit to the Conway family estates in co. Antrim, in preparation for his unopposed election as member for that county in the Irish parliament, which formally took place on 19 October 1741. In May 1741 (formally dated 14 February 1741) he joined the 1st foot guards as captain-lieutenant, a rank equivalent to lieutenant-colonel in the army, and that summer he studied drawing and mathematics under private tutors.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1741 Conway's long parliamentary career began when he was returned as MP for Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, by Thomas Watson-Wentworth, first earl of Malton, on the recommendation of Sir Robert Walpole. Horace Walpole later wrote that Conway, &#145;having set out upon a plan of fashionable virtue&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George II</span>, 1.27), had voted against the government in 1742 on army supply and alienated George II and William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, but there seems to be no other evidence for this. In July 1742 Conway joined his brigade of guards as part of the so-called pragmatic army assembled for the defence of the Netherlands. The nearest his regiment came to action was in the battle of Dettingen on 27 June 1743, but here the guards formed the rearguard and missed the fighting. Writing to his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6121/', "Francis Seymour-Conway, second Baron Conway and later earl and marquess of Hertford")</script>, he complained: &#145;You can't imagine how terrible it was not to be engaged &hellip; and been put always upon what is called the post of honour&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.138).<br>
<br>Conway attended the parliamentary sessions during the autumn and winter. Along with other army officers who were also members of parliament he returned to campaign in the Netherlands in May 1744. In that year he served as aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief, Field Marshal George Wade. His romantic attachment to Lady Caroline Fitzroy had been renewed about 1741, but in 1744 he concluded that his lack of means made a marriage impossible. Walpole, who had in any case strongly opposed the match, was willing to bestow a large portion of his own income, mostly from government offices, on his friend. He reasoned: &#145;If I ever felt much for anything &hellip; it was certainly for my mother. I look upon you as my nearest relation to her, and I think I can never do enough to show my gratitude and affection to her&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.170). Conway felt unable to accept this too generous offer. During the following year's campaigning Conway (who was now aide-de-camp to Prince William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, the new commander-in-chief) returned to Flanders just in time to take part in the battle of Fontenoy on 30 April 1745. He distinguished himself in the battle where only twenty-four of his company survived, and reportedly engaged single-handedly with two French grenadiers.<br>
<br>Conway left Flanders in October 1745, when he was recalled as part of the force intended to combat the Jacobite rising. He spent the winter of 1745 and spring of the following year in pursuit of Charles Edward Stuart's forces in northern England and Scotland. On 15 April 1746 he was gazetted colonel of the 48th foot, and on 16 April he fought in the battle of Culloden. Conway remained in Scotland, gathering intelligence reports and writing verses, until he returned to Westminster in November for the parliamentary session.<br>
<br>In spring 1747 Conway returned to the Netherlands. On 1 July, while on active service, he was re-elected to the Commons, this time for Penryn in Cornwall, in the interest of Hugh Boscawen, second Viscount Falmouth, a supporter of the Pelham ministry. He fought at Laffeldt on 2 July, where he narrowly escaped death, and was taken prisoner by the French, but was released on parole after three days. Conway was able to return to England in November, and on 19 December, at Somerset House chapel, Westminster, he married Caroline Bruce, countess of Ailesbury (1721&#150;1803), the daughter of Lieutenant-General John Campbell, later fourth duke of Argyll, and the widow of Charles Bruce, third earl of Ailesbury. Lady Ailesbury (as she continued to be known) had one daughter from her first marriage, Lady Mary Bruce (1740&#150;1796), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16451/', "Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond")</script>. Conway and his wife had one child, Anne (1749&#150;1828) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7084/', "Damer, Anne Seymour")</script>]. The summer following his marriage Conway leased Latimers, in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, a sixteenth-century house owned by the Cavendish family but disliked by Horace Walpole: &#145;Old but of a bad age&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.102).<br>
<br>Conway had been transferred from the 48th foot to the 34th foot in 1749 and in July 1751 went to join his regiment on Minorca, which failed to impress him: &#145;The country is one entire heap of rock and sand; not a tree for shelter nor a brook for refreshment in the whole island&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.310). He was anxious to escape and lobbied Cumberland for a new regiment, eventually receiving the 13th dragoons on 21 December 1751.<br>
<br>After visiting Florence, where he met Horace Walpole's correspondent Horace Mann, he travelled to Rome, then returned to England in February or March 1752, when he purchased Park Place, at Remenham, near Henley-on-Thames, from Augusta, princess dowager of Wales. Shortly afterwards Conway and his wife followed his regiment to co. Sligo, leaving their daughter to be cared for by Walpole. They also spent part of 1753 in Sligo, when Walpole kept his friend informed of the <span class="roman">Marriage Bill</span> passing through parliament. Conway, who professed a &#145;philosophical&#146; indifference to politics, and seems at the time to have been happy with his family cultivating Park Place, on returning home in June 1753 claimed puzzlement at the heat generated in the passage of the legislation:<blockquote>I don't clearly understand but I must own myself and very honestly do a miserable politician &hellip; and it's so much the nature of Englishness to divide and subdivide that if there were but two left in the world I believe they'd form two parties and if there was but one he'd quarrel with himself. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.367)</blockquote>He again visited his regiment in Ireland, now at Athlone, co. Westmeath, in May 1754.<br>
<br>Conway regarded his Irish connections as burdensome, but it was Ireland that would invigorate his political career. The 1754 election saw him returned for St Mawes, Cornwall, again by Lord Falmouth. In May 1755 he was unexpectedly named as chief secretary for Ireland by the new lord lieutenant, William Cavendish, marquess of Hartington (fourth duke of Devonshire from December 1755), probably at Cumberland's suggestion. He finally took his seat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for co. Antrim on 17 October 1755. Conway's relaxed temperament was expected to assist Hartington settle the political dispute between the speaker of the Irish Commons, Henry Boyle, on one hand, and George Stone, archbishop of Armagh, and the Ponsonby family, on the other. This had bedevilled Irish politics for several years, and had reached a crisis when in 1753 Boyle and many of his leading supporters had voted with the opposition against the government over the issue of the principle of royal consent being required for a bill apportioning a surplus in the Treasury to the payment of the national debt. Boyle and his allies had been removed from their offices and replaced by allies of Stone and the Ponsonbys. Hartington was a relative of the Ponsonbys but was also closely associated with James Fitzgerald, twentieth earl of Kildare, one of Boyle's most vociferous allies. Conway conducted negotiations on Devonshire's behalf and reported their progress to the government in Westminster. In a letter to the prime minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, Conway carefully expressed the settlement agreed between the parties on the question of the address to the king at the opening of the 1755 parliamentary session, and probably helped make it acceptable to the ministry. Newcastle wrote that he entirely depended upon Conway's &#145;good sense and integrity&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.404). Negotiations continued into early 1756, when Boyle was bought off with an earldom, Stone excluded from the list of lords justices, and Ponsonby made speaker of the Commons. Conway declared &#145;that the government was once more vested in the hands of the governor&#146;  (McCracken, 178), but the undertaker system survived until the Townshend lieutenancy of 1767&#150;72. Conway was promoted major-general on 30 January and returned to England in May. He remained an Irish MP until 1761.<h2>
<a name="TheRochefortexpeditionanditsaftermath"></a>The Rochefort expedition and its aftermath</h2>Conway was appointed in April 1757 a groom of the bedchamber, a position he had long sought. He spent much of his time after his return from Ireland in semi-retirement at Park Place, but in June he was returned to active service. Initially stationed at Bradford Peverell, near Blandford, Dorset, in July he was appointed deputy military commander of the proposed expedition to raid the French fort of Rochefort. Conway, like his superior Sir John Mordaunt, expressed doubts about the operation and probably remained sceptical of a successful outcome.<br>
<br>The naval force and troop transports after some delay set sail from the Isle of Wight on 6 September and reached the Basque Roads on 21 September. Here after further delays only the small Isle d'Aix was captured. A council of war was called on 25 September, where the senior officers of both the army and the navy decided that a direct attack on Rochefort could not succeed. Conway repeatedly advocated an attack on Fort Fouras, but his colleagues would only support a night attack, and when this was cancelled he was unwilling to take sole responsibility for a day assault. No further incursions were proposed and the fleet sailed for home on 1 October, arriving at Portsmouth on 6 October. In a letter to his brother, Conway wrote, &#145;These strange resolutions and irresolutions are endless and impossible and improper to relate&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.508), and later, &#145;I expect my share of blame; and for the only time of my life dread to come back to England&#146;  (ibid.). Conway gave evidence at Mordaunt's court martial; Mordaunt was eventually acquitted, but the affair badly damaged the reputations of both men, and Conway was made to feel the king's displeasure at court. When George II was presented with a list of the proposed staff officers for the 1758 campaign, the king struck out the names of Mordaunt, Conway, and the third in command at Rochefort, Edward Cornwallis. When the commander-in-chief, Jean Louis Ligonier, pointed out that Conway had tried to take action the king replied, &#145;Yes &hellip; apr&egrave;s d&icirc;ner la moutarde&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George II</span>, 3.5), and said he would think of Conway, but not then. In spite of this, Conway's efforts to join the expedition to St Malo or that to the West Indies in November 1758 were unsuccessful. He remained militarily inactive (although he continued to attend the Commons) until sent, at Ligonier's behest, to sign a cartel for an exchange of prisoners at Sluys on 6 February 1759.<br>
<br>Soon after the accession of George III in October 1760, Conway twice wrote to John Stuart, third earl of Bute, the king's mentor, to remind the new king of his &#145;desire for military employment&#146;. He wrote to Bute again in February 1761 asking him to intercede so that he could &#145;throw himself at His Majesty's feet if he has given any intentional offence&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 1.xxxvi). At last, at the end of March 1761, Conway was sent to Germany as deputy to John Manners, marquess of Granby, commander of the British forces in the allied army led by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the battle of Vellinghausen on 15&#150;16 July, Conway's corps, entrusted to him by Ferdinand, were placed in the centre of the allied line but were not attacked. During Granby's absence Conway became acting commander of the British forces in winter 1761&#150;2. He was present at the battle of Wilhelmstal on 24 June 1762 and in the following month captured the castle at Waldeck, which surrendered on 11 July, Conway exclaiming: &#145;it cost me two days but the French don't shine at these defences &hellip; they let me frighten them out by marching up with scaling ladders when my ammunition was out&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 38.163).<br>
<br>Following the signing of the peace preliminaries at Fontainebleau in November 1762, Conway was responsible for the embarkation of British forces in Europe. Some weeks before returning to England on 31 March he learned from his brother that Bute had apologized to the French concerning his management of the embarkation. Conway believed that Bute had acted thus because some of his army friends had voted in parliament against the peace, and he became convinced that Bute saw no role for him on the peacetime establishment. As a result Conway had informed Hertford that he did not intend to deserve favour by his own parliamentary conduct. This could be considered predictable: Conway's friends Walpole and Augustus Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton, were in opposition, as were most of his other connections. Grafton was the nephew of Lady Caroline Fitzroy and of Conway's sister-in-law Isabella Hertford, and returned Conway for Thetford at the 1761 election. When the parliamentary session opened Conway voted (on 15 and 23 November) against the new prime minister, George Grenville, to hear a complaint by John Wilkes that his arrest by general warrant breached his privilege as an MP. Then on 16 and 18 February Conway spoke and voted against the use of general warrants. The king insisted that as a consequence of his actions Conway should be deprived of his posts of groom of the bedchamber and colonel of the 1st dragoons. Attempts were made by Grenville himself and Walpole to mitigate the punishment. Conway thought he would lose only the civil post. The bedchamber, although prestigious, carried a relatively small salary, and the colonelcy constituted his principal income. In April 1764, following the prorogation of parliament, his dismissal was made public. Walpole at once wrote offering him &pound;6000, and there was also an offer of &pound;1000 from the duke of Devonshire. Although his income was now reduced from some &pound;6000 per annum to &pound;2000, Conway decided that retrenchment was preferable and declined the offers. When Devonshire died later that year Conway was left &pound;5000 &#145;as a testimony of my friendship for him and of my sense of his honourable conduct and friendship for me&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>, 16 Oct 1764, 363).<br>
<br>Conway's dismissal became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. The government, stung by Walpole's remark at an opposition dinner that Conway's case indicated that ministers intended a purge of the army, published an anonymous pamphlet on 24 May 1764, <span class="italic">An Address to the Public on the Late Dismission of a General Officer</span>, written by the historian and propagandist William Guthrie. The address, although not mentioning Walpole by name, tried to force a retraction. Walpole replied with <span class="italic">A Counter-Address to the Public on the Late Dismission of a General Officer</span>. On 30 August Guthrie retaliated with <span class="italic">A Reply to the Counter Address</span>, which insinuated that Walpole was suffering from sexual frustration at being unable to consummate his passion for Conway. Walpole never enlarged upon the background to this allegation, and most of his correspondence with Conway from the early 1760s onwards seems to have been destroyed. This was probably to protect both their reputations, although Walpole was more concerned with their roles in political history than with sexual impropriety. Walpole never denied his affection for his cousin or his desire to advance his political career. The allegation was intended rather to discredit Walpole by exposing his supposed &#145;effeminacy&#146; than to suggest sexual motives on Conway's part.<br>
<br>Conway was seriously alarmed by this crisis and wrote to his brother saying he was now finished with politics but would tell him &#145;how disagreeably I have myself been the object of them&#146;. He added, &#145;I trust their efforts to hurt my reputation have only shown their malice&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 1.xli). However, Conway remained a martyr in the eyes of Grenville's opponents and was envisaged as a prominent component of any ministry they might form. The involvement of Cumberland and Devonshire's brother Lord John Cavendish in negotiations to replace Grenville in late 1764 and early 1765 can have done Conway no harm. Despite the confidence of his friends in his political abilities, Conway still saw the military as his principal career, and it was with great reluctance that he accepted Cumberland's proposal and joined the Rockingham administration in July 1765 as secretary of state for the southern department. The new ministry had hoped to include prominent members of the Commons who could direct government business there, including Charles Yorke, Charles Townshend, and, most importantly of all, William Pitt, but only Yorke joined the administration, as attorney-general. Well before parliament met in December, it was clear that Conway, well-meaning but irresolute under pressure, would be the leader of the Commons.<h2>
<a name="SecretaryofstateunderRockingham"></a>Secretary of state under Rockingham</h2>The administration was concerned initially with matters close to Conway's own circumstances, including the restoration of dismissed army officers and a declaration that general warrants were illegal. They had also committed themselves to Pitt's scheme for a triple alliance between Britain, Russia, and Prussia, and Conway achieved some success in negotiating with the French over their outstanding debts in Canada and the fortifications at Dunkirk. There was no mention of the issue that was to dominate parliamentary affairs for the foreseeable future: the crisis engendered by Grenville's recent <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. As southern secretary, Conway was responsible for American compliance with the act, a potential source of personal conflict, as he had spoken and voted against the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in the Commons in February. The act was to come into force on 1 November. American opposition was first thought by ministers to be the work of a small minority. Conway's response to the letters from Governor Bernard of Massachusetts and General Thomas Gage, received in October, mentioned his military background and expressed the government's reluctance to use excessive force against what they still thought was a temporary disturbance: he ordered Bernard to &#145;inforce a due Obedience to the Laws&#146; with &#145;such a timely Exertion of Force as the Occasion may require&#146;, but endorsed &#145;lenient and persuasive Methods&#146;  (Langford, 80) if possible. Similarly, he told General Gage to use force if other measures were insufficient, but added that Gage should observe &#145;the utmost exertion of your prudence&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 16.113). By December Conway and his colleagues knew that the situation had deteriorated to a stage where the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> was unenforceable without the involvement of an impractically large armed force, and he may have been one of the ministers who argued for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> at the cabinet of 27 December. If so, his position was close to that eventually taken up by the Rockingham government.<br>
<br>Policy formulation was complicated by the growing pressure to restructure the ministry in order to include William Pitt, and negotiations took place in early January 1766. Conway and Grafton at first favoured including Pitt, even though he would not reveal his position on American policy to his potential colleagues without having told the king and parliament first. This was unacceptable to Rockingham, as were Pitt's other demands, which would have seen Newcastle leave the ministry and Rockingham himself give way to Earl Temple, and Conway backed down. Pitt's support for repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> was a mixed blessing for Conway, as he followed it with a denial of parliament's right to impose taxes on the colonies; Pitt's personal authority over the house left Conway in shadow, and it was in this unenviable position that he prepared to introduce the government's resolutions.<br>
<br>As decided by the end of January 1766, repeal was to be preceded by the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span>, affirming British sovereignty in the colonies. Conway told the Massachusetts agent, Dennys De Berdt, that the ministry were for repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> but could secure a majority only by including a measure that asserted parliamentary sovereignty against colonial defiance. His wish that the Americans would petition against the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> to ease the government's way perhaps shows his continued yearning for consensus; his hopes were dashed, for most of the petitions from America directly challenged parliament's authority, in particular that from the congress of colonial representatives which had met in New York in October 1765 to co-ordinate the campaign for repeal. He failed to stop the petition being presented, but it was not received by the house and thus could not be debated, as it was signed by an association and not by individuals. Conway was anxious to assure the Americans that their opinions were not being disregarded, but his main priority was to prevent a Commons debate that could have fired anti-American passions and polarized opinion between Pitt's contention that, as a result of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, &#145;the Original Compact with the Americans was Broke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 1.246) and Grenville's determination that the act should remain in force.<br>
<br>Conway introduced the government's five resolutions, including the clause that would become the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span>, in the Commons on 3 February. The ministry won the day and defeated a resolution by Grenville opposed to repeal, but Conway's contribution to the debate, that repeal was the only way to avoid a war with America and Britain's continental enemies, was overshadowed by speeches from Pitt, Townshend, and Yorke, generally regarded as more effective orators. When repeal itself was debated in the Commons on 21 February, Conway's case, that parliament had a right to tax the colonies but should not actually exercise that power, held the day, although a speech in support of the government by Edmund Burke was considered more decisive.<br>
<br>Horace Walpole later wrote of Conway as the hero of the hour: fellow members of parliament &#145;huzzaed him thrice, stopped him to thank and compliment him, and made a lane for his passage&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 3.29). Yet to many contemporaries his management of the Commons appeared uncertain. Walpole acknowledged that he &#145;could not be induced to traffic with Members, though offended that none of them paid court to him&#146;  (ibid., 3.97). In May 1766, following Grafton's resignation, Conway moved to the northern department and his stepson Richmond succeeded him as southern secretary. This relieved Conway of American problems but underlined the problem that no more senior politician would join an administration seen as fatally crippled.<h2>
<a name="SecretaryofstateunderChatham"></a>Secretary of state under Chatham</h2>Conway was content with the new administration formed in July 1766; Pitt, at the head of the ministry and ennobled as earl of Chatham, told him the administration would consist &#145;of the best and ablest men, without any regard to parties, distinctions and connections&#146;  (Brooke, <span class="italic">Chatham Administration</span>, 12). He remained at the northern department and sought to maintain what appeared to have been Chatham's original plan, to lead a reinforced Rockingham ministry. This foundered on issues of personality and Chatham's determination to break up the party loyalties that had grown up during the 1760s. Conway's mediation between Rockingham and Chatham foundered, and by 25 November most of the Rockingham group had gone into opposition rather than renounce those of their friends whom Chatham felt unsuitable for office. For Conway, for whom the Rockingham ministry had always been an interim administration until a stronger ministry could be formed including Pitt, this was an embarrassment. He chose not to resign, but his estrangement from Chatham and his wish to keep faith both with his old friends and with George III led him to concentrate on routine administration in his department. In March 1767 he appointed David Hume as his under-secretary; Hume had been his brother's secretary as ambassador to France, and the previous year the two had negotiated over a pension for Jean-Jacques Rousseau, then living in Derbyshire.<br>
<br>Conway, and the new southern secretary William Petty, second earl of Shelburne, were expected to put into effect Chatham's &#145;northern system&#146; of diplomacy, which saw Britain as the ally of Prussia and Russia. Conway was more sympathetic to an Austrian alliance and was probably not disappointed when negotiations with Prussia and Russia proved unfruitful. Unlike Chatham, Conway and Shelburne perceived no immediate threat from France and Spain and concentrated on colonial issues and the strengthening of the fragile ministry. A Swedish proposal for a treaty remained unanswered by Conway for eighteen months, causing the ambassador, Baron Gustaf Adolf Nolken, to exclaim: &#145;The Secretaries of State are so busy in Parliament that they conduct their offices like a secondary business&#146;  (Scott, 113).<br>
<br>Conway's instinct for conciliation frequently conflicted with Chatham's more combative approach. Like Charles Townshend, now chancellor of the exchequer, he opposed Chatham's desire to acquire the East India Company's territories for the crown, but was forced by Grafton and George III to acquiesce in the scheme. Even so, during the first debate on the motion to establish a parliamentary inquiry into the company's lands and revenues, he described himself as a passenger in administration. On 26 May 1767 he voted against the ministry's bill to restrain the company's dividends, although the measure passed.<br>
<br>The plan to seize the East India Company's revenues had been intended to meet a perceived gap in government revenues, which Townshend intended to meet by taxing the import of tea and some other household goods into America. Conway was astonished that the plan was never discussed in cabinet. He refused to introduce the plan in the Commons and twice voted against the ministry, on 13 and 15 May. None the less, Townshend's <span class="roman">American Revenue Bill</span> received the royal assent by 29 June with scarcely any effective opposition.<br>
<br>Conway had entered office following his defence of American interests, and, with these interests now threatened by his own government, he told George III and Rockingham in May that he would resign at the end of the session. Rockingham trusted that his secession would lead to a comprehensive administration that encompassed his own followers plus the Grenvilles and Bedfords. Conway hoped to use the ensuing negotiations to bring Rockingham and his friends into the Chatham ministry, believing that Rockingham should be prepared to come in &#145;on his own bottom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; of Grafton</span>, 1.321), in Grafton's words, and not as leader of a new coalition.<br>
<br>As Conway's date for resignation (22 July) approached, Grafton told the king that, without Conway, he must also resign. The king wrote a desperate letter to Lord Hertford: &#145;Indeed your brother has it now in his power to extricate me out of all my difficulties by lending himself to my civil service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 1.499). Conway also found himself a prisoner of the now divided opposition. Rockingham insisted upon his remaining in office, the Bedfords on his returning to the army. Contemporaries and later commentators have thought that these were two incompatible reactions to Grenville's requirement for a stronger American policy, but Bedford's main reservation had been his lack of confidence in Conway as a parliamentarian.<br>
<br>Negotiations failed, and on 31 July Grafton asked Lady Chatham to tell her husband &#145;that General Conway has given him authority to say, that, though the particular situation is not fixed on, he is determined to stand forward in the House of Commons to carry on the king's business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 3.281&#150;2). Conway's rupture with the Rockinghams was complete. Edmund Burke wrote to Rockingham that &#145;Conway is fairly gone to the devil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 1.321), but he continued to seek a middle way, attempting to distance himself from his colleagues while remaining loyal to the king.<br>
<br>In August 1767 Conway was made lieutenant-general of the ordnance, and he continued, at Horace Walpole's suggestion, as secretary of state without salary. However, this gesture failed to appease the anger of the Rockinghams. At the end of the year negotiations between Grafton and the Bedfords at last allowed Conway an honourable escape, and in January 1768 he resigned the northern department to Thomas Thynne, third Viscount Weymouth, and North became leader of the Commons. Conway remained in the cabinet at the king's desire, and was appointed colonel of the 4th dragoons.<h2>
<a name="Driftintoopposition"></a>Drift into opposition</h2>During the new parliament elected in March 1768 Conway, who remained member for Thetford, concentrated on his own work at the ordnance. He was not present at the cabinet meeting on 20 April which decided on Wilkes's expulsion, although he soon afterwards expressed his opposition and successfully postponed action until the subsequent session of parliament. He remained useful as a peacemaker, negotiating compensation with Jeffrey Amherst in July and August 1768 following the latter's dismissal as governor of Virginia. He maintained his interest in American policy and in November and December 1768 objected to the proposals of Wills Hill, earl of Hillsborough, now secretary of state for America, to coerce opposition in Massachusetts, and he even voted against the milder resolution agreed by the rest of the cabinet that condemned the votes of the Massachusetts assembly, which challenged parliamentary supremacy. The cabinet's olive branch to the Americans, decided at a meeting on 1 May 1769, was the repeal of all Townshend's duties except those on tea; Conway, in the minority, sought the repeal of all duties. He had proposed in the Commons on 19 April that the government promise not to levy further taxes against the Americans, and this promise was made.<br>
<br>The Wilkes affair had also returned to plague the cabinet. Conway remained opposed to the expulsion of Wilkes, which offended some cabinet members and George III. He avoided the vote on expulsion in February but then spoke in favour of parliamentary supremacy on 17 March, as the issue had become a matter of &#145;the liberty of the people against the liberty of parliament&#146;  (Brooke, &#145;Conway, Hon. Henry Seymour&#146;, 245). Later he voted for the seating of Henry Luttrell, Wilkes's opponent.<br>
<br>The withdrawal of the Chathamites from the Grafton ministry led to Conway's being offered the position of master-general of the ordnance in January 1770. Conway declined, according to Walpole because he did not want to offend his friend Granby and because he sought to distance himself from the duke of Bedford's party, whose power in the ministry was rising. Instead, he offered to do the work of the master-general without taking the salary. George III is said to have told Conway &#145;he was a phenomenon; that there was no satisfying other people, but he would not take even what was offered to him&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 4.132). As Conway pointed out to Walpole, he did not need the extra &pound;400 in his salary that the promotion would bring. Soon afterwards Lord North became prime minister, and although George III advised him that Conway could be managed through &#145;little marks of attention&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 2.126&#150;7), by October Conway had become sufficiently estranged from his colleagues to resign from the cabinet. That month he was made colonel of the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues). He was at first friendly to the ministry, but in March 1772 he offended George III by opposing the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Bill</span>. Although he said he supported the principle of the bill, he was unable to vote a compliment&#151;that the king's family should ask the sovereign's permission to marry&#151;into a royal right of veto. Despite a reproving letter from his brother Hertford, the lord chamberlain, Conway vigorously opposed the bill in committee. Conway was promoted general on 26 May 1772, but when it became clear that the king intended to appoint George, fourth Viscount Townshend, an officer junior to Conway, as master-general of the ordnance, he resigned from the ordnance on 23 October. &#145;At the earnest solicitation of Lord North&#146;  (Brooke, &#145;Conway, Hon. Henry Seymour&#146;, 246) he was compensated with the governorship of Jersey.<br>
<br>American affairs continued to engross Conway's parliamentary activity, and his wish to preserve his integrity drove further the wedge between him and the North ministry. After the Boston Tea Party in December 1773 he supported the punitive <span class="roman">Boston Port Bill</span> of March 1774 in the hope that support for this measure might allow the repeal of the tax on tea, for which he voted in April. In May he opposed the third reading of North's bill to enhance the powers of the crown in Massachusetts Bay. He defended British authority over America, but expressed his concern that actions since the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> had turned the British government into aggressors against the crown's American subjects.<br>
<br>Without political or meaningful military office Conway was able to devote more time to his private affairs. On 8 June 1774 he left London on a tour of the continent, visiting battlefields in the Netherlands and Germany, dining with his former commanding officer Prince Ferdinand in Brunswick, and proceeding to Potsdam, where he was entertained by Frederick the Great. After a visit to the Saxon court in Dresden he went to Vienna, where he stayed with his friend the British ambassador, Sir Robert Murray Keith. There he was received by Emperor Joseph II and his mother Maria Theresa. He spent a week with the emperor's army near Buda in Hungary before moving to rejoin Frederick the Great with his camp at Breslau in Silesia, then returned to Austrian territory, where he joined Joseph II at a military review in Prague. The tour ended in Paris, where he was joined by his wife and daughter. The <span class="italic">London Chronicle</span> (6 August 1774) was wrong to assume that Conway was engaged in formal diplomatic negotiations on the part of the government; rather, he was reinforcing his personal connections with British diplomats abroad and foreign princes and officials, in anticipation of a full-scale war against the colonies&#151;which to Conway must have seemed certain.<br>
<br>Conway's absence during the general election of 1774 had deprived him of his seat at Thetford. He returned to parliament in March 1775 as MP for Bury St Edmunds, still as a nominee of Grafton. He renewed his criticisms of government policy and on 5 April opposed the third reading of the <span class="roman">Prohibitory Bill</span>, leading Richard Rigby to say he should emigrate to Philadelphia and join the rebels.<h2>
<a name="TheAmericanwar"></a>The American war</h2>Conway from the first strongly opposed the war with the colonies. In the Commons in October 1775 he condemned &#145;the butchery of his fellow-subjects&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">Tea Party to Independence</span>, 278) as &#145;cruel, unnecessary and unnatural&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 18.761). The speech was considered his best by many parliamentarians. He continued to harry the administration on America and in 1776 brought forward a motion requiring to know General William Howe's instructions for seeking peace. He defended the administration where he agreed with their measures, and was often proposed as commander-in-chief, but in the context of the war and the opinions of North and George III this possibility could be little more than mischief-making.<br>
<br>The alliance between the colonies and France in February 1778 led Conway to take an active interest in his position as governor of Jersey, and in June that year he toured the forts and garrisons on the island and on Guernsey. On 1 May 1779 Jersey repulsed a French attack. Conway set sail on hearing the news but reached the island only on 3 May. However, a second partially successful invasion was made on 6 January 1781, during which the lieutenant-governor was briefly captured. Strong weather prevented Conway reaching Jersey, and he later received news that the French attack had been defeated. Greatly unwell, he decided to return to Park Place. While convalescing he received letters from Hillsborough, the secretary of state, which implied dereliction of duty but allowed him further leave of absence, even though the governorship was not a residential one. The matter was smoothed over by a further letter which assured him that his conduct was approved by the king.<br>
<br>Conway continued to oppose the war, often more stridently than the indecisive opposition factions. In 1780 he had introduced an unsuccessful bill to address American grievances once peace was achieved. Respect for his integrity was widespread in the Commons. Once the opposition saw, at the beginning of 1782, that the Commons was in a state where it might vote to end the war and so bring down the North ministry, Conway was identified as the person most likely to succeed in carrying a motion against the further prosecution of an offensive war in North America. The first, on 22 February 1782, was defeated by 194 votes to 193, but on 27 February the motion was repeated and carried by 234 votes to 215.<h2>
<a name="Commanderinchief"></a>Commander-in-chief</h2>North resigned on 20 March; in the Rockingham&#150;Shelburne ministry that followed, Conway became commander-in-chief and a member of the cabinet. His opinions were thought decisive at the cabinet meeting on 30 June which agreed to make American independence conditional on successfully negotiating a general peace treaty. Conway remained in the government following Rockingham's death and the installation of Shelburne as prime minister, and was later attacked in the Commons by both Fox and Burke as politically na&iuml;ve. Shelburne himself had commented on his innocence. Conway said he &#145;looked to measures only, and not to men&#146;  (Brooke, &#145;Conway, Hon. Henry Seymour&#146;, 246). He believed American independence must be a precondition of any negotiation, and would not be deflected by the antagonism between Fox and Shelburne. During the autumn Fox's attacks on the Shelburne ministry revealed splits in the cabinet over the terms for peace with America. Conway agreed with William Pitt the younger, now chancellor of the exchequer, that the provisional articles made with the Americans in November 1782 made independence unconditional. Although by early 1783 Conway had moved closer to the opposition, he supported the government in the vote on 18 February which brought down the Shelburne ministry. He remained as commander-in-chief under the Fox&#150;North coalition but withdrew from the cabinet, and he resigned on the defeat of the coalition in December 1783.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Conway strongly deprecated Pitt's minority administration, writing to Grafton on 4 January 1784 that he considered an administration supported solely by the crown as impracticable. In parliament he inveighed against Pitt's &#145;sulky silence&#146;  (Cannon, 172) after defeat on the <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>. At what turned out to be his last parliamentary speech, on 24 March 1784, Conway told Pitt that &#145;he had hitherto been fool enough to consider the House of Commons as of consequence to the country, and weight in the constitution; but the Right Hon. gentleman had undeceived him &hellip; and proved it to be a cypher&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 24, 1784, 773). Conway expected to be returned at Bury St Edmunds, but the loss of the American colonies and widespread hostility to the Bourbon powers had made his high whig principles unpalatable to electors, and Grafton, finding his influence threatened, replaced him with another candidate.<br>
<br>Conway retired to Park Place, where he immersed himself in arboreal cultivation, a longstanding passion (in 1778 he had given the poet George Crabbe a work on botany), and pursued literary interests. He adapted Louis de Boissy's play <span class="italic">Les dehors trompeurs</span> as <span class="italic">False Appearances</span>, which was performed first at the duke of Richmond's private theatre in May 1788 and in 1789 enjoyed several performances at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. He was also involved in designing the bridge over the Thames at Henley, near Park Place, built between 1785 and 1787, including sculptures of the river gods Thame and Isis by his daughter Anne Damer.<br>
<br>Conway was appointed field marshal on 12 October 1793. He continued to entertain: in 1818 Hannah More remembered &#145;the brilliant society of Field-Marshal Conway's house&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 37.xiv). He died suddenly, of a cramp in the stomach, at Park Place on 9 July 1795, and was buried on 20 July in the Ragley old vault, Arrow church, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Nineteenth-century historians could be dismissive of Conway. Lord John Russell, later first Earl Russell, in <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Charles James Fox</span> (1853&#150;7), and Philip, fifth Earl Stanhope, in <span class="italic">The Life of William Pitt</span> (1861&#150;2), both paid little attention to Conway, portraying him as a parliamentary pawn set amid the Chathams, Bedfords, and Grenvilles. William Hunt, in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, remarked on the attention paid him by Horace Walpole, but said &#145;He was by no means so remarkable a man as Walpole makes him out&#146; although admitting &#145;he was conspicuous for integrity and a delicate sense of honour&#146;. Twentieth-century research on the American War of Independence in British politics has not entirely overturned the picture of Conway as lacking decision or leadership, but has still presented a more impressive picture of him, as a far-sighted and influential figure whose opinions were widely appreciated in Great Britain and America. The towns of Conway, New Hampshire, and Conway, Massachusetts, are testimony to his efforts to avert the conflict between Great Britain and her North American colonies.<br>
