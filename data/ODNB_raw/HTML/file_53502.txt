</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beresford,  George Charles</span>  (1864&#150;1938), <span class="occ">photographer and memoirist</span>, was born at 15 Lypiatt Terrace, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on 10 July 1864, the third son of Major Henry Marcus Beresford (1835&#150;1895) of the 9th foot and his wife, Julia Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of the Revd Francis Richard Maunsell. Marcus Gervais Beresford, archbishop of Armagh, was his grandfather. He was educated at the recently founded United Services College at Westward Ho! in Devon. His study-mates and close friends were Rudyard Kipling and Lionel Charles Dunsterville: in Kipling's <span class="italic">Stalky and Co.</span> (1899), based on their schooldays, Beresford features as M'Turk and Dunsterville as Stalky. Like Kipling, Beresford was destined for a career in India. He passed the annual examination of the Royal Indian Engineering College, Cooper's Hill, in July 1885. He was appointed assistant engineer, second grade, in the public works department on 23 September 1885, although he did not arrive in Bombay until over a year later, joining the architectural executive engineer's and surveyor's office. In November 1888 he went to England on a year's medical furlough (possibly the outcome of a particularly bad attack of malaria, or merely incapacity to endure the climate), but never returned to India to continue in this line of work.<br>
<br>Instead Beresford turned in a wholly different direction, attending the Slade School of Art. He took up the still relatively new profession of portrait photography with great success, working from a studio in Knightsbridge between 1902 and 1932. His platinotype portraits of writers, artists, and politicians appeared regularly in the leading illustrated periodicals of the day. One hundred and eighty-one of his portrait studies are now held by the National Portrait Gallery. These studies of faces (nearly all are of head and shoulders only), while extremely visually pleasing&#151;his haunting studies of the young Virginia Stephen, later Woolf, are understandably much reproduced&#151;also show a considerable degree of insight into the individuals concerned, and many are acute character studies. His wide range of distinguished sitters included Sir Leslie Stephen and members of his family, Sir James Barrie, Keir Hardie, Herbert Asquith, Lloyd George, Yeats, Nancy Astor, and Jacob Epstein. He was also noted as a photographer of children. The aesthetic capabilities behind his success in this field also sustained his allied career as an antique dealer. He moved in the artistic circles of his contemporaries at the Slade and was an intimate of Sir William Orpen, who produced several portraits of him.<br>
<br>However, in spite of his professional association with elevated social circles, Beresford had a questing and questioning spirit. Not entirely surprisingly, given the allegiance to Ruskin that Kipling reflected in the depiction of M'Turk, his artistic interests were wedded to an interest in social reform. He became a member of the Fabian Society and also dabbled in theosophy, although his membership of the Theosophical Society appears to have lapsed quite soon. He was also, it would appear, a supporter of the emancipation of women. He had close ties with the group of extremely radical feminist thinkers associated with <span class="italic">The Freewoman</span> journal, producing a portrait of the founding editor, Dora Marsden, as a supplement for the June 1912 issue, lending his studio for the debates of the Freewoman discussion circles, and providing financial support when it fell into difficulties. During the First World War he donated the profits from his business to the work of the Red Cross.<br>
<br>While maintaining this somewhat bohemian existence in London Beresford appears to have set up a m&eacute;nage in Brighton with Jessica Wilson. The reasons for their not marrying are obscure, but she is mentioned in the will he made in 1917 and he made careful provision for their two sons, Manfred and Vernon Wilson. According to a later codicil to the will Brighton had become his main residence by 1924, although he still maintained his photographic studio in Yeoman's Row off Brompton Road. He retired in 1932, passing on his studio contents to his assistant and retoucher, Miss Gertrude Topliss.<br>
<br>Beresford was active in the establishment of the Kipling Society in 1927, and became no. 1 in the society's roll, serving as a member of council and regularly attending meetings. At the first meeting he gave an account of their schooldays together, advancing the argument that was expanded upon in his book, <span class="italic">Schooldays with Kipling</span> (1936), that <span class="italic">Stalky and Co.</span> was a work of fiction bearing relatively little resemblance to their actual lives at the United Services College, a view disputed by Dunsterville. Beresford died suddenly of coronary thrombosis and atheroma on 21 February 1938 at his home, 21 West Drive, Queen's Park, Brighton, Sussex. He was buried at Brighton.<br>
<br>The impression that remains of Beresford's character is that he was a private person, somewhat aloof and detached, yet capable of considerable generosity to his associates. Kipling's first biographer, Birkenhead, strongly influenced by Dunsterville (a very different character and politically of opposing views), pronounced him embittered and envious of Kipling's success, but this may be an uncharitable reading of someone to whom irony and cynicism were natural modes of expression. His career can hardly be considered that of a failure. The obituary in the <span class="italic">Kipling Journal</span> (45, 1938, 27&#150;8) described him as having a &#145;nonchalant manner&#146; and &#145;seeming appearance of indifference&#146; concealing &#145;a brain with an edge like that of a good razor&#146;, a man of parts capable of generous praise and appraisal of others.<br>
