<span class="headword">Gibson, Sir  Herbert</span>, first baronet  (1863&#150;1934), <span class="occ">landowner and livestock breeder in Argentina</span>, was born at Henderson Place, Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, on 8 July 1863, the fourth son among the nine children of Thomas Gibson (1816&#150;1903) and his wife, Clementina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Corbett (1829&#150;1886). The family had been prominent landowners in Argentina since 1819, with an emphasis on pedigree sheep ranching. After schooling at the county school in Elmham, Norfolk, he embarked on the career path prescribed by his father, starting in 1882 as a managerial apprentice on one of the family's Argentinian ranches (<i>estancias</i>), Los Yngleses, Aj&oacute;, Buenos Aires; the ranch was part of a larger landed business empire incorporated in 1891 into Gibson Brothers (Buenos Aires). Unusually for a British expatriate he became an Argentinian citizen in April 1888, allowing him to serve as president of the school council of the town of Aj&oacute; and, later, as its mayor.<br>
<br>The Gibsons were pioneer breeders of Lincoln sheep in Argentina, demonstrating the breed's suitability to the climate and the export market. Within five years Herbert Gibson became a manager and expert breeder in his own right; under his direction the firm's Linconia stud farm became further renowned for its prize breeding stock. His mastery and passion for the subject was shown in his well-received book <span class="italic">The History and Present State of the Sheep-Breeding Industry in the Argentine Republic</span> (1893). He married in Edinburgh, on 6 July 1895, Madeleine Jessie (1869&#150;1953), widow of George Leonard Paice and daughter of William James Savell, an Anglican clergyman and headmaster of Holborn grammar school, St Clement Danes, London. They had four sons and later, in 1921, adopted a seven-year-old Scottish orphan girl in Buenos Aires.<br>
<br>Gibson's opinion on agro-pastoral matters in Argentina was highly valued, and he published investigative studies in Spanish on topics ranging from dairy farming to ear-marking sheep. An often cited piece was his history of Argentinian husbandry written for the national agricultural census of 1908. He was heavily involved in the Argentinian Rural Society (Sociedad Rural Argentina), the pre-eminent landowners' organization in the country, and became the society's vice-president. His request in 1903 that the Royal Agricultural Society should nominate a judge to adjudicate British cattle breeds at the annual national show in Argentina cemented a transatlantic relationship between Argentinian and British pedigree breeders.<br>
<br>Gibson's contributions to British periodicals helped to popularize Argentina's economic achievements and potential. In Argentina he urged the merits of free trade while excoriating protectionist policies. Recognizing Argentina's natural resources he pointed to the comparative advantage of utilizing its abundant, fertile land to fuel economic growth. A fervent believer in the complementary nature of Argentina's and Britain's economies, he was resolute in his belief that Argentina, through &#145;thrift&#146;, immigration, and the passage of time, would become a heavily populated, non-export-oriented economy. In <span class="italic">The Land We Live On</span> (1914) he dismissed land taxes and mortgage assistance as means to encourage wider landownership, instead placing a laissez-faire trust in Argentina's eventual abandonment of extensive ranching for family-owned farming.<br>
<br>Gibson was a foremost advocate of British community cohesion in Argentina, remaining active in the Scotch Church and St Andrew's Society of the River Plate. As president of the British Literary Society in Buenos Aires he led the organization of the British-Argentine Exhibition of 1905, which extolled British contributions to the nation's development. He was among those who pressed for the establishment of a British chamber of commerce, which came to fruition in 1914; his brother Hope was the chamber's first chairman and he himself held the position from 1927. He also had a particular interest in the anthropology of South American indigenous peoples.<br>
<br>Gibson's family divided their time between residences in Britain and Argentina, with Gibson regularly travelling between the two. In 1915, during the First World War, he was readmitted to British citizenship. He made efforts to be close to his eldest son, an army officer twice wounded on the western front, and joined the Church Army in 1917 to oversee its frontline &#145;huts&#146;, offering recreational facilities for the troops. As a recognized expert on agriculture he served as Britain's wheat commissioner to Argentina and Uruguay to secure supplies for the allies. With a &pound;40 million credit, he oversaw the purchase of a third of Argentina's wheat between the harvests of 1917&#150;18 and 1919&#150;20. For this activity he was made KBE in 1920.<br>
<br>Agricultural depression in Argentina during the 1920s seriously curtailed the family's cash flow, and Gibson took on local directorships of British companies, becoming chairman of the Buenos Ayres Great Southern Railway in 1931. During the visit to Argentina in 1925 of the prince of Wales he arranged the itinerary in the provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios. He spent two years organizing the British Empire Trade Exhibition in Buenos Aires in March 1931, an attempt to augment flagging British exports and underscore the Anglo-Argentine bilateral trade campaign, whose slogan was &#145;Buy from those who buy from us&#146;. Opened by the prince of Wales, the exhibition drew over one and a half million visitors; its success resulted in a baronetcy being conferred on Gibson in June 1931. Reflecting his dual loyalties, he chose to be described as &#145;of Faccombe and Linconia&#146;, the former representing his British home in Hampshire, the second his stud farm in Argentina. He wrote of &#145;the true and lasting bond that unites the two peoples: their common love for the field and the fresh air, the lust for the open spaces of the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 March 1931). After suffering from prostate cancer he died at his Buenos Aires flat, 296 Calle San Mart&iacute;n, on 28 December 1934. Large numbers of Argentinians as well as members of the British community attended his funeral at Chacarita cemetery, Buenos Aires.<br>
