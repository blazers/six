<span class="headword">Barclay,  David</span>  (1682&#150;1769), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in Ury, Scotland, on 17 September 1682, the second son and second child in the family of three sons and four daughters of the Quaker apologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1347/', "Robert Barclay (1648&#150;1690)")</script>, of Ury, and his wife, Christian (<i>c</i>.1651&#150;1724), daughter of Gilbert Molleson of Aberdeen. Barclay's father gave him 9000 Scottish merks (&pound;500) to start on a mercantile career. He was apprenticed on 1 March 1698 to John Perry of London (<i>d</i>. 1718), a member of the Drapers' Company since 1686, as the eighth of Perry's sequence of eighteen apprentices. On completion of his articles on 3 April 1706, Barclay was admitted a freeman of the Drapers' Company; in 1720 he became a liveryman of that company. In 1746 he was elected to its court of assistants, serving until 1768. He was nominated renter-warden (the third of the four wardens of the company) in 1746, and in 1756 master, but on both occasions he paid a fine, as was customary for refusers, to avoid election.<br>
<br>Barclay began to deal in linens while still a freeman, being described in the company's records as &#145;linen-draper of Cheapside at the White Bear&#146;. His cousin John Falconar was already an established Cheapside merchant. Barclay sold Scottish linens on commission, and dealt in Irish linens with his brother, John Barclay of Dublin. He gradually extended the range of his business by exporting German linens to Philadelphia on joint account with local merchants. Already by 1728 one of them was able to describe him as &#145;better Acquainted with our Trade than any Draper in London&#146;  (Price, &#145;The great Quaker business families&#146;, 391). By the time of his retirement in 1767, Barclay's firm was &#145;the first house in their business&#146;  (ibid.), owning ships, and trading to New York, Pennsylvania, the Chesapeake, and the West Indies. At his death, two years later, Barclay was reputedly worth over &pound;100,000. He was an active member of the monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings of the Society of Friends, of its meeting for sufferings, and of the latter's subcommittee for American affairs.<br>
<br>Barclay married, first, on 12 April 1707, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1720), daughter of James Taylor, citizen and glover of London; second, on 8 June 1723, Priscilla, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47419/', "John Freame (1665&#150;1745)")</script> of Lombard Street, a leading Quaker banker. Freame, who was the son of Robert Freame, clothier of Cirencester, was in a banking partnership from the 1690s with his brother-in-law Thomas Gould (<i>d</i>. 1728), son of Thomas Gould, a Quaker of Enfield. Freame married Thomas Gould's sister Priscilla, and Thomas Gould married Freame's sister Hannah, both events occurring in 1697. The banking partnership ended with Thomas Gould's death, Freame continuing alone, then in partnership with his son Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1766), at what later became 56 Lombard Street. In 1733 James Barclay, David Barclay's son by his first marriage, married Sally Freame, Priscilla Barclay's sister (thus his step-aunt) and joined the partnership, which became Freame and Barclay, until his death in 1766. Joseph Freame's own son John (<i>d</i>. 1770) was also a partner from 1759 (Freame, Barclay, and Freame). On Joseph Freame's death, the Barclay interest in the bank continued through the two sons of his sister Priscilla and David Barclay, David and John, who progressively withdrew from their father's linens trade because of the American war, which they strongly opposed. From 1776 the bank was Barclay, Bevan, and Bening, stabilizing as Barclay, Tritton, and Bevan from 1797. It can be seen from this that, although David Barclay senior was not the founder of Barclays Bank, as he has sometimes been named, his sons James, David, and John were important early partners in the bank, and the mercantile fortune he had built up was an important source of capital for it from the 1770s.<br>
<br>Barclay's house at the sign of the White Bear in Cheapside, opposite St Mary-le-Bow Church, was earlier used by Charles II in 1671, William and Mary in 1689, and Anne in 1702, to view the lord mayor's procession. This custom continued under David Barclay, who entertained there George I in 1714, George II in 1727, and the young George III and his new bride in 1761, the last occasion attracting widespread interest in the metropolitan press.<br>
<br>Barclay had two sons and four daughters from his first marriage, and two sons and six daughters from his second. Alexander, a child of his first marriage, was a collector of customs in Philadelphia; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37150/', "David Barclay (1729&#150;1809)")</script>, banker and brewer, from his second marriage, was prominent in the Quaker anti-slavery movement. Barclay died on 18 March 1769 at Bush Hill, Winchmore Hill, Middlesex, a house inherited from his father-in-law John Freame.<br>
