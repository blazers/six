<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Black, Sir  Misha</span>  (1910&#150;1977), <span class="occ">architect and industrial designer</span>, was born on 16 October 1910 in Baku, Russia, the second of the three sons (there was also a daughter) of Lionel Tcherny (1885&#150;1960), merchant, and his wife, Sophia Divinska (<i>d.</i> <i>c</i>.1970), who took him at the age of eighteen months to London. His elder brother was the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65646/', "Max Black")</script>. Lionel Tcherny changed his name to Black in 1911&#150;12 and his son Moisey became Misha. Black received his early education at the Dame Alice Owen School in Islington. He went on to take evening classes at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London and studied briefly in Paris in 1928.<br>
<br>In spite of this modest education Black ended his life as a professor emeritus of the Royal College of Art (from 1975), a trustee of the British Museum (from 1968), an honorary doctor of technology of Bradford University, and an internationally recognized authority on the teaching and practice of industrial design. He arrived at these distinctions by a circuitous route, for industrial design was an unknown, untaught subject when he was born.<br>
<br>Black began his career at the age of seventeen, designing posters and exhibition stands. It was about this time that he met Lucy Rossetti, the great-niece of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The two studied together under Hans Kiesewelter and worked for Messrs Wickham and Arundell Display Ltd. They set up a partnership and set about designing what Black called &#145;stomach fillers&#146; such as book-plates, book jackets, posters, and exhibition stands, under the name Studio Z. They conducted these youthful freelance activities from an attic overlooking Seven Dials. The partnership lasted about a year, after which Black carried on working alone until 1934, when he joined Milner and Thomas Gray and others in the Industrial Design Partnership. His early designs included television and radio sets for E. K. Cole Ltd and the redesign of the Kardomah caf&eacute;s in London and Manchester. It was through his work on commercial display stands that he eventually became a leader in the field of exhibition design working as co-ordinating designer for the 1938 Modern Architectural Research (MARS) Group exhibition <i>New architecture</i> and as interior designer for the British pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1935 he married Helen Lillian, daughter of Frank Foster Evans, engineer, with whom he had one son and one daughter (the marriage was dissolved in 1952).<br>
<br>From 1940 to 1945 Black was principal exhibition architect to the Ministry of Information. In 1946 he designed the &#145;Birth of an Egg Cup&#146; exhibit at the &#145;Britain Can Make It&#146; exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, but his real chance came in 1951 at the Festival of Britain south bank exhibition, of which he was co-ordinating architect for the upstream section, co-ordinating designer for the Dome of Discovery, and co-architect of the Regatta restaurant and the Bailey Bridge. Thereafter he was endlessly busy as architect, designer, or consultant, having formed in 1946, at the instigation of Marcus Brumwell and Herbert Read, his lifelong partnership with Milner Gray, which they cleverly called Design Research Unit (DRU), thereby winning national and international standing as the leading design consultancy in Britain. Although the DRU practice ranged across the whole spectrum of design, Black's own leanings were towards blending art with technics and bridging the gap between industrial and engineering design, particularly in the field of public transport. This led him to consultancies with British Rail, London Transport for whom he designed the stations and trains of the Victoria Line, the Orient Line, British Overseas Airways Corporation, Beagle Aircraft, and the Hong Kong rapid transport system, among others. He went on to become a partner in the architectural practice Black, Bayes, and Gibson, architects, between 1963 and 1977, with whom he designed the Charles Clore pavilion for small mammals at London Zoo.<br>
<br>Black was also active in many societies and public bodies. In 1933, again with Milner Gray, he had been a founder member of the British Society of Industrial Artists and in 1954&#150;6 he was its president, an experience which together with his many foreign friendships led him to become a prime mover in the establishment of the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design, the first meeting of which was held in London in 1957 and of which Black was president from 1959 to 1961.<br>
<br>Black married for a second time in 1955; his new wife was Edna Joan, daughter of George Septimus Fairbrother, engineer, with whom he had one son. That year he also acquired another string to his bow and one that brought him almost more acclaim worldwide than had his widespread professional practice, for it was in that year that he was appointed professor of industrial design at the Royal College of Art, a chair he held until his retirement in 1975. Although Black never himself went to a university, his arrival at the Royal College of Art soon gave academic authority to the profession he had adopted and he became in great demand as a writer and lecturer. His mastery of language was a joy to witness, developing as it did from early pretentiousness to such clarity of thought and expression as to leave audiences eating out of his hand. No one could sum up a debate or seminar or conference more precisely or punctiliously, thereby sending everyone home comforted that some wisdom had transpired. It was indeed for his wisdom that he was picked for membership of all manner of organizations such as the Council of Industrial Design (1955&#150;64), the Design and Industries' Association, the National Advisory Council on Art Education (1959&#150;72), the advisory council to the Science Museum (from 1966), the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry, of which he was master in 1973&#150;4, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and even the National Union of Students, which offered him honorary membership in 1967. He was appointed OBE in 1946 (he was naturalized in 1950, whereupon the OBE was reissued) and knighted in 1972. He became RDI in 1957.<br>
<br>Misha Black wrote on design throughout his career, giving lectures and writing in the popular and design press, and contributing to design manuals. His best-known works are <span class="italic">Exhibition Design</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">Public Interiors</span> (1960). He died in London on 11 August 1977. The British Architectural Library holds a number of his drawings.<br>
