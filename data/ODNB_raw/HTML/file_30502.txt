<span class="headword">Leigh,  Augustus  Austen</span>  (1840&#150;1905), <span class="occ">college head</span>, born at Wargrave, Berkshire, on 17 July 1840, was the sixth son of James Edward Austen (from 1836 Austen Leigh), who when he died in 1874 was vicar of Bray (Berkshire), and Emma (<i>d</i>. 1876), daughter of Charles Smith (1756&#150;1814), MP, of Suttons in Essex.<br>
<br>Austen Leigh entered Eton College  as a colleger in 1852; in 1858&#150;9 he played cricket for the school. In 1859 he entered King's College, Cambridge, as a scholar on the foundation; he gained a Browne medal for Latin ode, and a members' prize for Latin essay in 1862, graduated as fourth classic in 1863, and proceeded MA in 1866. In 1862 he became fellow of his college, where two of his brothers, Edward Compton Austen Leigh (1839&#150;1916) and William Austen Leigh (<i>d</i>. 1921), also held fellowships. He was ordained deacon by the bishop of Lincoln (visitor of the college) in 1865, but his experience as curate of Henley-on-Thames, 1865&#150;7, convinced him that he was unsuited for parochial work and he never proceeded to priest's orders.<br>
<br>In 1867 Austen Leigh returned to King's College, where he spent the rest of his life. He was tutor (1868&#150;81), dean (1871&#150;3, 1882&#150;5), and vice-provost (1877&#150;89), and was then, on the death of Richard Okes, elected provost (9 February 1889), gaining a large majority over the other candidate, Henry Sidgwick. Shortly after his election he married, on 9 July 1889, Florence Emma (<i>b</i>. 1856/7), eldest daughter of George Benjamin Austen Lefroy. They had no children. Austen Leigh's work was that of an administrator, and his leading characteristics were fair-mindedness, courtesy, and unsparing industry. Although an essentially conservative figure, who set great store by college chapel and who regretted the ending of religious tests, he effected far-reaching changes in his college. As a result of a long series of reforms, which took shape in two successive bodies of statutes, ratified in 1861 and 1882 respectively, the college ceased to be a close corporation of Eton collegers. In the furthering of these reforms and in guiding their progress, lay the principal achievement of Austen Leigh's life. To him was largely due the establishment of a tutorial system, which turned the college into an effective centre of teaching. He also promoted closer relations between dons and undergraduates. As provost, he set about uniting the college, which had suffered from a division between the Etonian &#145;best set&#146; and the outsiders recently admitted, and went on to preside with striking success over a period of remarkable intellectual growth.<br>
<br>In 1876&#150;80 and again in 1886&#150;90 he was a member of the council of the senate of Cambridge University, and was vice-chancellor, 1893&#150;5. From 1883 to his death he was president of the Cambridge University Musical Society and from 1886 president of the university cricket club. He was an active member of the governing bodies of Eton and Winchester colleges, from 1889 and 1890 respectively. His only published work was a <span class="italic">History of King's College</span> (1899). On 28 January 1905 he died suddenly in his home, the provost's lodge in King's College, of angina pectoris, and was buried at Grantchester. His wife survived him.<br>
