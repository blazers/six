<span class="headword">Blundell,  William</span>  (1620&#150;1698), <span class="occ">royalist landowner and topographer</span>, was born on 15 July 1620 at Crosby Hall, Little Crosby, Lancashire, the second son of Nicholas Blundell (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;1631) and Jane (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter of Roger Bradshaigh of Haigh, near Wigan. In 1635 at the age of fifteen he married, in Scotland, Anne (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1685), daughter of Sir Thomas Haggerston. On the death of his grandfather, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68216/', "William Blundell")</script>, in July 1638, he succeeded to the family estates. As a Roman Catholic he did not attend university, but as a youth he had a taste both for learning and travel, and visited Dublin in 1639.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1642 Blundell was commissioned at Leigh, Lancashire, as a captain in Thomas Tildesley's dragoon regiment. Made a prisoner at Preston on 9 February 1643, he was released in time to march to Lancaster, where on 18 March 1643 his thigh was shattered by a musket shot. So serious was this that early in 1644 an attempt was made to take Blundell to Chester for proper medical care, and he continually petitioned Sir Thomas Fairfax and the local parliamentary leader John Moore about this. Time spent hiding in north Wales between 1644 and 1646 apparently did not help: Blundell commented that &#145;after I was lamed in the war, tho' I could not use a sword, I was 4 times made a prisoner and payd my ransom twice&#146;  (Baines, 216&#150;17). In addition he claimed that his wound cost him 3 inches in height. In February 1651 Blundell, who dubbed himself Halt-Will, described in a letter to his sister-in-law his &#145;gross full body of an ell or more in the waist, with an old peruke clapped on a bald pate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cavalier</span>, 39).<br>
<br>As a Catholic delinquent Blundell could not compound for his estate, and all his real property was seized by the sequestration commissioners for nine or ten years. In the late 1640s, in order to escape further notice, he resorted to the use of the pseudonym Cicely Burton in signing his letters. On 12 May 1648 his estate was used to finance part of the &pound;10,000 paid to compensate Liverpool for war damage. In 1653, however, he was able to repurchase the estate at a cost of &pound;1340.<br>
<br>Blundell's experiences weighed heavily on him. He later wrote that after the repurchase &#145;I was so overcharged with care, debts, business and imprisonments, that I took no exact account of the value of any goods until the yeare 1658&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cavalier</span>, 40). None the less, he was possessed of a lively, inquisitive mind, and made the most of his travels. In 1646 and again in 1648 he had sailed to the Isle of Man, and his second stay produced the first extensive study of the island. The manuscript work is divided into three books. The first deals with topography and economic geography, the second covers politics, history and the law, and the last discusses Manx customs, society, and religion. The scope of the work makes it a prime source for the history of Man in the seventeenth century and its study of Manx agriculture is deemed to be especially valuable.<br>
<br>Blundell also wrote &#145;A short treatise on the penal laws&#146;. He made copious notes on many subjects in two small quarto volumes of 1200 manuscript pages each entitled &#145;Historia&#146; and &#145;Adversaria&#146;, as well as in a large quarto &#145;Hodge Podge&#146;. None of these is dated. Extracts were published by T. E. Gibson in 1880.<br>
<br>Blundell remained a marked man throughout the Interregnum, being listed as a royalist suspect in 1655 and a holder of a commission in 1658, in which year he visited Rouen. He was also in Breda in 1660 prior to Charles II's departure for England, having taken his youngest son, Thomas, for education at St Omer. With the Restoration his fortunes improved and, after paying a further &pound;1202 5<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. to clear rent arrears to the crown, he was eventually able to settle his estates in 1662.<br>
<br>Much later, in the charged atmosphere following the revolution of 1688, Blundell was again imprisoned, this time at Manchester. He was not arrested in 1694 as he was clearly peripheral to the Lancashire Jacobite plot of that year. Blundell, who had fathered five sons and seven daughters, several of whom had entered convents abroad, died on 24 May 1698 at Crosby Hall and was buried in the family chapel at Sefton parish church three days later.<br>
