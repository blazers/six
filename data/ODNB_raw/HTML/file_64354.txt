<span class="headword">Mahon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tilson]</span>,  Gertrude</span>  (<em>b. </em>1752, <em>d.</em> in or after 1808), <span class="occ">courtesan and actress</span>, was born in Dublin on 15 April 1752, the daughter of James Tilson (<i>c</i>.1715&#150;1764), diplomat, and his wife, Gertrude, dowager countess of Kerry (<i>c</i>.1720&#150;1775), daughter of Richard Lambart, fourth earl of Cavan, and widow of William Fitzmaurice, second earl of Kerry. Her older half-siblings were Francis Thomas Fitzmaurice, third earl of Kerry; Lady Anna Maria Fitzgerald, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fitzmaurice; and, by an earlier marriage of her father, Elizabeth Anne Tilson. She was brought up in the established church. Little is known about her education but at sixteen she attended the home of Charles Burney, in Poland Street, Westminster, for music lessons. Until she was eleven Gertrude lived at Bolesworth Castle, Malpas, Cheshire, the family home; then her father became consul at Cadiz in Spain. Gertrude and her mother moved to London, where they lived at Wigmore Street. In 1764 Gertrude's father died and she received &pound;3000 in his will.<br>
<br>Gertrude's appearance was striking. &#145;A mass of raven hair clustered round her pink cheeks, lustrous black eyes lit up her sweet features&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, 18 April 1777). She was wilful and spoiled by her ineffectual mother and became an outrageous flirt. Frances Burney described Gertrude's behaviour as &#145;An amorosa so forward in Cupid's cause!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 1.25) after Gertrude wrote love-notes to Frances's cousin Charles. At seventeen Gertrude fell in love with a disreputable Irish gambler, Gilbreath Mahon (<i>fl</i>. 1740&#150;1795). Knowing of her inheritance, Mahon proposed but Gertrude's mother would not consent. The pair eloped to France and married in 1769. Gertrude became pregnant in 1770. Her mother then insisted they marry in England and the ceremony took place at St George's, Hanover Square, Westminster, on 14 December 1770, their son, Robert Tilson Mahon, being born on 18 January 1771. Gertrude's mother refused to support Mahon and in 1774 he deserted Gertrude, who returned to her mother's home. Gertrude's mother died on 24 October 1775 leaving Gertrude the interest on her large estate, the capital being held for Robert.<br>
<br>Gertrude could have lived a quiet comfortable life but instead began to cavort with notorious courtesans including Grace Eliot, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dalrymple, Dally the Tall, mistress of the prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) and George Cholmondeley, fourth earl of Cholmondeley, and Kitty Frederick, mistress of William Douglas, fourth duke of Queensberry. In her will Gertrude's mother had stated &#145;I hope that my relations will treat her with kindness and compassion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1029, fols. 169&#150;71), but so scandalized were her family that they refused to have anything more to do with her. From 1776 Gertrude appeared at tawdry venues throughout London. Her name was constantly in the press, which referred to her as the Bird of Paradise because of her love of bright immodest colours and large, many-plumed hats. Scandalous stories of her love affairs with wealthy men abounded. &#145;The Bird of Paradise has taken up residence in the South of France, with Sir J&#151;n L&#151;e, to wash in the pool of Montpelier, famous in the ailment of her trade!&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, 1784, 359). Gertrude's &#145;companions&#146; included Queensberry, Cholmondeley, and Thomas Lyttelton, second Baron Lyttelton, who had tired of their previous mistresses, and numerous officers with private fortunes. In 1780 she met the actress Margaret Cuyler and appeared on stage on 12 December at Covent Garden in John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>. The play sold out but Gertrude was not a success. After two further plays critics described her acting as &#145;Intolerable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, 15 Feb 1781). Diminishing public interest cut short her career. Through acting she met the prince of Wales, but his attentions proved short-lived. In 1784 she was left the interest on &pound;3000 by her half-sister Elizabeth and took a house in Great Portland Street. Her son, Robert, left England in 1785 to join the Indian army. Gertrude then appeared on stage in Dublin but was heralded only for her hats. In 1790 Robert died in Madras aged nineteen and the unhappy Gertrude's popularity waned as her beauty diminished. In 1808, aged fifty-six, Gertrude Mahon &#145;retired&#146; to the Isle of Man and press and public lost interest. There is no obituary or evidence of the date or whereabouts of her death.<br>
