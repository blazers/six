<span class="headword">Shils,  Edward Albert</span>  (1910&#150;1995), <span class="occ">sociologist</span>, was born on 1 July 1910 in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, the younger son of Nathan Shils (<i>b</i>. 1881), a worker in a cigar making factory, and his wife, Esther. His parents were immigrant Russian Jews, his mother a housewife with the conventionally fabled educational aspirations for her sons. Shils was brought up in Philadelphia, where he was educated at the local high school and local university (the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in French literature), from which he emerged with a BA degree in 1931 to face the severe conditions of the labour market of that decade. At first and briefly he worked as a social worker, but then he gradually found his way as Louis Wirth's research assistant into what he saw as the high intellectualism of the University of Chicago. Unsurprisingly in the 1930s he was a Rooseveltian new dealer but, as he matured in the Chicago atmosphere, he became a liberal, distrustful of &#145;the powers&#146;, bellicose against state tyranny of the right and the left, and a devotee of freedom. In the 1970s he also became a neo-conservative in the twentieth-century American sense, trustful of tradition, seeing social order as rooted in face-to-face ties, and finding his utopia in the networks of scientists and scholars intensively looking for truth and protected by the institutions of free science. Co-founder of the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</span> and actively opposed to the tendency which manifested itself as McCarthyism during the cold war, he defended democratic pluralism in his <span class="italic">Torment of Secrecy</span> (1956). He was among the last passionate missionaries of academic freedom, enamoured of German universities in their Humboldtean heyday, always seeking to preserve and to reinvent what he increasingly feared to have been lost by Marxist ideological betrayal and state patronage.<br>
<br>At Chicago, Shils taught first in the college where Hutchins had pioneered the &#145;great books&#146; tradition as a suitable modern but traditional education for undergraduates. He was influenced by Robert Park in the period of Chicago empirical sociology, by Frank Knight in the pursuit of a rigorous logic, and by Leo Szilard in the relentless search for persuasion of the political authorities. He occupied himself energetically with the associated movements towards international control of nuclear weapons. Yet he was faithful to his academic calling, reading the European classics and modern American empirical work, working closely with Talcott Parsons, and publishing widely. Indeed it came to light beyond the circle of his close friends and only on his death that he was engaged on a breathtakingly ambitious, Weber-like project on the movements of knowledge down the ages and across cultures and religions&#151;an unfinished and probably unfinishable programme of scholarly research. Such was the grandeur of his reading and his knowledge of disciplines, languages, and history.<br>
<br>When the USA entered the war Shils seized the opportunity of coming to Europe, not, for obvious reasons, to extend his already formidable knowledge of German sociology, but to visit England where he worked jointly for the British government and for the US office of strategic services, interviewing German prisoners. His conclusion, confirmed by later research, was that the influence of primary group loyalties rather than the Nazi ideology sustained the fighting power of the Wehrmacht. Meanwhile he soon penetrated and enjoyed the London circles of European intellectuals, including Raymond Aron (then a member of the Free French forces). After the war he became one of the first &#145;transatlantic&#146; academics, with a joint post at the London School of Economics (LSE) and Chicago. He became interested in monarchy, writing perceptively on the coronation of 1953 in the <span class="italic">Sociological Review</span>. Later, in 1961, he went to King's College, Cambridge, and later still (in 1970) to Peterhouse to escape the influence of Edmund Leach, who was referred to by Lord Dacre as &#145;the swinging provost&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minerva</span>, 92). He meanwhile retained his connection to Chicago where he had, with John Nef, founded the Committee on Social Thought. He knew an extraordinary number of intellectuals in Europe, North America, and Africa, as well as in India&#151;where he made a special study of their place in society and wrote a much discussed monograph, <span class="italic">The Intellectual between Tradition and Modernity</span> (1961). He seemed to be in perpetual motion, arriving everywhere to congresses, conferences, and conversations, yet he was an essentially private man.<br>
<br>Shils was also a busy man, with a fresh, freckled face and ginger hair, aggressive, and either scowling in the face of an enemy or smiling at the sight of a friend, &#145;Not&#146;, as Noel Annan has written, &#145;afraid to bludgeon with his erudition those who did not realise sociology was a subject that rested on a great European intellectual tradition&#146;  (Annan, 255). For the students at the LSE after the Second World War there was as magnificent a professorial presentation of the social science scenery as could be found in the Western world. For a small minority of them, mostly grammar school boys returned from the war, the ambition to become professional sociologists formed the first generation of a remarkable group of academics who went on as the vanguard of a rapid expansion of the subject in the British provincial universities. Two men stood out as their guides&#151;David Glass and Edward Shils. Both, oddly enough, were indifferent lecturers, but they were endowed with a compelling charisma (a word which came into lay vogue in the 1940s). Glass was precise in research technique and learned in the LSE tradition of demographic and statistical investigation. Shils provided an alternative spur to their implausible academic aspiration. He not only presented classical European sociology to them but did so in an American voice which simply assumed that undergraduates would become graduate students and subsequently professionals. His blend of tutorial ferocity and Olympian erudition challenged their still half-formed ambition to fearful effort. His <span class="italic">Current State of American Sociology</span> (1948) conveyed the conviction that a subject of great difficulty and worth was at once both dignified in its European antiquity and accessible in its American modernity. Sociological research beckoned as a living practice as well as a hallowed tradition.<br>
<br>Perhaps Shils's most enduring interest was in the university as an organization for the creation and preservation of important knowledge. To this end he founded <span class="italic">Minerva</span> in 1962 and was its active, some thought over-active, editor until the end of his life. Many if not most contributors would have their scripts returned and find them cascaded in showers of green ink by the editor's comments and suggestions&#151;in effect rewritten. For Eric Ashby this gave Shils a claim to being the outstanding editor of the century. Certainly no editor put a firmer stamp on his journal. Accordingly he earned many enemies, not only as an overbearing editor but as a rancorous disputant and a ruthless manipulator of colleagues and students. Yet he also had the love of many friends, as the memorial issue of <span class="italic">Minerva</span> amply showed.<br>
<br>Shils was a complicated man. Sometimes his prose could be turgid, sometimes weighty and incisive. Sometimes his conversation could be portentous and delivered in long, Latinate, and periodic paragraphs. At other times he could relax over a good meal, perhaps one he himself had cooked, to retail academic and literary gossip and anecdotes in short, sharp, racy quips from the New York and Chicago Jewish communities. Community is what he longed for. He could not find it in marriage: he was married twice (first to Ruth Almond, second to Irene Coltman), and was divorced twice. Even survey interviewing was seen by him as a kind of moral conviviality. He was a Jew who neither believed nor practised, but he was nevertheless proud of his ancestry and deeply if sceptically pious, knowing and deploring the secular tendency among his colleagues towards the false belief that reason could put religion to flight. For him the unsolved mystery of life was that the roots of rationality lay in human emotions. A large picture of him is hung in the Shils Seminar Room at the University of Chicago. He was a generous benefactor to Peterhouse, Cambridge, both to the college library and in endowing the Dacre lectures. He died of cancer in Chicago on 23 January 1995, leaving one son from his second marriage. His ashes were scattered over the river in Philadelphia.<br>
