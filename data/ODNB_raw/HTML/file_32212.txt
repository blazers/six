<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  Harold Beresford</span>  (1883&#150;1951), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Oxford on 6 October 1883, the elder son in the family of two sons and two daughters of Alfred Joshua Butler (1850&#150;1936), fellow and bursar of Brasenose College and a noted Coptic scholar, and his wife, Constance Mary Heywood, a granddaughter of Marcus G. Beresford, archbishop of Armagh. He was a scholar of Eton College and a Brackenbury scholar and Jenkyns exhibitioner of Balliol College, Oxford, where he was captain of the hockey eleven. After obtaining a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> he was elected a fellow of All Souls College in 1905.<br>
<br>Butler's early ambition was to enter the Foreign Office and after a year at All Souls he went to Germany and France, where he obtained a knowledge of the countries and their languages which later proved of great value to him. There were, however, no vacancies in the Foreign Office and he entered the Local Government Board in 1907, transferring to the Home Office in the following year.<br>
<br>In 1910 he married Olive Augusta Newenham, daughter of Samuel Abraham Walker Waters, assistant inspector-general of the Royal Irish Constabulary, of Stillorgan, co. Dublin. They had one daughter and two sons. Their younger son was the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63970/', "Rohan D'Olier Butler")</script>.<br>
<br>Butler had his first experience of international work as secretary to the British delegation to the conference on aerial navigation in 1910. Although he was a captain in the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps, he was refused permission to join the forces on the outbreak of war in 1914. His section of the Home Office, concerned with blockade measures, was ultimately merged with the corresponding section of the Foreign Office as the foreign trade department, of which he became secretary in 1916. A year later he was transferred to the newly created Ministry of Labour at the insistence of the parliamentary secretary and fellow Etonian, W. C. Bridgeman. His role was to inject some administrative expertise, denied to the ministry by the political appointment of two trade unionists as minister and permanent secretary, and to develop a long-term industrial strategy. For two years he exerted a radical influence, about which he was later wistful  (Butler, 134, 145). He recruited committed Labour sympathizers to compile weekly reports for the war cabinet, to counter its relative ignorance of industrial matters, and to encourage industrial self-government, particularly through the spread of Whitley councils and trade (wages) boards. His commitment to &#145;home rule for industry&#146; placed him at odds with the centralizing bias of existing labour administrators such as William Beveridge. &#145;No system of bureaucratic control&#146;, he argued, could succeed in Britain because of people's innate belief in &#145;their competence to manage their own affairs&#146; and the effective resolution of problems being dependent on the genuine commitment of those involved  (Lowe, 67&#150;8). These were the firmly held views which guided him as he moved from the national to the international stage.<br>
<br>In 1918, with Edward Phelan and in a somewhat more tense relationship with Malcolm Delevingne, Butler drafted a programme for the labour section of the Versailles peace conference. It was adopted and he was appointed secretary to the organizing committee and then the secretary-general of the first labour conference, held in Washington in 1919. Here the constitution of the International Labour Organization was agreed, based on Butler's novel principle of equal representation for government, employers, and workers. The conference faced serious difficulties as it had neither independent staff nor funding and the American government, having failed to ratify the peace treaty, was unable to participate. Its eventual success was largely due to Butler's diplomatic and administrative skill. He narrowly failed, however, to be elected the provisional director because there were obvious objections to men of the same nationality holding the senior posts in both the League of Nations (of which Sir Eric Drummond was the first secretary-general) and the International Labour Office. Instead he was appointed deputy director of the office, based in Geneva, under Albert Thomas, with particular responsibility for administration and finance. He was able to build up an efficient international staff and to counteract any tendency to over-centralization.<br>
<br>Butler succeeded Thomas as director in 1932 in the depths of the depression which made international co-operation increasingly difficult. His term of office demonstrated his commitment to international co-operation, although he was realistic about the possibilities for change. He showed himself to be a man of vision, but not a visionary: a Conservative with strong Labour sympathies and a man of deep-rooted principle.<br>
<br>Butler's first practical concern was to induce America to join the organization, which it did in 1934. Believing that the centre of gravity in the world was shifting away from Europe, he sent his staff to give technical advice to overseas governments, established an overseas section of the office, and in 1934 induced the conference to enlarge the governing body so that seven non-European countries were among the sixteen governments represented. He initiated regional conferences in the belief that many problems were of regional rather than universal significance. Throughout his term of office he also insisted that attention be paid to the economic conditions which lay behind the social problems.<br>
<br>In 1938 Butler resigned under pressure from the French government  (Alcock, 155) and shortly afterwards accepted the post of first warden of Nuffield College, Oxford. There he had time only to lay plans, as on the outbreak of war he was appointed southern regional commissioner for civil defence and, after returning to the college in January 1942, he went to Washington, DC, in May of that year as head of the British information service. He resigned from the wardenship in June 1943, having helped to initiate the Social Reconstruction Survey, directed by G. D. H. Cole, to inform the planning of the transition from peace to war. He remained in Washington until his retirement in 1946, after which he was prominent in the movement for closer European co-operation. He was appointed CB in 1919 and KCMG in 1946.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Butler wrote the first of his three books, <span class="italic">The Lost Peace</span> (1941), on the inter-war years. This was followed in 1947 by <span class="italic">Peace or Power</span> and in 1950 by <span class="italic">Confident Morning</span>, the first volume of an uncompleted autobiography. He died at the Dunedin Nursing Home, Bath Road, Reading on 26 March 1951.<br>
