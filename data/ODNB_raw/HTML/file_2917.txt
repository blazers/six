<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Borrer,  William</span>  (1781&#150;1862), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Henfield, Sussex, on 13 June 1781, the eldest of the three sons of William Borrer of Hurstpierpoint, landowner and sometime high sheriff of Sussex, and his wife, Mary, daughter and coheir of Nathaniel Lindfield of Dean House. He received his early education in private schools, at Hurstpierpoint and at that run by John Morphew at Carshalton in Surrey. Although he left school at an early age he continued his studies under tutors and obtained a good knowledge of the classics, French, and theology.<br>
<br>In spite of his own inclination for medicine, Borrer joined in his father's farming business. At first this involved supplying forage to troops stationed around Sussex and for these journeys he travelled on horseback, examining and collecting the plants which he passed. Initially encouraged by some of the military officers, he became acquainted with many of the first botanists of the age, including Joseph Banks, Dawson Turner, and W. J. Hooker. He developed an extensive botanical correspondence in Britain and on the continent.<br>
<br>Borrer travelled widely in the study of plants, in 1810 visiting Scotland with Hooker, who was also his companion on an excursion to Normandy. He made repeated journeys in all parts of Britain, seeking out species reported in unlikely locations and always vigilant for new discoveries. He endeavoured to cultivate every critical British species and all the hardy exotic plants he could obtain, having at one time 6660 species in his garden. By planting species which were only with difficulty distinguished next to one another he made faithful determinations of their distinct qualities.<br>
<br>Borrer's herbarium of British plants, which went on his death to Kew Gardens, was esteemed as one of the best. It was especially rich in the flora of Sussex, which had received little prior attention. His specimens were very reliably named but often lacked date or locality. The comprehensiveness of the herbarium was attributed to Borrer's own application and his willingness to share his knowledge with others, who returned his kindness with specimens.<br>
<br>Borrer's first contribution to the literature was a comprehensive list of and critical notes on Sussex flowering plants, ferns, fungi, lichens, and algae which appeared in Turner and Dillwyn, <span class="italic">Botanist's Guide</span> (1805), along with some records for Kent, Surrey, and Hampshire. On his own, however, he published little: a few notices in the <span class="italic">Phytologist</span>; some descriptions in the supplement to <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (1830), especially of lichens, <i>Salix</i>, <i>Rosa</i>, and <i>Rubus</i>; and, with Dawson Turner, the privately printed <span class="italic">Lichenographia Britannica</span> (1839). His method for the genus <i>Salix</i> was adopted by Hooker in <span class="italic">Flora Britannica</span> (1830), as were his descriptions of <i>Myosotis</i>, <i>Rosa</i>, and <i>Rubus</i>.<br>
<br>Borrer is credited with the identification of twenty-one species of flowering plants, which ranged in location from Cornwall to Caithness, and in addition worked on ferns, lichens, and algae and made several discoveries of rare seaweeds.<br>
<br>Expertise on British plants was Borrer's strongest recommendation: he was considered a reliable authority on the correctness of localities assigned to plants and a good judge of their claims as native productions. His work was characterized by precise description and meticulous detail. The want of a major publication associated with his name has, however, limited the subsequent recognition of his contemporary importance. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1805, and of the Royal Society in 1835, and was also a member of the Wernerian Society. Several plants were named after him.<br>
<br>On 28 March 1810, Borrer married Elizabeth, the daughter of Nathaniel Hall, a banker in Brighton. They had five daughters and three sons who survived to adulthood. He served as a justice of the peace for Sussex. While never gregarious, Borrer always welcomed without introduction those who wished to consult his herbarium or garden. He also made many charitable contributions to his community, especially in the development of schools. He helped to establish national schools in Henfield, built a school for girls and one for infants on his own land, and personally undertook the education of three or four boys, subsequently finding them employment. He was active in and generous to the local church.<br>
<br>Borrer's personal fortune made it possible for him to devote his time to those things which interested him. However, in botany, his gentlemanly amateurism was enhanced by application, attention to detail, and precision. He was both zealous and able. He died at his home, Barrow Hill, Henfield, on 10 January 1862 from pleurisy, having been in failing health for a decade.<br>
