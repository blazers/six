<span class="headword">Nutt,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1700, <em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">surveyor of highways</span>, son of Robert Nutt and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper, was born in Hinckley, Leicestershire, and was baptized there on 2 October 1700. He was educated at the free grammar school, Hinckley, and was subsequently apprenticed to John Parr, a local apothecary. He went on to study in London hospitals before returning to Hinckley, where he became successful and popular, frequently treating the poor for nothing. Having been elected as a surveyor of highways for Hinckley parish, he introduced a system of periodically flooding the roads, producing a firm, substantial, and smooth surface for the considerable local traffic generated by the nearby coal mines. The regular flooding also benefited adjacent farmland.<br>
<br>Nutt's procedure was resisted; there were efforts to eject him from office, and he was subjected to ridicule, but the success of his methods ensured considerable local support. His opinion as a land valuer was also highly regarded locally. John Dyer, the poet, was a friend of Nutt, and celebrated his useful talents in his poem &#145;The Fleece&#146; (1757).<br>
<br>Nutt married Susannah Goode (1714&#150;1799) on 25 December 1774. He died at Hinckley on 16 October 1775, and was buried in the churchyard. By his will he left six oak trees to provide, within forty years of his death, the fabric for a new market place for Hinckley, with a school and town hall above it.<br>
