<span class="headword">Havilland,  Geoffrey Raoul  de</span>  (1910&#150;1946), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 18 February 1910 at Crux Easton, Hampshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32769/', "Sir Geoffrey de Havilland (1882&#150;1965)")</script> and his wife, Louise (1881&#150;1949), daughter of Richard Thomas, of Chepstow. His father in 1920 founded the De Havilland Aircraft Company Ltd, which became a worldwide enterprise under his technical leadership.<br>
<br>The eldest of three sons, Geoffrey Raoul was born near to the site of his father's first flying experiments, which attained the success of full controlled flight in the summer of 1910. It was about this time that he experienced his first flight, carried in his mother's arms in a plane piloted by his father. When he and his brothers later went to school&#151;Geoffrey was educated at Stowe School (1924&#150;7)&#151;their parents would visit them by Gipsy Moth, landing in a field in the school grounds for a picnic lunch. All three boys grew up with the sound of aeroplane engines a constant presence in their lives.<br>
<br>In 1928 Geoffrey entered the De Havilland company at Stag Lane, Edgware, as an apprentice. While serving his three years in the engineering departments, he learned to fly at the Royal Air Force Reserve School on Stag Lane aerodrome, and then spent about a year in South Africa, where he gained useful flying experience. After returning to England in 1932 he became a flying instructor at the De Havilland Aeronautical Technical School and later at the London Aeroplane Club, which had by then moved to the company's new aerodrome at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. From the first he had shown exceptional ability as a pilot, and a desire to follow this calling in its most exacting branch led him to turn, at the age of twenty-five, from flying instructor to test pilot on the staff of the parent De Havilland company.<br>
<br>The first aircraft which de Havilland tested was an economical twin-engined transport called the Dragon, which was being manufactured for world use. Aircraft of this class, including Dragonflies, Dragon Rapides, and four-engined DH 86s, occupied him for a couple of years until the company produced a clean, high-performance twenty-two-passenger monoplane airliner, the Albatross, for Imperial Airways. The later development trials of this were conducted by Geoffrey de Havilland when he became chief test pilot in succession to Robert John Waight, who was killed in a flying accident on 1 October 1937.<br>
<br>Taking Waight's place was a considerable step for one who had not up to that time flown a wide variety of aircraft. Fifteen months later de Havilland undertook the first flight of a twin-engined metal transport aircraft, the Flamingo, and conducted its whole flight development. For the next seven years he made the first flight, and did the tests, of every De Havilland prototype. They were the years of the war when the De Havilland company entered wholesale the field of military aviation, and the aircraft concerned were high-performance combat machines, the fastest in their categories. Notable among them were the Mosquito twin-engined two-seat multi-purpose aircraft, first flown on 25 November 1940; the Vampire jet fighter with De Havilland Goblin engine, 20 September 1943; and the Hornet long-range twin-propeller fighter, 28 July 1944. He visited Canada in 1942 to test the Canadian-built Mosquito and to demonstrate it in Canada and the United States. In recognition of his services he was appointed OBE in 1945.<br>
<br>De Havilland was a keen sporting pilot and took part in a great many races and contests. He shone in the low turns of pylon racing and was one of the finest exhibition pilots British aviation has known. His favourite personal racer was a clean little monoplane, the TK 2, designed and built by students of the De Havilland Aeronautical Technical School. With a love of the sport he combined a serious attitude to his work. His upbringing helped him to become a practical and analytical test pilot of the calibre most valuable to the aerodynamicist and the designer. In 1933 de Havilland married Gwendoline Maud Alexander. The marriage was dissolved in 1942 and he married in 1943 Pipette Marion Scott Bruford. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Geoffrey de Havilland met his death above the Thames estuary on 27 September 1946, when testing an experimental tailless high-speed jet aircraft, the DH 108, in preparation for an attempt on the world speed record. It is probable that he exceeded this during his last flight. The wreckage of his plane was found the next day, scattered over the mudflats of Egypt Bay, near Sheerness, and his body was discovered at West Beach, Whitstable, over a week later. The precise cause of the crash was never established. Geoffrey's youngest brother, John, had been killed while testing a Mosquito on 23 August 1943, and their father later recalled how he had discussed with both of them the dangers of test flying, but that neither had taken these talks &#145;very seriously&#146;:<blockquote>They started a strange habit of refusing to call aeroplanes by their proper name. Geoffrey usually referred to them as &#145;boilers&#146;. &#145;If I take a boiler up and it blows up,&#146; he used to say, &#145;it's just bad luck. But nothing's going to stop me.&#146; (de Havilland, 197)</blockquote>They were buried in Tewin churchyard, near Hatfield, where their mother was also laid to rest, not long after her eldest son's death.<br>
