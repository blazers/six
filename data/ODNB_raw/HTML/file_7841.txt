<span class="headword">Dornford,  Joseph</span>  (1794&#150;1868), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 9 January 1794 in Deptford, Kent, the son of Josiah Dornford and the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7842/', "Josiah Dornford")</script>, miscellaneous writer. He was brought up in an atmosphere of evangelical piety. His mother, Esther, formerly Mrs Thomason, was by her first marriage the mother of Thomas Truebody Thomason (1774&#150;1829), curate to Charles Simeon, the evangelical leader at Cambridge. She was described  (Mozley, chap. 78) as Simeon's chief lady friend, and as pouring out the tea for his weekly gatherings.<br>
<br>Dornford entered young at Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating in 1811, but he suddenly left to serve as a volunteer in the Peninsular War. Mozley explained: &#145;He would rather fly to the ends of the earth and seek the company of cannibals or wild beasts than be bound to a life of tea and twaddle&#146;  (Mozley, 2.56). He saw some service, and on his return home entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he gained a first in the classical school and a second in the mathematical, proceeding BA in 1816. In 1817 he was elected to a Michel fellowship at Queen's, and in 1819 to a fellowship at Oriel, where he graduated MA in 1820. In August of that year he joined Dr Joseph von Hamel on the well-known ascent of Mont Blanc in which three guides were killed, of which he subsequently wrote an account in the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>. Ordained in 1821, he was appointed a tutor of Oriel in 1823 in succession to John Keble, a disappointment to Keble's pupils, though he proved a good lecturer. His martial exploits earned him the sobriquet the &#145;University Corporal&#146; when he served as a proctor in 1830.<br>
<br>In 1832 Dornford was presented by his college to the rectory of Plymtree, Devon, and in 1847 he was collated by Bishop Phillpotts prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. He published nothing save a few sermons. One of these, &#145;The Christian sacraments&#146;, is contained in a volume edited by the Revd Alexander Watson, <span class="italic">Sermons for Sundays, festivals, and fasts, and other liturgical occasions, contributed by bishops and other clergy of the church</span> (1845). In his bearing Dornford was more of a soldier than a priest, and his talk ran much on war. He was a man of strong will, generous impulses, and pugnacious temper. Sympathetic to the Tractarians, his high-church innovations aroused opposition in his parish; further strife was caused by Dornford's gallantry towards the female members of his flock. Remaining a bachelor until late in life, despite a string of courtships, he eventually made what Mozley described as a &#145;quiet, domestic marriage&#146;, marrying on 31 May 1855 Emma Louisa, daughter of Lieutenant Josiah Dornford RN, a distant relative. Dornford died at Plymtree on 18 January 1868, survived by his wife and at least one son, Arthur Clifford Dornford (<i>b</i>. 1862), later a medical practitioner.<br>
