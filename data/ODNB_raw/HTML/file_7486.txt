<span class="headword">Denison,  Edward</span>  (1801&#150;1854), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was born at 34 Harley Street, London, on 13 March 1801, son of John Denison, formerly Wilkinson (1758?&#150;1820), of Ossington, Nottinghamshire, a merchant and politician, and Charlotte, his second wife, daughter of Samuel Estwick, a West India planter and MP for Westbury. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7490/', "(John) Evelyn Denison (1800&#150;1873)")</script>, speaker of the House of Commons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7488/', "George Anthony Denison (1805&#150;1896)")</script>, archdeacon of Taunton, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7492/', "Sir William Thomas Denison (1804&#150;1871)")</script>, colonial governor, were his brothers. He was educated at Esher and Eton College, matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1818, graduated BA with first-class honours in 1822, and entered the Middle Temple. Regarded as one of the most promising men of his generation at Oxford, he was elected fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1826, and proceeded MA in 1827. Ordained on 23 December 1827 as assistant curate successively of Wolvercote, near Oxford, and Radcliffe, Nottinghamshire, he became vicar of St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, and a prebendary of Southwell in 1834. He was a traditional high-churchman of liberal whig sympathies. Lord Melbourne nominated him bishop of Salisbury in 1836. Joseph Blanco White alleged he was appointed because, although learned, he never published, and was passive in theology, and it was difficult to find a sympathetic Oxford whig to prefer.<br>
<br>On 27 June 1839 Denison married Louisa Mary (<i>b</i>. 1812), daughter of Henry Ker Seymer of Hanford, Dorset, who died on 22 September 1841. It was of this first marriage that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7487/', "Edward Denison (1840&#150;1870)")</script> was born. He married secondly, on 10 July 1845, Clementina (<i>b</i>. 1812), daughter of Charles Baillie-Hamilton, archdeacon of Cleveland, who died on 12 May 1894.<br>
<br>Denison supported reform in the church, but criticized the legislation for merely diverting revenues to purposes deemed of greater utility. In the Lords he amended the <span class="roman">Cathedrals Bill</span> to retain prebendal stalls and their titles after the alienation of their endowments. In appointing new prebendaries at Salisbury he preferred senior clergy from the diocese, and encouraged residentiaries to become involved in diocesan work. He was an early advocate of the revival of synodical government in the Church of England.<br>
<br>Denison criticized the Tractarians for their exaggerated views, declining to support Pusey and Newman's projected <span class="roman">Library of the Fathers</span> in 1838 and joining in the condemnation of <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>. He did not always see eye to eye with his Tractarian brother George Anthony Denison, most notably at the outset of the controversy over eucharistic doctrine sparked by the latter in 1853&#150;4. However, he presented Walter Kerr Hamilton, his Tractarian successor at St Peter-in-the-East, to a canonry of Salisbury and encouraged him to &#145;improve&#146; worship in the cathedral. Later he recommended Hamilton to Lord Aberdeen as his successor, and he was duly appointed.<br>
<br>As a reforming bishop Denison established a church building society and discouraged pluralism. He gave concomitant encouragement to clerical residence, despite the smallness of the population in many parishes. He noted a steady increase in the number of parishes where there were two Sunday services and monthly holy communions. He used the new railways to visit his clergy regularly and to conduct confirmations in more parishes, confirming in sixty-four places compared with his predecessor's nine confirmation centres.<br>
<br>In the alarm over government grants to denominational schools based on satisfactory inspection reports, Denison, along with bishops Blomfield and Kaye, sought to avoid confrontation with the government, and persuaded Archbishop Howley to a compromise, giving the archbishop of Canterbury a veto in the appointment of inspectors. Denison feared that lack of provision of education contributed to the restlessness of the poor in industrial towns. In many parishes too small to support day schools, he encouraged Sunday schools when evening schools were unsuccessful. He established a diocesan board of education, a system for inspecting schools, and an institution for training schoolmistresses.<br>
<br>Denison criticized the new poor law, rejecting as self-righteous the individuality of political economy. He saw the poor as victims of the faults of their betters, including the church. He discouraged clergy from serving as guardians, and regretted the church's identification with the new workhouses, believing the church was becoming cut off from the poor. He encouraged the establishment of friendly societies to assist the poor to save money. In the Salisbury cholera epidemic of 1849 he was reputed to have visited many of the sufferers. He was reckoned to have given away more than &pound;17,000 to charitable causes in his lifetime. Denison died on 6 March 1854 at the bishop's palace, in Salisbury, aged fifty-two, and was buried in the cathedral cloister garth on 15 March.<br>
