<span class="headword">Jemmat <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Yeo]</span>,  Catherine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1714, <em>d.</em> 1766?), <span class="occ">memoirist</span>, was baptized on 12 November 1714 at St Thomas the Apostle, Exeter, the eldest of three children of John Yeo (<i>d</i>. 1756), a half-pay admiral, and his first wife. The family moved to Plymouth shortly after her birth. She is known for her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (2 vols., 1762; 2nd edn, 1765), the chief source of information about her life. There, she describes her father as an indifferent sailor and, at home, &#145;a bashaw, whose single nod of disapprobation struck terror into the whole family&#146;  (Jemmat, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.5). Her mother died when she was five or six years old and, within months, her father had married &#145;a giggling girl of nineteen&#146;  (ibid., 1.10); they had five children, four of whom died. Catherine Yeo was sent to a boarding-school for a time; she describes herself as &#145;endow'd with a quick genius, and a propensity to learn whatever was in the reach of my capacity&#146;  (ibid., 1.16). She left the boarding-school &#145;to learn plain work, under the care of three gentlewomen&#146;  (ibid., 1.17), and eventually returned to her father's house.<br>
<br>Much of Catherine's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> describes the tensions between her own &#145;giddy and romantic&#146; nature  (Jemmat, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.118&#150;19) and her father's desire to arrange a financially advantageous marriage for her. She characterizes herself as being &#145;used to the gaiety of public places; to a perpetual round of company&#146;  (ibid., 2.4), and the first volume of her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> is largely devoted to accounts of her numerous suitors. But Catherine also implies that her father resorted to domestic violence in his efforts to control her choice of husband, for she characterizes his behaviour as &#145;insupportable, and such as I had much rather the reader would guess at &hellip; than I should attempt further to illustrate&#146;  (ibid., 1.96). She does describe being &#145;lock'd &hellip; up for two months&#146; in order to be kept apart from one of her suitors, &#145;during which space, I never saw a creature but the person who brought me victuals; I was neither suffered to have pen, ink, or paper&#146;  (ibid., 1.52). Finally, she &#145;resolved to marry the first person who should propose himself to me&#146;  (ibid., 1.166).<br>
<br>Catherine's resolution resulted in marriage to a Mr Jemmat, a Plymouth silk mercer. He claimed to have &#145;a pretty fortune of about three thousand pounds, well laid out in business&#146;  (Jemmat, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.1), and offered his &#145;affection and fortune&#146; as a means of escape &#145;from the tyranny of a relentless father&#146;  (ibid., 2.7&#150;8). After their marriage they returned to Jemmat's home and business in Plymouth: the house was &#145;an hog-sty&#146;  (ibid., 2.33), and Jemmat himself alcoholic and physically abusive, with &#145;no intentions to settle in the world, or to obtain the reputation of an upright man&#146;  (ibid., 2.33). She described their marriage:<blockquote>night after night, like a poor submissive slave, have I laid my lordly master in his bed, intoxicated and insensible: day after day have I received blows and bruises for my reward: in short, I thought I had married a man, I found I had married a monster. (ibid., 2.57)</blockquote>She also soon learned that Jemmat married her in order &#145;to extort money from my father to pay his creditors, who were very numerous and pressing&#146;  (ibid., 2.34); when her father refused to comply, Jemmat finally went bankrupt within three years of their marriage. By this time, Catherine Jemmat had given birth to a daughter. Despite the intervention of her friends, Admiral Yeo refused to help his daughter, with the result that she was &#145;thrown upon the wide world for support&#146;  (ibid., 2.58).<br>
<br>Catherine Jemmat employs many of the stock defences of the eighteenth-century woman writer to justify her entrance into print. At one point she laments her own romantic streak which led her to reject a marriage proposal from an<blockquote>eminent tradesman &hellip; had I been but worldly enough to have suppressed my want of regard, and to have acted like the modern young ladies, I might now have been driven in a coach and six, instead of driving myself a quill. (Jemmat, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 1.119&#150;20)</blockquote>But elsewhere she suggests something more than financial motives for her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. She is &#145;induc[ed] to &hellip; resigning the needle for the pen&#146; in order &#145;[t]o arraign my words, thoughts, and actions, with the minutest truth, at the tribunal of publick justice&#146;  (ibid., 1.3). Jemmat confesses that her reputation has been irretrievably damaged, but at the end of her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> she is at pains to demonstrate that she has not &#145;act[ed] beneath the dignity of my sex&#146;, and provides evidence from her acquaintances in order to &#145;shew the opinion that every one that knew me had of my father and husband's behaviour&#146;  (ibid., 2.59).<br>
<br>Almost nothing is known of Catherine Jemmat's life beyond the events described in her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. In 1762 the first edition of her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> was published by subscription, with an extensive list of subscribers. A second edition appeared in 1765. Her <span class="italic">Miscellanies, in Prose and Verse</span> was published in 1766, again by subscription. She explains in her introduction that the collection &#145;does not consist wholly of originals&#146;, and includes pieces by friends as well as some previously published material. Modern scholars have been reluctant to ascribe any sections of the <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> to Jemmat herself. Her death was reported in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in November 1766. Two further editions of both her <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> and <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span> appeared in 1771.<br>
