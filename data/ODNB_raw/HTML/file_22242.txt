<span class="headword">Pigot,  David Richard</span>  (1797&#150;1873), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the only son of Dr John Pigot, a physician of high reputation, resident at Kilworth, co. Cork, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nagle. He received his early education at Fermoy, and graduated BA at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1819. For a time he studied medicine in Edinburgh, but he later turned to the legal profession, having entered the Middle Temple, London, in 1818, and he was for a period a pupil of Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal, subsequently chief justice of England. He was called to the bar in Ireland in 1826, and joined the Munster circuit. He married, in 1821, Catherine, eldest daughter of Walter Page of Araglin Mills, co. Cork. There were children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Through his profound legal knowledge and skill in pleading Pigot rapidly acquired an extensive practice. He was made king's counsel in 1835, solicitor-general for Ireland and a bencher of King's Inns in 1839, the elected member of parliament for Clonmel, as a Liberal, on 18 February in the same year, and attorney-general from August 1840 to September 1841. He was re-elected for Clonmel in August 1840 and again in July 1841; and in 1840 he was sworn of the Irish privy council. He was not, however, inspired with political ambition, and hardly ever attended parliament when in opposition. He was made chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland in 1846, in succession to Sir Mazi&egrave;re Brady.<br>
<br>Pigot was a member of the senate of the Queen's University in Ireland, a visitor of Maynooth College, and a commissioner of national education. He was a member of Brooks's, Arthur's, and the Reform clubs in London, and in 1870 he received from Dublin University an honorary DL degree. He served as chief baron until his death at his residence, 15 Merrion Square East, Dublin, on 22 December 1873. He was buried at Kilworth.<br>
<br>Pigot was a most learned and conscientious judge, though he was wont to delve too deeply into the minutiae of litigation, thereby prolonging it quite unnecessarily. Nevertheless, his judgments displayed legal ability of a high order, and some would maintain that even today, a case is all the stronger for having Pigot on one's side. Pigot had a number of interests outside the law and was possessed of great literary and musical ability; he wrote some of the Irish sketches published by Crofton Croker.<br>
