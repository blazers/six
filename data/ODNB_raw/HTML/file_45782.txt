<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burstall,  Sara Annie</span>  (1859&#150;1939), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 2 November 1859. She was the eldest child, and only daughter, of Henry Abraham Burstall and his wife, Annie Hepzibah King. Her father was the Aberdeen agent of a London firm, and was in charge of three granite quarries and the transport of the stone by sea to England. The family were members of the Church of England and attended what was called the English Chapel because the episcopal churches in Scotland were not then unified. In 1871 Henry Burstall was made redundant and returned with his family to London, where he tried to set himself up as a house builder; but he gave up the business in the late 1870s when he inherited a family legacy. His wife came from a Devon family, and was described by her daughter as an independent woman who had been involved with the Chartist movement, and had attended lectures on hygiene at one of the first mechanics' institutes to provide classes for women. Sara Burstall's two brothers were apprenticed to a firm of marine engineers in London and attended night school to gain engineering qualifications.<br>
<br>The family was relatively poor after 1871, and Sara Burstall's educational success was based on winning scholarships. In her early years she had a governess and then attended Dr Lyon's Union Street Scottish Academy in Aberdeen, a mixed school. In London she went to Camden School for Girls, the lower-middle-class school founded by Frances Mary Buss for families unable to pay the fees at the North London Collegiate School. At Camden, where Emma J. Elford was headmistress, she was taught divinity, arithmetic, English, history, geography, and French, and a limited amount of Latin in her final year. At fifteen she took the Cambridge junior local examinations, and did so well that she won a scholarship to the North London Collegiate School, which she entered in 1875; Miss Buss was the headmistress of the school she had founded. Here Sara Burstall specialized in mathematics (well taught by Sophie Bryant), and became the joint head girl with Charlotte Angas Scott. In 1878, she sat the London University's general examination for women, and won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge. There were only six students in her year, including Hertha Marks (later Ayrton). They were the generation who started the Girton College fire brigade, which was lampooned by <span class="italic">Punch</span> but which was an entirely sensible response to the college's geographical isolation. She read for the mathematical tripos although she wanted to change to history; the college insisted she continue with maths, and presented her for the last winter tripos in 1881&#150;2. She reports that she had lost motivation, was stale, and &#145;just lost my First&#146;; but she received a letter of commiseration from Emily Davies.<br>
<br>In 1882 Sara Burstall returned to the North London Collegiate School as an assistant mistress on a salary of &pound;120 per annum, at the same time attending teacher-training classes under the auspices of the College of Preceptors. Miss Buss encouraged her staff to take the opportunity presented by the opening of London degrees to women in 1878, and Sara Burstall graduated BA in 1884 and obtained a London diploma in divinity in 1886. She began her long career as an activist in teachers' organizations in 1884 when she became involved with the Assistant Mistresses' Association and the Teachers' Guild. In 1888 she set up her own independent household, which she maintained until her retirement. She and a friend rented one of her father's properties and let rooms to other ladies active in education (as teachers or students). In 1893 she travelled to the USA, to attend the world fair in Chicago and to study female education, funded by a travel scholarship from the Gilchrist Education Trust. Her research led to her first book, <span class="italic">The Education of Girls in America</span>, published in 1894. In that same year Miss Buss died and Sophie Bryant became headmistress of North London Collegiate, with Sara Burstall as her deputy.<br>
<br>In 1898, at the age of thirty-eight, Sara Burstall became headmistress of the Manchester High School for Girls, on the retirement of Elizabeth Day who had held the position since the foundation of the school in 1874. Like others of her generation of headmistresses, Sara Burstall was faced with girls who were not academically brilliant, and not enthusiastic to learn classics and mathematics, alongside those who were the potential university entrants, and for whom the pioneer schools had been founded. Secondary education was becoming normal for upper-middle and middle-class girls, but not all of them were scholars. To meet their needs, she designed courses in domestic subjects (cookery, laundry, needlework) and in secretarial skills (bookkeeping, shorthand, and Spanish) to run parallel to the academic courses for the university aspirants. Her phrase for these two groups was &#145;express trains and slow trains&#146;. Her introduction of home management and other domestic subjects into the curriculum for middle-class girls was a retreat from the insistence of the pioneer generation of headmistresses on a strictly academic curriculum. She believed this was necessary in order to attract a substantial number of fee-paying pupils aged over fifteen, and was better suited to many girls' abilities. But the policy was controversial in her own time, and remains so a century later. It was either a sensible adjustment to the interests of non-academic girls or a betrayal of everything feminist educators had spent fifty years campaigning to achieve.<br>
<br>Manchester high school grew and prospered during Sara Burstall's period of office. She was also prominent in other educational activities. In 1903, she became one of three women members of the newly formed education committee of Manchester city council, where she initiated the appointment of a woman inspector of infant schools, and the earmarking for girls of two of the four local-authority university scholarships. In 1907&#150;8, she took sabbatical leave and again visited the USA to do the research for her book <span class="italic">Impressions of American Education in 1908</span>. In 1909, she was elected president of the Association of Headmistresses of Public Secondary Schools (AHM), serving until 1911. During this period of intense debate about the curriculum for girls, the AHM gave evidence to the government consultative committee which produced the <span class="italic">Report on Practical Work in Secondary Schools</span>, and stressed the importance of domestic subjects in the female curriculum.<br>
<br>Sara Burstall regarded the period from 1908 to 1914 as the peak of her career. Depressed by the miseries of the 1914&#150;18 war, and the educational and social changes of the post-war period, she retired from Manchester high school in the school's jubilee year, 1924. In that year she became a magistrate in Manchester, but resigned in 1927, feeling, she said, that married women were better suited to the work. In 1925 she was the first woman to be appointed to a Colonial Office advisory committee, that on native education in Africa. At this period she moved away from Manchester so that she would not impede her successor as headmistress; she lived in Derby before settling in London in 1931. She published her autobiography in 1933. The last of her seven books was a biography of Miss Buss, published in 1938. Sara Burstall died at her home, 46 Stevenage Road, Fulham, in London, on 26 March 1939.<br>
