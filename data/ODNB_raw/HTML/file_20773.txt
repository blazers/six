<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Henry</span>  (1798&#150;1880), <span class="occ">artist and antiquary</span>, was born at Clonmel, co. Tipperary, the only child of Henry O'Neill and his wife, the daughter of Samuel Watson, a bookseller. After the early death of his parents, he was brought up by his paternal aunt Sarah O'Neill, a Dublin haberdasher. His artistic talent was recognized and he attended the Dublin Society school from 1815. The society awarded him a silver medal for &#145;industry and talents&#146; in 1825. From 1835 he exhibited regularly at the Royal Hibernian Academy, of which he became an associate in 1837 but from which he resigned in 1844.<br>
<br>Despite his assertions to the contrary, it was financial need that drove O'Neill to London in 1847; he fared little better in England and joined the army, but his friends bought him out shortly thereafter. He returned to Dublin, and dedicated his life to travelling around the country to record the antiquities of Ireland. He is best known for two books, <span class="italic">The most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">The Fine Arts and Civilisation of Ancient Ireland</span> (1863). Both works collected O'Neill's drawings of the antiquities, while the latter work sought to demonstrate the existence of an advanced civilization in Ireland in prehistoric times, and to refute the conclusions of George Petrie in his <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</span> (1845). O'Neill's argument that the round towers were of pagan origin was soon discredited, and his other arguments did not carry lasting weight.<br>
<br>O'Neill was a member of Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association and wrote a pamphlet attacking landlordism, <span class="italic">Ireland for the Irish</span> (1868). His portrait of O'Connell and his fellow prisoners in Richmond gaol in 1843 was well received. John Ruskin was said to have paid 50 guineas for a small collection of O'Neill's drawings; his 1874 portrait of John Cornelius O'Callaghan, the historian, hangs in the National Gallery in Dublin. He died at 109 Lower Gardiner Street, Dublin, on 21 December 1880, leaving a widow (his second wife) and four children in straitened circumstances.<br>
