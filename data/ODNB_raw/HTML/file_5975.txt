<span class="headword">Colm&aacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [St Colm&aacute;n]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 676), <span class="occ">bishop of Lindisfarne</span>, was an Irish monk from Iona. He may conceivably be the &#145;Colmanus abbas&#146; recorded by the seventeenth-century scholar Patrick Young as the addressee of a charter, now lost, from Wulfhere, king of the Mercians (<i>r</i>. 657&#150;74), preserved in the archive of Worcester Cathedral (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1822). If so, he held ecclesiastical office in Mercia about the same time as the first two bishops of the Mercians, Diuma and Ceollach, both of whom were Irishmen. However, the charter reference is by no means reliable, and in any case Colm&aacute;n is one of the most common early medieval Irish names.<br>
<br>On the death of Fin&aacute;n in 661, Colm&aacute;n succeeded him as abbot of Lindisfarne and bishop of the Northumbrians. His appointment coincided with, and may have exacerbated, intensifying disagreements in the Northumbrian church between those who followed the customs of Iona and its dependencies (generally labelled, inaccurately, as the &#145;Irish&#146; tradition), and those who followed practices current in northern Italy and Merovingian Francia (usually equally inaccurately termed the &#145;Roman&#146; tradition). The fullest coverage of the dispute is given by Bede, whose <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>, completed in 731, pays most attention to the conflict over the method of calculating the date of Easter, the central festival in the Christian calendar. The practice characterized as Roman was based on a system first devised at Alexandria centuries earlier, which placed Easter on a Sunday between the end of the fourteenth and the twenty-first days of the lunar month after the vernal equinox, avoiding the Jewish passover festival on the fourteenth of that month. The &#145;Irish&#146; system put Easter between the fourteenth and the twentieth days: thus the &#145;Irish&#146; Easter Sunday would sometimes fall earlier than the &#145;Roman&#146; one. Further dislocation was caused by the use of different cycles of years designed to reconcile the lunar calendar with the solar months of the Roman calendar: the Alexandrian system was based on a ninety-five-year cycle, the Irish on one of eighty-four years, derived from a treatise attributed (wrongly, as it turns out) to a third-century bishop. Another point of contention was the method of tonsuring monks: Roman practice left a circle of hair around a shaven crown (in imitation of the crown of thorns), while the Irish shaved the hair at the front, leaving it long at the back.<br>
<br>Controversy between the two sides culminated at a synod convened at Streanaeshalch (Whitby) in 664. Bede's account of this event is likely to have been coloured by his own prejudices: adherence to the Roman practice, but also considerable respect for the asceticism of the monks of the Ionan tradition, and, perhaps, a dislike of the Roman side's spokesman Wilfrid. Bede includes a rose-tinted passage evoking the virtues of the Irish way of monasticism, its frugality and austerity, and the respect it elicited from the Northumbrians, both king and people, and implicitly contrasts it with the monasticism of his own time, which he saw as corrupted by secular influence. His report of the synod is animated by the distinction he draws between Colm&aacute;n's measured exposition of his case and Wilfrid's learned but high-handed, if not insulting, responses (at one point he called the Irish adherents <i>stultus</i>&#151;&#145;stupid&#146;). The synod began with the king of the Northumbrians, Oswiu, asking Colm&aacute;n to describe the origins of his customs. Colm&aacute;n said that &#145;all our fathers&#146; had celebrated Easter in the way that he did, and he invoked the example of St John the Evangelist  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.25). Wilfrid explained that St John had followed Jewish law &#145;when the church was still Jewish in many respects&#146;  (ibid.), but that the example to be preferred was that of St Peter who, he wrongly claimed, had celebrated Easter at Rome on the Sunday following the fourteenth day of the lunar month. Colm&aacute;n posited the counter-examples of the third-century bishop Anatolius, whose calculations his tradition followed, and of Iona's founder, St Columba. Wilfrid stated that the Irish had misinterpreted Anatolius, and that Columba had acted through ignorance. He again invoked the example of St Peter, to whom Christ had given the keys to the kingdom of heaven, and King Oswiu asked Colm&aacute;n if there was anything to show that an equal authority had been granted to &#145;your Columba&#146;  (ibid.). When the bishop admitted that there was not, Oswiu declared that he intended to obey the commands of the door-keeper of heaven, and the matter was decided in favour of the &#145;Roman&#146; usage.<br>
<br>While Bede relates that all those present at the synod gave their assent to Oswiu's ruling, it is evident that Colm&aacute;n dissented, for he left Northumbria soon after. It is less clear that he rejected the decision &#145;for fear of his fellow-countrymen&#146;, as Wilfrid's biographer Stephen of Ripon asserts  (<span class="italic">Life of Bishop Wilfrid</span>, 23): the implication that only threats from others prevented Colm&aacute;n from accepting the rightness of Wilfrid's case looks like special pleading on the part of the hagiographer. Colm&aacute;n took with him all those who could not accept the decision, together with some of the relics of St &Aacute;ed&aacute;n. Before leaving he won from Oswiu&#151;who admired Colm&aacute;n's &#145;innate wisdom&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 3.26)&#151;the favour that Abbot Eata of Melrose should be appointed the new leader of the Lindisfarne community. Colm&aacute;n's replacement as bishop of the Northumbrians was Tuda, a monk from the southern part of Ireland, where the Roman customs were followed. Tuda, however, lasted only a short time, and was succeeded as bishop by Eata.<br>
<br>Colm&aacute;n travelled first to Iona, and thence to an island off the west coast of Ireland, Inishbofin (&#145;the island of the white cow&#146;), where he founded a new community of both Irish and English monks. Dissension soon arose, however:<blockquote>because the Irish, in summer time when the harvest had to be gathered in, left the monastery and wandered about, scattering into various places with which they were familiar; then when winter came, they returned and expected to have a share in the things which the English had provided. (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.4)</blockquote>Colm&aacute;n therefore moved the English monks to a new foundation on the Irish mainland at Mayo. By Bede's time this community was flourishing, and he reports that the monks had &#145;adopted a better Rule&#146;&#151;perhaps meaning that they had abandoned the Ionan method of Easter calculation and custom of tonsure, as well as that they were living more according to Benedictine precepts, under a canonically elected abbot.<br>
<br>Entries in the annals of Ulster and other Irish annals (in which he is given the title bishop of Inishbofin) date Colm&aacute;n's death to 676. Irish martyrologies commemorate him on 8 August.<br>
