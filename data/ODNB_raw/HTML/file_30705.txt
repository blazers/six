<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benn,  William Wedgwood</span>, first Viscount Stansgate  (1877&#150;1960), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 10 May 1877 at Hackney, London, a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58236/', "Sir John Williams Benn, first baronet (1850&#150;1922)")</script>, publisher and politician, and his wife, Elizabeth Pickstone (<i>d</i>. 1928). His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30704/', "Sir Ernest John Pickstone Benn")</script>, the publisher and libertarian. William Wedgwood Benn was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet, Paris, and at University College, London, where he obtained a first in French (1898) and later became a fellow (1918). He worked for some years in his father's publishing business. Deeply influenced by social conditions in the East End of London, and associated with the London Progressive Party, of which his father was leader within the London county council, Benn was a lifelong radical nonconformist. He was soon adopted as Liberal candidate for his father's former seat of St George's, Tower Hamlets, and became a member at the general election of 1906. He gained experience at the Treasury, Board of Education, and Admiralty as parliamentary private secretary to Reginald McKenna. After retaining his seat at both general elections in 1910, Benn became a junior lord of the Treasury and a singularly active politician, serving as Liberal whip for 1910&#150;15. In 1912 he successfully organized relief of suffering during the dock strike and two years later, when war broke out, he became chairman of the organizing committee of the National Relief Fund.<br>
<br>In October, when over &pound;2 million had already been raised, Benn answered an inner call and resigned this post to apply for active service. Despite his short stature, he secured a commission in the Middlesex yeomanry. He took part in the fierce fighting on the heights above Suvla Bay in August 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign, and later became an observer with the Royal Naval Air Service; he participated in the pinpoint bombing of the Baghdad railway. Among his other exploits was to be rescued from a sinking aeroplane in the Mediterranean, and to be aboard an improvised aircraft-carrier sunk by shore batteries at Castelorizo. He also commanded a party of French sailors in guerrilla activities against the Turks and served in authorized privateering in the Red Sea, before returning to Britain to qualify as a pilot.<br>
<br>After refusing the office of chief whip from the hand of Lloyd George, Benn returned to service in Italy and was eventually seconded to the Italian army to organize and participate in the first parachute landing of a secret service agent behind the enemy lines. His distinguished war record was recognized with many honours: he was twice mentioned in dispatches, appointed to the DSO, awarded the DFC, was made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, received the Croix de Guerre, the Italian war cross, and the Italian bronze medal for valour. He later published an account of his wartime experiences, which was modestly entitled <span class="italic">In the Side Shows</span> (1919). On 17 November 1920 he married Margaret Eadie (1897&#150;1991) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50714/', "Benn, Margaret Eadie Wedgwood")</script>], daughter of Daniel Turner Holmes, Liberal member for Govan, Lanarkshire, from 1911 to 1918. There were four sons of the marriage, of whom the youngest died at birth.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1918, his former constituency having been redistributed, Benn was returned as member for Leith, a seat which he held through three more general elections and for nine years of intense parliamentary activity. A supporter of Asquith just this side of idolatry, Benn chafed under the leadership of Lloyd George. He found himself increasingly voting with the Labour Party, applied for membership of that party in 1927, and resigned his seat. The next year he was returned at a by-election as member for North Aberdeen, and held the seat in the general election of 1929. His transfer of allegiance had proved timely, and in Ramsay MacDonald's second administration he became secretary of state for India with a seat in the cabinet, and was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Benn occupied this high, but exposed, position for the next two years under fairly constant attack. The controversial political trial at Meerut, of Indian communists accused of a &#145;conspiracy&#146; against the government, was about to commence, having been authorized by his predecessor. And the report of the Indian statutory commission under Sir John Simon, published in June 1930, was in course of preparation. Against this background Benn authorized the viceroy, in October 1929, to make the historic declaration that the legitimate goal of Indian aspirations was dominion status. Simon's concurrence was not obtained and a short but bitter parliamentary debate ensued, in which Benn defended his action with courage. When Lloyd George denounced him as a &#145;pocket edition of Moses&#146; he retorted, &#145;But I never worshipped the golden calf&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 231, 1929, 1321). In 1930 the Indian leader M. K. Gandhi initiated a successful campaign of civil disobedience, directed against the salt tax, and Benn ultimately felt compelled to order his arrest. Gandhi was released the following year for talks with the viceroy which resulted in the Delhi pact, but by the time he arrived in London for the second round-table conference, Benn was out of office. On the formation of the &#145;national&#146; government in August 1931 he had remained loyal to the Labour Party, and was decisively defeated at the ensuing general election. He was again defeated in November 1935 as a candidate for Dudley.<br>
<br>Benn used this period of enforced parliamentary inactivity to make, with his wife, a journey round the world by almost every known means of transport: an extensive visit to the United States was followed by travels through the Far East, Japan, Mongolia, Siberia, and Moscow.<br>
<br>At a by-election in 1937 Benn was returned as member for the Gorton division of Manchester. On the outbreak of war in 1939 he enlisted as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, where he rose to the rank of air commodore. He was again mentioned in dispatches, and though officially grounded was known to have taken part in air operations. In January 1942 he was called to the House of Lords as first Viscount Stansgate: the peerage was expressly granted to strengthen Labour representation in the upper house. He was vice-president of the Allied Control Commission in Italy, 1943&#150;4.<br>
<br>In the Labour government of 1945 Stansgate became secretary of state for air. The following year he was entrusted by the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, with the conduct in Cairo of the abortive negotiations for a revision of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. Later that year, however, Stansgate, who was nearly seventy, was one of a number of older ministers dropped from the government to make way for younger blood.<br>
<br>In 1947 Stansgate became president of the inter-parliamentary union, and he held this position for ten years with universal esteem. In the House of Lords he became the authentic voice of liberalism. His persistence might cause temporary annoyance, and once Lord Hailsham carried a motion that &#145;the noble lord be no longer heard&#146;, but Stansgate's patent sincerity, his complete freedom from malice, and his natural modesty of manner, made many admirers. While his perpetual effervescence, buoyancy, and wit conveyed an impression of the gay cavalier, &#145;Wedgy Benn&#146; was really the happy warrior, a man of profound ethical conviction, with a great love for his fellow human beings.<br>
<br>Stansgate was taken ill in the Palace of Westminster on 16 November 1960 while waiting to speak. He had closed the previous day's proceedings with some brief observations on the importance of continued friendship with India. He was taken to Westminster Hospital, where he died on 17 November 1960. His eldest son, a flight lieutenant who was awarded the DFC, had died in 1944 of injuries received in action. His second son, Anthony Neil Wedgwood (Tony) Benn (<i>b</i>. 1925), was elected Labour member for Bristol South East in 1950. Though he sought to renounce the succession, he was held to be disqualified from the Commons after his father's death. He headed the poll at the ensuing by-election in May 1961 but was again ruled disqualified, and so began a protest that resulted in the 1963 <span class="roman">Peerage Act</span>, which made possible the renunciation of a hereditary peerage. Having duly disclaimed his title, Benn was returned for Bristol South East in August 1963. He went on to become postmaster-general in the Labour government of 1964, entered the cabinet as minister of technology in 1966, and was a candidate for the Labour leadership in 1976 and 1988. The viscountcy remained in abeyance.<br>
