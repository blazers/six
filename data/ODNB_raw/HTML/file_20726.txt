<span class="headword">Oliver,  John</span>  (1616/17&#150;1701), <span class="occ">glass painter and master mason</span>, who was born presumably in London, was supposed to have been related to the miniature painters Isaac and Peter Oliver and to John Oliver, master mason to James I, but there is no known evidence to support this assertion recorded in Redgrave  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 301). A panel formerly at Christ Church, Oxford, <span class="italic">St Peter Delivered from Prison</span> (lost), inscribed &#145;J. Oliver, aetat. suae lxxxiv, anno 1700&#146;, establishes the year of his birth as 1616 or 1617.<br>
<br>Glass painting appears to have been Oliver's trade, as a small legacy to the Glaziers' Company in his will suggests, and most of his glass seems to have been heraldic work, a feature typical of post-Restoration England. The extant window at Northill, Bedfordshire (<i>c</i>.1664), showing the arms of the Grocers' Company, with royal arms, is on a monumental scale, painted in enamel colours, similar to the works of Henry Gyles. Other recorded works include sundials at the Northill rectory and Lambeth Palace and armorial panels at Petworth, Sussex (lost?). Oliver also held the office of master mason to the crown from 1685/6. He was involved as a surveyor in the rebuilding of the City of London from 1667. He is frequently mentioned in connection with the rebuilding of the City's churches. He seems to have been resident in the parish of St Michael Queenhithe. Most of his architectural works appear to have been carried out for City companies (for example the Mercers' hall and chapel, after 1668) and Christ's Hospital (from 1673), of which he was a governor.<br>
<br>Oliver was also active as a cartographer and was the author of <span class="italic">A mapp of the cityes of London &amp; Westminster &amp; burrough of Southwark, with their suburbs as it is now rebuilt since the late dreadfull fire</span> (<i>c</i>.1680). He is recorded to have been in possession of Inigo Jones's papers and drawings  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.10). He died, presumably in London, before 18 November 1701, when his will was proved. In this he made provision for his wife, Susanna, his daughter Grace Shaw, and his son-in-law George Seagood and for his burial in St Paul's Cathedral. He also left a small legacy to the Glaziers' Company, and money for an annual dinner of roast meat for the boys of Christ's Hospital.<br>
