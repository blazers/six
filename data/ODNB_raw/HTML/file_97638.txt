<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bedford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> von Schoenebeck]</span>,  Sybille</span>  (1911&#150;2006), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 March 1911 at Charlottenburg, on the outskirts of Berlin, Germany, the second daughter of Maximilian Josef von Schoenebeck (1863&#150;1925) and only child of his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bernhardt. Her father was descended from a long line of bureaucrats and minor landed gentry; his father, August von Schoenebeck, was a judge, both of whose sons entered the army. Maximilian von Schoenebeck's first wife, Melanie Herz, died in 1905, leaving a daughter, Maximiliana Henrietta, born in 1899. His second marriage, in 1910, enabled him to buy a small estate at Feldkirch in Baden, south Germany, and it was there that Sybille spent her childhood. Her half-Jewish mother was a Catholic convert, and Sybille was brought up in the Roman faith, educated somewhat haphazardly at home and for a brief period at a nearby Ursuline convent.<br>
<br>As her mother was frequently absent, absorbed in a series of glamorous love affairs, Sybille von Schoenebeck was left mainly in the care of her father. It was from him that she imbibed a knowledge and love of food and wine that lasted a lifetime. Her parents divorced in 1921, and four years later her father died, consigning her to the care of her mother and of an Italian stepfather, an architect, Norberto Marchesani. For the next few years this threesome travelled through Italy, with Sybille at intervals dispatched to England to continue her education. It was while attending hearings at the law courts in the Strand that she first became fascinated by the judicial process, the subject of much of her non-fiction writing.<br>
<br>The family finally settled in Sanary sur mer in the south of France, and there Sybille met the novelist and philosopher Aldous Huxley and his wife, Maria Nys, &#145;the two people I owe most to,&#146; she wrote, &#145;who educated me morally [and] intellectually&#146;  (<span class="italic">Quicksands</span>, 18). She later completed an acclaimed two-volume biography of Huxley, published in 1973&#150;4. At Sanary, too, she came to know a number of English writers, among them Cyril Connolly and Brian Howard, and was drawn into a circle of German refugee intellectuals, forming a particular friendship with the children of Thomas Mann, Klaus and Erika. In 1933 she contributed an article to Klaus Mann's magazine, <span class="italic">Die Sammlung</span>, criticizing the Nazi regime, and this, together with the discovery by the German authorities of her Jewish ancestry, led to her bank account being frozen. Aware of the danger of her situation, she left for London, where the Huxleys helped to arrange a marriage of convenience to a club attendant sixteen years her senior, Walter Croan, otherwise Walter Bedford. They married at Westminster register office on 15 November 1935, with Aldous Huxley as a witness. Although the union was quickly dissolved, it had crucially conferred not only a British passport but the name by which Sybille Bedford became known to generations of readers.<br>
<br>Although her mother had by this time died, Sybille Bedford returned to France, remaining until 1940 when she left for California, scraping a living as a secretary, journalist, and translator. After the war she spent a year travelling in Mexico before moving to Rome. Determined to pursue a literary career, she was much encouraged by two writer friends, Martha Gellhorn and Allanah Harper, the latter supporting the almost penniless Bedford with a small income. Fluent in four languages, she chose to write in English, the rope that saved her, as she put it, &#145;from drifting awash in the fluidities of multi-lingualism that surrounded me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jigsaw</span>, 70). In 1953 she published her first book, <span class="italic">The Sudden View: a Mexican Journey</span>, later reissued as <span class="italic">A Visit to Don Otavio</span>, widely regarded as a classic of travel literature. This was followed in 1956 by a novel, <span class="italic">A Legacy</span>, the first stage in a journey of imaginative autobiography culminating in 1989 in her penultimate work, <span class="italic">Jigsaw</span>. <span class="italic">A Legacy</span> was widely acclaimed, Evelyn Waugh referring to its author as &#145;a new writer of remarkable accomplishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 13 April 1956). There were further novels, <span class="italic">A Favourite of the Gods</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">A Compass Error</span> (1968), as well as four works of non-fiction: <span class="italic">The Best We Can Do</span> (1958), an account of the murder trial of Bodkin Adams, <span class="italic">The Faces of Justice</span> (1961), describing proceedings in European courts of law, and two volumes of collected articles, <span class="italic">As It Was</span> (1990) and <span class="italic">Pleasures and Landscapes</span> (2003). Her last book, <span class="italic">Quicksands</span> (2005), was a remarkable if elusive work of autobiography, dedicated to her long-term companion and executor, Aliette Martin.<br>
<br>For over thirty years Bedford led a peripatetic existence until in 1979 she made a permanent home in Chelsea, London. She was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a vice-president of PEN, appointed OBE in 1981, and elected a companion of literature in 1994. Small and slender, with an almost heroic disregard for personal adornment, she had a mesmerizing personality and was intensely curious, fiercely intelligent, prone to frightful anxieties, and endowed with enormous kindness, sensitivity, and charm. She conducted several intense love affairs, one with a married woman in Rome, Evelyn Gendel, and for twenty years with the American novelist, Eda Lord. Despite tormenting difficulties with her eyesight, she was a dedicated writer, who brought to all her work a great sensitivity, a supremely elegant style, and an incorruptible morality. She died at the Lister Hospital, London, on 17 February 2006 and was cremated at Mortlake crematorium ten days later. A memorial meeting was held at the Reform Club, Pall Mall, on 5 June 2006.<br>
