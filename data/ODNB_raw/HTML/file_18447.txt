<span class="headword">Mayne,  William</span>  (1818&#150;1855), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 28 October 1818, the second surviving son of the Revd Robert Mayne of Limpsfield, Surrey, and his wife, Charlotte Cuninghame Graham, daughter of Colonel Graham of St Lawrence House, near Canterbury. William Mayne, Baron Newhaven, was his father's brother. He attended Addiscombe College in 1836 and 1837, and was appointed ensign on 15 December 1837, serving with the 4th and later the 49th Bengal native infantry.<br>
<br>In November 1838 Mayne was appointed to serve in the invasion of Afghanistan by the army of the Indus, and was appointed detachment adjutant to the detachments of the 27th and 37th Bengal infantry. He distinguished himself at the unsuccessful attack on the fort of Jalgah on 3 October 1840, and became lieutenant on 2 November 1841. As lieutenant in command of a <i>ressalah</i> (squadron) of the 2nd Shah Shuja's irregular cavalry, or Anderson's Horse, he fought in various actions under Brigadier John Shelton and Sir Robert Sale. He went with Sale's brigade to Jalalabad, where he distinguished himself in the siege and was mentioned in dispatches. Following General Pollock's relief of Jalalabad he served with his quartermaster-general's department and at the capture of Istalif on 29 September 1842 by Major-General McCaskill's division. Lord Ellenborough, who favoured the &#145;illustrious garrison&#146; of Jalalabad, praised Mayne and appointed him adjutant of the governor-general's bodyguard. While second in command of it he had a horse killed under him at Maharajpur on 31 December 1843. He was not engaged in the Anglo-Sikh wars, being in command of the 5th irregular horse at Bhawanipur during the first war, and commandant of Lord Dalhousie's bodyguard at the time of the second. In 1844 Mayne married Helen Cunliffe, daughter of Thomas Reed Davidson, Bengal civil service, and niece of Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Cunliffe.<br>
<br>In 1851, while still a captain in the 37th Bengal infantry, Mayne was selected by Lord Dalhousie to command the Hyderabad contingent of the nizam's forces, and retained this command until his death. With 6000 of these troops he suppressed disturbances in the Deccan. The rapidity of his marches and the success of his operations attracted favourable notice. He was repeatedly thanked by the governor-general in council, particularly for the defeat of a large force of Arabs near Aurangabad on 20 September 1853 and for his conduct on 22 September 1854 when, while besieging the fort of Saila, near Hyderabad, he charged and annihilated a force of Rohillas, who sallied out at night.<br>
<br>On his return to England at the close of 1854 Mayne was made a brevet colonel and aide-de-camp to the queen. He had just returned to India when an attack of dysentery sent him home again. He died at Cairo on 23 December 1855, survived by his wife and one son.<br>
