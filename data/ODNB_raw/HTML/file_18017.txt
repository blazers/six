<span class="headword">Maplet,  John</span>  (1611<span class="mult">x</span>15&#150;1670), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in the parish of St Martin's-le-Grand, London, was the son of John Maplet, a shoemaker. He was educated at Westminster School, and in 1630 he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford; he claimed to be twenty in 1632, when he matriculated. He graduated BA on 8 July 1634, MA on 17 April 1638, and DM on 24 July 1647. On 9 December 1643 he was elected junior proctor on the death of William Cartwright, and served for the remainder of the year, and in the autumn of 1647 he was nominated principal of Gloucester Hall. He was a delegate of the university appointed to receive the parliamentary visitors, and is said to have submitted to their authority, but he quickly left the university.<br>
<br>About 1648 Maplet became tutor to Lucius Cary, third Viscount Falkland, with whom he travelled in France for two years, staying chiefly at Orl&eacute;ans, Blois, and Saumur. During the tour he made many observations, which he committed to writing, &#145;in a neat and curious hand, with a particular tract of his travels in an elegant Latin style&#146;  (Guidott, 181). He afterwards went with Henry Cary, Lord Falkland, brother of Lucius, to the Low Countries, where an uncle of his seems to have lived. On 5 March 1651 it was certified to the committee for reformation of the universities that he was &#145;absent upon leave&#146;  (Burrows, 329), but while still abroad he appears to have been ejected from his offices at Oxford.<br>
<br>On his return Maplet settled as a physician at Bath, practising there in the summer and at Bristol in the winter &#145;with great respect and veneration from all people in those parts&#146;. He may have returned to Oxford at some point, as a poem by J. Maplet, a doctor at Christ Church, appeared in <span class="italic">Musarum Oxoniensium elaiophoria</span> (1654). About that time he married Mrs Anne Hull of Bristol. He was acquainted with the leading physicians of his time, and helped Thomas Guidott in his early days. At the Restoration he resumed the principalship of Gloucester Hall, but retired in 1662. He died at Bath on 4 August 1670, said to be aged fifty-five. In the north aisle of Bath Abbey, where they were buried, Guidott erected an elaborate monument, with a black marble tablet bearing a Latin inscription to Maplet's memory. Under it is another small tablet with an inscription to his wife, who died in February 1671, aged thirty-five, and his children, a son John, aged three years, and a daughter Mary, aged three months. Of Maplet, Guidott says: &#145;He was of a tender, brittle constitution, inclining to feminine, clear skinn'd and of a very fresh complexion&#146;  (Guidott, 152). Wood says, &#145;he was learned, candid, and ingenious, a good physician, a better Christian, and an excellent Latin poet&#146;.<br>
<br>Maplet left a number of works in manuscript, including the account of his foreign travels. In 1694 Guidott published Maplet's <span class="italic">Epistolarum medicarum specimen de thermarum Bathoniensium effectis</span>, which was dedicated to the leading contemporary physicians. Guidott also transcribed some Latin verses by Maplet on catarrh in the eyes, and some lines headed &#145;De catarrhi fuga&#146; and &#145;In primum canitiem&#146;, with a rhymed translation of the latter. He considered Maplet's &#145;style terse, his words choice, but his periods a little too elaborate&#146;  (Guidott, 193).<br>
