<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Price,  Bonamy</span>  (1807&#150;1888), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born at St Peter Port, Guernsey, on 22 May 1807, the eldest son of Frederick Price and his wife, Maria Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vardon. At the age of fourteen he was sent as a private pupil to the Revd Charles Bradley of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, where W. Smith O'Brien was one of his fellow pupils. He matriculated at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1825, graduating BA with a double first in classics and mathematics in 1829, and proceeding MA in 1832. While he was an undergraduate at Oxford he was an occasional pupil of Thomas Arnold at Laleham, and formed a friendship with F. W. Newman, his brother John Henry Newman, and other leaders of the Tractarian movement.<br>
<br>In 1830 Arnold, then headmaster of Rugby, offered him the mathematical mastership at that school. In 1832 Price was appointed to a classical mastership, and given charge of a division of the fifth form. He married in Rugby, on 18 December 1834, Lydia (1811/12&#150;1891), the daughter of Joseph Rose, vicar of Rothley, and granddaughter of Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire. In 1838 he succeeded Prince Lee in charge of the form in Rugby known as the Twenty. He retained this post under A. C. Tait, Arnold's successor, but resigned in 1850, shortly after Tait's appointment to the deanery of Carlisle. Like Tait, he was a proponent of university reform: he was one of the movers of a petition in 1847 for a royal commission, and in 1850 published proposals for reorganizing Oxford on German professional lines. He became identified with strong broad-church views, inspired by German theology, and he attacked &#145;Anglo-Catholic theory&#146; in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (1851).<br>
<br>An unsuccessful candidate in 1851 for the Greek chair at Edinburgh, Price lived in London from 1850 to 1868, devoting himself to business affairs. He suffered for some months from a cerebral illness, but completely recovered. He served on the royal commissions on Scottish fisheries (1856), which protected the position of herring fishermen on the east coast of Scotland, and on the queen's colleges in Ireland (1857).<br>
<br>When the Drummond professorship of political economy at Oxford, to which elections were made for a term of five years, became vacant in 1868, Price was elected by convocation by a large majority over the former holder of the office, J. E. Thorold Rogers, who offered himself for re-election. Rogers had offended the conservative majority of convocation. Price occupied the chair until his death, being thrice re-elected. He zealously devoted himself to his professorial duties. Master of a clear and incisive style, he lectured with comparative success. Courageous in the expression of his views, fond of controversy, though kindly in his treatment of opponents, he exercised a stimulating influence on his pupils. Prince Leopold of Belgium, while resident in Oxford, frequently attended his lectures, and became much attached to him.<br>
<br>Price also lectured in different parts of the country in connection with the movement for the higher education of women, and was a prolific writer for periodicals, contributing nearly fifty articles to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, and the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> between 1862 and 1882. He served on the duke of Richmond's commission on agriculture (1879&#150;82) and on Lord Iddesleigh's commission on the depression of trade (1885&#150;6), on which he made a spirited defence of old-style <i>laissez-faire</i>. At Cheltenham in 1878, and at Nottingham in 1882, he was president of the economical section of the Social Science Association. He was made an honorary LLD by Edinburgh University in 1881 and in 1883 he was elected honorary fellow of Worcester College. He died at his London home, 29 Michael's Grove, Brompton, on 8 January 1888 and was buried in Paddington cemetery. His wife and five daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Price possessed in a high degree the qualities of a successful schoolmaster. His power as an economist lay in exposition and criticism, not in original work. He made no important contribution to economic science, though he published <span class="italic">The Principles of Currency</span> (1869), <span class="italic">Currency and Banking</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Chapters on Practical Political Economy</span> (1878). By the 1880s he seemed a rather old-fashioned exponent of the more simplistic aspects of Ricardian free trade. In his speech on the <span class="roman">Land Law (Ireland) Bill</span> on 7 April 1881 W. E. Gladstone referred to him, in connection with the duke of Richmond's commission, as:<blockquote>the only man&#151;to his credit be it spoken&#151;who has had the resolution to apply, in all their unmitigated authority, the principles of abstract political economy to the people and circumstances of Ireland, exactly as if he had been proposing to legislate for the inhabitants of Saturn or Jupiter. (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 260, 1881, 895)</blockquote>
