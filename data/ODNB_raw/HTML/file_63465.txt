<span class="headword">Temple,  Charles Lindsay</span>  (1871&#150;1929), <span class="occ">colonial official and author</span>, was born on 20 November 1871 at Simla, India, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36452/', "Sir Richard Temple, bt (1826&#150;1902)")</script>, administrator in India, and his second wife, Mary Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1924), daughter of Charles Robert Lindsay of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Rhoda Charlotte. Temple was connected through his immediate family, and his mother's relationship with the earls of Crawford, to the intellectual, social, and political &eacute;lite of the period. After attending Sedbergh School (1882&#150;9) he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1890 to read engineering but left the following year due to recurring bouts of ill health. In spite of considerable intellectual ability he abandoned a university career, instead joining the Hampstead literary set where he developed his linguistic and anthropological interests. Finding no lasting satisfaction there, he decided to seek his fortune in Brazil. Between 1893 and 1896 he rapidly learnt Portuguese, travelled, traded, and ran his own coffee plantation in Cuyaba. Dissatisfied with limited success, he travelled to London, gaining a Royal Geographical Society diploma in surveying in 1896 before returning to Brazil in the hope of building a major road between Para and Cuyaba. Thwarted by the vacillation of the local authorities he gave up this plan, gained a post with the consular service, and served in Para and Manaos (1898&#150;1901).<br>
<br>In August 1901, seeking faster promotion, Temple transferred to the colonial service. Because of the reputation he had built in Brazil, he was appointed to the newly formed political service for Northern Nigeria as a third-class resident&#151;higher than the normal starting rank of assistant resident. Between 1901 and 1910 he enhanced his reputation through exceptional work as resident-in-charge of the important provinces of Bauchi, Sokoto, and Kano, as well as becoming chief examiner in the Hausa language. Following his services to the Northern Nigerian lands committee, Temple was made a CMG in 1909. In 1910 he was appointed chief secretary with a dormant commission to administer the protectorate in the absence of the governor. Temple acted, with great success, as governor from January to August 1911 and from June to October 1912. Following the amalgamation of Nigeria in January 1914, he served under Sir Frederick Lugard, the governor-general, as lieutenant-governor of the northern provinces, and held this office until his retirement due to ill health in 1917.<br>
<br>Temple's wife, Olive Susan Miranda MacLeod (1880&#150;1936) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63622/', "Temple, Olive Susan Miranda")</script>], whom he had married on 28 April 1912, shared his sense of adventure and his intellectual interests. Olive went on tour with Charles, taking an active interest in his administrative and anthropological activities. They both wrote books and articles on Nigeria as well as making photographic and phonographic recordings of the local communities, presenting useful collections to the Royal Geographical Society and to the social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer.<br>
<br>As one of the most able administrators of the first two decades of British control in Northern Nigeria, Temple had an important influence on the formative years of indirect rule. He frequently had fierce clashes with Lugard over the application of this policy, particularly objecting to Lugard's capricious style of administration which he felt undermined hard won reforms. Early accounts of Temple are largely critical but subsequently available sources have led to a reassessment of his significance to the colonial history of Nigeria. Of these sources, his wife's papers, which give a particularly detailed and vivid account of Temple's time in Nigeria, make clear that he was a very ambitious man determined to make a name for himself as a liberal, scientific, and modern administrator. Other contemporary accounts demonstrate that he largely achieved this, and would have been appointed governor of Uganda in 1917 had ill health not intervened. During Charles's sick leave (from 1916) and recuperation the Temples stayed in Cape Province, and it was here that he wrote <span class="italic">Native Races and their Rulers</span> (1918). In this book Temple explained and justified his conception of indirect rule from the basis of a social Darwinist world-view, as well as making a satirical and cryptic attack on Lugard's style of administration. Finding South Africa uncongenial, the Temples moved to Granada, Spain, where they remained until Charles died of kidney failure on 9 January 1929. He was buried in Granada.<br>
