<span class="headword">Waller,  Horace</span>  (1833&#150;1896), <span class="occ">missionary and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born in Tavistock Square, London, on 16 February 1833, the first son of six children of John Waller (<i>c</i>.1791&#150;1865), stockbroker, and his wife, Mary Ann. He had three brothers and two sisters. From 1840 to May 1846 he attended Eagle House School, Brook Green, in Hammersmith, run by Dr Wickham, and spent his early years in Walthamstow, Essex, learning a love for country sports which continued throughout his life. He apprenticed as a stockbroker, growing up lanky and 6 feet tall with a long beard. At Whitsuntide 1859 a new sense of religious dedication led Waller, an evangelical Anglican, to join the first Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA). By October 1860 he was a lay missionary bound for Nyasaland. He spent three years there supervising supplies, helping fight Yao slave raiders, and becoming friends with David Livingstone and John Kirk. He left the mission in protest when its second leader, Bishop William George Tozer, decided to keep only the boys of the mission, who had been rescued along with women and girls in 1861 by Bishop Charles Frederick Mackenzie (<i>d</i>. 31 Jan 1862). Convinced that the women and girls would be re-enslaved if left in Nyasaland, he took them to Cape Town. In 1864 he was elected FRGS.<br>
<br>In 1865, a year after Waller's return home, his father died, leaving Waller to support the family. He divided his time, applying for business ventures and government posts and aiding Livingstone, who was writing a book on his Zambezi travels. By 1867 he found his vocation in the church. False rumours of Livingstone's death in Africa that year made Waller's African experiences and his letters from Kirk, then vice-consul in Zanzibar, valuable to geographical and humanitarian circles. In August 1867 he spoke at an international anti-slavery convention in Paris; and in December, through Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, president of the UMCA (Waller's missionary experience being accepted in lieu of educational requirements), he was ordained deacon, and in 1868 priest. He was curate of St John's, Chatham (1867&#150;70), vicar of St John's, Leytonstone, Essex (1870&#150;74), and rector of Twywell, near Thrapston, Northamptonshire (1874&#150;95). This career enabled him to earn a living, to focus on religion and Africa, and on 13 April 1869 to marry Alice, daughter of Thomas Brown of Kent; they had three daughters and a son, and she survived her husband.<br>
<br>Correspondence with Livingstone and Kirk, augmented over time by other missionaries, officials, and businessmen going to Africa, enabled Waller to command a continuing supply of African news, making him a key person for humanitarians and businessmen who were convinced of Britain's duty to end the slave trade and develop Africa's natural resources&#151;in the name of &#145;Christianity, commerce, and civilization&#146;. His position was recognized by his election in 1870 to the committee of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and in 1882 to the home committee of the UMCA.<br>
<br>When Livingstone's body and diaries were brought to England in 1874, Waller was asked to edit his <span class="italic">Last Journals</span>. He set out to ensure that Livingstone's name would continue as synonymous with the anti-slavery cause. He omitted all Livingstone's complaints about other travellers and his African attendants, depicting him as a gentle, saintly martyr. The death scene embodied this Livingstone legend. Livingstone's attendants Susi and Chuma had found him in death on his knees on his cot, his head on his pillow. Waller transmuted it into a powerful, moving image of the missionary doctor offering up a final prayer for the end to the &#145;great open sore&#146; of Africa.<br>
<br>Waller received letters with African news which he regularly sent on to the <span class="italic">Anti-Slavery Reporter</span> and, in over eighty letters to the editor, to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. His correspondents included Colonel George Gordon and Captain Frederick Lugard, men Waller hoped would become Livingstone's successors. Waller also consulted with the Scots sent to Nyasaland&#151;where he owned a large estate&#151;to create a Livingstone memorial mission, and kept in touch with Scottish businessmen attempting to extend legitimate trade in Africa. One, Sir William Mackinnon, eventually formed the Imperial British East Africa Company.<br>
<br>Convinced that British expansion would benefit Great Britain and Africa alike, Waller wrote for journals and published pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The Title-Deeds to Nyassa-Land</span> (1887), <span class="italic">Nyassaland: Great Britain's Case Against Portugal</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">Heligoland for Zanzibar, or, One Island Full of Free Men for Two Full of Slaves</span> (1893). In 1895 Waller retired from Twywell to Hampshire and died unexpectedly of pneumonia at Overcombe, Hill Brow, East Liss, on 22 February 1896; he was buried at Milland church, near Liphook, Hampshire, on 26 February.<br>
<br>Polemicist and advocate of British empire in Africa, Waller was a Conservative in politics and an evangelical in religion. He dedicated his life to opening up Africa to British influence. For him the British flag was the hope of Africa, and, indeed, it did bring an end to the slave trade, though the immediate benefits for Africans proved more illusory.<br>
