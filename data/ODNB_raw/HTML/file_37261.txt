<span class="headword">Carleton,  George</span>  (1529&#150;1590), <span class="occ">landowner and puritan</span>, was the second son of John Carleton of Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Joyce, daughter of John Welbeck of Oxenheath, Kent. His maternal grandmother was Margaret Culpepper, an aunt of Queen Katherine Howard. Carleton's father was receiver to the abbot of Westminster and later deputy receiver-general to the dean and chapter, a connection which secured his son a Westminster exhibition at Christ Church, Oxford, whence he passed to Gray's Inn in 1552. In 1557 Carleton served as a captain at St Quentin, and later in life he renewed his military career, in 1573, as treasurer to the Irish expedition of Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex. In 1559 Carleton married Audrey, daughter of Sir John Gainsford (<i>d</i>. 1540) of Crowhurst, Surrey, and his fifth wife, Audrey, daughter of Sir John Shaa, lord mayor of London. She was the widow successively of George Taylor of Longfield, Surrey, and of Sir George Harper of Sutton, Kent. She died early in 1560.<br>
<br>Carleton built up a sizeable estate in the eastern and midland counties, partly by inheritance and partly, in 1561, through the second of his three marriages. This was to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Walter Mohun of Overstone, Northamptonshire, and widow of Edward Cope of Hanwell, Oxfordshire. This marriage brought Carleton the manor of Overstone, where he mostly resided. He was a JP in Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, and the Isle of Ely, and he sat in four sessions of parliament: for Poole in 1571 and for Dorchester in 1572, 1576, and 1581, boroughs in which Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, had a commanding interest. Carleton employed his considerable legal and managerial powers in business partnerships, trusts, and other, sometimes disordered, financial affairs of various kinsmen and friends, and he was a persistent litigant. In the Lincolnshire fens he had public responsibilities as a commissioner for sewers, and private interests as an early &#145;adventurer&#146;; he was &#145;one of the very first that inned any marsh in Holland&#146;, and a pioneer of windmills and other &#145;engines&#146;, &#145;toys&#146;, and &#145;gewgaws&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>). He became superintendent of the Jesuits and other Catholic recusants imprisoned in Wisbech Castle.<br>
<br>Carleton's diverse interests were connected and charged with a kind of demonic energy by his ardent puritanism. In parliament most of his activity was directed towards a further reformation of the church along Presbyterian lines. He supported the successive initiatives of William Strickland, Paul Wentworth, and Wentworth's brother Peter, &#145;my beloved in the Lord&#146;, as well as the principles of parliamentary liberty for which these puritan members stood. Carleton believed that hardline protestants such as himself were the queen's only reliable subjects, her very &#145;bowels&#146;, and that these &#145;servants of God&#146; should be concentrated in the counties nearest London as a militia to protect the regime from Catholic subversion  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>). Alternatively, he argued, they should be encouraged to settle in Irish plantations, which in his thinking looked like blueprints for both Ulster and New England.<br>
<br>In the last year of his life Carleton's connections with the tightly knit puritan gentry of the midlands involved him in the puritan literary conspiracy of the Marprelate tracts. Also in 1589 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68274/', "Elizabeth Crane")</script>, daughter of Sir Robert Hussey of Linwood, Lincolnshire, and widow of Anthony Crane of St Martin-in-the-Fields. It was at her house at East Molesey, Surrey, that the first Marprelate tracts were printed, and she was to be heavily fined in the Star Chamber for her involvement. The Marprelate press then moved to Fawsley, the Northamptonshire seat of Sir Richard Knightley, an enthusiast not entirely <i>compos mentis</i>, whose affairs were in Carleton's hands. Several elusive references in the tracts themselves suggest that Carleton's involvement in this illicit venture may have been more than merely managerial. Carleton died early in January 1590, and was survived by his third wife.<br>
