<span class="headword">Ransom,  William Henry</span>  (1823&#150;1907), <span class="occ">physician and embryologist</span>, was born on 19 November 1823 at Cromer, Norfolk, the younger son of Henry Ransom (1793&#150;1832), a master mariner and shipowner, and his wife, Maria (<i>bap</i>. 1793, <i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of the Revd Richard Jones (1756?&#150;1814). Brought up in an evangelical atmosphere, Ransom was educated at a private school at Norwich and at sixteen was apprenticed for four years to a medical practitioner at King's Lynn. In 1843 he went to University College, London. Sitting the first part of his London University MB examination in anatomy and physiology, he competed with Thomas Henry Huxley (from Charing Cross Hospital) for an exhibition in 1845. Huxley, writing to Herbert Spencer in 1886, said, &#145;If Ransom had worked less hard I might have been first and he second, &hellip; in which case I should have obtained the Exhibition, should not have gone into the navy and should have forsaken science for practice&#146;  (Huxley, 142). After gaining his MB in 1847 Ransom held residential posts at University College Hospital. He then studied in Paris and Germany, and developed a continuing interest in continental medical and scientific literature. He graduated MD from the University of London in 1850.<br>
<br>Ransom settled in Nottingham at 26 Low Pavement, and, while waiting for patients to arrive, he undertook chemical and physiological studies in two rooms he had fitted out as laboratories. He was interested in the embryology of fish, and the development of galls and tumours in plants. On 14 August 1860 Ransom married Elizabeth Bramwell (<i>bap</i>. 1830, <i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of William Bramwell (1790?&#150;1854), surgeon, who was related to the distinguished Edinburgh physician Sir Byrom Bramwell, and his wife, Elizabeth Tate (1789&#150;1856); they had four sons and one daughter. Their eldest son, William Bramwell Ransom (1861&#150;1909), succeeded his father as physician at the Nottingham General Hospital.<br>
<br>W. H. Ransom was physician to the Nottingham General Hospital from 1854 to 1890, and later honorary consultant physician. He was a first-rate diagnostician and inspired confidence in his patients, although he could sometimes appear brusque. He emphasized hygienic principles when the Nottingham General Hospital was enlarged. The death of two of his children from scarlet fever directed his attention to infectious diseases, and in 1870 he devised a gas-heated, disinfecting stove for sterilizing infected clothing and bedding from fever patients. It was widely used until replaced by steam sterilization. Ransom became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1869 and also of the Medical and Chirurgical Society and of University College, London. He was elected FRS in 1870 for his studies on the fertilization of fish ova, with the support of famous names such as Thomas Huxley, Joseph Lister, and James Paget. Ransom was president of the section of medicine at the British Medical Association meeting in Nottingham in 1892, where his address dealt with aspects of plant pathology, and in particular gall formation, which he regarded as relevant to human pathology.<br>
<br>Ransom was active in the civic life of Nottingham. He was one of the first to join the Robin Hood 1st Notts rifle corps in 1857 and continued as a private for fifteen years. He was involved in the formation of the Nottingham Literary and Philosophic Society and Nottingham University College. He was on the governing board of the college and the high school, and campaigned for the Liberal Party during the 1860s. Ransom was also interested in geology and assisted in the exploration of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire caves. He read a paper at the first meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Nottingham in 1866: &#145;On the occurrence of <i>Felis lynx</i> as a British fossil&#146;. Ransom's only book, <span class="italic">The Inflammation Idea in General Pathology</span> (1905), was reviewed disparagingly in <span class="italic">Nature</span> and the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>.<br>
<br>After being ill for three years, Ransom died from heart failure at his home, 17 Park Valley, Nottingham, on 16 April 1907. He was commemorated by a marble medallion by F. W. Pomeroy in the entrance hall of the Nottingham General Hospital. The medallion was later removed to the Ransom Hospital, Mansfield. In 1923 the Ransom Memorial Committee gave several thousand pounds to establish a pathology laboratory in the Nottingham General Hospital in memory of the Ransoms, father and son.<br>
