</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pole,  Reginald</span>  (1500&#150;1558), <span class="occ">cardinal and archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was probably born at Stourton Castle, Staffordshire, in March 1500. He was the third son of Sir Richard Pole (1458/9&#150;1504), a client and relation of Henry VII and an important figure in north Wales, not least as chamberlain to Prince Arthur, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Margaret Pole (n&#233;e Plantagenet), countess of Salisbury (1473&#150;1541)")</script>, who was the daughter of George, duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>After being educated first either at Christ Church, Canterbury, or at the Charterhouse at Sheen, Pole went to Oxford, where he was a member of Magdalen College from about 1512 until about 1519. In 1512 Henry VIII paid him a pension of &pound;12 and repeated the gift in the following year. William Latimer was apparently his principal tutor and Thomas Linacre may also have taught him between 1518 and 1520. Pole was admitted BA on 27 June 1515. On 12 February 1518 the king granted him the deanery of Wimborne Minster, Dorset (he was deprived in June 1537), and on 19 March he was collated to the prebend of Ruscombe Southbury, Salisbury, only to exchange it on 10 April 1519 for Yetminster secunda (of which he was deprived before 13 July 1537).<br>
<br>Almost certainly in 1521 Pole went to Padua with a &pound;100 stipend from the king, having persuaded Thomas Wolsey to subvent his trip. The Venetian signory treated him as an important person and lodged him in the Palazzo Roccabonella. Pietro Bembo, doyen of Paduan humanists, introduced him to a wide circle of churchmen and writers, especially Gianmatteo Giberti, formerly Leo X's datary and chief minister, and Jacopo Sadoleto. Through Giberti, Pole met Gianpietro Carafa, the future Paul IV; relations with him remained important throughout Pole's career. Others he knew at Padua included several future cardinals and allies, among them Rodolfo Pio, Otto Truchsess, Stanislaus Hosius, Cristoforo Madruzzo, and Giovanni Morone, as well as Pier Paolo Vergerio the younger, Pietro Martire Vermigli (Peter Martyr), and Vettor Soranzo, the last three to be condemned as heretics. Christophe Longueil, Belgian cultivator of Cicero and polemicist against Luther, died in Pole's household and left Pole his library and some manuscript works. Pole's first published writing was Longueil's biography (1525).<br>
<br>Niccol&ograve; Leonico Tomeo tutored Pole, along with the shadowy Battista Leoni and Lazzaro Bonamico, whom Pole would unsuccessfully try to convert from grammarian into philosopher or theologian. Leonico dedicated his <span class="italic">Dialogi</span> (1524) to Pole, who also became known to Erasmus through Thomas Lupset. More important to Pole were Marcantonio Flaminio and Pole's lifelong companion, Alvise Priuli. Priuli, a member of a Venetian banking family whose brother would become doge, shared (when he did not initiate) Pole's most central religious and personal experiences. Pole was away from Padua for much of the first eight months of 1524 and again in 1525, when he made a brief visit to Rome for the jubilee. His studies were partly financed by his election as a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 14 February 1523, which allowed him to study abroad for three years.<h2>
<a name="Thedivorce"></a>The divorce</h2>Pole returned home about the end of that period, having remained in Padua until July 1526, when he went to France, escorted by Lupset. He probably arrived in England in 1527, though his presence there is not recorded before November 1528. Shortly before Pole left Padua, on 10 April 1526, his brother Henry, Lord Montagu, presented him to the living of South Harting, Sussex. On 22 April 1527 he was admitted to the prebend of Knaresborough in York Minster, and on 25 July he was presented to a canonry in Exeter Cathedral; four days later he was elected dean (confirmed on 12 August; deprived June 1537). In October 1529 Pole was sent to Paris in order to help secure a favourable opinion from the university doctors on Henry's divorce. Pole would later make it appear that he had tried to avoid the assignment, but the evidence does not support his version. This was to be only the first of many such reworkings of his life's story.<br>
<br>In fact Pole succeeded completely in his errand and returned home in the summer of 1530 to great expectations. For at least some of the time which he spent in England he lived in John Colet's former house at Sheen. It may be that Pole began to learn Hebrew from Robert Wakefield; if so, this might mean that Henry intended to make further use of Pole in the divorce project. Yet probably in May or June 1531 Pole gave Henry an analysis of the political difficulties in the way of a divorce, particularly the dangers to the succession and from foreign princes. Pole told various stories, and his biographers added their versions, of what he did before offering that opinion, but none can be corroborated; it is clear only that Pole left England again in January or February 1532 without the promotion, perhaps even the archbishopric of York, that had seemed certain. Pole was soon claiming to have given the king his negative opinion about the divorce, but this seems unlikely, above all since he almost certainly at least tacitly acquiesced in convocation's acceptance of Henry VIII's supreme headship in February 1531. Had he opposed the king's wishes it is difficult to see how he could have avoided an indictment for <i>praemunire</i>, like that which fell on fifteen others, or the loss of his benefices.<br>
<br>Pole's story of an interview with Thomas Cromwell that allegedly caused him to flee England is almost certainly an invention. If it occurred, the encounter must have fallen between Pole's return from Italy (as he stated) and departure for Paris, that is, before October 1529. Had Pole already been as fearful of the consequences of Cromwell's policy as he later maintained, he would have behaved strangely not only in helping enthusiastically in Paris, but also in returning to England for another year and a half. In the story which Pole later told Charles V, Cromwell recommended Machiavelli's <span class="italic">Prince</span> as the ideal statesman's manual, and brushed aside Pole's attempts to defend a more traditional political morality as being mere school exercises.<h2>
<a name="Deunitate"></a>De unitate</h2>After he left England in early 1532 Pole made a six-month stop in Avignon and then Carpentras with Sadoleto before heading via Verona for Padua where he arrived before the end of October. On the way he read Sadoleto's <span class="italic">De liberis recte instituendis</span> (&#145;On the proper education of boys&#146;), which helped to trigger profound reflections about the limits of human reason and the superiority to philosophy of theology, which Pole claimed had been his sole study for the last four years. That would date to Wakefield's tutoring in Hebrew and produce the great irony that it was Henry who made Pole a theologian. Others quickly saw his potential, especially the imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys, who tried as early as 1533 to persuade the emperor of Pole's usefulness against Henry. Chapuys suggested that Pole marry Princess Mary and draw on his family's base of support in Wales. It was probably this dynastic threat which gave most concern to Henry. Pole's client Thomas Starkey also foresaw great things for his patron, casting him as an expert on the commonwealth in his &#145;Dialogue between Pole and Lupset&#146; written between 1529 and 1532. On 20 December 1532 Pole received his last English benefice, the rectory of Piddletown, Dorset (vacated January 1536).<br>
<br>During his second visit to Italy, Pole was especially close to Cosmo Gheri, the young bishop of Fano, but more importantly he became a client of Gasparo Contarini, soon to be a cardinal and leader of the reform wing in Rome, and developed deep ties to several Cassinese Benedictines, especially Gregorio Cortese and Marco the monk. Cassinese spirituality was central to Pole's experience and he would later be protector of the order.<br>
<br>Pole kept mainly to Padua and its vicinity until his call to Rome in July 1536. In the interval he underwent a religious conversion and wrote his most famous book, <span class="italic">Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione</span> (&#145;Defence of the unity of the church&#146;), known as <span class="italic">De unitate</span> (first published at Rome in 1539). Pole's conversion gave him a scriptural religion especially drawn from Paul, rooted in justification by faith. <span class="italic">De unitate</span> was begun in response to Henry's demands for Pole's opinion on two points: the legitimacy of marriage to a dead brother's wife; and the divine establishment of the papacy. Pole did not begin to write seriously until late summer, having on 17 June sent Edmund Harvel to the emperor with plans for dealing with Henry, while Contarini had virtually asked imperial protection for Pole. The emperor replied quickly if noncommittally. Henry urged Pole on by sending copies of books by Richard Sampson and Stephen Gardiner. Pole contemptuously dismissed Gardiner but directed much of <span class="italic">De unitate</span> against Sampson's argument for the royal supremacy, the blame for which he now laid squarely on Henry and on Anne Boleyn. None the less Pole also regularly argued after <span class="italic">De unitate</span> that bishops like Sampson had betrayed their flocks' trust by failing to resist the king.<br>
<br>Pole justified <span class="italic">De unitate's</span> violent language with the claim that Henry VIII's desperate situation demanded strong remedies. One of these was a joint appeal to the nobility of England and to Charles to take action. The first succeeded only in making the emperor deeply suspicious. Pole correctly claimed that he wrote in defence of ecclesiastical unity, but he did not put forward the strongly papalist views that have often been ascribed to him. Just as important, the work reflected Pole's nascent stress on faith and experience as the basis of his religion (Pole glossed the book as being about how heresy arose from &#145;confidence in human reason&#146;  (MS Vat. lat. 5967, fols. 504ff.)) and deep trust in prophetic solutions. <span class="italic">De unitate</span> is also important for its contribution to the hagiography of John Fisher and Thomas More, in which Pole would further interest himself thereafter. It concluded with an extended call to Henry to repent.<br>
<br>Although Pole insisted that he intended his writing for Henry alone, many others had been involved in its composition, especially Contarini and Priuli. While he was writing <span class="italic">De unitate</span> Pole was also instructing Contarini in how to deal with Charles V, then in Rome, as well as planning his own mission to the emperor. He also began spreading defamatory rumours about Henry, not for the last time, being largely responsible for the tale that Henry had Thomas Becket's bones burnt, a probably mythical action that finally triggered publication of the king's excommunication on 17 December 1538. On 27 May 1536 Pole dispatched <span class="italic">De unitate</span>. He suggested that Henry appoint a committee to read the book, and the king agreed, among those nominated being Pole's former clients Starkey and Richard Morison. Cromwell increasingly stridently demanded that Pole come home, and Pole reacted by making Cromwell, along with Henry, the villain in the destruction of the English church. He had already opened negotiations via Contarini about a summons for himself to Rome. It came on 19 July 1536. Pole had not given up on England and corresponded with Cuthbert Tunstall throughout the summer. Starkey and Morison also tried to persuade Pole to embrace the marriage and the new English ecclesiastical order, and he admitted that he could see nothing wrong with the ten articles, except for the supreme headship. Even before Pole reached Rome, moreover, Contarini had consulted him on the germ of what became the important (if never executed) reform document, the <span class="italic">Consilium de emendanda ecclesia</span> (1538), written by a commission on which Pole served immediately after his arrival in Rome. It blamed excessive papal power for the church's woes.<h2>
<a name="Cardinalateandfirstlegation"></a>Cardinalate and first legation</h2>On 22 December 1536 Pole was made a cardinal and shortly thereafter, on 7 February 1537, appointed legate with instructions dated 14 February covering peace, the Turks, and the general council. His real assignment was to assist the Pilgrimage of Grace. Since Pole had hoped for such a mission earlier in 1536 and shortly after his promotion spelled out for Paul III exactly what it should do, it seems unlikely, as his biographers claimed, that Pole resisted becoming a cardinal in any more than nominal fashion. The legation had to supply funds to the rebels and Paul III agreed, giving Pole a letter of full papal credit in order to raise money in Flanders. Pole's mission posed three other threats to Henry VIII. He might publish <span class="italic">De unitate</span>; he might release Henry's excommunication; but perhaps most dangerously, he had in his company the young earl of Kildare, heir to one of the most powerful Anglo-Irish families, whose father Henry had recently had executed, and was paying particular attention to Ireland. Giberti, sent because of his high diplomatic standing, directed Pole's operations. Two days after his appointment Pole wrote to both Cromwell and the council saying there was no point in further correspondence but expressing his eagerness to talk face to face. The English held out the prospect of a conference in Flanders. The degree of uncertainty Pole's actions aroused in England is well indicated by a report that he might, but also might not, lose his benefices. He travelled slowly, constantly worried about money, leaving Rome on 18 February and reaching Lyons only on 24 March. The encouragement of a bull of 31 March 1537, granting a crusading indulgence to anyone who undertook to overthrow Henry by force, did not make him move much faster. When Pole finally reached Paris on 10 April, Fran&ccedil;ois I expelled him because of treaty obligations to Henry. Pole then headed for Cambrai, where he spent at least a month and had to dodge several assassination attempts mounted by John Hutton, the English ambassador to Mary of Hungary, as well as avoid marauding soldiers. Pole had to ask several times for permission to enter imperial territory, but was finally licensed to go to Li&egrave;ge. On 2 May, however, he was still at Cambrai, from where he wrote to Cromwell remonstrating about the attacks on him and again protesting that he was only trying to help. Shortly afterwards Pole was recalled but pressed on to Li&egrave;ge anyway, repeatedly asking the pope to let him stay in order to encourage the English rebels should they rise again. After he had reached the Cistercian abbey of Aulne, Hugh Holland came from England to warn Pole of the plots against him. Pole made his formal entry to Li&egrave;ge at the end of May or beginning of June, but this affair&#151;like his whole stay&#151;was low-key. He enjoyed the hospitality of Cardinal Erard de la Marck, though he could not stay in de la Marck's palace because it was under repair. On 7 June serious retaliation began in England with the grant of Wimborne Minster to Nicholas Wilson. On 30 June the pope once more demanded that Pole return and this time he agreed, though he did not leave until 22 August, and on the day before his departure fired off one last salvo to Contarini, calling the rulers of England enemies of &#145;the whole human race&#146;  (Mayer, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, no. 203). A week or more after Pole left, William Peto, acting on a plan apparently communicated by Michael Throckmorton, helped to cover the cardinal's tracks by suggesting to Hutton that Wilson be sent to confer with Pole. Cromwell drafted instructions for Wilson and Nicholas Heath, but apparently learned of Pole's departure before dispatching the pair. Cromwell's greatest concern was <span class="italic">De unitate</span>, the minute of which Pole was to be asked to surrender &#145;at once&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 620). When Pole returned to Rome he apparently took with him the Flemish painter Lambert Lombard, who subsequently returned home to found one of the most important ateliers of the century in the Low Countries. Pole was received in consistory on 18 October.<h2>
<a name="Secondlegation"></a>Second legation</h2>On 7 January 1538 Pole was appointed to the commission of cardinals preparing a general council. Paul III confirmed Pole as head of the English hospice in Rome on 8 March, when nearly all its inmates were Pole's dependants. Pole accompanied the pope to the peace conference at Nice in April&#150;June 1538. He had no impact on the discussions, but Ludovico Beccadelli, his first biographer, who claimed to have been present, alleged that Charles V enquired about Pole when being received by the College of Cardinals. Beccadelli also reported as eyewitness another meeting between the cardinal and the emperor at Villefranche-sur-Mer in which Charles treated Pole like a brother. The English ambassador, Sir Thomas Wyatt, and his agents tried to get close to Pole but failed. After a few months at Priuli's house in Treville, Pole returned to Rome in October. During his stay in the Veneto, Harry Phillips appeared, perhaps intending to assassinate him. Robert Brancetor also approached Pole for the first time; he would later be one of his messengers to Protector Somerset. Pole had not forgotten Henry VIII, and shortly after Nice asked for another legation. But before Paul could grant it Henry struck first by attacking the so-called Exeter conspiracy in which Pole's brothers Henry, Lord Montagu, and Sir Geoffrey were implicated, and his mother was also arrested; Montagu was executed on 2 December. Pole received his new legation shortly thereafter, perhaps on Christmas day, with instructions to induce the emperor to help depose Henry by cutting off trade, a possible consequence of the divorce Pole had suggested in 1531.<br>
<br>Travelling a little faster this time than in 1537, and with Beccadelli in company, Pole reached the imperial court at Toledo on 11 February. But Charles and Pole had almost nothing to say to one another, although Pole could not miss the emperor's refusal to help without French co-operation. Warned by an imperial courtier that Charles disliked Pole's appeal to the nobility against Henry, Pole in disappointment tried to explain himself in a long letter, intended for a preface to <span class="italic">De unitate</span>. Although not published until the eighteenth century its impact on later historiography has made it one of Pole's most important works. It probably also had more contemporary resonance than has been thought, especially through its sustained attack on Machiavelli. Pole almost certainly had a hand in the latter's condemnation as anti-Christian by writers like Jeronimo Os&oacute;rio. Perhaps Pole's most important argument to Charles was religious, that Henry posed the worst threat to the faith, &#145;the foundation of the church&#146;. The constituents of that faith included belief in martyrs like Becket whose ignominious end, his bones burnt and their ashes scattered to the wind, Pole cast in the form in which it passed into history first through the bull excommunicating Henry and then through the writings of Pole's clients. On 11 April 1539, writing from Carpentras, Pole sent one more appeal to Charles's chief minister, emphasizing how much his opposition to Henry had cost him and pleading with the emperor for vengeance. He asked the pope to inform the emperor of the French king's attitude (Fran&ccedil;ois claimed he was ready to act whenever Charles was), and Paul did so on 16 April. By mid-May, however, Pole knew that Charles had rejected the pope's appeal.<br>
<br>On 19 May 1539 Pole was attainted in a monster bill nominally aimed at the Exeter conspirators but really directed against Pole and his family, including his aged mother. Outlawed in England and frustrated in his legation, he was reduced to quiet study in the Observant Franciscan house of Montili at Carpentras. On 17 July he reported encouraging news from Ireland about war plans, but without providing any clear particulars. In late summer Paul proposed to make him bishop of Salisbury, but Pole refused lest he become an object of ridicule, since he could neither occupy the see nor use it for action against Henry. Instead he begged to be allowed to winter at Carpentras or Verona. In late September he headed for Italy.<h2>
<a name="LegateofViterbo"></a>Legate of Viterbo</h2>When Contarini attended the diet of Regensburg as papal legate in the first half of 1541 he depended on Pole for support in the curia. The conference, part of Charles's efforts to secure religious peace in his realms, marked the last realistic chance for rapprochement between Catholics and protestants. For some reason Pole failed his patron and Rome rejected the compromise on the central issue of justification that Contarini had developed. The matter is the more mysterious in that Pole claimed to approve the compromise, wishing only that Contarini would have a chance to give it a grounding in scripture.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1541 Pole's relations with Vittoria Colonna, established several years before, deepened for both religious and personal reasons as he took her as a replacement mother after the countess of Salisbury's execution on 27 May. Pole's relation to his mother is difficult to grasp. At the time of <span class="italic">De unitate</span> he tried at first to brush her aside in a manner that was well-nigh callous, before admitting that her letter asking him to come home was &#145;so miserably written&#146;  (Mayer, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, no. 122) that his resolve had almost failed. His reaction to her death astonished Beccadelli, although this may be an apocryphal story. Calling her a martyr, Pole offered the stricken Beccadelli the consolation of having &#145;one more advocate in paradise&#146;  (Beccadelli, 329). He then withdrew into his oratory and came out an hour later in his usual good humour. He wrote in very similar terms to several correspondents who had offered condolences, emphasizing how quickly he had recovered from her execution, and converting it from a private loss to a public gain for the church. There can be no doubt that he shared an intense religious and personal relationship with Colonna, one of the more important instances of Pole's success as spiritual counsellor, especially to highly placed women. For her part Colonna claimed that Pole had rescued her from killing herself through her penitential practices.<br>
<br>On 12&#150;13 August 1541 Pole became legate of the patrimony of Peter, the portion of the Papal States centred upon Viterbo. Although he regularly involved himself in the legation's business he had considerable leisure, and there gathered around him one of the most important groups in the history of the Italian Reformation, notable among them Flaminio and Pietro Carnesecchi. Their most significant product was the <span class="italic">Beneficio di Cristo</span> (&#145;The Benefit of Christ's Death&#146;, 1543), which became so popular that 40,000 copies were supposedly sold in Venice alone. It conceived of the church as a small group of the elect, justified through salvation by faith alone. Despite this &eacute;litist view, Pole and Contarini also engaged in an extensive dialogue about the proper manner of preaching, and both probably accepted that ordinary Christians had to be introduced gradually to true belief. Pole's treatise on preaching, written in 1541 and probably often revised thereafter, has however been lost, the only one of his works to leave no trace. Almost immediately after the refoundation of the Roman Inquisition on 21 July 1541 his circle came under suspicion. The flight of Bernardino Ochino and Vermigli in August heightened the tension, but it would be some years before the Inquisition's interest caused difficulties for Pole. His standing with Paul III and with his successor, Julius III, protected him from the worst that the inquisitors, chief among them Carafa, could do.<h2>
<a name="Trent"></a>Trent</h2>In October 1542 Pope Paul chose Pole as one of three legates to the Council of Trent. Although the first session came to nothing, during it Pole renewed his acquaintance with Giovanni Morone, later Paul IV's most famous victim. The two became close friends and stout allies. Pole was back in Rome by September 1543, where he served as one of the pope's principal advisers about the suspended council. In that capacity he had a hand in the flat rejection of a national council in Germany and in the drafting of <span class="italic">Laetare Hierusalem</span>, 19 November 1544, the bull resummoning the council that reconvened on 13 December 1545. Pole was again made legate on 22 February, and shortly after Easter (5 April) he left for Trent. Part of the delay was due to fears of an assassination attempt organized by Henry's agent Ludovico dalle Armi, a leading mercenary captain, and part to Pole's writing a small book on the council. Although <span class="italic">De concilio</span> is known only in later texts, including a posthumous printing, it agrees sufficiently with Pole's opening sermon to the council to enable it to be said that he thought the council's primary purpose was the determination of the faith that held the church together, an argument grounded almost exclusively in scripture. Pole's own religion depended heavily on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, especially the prophets and the Pauline epistles, although he was unable to carry the proposal that the council re-examine the scriptural canon book by book. He did not play a leading role in the council, and left it on 28 June before the inflammatory debate on justification had proceeded very far. He withdrew for reasons of health to Treville, but could not avoid being forced to give his opinion on the draft decree. However reluctantly, he explicitly rejected its emphasis on works at the expense of faith. He then relinquished his legateship and returned to Rome on 17 November 1546.<br>
<br>Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547, and it was thought at that time that Pole would be sent as legate to Germany in the hope of persuading the emperor to take action against England, but the appointment did not come through. Instead, he became perpetual governor of Bagnoregio, not far from Viterbo. His opposition could not prevent the translation of the general council to Bologna in 1548 and he was made responsible for the pope's reply to the resulting imperial protest. Late in 1548 Pole saw an opportunity to approach Protector Somerset. The English responded favourably and in April 1549 Pole dispatched Richard Hilliard and Brancetor to England. Hilliard was to stress the dangers facing England, foremost among them a boy king, and propose a conference in Flanders. The English government's reply of 6 June 1549 was not encouraging and before Pole answered it the western rebellion and the beginning of the protector's difficulties had altered the terms of discussion. The rebels called for Pole's restoration and his addition to the royal council, and there was a moment when it looked as if Pole would go to England. Instead, he wrote Somerset an enormous letter, begun before the rebellion and finished on 12 October 1549, in which he repeatedly accused the protector of discourtesy, making his case through autobiographical examples, including a detailed treatment of his own family's misfortunes. There the matter ended.<h2>
<a name="TheconclaveofJuliusIII"></a>The conclave of Julius III</h2>Less than a month later, on 10 October 1549, Paul III died, just after conferring on Pole <i>in commendam</i> the rich abbey of Canalnuovo or Gavello in the Polesine. After much manoeuvring there emerged a party favouring Pole's candidacy for the papacy, composed of the imperial cardinals and Cardinal Farnese's group. The conclave opened on 29 November and on the first ballot of 3 December, Pole led the field. The following day he had twenty-four of the twenty-eight votes necessary, and Farnese proposed to &#145;adore&#146; him, or elect him by acclamation. Pole initially agreed before rejecting Farnese's scheme. Nevertheless, Pole's election was considered so certain that the bankers rated him as 95 per cent certain of success; pontifical vestments were made, and his cell was looted as the palace (had he had one) of a successful candidate regularly was. Pole may even have written an acceptance speech. The following day he garnered twenty-six votes, but the remaining two could not be found. Although it is usually claimed that Carafa's attack on Pole as a heretic was responsible, the latter's own steadfast refusal to do anything to forward his candidacy did most to undermine him. Carafa also charged Pole with being a poor governor and having an illegitimate daughter, and many cardinals objected to him as a foreigner. The heart of the opposition to Pole lay in the French camp, and the balance between that and the imperial / Farnese alignment deadlocked the conclave. Pole spent the time writing <span class="italic">De summo pontifice</span> in which he further developed his martyrological view of the papacy and argued that the only acceptable candidate would be one who did not want the office. He also offered a radical reinterpretation of the pope's duties towards the church as essentially those owed by the supreme pastor to his flock. In the end Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte was elected as Julius III.<br>
<br>Almost as soon as the conclave ended Pole drew a portrait of his constancy throughout the proceedings that provided the basis for his earliest biographies by Beccadelli and Andras Dudic. The new pope treated Pole as one of the principal cardinals, assigning him to the congregation of the Inquisition (although Pole failed to serve for long, apparently because he objected to its methods) and also protecting him from investigation. He further appointed Pole to commissions for the reform of the datary and for the council, and greatly increased his papal pension. But perhaps the pope's biggest favour to Pole was the reconciliation he forced on Carafa in March or April 1553 at San Paolo fuori le Mura, Rome, following several new signs of interest in Pole's orthodoxy on the part of the Inquisition. Meanwhile Pole began work on a new edition of <span class="italic">De unitate</span>, under pressure from a number of cardinals and the chief papal theologian. It was to have a long preface to Edward VI that would explain how the book came to be written and induce the king to reverse Pole's attainder, but neither the new edition nor its preface was published.<h2>
<a name="LegatetoEnglandagain"></a>Legate to England again</h2>Almost immediately after the confrontation with Carafa, Pole left Rome for the Cassinese Benedictine house of Maguzzano on Lake Garda, where he intended to spend the summer. A withdrawal to such a distance suggests that Pole had earlier told the truth when he said he intended never to return to Rome. In fact he would not, for with the death of Edward VI and the victory of Mary Tudor over Lady Jane Grey the prospect opened of a return to England as legate for its reconciliation. Excitement ran high in both Rome and Maguzzano, and frequent letters and messengers crossed paths both before and after Pole's appointment on 5&#150;6 August. Julius gave him exceptionally wide powers making him virtually equivalent to the pope. Pole was eager to start at once, but his inflexible attitude on two points promised trouble. The restoration of obedience had to come first, as he wrote to the queen on 13 August and even more bluntly to Stephen Gardiner on 28 August; and the former monastic property must be restored. Moreover the imperial ambassador in Venice objected to Pole's mission within five days of his appointment. Thus between the cardinal's attitude and diplomatic considerations his mission soon came to a standstill. Pole willingly acquiesced in efforts to get more information from England, but this did not change his opinion that Mary's first parliament had to settle the two urgent points. A messenger brought back the story of the duke of Northumberland's apostasy, and Pole helped to turn it into a continental propaganda coup.<br>
<br>On 21&#150;2 August Pole sent to Charles V, spelling out the dangers in delaying obedience. But even before the messenger reached Brussels orders came from the emperor that Pole could go no further than Trent. It may be that Charles was already thinking of a marriage between his son Philip and Mary, and when Pole's opposition to it became known it reinforced Charles's determination to stop the cardinal's return. Pole never clearly spelt out his objections to the match, but probably fear of Spanish domination of England was high on the list. Imperial control of communications with England made it impossible for Mary to act directly on his advice even had she wished to do so. Julius secretly gave Pole a free hand to deal with England and on 20 September recalled his peace legates, replacing them with the cardinal, in part as a cover for his real assignment. Pole reached Trent on 30 September and left again almost immediately. After a brief stay in Dillingen on the upper Danube, he moved on, only to encounter an imperial messenger at Heidenheim who ordered him to return to Dillingen, which was also now the pope's and Mary's wish. Pole did so with an ill grace, remaining there until the end of the year. Meanwhile peace negotiations began in France, and in November 1553 Mary slipped Pole a letter saying she hoped that he could soon come to Brussels under the cover of his peace legation. In December the cardinal both wrote to Mary and also sent several messengers to tell her that grounding her title on parliament's authority was a serious mistake.<br>
<br>Pedro de Soto's mission to the imperial court at the same time produced permission for Pole to go to Brussels, which he reached on 25 January 1554. The pope then ordered him to turn to peacemaking, and Pole suggested a Habsburg&#150;Valois conference at a neutral site. After many discussions with imperial officials Pole left for France on 26 February. On the road he sent another messenger to Mary, congratulating her on the defeat of Wyatt's rebellion, while also using the occasion to remind the queen of Belshazzar's fate as a profaner of holy vessels, a reference to church property, and an object lesson in the consequences of delaying obedience. On 3 March, Julius sent Pole another breve of faculties, emphasizing that he could do nearly everything the pope could, including temporarily confirming Mary's episcopal appointments. When Pole reached France Henri II refused to see him until after Easter, and the cardinal used the time to compose his &#145;Oratio di pace&#146;, which he dispatched to Henri and Charles. Declaring that peace must be rooted in love between the two monarchs, it proved popular in print both in the original Italian and in Latin translation.<br>
<br>On 17&#150;18 March 1554 Pole issued his first important documents as legate, absolving seven English bishops of schism and reappointing them to their sees. But when he returned to Brussels without any concrete proposals for peace he was in such disgrace that he may have requested recall, although Charles did not demand it. Rome was not much happier with him, especially because of his attitude to the Spanish match and to the machinations against Mary of his nephew Thomas Stafford. Pole insisted that he approved the English queen's marriage and had rebuffed Stafford to indicate this. Julius kept Pole in place and resolved, or so he thought, the property issue by ordering Pole to allow Mary to deal with it. While continuing to work for peace in the summer Pole encountered criticism from another quarter. Vergerio launched an attack on him as a Nicodemite, one who knowing the truth yet concealed it, and to add force to the blow prepared a new edition of <span class="italic">De unitate</span> with a number of anti-papal tracts appended. It appeared in 1555 (or perhaps late 1554). In his defence Pole admitted that he had once believed in justification by faith but after reading the apostle James claimed to have seen the need for works.<h2>
<a name="Thereconciliation"></a>The reconciliation</h2>By late summer 1554 prospects for Pole's return to England were brightening, in part because he expressed public approval of Mary's Spanish marriage. Even so, in September Pole wrote Philip a strongly worded letter demanding admission. The stumbling block was still the property, and the &#145;final&#146; deal struck in October, before Pole received permission to go home, still had to be rehearsed again directly with Philip shortly after the cardinal reached London. The king agreed that the crown would not keep any property it could not hold with a good conscience, and in 1555 Mary renounced first fruits and tenths, under heavy pressure from Pole. Without waiting for an escort from England, and in a great hurry in order to make the shortly to assemble parliament, the cardinal left Brussels on 11 November, meeting Paget and Sir Edward Hastings at Ghent on the 16th. He was both hopeful and fearful, as he wrote to Morone: hopeful that the reconciliation was finally about to happen, and still fearful about church property. On the 19th his party entered Calais, where the marshall and two hundred horse met it, and crossed on the 20th to Dover, where Pole was received by Sir Anthony Browne and Bishop Thirlby, as well as by his nephew Henry Hastings, who had married his brother Henry's daughter Katherine. Pole's return to England allowed him to renew ties to his family, especially to Katherine and another niece, Winifred Hastings.<br>
<br>Although the patent for the exercise of Pole's legatine jurisdiction had been issued on 10 November, it was still not thought politic for him to use the insignia of his legation lest he appear to infringe the authority of parliament, under which the current ecclesiastical regime had been put in place, but he did not stand on his dignity. The steadily swelling procession reached Canterbury in the middle of the night. Archdeacon Harpsfield offered a long welcoming oration, which Pole interrupted when it turned to personal praise of the legate. On the 22nd Pole's attainder was reversed, their majesties attending parliament to give assent, and at his next stop at Cobham, where he was met by a crowd of eight hundred (fully 1000 at Gravesend), he received the news from the earl of Shrewsbury and Bishop John White. Now finally with his cross in the prow of the royal barge, Pole arrived by water at Whitehall where he met the king and queen. His ascetic looks impressed at least one observer, and he may have greeted Mary with the blessing her namesake received while pregnant with Jesus, &#145;blessed is the fruit of your womb&#146;  (<span class="roman">Luke</span>, 1:42). On 28 November, Pole addressed parliament in English, thanking it for restoring him and urging it to do the same for God. As they had returned him to &#145;his country and the earthly nobility&#146; so he would them to their &#145;true country and true celestial nobility&#146;  (Querini, 5.312). Since Pole had spoken too quietly his former adversary Gardiner amplified his remarks, and took the occasion to call him a prophet.<br>
<br>Two days later, on St Andrew's day (30 November), Pole formally reconciled the realm to the papacy. The event was carefully stage managed, beginning with the six Garter knights who conducted Pole in full pontificals from Lambeth to Westminster Palace. The cardinal read out a brief formula beginning<blockquote>Our Lord Jesus Christ, which with his precious blood has redeemed us, and purified us of all our sins and pollutions, in order to make himself a glorious bride without stains and without wrinkle, whom the Father made chief over the church, he through his mercy absolves you (Querini, 5.317)</blockquote>and then confirmed the reconciliation in a formal document. The following Sunday, Pole went to St Paul's where Gardiner preached on the pericope for that day, &#145;Now it is high time to awake out of sleep&#146;.<br>
<br>On 24 December, having made one more rearguard attempt to preserve the church's property, Pole dispensed lay holders to keep it (taken into 1 &amp; 2 Philip and Mary, c. 8). This should have ended the matter, but Pole later claimed that one of the reasons he stayed at court after becoming archbishop of Canterbury was in order to continue efforts to get the property back. Despite this reverse he began at once to consult the bishops in convocation about the needs of their dioceses. In early March 1555, after parliament rose and at approximately the same time as he distributed instructions about how to implement the reconciliation, he secured the sending of a mission to Rome. It finally rendered obedience not to Julius III but to his successor but one, Paul IV, the former Carafa. Although a leading imperialist candidate in both the conclaves following Julius's death in 1555, Pole had refused to stand. In the meantime he had convened the long-awaited peace conference at Marcq near Calais. He offered the usual exhortations, but the conference, staged at great cost to Mary, broke up on 9 June without accomplishing anything. Instead the strongly anti-Spanish Carafa was about to sign the treaty of Vaucelles with France which, by preparing the way for war against the empire, would haunt the rest of Pole's life. Nevertheless, on 10 June, in Paul's first consistory, the new pope confirmed Pole's actions and praised him extravagantly, and despite annoyingly minute attention in Rome to the state of the English church, cordial relations obtained between pope and legate until the end of the year. Then Paul explicitly exempted Pole from the recall of legates in Philip's territory as relations between king and pope worsened. When the mission to renew obedience to Rome returned to England in August it brought a number of bulls, including one, <span class="italic">Praeclara</span>, which rectified the consequences for the property settlement stemming from the pope's sweeping condemnation on 14 July of alienations of ecclesiastical property.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>In 1554 and 1555 Pole was involved in the trial and condemnation of Archbishop Cranmer, although he did not play the leading part assigned him by protestant propagandists. His official involvement was limited to certifying the notaries at Cranmer's trial, which was conducted by authority of the chief inquisitor in Rome, although those of Latimer and Ridley may have depended on the legate. Pole may have been partly responsible for Henry Cole's involvement in Cranmer's case, as he almost certainly was for that of his own clients de Soto and Juan de Villagarcia; however, it was Mary and not Pole who insisted on Cranmer's death. Otherwise, he wrote Cranmer two fairly standard polemical letters, one of which was later published as <span class="italic">De sacramento</span> (Cremona, 1584). In addition to arguing for the real presence and papal supremacy, the piece is distinguished by Pole's insistence on the necessity of childlike faith.<br>
<br>On 2 December, Pole opened a legatine synod in London. This was his most important action as legate, on both the domestic and European stage. Although it was originally summoned to deal with church property, and assembled in the context of the Dudley conspiracy and an unsettled international atmosphere, the synod accomplished a good deal more than has usually been recognized. Something of Pole's hopes for it may be deduced from his sprawling dialogue &#145;De reformatione ecclesiae&#146; (left unpublished), especially in its emphasis on the responsibilities of bishops and on education, although he later seems to have changed his mind on both issues, coming to stress the importance of episcopal residence to the extent of giving the impression that he did not care whether bishops had any more education than they could get from the Holy Spirit. Pole laid much of the blame for the failings of the English church on its clergy, and most of the synod's decrees concerned their reform, covering the sacraments, clerical residence, preaching (the bishops' principal duty), and church property, mandating a survey of its current state that would continue to the end of the Marian regime. Perhaps the most important canon established diocesan seminaries for the education of boys intended for the clergy, a precedent later adopted by Tridentine legislation. The synod also ordered visitations of all dioceses as well as of both universities (it has been claimed that these provided the model for their Elizabethan successors), and sketched out standards of lay discipline.<br>
<br>One of the synod's most important calls, for the preparation of sermons that less educated priests could read, was met after some delay. Sermons fared better than the catechism: Pole asked Bartolom&eacute; Carranza to write one, but it did not appear until 1558 and then only in Latin. Similarly, the synod's discussion of scripture, including the need for a new translation, was not incorporated into the canons. Pole played his characteristic role of exhortation, and also tried to further his educational goals by commissioning a treatise from the noted Roman Aristotelian and physician Girolamo da Ponte, sometime Pole's client, on the education of youth. But apart from this very short work Pole never provided much guidance about curriculum, either in the seminaries or in the universities. Towards the end of the synod Pole preached a sermon in which he excoriated clerical covetousness as encouraging heretics and charged the clergy to improve the level of both their own and their flocks' education. The synod was prorogued, probably on 10 February 1556, and never met again. Its canons proved difficult to draw up and were never officially promulgated. In any case, the clergy (including the bishops who now had to take preaching seriously) were said to be greatly offended by the new regulations.<br>
<br>Pole's legatine and archiepiscopal registers contain plentiful evidence for his efforts to improve the quality of the clergy, but the numbers on whom he had a direct impact remained small. Nevertheless, many of those to whom he related became leading recusants, among them Nicholas Morton, John Ramridge, and Henry Joliffe, as did several of the men who formed his impressive staff, among them David Pole, Henry Cole, and Nicholas Harpsfield. That Pole's legation failed to have much more general impact was largely due to lack of time (he was legate in England for little more than two years) and to the scale of the problems left by twenty years of schism, above all the decay of discipline and the marked shortage of clergy and administrators. If Pole erred in his response to these difficulties by trying to extend the model of a small Christian community, his quasi-monastic household, to the whole of England, he was making a mistake committed by many other reformers.<br>
<br>Pole obtained virtually complete control of the English church when in the midst of the synod, on 11 December 1555, he became Cranmer's successor, the pope again lavishly praising him. His patent of possession is dated 17 March 1556, and the see's temporalities were restored on the day Cranmer was burnt, 21 March. The Dudley conspiracy prevented Pole's going to Canterbury for his consecration. Instead, he was ordained priest on 20 March, consecrated in the Observant Franciscan house at Greenwich two days later, and on the 25th received the pallium in St Mary Arches, a Canterbury peculiar in London. There he preached the first of perhaps twenty sermons he wrote, some intended for publication. He did not finally visit Canterbury until 1557.<br>
<br>Pole was very busy, both supervising the reconstruction of the English church and frequently taking a significant part in council business at Mary's behest. The queen went so far as to propose making him chancellor, but the pope (and Pole) objected. Much of the cardinal's energy continued to go into re-establishing the church's finances and its legal position, although he did not neglect worship or doctrine: he was particularly interested in the restoration of monasticism, especially that of the Benedictines, whom he proposed to transfer to the Cassinese congregation. Pole took only a very small part in the campaign against heresy, continuing to object to the use of harsh methods. In instructions he wrote for his officials he ordered them to exonerate any heretic who would blame his errors on his bishop. John Foxe accurately noted that Pole was a papist, but &#145;none of the bloody and cruel sort of papists&#146;, not only because he restrained the bishop of London, &#145;Bloody&#146; Bonner, but also because of his &#145;solicitous writings&#146; to Cranmer, not to mention his own difficulties with Paul IV  (J. Foxe, <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>, 1563, p. 1973). Most dioceses were visited by legatine authority beginning immediately after the end of the synod, as were both universities (of which Pole was also vice-chancellor), Oxford in July&#150;August 1556 and Cambridge in January&#150;February 1557. Both resulted in injunctions and plans for new statutes, but the latter never appeared because Pole soon afterwards lost the legatine authority under which the visitations had been conducted.<h2>
<a name="ThestrugglewithPaulIV"></a>The struggle with Paul IV</h2>That blow fell on 9 April 1557 when all Pole's legatine powers were withdrawn, including those of a <i>legatus natus</i>, and he was recalled to Rome. This outcome would have been hard to predict at the beginning of Paul's pontificate, when Pole sounded almost as pleased by Carafa's election as he had in the case of the latter's predecessor, Marcellus II. Although it may be true that Paul was determined to prevent either Pole or Morone, the protector of England, from succeeding him by branding them heretics, contingent political circumstances led to his final falling out with the English cardinal. First, Pole apparently <i>de facto</i> lost his peace legation with the appointment of Scipione Rebiba in early 1556. Then, as the pope and Philip drifted towards war in the last months of the year, Pole tried to mediate but was often left without worthwhile instructions from Rome. Philip made the situation worse by treating him as one of his agents. In December 1556 Pole sent Henry Pyning on a personal mission to the pope urging him to make peace.<br>
<br>Philip's arrival in England in March 1557 undid Pole. He realized that he was in an impossible position, and tried to observe the forms by refusing to see Philip officially. They did, however, meet in private, as Pole scrupulously told the pope. He prolonged his withdrawal from court until commanded to return on pain of disgrace, an absence that probably fatally handicapped the peace party he led. On 12 May, when Sir Edward Carne had his second audience with the pope about the revocation of Pole's legation, Paul blamed it directly on Philip. Oddly, the pope also directed Carne to propose that the Inquisition take up the matter and said that if Mary wrote on Pole's behalf he would restore the legation. Similarly complex stalling consumed several months. Philip and Mary and parliament wrote on Pole's behalf, without effect. Pole himself also wrote, promising co-operation with a new legate. At almost the same time, on 31 May, Morone was incarcerated in Castel Sant' Angelo, and next day in consistory Paul named Pole as a suspect.<br>
<br>On 14 June 1557 the pope took the face-saving opportunity Pole had offered and replaced him as legate with William Peto, whom he made a cardinal on the same day. Six days later the breve recalling Pole was drawn up. Mary prevented the papal nuncio from bringing it to England and threatened another schism, although Pole claimed to have tried to have the nuncio admitted. In August, Pole sent his datary, Nicol&ograve; Ormanetto, to Rome, carrying a copy of a strongly worded apologia, together with instructions to tell the pope that he was ready to come to Rome to be imprisoned. Ormanetto arrived by 23 August and had an extraordinary audience with the pope on 4 September, submissively offering Pole's objections to the revocation. The apologia struck a quite different note. It opens with the claim that Pole could find no example of similar treatment of a cardinal and therefore had to rely on his conscience. Defensive points and rhetorical flourishes make up the body of the work, but Pole also offered the important argument that the cardinals were under obligation to resist the pope should he do anything to harm Christ's honour. Even after Ormanetto had brought the apologia to the pope Pole incorporated most of its content into the briefs which accompanied subsequent missions, especially Gianfrancesco Stella's. Small wonder that Philip's ministers showed themselves eager to lay hands on it once they decided soon after Pole's death that he was dangerous.<br>
<br>Perhaps Pole composed the apologia in his new apartments at Lambeth Palace, built in 1556 and 1557. He spent the largest part of his disposable income here, at least &pound;1000, perhaps as much as one third of his available funds. This provides the greatest exception to his otherwise ideologically motivated patronage. Foxe's conclusion is again acute: &#145;the pomp and glory of the world carried him away to play the papist thus as he did&#146;  (Foxe, 1973). Formerly a poor cardinal (that is, one without independent means and therefore eligible for a pension from the pope) and a leader of the &#145;spiritual&#146; wing of the church, Pole had attracted opposition in the conclave of Julius III because of the threat he posed to the idea of the church as another species of property. The account in <span class="italic">De antiquitate Britannicae ecclesiae</span> (1572) described his building as consisting of &#145;that long extension to the east &hellip; and a residence constructed to the east with lower and connected upper stories&#146;  (Parker, 419). Its Italianate loggia was one of the first such in England.<h2>
<a name="Theend"></a>The end</h2>By one of the articles of the treaty of Cave, between the pope and the Habsburgs, signed on 12&#150;14 September 1557, Pole's legation should have been restored. This seems never to have happened, although Pole did occasionally use his legatine seal thereafter, perhaps by mistake. If anything, Paul was more strongly opposed to Pole after the peace than before. Carnesecchi's summons to Rome as a suspected heretic now supplemented the Inquisition's investigation of Morone. The chief points objected against Pole were association with Flaminio and having read the <span class="italic">Beneficio</span>. The section <span class="italic">Disciplina Poli</span> (&#145;Pole's discipline&#146;) in the <span class="italic">Compendium processum sancti officii Romae</span> (&#145;Compendium of dossiers of the Holy Office of Rome&#146;) lists eighteen broad charges, from preaching heresy to fostering it in others, and concludes with two attacks against which defence would be almost impossible: Pole was thought suspect by serious witnesses, and he had been defamed among both heretics and Catholics. In December the pope moved directly against him, sending his nephew Carlo Carafa as legate to Philip in order to persuade the king of Pole's guilt. Carafa almost certainly carried a dossier and showed it to Bernardo Fresneda, the king's confessor. It is no longer extant, but Fresneda, earlier Pole's strong ally, thereafter became one of his worst enemies. Pole tried to intercede directly with Carafa in a letter of 14 December which repeated much of the apologia and followed it up with Stella's mission to Carafa in January 1558. The latter approach was made against the background of the loss of Calais on the 7th.<br>
<br>This traumatic event intensified the demands on Pole. In the depths of one of the worst crises to confront England in the sixteenth century, he was not only more than ever Mary's principal support, a leading member of the council, and still <i>de facto</i> head of the English church, but also had to direct the convocation that met in January. It dealt mainly with ecclesiastical finance and war, although an extensive list of articles, resembling the canons of the London synod but with greater stress on heresy, may have been discussed. Philip continued to support Pole, sending Count Feria to England. Feria found Pole a decent fellow but an incompetent governor, and famously labelled him a &#145;dead man&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, no. 413), partly as a result of Pole's coolness to Feria's efforts to introduce the Jesuits to England. They had been trying to gain entry since 1555. Pole probably refused them because of his preference for traditional forms of piety, especially that of the Benedictines, and there may also have been old scores between him and Ignatius of Loyola.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Pole launched a plan to enlist Fresneda's support, sending him a draft letter to the pope to forward if he thought it appropriate. Its major simile cast Pole in the likeness of Isaac. For the time being Philip was still in Pole's camp, agreeing to make every effort on his and Priuli's behalf, but Fresneda had set a spy on Pole, who was also damaged by the evidence almost daily turned up by the Inquisition's investigation of Morone. By the time Pole contracted his final illness in September 1558 his position had become almost impossible. Early that month he informed the king of his health and by the 23rd thought it necessary to commend the Italians in his household to Philip's protection. Nevertheless Pole summoned the energy to try to block Philip's plan concerning Elizabeth's accession. Feria persuaded Philip to drop his opposition, however, and on 14 November, Pole wrote his last letter to the princess, hoping to leave her &#145;satisfied of me&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Vesp. F. III, fol. 28). Pole's passion, as George Lily called it, ended on 17 November. Mary died first on that day and efforts were made to keep the news from Pole. Although very worried about the consequences of the queen's death, Pole consoled himself with his faith and confidence in providence. At the moment when he would have communicated had he been able, he asked to be assisted out of bed and, supported by two of his attendants, bowed his head almost to the floor. The scene reminded Priuli of a deposition of Christ, the body being supported by the two Marys.<br>
<br>Although he was Pole's long-time friend, Priuli also candidly recorded a series of sharp disagreements between them during the cardinal's final days, mainly about his will. Dated 4 October 1558, its principal content was a protestation of abiding loyalty to the papacy in general and Paul IV in particular. It recorded none of Pole's wishes for the disposition of his goods, a job left to Priuli and a few assistants. The will made a deep impact on some of Pole's supporters in Italy, especially Carnesecchi and Giulia Gonzaga, both of whom were deeply disappointed by it. Others rushed it into print as part of the effort to defend his reputation that began almost immediately after his death. Little is known of Pole's funeral. The body stayed at Lambeth until its removal by road to Canterbury on 10 December. The cart was decorated with bannerols worked in gold, banners of Pole's arms, and four more representing saints. The funeral took place on the 15th, with eulogies in both Latin and English on successive days. Only the first survives. It amounts to the first biography and was probably Lily's work. Pole was buried in Becket's Corona in Canterbury Cathedral in a simple chest tomb. A monument, now destroyed, was painted on the wall behind it by Dominic Lampson, a Fleming in Pole's household. Like Pole's building at Lambeth the work was highly classicized and contained many of the elements that would become conventional in English sculptural monuments in the next fifty years. Just as his household observed standards that would become those of Counter-Reformation cardinals, so did Pole's tomb also anticipate Counter-Reformation funerary monuments. It was restored between 1897 and 1900 by the Catholic Truth Society when the present cartouche of Pole's arms was painted by Edward Frampton RA.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandsignificance"></a>Personality and significance</h2>Nearly all observers agree on Pole's personal sanctity, but part company on how effectively he employed it. His first two biographers designed an influential &#145;Christian gentleman&#146; Pole, but almost equally often adopted was Vergerio's view of him as a coward. (The other contemporary assessment, Paul IV's of Pole as most heinous heretic, struck few later echoes.) The establishment of protestantism in England made Vergerio's interpretation popular, especially once it acquired semi-canonical status in Matthew Parker's <span class="italic">De antiquitate Britannicae ecclesiae</span> (first published 1572). The major touchstone of English attitudes to Pole was his treatment of Cranmer. Even Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who otherwise followed Foxe's moderate judgements, parted company with him on this point, while hastening to add that this was &#145;the only personal blemish I find laid on him&#146;  (Burnet, 2.525). Probably the most influential aspect of Parker's treatment was its condemnation of Pole as an &#145;inglese italianato&#146;, an Englishman seduced by effeminate, rhetorical, and, worst of all, papist Italians. The consequence has been the division of Pole's career into two parts. English writers (especially women&#151;Marie Hall&eacute;, writing as Martin Haile, produced one of the best biographies, aside from its bias) concentrated on his English career, while Italians and other Europeans found his life on the continent more compelling.<br>
<br>That his English career was Catholic and reached its apogee under one of the so-called &#145;little Tudors&#146; also prevented serious understanding of Pole. Both detractors and admirers gave insufficient attention either to the sources for Pole's life or to the shaping of his image. Despite the labours of Angelo Maria Querini on Pole's correspondence in the mid-eighteenth century, for example, his portrait of Pole remained hagiographic, as did Thomas Phillips's in his near plagiarism of Querini first published in 1764&#150;5. It touched off a major controversy, turning (as most such have done) on the relations between England and Rome.<br>
<br>Most biographies of Pole, with the possible exception of Wilhelm Schenk's brief post-war essay, remain hagiography. Only in the last thirty years of the twentieth century did critical studies begin to appear. One of these, Dermot Fenlon's of Pole in Italy (1972), portrayed a saintly but tortured soul. The other important book, by Paolo Simoncelli (1977), attempted to unmask Pole's &#145;myth of sanctity&#146;. Heinrich Lutz directed attention to Pole's peacemaking, and in 1981 produced the first critical edition of any of his writings. One of the most important modern contributions to the study of Pole has been the massive work of Massimo Firpo and Dario Marcatto on Morone's investigation. Study of Mary I's reign, too, has brought significant work on Pole, including Rex Pogson and T. F. Mayer on his legatine administration. The latter's full-length biography (2000) attempts to unite the two halves of Pole's life, ground it in the massive documentation, and take account of its literary dimensions.<br>
<br>Pole's early biographers came closest to getting their man when they insisted on his constancy, although it was not quite the kind they meant. Once he had an idea fixed in his head it was nearly impossible to dislodge it. Henry was an ogre, church property had to be returned, the pope was Peter's successor not as monarch but as martyr, justification came by faith. Yet at the same time, and as his biographers also stressed, Pole revelled in the joys of language. Despite his insistence that he was no author and never wrote for publication, his pen was his strongest weapon. His works and his patronage of writers helped to shape the historiography of the English Reformation. He left at least 3600 folio pages of manuscripts, the vast majority of them devoted to the single theme of resistance to encroachments on the individual (at least on the noble individual) by authorities of any kind. Pole shared his final line of defence with Luther: conscience. His household, bound to him by ideological and emotional ties rather than the usual material ones, provided him with a safe haven from which to mount his resistance. Of vital importance to his personality was his thirty-year relationship with Priuli, which might well be termed a marriage. This genius for intense friendship and for spiritual counsel suggests a private man. Yet he inherited a public position that many others thought had to be maintained, and which came to be converted into an even more exalted role in Rome.<br>
<br>Pole was one of the most important figures in Europe in his day, and as such he failed. Rather than the champion of papal monarchy which many of his admirers have thought they saw, he represents its doomed efforts to maintain position against the steady centralization of state power. It is intensely ironic that Pole made his greatest contribution to papal monarchy by helping to foster the Counter-Reformation, and that in Paul IV's hands the same movement almost destroyed him. Pole's plans for the English church, in advance of nearly any to be propounded on the continent, stressed discipline and regularity, a high standard of clerical education, and stout if gentle resistance to heresy. This may seem odd in light of his individualistic view of salvation, but accommodating justification by faith to a revivified institution was one of Pole's most significant achievements, albeit one with only a limited future. His religion was rooted in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, especially the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, and he modelled his behaviour on the prophets, above all Ezekiel. He combined this protestant attitude with a medieval and Catholic monastic spirituality. It was Pole's tragedy that his circumstances not only did not allow the private and the public to mesh, but also almost split him apart. The only refuge left was writing another world.<br>
