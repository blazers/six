<span class="headword">Spelman, Sir  John</span>  (1594&#150;1643), <span class="occ">royalist author</span>, was born in Hunstanton, Norfolk, the eldest son of the historian and antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26104/', "Sir Henry Spelman (1563/4&#150;1641)")</script> and Eleanor L'Estrange (<i>d</i>. 1620). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26102/', "Clement Spelman")</script> was his younger brother. He was admitted at Gray's Inn on 16 February 1608 and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, the following year. About 1620 he married Anne Townshend, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66940/', "Anne Townshend, Lady Townshend")</script>. He represented the City of Worcester in the 1626 parliament. He had inherited his father's literary and antiquarian interests, and he made several trips abroad, including to Paris (1619) and Italy (1628&#150;9), during which he met a number of continental scholars. He also published, from manuscripts in his father's library, <span class="italic">Psalterium Davidis Latino-Saxonicum vetus</span> (1640).<br>
<br>Spelman, who was knighted on 18 December 1641, sat in neither the Short nor Long parliament and in January 1642 Charles I ordered him to remain in Norfolk. However, Spelman was later summoned to Oxford, where he occupied rooms in Brasenose College while he studied there. During 1642&#150;3 he published four tracts which eloquently express moderate royalist political and religious attitudes, and which constitute his principal claim to fame.<br>
<br>In the earliest of these, <span class="italic">A Protestants Account of his Orthodox Holding in Matters of Religion</span> (1642), Spelman presented a sustained defence of existing forms of church government. He attacked the exponents of root-and-branch reform as &#145;fighters against the Spirit of God&#146; and insisted that &#145;the liturgy of our Church&#146; had been established &#145;by the laws of this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Protestants Account</span>, 23&#150;4). A similar concern for the rule of law loomed equally large in Spelman's other treatises. In <span class="italic">Certain considerations upon the duties both of prince and people, written by a gentleman of quality, a wel-wisher both to the king and parliament</span> (1642), he argued, in terms reminiscent of the king's <span class="italic">Answer to the Nineteen Propositions</span>, that &#145;the composite forme&#146; was &#145;the only firme and durable forme&#146;, and that &#145;of the three powers, regall, aristocraticall or popular, any of them prevailing so far as to be wholly free from being qualified or tempered by some operation of the other two, corrupted the legitimate forme into a tyrannicall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Certain Considerations</span>, 18). The monarch's authority was therefore not &#145;without law&#146; but subject to limitations: the laws were &#145;most sacred and binding even to Kings themselves&#146;. However, this was &#145;to be understood in safety, in honour, in conscience betweene God and them&#146;, and there was no way that &#145;in their default, the people can become authorised&#146;  (ibid., 18&#150;20).<br>
<br>This last point in turn led Spelman to compose a refutation of Henry Parker's <span class="italic">Observations</span>, entitled <span class="italic">A View of a Printed Book Intituled &#145;Observations upon His Majesties Late Answers and Expresses&#146;</span> (1642). Spelman began by insisting that although the king and the houses of parliament formed one body, &#145;yet is the King the head of that body&#146;  (<span class="italic">A View of a Printed Book</span>, 8). This was not to claim &#145;a power to make lawes and lay taxes without the consent of Parliament&#146;, but only &#145;a negative voice, that they without him may not make any lawes, or charge his subjects, but that all be done by the joynt consent of him and his people&#146;  (ibid., 23). Although certain powers, such as control over the militia, were &#145;by the fundamentall law immovably setled in the Crowne&#146;  (ibid., sig. F3<i>r</i>), Spelman wrote that:<blockquote>monarchy &hellip; tempered and mixt &hellip; is the constitution of government in England, so well poysed and molded by the wisdome of our ancestors as that it gives to this kingdome the conveniences of all [forms] without the inconveniences of any one. (ibid., sig. E2<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Spelman developed these points at greater length in his last political work, <span class="italic">The case of our affaires, in law, religion, and other circumstances briefly examined, and presented to the conscience</span> (1643). He reiterated that &#145;even by the declaration of our lawes&#146;, the king was &#145;a supreme head, a soveraigne&#146;, whose crown was &#145;an imperiall crown, the kingdom <i>his</i> kingdom, <i>his</i> realme, <i>his</i> dominion, the people <i>his</i> people, the subject <i>his</i> subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Case of our Affaires</span>, 1). Hence &#145;the soveraignity of this State&#146; was &#145;clearly vested in the King, by law established in him, and inseparably annexed to his person&#146;  (ibid., 2). By the same token, the houses of parliament were &#145;meerly instruments of regulation and qualification of the King's legislative absolutenesse&#146; and &#145;no sharers with him in the soveraignity&#146;. Royal powers were thus &#145;not as properly said to be restrained as regulated&#146;  (ibid., 5). Here, as in his other writings, Spelman argued that mixed monarchy did not imply shared sovereignty, and that the concept of legally limited monarchy involved a regulation rather than a restriction of the monarch's powers.<br>
<br>While resident in Oxford, Spelman also compiled <span class="italic">Alfredi magni Anglorum regis invictissimi vita</span>, published posthumously in 1678. Spelman's abilities won the king's favour and he was about to be appointed secretary of state when he died of camp fever on 25 July 1643, at Brasenose. He was buried in Great St Mary's Church the next day, and James Ussher preached his funeral sermon.<br>
