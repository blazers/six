<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Buckmaster,  Maurice James</span>  (1902&#150;1992), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and businessman</span>, was born on 11 January 1902 at Ravenhill, Brereton, Staffordshire, the son of Henry James Buckmaster (<i>c</i>.1857&#150;1943), brewer, and his wife, Eva Matilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nason (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1868). He was educated at Eton College from 1915 to 1920 and secured a classics exhibition to Magdalen College, Oxford, but lack of money stopped him from continuing his academic studies. Instead, he taught French to schoolchildren, worked briefly for <span class="italic">France Soir</span>, and spent six years at J. Henry Schroeder &amp; Co., merchant bankers, in London. On 2 July 1927 he married May Dorothy Steed (<i>b</i>. 1904/5), daughter of Frederick Othnill Steed, silk merchant; they had a son and two daughters. In 1929 Buckmaster began his long association with Ford Motors. He was personal assistant to the chairman of the English branch for three years, from 1932 to 1936 managed Ford SA France, and then spent three years as head of the European department at Dagenham.<br>
<br>Buckmaster was commissioned into the intelligence corps in October 1939, and after a war intelligence course at Minley Manor and a course on photographic interpretation at Farnborough was posted as an intelligence officer to 50 division in the British expeditionary force in France. He was mentioned in dispatches for services in that role during the retreat to Dunkirk, from which he was evacuated on 2 June 1940. He served as a liaison officer at Weymouth during the battle of Britain, and then joined the Dakar expedition as a GSO3 (intelligence). After it failed, he rejoined 50 division, and was briefly an instructor on the intelligence course at Bridgwater.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1941, on the invitation of Gerald Templer, Buckmaster joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE) with the rank of major, and spent the summer on courses. He then, after a brief spell in the Belgian section, became head of the independent French (F) section in November 1941. On 18 December the same year, his first marriage having ended in divorce, he married Anna Cecilia Frances Stevenson (1903/4&#150;1988), daughter of Michael Reinstein, of independent means, and divorced wife of Aubrey Melford Steed Stevenson. She was thereafter his constant companion at home, but could know nothing of his secret work. This consisted in finding, training, and dispatching to France&#151;usually by parachute&#151;men and women who could pass for French, who would prepare tasks of sabotage and subversion that would assist an eventual British armed re-entry into France. They came, as Buckmaster came, under the orders of the chiefs of staff, passed down through SOE's command channels (Buckmaster, often wrongly described as SOE's head, stood four steps down its staff ladder). He had fluent French (spoken with an English accent) and friendly manners, but no direct experience of Nazi occupation methods, and too little detailed information from &#145;the field&#146; about what life in France was currently like.<br>
<br>Buckmaster's section sent nearly 500 agents into France, over 100 of whom died, either in action or in concentration camps. Eighteen of them were dropped, unperceived by Buckmaster, directly into Gestapo hands. General de Gaulle strongly disapproved of their presence, but they inflicted substantial damage on the enemy and on French collaborators, imposing for example substantial delays on reinforcements for the Normandy front in June 1944. After the liberation of France in September 1944, Buckmaster, by now promoted full colonel, made a progress round that country, thanking those who had supported his leading agents, and he made sure that his men and women secured plenty of decorations, including three George crosses (all for women) and over a score of appointments to the DSO. He was himself made a civil OBE in 1943, and a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1945 (promoted officier in 1978).<br>
<br>Buckmaster was released from the army late in 1945 and returned to Ford, for whom he worked in England for another fifteen years, first as head of the European department, then, from 1950, as director of public relations. From 1960 he was a freelance publicity consultant, specializing in champagne imports, and was much in demand in France at reunions of those who had worked with him. The &#145;<i>r&eacute;seaux</i> <i>Buck</i>&#146; (Buck networks) are now established as part of French resistance history, and several towns have streets named after him. He published two books, <span class="italic">Specially Employed</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">They Fought Alone</span> (1958), crammed with anecdotes, most of them true, though few of them applied to the correct places and agents. His health began to fail when he was in his eighties and he retired from London to Forest Row in Sussex. He died at his home there, the Walhatch Country Hotel, of heart failure, on 17 April 1992. He was survived by the three children of his first marriage. A memorial service was held at Holy Trinity, Brompton, on 2 July 1992.<br>
