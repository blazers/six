<span class="headword">Warner,  Richard</span>  (1763&#150;1857), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 18 October 1763 at St Marylebone, Middlesex, the only son of Richard Warner, a tradesman prosperous enough to retire about 1776 to Lymington in Hampshire as a gentleman with a substantial house. Lymington was dominated by the family of the younger Richard's friend Sir Henry Burrard Neale (1765&#150;1840). Warner attended Christchurch grammar school and familiarized himself with the New Forest and its antiquities: he even excavated some barrows. He intended to enter the church, but his chosen route&#151;from Winchester College to New College, Oxford, and a fellowship&#151;proved unattainable. Only in 1787, after a period spent in an attorney's office, did he enter St Mary's Hall, Oxford; he left after eight terms without a degree, apparently to take up a curacy at Boldre, Hampshire. Here he served under the Revd William Gilpin (1724&#150;1804), an enthusiastic walker and admirer of New Forest scenery, who could no longer minister to his parishioners himself. Gilpin became a close friend, a fatherly patron, and a formative literary influence. Since the bishop of Winchester, Brownlow North, would not ordain a non-graduate, Warner was ordained instead by Archbishop William Markham of York. He served three months as curate of Wales, near Doncaster, before returning to Boldre. About 1793 he became curate of Fawley, the valuable living of the Revd Henry Drummond of Cadland.<br>
<br>Warner's early publications were prodigious, if ephemeral. Unlike his mentor, Gilpin, his interests were antiquarian rather than picturesque. He wanted fame, but also wrote for money. Although his <span class="italic">Companion in a Tour Round Lymington</span> (1789) lost him &pound;22 5<i>s</i>., he followed it immediately with a translation of the Hampshire <span class="roman">Domesday</span>, published in the same year. His <span class="italic">Southampton Guide</span> (1790) made a profit of &pound;5, but his <span class="italic">Antiquitates culinariae</span> (1791) involved him in costs and damages of &pound;70 for pirating a print. His scholarly <span class="italic">Attempt to Ascertain the Site of the Ancient Clausentum</span> (1792) was followed by his two-volume <span class="italic">Topographical Remarks on the South-Western Parts of Hampshire</span> (1793), his brief &#145;General view of the agriculture of the Isle of Wight&#146; in the larger Hampshire volume (1794), and, in 1795, <span class="italic">A History of the Isle of Wight</span>. In the same year, he published a Gothic novel about Netley Abbey, which was well received (as were the four preceding publications). He also proposed a full-scale three-volume history of Hampshire, but although there were enough subscribers by 1793, he abandoned the project on grounds of expense. Warner's so-called <span class="italic">History of Hampshire</span> of 1795 was in fact the worthless compilation of another anonymous author.<br>
<br>In 1794 Warner became the first minister of All Saints, Bath, a curacy of Walcot, before moving next year to the officiating ministership of St James's, Bath, a curacy of Bath Abbey, where he remained until 1817. At once he immersed himself in the history, environs, and literary society of Bath, where he became a prominent figure and a frequent correspondent in the <span class="italic">Bath Journal</span>. The town's neglected Roman past stimulated his <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Roman Antiquities at Bath</span> (1797) and his full-scale <span class="italic">History of Bath</span> in 1801.<br>
<br>Warner's vacation in August 1796 was spent in Wales, walking from Bath to Caernarfon and back; he covered 36 miles on the first day and 462 miles in all, at an average of 26 miles a day. Naturally his tour included visits to antiquities, which he described in a series of eighteen letters, published as <span class="italic">A Walk through Wales</span> in 1797. Emboldened by the popularity of this work, he published works based on walks in Wales, the south-west, and the borders in 1798&#150;1802; these reached further and even foreign editions. Warner's marriage to Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Pearson) in 1801 and fatherhood in 1802 may henceforth have focused his attention once again on Bath: in 1807&#150;9 he published three satirical volumes on local society, under the pseudonyms of Peter Paul Pallet and Thomas Goosequill.<br>
<br>Warner &#145;distinguished himself by his worthy endeavour to inculcate rational piety&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 100/1, 1830, 612): St James's Church was always crowded, and his sermons were &#145;models of pulpit eloquence&#146;. Starting with a <span class="italic">Chronological History of our Lord and Saviour: an English Diatessaron</span> (1803), his religious publications included practical discourses, sermons, companions, and introductions. He was a political reformer, a supporter of Fox and the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>. As an opponent of the younger Pitt, in 1804 he gave the sermon &#145;War inconsistent with Christianity&#146; to volunteers destined for service abroad. Warner objected to evangelicalism for encouraging disrespect to the church:<blockquote>I conceive the <i>Evangelical Clergy</i> as a body of the established priesthood, separating themselves from their brethren of the ministry, by the arrogant claim of an exclusive <i>knowledge of the Gospel</i>, and as a sole right to be considered as <i>evangelical</i> preachers. (<span class="italic">Letter to the Hon. and Rt Rev. Henry Ryder</span>, 15)</blockquote>He also opposed Catholic emancipation, belittling the supposed ills of Catholics under Britain's constitution. From 1824 he found a sympathetic patron in Dr George Law (<i>d</i>. 1845), bishop of Bath and Wells.<br>
<br>According to the Revd Joseph Hunter, the Unitarian minister of Bath and a fellow antiquary, Warner's &#145;liberality of sentiment &hellip; stood in the way of his advancement&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 26527 fol. 134). He remained at Bath on presentation in 1809 by Burrard Neale to Great Chalfield rectory, worth only &pound;62 a year, but resigned his curacy on presentation to Norton St Philip with Hinton Charterhouse in 1817. After remaining there only a year, he lived at Widcombe Cottage, Bath, from 1818 to 1822, when he let it to reside briefly at Great Chalfield. He moved subsequently to Newton St Loe (1822&#150;7), Coltard, near Pensford (1827), and Castle Cary (1830). Surviving letters to Hunter illuminate his work on his <span class="italic">History of &hellip; Glaston: and &hellip; Town of Glastonbury</span> (1826), which he dedicated to Bishop Law. Law collated him in 1825&#150;7 in turn to Timberscombe (worth &pound;222), Croscombe (&pound;170), and Chelwood by Bath (&pound;200), where he apparently resided from 1833 to 1847. Though retaining Great Chalfield and Chelwood rectories until his death, Warner had retired by 1848 and died on 27 July 1857 at his home, Widcombe Cottage, Chelwood, where his long-blind widow died in 1865. He was buried on 11 August 1857 in Chelwood church. Of the Warners' two daughters, Ellen Rebecca died in 1833 and Elizabeth Sophia outlived them both.<br>
<br>Warner wrote with great facility and parade of learning, but his works were commercial rather than scholarly, and as such were often derivative and inaccurate. Hunter observed that &#145;he was deep in no subject. He had read little, made no particular preparations for publication, and began to read in a subject only when he had previously determined to publish upon it&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 26527, fol. 134). His histories of Bath and Glastonbury were useful compilations, but they left their subjects as Warner had found them.<br>
