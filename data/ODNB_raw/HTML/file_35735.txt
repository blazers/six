<span class="headword">Richards,  Francis John</span>  (1901&#150;1965), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born on 1 October 1901 at Newton Road, Burton upon Trent, the third child of Robert Richards, a retail butcher, and his wife, Mary Ann Mayger. Frank Richards was educated at Burton grammar school where he was an outstanding pupil and where an early interest in biology, fostered at home, was developed by an enthusiastic schoolmaster. He also showed an early talent for mathematics. He was awarded a major borough scholarship and in 1921 he went to the University of Birmingham, whence he graduated BSc in 1924 with first-class honours in botany. After eighteen months as a demonstrator he obtained his MSc; he was later awarded the DSc for published work.<br>
<br>In 1926 Richards joined the Research Institute of Plant Physiology at Imperial College, London, under the general direction of Professor V. H. Blackman, to assist F. G. Gregory, later director of the institute, in investigations of the mineral nutrition of barley. After six months in London he moved to Harpenden, where field facilities were provided at Rothamsted Experimental Station. He remained in Harpenden for thirty-five years. When responsibility for the institute passed from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Agricultural Research Council he became a principal scientific officer, subsequently, by two special merit promotions, becoming senior principal scientific officer and deputy chief scientific officer (1963). In 1928 Richards married Lilian Kingsley Mason, daughter of a Burton timber merchant. They had two daughters and led a quiet domestic life in Harpenden.<br>
<br>At Harpenden, Richards gradually took over from Gregory responsibility for the nutritional aspects of the institute's research and for training research students in plant physiology, in which he himself continued to work throughout his career. On Gregory's retirement in December 1958 the institute was disbanded. To provide for the continuation of Richards's work a research unit was set up, with Richards himself as director. The unit was based at Wye College, Kent (University of London), and Richards moved there in 1961, accompanied by his senior colleague, W. W. Schwabe.<br>
<br>In 1929 Richards published (with Gregory) in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> the first of a series of papers on the mineral nutrition of barley which indirectly contributed much to modern fertilizer practice. Making meticulous measurements and exploiting R. A. Fisher's new techniques for statistical interpretation, he established the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium deficiencies on assimilation and respiration rates of barley leaves. Subsequent studies examined the roles of phosphorus and potassium in protein synthesis and in the general nitrogen metabolism of plants. He demonstrated that the amine putrescine, itself toxic, was produced as the ionic substitute for a lack of potassium.<br>
<br>Richards took an interest, which possibly arose from his mathematical inclination, in the problem of the patterns of leaf arrangements in plants&#151;phyllotaxis. His studies led to a new understanding of the relations between the growth of the shoot tip and organ formation. He devised a means of defining the patterns&#151;the <span class="roman">Phyllotaxis Index</span> for plane projection and the <span class="roman">Equivalent Phyllotaxis Index</span> for a conical surface. As a result it became possible to describe phyllotactic systems in terms of radial distances from the centre of the growing point and the angular divergence between primordia which was free from implied hypotheses about the origin of the system. While Richards did not proceed to prove formally the necessity of the Fibonacci angle being the limiting divergence, his contributions, published in several papers, stimulated renewed interest in this, perhaps the oldest, problem of plant morphogenesis. Richards was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1954.<br>
<br>While still a student Richards had joined a volunteer party to assist Professor R. H. Yapp in a study of the salt marshes of the Dovey estuary of which an important aspect was the vertical accretion of the sward association. After Yapp's death Richards completed the project and published the results in 1934. His use of statistical methods in the analysis of the data was pioneering in ecological studies.<br>
<br>Richards was a modest man with a diffident manner which concealed remarkable talents and a wide range of general as well as biological knowledge. His reluctance to express his views restricted his influence, but his colleagues had deep respect for his shrewd analytical mind and clarity of thought. Richards had a number of hobbies. As examples, he assembled and mounted a superb collection of Lepidoptera and made a collection of palaeolithic artefacts from the classical fields of Rothamsted; he also made a reflecting telescope, grinding the parabolic mirror himself. Soon after the move to Wye Richards's health began to deteriorate and he died there, at his home, Orchard Bank, Oxenturn Road, on 2 January 1965.<br>
