<span class="headword">Feild <span class="st"> [Felde]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1587), <span class="occ">astrologer and compiler of almanacs</span>, was the son of Richard Felde (<i>d</i>. 1542), a gentleman, of East Ardsley, Yorkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. Since he was named as an executor to his father's will of 1542, he was probably born about 1520. Nothing is known of his upbringing and no evidence has been found to support Anthony Wood's claim that he was educated at Oxford.<br>
<br>In the 1550s Feild was in London as an associate, perhaps a pupil, of the mathematician and philosopher John Dee. In 1555 both were arrested as part of a group suspected of conjuring and witchcraft. From references to their &#145;lewd and vain practices of calculing or conjuring&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1554&#150;6</i>, 143), it seems likely that they were accused of casting royal horoscopes, particularly that of Queen Mary. Feild was detained in the custody of the bishop of London but presumably released after examination.<br>
<br>His connection with Dee and his astrological interests are prominent in Feild's only two publications. Both were almanacs calculated for and published in London: <span class="italic">Ephemeris anni 1557 currentis iuxta Copernici et Reinhaldi canones</span> (1556) and <span class="italic">Ephemerides trium annorum</span> (1558) for the years 1558&#150;60. The works are comprised chiefly of astronomical tables, principally dedicated to providing information on the daily positions of the planets for the purposes of astrological calculation. The 1557 ephemeris opens with a letter from John Dee criticizing ordinary almanac makers for their inaccurate tables and their failure to benefit from the work of Copernicus and his followers Rheticus and Reinhold. Dee had encouraged Feild to produce a more reliable alternative. Feild's own preface, signed &#145;Londini ex musaeo nostro&#146;, emphasizes the errors which had arisen in judicial astrology from reliance on the Alphonsine tables. He states that he has based his calculations on Copernicus and Reinhold, &#145;whose writings are established and founded on true, certain and sincere demonstrations&#146;.<br>
<br>Such references to Copernicus led to Feild's being labelled a &#145;proto-Copernican&#146; by the nineteenth-century antiquary Joseph Hunter, who discovered Feild while conducting genealogical research on his own family tree. But, despite the apparent approval, there is no indication that Feild accepted Copernicus's heliocentric cosmology; as his work is based on Reinhold's tables, it is not possible to be certain whether he had gone back beyond Reinhold to his source in Copernicus. Like most of his astronomical contemporaries who were aware of Copernicus, Feild most probably considered the latter to have provided the basis for a restored mathematical astronomy and more accurate tables of celestial phenomena rather than a new natural philosophical account of the heavens.<br>
<br>On 4 September 1558 Feild received confirmation of his family's arms as well as the grant of a crest featuring an astronomical motif: an arm issuing from clouds and holding an armillary sphere. About 1560 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1609), the daughter of John Amyas, a Kentish gentleman. By 1577 they had settled in East Ardsley, and he had returned to the gentry network of his birth. In the Yorkshire visitation of 1585 he recorded the names of his wife and nine children, and in his will he describes himself as &#145;fermor, sometymes studente in the mathematicall sciences&#146;. His death occurred between writing his will, dated 28 December 1586, and its probate, on 3 May 1587. He was buried in the porch of Ardsley Church. His library passed into the hands of the physician William Coley of York, who afterwards returned it to the family.<br>
