<span class="headword">Maghfeld,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1397), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was of unknown parentage, and no details of his early years, whether in London or elsewhere, have been traced. He trained as an ironmonger and was elected by his fellow ironmongers in London to represent them in the reforming council assembled in 1376. He seems to have prospered quickly, in particular as a merchant in wholesale and overseas trade. He and his wife, Margery, lived in some style with their cook and other servants and a staff to deal with the business. Their home was on part of a valuable leased property with a wharf in the parish of St Botolph, Billingsgate, and with associates and his brother Geoffrey he extended his holdings and invested in land in nearby counties. He acquired two wardships, one of which brought him control of valuable manors in Kent.<br>
<br>Maghfeld's unique position in the history of late medieval London, however, is due to the survival among the records of the exchequer of one of his ledgers, that kept from 4 July 1390 to 23 June 1395. Maghfeld or his clerk noted, day by day, debts and expenses, cancelling them when settled. Much illuminating detail on aspects of medieval life can be drawn from this volume of forty-seven folios, written chiefly in French, on subjects ranging from the costs of the schooling of two small boys&#151;one of whom, William, may have been Maghfeld's son&#151;to wages for those laying paving tiles in a local church.<br>
<br>The ledger is of the greatest importance for the light it sheds on the business activities of a London merchant. Some of the debts&#151;over eighty debtors are named, some carried over from an earlier ledger&#151;represent straightforward loans. Some of these were sizeable, and were repaid in instalments, sometimes long after the agreed term; others, like the 26<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. borrowed by Geoffrey Chaucer one Sunday in July 1392 and repaid as arranged the following Saturday, involved only relatively small sums. Much of Maghfeld's trade was with south-west Europe, whence his agents dispatched iron, wines, and other products, while cargoes of grain and cloth were shipped to Bayonne. He was well placed at Billingsgate to handle imports of fish and other raw materials such as woad and alum, essential for the cloth industry. While London was his chief market he had contacts as far away as Suffolk and Hampshire. Credit played an essential part in the exchange of goods, although the interest involved is not noted in the ledger.<br>
<br>Maghfeld's financial skills were soon recognized at court. From 1383 he was active on royal business, particularly as collector of customs duties at Boston, Southampton, and London. He was among those to whom Richard II turned for help when he quarrelled with London in 1392. The mayor and leading citizens were summoned to account for disorder, and at councils held in June and July Richard over-rode long-established privileges. He sent the mayor and sheriffs to prison, appointed a warden and sheriffs to rule the city, and imposed a heavy fine. Although Maghfeld, after brief service in 1382, had been elected alderman of the ward of Billingsgate only in the previous March, Richard appointed him on 25 June 1392 one of the two sheriffs, and on 23 July collector of the London wool customs duties. Richard's favour was partly regained by the city by substantial gifts and loans, and when free elections were allowed Londoners found it politic to put forward Maghfeld's name again as sheriff on 21 September 1392. He continued as alderman and customs collector until 1396/7. But his position was not a comfortable one: the city continued to hold its privileges at the royal pleasure.<br>
<br>The impact of his responsibilities on Maghfeld's own finances is clearly shown by the ledger. There was a marked decline in his trading activities, losses for which moneylending could not compensate. Royal favour seems to have harmed his relations with his fellow merchants and therefore his credit. Although he was able to buy a ship and its gear in September 1395, arrears on customs duties for the year 1395/6 led to the seizure of his possessions, including his ledger, on his death in May 1397. He may not then have been worth more than about &pound;500, judging from debts for which the king sought payment. No will is extant.<br>
