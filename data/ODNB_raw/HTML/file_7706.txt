<span class="headword">Dixon,  Thomas</span>  (1679/80&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and college teacher</span>, was probably the son of an episcopalian, but not, as formerly believed, of Thomas Dixon (<i>d</i>. 1704), who was ejected from the vicarage of Kelloe, co. Durham, as a nonconformist. Dixon studied at Manchester dissenting academy under John Chorlton and James Coningham, probably from 1700 to 1704. While a student, he wrote to Edmund Calamy &#145;in a state of suspense between conformity and nonconformity&#146;  (McLachlan, 133). His first ministerial appointment was at Colchester in 1704.<br>
<br>Before October 1705 Dixon had succeeded Roger Anderton as minister of a congregation at Whitehaven, founded by presbyterians from the north of Ireland and meeting in a &#145;chapel for the use of protestant presbyterian or congregational dissenters in the worship of God in their way, so long as the law alloweth thereof&#146;. Having obtained a bond on 21 September 1708, he married Eleanor Stanger, daughter of the ruling elder at Cockermouth Independent Church, who no doubt subsequently acted as matron of the boarding establishment of his academy. In a trust deed of March 1711 he is described as &#145;Thomas Dixon, clerk&#146;. The academy Dixon established at Whitehaven was for the education mainly of students for the ministry. He probably acted under the advice of Calamy, whom he accompanied on his journey to Scotland in April 1709. During his visit to Edinburgh, Dixon received (21 April 1709) the honorary degree of MA, with Calamy receiving a DD at the same time. Dixon took with him two students, including Jeremiah Sawrey of Broughton Tower, near Coniston, a grandson of Dr Richard Gilpin. The academy was in operation in 1710, and on the removal of Coningham from the Manchester academy in 1712, it became the leading nonconformist academy in the north of England. Mathematics was taught by John Barclay until 1714, when there may have been a partial suspension of activities due to the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span>. Among Dixon's pupils were John Taylor, of the Hebrew concordance, George Benson, the biblical critic, Caleb Rotheram, who became head of the Kendal academy, and Henry Winder, author of the <span class="italic">History of Knowledge</span>. In 1712 Dixon provided particulars of Cumberland and Westmorland congregations to John Evans, who recorded them in his manuscripts. During his residence at Whitehaven he was the leading nonconformist in the county, and secured aid from the Presbyterian Fund for many of his brethren.<br>
<br>In 1722 or 1723 Dixon moved to Bank Street Chapel, Bolton, Lancashire, as successor to the minister Samuel Bourn (1648&#150;1719). He still continued his academy, and educated several ministers, including Thomas Butterworth. On 20 May 1718 he had been awarded an MD by King's College, Aberdeen, and he is said to have attained a considerable medical practice in Bolton. Probably this accumulation of duties in a steadily growing town shortened his life. His congregation exceeded 1000, and was second only to Manchester in the county. He died at the manse, Bank Street, Bolton, on 14 August 1729, in his fiftieth year, and was buried in his meeting-house. There, a mural tablet erected to his memory by his elder son, Richard Dixon, also a medical practitioner, characterizes him as &#145;facile medicorum et theologorum princeps&#146; (&#145;easily chief amongst physicians and theologians&#146;).<br>
<br>Dixon's younger son, <a name="cosubject_7707"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Dixon</span>  (1721&#150;1754), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born on 16 July 1721 and educated for the ministry in Caleb Rotheram's academy at Kendal, which he entered in 1738, having received a student grant from the Presbyterian Fund. His first settlement was at Thame, Oxfordshire, from 1743, on a salary of &pound;25 a year. On 13 May 1750 he became assistant to Dr John Taylor at Norwich. Here, at Taylor's suggestion, he began a Greek concordance, on the plan of Taylor's Hebrew one, but the manuscript fragments of the work show that not much was done. He found it difficult to satisfy the demands of a fastidious congregation, and gladly accepted, in August 1752, a call to his father's former flock at Bolton. He was not ordained until 26 April 1753. With John Seddon of Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, then the only Socinian preacher in the district, he maintained a warm friendship, and is believed to have shared his views, though his publications are silent in regard to the person of Christ. According to Nightingale, his heterodox views led to a secession which assisted in the formation of the Duke's Alley Congregational Church. Dixon was also tolerant towards Methodism: Nightingale quotes a letter from Dixon, stating &#145;I think the Methodists behaving peaceably should not be molested&#146;  (Nightingale, <span class="italic">Lancashire Nonconformity</span>, 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>Dixon died on 23 February 1754 and was buried beside his father. Joshua Dobson of Cockey Moor preached his funeral sermon. His friend Seddon edited from his papers a posthumous tract, <span class="italic">The sovereignty of the divine administration &hellip; a rational account of our blessed Saviour's temptation</span>, which was published in a second edition in 1766. In 1810 William Turner of Newcastle had two quarto volumes, in shorthand, containing Dixon's notes on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>.<br>
