<span class="headword">Collinson,  Francis James Montgomery</span>  (1898&#150;1984), <span class="occ">musical director and musicologist</span>, was born on 20 January 1898 at Coates House, Manor Place, Edinburgh, the third of five children (three sons, two daughters) of Thomas Henry Collinson (1858&#150;1928), organist at St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh, and his wife, Annie Wyness Scott (<i>d</i>. 1939). His father was Northumbrian, his mother Scottish. He attended Daniel Stewart's College, Edinburgh, leaving in 1914 to serve an apprenticeship under his father at St Mary's, where Francis had been a chorister. During the First World War he served for three years in motor transport in the Army Service Corps (having first been a Red Cross volunteer). On demobilization in 1919 he matriculated in music studies at Edinburgh University, studying under Professor Sir Donald Tovey. He threw himself into university musical life, playing in and conducting the Reid Orchestra, conducting the student Yahoo Orchestra (which he developed into a large-scale theatre orchestra), and composing the annual musical show run by the student representative council, the S. R. Ceenium. In the orchestra was his future wife, the law student Elizabeth Grant (1898&#150;1983), whose grandfather had established the well-known Banffshire whisky distilling firm. He was described in the student magazine as the pleasantest person to work with in the university, honest, hardworking, efficient, tactful, and accommodating, yet stubborn and principled when necessary. His remarkable ability to compose, orchestrate, and rehearse to tight schedules&#151;while not neglecting his studies&#151;was matched by a rapidly assimilated knowledge of stage management, and although it clearly ran against the grain of his musical upbringing it is perhaps not surprising that after gaining a MusBac in 1923 he sought his fortune in the sphere of musical entertainment in London, marrying Elizabeth there on 3 March 1925. Their only child, Margaret Anne, was born in 1936.<br>
<br>A quiet, gentle man, Collinson nevertheless managed to find a number of jobs as chorus master, including for the revival of John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at the Lyric, Hammersmith. He had the good fortune to be employed to copy out the band parts for Nigel Playfair's review <span class="italic">Riverside Night</span> when the musical director, Alfred Reynolds, fell ill at the first rehearsal; Playfair asked Collinson to take Reynolds's place. He was thus launched on a successful career as a conductor and director of musical comedy and revue (recalling in later life that he was strongly advised to keep quiet about actually possessing a degree in music), working eventually for many years with the famous impresario C. B. Cochran and his equally famous Cochran's Young Ladies. He was catholic and eclectic in his musical career, and was proud not only of having conducted for both Cole Porter and Richard Tauber, but also of having restored William Walton's <span class="italic">Ballet</span> from a single piano score when the original music was destroyed in the London blitz. In 1941 he published the acclaimed <span class="italic">Orchestration for the Theatre</span>, with an introduction by Cochran; it was reprinted in 1949.<br>
<br>Theatre and revue were badly hit by the advent of the Second World War and in 1941 Collinson took charge of the BBC's <span class="italic">Country Magazine</span> programmes, with their famous signature tune, &#145;The Painful Plough&#146;, of which he was to make many arrangements, including one for the bagpipe. The programmes, many of them outside broadcasts, involved Collinson in the study, collection, and arrangement of folk-songs (bringing the Copper family to public attention, for example) throughout Britain. He not only published these arrangements in a series with Francis Dillon from 1946 onwards but also issued three unique 78 r.p.m. recordings of folk-songs in the Gramophone Company's <span class="roman">Plum Label</span> series. Now collector's items, the songs were beautifully delivered by the baritone Robert Irwin, accompanied by an orchestra conducted by Collinson. He composed a wide range of music, mainly for broadcasting, from &#145;folk&#146; orchestral suites to musical comedy, and won the Italia prize in 1950 for his <span class="italic">Rumpelstiltskin</span>.<br>
<br>In 1951 Edinburgh University established the School of Scottish Studies, and Collinson was invited back as the first musical research fellow, concentrating on the collection, study, and transcription of traditional song in both Scots and Gaelic. This he carried out in his customary scrupulous and meticulous manner, and in 1966 he made his name in the field of traditional music with his comprehensive and scholarly book <span class="italic">The Traditional and National Music of Scotland</span>. Thereafter, under the editorship of the great Gaelic folklorist John Lorne Campbell (1906&#150;1996) he brought out three volumes of <span class="italic">Hebridean Folksongs</span> (1969, 1977, and 1981), presenting to the world genuine Gaelic traditional song, previously traduced and popularized by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser in her highly successful art-song arrangements, <span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> (1921&#150;5). During this period he even ventured into the ultra-conservative world of the highland bagpipers; <span class="italic">The Bagpipe: the History of a Musical Instrument</span> (1975) was very well received, but his piobaireachd &#145;The Lament for Calum Maclean&#146;, composed after the untimely death of a fellow worker in the school (brother to the great Gaelic poet Sorley Maclean), did not, unfortunately, enter the piping repertory.<br>
<br>Highly arranged folk-song, sung by classically trained professional singers to orchestral accompaniment, no matter how beautifully done, was looked at askance by later scholars and performers of traditional song. But in <span class="italic">Country Magazine</span> Collinson had been obliged to work to BBC practice, which was against &#145;untrained&#146; singers marring the airwaves, and when such Scottish singers were eventually broadcast in the late 1950s, popular reaction was indeed remarkably hostile, even from fervent Scottish nationalists such as Hugh MacDiarmid. But Collinson more than compensated for such early &#145;transgressions&#146; by the assiduity and accuracy of his later research and publication for the School of Scottish Studies. His writings, which cover in scholarly depth virtually the complete range of Scottish traditional music and song from both sides of the highland line, firmly remained classics in their field. It may well be regrettable that, as his <span class="italic">Scotsman</span> obituary commented, he attracted no honours, not even from his own university; that would in no way have concerned this thorough, kindly, generous, and gentle musician who valued most of all in life a capacity to enjoy whatever he was engaged upon. Collinson died on 21 December 1984 in Peel Hospital, Galashiels, and was buried in Mortlach churchyard, Dufftown, Banffshire, on the 28th.<br>
