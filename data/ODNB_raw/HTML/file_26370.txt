<span class="headword">Stephen,  Edward Jones</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Tanymarian]</span>  (1822&#150;1885), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was the son of Robert Jones and Jane Stephen of Rhyd-y-sarn, near Maentwrog, Merioneth, where he was born in November 1822. He was baptized Edward Jones at St Michael's Church, Ffestiniog, on 15 December 1822, but adopted his grandfather's name Stephen as an additional surname when he was at Bala Congregational college because there was another student there called Edward Jones. After a few years' attendance at Penrallt-goch School he was apprenticed to his brother, a clothier. About 1841 he began preaching, and in 1843 entered the Bala Congregational college where he remained for three years. In 1847 he was ordained pastor of Horeb Chapel at Dwygyfylchi, near Penmaen-mawr, Caernarvonshire, but in November 1856 he moved to take charge of another pastorate at Llanllechid, Bangor, where he lived at a house called Tanymarian, the name by which he was thereafter chiefly known. He died on 10 May 1885, leaving a widow, Eliza, and several children, and was buried in Bethlehem Chapel graveyard, Tal-y-bont, Llanllechid.<br>
<br>In music, Stephen was entirely self-taught. A series of articles on music that he contributed to <span class="italic">Y Cronicl</span> in 1848&#150;9 raised him into sudden popularity, which he further increased by delivering lectures on the subject, interspersed with vocal illustrations that he sang himself. Between January 1821 and May 1852, while at Dwygyfylchi, he composed his oratorio <span class="italic">Ystorm Tiberias</span>, which was published at Bethesda in seven parts in 1855. It was the first oratorio of its kind by a Welsh composer, but it had no distinctively Welsh characteristic and was influenced mainly by Handel. Its strength lies in its choruses, some of which, especially &#145;Dyma'r gwyntoedd yn ymosod&#146;, became popular with Welsh choirs and were adopted as eisteddfod test pieces. The airs had numerous defects, which Stephen more or less remedied in the revised score that was published posthumously at Dolgellau in 1887 under the editorship of D. Emlyn Evans, with improved English words by the Revd J. H. Johnes.<br>
<br>Apart from his oratorio, Stephen's fame rests chiefly on the service he rendered to congregational singing among the Congregationalists of Wales, as John Roberts (1822&#150;1877) did among the Methodists. In 1859 he became editor of the musical portion of the Welsh hymnal <span class="italic">Cerddor y cyssegr</span> (Bethesda, 1860), which contains several melodies harmonized by Stephen but no tune of his own composition. This was superseded by the publication at Wrexham in 1868 of a new hymnal, <span class="italic">Llyfr tonau ac emynau</span>, under the joint editorship of Stephen and Joseph David Jones of Ruthin, the chief burden of the work falling on the latter. This was followed in 1879 by a supplement edited by Stephen alone, containing six tunes of his own, the best known being &#145;Tanymarian&#146;. This edition also carried the first publication of Joseph Parry's &#145;Aberystwyth&#146;. The completed hymnal contains more than 300 tunes and 900 hymns, and was widely used by Welsh Congregationalists.<br>
<br>Between April 1861 and May 1863 Stephen edited <span class="italic">Greal y corau</span>. He was a noted singer as well as a composer. His hymns are the most lasting part of his output but he also produced a number of art-music works, the most significant being a requiem (Bethesda, 1858) on the death of the Revd John Jones (1796&#150;1857) of Tal-y-sarn (Talsarn). Stephen, who was also an amateur geologist, wrote several papers in Welsh on geology, and his collection of specimens was presented to the University College of North Wales, Bangor.<br>
<br>The Welsh memoir of Stephen, edited by W. J. Parry, <span class="italic">Cofiant Tanymarian</span> (1886), contains two portraits of him. There is appended a selection of his prose and poetical compositions, together with several anthems and partsongs.<br>
