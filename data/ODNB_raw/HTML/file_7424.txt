<span class="headword">Heere,  Lucas  de</span>  (1534&#150;1584), <span class="occ">painter and poet</span>, was born in Ghent, the second son of Jan de Heere, a sculptor, and Anna Smijters, a miniaturist. Having presumably received some training at home, he was apprenticed to Frans Floris. The painter and biographer Karel van Mander was subsequently de Heere's pupil and the biography written by the former provides much information. Only one signed work survives by de Heere: <span class="italic">Solomon and Sheba</span> (1559; cathedral church of St Bavo, Ghent), in which the face of Solomon is recognizably that of Philip II of Spain. Both de Heere and his father were employed in July 1559 on the decorations for the final chapter of the order of the Golden Fleece in Ghent Cathedral, with which this painting may be connected. A <span class="italic">View of the Estate of St Bavo</span> (Rijksuniversiteit, Ghent) and a <span class="italic">Crucifixion</span> (St Pauwels, near St Niklaas, Oost-Vlaanderen) have been ascribed to de Heere on the basis of documents. <span class="italic">The Liberal Arts Slumbering in Time of War</span> (Galleria Sabauda, Turin) has also been attributed to him, by comparison with the signed drawing of the <span class="italic">Three Virtues Asleep</span> (1564; Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich), but this attribution remains inconclusive.<br>
<br>De Heere was a member of the chamber of rhetoric known as Jesus with the Balsam Flower and wrote numerous poems, of which the best known today are included in the anthology of his poetic works <span class="italic">De hof en boemgaerd der poesien</span> (&#145;The Garden and Orchard of Poetry&#146;), compiled in 1561. This volume refers to the status of art and artists and to the pre-eminence of painting among the liberal and mechanical arts, and includes a mythical contest in which Apollo decides in favour of art (then regarded as a manual and not an intellectual activity) over the accepted liberal art categories of the <i>trivium</i> and <i>quadrivium</i>, by reference to the book of <span class="roman">Exodus</span>. It also contains a defence of his old master, Floris, against an anonymous attack. Van Mander stated that during the iconoclasm that swept the Low Countries in 1566 de Heere hid some of Floris's works. Van Mander also recorded that de Heere wrote biographies of artists, but that he (van Mander) did not succeed in obtaining them; presumably they were inspirational to him. In a letter of September 1582 to the duc d'Anjou, de Heere referred to his employment by d'Anjou's mother, Catherine de' Medici, queen of France, in 1559&#150;60. The designs for the Valois tapestries, 1582&#150;5 (Uffizi, Florence), long considered to have been made by a Netherlandish artist with a connection to d'Anjou, have plausibly been attributed on stylistic grounds to de Heere, who is recorded by van Mander as travelling to France at an unspecified date, where he made tapestry designs. As members of the reformed religion, de Heere and his wife, Eleanora Carboniers, were proscribed by name in 1568, but may have fled to London as early as 1566. They are recorded there in 1571 and 1576. While in England, de Heere painted a gallery with the costumes of all nations for Edward Fiennes Clinton, earl of Lincoln (destr.). This included an Englishman unable to choose which clothes to wear, an image said to have amused Elizabeth I and to be typical of the nation. Drawings of costumes of the British Isles are also included in his <span class="italic">Beschriving der Britsche Eilanden</span> (1573&#150;5; BL) and <span class="italic">Theatre de tous le peuples et nations de la terre</span> (1568 and later; Ghent University Library). The attribution to de Heere of <span class="italic">The Family of Henry VIII: an Allegory of the Tudor Succession</span> (<i>c</i>.1572; National Museum and Gallery, Cardiff), an image intended to reinforce Elizabeth I's right to the throne, is probably correct. This work belonged to Francis Walsingham whose contacts with de Heere are referred to in a letter dated July 1576 from William of Orange  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Huguenot Society</span>, 4, 1891&#150;3, 39). Portraits formerly attributed to de Heere on the basis of the monogram HE have been reattributed to Hans Eworth; consequently, the extent of de Heere's <i>&#339;uvre</i> during his English period has been much reduced. He contributed drawings and poetry to the friendship books of his fellow exiles Abraham Ortelius (Pembroke College, Cambridge), Emanuel van Meteren (Bodl. Oxf.), and the merchant Jan Radermacher (Ghent University Library). The device of the <span class="italic">Siren Luring Sailors to their Doom</span>, which he drew in a fictive oval frame with accompanying verses on 2 August 1576 in the book belonging to the painter Joris Hoefnagel (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), bears his punning motto &#145;Schade Leer U&#146; (&#145;Misfortune teaches you&#146;) which van Mander stated that he adopted as an anagram of his name. While in London de Heere took John de Critz the elder, sergeant-painter 1605&#150;42, as a pupil. De Heere and his wife returned to Ghent after the pacification in 1576 and he was subsequently involved in the celebrations that took place on the announcement of an engagement between Elizabeth I and the duc d'Anjou in 1581, and the triumphal entries into Ghent of William of Orange in 1577 and the duc d'Anjou in 1582. De Heere died on 29 August 1584, possibly in Paris.<br>
