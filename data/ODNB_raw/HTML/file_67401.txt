<span class="headword">Freke,  John</span>  (1652&#150;1717), <span class="occ">lawyer and conspirator</span>, was born in Hilton, Dorset, on 18 March 1652 and baptized at All Saints' Church, Hilton, on 17 April 1652, the eldest of the three sons and two daughters of John Freke (<i>d</i>. in or before 1658) and his wife, Margaret Knightly, of Winterborne Stickland, Dorset. An eighteenth-century family pedigree mistakenly identified him as the son of Robert Freke. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 2 April 1669, entered the Middle Temple in the same year, and was called to the bar on 5 May 1676.<br>
<br>Even before being called to the bar John Freke appears to have been committed to a radicalism that would lead the authorities, his second cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48931/', "Elizabeth Freke")</script> recalled, &#145;three severall times&#146; to seek his hanging  (<span class="italic">Remembrances</span>, 45). The first incident involved the authorship of an intemperate political poem variously entitled <span class="italic">The History of the Insipids</span> and <span class="italic">The Chronicle</span>. A heavy-handed satire that culminates in the exhortation &#145;Let's pull all brutish tyrants down&#146; prompted a warrant for his apprehension. Brought before the king's bench on 6 June 1676, he was released on bail because of insufficient witnesses but remained under the threat of prosecution for high treason until September. Within a year he was linked with the first earl of Shaftesbury; soon he also became a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>, a group of whigs who gathered at the King's Head tavern on Fleet Street. His association with the supporters of Shaftesbury, if not his presence in the earl's inner circle, is further implicit in his signature on a 1679 petition for a new parliament and his role in the Rye House plot of 1683. Freke was among those sought by the privy council in July 1683 for furthering the uprising against the crown encouraged by such men as Lord Russell, Algernon Sidney, and Robert Ferguson. Though Freke admitted only that as Ferguson's counsel he had advised him to flee if guilty, others implicated in the plot characterized him as a conduit for money and a link with the western gentry. Two years later, in May 1685, officials again took him into custody for his alleged efforts in the western counties to assist the duke of Monmouth's rebellion. Released on bail, Freke went to Tunbridge, then joined other exiles in Europe.<br>
<br>In the Netherlands, Freke formed a warm and enduring friendship with the philosopher John Locke. The correspondence between the two men that began in November 1686 reveals a close personal and political relationship. Over time Freke advised Locke about legal affairs, commented on the books and manuscripts the philosopher shared with him, and helped supervise some of his publications. By November 1694 Freke and their mutual friend Edward Clarke were members of Locke's &#145;College&#146;, the centre of a limited and informal group intent upon influencing political policies. In the next two years Locke particularly relied upon Clarke's position as a member of parliament and Freke's friendship with the lord chancellor, John Somers, to promote his concerns about censorship, recoinage, and banking. Gradually the need for &#145;the College&#146; diminished and the correspondence waned; the friendship, however, continued until the philosopher's death in 1704: Locke's will entrusted &#145;my good Freind John Freke of the Middle Temple&#146; with the disposal of &pound;100  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Locke</span>, 8.424&#150;5). During the 1690s Freke was one of the whig reformers associated with the Grecian Coffee House in Devereaux Court in the Strand; and by 1701, identified as a propagandist for so-called junto whigs, he and Clarke were mocked as the impersonations E. C. and J. F. in <span class="italic">The Taunton Dean Letter</span> and <span class="italic">Letter from the Grecian Coffee-House</span>.<br>
<br>Once Freke moved away from the centre of London politics, he became entrusted with the legal affairs of his second cousin Elizabeth Freke and figured prominently in her unpublished memoirs. Her complaints about his handling of her financial and legal affairs in Ireland and England provide some sense of the lawyer's life in the years 1702 to 1713. Little else is certain. His will was signed on 25 June 1717 and proved on 8 August 1717, though the date and place of burial are unknown. Having never married Freke left his sister Elizabeth and her three children part of the estate; the bulk, which the Freke genealogy estimated at &pound;7000 or &pound;8000, went to his sister Anne Broadrepp.<br>
