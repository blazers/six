<span class="headword">Lyford,  William</span>  (1597?&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Peasemore, near Newbury, Berkshire, one of at least five children of William Lyford (<i>d</i>. 1631/2), the rector there. He matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 28 April 1615, aged seventeen, became a demy of Magdalen College in 1617, and graduated BA on 15 December 1618. A fellow from 1620, he proceeded MA on 14 June 1621, was ordained, and in 1624 also became a fellow of Pembroke College.<br>
<br>In 1630 Lyford published, as <span class="italic">The Tryall of a Christians Syncere Love unto Christ</span>, a posthumous edition of sermons by his Magdalen contemporary William Pinke (<i>c</i>.1599&#150;1629), a trenchantly anti-Catholic work which he dedicated to Pinke's former student George Digby. Having obtained his BD degree on 12 May 1631, on 5 July he supplicated for a licence to preach. In 1632, following the death of his father, Lyford became rector of his home parish of Peasemore (a living occupied by 1637 by his younger brother Edward (<i>b</i>. 1605/6)); however, it seems to have been his institution in 1631 or 1632 to the Dorset vicarage of Sherborne, on the presentation of the king and at the suggestion of George Digby's father, John Digby, earl of Bristol, that led him in 1633 to resign his Magdalen fellowship. Soon afterwards he married his wife, Elizabeth, who outlived him.<br>
<br>Lyford published in 1642 the first edition of his <span class="italic">Principles of Faith and Good Conscience</span>, a catechism designed as a three-year course of preparation for communion, with a chapter for each week and some repetition &#145;of purpose better to root those main points in weak understandings&#146;  (A4); this was subsequently abridged for young people (1649, 1656). On 23 October the following year he was cited by the House of Commons to attend the Westminster assembly, of which he was nominally a member, but he did not sit. According to Richard Baxter, he believed that parliamentarians had acted unlawfully in going to war against the king, and John Walker assumed he was a royalist, but there is no evidence that Lyford attracted parliament's disapproval: he received an augmentation of his stipend from the county committee and in 1647 was one of the committee of triers of ministers. On 12 December that year he preached at St Mary's, Oxford, a traditional Calvinist exposition of the regeneration and sanctification of the elect, published as <span class="italic">The Translation of the Sinner from Death to Life</span> (1648).<br>
<br>From 1647, according to his own later account, in the wake of <span class="italic">The Testimonie of the London Ministers</span>, Lyford became involved in the controversy over toleration, drawing up &#145;exercises&#146; to encourage his &#145;people&#146; not to &#145;condemn all things in the Lump, but bee able to discern things that differ&#146;  (Lyford, dedication). In a sermon preached before the sheriff, Sir Gerard Napper, at Dorchester assizes on 17 July 1651 and published posthumously as <span class="italic">The matching of the magistrates authority and the Christians true liberty in matters of religion</span> (1654), Lyford steered what he hoped was a moderate and sober course between the magistrate's duty to promote preaching and restrain idolatry and the people's liberty not to be forced into a particular act of worship. He also eschewed extremes in <span class="italic">An Apologie for our Publick Ministerie and Infant Baptism</span> (1652), dedicated to John Raymond, and in his last <span class="italic">Three Sermons Preached at Sherborne</span> (1654), but despite acknowledging the roles of faithful &#145;private Christians&#146; and even of unordained preachers in being &#145;a just rebuke to a rotten, formal, dead Clergie&#146;  (ibid., 22), both works are trenchant defences of an ordained and publicly maintained ministry.<br>
<br>Lyford died at Sherborne on 3 October 1653 and was buried in the chancel of his church. An address given by &#145;W. H.&#146; at his funeral was reproduced in an edition of his <span class="italic">The Plain Mans Senses Exercised</span> (1655), a lengthy further contribution to the toleration controversy. By his will dated 2 September 1653 Lyford left money and land in Dorset, Berkshire, and Hampshire to his son William and seven daughters, and &pound;120 for an exhibition for a poor scholar at Magdalen College, &#145;by way of thankfullnes for [God's] mercy to me in that Colledge, and in way of Restitution for a summ of money which according to the corrupt custome of those daies I did receave for the Resignation of my fellowship&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/239, fol. 385). William Lyford the younger (<i>d</i>. 1678) had matriculated at Magdalen the previous November, and it was in his study there that on 22 October 1653 he wrote the dedication to his father's <span class="italic">The Matching of the Magistrate's Authority</span>.<br>
