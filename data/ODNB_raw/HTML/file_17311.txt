<span class="headword">Lyttelton,  William Henry</span>, first Baron Lyttelton and first Baron Westcote  (1724&#150;1808), <span class="occ">colonial governor and diplomat</span>, was born on 24 December 1724 in London, the sixth son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, fourth baronet (1685&#150;1751), and of his wife, Christian (1688&#150;1759), daughter of Sir Richard Temple. He was at school at Eton College before going to Oxford, where he matriculated at St Mary Hall on 22 June 1742. He entered the Middle Temple on 1 November 1743 and was called to the bar in 1748. Rather than practising the law, however, he went into politics with the encouragement of his kinsman William Pitt, being returned to the House of Commons for his father's borough of Bewdley in 1748. Pitt seems to have been instrumental in his obtaining the governorship of the colony of South Carolina in 1755.<br>
<br>After being captured at sea and briefly confined in France, Lyttelton reached South Carolina on 1 June 1756. The colony was very rich, exporting great quantities of rice and indigo, but its small white population, heavily outnumbered by African slaves, made it very vulnerable to attack either by the French or by the Native American peoples of the interior. Lyttelton was successful in persuading the fractious assembly that represented the white community to vote money for the colony's defence and to accept policies aimed at conciliating the native peoples. However, relations with the most powerful of them, the Cherokees, remained tense. When in 1759 approximately twenty-four Englishmen were murdered on the Cherokee frontier Lyttelton rejected the credentials of a Cherokee peace delegation and led an armed incursion into Cherokee territory in order to force his own uncompromising terms on the Cherokees. Lyttelton demanded that twenty-four Cherokees be surrendered for execution and that the Cherokees should also kill any French emissaries. Lyttelton's actions provoked a long and costly war, but initially it was widely supported both in South Carolina and in Britain.<br>
<br>Lyttelton learned in February 1760 that on the strength of his apparent success he had been promoted to the governorship of Jamaica. His friend and political ally, George Montagu Dunk, earl of Halifax, president of the Board of Trade, told him that although the people of South Carolina were losing &#145;the best governor they ever had&#146;, he was getting &#145;the best government his Majesty has to bestow&#146;  (letter of 15 Nov 1759, Lyttelton MSS). Lyttelton left South Carolina for Britain on 4 June 1760. Before leaving Britain for Jamaica he married on 2 June 1761 Mary, daughter of James Macartney of Longford in Ireland. They had two sons and a daughter. She died in Jamaica on 28 May 1765.<br>
<br>Jamaica, with its great sugar plantations, was the most valued of all British colonies. It too, however, had acute problems of defence and of an assertive white population, often at loggerheads with the governor through their assembly. In December 1764 Lyttelton was drawn into a long and bitter dispute with the assembly over members' claims to the privilege of judicial immunity. Lyttelton believed that such claims were both &#145;destructive of the just Influence of His Majesty's Prerogative&#146; and contrary to &#145;Publick Justice&#146; and to the rights of individuals  (Greene, 30). In the hope of avoiding conflict while maintaining his position Lyttelton dissolved the assembly three times, but each new assembly&#151;meeting from March to June 1765, in August 1765, and May 1766&#151;continued to assert the privilege of judicial immunity. Lyttelton's threat to seek new powers from the British parliament was at first supported by the Grenville ministry, but the Rockingham administration preferred that he pursue compromise. Unwilling to change his policy Lyttelton left Jamaica on 2 June 1766, leaving his lieutenant-governor, Roger Hope Elletson, to follow the path of conciliation.<br>
<br>Lyttelton served as ambassador to Portugal from 1767 to 1770, when he left on leave, resigning when required to return. In Britain he married his second wife, Caroline (1745/6&#150;1809), daughter of John Bristowe of Quidenham, Norfolk, on 19 February 1774. They had a son and a daughter. Lyttelton was returned for parliament again for Bewdley in 1774, holding the seat until 1790. He consistently supported the government of Lord North, serving as a lord of the Treasury from 1777 to 1782. In 1776 he was given the Irish title of Baron Westcote of Ballymore. He inherited in 1779 the estates of his nephew Thomas Lyttelton, including the new house at Hagley in Worcestershire, which became his seat. In his few recorded Commons speeches, no doubt influenced by his experiences as a governor, Lyttelton insisted on enforcing the rights of Britain over the colonies by coercion and war, if need be. He went into opposition with North after 1783, but left him to adhere to the Pitt administration in 1787. In 1794 he was given a British peerage as Baron Lyttelton of Frankley.<br>
<br>Lyttelton shared some of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17306/', "George Lyttelton's")</script> ambitions as a poet and man of letters, privately publishing a volume entitled <span class="italic">Trifles in Verse</span> in 1803. In his youth he went on the grand tour of Europe with Henry Thrale, and through Thrale's wife, Hester, became acquainted with Samuel Johnson, who dismissed him as having &#145;more chaff than grain in him&#146;  (Balderston, 1.300). Oxford University made him an honorary DCL in 1781.<br>
<br>Lyttelton died on 14 September 1808 at Hagley, and was buried there. He was survived by his second wife, Caroline, who died on 19 September 1809 at Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire; by his eldest son with his first wife, George Fulke (1763&#150;1828), who succeeded as second Baron Lyttelton and Westcote; and by his children with his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17312/', "William Henry Lyttelton, later third Baron Lyttelton and Westcote (1782&#150;1837)")</script>, and Caroline Anne (<i>d</i>. 1833), who married Reginald Pole-Carew (1753&#150;1835), MP. He was predeceased by the other children from his first marriage, Charles (<i>d</i>. 1781) and Hester (<i>d</i>. 1785), who had married Sir Richard Colt Hoare.<br>
