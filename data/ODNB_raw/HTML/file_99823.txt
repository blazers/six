<span class="headword">Cosgrove,  Denis Edmund</span>  (1948&#150;2008), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 3 May 1948 at 16 Kenilworth Road, Liverpool, the second of the six children of Peter Cyril Cosgrove (1910&#150;1980), bank clerk, later bank manager, and his wife, Gwendoline Brenda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackrill (<i>b</i>. 1922). He was raised in a lower middle-class, devoutly Catholic, household, his father being of Irish descent. He was educated at St Francis Xavier's College, a prominent Jesuit secondary school which his father had also attended. As an academic high flyer he was initially obliged to give up the study of geography in favour of Latin and Greek, but later selected the subject for study at a higher level. The first member of his family to attend any university, he won an open scholarship to read geography at St Catherine's College, Oxford (1966&#150;9), and completed a masters degree at the University of Toronto (1969&#150;70).<br>
<br>Cosgrove's return to Oxford in 1970 was inspired by personal commitment as much as academic ambition: Isobel Thubron (<i>b</i>. 1943), whom he married in New York on 25 September 1970, had recently been appointed to the post of demonstrator in the university's school of geography. She was the daughter of Samuel Thubron, financial director of Clarke Chapman Engineering. They had two daughters, Emily and Isla. After their marriage Cosgrove registered for a postgraduate degree and was eventually awarded a DPhil in 1976, though by then he was well established as an academic. His first professional employment, in 1971&#150;2, was as a researcher in the built environment research group of the Polytechnic of Central London, where his job was to assist in the development of computer planning models. In 1972 he was appointed as lecturer in human geography at Oxford Polytechnic, where he flourished as a teacher and administrator, rising to principal lecturer and chair of the geography section.<br>
<br>In 1980 he moved to the recently established department of geography at Loughborough University as lecturer, becoming reader in 1983. There he helped to create an influential new school of cultural geography, oriented towards historical studies of landscape iconography. Having previously held visiting professorships at the University of Toronto, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Oregon, he was now set on widening his horizons further. In 1994 he was appointed to a chair in human geography at Royal Holloway, University of London. There he established a new masters programme in cultural geography and became dean of the graduate school, as well as being founder editor (also in 1994) of <span class="italic">Ecumene</span> (subsequently renamed <span class="italic">Cultural Geographies</span>). In 2000 he was appointed to the newly endowed Alexander Von Humboldt chair of geography in the University of California, Los Angeles. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, on 2 December 1989 he married Carmen Patricia Mills (<i>b</i>. 1964), daughter of Richard Aldous Mills, geologist. They had one son, Leon.<br>
<br>One of Cosgrove's principal achievements as a scholar was to develop a compelling rationale for geography as a humanities discipline at a time when the subject was dominated by models drawn from the physical and social sciences. In his view geographical enquiry was equally concerned with the technical, material, and imaginative engagement between people and places. Early in his career he was drawn to the works of Ruskin, and Renaissance ideas of landscape as reflected in sixteenth-century Vicenza and the Veneto. These concerns were reflected in a series of influential books, including <span class="italic">Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape</span> (1984), <span class="italic">The Palladian Landscape</span> (1993), and <span class="italic">The Iconography of Landscape</span> (1988, co-edited with Stephen Daniels). His later writings on mapping drew him to fruitful collaborations with scholars and artists in England and North America. Throughout his career he maintained an enduring interest in the relationships between geography and cosmography, resulting in his <i>magnum opus</i> on imaginative geographies of the globe, <span class="italic">Apollo's Eye: a Cartographic Genealogy of the Earth in the Western Imagination</span> (2001). His publications had a significant impact well beyond his chosen discipline, notably within architecture and the visual arts, and were widely translated. In 1988 he won the Back award of the Royal Geographical Society for contributions to human geography, and in 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Talinn, Estonia.<br>
<br>Cosgrove's academic outlook was inspired by a strong sense of the connections between scholarship, pedagogy, and ethics. He was a humane scholar who made possible a more expansive vision of geography as a creative discipline, an inspiring teacher who changed the way his students thought about the world and their place within it, and a trusted colleague and mentor, whose convivial and generous approach to life inspired many of those who knew him. He died on 21 March 2008 at his home in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, having been diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2006. Memorial meetings were held in May 2008 at the UCLA Fowler Museum, Los Angeles, and at the Royal Geographical Society, London. His ashes were scattered, according to his wishes, at two of his favourite places: Malibu, Los Angeles, and Parliament Hill, London. He was survived by his wife, Carmen, and his three children.<br>
