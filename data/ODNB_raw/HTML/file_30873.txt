<span class="headword">Bullock, Sir  Ernest</span>  (1890&#150;1979), <span class="occ">organist and music teacher</span>, was born in Wigan, Lancashire, on 15 September 1890, the youngest child of Thomas Bullock and his wife, Eliza Stout. He had one sister, the eldest of the family, and four brothers, and both his parents died while he was still at school. As a small boy he joined the choir at Wigan parish church, an event that proved decisive by bringing him into the care of E. C. Bairstow, then organist at Wigan. Bairstow recognized the boy's talent and his difficult circumstances, and took him as an articled pupil, providing general education at Wigan grammar school. When Bairstow moved to Leeds parish church in 1906 he took the pupil with him into his own home, and assumed responsibility for his musical education. Bullock received his BMus (Durham) in 1908 and passed the FRCO examination in 1909. Appointed in 1912 to be assistant to S. H. Nicholson at Manchester Cathedral, Bullock soon became known as a promising composer of church music, chamber music, and songs. In 1914 he obtained his DMus (Durham) but it was not until 1919, after four years of distinguished service in France as a captain and adjutant in the King's Own Yorkshire light infantry, that he was able to return to music. A few months as organist at St Michael's College, Tenbury, Worcestershire, prepared him for an important spell from October 1919 to January 1928 as organist at Exeter Cathedral, where, with determination that was considered at times ruthless, he put new life into the music of the cathedral, the diocese, and the region. In 1919 he married Margery, daughter of George Hope Newborn, solicitor, of Epworth, Lincolnshire. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>When Bullock moved to Westminster Abbey in 1928 he brought similar reforming energy into a reorganization of the daily choral offices and many special occasions, the most spectacular of which was the coronation of George VI on 12 May 1937, for which Bullock composed fanfares and acted as joint musical director. After the bombing in 1940, in which his house (with all his property and papers) was destroyed, the abbey's musical establishment had to be dispersed, and Bullock's career seemed to be in ruins. In 1941, however, he was appointed to be principal of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, a post at that time involving also the Gardiner professorship of music in the University of Glasgow. In his eleven years in Glasgow Bullock made a significant contribution to Scottish music, and he chaired the music committee of the Scottish Arts Council from 1943 to 1950. He was also a member of the music panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain (1945&#150;7).<br>
<br>Bullock returned to London in January 1953 to succeed Sir George Dyson as director of the Royal College of Music, where his skill in dealing with temperamental students and even more temperamental professors was much admired. His own musical influence, moreover, was more far-reaching than was immediately recognized, his classes in improvisation, in particular, being considered as among the finest experiences that the curriculum offered. From 1952 until 1960 he was joint chair of the associated board of the Royal Schools of Music.<br>
<br>Although circumstances did not allow him to devote a major part of his time to composition, Bullock produced throughout his career a steady stream of music, principally for church use. His published output included three evening services, two <span class="roman">Te Deums</span>, and a <span class="roman">Jubilate</span>, twenty anthems and motets, and a small quantity of organ music and secular songs. His style, derived from Sir C. H. H. Parry and Sir C. V. Stanford, is today regarded as highly conservative, but his music remains effective in the liturgical context for which much of it was intended. In his music, as in his life, Bullock was disciplined, fastidious, and somewhat austere. His friends could rely on absolute loyalty and generosity but realized that there was no welcome for anything frivolous, pretentious, or effusive.<br>
<br>Bullock was appointed CVO in 1937 and was knighted in 1951. In 1955 he was given an honorary LLD at Glasgow University. He was also honorary RAM and president of the Incorporated Society of Musicians (1947) and of the Royal College of Organists (1951&#150;2). After retirement from the Royal College of Music in 1960 he settled at Welby Cottage in Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, where he died on 23 May 1979. His wife, a devoted companion for sixty years, survived him by only a few months.<br>
