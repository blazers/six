<span class="headword">Osborne,  Peregrine</span>, second duke of Leeds  (<em>bap. </em>1659, <em>d.</em> 1729), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 29 December 1659 at Harthill, Yorkshire, fifth of the eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20884/', "Thomas Osborne, first duke of Leeds (1632&#150;1712)")</script>, and his wife, Bridget (<i>bap</i>. 1629, <i>d</i>. 1704), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2274/', "Montagu Bertie, second earl of Lindsey")</script>, and his first wife, Martha. Osborne was tutored privately and, to complete his education, on 16 March 1671 accompanied his eldest brother to France for nine months. His father secured for him in 1673 reversions to the clerkship of the patents in the court of chancery and the lucrative auditorship of the exchequer, but he never obtained either office. On 15 December 1674, after his father became earl of Danby, Thomas Osborne's former Scottish title of Viscount Osborne of Dunblane was regranted to his son; in the new patent the title was given as Viscount Dumblane, by which Osborne was known until 1689. Though under age he was elected MP for Berwick upon Tweed in 1677, and spent a month attached to Ralph Montagu's Paris embassy, to learn the art of diplomacy. As a member of the court party, he was classed by Shaftesbury as &#145;thrice vile&#146;  (Cruickshanks, 184). He became MP for Corfe Castle, Dorset, on 26 February 1679, only to be unseated in April on petition. From 1679 to 1682 he actively sought his father's release from the Tower.<br>
<br>Danby aimed to marry his son to a wealthy heiress, Bridget (1662&#150;1734), daughter of Sir Thomas Hyde, second baronet, of Aldbury, Hertfordshire, and stepdaughter of the goldsmith-banker Sir Robert Viner, one of Danby's foremost business allies. Unfortunately, when aged twelve she had allegedly married her cousin John Emerton. While Danby was occupied in protracted legal and financial proceedings to get this marriage annulled, Dumblane wooed the heiress into a private marriage at St Marylebone Church on 25 April 1682. They had two sons (the elder died of smallpox in 1711) and two daughters; Dumblane also had an illegitimate son, who was a midshipman in 1729.<br>
<br>In June 1685 Dumblane was slightly wounded in Feversham's army at the battle of Sedgemoor. He became a feckless spendthrift and, having squandered most of his wife's fortune and accumulated debts of &pound;10,000, fled to the continent, only ten days after his wife miscarried, to avoid his creditors. On his return to England in January 1687 his financial affairs were put firmly under his father's control. In April 1688 he carried letters for Danby to William of Orange and, anticipating William's invasion, in November raided Welbeck, home of the duke of Newcastle, for arms. Elected MP for York in the Convention Parliament (January 1689), Dumblane, though nominal leader of his father's tory group, showed little interest in parliamentary matters. Although he voted on 5 February against declaring the throne vacant, the next day he followed Danby's change of heart in pledging loyalty to William, publicly recanting in the House of Commons. He was rewarded by a warrant for the office of postmaster-general; inexplicably it went to John Wildman, the veteran ex-republican. On his father's elevation to the marquessate on 20 April 1689, Dumblane was styled earl of Danby.<br>
<br>His naval career developed from his hobby of designing yachts. In the summer of 1689 the new earl of Danby fitted out a privateer, an action which caused his father to seek a warrant for his arrest for treason; he was released after House of Commons protests at this breach of its privileges. On 3 March 1690 he was summoned to the House of Lords in his father's barony as Lord Osborne of Kiveton; for a time he attended with exemplary regularity, but he rarely spoke. In the same year he used one of his speedy yachts to arrest Lord Preston and other Jacobite conspirators <i>en route</i> for France. He fought gallantly as second in command of the naval force in the unsuccessful attack on Brest, and commanded a regiment of dragoons raised by the City of London after the Anglo-Dutch defeat off Beachy Head on 30 June. This loyalty secured him the post of colonel commanding the first regiment of marines ever formed. His impulsive generosity and unpredictability endeared him to his ships' crews.<br>
<br>After showing conspicuous gallantry at Barfleur in 1692, Danby was allowed to fly a special swallowtail pennant. If his offer to reconnoitre Brest had been taken up, French capture of the merchant fleet bound for Smyrna might have been avoided. On 12 July 1693 he was promoted to rear-admiral of the red, and given command of a special flotilla of bomb-vessels and fireships for an attack on St Malo. He became rear-admiral of the blue in January 1694, and the Admiralty backed his views on the girdling of ships against Navy Board opposition. After his father became duke of Leeds on 4 May, Peregrine became known as marquess of Carmarthen. His spirited exploits at Camarets Bay in 1694 were followed by publication of his <span class="italic">Journal of the Brest Expedition</span>. In the summer of 1695 he was escorting home the eighty-sail Cadiz merchant fleet when he mistook eighteen East Indiamen for the French Brest squadron; considering himself outnumbered he retired to Milford Haven, where, wind-bound, he failed to prevent five of the East Indiamen falling into French hands. Summoned back to London, he was sacrificed by the Admiralty to mercantile ire, though a committee of the House of Lords praised his courage and fidelity.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1697 William III presented Tsar Peter the Great, in the Netherlands, with the <i>Royal Transport</i>, a heavily armed yacht designed by Carmarthen, and described  (Luttrell, 4.290) as the &#145;best sailer&#146; in the fleet. Peter was so pleased with the vessel that on his visit to England in 1698 he sought out Carmarthen, who had further improved its sailing performance. A model of the ship in the St Petersburg naval museum shows it to have had a schooner rig, so that it could sail closer to the wind than any contemporary square-rigged warship. Russian sources suggest that Carmarthen had a large collection of ships' models, and that Tsar Peter bought similar models on his advice. The marquess became quite intimate with Peter, and introduced him to his favourite tipple, brandy laced with peppers. He helped organize a mock battle at Portsmouth in Peter's honour, and gave him directions for the creation of a modern Russian navy. He even recommended personnel to achieve this: Henry Farquarson, later professor of mathematics at the St Petersburg naval academy; John Perry, who supervised the building of Russian dockyards and canals; and shipbuilders Nye and Dean. As a reward Carmarthen was given by the tsar the sole privilege of importing tobacco into Russia, which he immediately assigned to the Heathcotes and other London merchants in return for a lump sum of 1000 guineas and &pound;1500 per annum for life. He received little of either grant.<br>
<br>In 1699 Carmarthen was assigned a special galley, the 190 ton <i>Peregrine</i>, built at his direction and at royal expense, in lieu of &pound;9000 arrears of a Charles II pension; however, William III refused to part with her, and a further compensatory pension of &pound;1000 per annum was never paid. Although some aristocratic naval appointments under Anne were clearly &#145;dormant&#146;, Carmarthen rose to be nominally vice-admiral of the red in 1703. In 1705 he led the squadron that shipped Marlborough to the Southern Netherlands, and wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Method for the Speedy Manning Her Majesty's Royal Navy</span>. His naval career culminated in his appointment on 21 December 1708 as admiral of the red. At the trial of Dr Sacheverell in March 1710 he voted with a minority of the lords for acquittal. On the death of his father he became duke of Leeds, though most of his father's estates went to his own son, on whom he became financially dependent. He was lord lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1713&#150;14.<br>
<br>After 1714 Leeds seems to have reverted to his earlier political loyalties. During the 1715 Jacobite rising he declared, &#145;I had not a thought when I engaged in [the 1688&#150;9 revolution] &hellip; that the Prince of Orange's landing would end in deposing the King&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, new edn, 7.511). 1716&#150;17 saw him plotting with Jacobites in France as Mr Laurence. Although Bolingbroke termed him a &#145;madman&#146;  (ibid.), in correspondence with the Jacobite King James III he was promised (on 6 April 1716) &pound;200,000, an earldom, and command of the fleet. While his wife, &#145;ruined by her cruel lord's inhuman usage&#146;  (ibid., 513), appealed in 1717 to the crown for assistance, Leeds remained in exile until pardoned in 1723. He died, in indigent circumstances, on 25 June 1729 and was buried at Aldbury, Hertfordshire on 4 July; his wife was buried with him on 16 March 1734. He was succeeded, as third duke of Leeds, by his second son, Peregrine (1691&#150;1731), who married as his first wife the daughter of Edward Harley, earl of Oxford.<br>
<br>A short, fair-complexioned, wiry figure, who in his youth played the violin well, Leeds was fiery (he fought at least three duels in 1693&#150;8), &#145;bold, volatile and somewhat eccentric&#146;  (Macaulay, 4.1966). Undoubtedly something of a rake, he was permanently impecunious, though unlucky in office and pension (and he spent considerable amounts in the interests of the crown and starving marines). Yet he was a committed and not unsuccessful naval commander, and innovative in ship design. His father's political influence probably helped in his pursuit of yachting experiments, in the face of considerable Admiralty opposition; but one modern authority goes as far as to suggest that &#145;if [tsar] Peter [the Great] is known &hellip; as the &#147;Father of the Russian Fleet&#148; &hellip; then surely [Osborne] can be regarded as at least its godfather&#146;  (Ryan, 81).<br>
