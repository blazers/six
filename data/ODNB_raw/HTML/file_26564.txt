<span class="headword">Stone,  Alfred</span>  (1840&#150;1878), <span class="occ">choir-trainer and music editor</span>, was born in Denmark Street, Bristol, on 12 February 1840, the son of Thomas Stone, a carpenter, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris. He was educated at the Bristol city school (Queen Elizabeth's Hospital) and displayed an aptitude for music early in life; he took organ lessons from John Davies Corfe, organist of Bristol Cathedral. After a short time working at Messrs Thomas' Bristol soap works, he made music his profession. In 1858, when aged only eighteen, he became organist of St Paul's Church, Clifton, and was successively organist of Arley Chapel (1862), Highbury Chapel (1863&#150;9), St Paul's once more (1869&#150;75), Christ Church, Clifton (1875&#150;8), and, by the mayor's appointment, the mayor's chapel, St Mark, Bristol (1873&#150;8). The choirs he trained became highly proficient, most notably at St Paul's.<br>
<br>In 1863, with Fred Morgan, Stone edited the first edition of <span class="italic">The Bristol Tune Book</span>, comprising 342 hymn tunes and chants, a few written by himself. The book quickly became popular, chiefly among nonconformists. In a third edition (1891), edited by Morgan and H. Elliot Button, the number of tunes reached 900, and it is said that more than three-quarters of a million copies were sold in England and abroad. No hymnbook apart from <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> has exercised a wider influence on congregational singing.<br>
<br>In 1863&#150;4 Stone adopted the tonic sol-fa system for teaching, although he did not completely abandon the old notation. His teaching appointments included that of master of singing at Queen Elizabeth's Hospital (1867&#150;76), the Bristol Red Maids School (1867&#150;78), and the Blind Asylum (1876&#150;8). He conducted the Bristol Orpheus Glee Society (founded in 1844) from 1876 until his death, and under his direction the society flourished. In 1872 he organized and trained a male-voice choir to compete at the national music meetings which were inaugurated that year at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, London. He won the prize (&pound;50) that year, and the following year obtained honourable mention. In 1873 he organized the first Bristol music festival; he served as secretary, chose and trained the festival choir of 300 voices, and conducted the preliminary concerts and intermediate Festival Society concerts until his death. The chorus singing won the highest praise from critics and the choir became a permanent institution.<br>
<br>Among Stone's other works were, for preparatory singing classes, an edition of <span class="italic">Progressive Exercises for Elementary and Advanced Mixed Choirs</span>, which remained in use into the twentieth century, and a series of papers, <span class="italic">Hints for Elementary Teaching</span>, in which he strongly advocated the tonic sol-fa system. His unfinished work on harmony included &#145;The common sense of the minor scale&#146;, which was published in the <span class="italic">Tonic Sol-Fa Reporter</span> (August 1878). Several of his arrangements for choir appeared in <span class="italic">The Choral Handbook</span> from 1885. He adjudicated at Welsh eisteddfodau and travelled in Germany with J. S. Curwen for the purposes of his work; he also edited the <span class="italic">German Glee Book</span>, published in Bristol by Smith &amp; Sons. His last public appearance was at a festival concert in November 1877, when he conducted J. L. R&ouml;ckel's <span class="italic">Ode in Memory of Titiens</span>. He died at Fern Hollow, Stoke Bishop, Westbury upon Trym, Gloucestershire, on 3 January 1878, leaving a wife, Mary Jane Stone, and five children. A memorial fund of &pound;2000 was raised on behalf of his family.<br>
<br>Stone was evidently a stimulating teacher and conductor, and his energy helped to popularize music and improve musical education in the west of England.<br>
