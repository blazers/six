<span class="headword">Ludlow,  George James</span>, third Earl Ludlow  (1758&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 12 December 1758, the second son of Peter, first Earl Ludlow (1730&#150;1803), comptroller of the household to George III, and his wife, Lady Frances Lumley-Saunderson (<i>d</i>. 1796), the eldest daughter of Thomas, third earl of Scarbrough. On 17 May 1778 he was appointed ensign in the 1st foot guards, in which he rose to the rank of regimental major on 9 May 1800. He was appointed brevet colonel (1795), major-general (1798), lieutenant-general (1805), and general (1814).<br>
<br>Ludlow embarked for America in the spring of 1781, and was with Lord Cornwallis at the surrender of Yorktown on 17 October 1781 when he was taken prisoner and narrowly escaped execution. George Washington sent him to New York with dispatches relating to Captain Charles Asgill, who was then being held captive by revolutionary forces. After his return from America Ludlow served in Flanders in 1793&#150;4 and lost his left arm in the affair near Roubaix on 17 May 1794. In 1800 he went to Ireland with the 2nd brigade of guards (consisting of the 1st battalions of Coldstream and 3rd foot guards), which he commanded in the Vigo expedition and in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, including the battles before Alexandria and the city's blockade. Following the breakup of the army in Egypt he held major-general's commands in the eastern counties and in Kent during the invasion alarms of 1803&#150;4, and commanded a division in the Hanover expedition of 1805 and in the Copenhagen expedition of 1807.<br>
<br>Ludlow was made KB on 26 September 1804 and GCB on the reconstitution of the order in 1815. He succeeded his brother Augustus, second Earl Ludlow, as third Earl Ludlow, Viscount Preston, and Baron Ludlow, all in the peerage of Ireland, in 1811. He was created Baron Ludlow in the United Kingdom peerage on 10 September 1831. He was equerry to the prince of Wales (1784&#150;95), a deputy governor of Berwick upon Tweed, a member of the consolidated board of general officers, a colonel in succession of the old 96th, of the 38th foot (from 1808 to 1836), and of the Scots Fusilier Guards, to which he was appointed on 30 May 1836. He died, unmarried, at his residence, Cople Hall, near Bedford, on 16 April 1842, when the titles became extinct and the Irish estates passed to the duke of Bedford.<br>
